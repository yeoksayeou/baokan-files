### Rumor of US Sending Banker Johnston to China to Investigate Financial Situation; Rooks et al. Emphasize Military Aid to China

[United Press International, Honolulu, 8th] This evening's local newspaper reported: According to reliable sources, President Truman has appointed New York banker and former Chairman of Chemical Bank & Trust Company, Johnston, to go to China to investigate the financial situation. Mr. Johnston is currently visiting his son in Honolulu and has received a phone call from the President. However, he is bedridden and unwilling to meet with reporters to comment. It is only known that he will soon fly to China on a military aircraft.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 8th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee has heard more testimony that the State Department's planned relief and economic aid to China should be accompanied by military assistance to the Chinese National Government, including weapons, ammunition, training, and tactical advisors. Former head of the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) China Office, Rooks, stated: To assist China, every possible effort should be made; unless the scale of assistance the Chinese government receives in military strength is sufficient to defeat the Chinese Communists, the economic situation will never be satisfactory. The proposed $570 million in economic aid is a reasonable figure, but only providing either economic or military aid, and not combining them, will be a waste. Rooks said that the benefits of U.S. economic aid can reach the Chinese people. He believes that the claim that relief supplies are being held back and cannot reach the Chinese people is an "exaggeration."

Former U.S. Ambassador to China and current director of the Export-Import Bank, Gauss, also told the committee: He believes that economic aid to China will be ineffective without a strong military plan.

Gauss expressed regret for the decisions made at the Yalta Conference, saying, "The current situation of the Chinese government is largely due to these decisions." Gauss denied rumors that Secretary of State Marshall had withheld the Export-Import Bank's report on loans to China, calling it "absolutely untrue." He stated that, on the contrary, Marshall had proposed loans to China to the bank, but the bank refused because there was "no reasonable guarantee of repayment."

[United Press International, Washington, 8th] Gauss declared today to the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the China issue is a hundred times more significant than the Greek issue. According to a friend who recently returned from China, the Communist Party is currently implementing a thorough reform of Marxism, and there are frequent reports of landlords being killed. When asked what the result would be if China could not be aided, Gauss replied: "Unfortunately, for a considerable period of time, the Chinese people will all be abandoned to Communism; but once the Communist Party controls the entire country, it will still be difficult to maintain. If China turns red now, the Communist Party will not be able to rule it either."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th] General Chennault plans to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 10th and 11th to testify on the issue of aid to China. Since arriving here, Chennault has avoided seeing guests, and his address remains a closely guarded secret. Chennault has not made any public statements.

### Siping Battle: Unprecedented Ferocity; National Army Firmly Defends Urban Area

[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 9th] The battle of Siping is extremely fierce. No fewer than 50,000 bandits, accompanied by an artillery brigade, are occupying the high ground in the southwest and northeast, fiercely bombarding various strongholds in the city. Gunsmoke and artillery fire fill the streets, especially the Tiedong District. The bandits are using the Third Column to fiercely attack the Beishan position north of Siping Street, which controls most of the urban area, so the fighting is the fiercest. The main force of the Seventh Column is attacking fiercely from the east of the city, and the First Squad and the Second Independent Division of Northern Manchuria are attacking from the south of the city. According to reports, most of the Tiexi District is still under the control of the National Army. The bandits' Second Column, about one division, and the Fifth Independent Division of Western Manchuria are fiercely attacking from areas north and west of the city suburbs.

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 9th] The battle of Siping is still progressing heroically.

Related sources stated that a defense of Baoding is inevitable. This time, the bandits have launched an offensive on the Pingbao section, with the following intentions: (1) to echo the battle situation in the Northeast, (2) to occupy Xushui and cut off Pingbao traffic, in order to isolate Baoding. However, the fortifications of Baoding are solid and there is absolutely no need to worry. Heavy National Army troops are stationed in the Pingbao area and have already completed strong deployments.

### Civil Air Transport Plane Flying from Shenyang to Qingdao Attacked by "Red Star" Plane; Plane Body and Passengers Fortunately Unharmed

[Our Correspondent, Qingdao, 9th] A No. 524 transport plane of Chennault's Air Transport Command, carrying 35 textile factory employees evacuating from Shenyang, flew to Qingdao at 3:00 PM on the 8th. Two hours later, when it reached the Bohai Sea, about 150 miles from Qingdao, it encountered two Soviet P36 fighter planes decorated with "Red Stars" flying up and down, left and right, and chasing it for more than ten minutes. They opened fire with machine guns four times, but the plane was not hit. To avoid causing panic, the American pilot did not tell the passengers. So far, none of the 35 passengers are aware of the situation at the time.

[Our Correspondent, Guangzhou, 9th] An official from the Guangdong Customs recently stated regarding the Sino-Hong Kong agreement: The Sino-Hong Kong anti-smuggling agreement has been signed and is in effect, but it has not been implemented step by step because of equipment and technical problems in our country, which have nothing to do with the principles of the agreement.

### Major Cases Passed by the Executive Yuan Meeting: Postal and Telecommunications Price Adjustments Approved; Improvement of Taiwan Aluminum Industry to be Handled by the Resources Commission

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Due to soaring prices, postal and telecommunications prices are also being adjusted accordingly. The Ministry of Communications' proposed postal and telecommunications price increase plan was smoothly passed during the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting on the 9th. The postal and telecommunications price increase issue has been adjusted for the first time since disputes arose in the Legislative Yuan and the State Council last December. The result of the last dispute was that postal rates remained the same, so this time, after being passed by the Executive Yuan, it will be implemented without waiting for review by the Legislative Yuan. In addition to adjusting postal and telecommunications prices, the Ministry of Communications' proposal to the Executive Yuan also included requesting the approval of subsidy fees for last December and excess salary fees for this January.

(4) The postal and telecommunications price increase should be handled according to Option A, with ordinary letters priced at 5,000 yuan per letter and ordinary telegrams at 10,000 yuan per word. Highway freight rates can also be adjusted appropriately.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] During the routine meeting held by the Executive Yuan on the 9th, the following cases were also discussed: (1) The resolution on the cooperation agreement between the Resources Commission and the American Reynolds Metals Company to improve aluminum production in Taiwan was passed, and the Resources Commission will handle it.

Method for Clearing Up Field Taxes in Various Provinces to be Announced Soon

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] The Executive Yuan, based on the "Draft Measures for Clearing Up Field Taxes in Various Provinces" jointly submitted by the Ministries of Food, Finance, and Land Administration, convened a meeting of the three ministries for review. It was generally agreed that the accumulated problems of field taxes in China were deeply rooted and should be cleared up as soon as possible. While land registration and reorganization are the fundamental solutions for clearing up field taxes, in areas where land registration data is incomplete or where the collection of field taxes is difficult due to losses or confusion, the measures proposed by the three ministries should be followed to conduct a thorough investigation to meet urgent needs. In areas where field tax registers are complete and the collection of field taxes is not difficult, the Ministry of Land Administration will continue to handle land registration and reorganization, which will not be included in the scope of clearing up field taxes. This will allow the clearing up of field taxes and land registration to proceed separately, addressing both the symptoms and the root causes. The "Measures for Clearing Up Field Taxes in Various Provinces" originally proposed by the three ministries were passed at the political affairs meeting on the 9th and will be announced by the Executive Yuan and reported to the National Government for record.

Essay

### Prospects for the New Nanyang

— Chen Xujing

Before the outbreak of the Pacific War, Nanyang had only one independent country, Siam. When Japan occupied Nanyang, this only independent country also became a vassal state. After Japan's surrender, Siam certainly regained its autonomous status, and the Philippines and Burma also became independent one after another. Although the Netherlands has been desperately using force to suppress the people of Indonesia for more than two years, dreaming of restoring its pre-war colonial empire, the Indonesian people's spirit of perseverance and resistance to the end has shattered this dream. Therefore, even if Indonesia cannot achieve independent status in the shortest possible time, it is still on the path to autonomy.

In Annam after Japan's surrender, the independence movement led by Ho Chi Minh gained great momentum. However, for more than a year, it has been subjected to French military oppression. On the surface, the movement has suffered a major blow. However, France's defeat against Germany and its failure in resisting Japan have completely diminished its dignity. In the future, the Annamese may not be a match for France in terms of military strength, but psychologically, they have greatly changed and can no longer tolerate French rule. Recently, the French government has been making great efforts to use Bảo Đại, hoping to make him a puppet to appeal to a portion of the people and achieve its traditional policy of ruling Annam. However, are the post-war Annamese still the same as the pre-war Annamese? This kind of policy may not be easy to implement. Moreover, according to newspaper reports, the current Bảo Đại is no longer the Bảo Đại who obeyed orders in the past. For example, he opposes the separation of Cochinchina from other parts of Annam, which is also what Ho Chi Minh strongly opposes. In essence, the current Annamese not only demand an autonomous Annam, but also a unified Annam. Therefore, if the French do not thoroughly realize this and still indulge in the past military rule or the puppet policy, the result will inevitably strengthen the Annamese people's resistance.

We know that among the various ethnic groups in Nanyang, the people of Malaya probably have the weakest sense of nationalism and national consciousness. However, in the past twenty or thirty years, the constant advocacy of democracy and a unified Malaya by people like the Straits Chinese Tan Cheng Lock, as well as the anti-Japanese movement of the Malayans during the Japanese occupation, have shown that the people of Malaya are also promoting their movement for self-governance and autonomy. Recently, the establishment of the Malayan Union still shows that the British government wants to use the outdated Sultans and traditional policies to rule Malaya. However, this approach has already aroused the opposition of the Malayans. Moreover, since the British government has already granted India, and especially Ceylon and Burma, independent and autonomous status, as long as the people of Malaya work hard to promote this movement, we believe that they will surely achieve this status in the near future.

In summary, the United States' recognition of the Philippines as an independent country and Britain's recognition of India, and especially Ceylon and Burma, as autonomous entities have brought a new look to the Nanyang situation. Although the Netherlands and France are trying to maintain their colonies in Nanyang, the national self-determination movements of the Indonesians and Annamese have made the Dutch and French governments realize that it is useless to suppress these movements by force alone, and they have had to make some concessions. As for Malaya, which has always been regarded as still sleeping, it has now awakened. Nanyang, which previously had only one independent country, now has two more—the Philippines and Burma. Indonesia, Annam, and even the Malay Peninsula are all working hard to promote their independence movements. It is foreseeable that these three places will sooner or later become independent countries. The so-called hallmark of the new Nanyang is the establishment of new countries, and the so-called prospect for the new Nanyang is the realization of these new countries.

However, after the establishment of these new countries and in the process of realizing these new countries, we, from China's standpoint, have further prospects, which is the relationship between China and the new countries in Nanyang, and especially the status of overseas Chinese in these new countries in the future.

Nanyang is the center of overseas Chinese. In terms of population, overseas Chinese account for the majority in many places, such as in Siam, in the Malay Peninsula, and especially in Singapore. The Thais in Siam are not as numerous as the overseas Chinese, and the Malays in the Malay Peninsula are not as numerous as the overseas Chinese. In the total population of Singapore, overseas Chinese account for more than 70%.

In addition to this, overseas Chinese occupy a very important position in the economy of Nanyang. Commerce is almost entirely in the hands of overseas Chinese, and they also occupy a superior position in agriculture, industry, and mining. Although the Westerners in the past and the Japanese during the occupation period used various methods to curb the economic development of overseas Chinese, the economic foundation of overseas Chinese did not collapse because of this. During the Japanese occupation, the economic power of the Westerners was destroyed by the Japanese. After Japan's surrender, the economic power of the Japanese also disappeared. Although the Westerners have made a comeback, they almost completely used political power to develop their economy in the past. In the future, this power will be lost due to the independence of various ethnic groups, so their economic power will inevitably not be able to develop as it did in the past. There is no doubt about this. As for the economic power of the local people, it has always been weak and has no foundation at all. It seems impossible to compete with the overseas Chinese in a short period of time.

However, we must not forget that after various places in Nanyang become independent countries, if the political system is not democratized and political power is entirely in the hands of the local people, this will not only deprive the majority of overseas Chinese in the so-called total population of the opportunity to participate in politics, and it will also become a phenomenon of a minority controlling the majority, but it is also feared that the economic power of the overseas Chinese will be suppressed by the local people. The Thais in Siam have always used their political power to restrict the economic development of overseas Chinese. The Filipinos and even the recent Indonesians have also shown this trend. If independent Burma and future independent Annam and Malaya follow Siam's example, or even intensify their efforts, then although Nanyang in the future will be free from the shackles of colonialism and achieve autonomous status, the phenomenon of one ethnic group, or even a minority ethnic group, oppressing another ethnic group or a majority ethnic group, may be repeated. This is not only a misfortune for Nanyang, but also a misfortune for East Asia and the world!

We celebrate the independence of the Philippines and Burma, we look forward to the independence of Annam, Malaya, and Indonesia, and we especially hope that in the new countries of the new Nanyang in the future, there will be no more phenomena of one ethnic group oppressing another ethnic group, and no more policies of rulers mistreating the ruled.

### U.S. Congressman Clarkson Proposes $1.4 Billion Aid to China Bill; U.S. and China to Jointly Establish a Specialized Agency

[Central News Agency, Washington, 8th] U.S. Republican Congressman Clarkson today introduced a $1.47 billion economic and military aid to China bill in the House of Representatives. The bill is named the "China Reconstruction Act of 1948" and believes that a governmental agency should be established to specifically manage U.S.-China construction matters. This agency can control $500 million in funds and materials supplied by the U.S. Treasury Department. This agency will be organized according to the scale recommended by the Select Committee on Foreign Aid Issues in the House of Representatives and will have the power to grant or lend China urgently needed consumer and relief goods and provide financial assistance to China's reconstruction work. The proposal also requests Congress to allocate funds for military aid to China based on the principle of self-defense. The military aid plan includes supplying China with military arms and training Chinese combat troops. The proposal also requests the U.S. Treasury Department to lend China 600 million ounces of silver (calculated at a price of 70 cents per ounce in U.S. dollars) with an annual interest rate of 2%. China can repay it within 25 years with the same amount of silver or $420 million. At the same time, a five-member currency stabilization committee should be established to handle this silver and be allowed to work with an annual budget of $10 million for a five-year period. The above-mentioned governmental agency will be composed of a chairman, three committee members appointed by the U.S. President, and three committee members appointed by the Chinese government. The Chinese legal tender obtained from the Chinese side will be used to establish a construction fund to meet the needs of U.S.-China construction and post-disaster reconstruction projects.

### Disputes Over National Assembly Elections to be Decided by the Chairman

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] Regarding the election disputes after the publication of the list of elected representatives to the National Assembly, they have not yet been fully resolved. Because the Min and Qing parties, after the judicial interpretation signed and nominated by the majority of those elected, many members of the Min and Qing parties were reduced from officially elected to alternates, they raised opinions separately and disagreed with this method. The Democratic Socialist Party even submitted a written protest. It was also discussed at a meeting of the National Government's Legislative Affairs Committee on the 8th, with very enthusiastic speeches and many disputes. The Democratic Socialist Party pointed out that the Judicial Yuan could not overstep its authority and act as an interpreter of laws on behalf of the Election Headquarters. At the same time, this is a political issue and should be resolved based on political considerations. The Youth Party believes that this is a legal issue, because the supplementary regulations for the election were passed by the State Council and completed the legislative process. Therefore, when the Judicial Yuan interprets it, it should not disregard the national law. After a long discussion, it was finally decided to ask Chairman Chiang to make the final decision.

### The Subei Battle is About to Unfold, Bandit Chen Continues to Flee Southward from Shuyang, National Army Deployment Completed, Air Force Active

[Our Newspaper Huaiyin, 9th] On the eve of the great battle in northern Jiangsu, the air force began to be active in the skies over both sides' positions starting on the 8th. Also, troops stationed in Donggou and Yilin were ordered to move closer to a certain location. Nearly 100,000 people in the area are willing to have the road army withdraw.

[Our Newspaper Huaiyin, 9th] The bandits of Chen Yi's 2nd and 7th columns, about 20,000 people, who have invaded Huaiyin, fled south from Shuyang starting on the 7th and arrived on the 8th at Lirenji, Guzhai, and Liangcha, less than 100 li north of Huaiyin.

### Marshall Urges Congressional Leaders to Quickly Pass European Aid Bill, Both Houses Decide to Handle European Aid and Chinese Aid Together

[Our Newspaper News] New York 9th Broadcast: Washington News, after the Republican leaders of the House and Chairman Vandenberg of the Senate held a meeting today, they have at least temporarily rejected Secretary of State Marshall's proposal to prioritize the European Recovery Program over other foreign aid. They insisted on handling the European Recovery Program together with the $570 million in aid to China and the additional $275 million to Greece and Turkey.

[US Information Service Washington, 8th] Secretary of State Marshall personally visited House Speaker Martin today to request the House to accelerate action on the European Recovery Program bill. Eaton, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, also attended the meeting between Marshall and Martin. Afterwards, Martin told reporters that he believed that Congress's action on the European Recovery Program bill might be completed on or shortly after April 10. He hinted that this could be the final action of the State Department. Martin said that the main topic of discussion was the timetable for the European Recovery Program bill, but the issue of aid to China was also included in the conversation.

Martin said that Marshall had expressed his concern that the House's plan to include aid to China and aid to Greece and Turkey into the European Recovery Program would delay its passage. Martin said that he had assured the Secretary of State that the inclusion of these bills would accelerate the passage of the bill rather than delay it.

[US Information Service Washington, 8th] The Senate held its first recorded vote today on the various amendments to the European Recovery Program bill drafted by the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. Senator Barr proposed an amendment advocating that countries accepting European Recovery Program aid should maintain "exchange rates consistent with the actual purchasing power of the currency of those countries." The amendment was rejected by a vote of 53 to 19.

Senate Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Vandenberg opposed Barr's amendment, arguing that the term "correct exchange rate" in the original draft already provided sufficient protection. Previously, the Senate passed two amendments without objection, and Vandenberg did not object. One of the two amendments stipulated that the supply of scarce commodities to countries that do not participate in the European Recovery Program should be restricted, unless the Secretary of Commerce believes that such exports are beneficial to the country. Another amendment requires that, where possible, at least 50 percent of the goods exported under the European Recovery Program should be shipped on American ships.

### US Foreign Policy, Legislative Priority Procedures

The State Department Submits to the House Foreign Affairs Committee

The legislation that the State Department has proposed to Congress but has yet to make a final decision is listed below in accordance with the "proposed priority procedures": (1) European Recovery Program; (2) Amendment to the Aid to Greece and Turkey Act, requesting an additional $275 million; (3) Aid to China Program, totaling $570 million, for relief and construction purposes; (4) Amendment to the Temporary Aid Act, including Trieste, allocating an additional $20 million; (5) Revisions to the Reciprocal Trade Agreement; (6) Pan-American Military Cooperation Act.

### US Senators Demand Warning to the Soviet Union, Use Force if Necessary to Deter Aggression

[Associated Press Washington, 8th] The US Senate today resolved to significantly reduce the amount of American industrial goods shipped to the Soviet Union and its satellite countries. It is generally believed that this action is a direct blow to the Soviet Union. This resolution did not encounter opposition in the debate on the European Aid Program, and closely followed the demand by Senator McKellar, a Democrat from Tennessee, that the United States use military force if necessary to prevent the Communist Party from seizing more European countries. McKellar said in the Senate that the Communist Party's change in Czechoslovakia and the pressure on Finland had caused him to reserve his opposition to the European Aid Program. He said that he was a "peaceful man" and believed that the Soviet Union was preparing to wage war against the United States. McKellar also said that the Soviet Union should be warned that if the Soviet Union attempts to annex more European territory, we will help those countries maintain their integrity and independence.

### US, UK, and France Negotiating West German Issues, Soviet Union Raises Protest Again, Claims This Undermines the Potsdam Agreement

[French News Agency London, 9th] A British Foreign Office spokesman declared today that Soviet Ambassador to the UK Zarupin had submitted a note to the British government on the 6th, protesting the recent six-nation conference in London to discuss the German issue. It is believed that the British government will reject the Soviet protest note, but it is expected that London, Paris, and Washington will exchange views on this issue beforehand.

[Reuters Moscow, 8th] The Soviet government announced that it had instructed its ambassador to London on Saturday to submit a note to the British Foreign Office, stating that the Soviet government believes that the London conference's decisions on Germany cannot obtain legitimacy and international effectiveness.

[Central News Agency Moscow, 8th Associated Press] In its second protest to the United States, France, and Britain regarding their negotiations on the German issue, the Soviet Union accused the Western Allies of weakening the strength of the Allied Control Council and violating the Potsdam Agreement that stipulated the establishment of the Council of Foreign Ministers. The Soviet Union claimed that the Western Allies not only divided Germany, but also divided the entire Europe into two armed camps. The Western Allies also established the heavy industry of the Ruhr, making future German aggression possible. The protest note was delivered to the governments of the three countries by the Soviet embassies in the United States, France, and Britain. The note stated that the negotiations between the United States, Britain, and France had weakened the strength of the Allied Control Council and made it lose its meaning. The meeting held by the United States, Britain, and France in London on the German issue has clearly indicated that the current issue is not only about the invalidation of the agreements obtained by the Allied Control Council on Germany, but also about the invalidation of the Potsdam Agreement of the Council of Foreign Ministers. The Soviet note did not elaborate on this statement or imply any actions the Soviet Union might take in the future. It is rumored that the Soviet Union may attempt to change the status of the Allied Control Council or change the current situation in Berlin, which is divided into four Allied occupation zones. However, the note did not provide any support for these rumors.

[Reuters Washington, In addition to the fact that the delegation also includes a number of other members, the delegation is expected to arrive in Washington, D.C. for a visit. The American Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Douglas, who participated in the German problem meeting in London, returned to Washington yesterday to submit a meeting report and continue its mission on the European Recovery Program.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 8th] The "Third Force" (a group of parties between the left and right wings led by Schuman) today issued a press release to the media, severely criticizing General De Gaulle's speech in Compiègne yesterday. It stated, "The French People's Rally" (led by De Gaulle) just like the Communist Party, claims that the struggle against the enemy is solely their achievement. It should be known that this war of resistance is not the achievement of one person or one party alone, but the common achievement of France. The press release criticized De Gaulle for using a deceptive policy to exhaust the nation's enthusiasm, and then stated that the government's current activities are to deal with these most immoral political agitators. The government is currently pursuing a policy in domestic and international plans that neither contains the meaning of war preparation nor reduces reliance on any choice. At this moment, a voice is suddenly heard opposing the government's efforts, attempting to dissolve it and carry out a divisive election campaign, then the danger of civil war and the worst oppressive attempts will follow. The press release concluded that only unity can bring together the free and sound forces of the country, this unity is aimed at opposing those who destroy freedom and the moral character of democratic rights.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] The Communist Party's organ, "L'Humanité" this morning, criticized De Gaulle's speech, pointing out that it was purely against the most direct interests of France.

### Truman and MacArthur Express Willingness to Participate in Presidential Election Japanese Are Concerned About MacArthur's Successor

[United Press, Washington, 8th] President Truman announced today through the chairman of the Democratic National Committee that if he is nominated by the convention, he will participate in the presidential election. The President also announced that his civic position will not change due to the opposition of Democrats in the southern states. Some Southern Democrats openly hope that Truman will withdraw from the presidential race because they are dissatisfied with the President's bills submitted to Congress to abolish lynching and prohibit discrimination against blacks.

[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] Allied Commander MacArthur stated on the 9th that if he is nominated as a presidential candidate, he is willing to return to the country to run for election.

[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] MacArthur issued a statement today in response to a petition from his fellow citizens in Wisconsin, saying that he does not intend to actively participate in the presidential election, but hinted that if he is called upon by the American people, he can accept. MacArthur said, "I am deeply grateful for the joint invitation from my fellow citizens to participate in the election. At this critical moment at home and abroad, this kind of public movement should move anyone in the heart. I have no intention of seeking office, nor do I intend to leave my current position, but if I retreat in the face of difficulties, and do not have the courage to accept any public office called upon by the American people, then I will violate all the concepts of a good citizen that I have always believed in."

[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] Japanese newspapers all issued extra editions, and industrial stocks immediately rose. The current problem in Japan is when MacArthur will leave Japan and who will be his successor. The Japanese also began to ask what impact the presidential election in the United States will have on aid to Japan. MacArthur is currently 68 years old and in excellent health in winter, and has never suffered a major illness since coming to Japan.

[United Press, Washington, 9th] If MacArthur is nominated as a candidate, the highest-ranking person to succeed as commander-in-chief of the garrison in Japan is probably Lieutenant General Eichelberger, commander of the Eighth Army. Last autumn, Eichelberger returned to the United States to report on his duties, and the Department of the Army discussed this possibility.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 9th] Leading figures from all walks of life in Japan are quite anxious about what the future of Japan will be if MacArthur were to leave. MacArthur clearly stated last year that he would stay in Japan until the occupation goals were completed. If he is elected president, he can also point out that the occupation goals have at least been completed in the following areas: (1) The reparations issue has come to an end; (2) Japan has been democratized; (3) A peaceful situation has been established in Japan; (4) Foreign trade has also recovered; (5) The Japanese government has been given autonomy, Japan may obtain peace without a peace treaty, and MacArthur will enter the White House. However, MacArthur's move from Tokyo to the White House is still a long way off.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 9th] A senior official of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs told Agence France-Presse on the afternoon of the 9th: "Japan without MacArthur is like Japan without an Emperor." He said, "We cannot currently know who can replace MacArthur in effectively resisting the pressure on the US regarding the occupation policy of Japan, mainly the pressure from the Soviet Union, because we do not want any changes to the occupation policy of Japan, we only want the United States to handle Japanese affairs." The official insisted that his name not be disclosed.

The Friendly Response in Washington is Extremely Good

[United Press, Washington, 9th] Marshal MacArthur issued a statement saying that if called upon, he is willing to accept the position of president. Those in Washington who support MacArthur's election received this news today and were very enthusiastic. However, the reactions from all sides were quite different. Howard, the national chairman of the MacArthur for President Club, said that if MacArthur is elected president, he can stop communism. Democratic Senator Daniel said that MacArthur's statement gave hope to the desperate world. Republican Congressman Miller said that MacArthur's statement is the green light that the American people have been hoping for.

### MacArthur's Election Would Be the Best News for China

MacArthur Told Zhu Shuming

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] What can be announced at present is that MacArthur, when answering a question about what would happen in the Far East if he were elected President of the United States, told a senior representative of our government: "This would be the best news for President Chiang." This conversation took place two months ago when Zhu Shuming, the former head of our country's delegation to Japan, asked MacArthur when he passed through Tokyo from Washington on his way back to China.

If MacArthur Participates in the Election, There Will Be Personnel Changes in the Allied Headquarters

Japanese Predict Changes in Policy Toward Japan

[This Newspaper] New York, 9th Broadcast: Tokyo News, Japanese political circles are already predicting that if MacArthur is nominated as a presidential candidate, some major changes may occur in the Allied Headquarters. They believe that MacArthur may lead some close confidants back to the United States, and personnel changes may lead to policy changes. Some people believe that MacArthur's election as president would be beneficial to the Far East, because MacArthur has extensive knowledge of the Far East issue and will definitely give greater importance to this part of the world.

### Japanese War Criminal Denies Invading China and Makes Counter-Propaganda in Court

Defense Statement Has Been Deleted Three Times

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] This morning, when the lawyers for Tojo and the other 24 war criminals began their defense in the international court on the Chinese stage of their crimes, the wartime propaganda of Japan's invasion of China was revived. The defendant's defense statement accused Chinese troops of firing at Japanese troops at the Lugou Bridge in China, China sought employment from Japan, and Japan had no choice but to take equal measures due to the pressure caused by its increasing population. Japan only fought with anti-Japanese troops, but did not fight with the Chinese people. This 95-page defense statement by the defendant's lawyers, due to the court's order, had the insulting words thoroughly deleted three times, totaling 13 pages.

### The World's Fattest Woman Weighs 750 Pounds

### The Current Strength of the British Navy is Second Only to the United States in Terms of Quantity, but Still Ranks First in the World in Terms of Effectiveness

[Reuters, London, 8th] The naval budget debate was held in the House of Commons today. In response to criticisms from all parties regarding the reduction of the strength of the British fleet, the Financial Secretary of the Admiralty, Duhel, emphasized that the strength of the British fleet, in terms of quantity, is second only to the United States in the world; in terms of effectiveness, it ranks first in the world. If a modern war occurs within the next fifty years, the performance of the British fleet will not be worse than any country in the world.

Except for the number of battleships, which is less than before the war, the number of warships of every other class is the same as the average number each year before the war. By December this year, the British Navy will have four battleships, three fleet aircraft carriers, five light aircraft carriers, seventeen cruisers, thirty-four submarines, fifty-two destroyers, and forty-three escort ships in active service. Duhel specifically mentioned the improvement in the effectiveness of destroyers, saying that the 24 newest British destroyers are already comparable in effectiveness to the light cruisers before the war. Duhel continued, the naval budget for the next fiscal year is 153 million pounds, a decrease of 43.7 million pounds compared to this year, of which 9 million pounds are for use, especially paying attention to the impact of the atomic bomb on the navy. Duhel also revealed that submarines will now be equipped with "snorkel tubes" to increase their underwater endurance. For example, the British submarine "Alliance" is capable of diving 3,000 miles because it is equipped with this equipment. In addition, it is planned to improve the submarine's propulsion engine. If the principle of jet propulsion can be applied to ships and boats in the sea, it will revolutionize the entire naval tactics and commercial navigation. Currently, this research is still in its infancy. Duhel further stated that the fleets of the British Commonwealth are all expanding, so the British Navy is not isolated and is not solely responsible for the defense of the British Commonwealth. In the colonies, Malaya has decided to build a permanent fleet of its own, and other colonies will follow suit. Earlier, opposition leader Churchill criticized the government's measures to reduce the fleet, saying that the fact that the domestic fleet only has one cruiser and four destroyers is a shocking move for the free and democratic countries of the world. It is no wonder that Argentina, Chile, and Guatemala are all provoking England. He also advocated that the five battleships currently being dismantled should be retained, because these warships can still serve as armored bases for launching rockets.

### British Government Releases White Paper Reporting on Economic Situation

[This Newspaper] London, 9th Broadcast: The British government released a white paper today, which predicts that even with the aid under the Marshall Plan, the food and clothing available to the British people in 1948 will still be reduced. According to this document, which was released by Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps and is 30,000 words long, due to the increasing "saturation point" of foreign markets, the United Kingdom's export target for 1948 had to be reduced by 10 percent, and the number of unemployed will increase from 300,000 at the end of last year to 500,000. This June, the United Kingdom will again withdraw 200 million pounds (888 million US dollars) from its 680 million pounds (2.72 billion US dollars) of gold and dollar reserves to meet various important expenditures.

### Western European Five-Nation Alliance Treaty Can Be Drafted Today No Agreement Reached on Extending to Territories of Participating Countries

[Reuters, Brussels, 9th] The first seven articles of the draft treaty of the Western European Alliance are expected to be finally approved at the meeting on the 9th. The full text of the draft is expected to be completed tomorrow. The seven articles were passed by the plenary session of the five countries yesterday, and the drafting committee composed of legal experts from the five countries has drafted the final form. No full agreement has been reached on extending automatic mutual assistance to the territories of participating countries. An official frankly admitted that this issue is complex and novel and cannot be easily handled.

### Representatives of the Four Powers, China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, Begin to Discuss the Situation in the Holy Land China Will Reiterate Its Opposition to Partition

### New Prices for Water, Electricity, Gas, and Telephone Approved and Effective Today Increased by 20% to 40% Respectively

[This Newspaper] The prices of public utilities such as tap water, electricity, gas, and telephone in the city will be significantly adjusted starting from the 10th of this month. The new prices will increase by 20% to 40% respectively. The Mayor approved it yesterday. The new prices for March are recorded below:

Water Price (per cubic meter)

Inland, Zhabei, and Pudong Three Companies 17,200 yuan (originally 12,700 yuan)

British and French Two Companies 13,000 yuan (originally 10,000 yuan)

Electricity Price (per kilowatt-hour)

Shanghai Electric Power Company (Electricity) 12,000 yuan (originally 8,515 yuan) (Power) 10,300 yuan (originally 7,740 yuan)

French Water and Electricity Company (Electricity) 13,500 yuan (originally 9,800 yuan) (Power) 11,400 yuan (originally 8,900 yuan)

### Disputes Between Both Sides Repeated Reductions

The Public Utilities Bureau invited representatives from the Municipal Council, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, and various companies yesterday morning to jointly review the prices. During the meeting, representatives from the council and the Public Utilities Bureau disputed fiercely with the representatives of the companies because the new prices requested by the companies were too high, which would affect the burden on citizens. After repeated reductions, the final decision was made as above, which is much different from the prices requested by the companies. According to reports, the cost of living index has increased by 59%, fuel has increased by 50%, and the exchange rate has been adjusted repeatedly, resulting in a significant increase in the cost of various companies.

### Gas Penalties Difficult to Cancel Temporarily

The excess gas penalty was also discussed. It was originally intended to be reduced, but because this penalty is one of the company's income, if it is cancelled, the cost of each degree of gas will be more than 60,000 yuan, which will increase the burden on small users. Therefore, it was decided to temporarily maintain the status quo and consider it after prices have stabilized slightly. According to Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, the rumor that the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Company jointly requested a price increase of 100% is not based on fact. The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau was invited by the Municipal Government to jointly review the prices, and the Shanghai Telephone Company's request was by no means as high as 100%.

### Various Subcommittees of the Council Will Hold Reorganization Soon

Various subcommittees of the Municipal Council will hold reorganization soon. The secretariat of the council issued a notice yesterday, asking councilors to register for the various subcommittees they wish to participate in before the 20th of this month.

It is reported that the vacancy left by Wu will be filled by Zhu Bulan, the first alternate councilor in the district.

### The Remains of the Late Legislator Ye Qiuyuan Will Be Buried Tomorrow

The fire was extinguished after about one and a half hours after the Central Fire Department and the Yichang Road Huachulu Branch and the Caojiadu Fire Brigade rushed to the scene. It is estimated that eight or nine houses were burned down, and the losses cannot be estimated for the time being. The Jiangning Police Station is currently investigating the case overnight.

The Xinfu Kerosene Factory at No. 1, Catholic Church Street, Puyi West Road, Guohuo Road, Nanshi, caught fire at about 5:50 pm yesterday due to the careless refining of kerosene with diesel oil. The fire brigades of the East, South, West, North, and Central districts of Nanshi drove to the scene to put out the fire, but unfortunately, once the diesel and kerosene came into contact with water, they exploded in all directions, so the firefighters could only use long leather hoses to draw water and shoot from a distance, and it took about an hour to extinguish the fire. It is reported that the kerosene factory has been completely burned down. A large amount of kerosene, along with the factory foundation, machinery, and equipment, has been lost, and the detailed situation is being investigated by the Fenglai Police Station. When the fire was raging, the manager of the factory, Zhou Hanqing (50 years old, from Chaozhou), was burned on his limbs and was later sent to the police hospital for treatment by the police station. After receiving the report, the Zhongqu Fire Brigade in the city, led by Director Jing Hexiang, personally led volunteer firefighters to the scene in a fire truck. When they were passing the west end of the Old Drill Ground, they collided with a medium-sized Executive Yuan jeep with license plate number 040715. At that time, the fire truck driver blew the alarm horn after seeing the jeep, but the driver of the jeep ignored it and continued to rush forward. The fire truck was forced to drive onto the sidewalk, but was still hit by the jeep, damaging the fender and fire-fighting equipment. Firefighter Shao Liang's left foot was injured in the collision and was later sent to the Municipal Second Hospital for treatment. The Executive Yuan driver who caused the accident was taken to the Penglai Police Station by the police on duty for investigation.

In addition, a fire broke out at No. 3, Lane 85, Daxing Street, Nanshi, at about 0:50 pm yesterday, but fortunately, the Xiqu Fire Brigade was nearby and rushed to the scene to put out the fire.

### The Dance Industry Files an Administrative Appeal, and the Social Affairs Bureau also Files a Response

After the dance disturbance case occurred last month, the Social Affairs Bureau ordered the dissolution of the Dance Hall Industry Association, and transferred Sun Hongyuan, the chairman of the association, to the District Prosecutor's Office for prosecution on suspicion of instigating the destruction of the Social Affairs Bureau. The industry association believed that this measure by the Social Affairs Bureau was illegal, and has hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to file an administrative appeal to the Municipal Government, arguing that the association did not participate in the destruction during the previous dance disturbance, which was manipulated by a small number of traitors and unscrupulous elements, and the association was unable to stop it. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau's dissolution of the association was inappropriate. After the appeal was filed, the Social Affairs Bureau, based on the Administrative Appeal Law, filed a response to the Municipal Government the other afternoon, stating in general terms that: According to the photos taken when the Bureau was destroyed, the banners of the dance halls petitioning, and the identity documents and labels left by the dancers and staff on the open space, it is sufficient to prove that the responsible members of the Dance Industry Association, the dance industry capitalists, were all present at the time and were in an active position. Therefore, the responsibility of the association for disrupting public order and wantonly engaging in destruction cannot be shirked. The Social Affairs Bureau, in accordance with Article 18 of the People's Organization Law: "If a people's organization violates laws and regulations, endangers public interests, or is negligent in its duties, it may be subject to the following sanctions: (1) Warning, (2) Removal of responsible persons, (3) Reorganization, (4) Dissolution," and dissolved it, which cannot be considered an improper handling. It is reported that the Municipal Government will decide on this case in writing.

### Using the Name of the Port Affairs Association to Fraudulently Obtain a Huge Sum of Money from a Merchant; Falling into a Trap When Purchasing Diesel; Four Criminals Arrested and Transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for Interrogation

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Port Affairs Association's Investigation and Guard Group sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday, stating that Wu Borong and others had extorted money from merchant Zhang Yaonian and requested that it be investigated according to law. Broker Wu Borong sold 50 tons of diesel oil to Zhang Yaonian at the Rongtian Tea House on the 26th of last month, at a price of 13 million yuan per ton. Later, Zhang resold it to the Shen Su Xi Transportation Company, and it was agreed that the goods would be delivered on March 3rd. Zhang paid Wu a check for 240 million yuan, and Dai Ronggui of the Detai Foundry issued a guarantee letter, responsible for collecting the money and delivering the goods. Wu repeatedly delayed the delivery date, and later agreed to prepare a ship to collect the goods on the 4th of this month. When the time came, Wu called Zhang and said that the goods had been detained by the Shanghai Port Affairs Association's Investigation and Guard Group because the origin was unknown, and told Zhang to avoid it temporarily. Then, Chi Antai, together with someone in uniform who claimed to be from the Port Affairs Association, went to Zhang's house and threatened to arrest people. On the afternoon of the 4th, Dai Ronggui asked Zhang to discuss the matter at the Nanguo Restaurant the next morning. Dai Ronggui told Zhang that the Port Affairs Association's Investigation and Guard Group needed 30 million yuan to settle the matter. At 5:00 pm on the 5th, Zhang paid a check for 30 million yuan from the Dunxu Bank to a person named Mei Zhenyuan at the Dongya Cafe. Because Zhang had not received the diesel oil and was extorted, he reported the incident to the Port Affairs Association's Investigation and Guard Group.

After being interrogated by Prosecutor Liang Gengwu, Wu and others confessed to conspiring to extort money. As a result, Wu was detained, and Dai and Mei each paid a 500 million yuan written guarantee, and Yang was required to provide a 500 million yuan written guarantee plus two reliable shop guarantees in addition to his own written guarantee.

Feng Guangyao, the branch director, ordered Section Chief Shen Zuoluo to lead section members Cheng Wengui, police officer Li Canyin, and others to the scene, where they arrested the suspect Xu and brought him to the station for interrogation. He claimed to be 51 years old, from Ningbo, residing at 55 Madang Road, and denied the allegations. The branch bureau transferred him to the court for prosecution on charges of special criminal offenses of internal rebellion and extortion.

### The Whole Story of the Conflict Between Students and Military Police in Lanzhou: Not a Student Uprising

[Airmail report from our newspaper, Lanzhou, 4th] On the second day of Farmers' Day (February 25th) evening, four students from Lanzhou University, Wang Shuangke, Wei Zhanshu, Geng Gongshun, and Tian Fenghou, had a conflict with a few military police officers from the 22nd Regiment in front of the Jingcheng Theater. At that time, the students seized the insignia of a certain military police officer. Later, after mediation, both sides shook hands and made peace, and the insignia was returned to the military police officer. The students and others returned to the school. Both parties agreed to keep it a secret to avoid being punished by superiors and teachers.

Mr. Duan Zimei, the director of student affairs at Lanzhou University, recounted the situation of that night to the reporter: At about 11 o'clock that night, after the four returned, Wang Shuangke vomited blood. After persistent questioning by his classmates, he revealed that he had been beaten by the military police with the butt of a pistol. His injuries appeared to be serious. The classmates immediately took Wang Shuangke to the Guanzhou Central Hospital in Lanzhou for treatment that night. The students who stayed at the school during the winter vacation were filled with righteous indignation upon hearing of this bloody incident and decided to go to the provincial government and the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters the next morning to petition. After learning of this, the school dissuaded the students after they gathered in the morning around 7 AM, but to no avail as the emotions were too high. However, two counselors were sent along to take care of them.

Before departure, Huang Kesong, a senior student from the banking department of Lanzhou University, telephoned Director Zhang Zhizhong of the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters. The student team numbered over a hundred, shouting slogans along the way and writing slogans on the streets with chalk. The reporter witnessed slogans such as "Down with the murderous military police" and "Protect human rights, uphold the constitution." Following the student team were nearly a hundred onlookers, but the order was still good. The military and police along the way were ordered not to stop them, so there were no other incidents.

The team first went to the provincial government, but Secretary-General Ding was not there, so they went directly to the Northwest Commander-in-Chief's headquarters. Shangguan Yeyou, the director of the press office, received the three student representatives on behalf of Director Zhang. The students put forward four demands: (1) Replace Cao Shubu, the commander of the 22nd Military Police Regiment; (2) Execute the military police involved in the incident; (3) Issue an apology in the newspaper; (4) The 22nd Military Police Regiment should bear full responsibility for the incident and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. Director Shangguan immediately promised to investigate the truth of the incident and handle it strictly according to the law. The truth of the incident, at that time, each side had its own version. The students said that the military police were beating a farmer, and their four classmates mediated out of righteousness. Unexpectedly, the military police became angry and violently beat the four classmates, knocking three of them to the ground. Wang Shuangke was the most seriously injured. The military police said that the students had no tickets to see the play and first had a quarrel with the military police. Then, three students snatched and tore the insignia. The military police fought back in self-defense, but there were no serious injuries. They were puzzled by the serious injury of student Wang Shuangke.

On the afternoon of the 26th, Director Shangguan, Mayor Sun, Military Police Regiment Commander Cao, and people from all walks of life went to the Central Hospital to comfort Wang Shuangke. At 5:00 PM, Director Shangguan hosted reporters and made the following remarks on the conflict between students and military police:

"The Northwest is currently in a most stable and progressive state. Lanzhou University is the highest institution of higher learning in the Northwest. The academic atmosphere is usually good, and it gets along well with the military and political circles. Unexpectedly, yesterday in this city at the Jingcheng Theatre, a few military police and a few students from Lanzhou University had a conflict. The authorities of the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters attach great importance to the occurrence of this unfortunate incident. This headquarters has always been very concerned about the difficulties in Lanzhou University's school affairs and the lives of the students. The director and deputy director of this headquarters especially care for and promote the young students as if they were their own children. This incident will definitely be dealt with strictly according to the law. However, the truth is still under detailed investigation. According to the statements of the students and the military police, the causes of the incident differ, but regardless of the facts, all the military police who were present at the time have been escorted to the military law office of this headquarters for interrogation. Once the truth is found out, there will be a fair and appropriate handling. This headquarters will never be lenient in the slightest. As for the students who were beaten and injured, they have been sent to the Central Hospital for treatment. This afternoon, I went to visit and comfort them on behalf of the director and deputy director, and I also asked the hospital to take good care of them and hope that their injuries will recover and that they will be discharged from the hospital as soon as possible. In short, this matter is just an accidental conflict involving a few people. I sincerely hope that the students of Lanzhou University will uphold their excellent tradition, calm their emotions, and wait patiently for the reasonable and legal handling of this headquarters."

That evening, the students of Lanzhou University felt that the original three representatives had lost their qualifications as of 5:00 PM that afternoon. In order to strive for the realization of their demands, they reorganized the "Lanzhou University 2.25 Tragedy Support Association" and elected an eight-member presidium, and mutually elected Xue Yunhe, a freshman in the history department, as chairman.

At around 5:00 AM on the 27th, the First Police Precinct discovered six people posting reactionary slogans on Lizhi Road and arrested only one of them, named Wei Yanling, 15 years old, from Xianyang. He was hired for 100,000 yuan to post these slogans, and he knew nothing else because he was illiterate and did not know the harm of these slogans. Director Shangguan was reminded of the communist party's use of opportunities to achieve the goal of "three strikes and one tragedy," so he made another speech, the main idea of which was to expose the conspiracy of the traitors and to hope that the students of Lanzhou University would not be fooled. That day, after the students of Lanzhou University learned about the posting of reactionary slogans, they dared not post the dozens of slogans they had originally written, lest they be confused and cause misunderstanding among the community. At the same time, the students themselves organized a disciplinary team.

Tightened security to prevent gangsters from mixing into the school to create incidents and expand the situation.

At this time, the city of Lanzhou had become a world of rumors, but the students of other schools and the people in the community were all calm. In addition to the military police staying indoors and holding their posts unarmed, the students of national universities all sent representatives to comfort the injured students and advised the students of Lanzhou University to proceed with caution to avoid unnecessary complications.

On the 28th, Cai Yadong, the deputy director of the Northwest Commander-in-Chief's military law office, who was hearing the case, told the reporter that after the case occurred, the military police regiment escorted the offending military police officers Liang Hongtai and others to the office on the afternoon of the 26th. They subpoenaed the victims and the theater staff overnight, and interrogated and investigated them on the morning of the 27th. ... Regardless of the cause, there seems to be no doubt that the military police beat the students. When the injured student Wang Shuangke recovers, he will be interrogated in bed and the final injuries will be diagnosed by the hospital before being handed over for trial.

At noon on the 23rd, the reporter went to Lanzhou University to visit the school authorities and listen to the opinions of the student representatives. Mr. Duan Zimei, the director of student affairs, and Mr. Dong Shuangqiu, the dean of the law school, both stated that the school has always been able to minimize the impact of large events. After two or three days of calm consideration, the students felt that the situation was not too serious. The school authorities hoped to resolve the incident quickly within the scope of the law.

Then, the reporter and several other colleagues went to student representative Xue Yunhe, who said: "We came to study, not to cause trouble. Regarding the facts, we have asked the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters to investigate. We only hope that our classmates will recover soon. We believe that the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters can definitely give us a fair resolution to this matter." He continued, "Unfortunately, the outside world does not understand the truth, and there are many people who slander us. Some people even view us from the perspective of a student movement. This is just an accidental event. Our motives are very pure and very frank. All our actions are to be in accordance with the law. We guarantee that there are no improper purposes and no rebellious intentions. All our meeting records can be absolutely open to anyone."

"If any of your four requirements are in conflict with the law, what will you do?" Xue replied, "Regarding the support association, we have cancelled it informally. We only use the names 'Lanzhou University Students' and 'student representatives' to the outside world. As for the four requirements, we will abide by the law."

At 10:00 AM that morning, Deputy Director Cai Yadong and Police Officer Zhan went to the Central Hospital to interrogate Wang Shuangke. Wang was in excellent spirits, and the investigation procedure was completed. At 2:30 PM, Lanzhou University representative Xue Yunhe and others visited Director Shangguan again and expressed that the motives of the Lanzhou University students were pure, and they did not want the incident to escalate. They were waiting for the Commander-in-Chief's fair decision. However, they expressed their deep hatred for the fact that traitors were taking advantage of the situation and posting reactionary slogans, resulting in the confusion of truth and falsehood and the reversal of right and wrong. Director Shangguan sincerely made three points: (1) Obey the decision of the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters, (2) Guard against the use of traitors, (3) Maintain the reputation of Lanzhou University. The student representatives readily agreed. After this statement by the Lanzhou University representatives, all the rumors were dispelled. At 9:30 AM on the 3rd, the collegiate panel of the Commander-in-Chief's military law office was chaired by Deputy Director Cai Yadong, and the judges were Mu Chunren and Yuan Xusong. More than 30 people from the provincial government, the military police regiment, and the faculty and students of Lanzhou University attended the hearing. After deliberation, the verdict was announced, and its main text was: "Cui Delin, Gao Ximing, and Li Fengxiang (Note: all military police) jointly injured the bodies of others. Cui Delin is sentenced to three years of imprisonment, and Gao Xiyun and Li Fengxiang are each sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment." The court adjourned at about 12:00 noon. Then, Director Shangguan represented the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters in hosting reporters and faculty and student representatives from Lanzhou University, and made an important explanation on the case, stating in brief: This case was based on the diagnosis issued by the Central Hospital, which determined the facts and imposed the sentence. According to the diagnosis, it was determined to be an ordinary injury, the maximum sentence for which is three years, so the maximum sentence was imposed. However, according to Article 44 of the Military, Naval, and Air Force Trial Law, if new circumstances occur after the sentence is pronounced, a retrial may still be applied for. As for the administrative punishment, the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters believes that the relevant direct superiors of the military police regiment in this case should be held responsible for lax discipline. Regiment Commander Cao Shuxi received one demerit, Company Commander Wang Ruixiao received one major demerit, Platoon Leader Zhang Bida was demoted, and Squad Leader Liang Hongtai was confined for one month. Regarding medical compensation and other matters, the military police regiment will bear the costs of Wang Shuangke's hospital medication and food. The Commander-in-Chief's headquarters will also provide appropriate recuperation fees to Wang Shuangke and Wei Zhanshu to show care and sympathy for their health. Finally, Director Shangguan solemnly pointed out: This case focuses on rectifying military discipline and rectifying the school spirit. The decision is reasonable and legal. It is hoped that the students and the military police will understand each other and be reconciled, without any grudges. It is hoped that the Lanzhou University will follow the Ministry of Education's order to rectify the school spirit, encourage the students to maintain their excellent traditions, and establish a good model for university students. It is also hoped that the military police will humbly reflect on themselves, work harder, and maintain the honor of the military police. Then, Professor Guo Weiping, the secretary-general of Lanzhou University, represented all the faculty and students, expressing their deep satisfaction with the fair, just, reasonable and legal handling of the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters. He also expressed his gratitude and apologized to the military police regiment, hoping that they would understand each other. Finally, the representative of the military police regiment expressed that soldiers take obedience to orders as their duty and will absolutely accept and fulfill their responsibilities.

This disturbance has come to an end. Thanks to the proper handling by the local authorities, the situation did not escalate, and the traitors felt that the great opportunity had passed in an instant. (Reported by our reporter Song Lin)

### Travel Notes in Shanxi (5): Liquidation, Military Expansion, and Three Investigations

[Airmail report from our newspaper, Taiyuan, 2nd] There are indeed many loyal and astute cadres around General Yan Xishan who have been planning new policies for decades. Liang Huazhi, the secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee, is one of them. He has twenty years of experience in fighting the Communists. Although the great mutiny of the 50th regiment of new recruits of the "Sacrifice to Save the Country Alliance" in southeastern Shanxi in 1939 was a fatal blow to Liang, and perhaps also to General Yan, it was also a lesson that raised their vigilance even higher over the past ten years. The Communist bandits regard Liang Huazhi as a very troublesome figure. One day, he brought two Communist bandits who had surrendered to meet with the reporter. He said: "Ask them, and you will know everything."

Liquidation and Military Expansion: Yang Xianzhi, 27 years old, joined the "Eighth Route Army" in all innocence when Shanxi fell at the age of seventeen. Today, he is already a "regimental political commissar" who decides the strategic route of the country. Zhang Jian, the deputy director of the Communist Wenxi County Public Security Bureau, is even younger, only 24 years old. He was sent to Taiyuan as a role of "breaking in, standing firm, climbing up, and waiting for orders," but was captured. Neither of them understood the theory of communism, but they had a very fluent formula of slogans and new terms, which are the two poor young people under the consistent strategy of the Communist bandits, "the people can be made to follow, but not to know."

Zhang Jian had actually participated in "struggle liquidation" and the execution of "land reform." Initially, the targets of the struggle were the "three capitalists" - those with capital, reputation, and qualifications. However, in the vast old and traditional countryside, few were willing to bury their rationality and do this kind of thing. Therefore, they mobilized local ruffians and organized "poor peasant associations" to settle old scores, using unscrupulous and inhumane "twenty-four tortures and thirty-six killings" red terror policies to subdue the people. After the liquidation, gold, silver, and treasures filled the "public treasury." Land could not be moved, so it was said to be the people's "liquidation fruits" and divided up. Soon, the slogan of "protecting the fruits" was put forward, requiring the people to arm themselves and be organized into "transport teams" for a moment, then "backbone teams," then "detachment," "new team" ... Then they went to the front line to fill the gunports. All the way liquidation, all the way to expand the military. The Communist bandits strictly blockaded thought and monitored actions. Once trapped, no one could escape. According to Zhang himself: "At the beginning of the struggle, they wanted me to lead the masses to smash a seventy-year-old man to death with stones. I really trembled." "What did you feel at this time?" I asked nicely. He said shyly: "The Communist Party said that my capitalist consciousness had not been cleaned up yet." Therefore, the Communist bandits carried out a "tear off face struggle" and forced people to act like beasts to kill their own fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, and sisters. Anyone who hesitated was subject to the "three investigations" - investigating three generations of history, investigating composition, and investigating the standpoint below the target of killing without mercy.

The Death of Niu Yinkuan: Niu Yinkuan, a graduate of Tsinghua University and the most active Communist "Jin Sui Administrative Office" deputy director in the "December 9th" student movement in Beiping, is an example. Niu's father, Niu Youlan, was a large landlord in Xing County. During the Anti-Japanese War, he destroyed his family to relieve the national crisis, supplying more than 10,000 people in the Communist army's Provisional First Division and other units with food and winter clothing, and he donated land to establish schools. The Communist Party praised him as an "enlightened landlord" and "revolutionary family," but after the "three investigations," Niu Youlan was "struggled against" and Niu Yinkuan was called to lead this "struggle." The seventy-five-year-old Niu Youlan was tortured so much that his flesh was mangled, and bamboo skewers were inserted into his ten fingernails. The "masses" also clamored and forced Niu Yinkuan to slap his father in the face. Niu Youlan died tragically, and Niu Yinkuan hanged himself, but the Communist Party still said that he was "feudal, selfish, and an unrevolutionary reactionary." For thousands of years, China's moral concepts have now launched a bayonet fight with the Communist bandits.

Creating Deadly Enemies: After the landlords were liquidated, some who were not killed had their families detained in the "Public Security Section," found good social connections for them, and sent them to this side to do intelligence work. If they did not go, they would die. If they went and leaked secrets, the whole family would be killed. If they were executed on this side, it would fulfill the Communist bandits' plan to "borrow a knife to kill." Liang Huazhi said: "Everyone who can escape from the hands of the Communist bandits is doing intelligence work, but none of them are truly Communist Party members." Shanxi Province's Three Hundreds Movement is a way to find out these disguised countermeasures. More than 10,000 people were discovered in Taiyuan. In Yuci County, out of 150,000 people, there were more than 600 Communist Party members, 105 underground tunnels, and nearly 10,000 people committing crimes.

During the Zhili-Fengtian War, the people of Shijiazhuang did not have time to hang flags to welcome the soldiers. When this army came and that army left, they simply hung a flag that said "Welcome Dear Army". Liang Huazhi firmly said: "Today's suppression of the rebellion cannot allow this situation to exist. We can only make the people and the Communist bandits deadly enemies, vowing to never coexist, clearly and strictly dividing the country and the enemies of the country, so that we can thoroughly defeat the Communist bandits."

Haining Huanggang: Suspected Wife Murder Case; Local Prosecutor's Office Sends Personnel to Examine Body [Our Newspaper, Haining, 8th] A resident surnamed Shen in Shenjia Courtyard, Zhoujia Tai Bridge, Huanggang Township, Haining County, does not engage in honest work and is addicted to gambling. The day before yesterday late at night, after losing money and returning home, he argued with his wife and then beat her, after which there was no sound. Unexpectedly, the next day, Shen urgently reported to his neighbors that his wife had died suddenly of a heart attack last night and presented a written statement signed by both parties. The neighbors, because his wife had never been ill, wondered how she could die overnight, and doubted the story. When they went to his house to offer condolences, they discovered a rope mark around the deceased's neck, which aroused suspicion. Upon hearing the news, the Township Office and the Police Station dispatched personnel to investigate. Shen had purchased a large number of new clothes to dress the body for burial. The local prosecutor's office suspects that this case involves a husband possibly inciting or committing murder and has decided to send personnel to examine the body on the 9th to clarify the truth.

The Mystery of the Murder of Deng Meikui, Farmers' Leader in Yiyang [Our Newspaper, Changsha, 7th Dispatch] Deng Meikui, the executive director of the Yiyang Zhenyan Township Farmers' Association, was murdered on the 2nd of last month. The news has attracted attention from all parties. Especially at a time when the "Two-Five Rent Reduction" movement is being promoted, Deng's death is undoubtedly related to his leadership of local farmers in the rent reduction movement before his death. Therefore, Liu Xiru, Director of the Department of Social Affairs, and Xiao Xun, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, are paying more attention to Deng's murder case. Currently, Jiang Chengpeng, the inspector dispatched by the Department of Social Affairs to investigate this case, has returned to Changsha. He has not yet given a definitive answer regarding the cause of death. Director Liu and Director Xiao are preparing to go together to investigate in person to uncover the truth.

Ascending to the Leader's Throne Deng Meikui was from Dengshiqiao, Yiyang. For generations, his family had farmed the land, but by Deng's time, he no longer farmed but opened a butcher shop. Due to his business, he knew many nearby farmers. In October of the year before last (1946), the government issued the "Two-Five Rent Reduction" decree. The County Farmers' Association posted a notice about the rent reduction on the wall next to Deng's butcher's table. Every day, farmers who came to buy meat asked Deng to read it to them. These farmers were overjoyed and insisted that Deng inquire at the County Farmers' Association when he went to town. After inquiring several times, it was confirmed to be true. So they joined with more than a dozen farmers to ask the village chief, who replied that he had not received any official documents. Later, after much effort, they asked someone to write a report and requested Township Head Zhou to explain, but Zhou put it aside for more than a month without paying attention. The landlords also unanimously said: "There is absolutely no such thing as a two-five rent reduction." After much effort, it was all in vain. But after repeatedly asking the County Farmers' Association, they always said it was true, so they had to submit another report to the County Farmers' Association. The County Farmers' Association approved their request to organize a Township Farmers' Association before they could start the rent reduction procedures. Therefore, they invited more than thirty tenant farmers to discuss the matter at the Deng Clan Ancestral Hall. Unexpectedly, four or five days later, the police station sent several armed officers to arrest Deng and another farmer, Deng Zhixian. They were later released on bail by the County Farmers' Association. Deng was not discouraged by this setback and continued to work on it.

After a considerable period of time, Deng obtained a copy of the County Government's "Two-Five Rent Reduction" notice from the County Farmers' Association and posted it in its old location at his house. Upon seeing it, the farmers immediately sent a report to the County Government, and after the County Government approved it, the "Two-Five Rent Reduction" truly became a reality. The tenant farmers took the County Government's approval and demanded that the landlords return the rent grain reduced by "Two-Five." Naturally, returning the reduced rent was not so simple. The landlords would not give up until they were forced to. So the farmers, according to the County Farmers' Association's method, sought out more than a hundred farmers, organized the Township Farmers' Association, and requested that County Senator Ding go to the township to provide guidance. On that day, before Senator Ding arrived, there were many rumors, and some farmers were frightened and ran home.

Two Arrests Indeed, before long, the Township Office sent plainclothes armed police. Fortunately, Ding arrived at this time. Ding inquired about the mission of the armed police and learned that they were acting on the orders of the Township Head to persuade the farmers to disband and not establish the Farmers' Association. Ding was quite angry at the time and sternly rebuked them, announcing to the farmers that this was the Township Office deliberately making things difficult and that they should not be afraid because the County Farmers' Association had its own solutions. But unexpectedly, Deng was suddenly accused of disrupting public order not long after and taken to the County Government. However, Deng was not detained this time. As soon as he arrived at the County Government, he was bailed out by Meng, the director of the County Farmers' Association. Deng suffered no harm from the two arrests. On the contrary, he gained great trust among the farmers. Therefore, at the Township Farmers' Association Congress held in March of last year, more than 3,000 members arrived, and he was elected as the executive director, ascending to the throne of farmers' leader. Since then, he and the County Farmers' Association instructor, Wei Xingfan, have been walking barefoot,奔走奔走了奔走 for several months, going to various villages to elect 正副组长. The farmers of Zhenyan Township were completely organized.

Power Overthrows the Township Head After Deng became the farmers' leader, because he gained the trust of the farmers, all the farmers in the township obeyed his every word. Every time they did something, there was nothing they could not achieve. In the township, the Township Head, as the head of the township, originally had supreme authority, but he could not help but give way to this farmers' leader. Sometimes, if the Township Office could not get things done, it had to seek help from Executive Director Deng. For example, the Township Office sometimes convened meetings, and it would take several days for everyone to arrive, but if the Farmers' Association convened a meeting, no one would ask for leave or be absent. The grain reduced by "Two-Five Rent Reduction" was also returned to the farmers under Deng's leadership. The neighboring townships did not have a leadership figure like Deng, so in Yiyang, only Zhenyan Township achieved the "Two-Five Rent Reduction." Not only did the other townships not achieve it, but the farmers had not even heard of it. Therefore, Deng's jealousy and hatred from the landlords became even more intense.

Six Thugs Launch a Surprise Attack Deng had such potential in the township, and a group of landlords who were jealous of him always thought of ways to eliminate him. Last year, Deng was accused several times, saying that he was the leader of a secret society and suspected of being a Communist, and also said that he had done traitorous work during the occupation. In fact, Deng was very active in the township, but he had lived to be over forty years old, and the most prosperous place he had ever been to was only Yiyang City. He had not even been to Taohuajiang and Lanxi, the more prosperous towns in Yiyang County. Changsha and Yuanjiang were only places he had heard of from others. How could such a truly rustic old man know anything about secret societies or communists? Last winter, someone used a drill to make a big hole in the wall to aim at Deng's house, but he was not harmed at the time. Seeing that the environment was dangerous, he convened a meeting of various team leaders on December 21st of the old lunar calendar, handed over the accounts he had handled, asked everyone to settle them, and firmly resigned from the position of executive director. But the team leaders who attended the meeting did not allow him to resign, and after several hours of arguing, they decided to allow a re-election this year.

After this meeting, someone secretly told him that night that someone wanted to assassinate him and told him to leave home quickly. But he was a pauper, and it was the end of the year, so where could he go? He went to a more remote place,躲了一回又走回家， he thought this was just a rumor. Who would have thought that early in the morning on the 23rd (February 2nd), while he was still lying in bed, six thugs wearing short clothes came, tied him up with ropes, dragged him behind the house, and killed him.

Farmers Fear Being Implicated After Deng Meikui was killed, some timid farmers hid in the mountains and did not even dare to come back for the old lunar new year. According to the report of Inspector Jiang of the Department of Social Affairs who investigated the matter: when he went to the township, the farmers were all "deeply afraid of being implicated and unwilling to speak the truth." As for the county government's report to the Department of Social Affairs, it said that Deng had organized a secret society, opened a gambling house, and that his murder was unrelated to the "Two-Five Rent Reduction," but that he usually "associated with gangsters, and his death was likely due to a feud."

Who killed Deng Meikui? As of now, it is still unknown. However, given the concern of Director Liu and Director Xiao for this case, it is believed that after the two of them go to investigate in person, the truth may not be difficult to reveal. (Our newspaper dispatches staff member Huang Chao Ru)

Changsha Citizens' Drinking Water Problem to Be Solved This Year [Our Newspaper, Changsha, 6th Dispatch] Changsha has a population of nearly 500,000, and the city's drinking water problem has always relied on the Xiang River. Residents who live far from the river use well water, which is very unclean. Before the War of Resistance, the Construction Department planned to install tap water, but it was suspended due to the war. After the restoration, the Good Samaritan Relief Organization was established, and it had the opportunity to apply to UNRRA to purchase machinery and equipment. This proposal became a reality. After contacting UNRRA, the total cost of all machinery and water pipes was US$190,370. After deducting US$57,000 from the municipal government and US$63,370 due to the lack of supplies for the Baizhen pipeline, there was still a shortage of US$60,000. After Director Yu Jichuan, the director of the preparatory committee, contacted Shanghai several times, it was changed to a 30% cash payment, leaving a shortage of only US$18,000. After deducting US$6,000 from the appropriation of 500 million yuan to the Hunan Provincial Bank, the actual amount owed is only US$12,000. With the price burden reduced and the machinery arriving in Shanghai one after another, work has recently become tense. In addition to sending representative Zhang Hua to Shanghai to collect and transport the machinery, Director Yu Jichuan invited Chairman Wang, Chairman Zhang, and other committee members to discuss and supervise the project on the 5th. After the meeting, Yu announced that the meeting had decided on five principles: (1) Increase capital to 20 billion. (2) Establish a company when sufficient funds have been raised. (3) Invite the Agricultural Construction Company to join the equity and request the Provincial Bank to accept the association's loan of 1 billion yuan approved by the Four Joint Commercial Bank. (4) The municipal government will expedite the purchase of the original site. (5) Increase staff for office work starting today. It is reported that the water tower will be located at either Miaogao Peak or Tianxin Pavilion. If there are no unexpected obstacles along the way, it is hoped that it will be completed this year.

Jiangyin Hefeng Rice Mill Embezzles Grain for Tax Collection [Our Newspaper, Jiangyin, 8th] In this county, rice mills handle the processing of grain collected for the actual payment of land tax. A scandal occurred at the Nanwai Hefeng Rice Mill a few days ago (the 5th). Zhang Ziqiang, a warehouse manager from Nanxin Bridge, Maxixiang, escorted ten boats of tax grain to the factory for processing. When weighing the first boat on site, it was found that it was 366 jin short of the 190 dan loaded. Zhang stated that there was no loss along the way and that the weight was exactly as specified, so the reason for the shortage was unclear. After investigation, it was discovered that the weight had been filled with the wrong material and covered with white paper, making it heavier and unbalanced, resulting in the loss. He immediately negotiated with the factory. Because the shortage of grain had been clarified, Gu Ruiyu, a staff member of the Grain Department stationed at the factory, came forward to mediate and changed the scale for further discussion. It is said that yesterday (the 6th), the Grain Supervision Committee learned of the above situation and sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the factory in order to handle it according to law.

Ministry of Education Cares for Youth; Finds Ways to Provide Relief at Any Time; Order to National Schools to State the Past Situation [Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 8th] The Ministry of Education recently issued an order to national secondary schools and above: "During the War of Resistance, the government, in order to show compassion for students from the occupied areas who came to the rear and had difficulty seeking education due to hardship, established a loan system. By the winter of the 29th year, prices soared, and not only were students in the war zone facing daily hardship, but many students in non-war zones were also unable to support themselves. Therefore, in November of that year, the "Student Meal Subsidy Measures" were formulated, with war zone students divided into full loan and half loan categories, and the meal expenses of self-funded students were divided into full subsidy and half subsidy. From August of the 32nd year, separate public-funded student measures were formulated, specifying the percentage by department. The original loan students continued to receive loans until graduation. From the 34th academic year, due to the expansion of the war zone, the "Measures for Granting Public Funds to Students of National Secondary Schools and Above and Provincial Junior Colleges and Above During the War" were revised, with students from the war zone and students whose economic sources were cut off given priority for public funds, regardless of department. Until the 35th academic year, although the victory of the War of Resistance had been one year, the national economy had not yet recovered due to various reasons, so the new students recruited by various schools were still subject to the original public-funded student measures, but the percentage of quotas was slightly changed, and all original loan students were converted to public funds, and the meal expenses borrowed over the years were completely exempted from repayment. As for students who returned to school from military service after being approved by the Ministry for distribution and loyal and outstanding youths who escaped from bandit areas, they were all given full public funds, without being subject to quota restrictions. By the 36th academic year, the victory of the War of Resistance was two years away, and the original public-funded student measures should have been cancelled. However, due to the lack of peace in bandit areas and the decline of people's livelihoods, the government, in order to show compassion for students' hardships and encourage their studies, revised the scholarship measures from the 36th academic year, and the original students who had been approved for public funds continued to receive them until the end of their studies. As for the normal school students, childcare students, youth army returning students, border students, children of revolutionary and anti-Japanese meritorious persons, and students of the Honor Guard admitted in the 36th academic year, they were all given full public funds, without being subject to quota restrictions. Also, during the 36th academic year, the pacification zone was expanded, and there were many students from bandit areas who urgently needed relief. Therefore, a "Relief Measure for Students from Bandit Areas in National and Provincial Junior Colleges and Above" was reinstated, exempting those who had been approved for relief from tuition and accommodation fees and providing meals according to the general public-funded student meal standards. In summary, in the past ten years, even during the War of Resistance and national construction and the bandit suppression period, when expenses were enormous and the economy was extremely difficult, the government has consistently adhered to its intention to care for youth and has found ways to provide relief at any time. Even the public meal expenses for students currently amount to nearly 100 billion yuan per month, which is the greatest effort that has been made. It is only feared that the aforementioned measures currently in effect have been promulgated for a long time and may not be fully understood. Therefore, they are hereby restated and promulgated again for your information. This order."

Based on my personal observations, I can at least say that a portion of Chinese people seem to have become numb, their nerves dulled, taking a nonchalant attitude towards everything around them, embracing an attitude of "it can be, it cannot be." To put it plainly, this phenomenon stems from people's excessive patience; to put it nicely, it could be termed "mature and steady" or "the doctrine of the mean"; to put it bluntly, it's a manifestation of "muddling along" and "laissez-faire," which has a significantly negative impact on society's future.

Let's take the relationships between individuals as an example: Person A and Person B may, in the depths of their hearts, not only lack respect for each other but have even reached the point of "hating each other to the bone." Yet, when they meet, they inevitably greet each other with a smile and a nod, exchanging pleasantries. After being seated as host and guest, they still end up discussing the weather, current affairs, and laughing and joking. On the surface, their relationship seems as harmonious as ever, perhaps even more courteous than usual. Rarely does anyone openly express dislike or directly engage in conflict. As for incidents like the recent newspaper report of two senators "almost coming to blows due to verbal clashes," they are quite rare examples in our China, certainly not as common as the frequent brawls among parliamentarians in democratic countries like England and America, which are seen as ordinary occurrences. Why is this? Of course, we can say that it's because our people value etiquette and emphasize tolerance, hence leading to this. But conversely, we can also say that this is a display of hypocrisy, stemming from a lack of genuine emotional expression.

Let's take another example, a portion of people in cities: The reason people must live in cities like Shanghai is either because they are native to the city and have no way to relocate, or because of job-related reasons, making it impossible to leave the city, or because they are wealthy and can enjoy more of urban life, making them reluctant to leave. However, besides these two major categories of citizens, there are still many people who, when asked about their origin, are not locals; when their occupation is examined, it is likely that they have no fixed job; when their wealth is assessed, it cannot be described as plentiful, naturally ruling out enjoyment and pleasure. They live in small houses, and the utensils for cooking are as tiny as children's toys. In such an environment, they live, sleep, eat, and are born there, breathing in polluted air and crowding into public transportation like sardines. Logically speaking, this is simply a meaningless life, yet in reality, many people endure this environment, staying in the city without planning to return home. Why is this? In my personal view, this is probably still due to numbness, the so-called "a movement is worse than stillness," embracing a "muddling along" attitude? Therefore, they stagnate in the city, too lazy to move.

This also reminds me of the general attitude of Chinese people towards "games." Vigorous games such as "sports" have only emerged in recent years; races, horse races, soccer games, and so on, are all foreign games, not national essence. The national essence of games often emphasizes "stillness," such as playing chess, mahjong, or scholars composing poems together. Therefore, a scholar once said that Westerners, when they play, play with great enthusiasm; he continued, "When they work, they also work with enthusiasm." Indeed, if one truly values efficiency in handling affairs, one must let oneself indulge fully when playing and work diligently when working!

A person with vitality and vigor must not be careless or ambiguous; they must have strong "love" and "hate." Only those who can truly appreciate "beauty" will hate "ugliness," and only those who truly hate "ugliness" will see "beauty." Therefore, "beauty" and "ugliness" must be clearly distinguished, and "good" and "evil" must be clearly defined. For the beautiful and the good, we must praise them to the heavens; for the ugly and the evil, we must denounce them to the depths of the earth. Only in this way can we appear lively and vigorous. A person without strong "hate" will also lack strong "love." The same applies to a nation. A nation without strong "love" and "hate" is often a common trait of old people; a nation without strong "love" and "hate" is an aging nation!

### Fallen Phoenix Slope Wang Baili
During the Three Kingdoms period, "Phoenix Fledgling Sir" Pang Tong was known to all for dying at "Fallen Phoenix Slope," based on the popular Romance of the Three Kingdoms: Tong advanced his troops to this place, his horse stumbled and he could not ride, Xuande gave him his own horse, the guards saw his horse and suspected it was Xuande, a barrage of arrows fell, and Tong died. Earlier, Tong reined in his horse and asked the name of the place, a soldier told him it was "Fallen Phoenix Slope," Tong exclaimed; 'My Dao name is "Phoenix Fledgling," and this place is named "Fallen Phoenix," is it not unfavorable to me!' And it was indeed fulfilled. (The gist is like this) In my view, Pang Shiyuan's death in this battle is indeed a credible historical event, but "Fallen Phoenix Slope" did not exist at that time, nor did it have that name. The so-called "Fallen Phoenix Slope" originated from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. This is a embellishment by novelists, and later people did not investigate and thus took it as a place name, so when Mr. Yuyang mourned Shi Yuan, he had the three characters "Fallen Phoenix Slope" written into the title. This is the kind of thing that is "common sayings not examined, flowing into paintings." According to the Biography of Pang Tong in the Records of the Three Kingdoms: "The First Lord advanced to besiege Wei County, Tong led the troops to attack the city, and was hit and killed by a stray arrow." This is consistent with the First Lord's Annals, which states, "The army surrounded Wei City, the city fell, and entered Chengdu." Therefore, Pang Tong's death occurred in Wei County, which is beyond doubt. According to Wang Dongxu's Random Notes from Liunan, Tong's place of death was at the foot of Luto Mountain, and his tomb still exists today. Liunan is known for its extensive knowledge, so his statement should have some basis. Luto Mountain is located north of Deyang County in Sichuan today, with a pass called Luto Pass. During the reign of Emperor Xianzong of the Tang Dynasty, Gao Chongwen was sent to conquer Liu Pi, broke Luto Pass, and then entered Chengdu. Du Gongbu's poem Luto Mountain says: "Now that the dangers are exhausted, I am glad the plains are wide." It is that place, because entering Chengdu, only this mountain is dangerous, and the roads west of the pass are all flat. This and Gao Chongwen's "breaking Luto Pass and entering Chengdu" and Liu Xianzhu's "surrounding Wei City, the city fell, and entering Chengdu" are consistent in their routes. So, when Pang Tong followed Xianzhu to conquer Shu, Luto Mountain was a necessary passage. Once Luto Pass was broken, the gateway to Chengdu was opened, so both sides of the attack and defense at that time regarded this pass as a must-contend place. Pang Tong was under the pass, so he was shot by random arrows. Liunan said that his place of death was at the foot of Luto Mountain, which is credible. Pang Tong's biography says that he died in Cone County. Perhaps Luto Mountain was under the jurisdiction of Wei County at that time, and the historians spoke in general terms. As for Luo Guanzhong's so-called "Fallen Phoenix Slope," he must have known it was Luto Mountain, or because the "Phoenix Fledgling" died there, so he "deified" his statement to relax the readers' mood?

Name Bai Shui
It's a bizarre notion that a name is linked to one's fortune and misfortune throughout life. However, it's not entirely unfounded. I have a friend who strongly believes in "onomastics"—or something like that—According to him, Chinese names with a total stroke count of 22 inevitably lead to power but end in tragedy, while 24 strokes guarantee lifelong success. Therefore, he changed his name to one with 24 strokes to attract good fortune. However, it is also said that such deliberate alterations are ineffective; only names unintentionally obtained at birth are auspicious. He cited many examples, but I've forgotten most of them, except for Lin Baisheng, a key figure in the puppet regime, who had 22 strokes in his name. Such far-fetched associations can sometimes alleviate boredom. In the past, during the imperial examination era, names were often tied to success or failure, a frequently observed phenomenon. For instance, Wang Shoupeng from Shandong, a champion in a former Qing Dynasty examination, - later served as Zhang Zongchang's education director and persuaded Zhang to carve the Thirteen Classics - was selected by the Empress Dowager Cixi because his name fulfilled her requirements, coinciding with her 70th birthday that year. Another example is Wan Mingyu from Guangdong, who, during an audience, had his name misheard as "Wan Min Qiong" ("ten thousand people are poor") due to his accent. This was considered inauspicious, and he was dismissed from his position. Later, he changed his name to Wan Wuhe, but never achieved success. During the recent legislative elections, I heard from friends in Nanjing that some candidates benefited from having easy-to-remember names. For instance, "Hu Dunyu" was associated with "He Tun Yu" ("puffer fish"), and "Huang Tong" was associated with "Fang Dong" ("landlord"), with their crucial connections to eating and housing, thus deeply impressing voters.

Emperors are often confused, and adding a "geng" character to a female emperor's name exemplifies this. The Empress Dowager Cixi was bewildered by the reformers and became terrified at the mere mention of Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao. Therefore, during the late Guangxu era, after the Boxer Rebellion, Qu Hongji, Cen Chunxuan, and Lin Shaonian, among others, served as Grand Councilors and united to exclude Prince Qing and Yuan Shikai's faction. Prince Qing was on the verge of collapse when Qu Ziju inadvertently leaked the Empress Dowager's plan to depose Prince Qing to the diplomatic corps, which was published in The Times of London. The diplomatic community inquired with the Empress Dowager, who was enraged, and the Qu family fell out of favor. As for the Cen family, the situation was even more remarkable. Someone advised Old Qing to have Cen's photograph taken with Liang Qichao at a Shanghai photography studio, claiming that he was a reformer. The Empress Dowager became even more furious, and the reform faction was completely wiped out, leading to an irreversible decline in the late Qing political situation. Given such a mindset, the following anecdote also occurred, as recorded in Liang Shiyi's Chronicle of Events in the 29th year of Guangxu:

"In the intercalary fifth month, Mr. Liang participated in the special examination for economic expertise... He was recommended by Minister Xu Songge and Vice Minister Dai Shaohai (i.e., Xu... Dai Hongci). Their evaluations included: 'Possesses clear and far-sighted intellect, is simple and unpretentious, and has diligently studied Chinese and Western geography, naval warfare, and military science for years, without respite.'... On the fifteenth day, the Emperor personally presided over the imperial examination at the Hall of Preserving Harmony... A total of forty-eight candidates were selected for the first class and seventy-nine for the second class. Mr. Liang was ranked first in the first class, and Gui Dian was ranked first in the second class. Both were from Guangdong, a coincidence. After the list was announced, but before the re-examination, stubborn and corrupt officials spread rumors, claiming that many of them were revolutionaries. A certain Grand Councilor particularly disliked the special examination. During an audience, the Empress Dowager asked: 'I heard that the candidates from the special examination are mixed in quality and have impure intentions. Is there any truth to this?' He replied: 'Liang Shiyi, ranked first in the first class, is from Guangdong and is Liang Qichao's brother. The last character of his name is also the same as Kang Zuyi. Liang at the beginning and Kang at the end, his identity is evident!' The Empress Dowager became even more displeased. For the second re-examination, four new examiners were appointed, and the process was hastily completed. Only nine candidates, including Yuan Jiagu, were selected for the first class, and eighteen candidates, including Feng Shanzheng, were selected for the second class. A hundred candidates were eliminated, and all were not outstanding... After the first examination, slanderous rumors abounded. Friends and relatives, fearing that Mr. Liang would face unforeseen dangers, urged him to leave Beijing. Mr. Liang calmly replied: 'The truth of the matter will soon become clear. My ancestral home is Ershui, not Xinhui, and my name is Shiyi, not Zushi. Why should I leave?'..."

Can you imagine a "special examination" specifically designed to seek "talents for reform" being "dismissed" because its name was remotely related to the old reformists? But I tell you, Chinese politics in the past can largely be viewed in this light. The factors that determined success or failure certainly went beyond just names, but "achievements" and "abilities" were definitely not involved.

Speculation Nian Hong
It is said that today is the era of speculators. Observing the general situation in society, those who can stand firm, climb high, and jump far are all great speculators.

Speculation is said to be about seeking luck, like gambling. Success leads to kingship, failure to banditry. I think such speculation is too dangerous. Clever people certainly don't do this, and those who do are certainly not clever, just guys who are a cut above the fools who don't move an inch.

Since it is called "speculation," one should accurately grasp the opportunity, "hit the mark with one throw," adapt to the circumstances, and act according to the situation. One must hit the mark with every throw and never miss, that is the true speculator and also the "wisest" among the masses.

I heard such a story: Two people were fighting over an object, unable to decide for a long time. So, A wrote two small pieces of paper and said to B, let B choose first. If the paper says "B," the object belongs to B, and if it says "A," the object belongs to A. As a result, the one chosen was indeed "A," and A took it rightfully and openly. In fact, both pieces of paper that A wrote were "A," so of course there was absolutely no share for B. This method, which never goes wrong, is of course much more clever than the stupid method of arguing and scolding with B, and then fighting until heads are broken and blood flows.

Everyone knows how to play tricks, but they are worthless once exposed; what is difficult about speculation? Just ride on the wall. What is annoying is that this wall is too narrow and easy to fall off, landing in an ambiguous position.

But there are not many who fall off after all, not to mention that when riding on the wall, they look left and right, how happy. So the speculators are also mostly semi-black and semi-white, neither monks nor Taoists, neither donkeys nor horses.

Looking around, demonic energy fills the sky, and the mischief of these kinds of freaks must be one of the reasons.

Wandering Flower Chen Shenyan
Chapter 12: A Chance Encounter (93)

Dao Yun spoke first, "I didn't know Miss Gu went to bed late, otherwise, I would have come over to chat, because I found your stage experiences from yesterday very interesting." Qi Wan said, "I found Mr. Liu's experiences under the mercury lamp very interesting as well. I think acting on stage is easy, but filming under the mercury lamp is difficult." Dao Yun said, "Others may think it's not easy, but for Miss Gu, I don't think there's any difficulty at all. With Miss Gu's intelligence, as long as there's a good script and a good director, a very complete film can be made." Qi Wan was pleased to hear Dao Yun's praise but said, "Everything seems easy, but when you're actually in the situation, all sorts of difficulties arise!" Dao Yun said, "Others may feel difficulties, but for Miss Gu, it's effortless. As long as you pay attention, there's no way to fail." Qi Tong said, "My enthusiasm is not as strong as before." Saying this, she seemed to have infinite emotion. Dao Yun paused, smiled slightly, and said, "A person in society is like acting in a play, with all sorts of encounters. As long as you have perseverance, you can overcome difficulties. Regarding Miss Gu's grievances, although there were records in the newspapers a few days ago, I think it's unimportant. To go a step further, it's good to create a smoke screen. But most importantly, Miss Gu shouldn't be discouraged by this little setback. Life is like acting in a play, full of numbers. Take me, for example, I've been in the film industry for a few years, and I don't know how many tumbles I've taken and how much suffering I've endured, but every time I fail, I first reflect and analyze the reasons for my failure in detail, understanding the crux of the matter. If the mistake is my own, I should strive to correct my shortcomings. If the blame lies with the other party, I should realize it. So-called learn a lesson from every loss, no matter how bad. After I fail, I never resent the other party, because everything depends on both parties' emotions and sincerity. If the other party has no emotions or sincerity, it's because I proceeded blindly, creating a tragedy, so why blame the other party! Not only do I not resent the other party, but I also remain optimistic after the setback, because since things have failed, I treat them as a flash in the pan, fleeting and gone. There's no need to cling to them, which would affect my future and even cause nervous breakdowns and damage my health. After disappointment, one must have an optimistic outlook on life and shift goals, and all worries can be resolved! I think it's most meaningless for a person to take the road of suicide due to regret, bewilderment, or temporary indignation. A person must have the courage to fight against the environment, create a bright path, and do something beneficial to the country and the people, so as not to live in vain!"

Unexpected Wealth Tong Tuo
One day, a doctor in New York suddenly had a whim to go to a stockbroker's office to buy some useless stocks to paper the walls of his office. The stockbroker sold the doctor shares of a company that had already closed down for thirty-four dollars.

The doctor then papered his entire room with colorful waste stocks. The time was 1930, the era of the stock market crash of the previous year. The stocks he bought were still worthless.

Six months later, the doctor received a call from the stockbroker, willing to buy back the previous waste stocks for twice the price. The doctor only spent thirty-four dollars when he bought them, and now they were willing to pay double to buy them back, which aroused the doctor's suspicion. He went to other places to inquire about the news. It turned out that this closed company had reopened and raised funds to redeem old shares. The doctor felt hesitant because these stocks had become part of his room. Later, this problem was finally solved. The company sent someone to his room to stamp "Fully Paid" on the wallpapered areas, and then paid the doctor eighteen thousand dollars and left. It was truly beyond his wildest dreams.

One part of America's largest treasure is forgotten securities that have no market value. According to estimates by the American magazine "National Business," these securities are worth over ten billion dollars. They all belong to companies that have already closed down.

In fact, many of these closed companies have merged with other companies, or changed their names and merged with a third company. After a few years, these existing companies may have changed forms several times and expanded into a large company. Only a few stockbrokers in the United States are seeking a way out of this maze of mergers. One of the companies specializing in unpopular stocks is Smith Company, founded in 1880.

Smith first tasted the flavor of unpopular stocks when he was an inspector in an old-fashioned product exchange. His boss gave him fifteen shares of South Carolina stock and ordered him to buy it as waste paper. Smith went to a stockbroker to inquire. The stockbroker was willing to buy back the stock for two dollars per share. He immediately reported it to his boss, who ordered him to sell it himself, and he could take the money.

On the way, Smith met another stockbroker who offered a higher price for South Carolina stock. Smith agreed to sell a share, but with one condition: the price would not be set now, and after he sold it, each would get half of the price. A month later, Smith received a check from the stockbroker for four hundred dollars, with a note stating that the money was half the price of the South Carolina stock.

This mysterious stock could not help but make Smith very excited. He immediately wrote to the treasury of South Carolina to inquire. The reply said that the state was indeed preparing to redeem old stocks at a high price, and that they had recently paid a stockbroker a total of twelve hundred dollars for a stock that was redeemed. The stockbroker also "ate the difference" of four hundred dollars and split the eight hundred dollars with Smith. Smith then went to negotiate with the stockbroker about why he "ate the difference" so much. The stockbroker was frank and said, "That's right, isn't this experience worth the difference of two hundred dollars?" Smith thought it made sense and stopped arguing. From then on, he made his fortune and opened a stock company in New York. Smith's stock company has two famous points on Wall Street: one is that he likes to sell unpopular stocks. He feels that the profit is great and the interest is strong when hot chestnuts are popped out of a cold stove; the second point is that the company does not install telephones. If there is a sale or purchase, you must come to ask for advice. Now his company is famous as "Smith without a telephone." "They can write letters to inquire," Smith said, "These stocks have been shelved for decades, and it doesn't matter if the reply is delayed by one or two days."

Young Police Officer Tu Wannong
If a youth of extreme purity and goodness, after training, is made to participate in the central strata of society to do guidance and disciplinary work, then at the very least, they should be able to exert their experience and fulfill their duties faithfully. Regardless of whether their experience is qualified or their views are correct, within the scope of their duties, they should be able to do it faithfully. That is a matter of course. However, let us now face society directly; what is the situation?

Isn't the so-called "youth police" supposed to undergo a round of training and propaganda? The principle of strictly practicing thrift and inspecting restaurants is very good. The essence and spirit of the "youth police" are not bad either. But what does society and reality give them? In a word, it can be said to be: hypocrisy, deception, coldness! When the young police arrive, the restaurants will first stall for a while, and then deceive them and that's it. And those who cast cold eyes are easily found around them. Therefore, inspections gradually become routine, coming once in a while to take a look, and then quietly leaving.

This is what I have seen with my own eyes, not an assumption or fabrication.

May I ask: If a pure and good youth enters society and encounters and experiences such things, what kind of sense of responsibility and outlook on life will they develop? Originally, they were supposed to correct others, but now, they themselves are the first to turn bad!

Bad habits cannot be planted in this way from childhood. Although this is a small issue, it has a great impact on police administration and juvenile psychology. It is not permissible to accept bad habits as normal and ignore them!

A Month in Seclusion Zhong Ming
Spending a month of winter vacation in the countryside is like hibernating for a month. It was as if I was isolated from the entire world there, with everything displaying peace and tranquility. I absolutely couldn't find any place of instability. I remember walking on the road back to my hometown at the end of the lunar year, and the faint sound of gongs and drums in the distance, as well as the barking of dogs in the nearby villages, gave me a strange feeling at first.

People in the countryside rarely read newspapers, so few people care about national affairs. Unless the Japanese had been killing people right next to them at the start of the war of resistance, they would not have known what was going on outside, let alone what problems were causing the trouble. There are fewer than ten families on our street who subscribe to the newspaper, which tires a newsboy to travel dozens of miles every day. Because of the inconvenience of transportation, the newspapers they see are always several days old. When people in the city are reading the news of the day, we are still reading the newspapers that people have long thrown away, and over and over again; moreover, it is still gratifying to have a few back issues to read. Unfortunately, it rained for several days in a row on the Lunar New Year, and the road was muddy after the rain. This only message transferring "angel" in the countryside was not like the news vendors in Shanghai who compete to sell their newspapers. When the weather was bad, even his figure disappeared. So, he simply "severed" relations with the world and lived a life like "Shangri-La" at home.

If it is unfortunate to cut off news with a familiar and concerned relative and friend, then it is even more unfortunate to isolate oneself from the familiar world that has a close connection with oneself. A world-weary person may think that isolating from the world is a kind of "detachment"; a recluse may think that this is an ideal place to retire, but in the eyes of people who want to survive and hope that the world will become more prosperous and happy, this should be a backward place that needs to be improved!

Unfortunately, there are too many places like this in China, and there are too many people who have trouble isolating themselves from the world - this is of course due to the underdeveloped transportation and the lack of universal education, but we really can't let these people hibernate indefinitely in the mud that is isolated from the outside world! On the surface, it looks like farmhouses and fields, and everything is peaceful and tranquil, but behind this wonderful picture, what is hidden is poverty and numbness!

After hibernating in my hometown for a month, when I returned to Shanghai, I could breathe in the breath of spring. The air in the countryside is fresh, that's right, but breathing in such fresh air in such an environment will still suffocate you. Let me take a deep breath!

### Democratic Lawsuit: Jinan City Civil Servant Liu Rang Sues City Councilors for Defamation

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 4th Disptach] Recently, a "democratic lawsuit" has occurred here, in which Liu Rang, acting director of the Jinan Waterworks Management Office, is suing Jinan City Councilors Lü Xiangyan and Liu Boqi. It is alleged that at the first session, third meeting, and fourth conference of the Jinan City Council on the 26th of last month, they "made statements unrelated to the meeting's agenda." He has filed a private prosecution with the Jinan City District Court, accusing Lü and Liu of slander, insult, and defamation. The original text of his complaint is as follows:

"The defendants, Lü Xiangyan and Liu Boqi, are city councilors of this city. During the city council meeting on February 26th of this year, they fabricated facts and arbitrarily slandered the plaintiff. First, Lü Xiangyan declared: 'The plaintiff has abused his power to rape a female telephone operator, openly cohabitating with her, which damages the dignity of a civil servant. At the same time, his personal finances are insufficient, so he is engaging in extensive corruption to supplement them. Please provide an explanation.' Subsequently, Liu Boqi inquired: 'It is rumored that the director previously acted as a traitor while in Qingdao. Please provide details.' Each time, the plaintiff rose to reply, but was refused. The above facts are evidenced by the meeting minutes of that day and the reports in the local Cheng Bao and Shandong Xin Bao newspapers the following day. Regardless of whether the accusations made by the defendants are purely fictitious and without any basis in fact, they are unrelated to the meeting's agenda. According to Interpretation No. 3735 issued by the Judicial Yuan on December 22, 1947, they should still be held responsible for unlawful speech. Inferred from the defendants' intentions, the reason is a personal grievance, using the meeting as an opportunity to spread accusations publicly, intending to damage the plaintiff's reputation. Moreover, the matter involves personal morals and is fabricated; their malice is evident. The fact that the plaintiff was refused to make a legitimate reply further proves that it is not comparable to making statements in good faith. Their actions constitute a violation of Article 310 of the Criminal Code. In conclusion, based on Articles 311 and 312 of the Criminal Procedure Law and Article 210 of the Criminal Code, this private prosecution is filed, requesting your court to summon the case for trial and impose appropriate punishment on the defendants."

A civil servant suing city councilors for "using a meeting as an opportunity to spread accusations publicly, intending to damage the reputation of another" is unprecedented in the entire country and is the first democratic lawsuit of its kind. According to a legal authority, "The judgment in this case is likely to become a precedent, so all parties are closely watching its development."
