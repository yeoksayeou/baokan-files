### Chairman Chiang Personally Reports to National Assembly, Urges Delegates to Uphold Discipline and Bear Heavy Responsibility as Models of Democratic Constitutionalism

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Chairman Chiang delivered a four-minute speech to the First Review Committee at the National Assembly Hall at 6:22 PM on the 17th. The Chairman, dressed in military fatigues, first went to the registration desk at the National Assembly at 5:30 PM to register, receiving badge number 2765. He then proceeded to the Presidium Office. At 6:10 PM, he took his seat on the government officials' bench and witnessed the aftermath of the chaotic scene. He waited until the adjournment to speak. The Chairman stated that he was speaking as a citizen. He briefly said: This first National Assembly was achieved only after the deaths of countless martyrs and the efforts of countless people over the past 37 years. The two major responsibilities of the National Assembly are: (1) to implement the constitution, suppress the rebellion, and build the nation; (2) to serve as a permanent model for future National Assemblies. This heavy responsibility must be shouldered by every delegate. As I see it, the current situation is very pessimistic for democratic constitutionalism. We must be models of democratic constitutionalism and not leave any stains on it. As a citizen, I urge all delegates to take responsibility, uphold discipline, and maintain order in the assembly hall. I hope that the situation we saw today will not be repeated in the future, otherwise the credibility of the National Assembly delegates will be damaged, and people at home and abroad will feel pessimistic. The Chairman's words were extremely sincere. The entire venue was silent during his speech, a stark contrast to the uproar of a few minutes earlier. The Chairman was greeted with enthusiastic cheers as soon as he finished speaking. Members of both the Min and Qing parties also applauded and supported him. The Chairman then expressed his gratitude and left.

### Director-General Chiang Convenes a Discussion Meeting, Encouraging Kuomintang National Assembly Delegates to Consider the Constitution as Unamendable

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] At 2:30 PM on the 17th, Kuomintang Director-General Chiang Kai-shek convened a discussion meeting with the party's comrades among the National Assembly delegates at the National Defense Ministry Auditorium. After listening to the opinions of various party members on matters related to the constitution, Director-General Chiang delivered an earnest speech encouraging all comrades to respect the party's traditional spirit, cherish the party's fifty-year struggle history, and understand the country's current needs. Regarding the constitution, it is advisable to follow the party's established policy, and except for temporary clauses related to the suppression of rebellion, it should be considered unamendable. All comrades were deeply moved after listening to the instructions and unanimously accepted Director-General Chiang's guidance. The discussion meeting ended at 3:15 PM.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The National Assembly held its eleventh meeting on the 17th. At 10:00 AM, Chairman Qin Dechun announced the start of the day's agenda. First, Zhang Yingshu, representative of the First Review Committee, reported that the full-day review meeting on the 16th had yielded no results. This was because the review process yesterday involved a broad discussion, with 110 people requesting to speak, but only 32 speakers were heard. Therefore, the review should continue today. The chairman then proposed, according to Article 47 of the Rules of Procedure, that since the First Review Committee's constitutional amendment proposal had not reached a conclusion, it could not be submitted to the second reading. He asked whether the assembly needed to change the agenda. After a vote, with 1,877 people present, 1,409 voted in favor, a majority passage. At 10:20 AM, the chairman announced the adjournment of the assembly, and the review committees continued to meet separately.

### In Times of Rebellion Suppression and to Cope with Contingencies, the President May Take Emergency Measures; Amendment Review Committee Passes Comprehensive Report

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The First Review Committee convened at 11:00 AM on the 17th, with Luo Wenwu presiding. Before Luo took the chair, Hu Shi, the chairman of the delegation, first presented a report stating that the original convener of the First Review Committee expressed his apology for the lack of conclusion in yesterday's discussion, and the entire group resigned in protest. After persuasion, they were reluctantly reinstated. After the chairman took office, he first apologized, then made two points: (1) the proceedings should be conducted in accordance with the rules of procedure; (2) order should be maintained in the assembly hall, and both sides of opinions should be freely expressed; (3) the chairman personally has no prejudice. Finally, he inquired about the method of speaking, whether to adopt a broad expression of opinions or to speak on each case item by item. The majority still believed that a broad review should be conducted. However, there were many free speakers in the assembly hall, most of whom believed that it was not necessary to go beyond the scope of the proposal in order to quickly end the discussion. However, Wang Peiji of the Democratic Socialist Party suddenly went to the podium and shouted that the establishment of a proposal has a certain procedure, that is, it can only be proposed after being co-signed by one-fifth of the representatives. Now it is found that there is a distinction between "big representatives" and "small representatives" in the assembly hall, and big representatives can sign on behalf of small representatives. Wang's attitude and wording were improper, and some representatives raised criticisms. For a time, the assembly hall was in chaos, with a clamor both on and off the stage. In the clamor, party consciousness was also extremely strong. After the chairman repeatedly called for the maintenance of order in the assembly hall, Wang and other representatives went off the stage and took their seats. The chairman then announced that Wang's wording was inappropriate and would be handed over to the Representatives Disciplinary Committee for handling. After the storm passed, Lin Zigui shouted loudly that the most urgent and necessary thing had happened, that is, at the time of the debate over amending the constitution and not amending it, there was a matter of abandoning the constitution happening outside the assembly hall, that is, more than 20 signing representatives came to petition and were surrounded by the police. Before Lin finished speaking, there was a snort from the stage, and Lin failed to achieve his speaking purpose and stepped down. The review then began. Qian Tianren suddenly called out "impeach the chairman," but ultimately failed to get a response and there was no further development. Zhang Danping and others continued to speak, still mostly taking the two points of supporting constitutional amendments and opposing constitutional amendments as the focus. Zhang Danping first stated: We advocate amending Article 27 of the constitution, which only increases the powers of the National Assembly. We believe that we must support any political party that can give power to the people; otherwise, we do not want it. Zhang explained the procedure for impeaching the president and vice president, first requiring a petition for impeachment signed by two-fifths of the representatives, announced thirty days later, then sent to the Legislative Yuan for proposal, and finally impeached by the National Assembly. Zhang believes that the National Assembly must have the right to free assembly. Zhu Shilie said: There is a situation in the assembly hall, that is, the party is above everything else. I am a member of the Kuomintang, but today I am speaking from the standpoint of an ordinary representative. He believes that amending Article 27 to expand the powers of the National Assembly does not shake the entire constitution. Zhu also said that if the Communist Party reaches the door, we will not be able to withstand it. Liu Yiting spoke, expressing support for increasing the powers of the National Assembly and temporary clauses. Tian Keming pointed out that overseas Chinese elections are not in line with reality and need to be amended, and that some issues are necessary for facts, so he supports the amendment, believing that it will not shake the entire constitution. The amendment passed today will not be implemented from today, and there is still a public announcement period in between. At this time, it was 12:00 noon, and the chairman announced the adjournment. The meeting continued at 4:00 PM in the afternoon, with Lin Bin as the chairman. The scene was still in an uproar. It was not until around 6:00 PM in the evening that Chairman Chiang arrived in plain clothes, and then it was quiet. The comprehensive review report submitted was then voted on and passed. The content included the temporary clauses authorizing the President and the establishment of the National Assembly's temporary session, while other proposed constitutional amendments would be discussed at the temporary session. The passed review report is recorded as follows: This review committee has reviewed the constitutional amendment cases, and it is believed that during this period of rebellion suppression, the temporary clauses proposed by Representative Mo Dehui and others are indeed necessary, and the convocation of the National Assembly temporary session should also be determined so that other proposed constitutional amendments can be properly discussed and decided during the temporary session. Based on the above intentions, it is proposed to add an item to the original proposal of Representative Mo Dehui et al. The following full text is respectfully adopted by the Assembly and transferred to the second and third readings.

Temporary Clauses for the Period of Rebellion Suppression.

In accordance with the procedure in Article 174, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution, the temporary clauses for the period of rebellion suppression are formulated as follows: During the period of rebellion suppression, in order to avoid national or public emergencies or to cope with major financial and economic changes, the President may take emergency measures with the decision of the Executive Yuan meeting, without being restricted by the procedures stipulated in Articles 39 or 43 of the Constitution.

The Legislative Yuan may change or repeal the aforementioned emergency measures in accordance with the procedure stipulated in Article 57, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution.

The end of the period of rebellion suppression shall be announced by the President or by the Legislative Yuan requesting the President to announce it.

The first National Assembly shall be convened by the President before December 25, 1950, to discuss relevant constitutional amendment cases. If the period of rebellion suppression has not been announced to end in accordance with the aforementioned regulations, the National Assembly temporary session shall decide whether the temporary clauses should be extended or repealed.

### Reform of Land and Currency Systems; Request Government to Study and Implement; Proposal Concerning National Economy Approved After Review

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The Fourth Review Committee continued to meet on the 17th, morning and afternoon, to review proposals related to the national economy, all chaired by Weng Wenhao. All 25 proposals were approved after review, with the proposals on requisitioning the assets of wealthy families, implementing land reform, and reforming the currency system being the most important. Regarding the proposals on requisitioning the assets of wealthy families and reforming the currency system, the review method of the 16th was followed, with separate merged discussions. The principles were approved, and the government was recommended to formulate measures for requisitioning the assets of wealthy families within three months, earnestly implement them, and announce the results.

For currency system reform, it was recommended that the government establish a currency system reform research committee in the short term to study reform measures. Regarding land reform, there were: (1) Chen Xihuan and others proposed immediately formulating a land reform plan, implementing "land to the tiller," and expanding the amount of agricultural loans to stabilize the lives of farmers and facilitate the suppression of rebellion; (2) Luo Dafan and others proposed recommending that the government quickly change the land system to clear the roots of chaos and complete the Three Principles of the People; (3) Shao Hongji and others proposed organizing land within a time limit, improving the rural system, increasing production, and rationally distributing it to lay the foundation for people's livelihood and consolidate the foundation of the country; (4) Cui Shuxian and others proposed requesting the government to immediately implement land reform throughout the country, so that the tiller has his own land, realize the equalization of land ownership in the Three Principles of the People, to eliminate the source of the communist bandits and save the already falling tide. The four cases were merged for discussion, passed as they were, and the government was recommended to organize a land reform research committee to study implementation measures and earnestly implement them. In addition, six proposals related to economic policy were passed. When discussing the proposal by Zhang Tifang and others to request the government to improve coal regulation, the representatives greatly criticized the government's regulation policy. A northern representative said that the government's regulation of food prevented the transport of southern grain to the north, resulting in a lack of food in major northern cities. He spoke with passion and stomped his feet, almost weeping. As a result, the case was passed and sent to the government for attention and improvement. Finally, a proposal was passed to require the government to promptly conduct property registration in preparation for conducting a one-time property tax in the future.

### National Assembly Proposes Emergency Motion, To Incorporate Kong Xianrong's Troops; Chairman Instructs to Be Reorganized by Wan Fulin

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The eleventh meeting of the National Assembly was held at 9:40 AM on the 17th, with 1,955 representatives present. The seventh group of the Presidium took turns presiding, with Qin Dechun presiding. He led all representatives in a minute of silence for the late Representative Kong Xianrong. After the silence, Secretary-General Hong Lanyou read the emergency motion proposed by the Northeast representatives for the death of Representative Kong Xianrong. The content explained that the death of Representative Kong, and the fear that his remaining subordinates would be used by the rebel bandits, suggested that the government quickly send a telegram of condolences and immediately incorporate them to strengthen the rebellion suppression force. Kong's posthumous care should be generously provided. Secondly, local armed forces should be developed, and the government should be required to rescue the Northeast with a large army to protect the country.

His old department will be reorganized by Deputy Director Wan Fulin to continue Kong's rebellion suppression legacy, Zhongzheng." The assembly then passed the temporary emergency motion to be sent to the National Government for handling.

### Kong Requested Military Power, Military Expresses Ignorance

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Anti-Japanese General and current National Assembly Representative Kong Xianrong committed suicide on the 15th. According to reporters from military sources, Kong's revolutionary struggle went as follows: After the victory of the War of Resistance, Kong Xianrong's troops and guns, more than 5,000, were compiled by the former Northeast Security Commander's Office into the Northeast Security Infantry Second Detachment, with Kong as the commander of the detachment and concurrently the commander of the Jilin, Liaoning, and Anbian border areas. The detachment was originally under the command of Liang Huasheng and fought near Yongji. In September 1947, Liang sent someone to inspect the troops, and there were too many vacancies in the troops. It was reported that the troops should be reorganized according to the actual number of people. Kong then went to Shenyang in person and stated that the troops were scattered due to the war and were not easy to concentrate, and that the cadres of the troops were all called by him during the War of Resistance and could be called his own soldiers. Chen, the concurrent director, comforted him and specially allowed the detachment to be retained without change. In October of the same year, the troops fought near Jilin. Kong was in Pan due to an event. The troops were ambushed and suffered heavy losses. Kong resigned due to the scattering of troops and a negative attitude and asked to be transferred to the Xingyuan service. His request was approved and he was appointed as a high-level staff member of the Xingyuan. The remnants of the troops were transferred to the Jilin Security Brigade for reinforcement. It was also reported that Kong went to Nanjing and repeatedly appealed to the government, 力陳 the crisis in the Northeast, hoping to be given the opportunity to regain military power, but to no avail. However, the Ministry of National Defense did not receive any requests or reports from Kong.

### Sunday Forum: How to Cultivate an Excellent Academic Atmosphere!

— Zhou Jixi

To cultivate an excellent academic atmosphere, we must first understand the reasons for the decline of the current "academic atmosphere." According to the author's observation, those who run schools and teach do not emphasize the cultivation of their own personality and the advancement of their knowledge. Some even lack the virtue to influence people and the knowledge to convince the public. When unexpected events occur, they use high-pressure tactics to deal with energetic, courageous, and sacrificing young students. They do not realize that these students cannot be suppressed by status or subdued by authority. Others use flowery words and clever arguments to deceive and lure them, not knowing that these students have pure thoughts and correct views, and cannot be deceived by empty words or enticed by great profits. Coupled with the exploitation and instigation of professional students, student movements such as strikes inevitably erupt. Therefore, to cultivate an excellent academic atmosphere, the education authorities should appoint first-class scholars with extensive knowledge, great abilities, and high moral character as university presidents. The president should respectfully invite famous teachers with noble character and specialized knowledge to serve as excellent mentors for young students in their studies and lives. Their scholarship, work ethic, treatment of others, and even every word and action can serve as models for young people. This is an educational method of influencing character through personal example rather than words. The power of this kind of education is not only a driving force for young students to be ambitious, studious, virtuous, and diligent, sufficient to cultivate an excellent academic atmosphere, but also to transform society and change customs. Therefore, this is the best way to cultivate an excellent academic atmosphere.

The rule of law in schools and the democratization of education are also good ways to cultivate an excellent academic atmosphere. For example, the private Patriotic School, founded by Mr. Cai Yuanpei as the principal and Mr. Wu Jingheng as the academic supervisor during the late Qing Dynasty, allowed students to govern the school according to law. Students were like legislators, and faculty and staff were like executors. Teachers and students taught each other, shared joys and sorrows, and loved each other like family members, truly like a large family. Later, when Mr. Cai presided over Peking University, he also allowed student autonomy, eventually making it a top institution with the most excellent academic atmosphere and the greatest contribution to scholarship. Recently, the author met with Mr. Li Zhipu, the former director of training at the Rural Reconstruction Academy, in Beijing. He said that he also adopted the spirit of student legislation, law enforcement, and self-government to cultivate the school's excellent academic atmosphere. Not only universities should do this, but also middle schools. For example, the Zhejiang Provincial Xianghu Normal School, famous at home and abroad, under the leadership of Mr. Jin Haiguan, an educator who served as the school's president for nearly twenty years, not only enabled students in the school to legislate and abide by the law, govern themselves, cultivate virtue and practice diligence, and improve their moral character and academic performance, forming an excellent academic atmosphere. The graduates who left the school to serve were also under the supervision of the school's graduate guidance department, abiding by the school's regulations, working diligently, and serving faithfully, creating a good atmosphere. Therefore, the rule of law in schools and the democratization of education are also a way to cultivate an excellent academic atmosphere.

Freedom of thought is a major issue in current education, and it is closely related to student movements and the academic atmosphere. Regarding this issue, the author has always believed that thought cannot and should not be unified. Especially in academic institutions, everyone should be allowed to think freely and without worry, and should be given a bold environment to think absolutely freely without any scruples. It is best not to interfere with anyone's mind, nor should anyone interfere with others. Thoughts can be expressed in words, and under the conditions of not violating social order and national laws, words can be used to exchange opinions, discuss issues, or seek advice and learning from others, but it is absolutely forbidden to resort to violence. Based on this principle, students' disputes arising from thought should be respected, and the books they choose to read according to their thoughts should be allowed. However, students' disputes arising from thought must be prohibited. Those who act recklessly in and out of school according to their thoughts or misuse of their thoughts must be subject to the sanctions of school rules and national laws. In the past, universities and middle schools had a "Three Principles of the People" or "Party Ideology" course. After the implementation of the constitution, universities should change it to a "Philosophy" course, and middle schools can strengthen the teaching of "Civics" to guide students' thoughts and behaviors. Regarding the teaching of doctrines, the "Three Principles of the People" can be used as the center, and the advantages and disadvantages of all other doctrines can be discussed. Because the Three Principles of the People is a trend of thought in the modern world, and it is still a mainstream of thought occupying a large area of the world and many people. It includes many modern philosophical and political doctrines and ideas. It is not the party ideology of a party, nor is it a religious classic, but a comprehensive and inclusive doctrine of saving the country. The Three Principles of the People can be explained from an academic standpoint, thereby guiding the thoughts and behaviors of young students and cultivating an academic atmosphere of freedom of thought. Closely related to freedom of thought is the freedom of research, lecturing, speech, and publication. Universities have the freedom of research and lecturing, and people have the freedom of speech and publication. This is a principle unanimously recognized by modern democratic countries. Only by enjoying the rights of free research and free lecturing, and ensuring the freedom of speech and publication, can scholarship advance and society become civilized. Recently, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) also particularly emphasized this principle, prompting the attention of various countries. Article 11 of the "Constitution of the Republic of China" also has such an explicit provision: "The people have the freedom of speech, lecturing, writing, and publication." After the implementation of the constitution, it must be put into practice and demonstrated in facts, and this precious democratic spirit must be promoted to cultivate an academic atmosphere of free research and free lecturing to promote the democratization of education.

The school environment is also related to the cultivation of an excellent academic atmosphere. For example, it is not suitable to run a university in a large metropolitan area where indulgence and extravagance prevail. It is best to run a university in a place not far from a large city but with an excellent environment, beautiful scenery, quietness, and convenient transportation, such as "Fudan University" not far from Shanghai and "Wuhan University" not far from Wuchang. These are suitable places to run universities. Even secondary schools are best located in the countryside, such as the Zhejiang Provincial Xianghu Normal School mentioned earlier, which is located on the bank of Xianghu Lake and at the foot of Yanhu Mountain not far from Hangzhou. Students studying in the quiet and beautiful environment of mountains and clear waters are most likely to cultivate noble character and study profound knowledge, and are especially likely to cultivate the spirit of hard work, endurance, service, struggle, and sacrifice, as well as the virtues of diligence, thrift, honesty, sincerity, trustworthiness, and love. The habits and customs in the school will naturally be improved day by day, forming a beautiful academic atmosphere.

Education is the most expensive undertaking and the most arduous work. Therefore, future educational funding must implement the provisions of Article 164 of the Constitution: "The funds for education, science, and culture shall not be less than 15 percent of the total budget of the central government, not less than 25 percent of the total budget of the province, and not less than 35 percent of the total budget of the city or county. The educational and cultural funds and industries established according to law shall be guaranteed." At the same time, it is also necessary to increase teachers' salaries to reach pre-war levels, increase academic research funding so that it can truly be used for academic research, and especially improve teachers' welfare and protect teachers' careers. In this way, educators can have stable lives, work with peace of mind, and patiently guide young people to improve their academic performance, cultivate virtue, and develop an excellent academic atmosphere.

### Exploration of Mount 積石 (Jishi): A Vast Expanse of Ice and Snow with Sparse Population; Highest Peak Does Not Exceed 19,000 Feet

[Our Newspaper Lanzhou Seventeenth Dispatch] The Central Aviation Corporation's (央航) special plane for exploring Mount 積石 (Jishi) was personally piloted by Chen Wenkuan, deputy manager of the Central Aviation Corporation, with Zheng Jiefu and Xue Yingnian serving as co-pilots and communication officers, respectively. Six Chinese reporters and eight foreign reporters accompanied the flight. Before boarding, each person was given an oxygen tank and a parachute, both instructed how to be used by Chen Xiangjiao. The plane took off at 12:55 pm, flying southwest towards Mount 積石 (Jishi). The area was characterized by undulating peaks and yellow sand, appearing desolate and bleak. At around 2:00 pm, Mount 積石 (Jishi) vaguely came into view. The mountain peaks were covered with white snow, and there were few signs of human habitation. From the aerial view, only a vast expanse of ice and snow, devoid of vegetation, was visible. The special plane, in an attempt to find Mount 積石 (Jishi)'s highest peak, circled above it for more than three hours but ultimately found nothing. According to radar measurements, the highest peak in the Mount 積石 (Jishi) area does not exceed 19,000 feet. Only Mount Geluosheng, located at the junction of Gansu, Qinghai, and Sichuan, may exceed 21,000 feet. However, since it is not within the Mount 積石 (Jishi) area and there are many mountains similar to Mount Geluosheng within the country, there is no need to conduct precise measurements. The special plane left Mount 積石 (Jishi) and turned back at around 6:00 pm. The flight altitude reached 20,400 feet yesterday. Despite having oxygen equipment, there were still some who suffered from suffocation. Fortunately, the weather was good, and the flight was smooth, so only a few experienced nausea and vomiting. However, the landing caused a moment of panic. Because the special plane had lingered in the Mount 積石 (Jishi) area for a long time in search of the highest peak, it was already dark when it returned to Lanzhou. Twilight descended, and thick fog filled the air. The Lanzhou airport also lacked night navigation equipment, causing the reporters to panic and prepare to escape. Fortunately, Chen's piloting skills were excellent, and he was experienced, and he finally landed safely at 7:40 pm, totaling six hours and forty minutes of high-altitude flight. After resting briefly upon returning to the city, they attended a dinner hosted by Zhang Zhizhong and Guo Jijiao. Zhang praised this as an excellent start and said that the world's attention to the mystery of Mount 積石 (Jishi)'s height has finally been revealed, and everyone should be satisfied, and he hoped that Chinese and American scientific circles could cooperate more closely to contribute to science. He also indicated that there should be a more concrete organization and methods to explore the mountain to seek more satisfactory gains. Subsequently, there was casual conversation, which was extremely harmonious, and they dispersed at 10:30 pm.

### Special Plane Arrives in Chongqing via Chengdu; Mount 積石 (Jishi) Explored Again En Route

[Our Newspaper Chongqing Seventeenth Dispatch] The Central Aviation Corporation's (央航) special plane for exploring Mount 積石 (Jishi) flew from Lanzhou to Chongqing at 8:00 am today. En route, it made a special detour to Mount 積石 (Jishi) to conduct angular measurements over the area east of Ani Maqing Township. Because thick clouds had covered that area during the exploration on the sixteenth, there was concern that it had been overlooked. Today, another high-altitude flight was made over it for two hours, confirming that all the mountain peaks were below 20,000 feet. Only one high mountain, named Gongga Mountain, was discovered along the border of Kang Province, at about 24,000 feet high, traditionally believed to be China's highest peak, but definitely not within the Mount 積石 (Jishi) area. Therefore, Chen Wenkuan solemnly announced today that he could definitively conclude that Mount 積石 (Jishi) has no peak higher than 20,000 feet. The plane arrived in Chengdu at 1:00 pm today and flew to Chongqing at 5:00 pm. It will return to Shanghai within a few days.

### The Eastern and Western Blocs Attach Great Importance; Italian Voters Vote Today; All Military Police Are Out to Maintain Order; Results Will Be Known in Three to Four Days

[Report from this newspaper] London, 17th broadcast: Rome dispatch, the Italian election, which has attracted worldwide attention, will be held tomorrow, and both the Eastern and Western blocs attach great importance to it. According to one observer, the Soviet Union's political intentions have no hope of success. It is expected that in this election, the Italian Communist Party will win 35% of the total votes, and Alcide De Gasperi of the Christian Democratic Party will most likely continue to serve as Prime Minister and form a coalition government, excluding the Communist Party. However, the official results of the election will not be revealed until Wednesday. According to the European Recovery Program, the United States has promised to provide Italy with considerable economic aid, but if the Communist Party wins, this aid will be automatically canceled.

[United Press Rome, 17th] The Italian general election will be held tomorrow. More than 300,000 armed military police are on alert overnight to ensure security during the election period, paying special attention to the squares of Milan and Rome. This election is the most important event in Europe since the beginning of the Cold War between the two major powers of the East and West. Whether Italy will remain in the ranks of Western countries or lean towards the communist countries under the influence of the Soviet Union can be determined by this election. The results of the House of Representatives election will not be revealed until Wednesday, and the results of the Senate election are expected to be revealed the next day. It is generally speculated that De Gasperi's Christian Democratic Party can get 35% of the votes, the People's Front led by the Communist Party can get 31% of the votes, and the remaining votes will be divided among other parties.

[Reuters Rome, 17th] The Italian people, who will participate in the vote on the 18th to determine the future destiny of Italy, are enjoying a day of political holiday before the vote today. The election campaigns of all parties officially ended at midnight on the 16th. What political figures are currently concerned about is the weather on Sunday. If the heavy rain that started on the night of the 16th does not stop until the 18th, it will be 方利 [fānglì: beneficial] to the Communist Party. This is because supporters of the Communist Party will actively vote regardless of the weather, while many other voters may be lazy to go out due to the rain and abstain. Christian Democratic Party leader De Gasperi is unwilling to speculate on the election results, but has told party cadres that he believes he will win a majority. He has refuted such rumors, and strongly stated that they will accept the will of the people.

[United Press Rome, 17th] Interior Minister Celba announced last night that the government will pay attention to the election at all times in the next two days. If freedom of voting is threatened, it will be dealt with severely, and even the election will be stopped.

[Public News Agency Rome, 17th] Emotionally strained Italian voters are hesitating on the divergent roads of the Communist Party and liberalism, not knowing which way to turn. They must elect 573 members of the House of Representatives and 237 members of the Senate who will rule Italy in the next two years. President De Gasperi ordered a three-day holiday during the election date so that workers could return to their hometown areas to vote. The order also allowed voters and candidates to enjoy a 30% discount on various travel expenses on the way back to their hometowns to vote. Railway workers said that all vehicles must be dispatched to cope with the thousands of passengers taking advantage of this unexpected five-day weekend holiday.

### Regarding the Return of the Free Territory of Trieste to Italy; The United States, Britain, and France Send Another Note to the Soviet Union; Hoping That All Relevant Countries Can Hold Preliminary Talks

[Reuters Washington, 16th] The United States today for the third time 諦 [dì: to inspect carefully] to the Soviet Union to consider returning the free zone of Trieste to Italy. The United States also stated its willingness to consider any suggestions made by the Soviet Union on this matter. U.S. Acting Secretary of State Lovett has sent a memorandum to the Soviet Ambassador to the United States in response to the Soviet Union's refusal to accept the procedures recommended by Britain, the United States, and France for the return of the free zone. The U.S. memorandum pointed out the U.S. intention to hold preliminary talks with the main relevant countries, before exchanging opinions with all relevant countries. The United States originally suggested that Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, and France should hold this preliminary meeting in Paris in May.

[Reuters London, 16th] The British Foreign Office has recently replied to the Soviet Union, pointing out that the Soviet Union deliberately raised procedural issues to evade the substantive issue of the proposal to return the free zone of Trieste to Italy. The British note denies the Soviet note's claim that it is undemocratic for the main relevant powers to meet to discuss this matter, and asks the Soviet Union to explain which procedure it agrees with. The British note also pointed out that the British government's suggestion to hold a preliminary meeting of the main relevant countries in Paris does not preclude any signatory to the Italian peace treaty from participating in the discussion on amending the Italian peace treaty. This preliminary meeting was originally only to inherit the procedures adopted when drafting the peace treaty. The peace treaty was first drafted by the Foreign Ministers' Conference, and then carefully reviewed by 21 countries. Therefore, the British government believes that the Soviet side's claim that convening a preliminary meeting violates democratic principles is unfounded. The British government would be happy to consider any procedural recommendations that the Soviet government can make as soon as possible to discuss the substantive issue of returning Trieste to Italy.

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 16th] The French Foreign Office today sent a note to the Soviet Union, asking the Soviet Union to accept the principle of returning Trieste to Italy. Its wording is roughly the same as that of the British and American notes.

### Using Enemy and Puppet Property to Stabilize Currency Value; Starting in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Region; National Bank Formally Requests Transfer from the Central Trust Bureau

[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the matter of transferring enemy and puppet property to serve as a currency stabilization fund, the National Bank is remaining silent on the matter, but is actually actively proceeding. The National Bank has formally requested the Central Trust Bureau to transfer enemy and puppet property with no property rights issues to the National Bank to serve as a fund to stabilize currency value. Those whose property rights are still in question will continue to be handled by the Central Trust Bureau. The complete measures are being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The National Bank also hopes that the Central Trust Bureau will evaluate all enemy and puppet property in US dollars before the 18th of this month, but due to practical difficulties, it may not be possible to complete the evaluation as scheduled. As for the scope of enemy and puppet property to be used, in principle, it is nationwide, but the property value is highest and the handling procedures are clearest in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions, so it will be carried out first in this region. According to last month's evaluation, the enemy and puppet property in this region is already over two trillion national currency.

According to relevant sources: Most of the enemy property that has not been sold is real estate and is already in use. In terms of its inherent value, it can strengthen the credit of legal tender, but selling it is another matter. First, there is the question of whether there are buyers. At the same time, how to relocate the occupants of the enemy property houses is also a problem. There are even more problems with reverse property, because after a general amnesty in the future, some traitorous owners will regain their freedom, and property right disputes may arise with their confiscated property.

### "Flying General" Divorce Case Opens; Presiding Judge Urges Reconciliation; Du Qin States She Would Rather Die Than Return to the Wang Family

[Our Report] The divorce case of "Flying General" Wang Zhuo and his wife Du Qin, in which Wang accused Du of adultery with Tan Yuehan and disrupting the family, was previously prosecuted by the District Procuratorate. The court held its first hearing yesterday morning. After Judge Zhong Xianda took his seat in the Second Criminal Court, the plaintiff, Wang Zhuo, 35 years old, from Chongming, stated that he married Du Qin in 1935 while serving as a flight instructor at the Jianqiao Aviation School in Hangzhou. The following year, they had a daughter, who is now 13 years old. In 1936, during the Guangdong Incident, he was stationed at Baiyun Airport in Guangzhou, and Du also went with him. In 1937, when the August 13th Shanghai War broke out, he served as the squadron leader of the 24th Pursuit Squadron of the Air Force. On October 6th, he was wounded in the air battle to defend the capital. Later, he was transferred to the Kunming Air Force Officer School as a senior pursuit instructor, concurrently serving as the commander of the Provisional Pursuit Squadron. In July 1939, while test-flying a Russian-style fighter plane, a mechanical failure caused the plane to crash, resulting in serious injuries. Although he received treatment, he lost sight in one eye,

lost sight in one eye and hearing in one ear, and suffered from nervous disorders. In February 1940, the government sent him to Hong Kong for treatment. In the autumn of the same year, due to the threat of enemy planes in Hong Kong, he was introduced by a friend to Tan Yuehan, an employee of the Central Wireless Radio Guilin Factory, and they evacuated to Shaoguan together on a small boat. Sharing the same boat day and night, Tan and Du gradually fell in love. Moreover, Tan was young and handsome, good at being gentle and considerate to women, and had no wife. Du gradually transferred her love to Tan, and when they parted in Shaoguan, Du even

covered her face and wept bitterly. In September 1940, upon arriving in Kunming, Du, having secretly agreed on the boat to use wireless military communication to exchange messages, ran away on December 18, 1940, and hired two lawyers, Zhu Shinan and Wang Zhenya, to publish a divorce notice in the newspaper. Later, after the persuasion of Wang Shuming, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, she returned home on January 10, 1941. By the winter of 1944, Du's passion for Tan was so intense that she took the opportunity to fly to Chongqing privately. At this time, Tan was working at the US Army News Office radio station. Wang discovered this and flew to Chongqing to find her and brought her back to Kunming again. However, the relationship between the couple had already broken down.

had already broken down. After the victory at the end of 1945, he led his family back to Shanghai. At this time, Tan had been waiting at the Xiang Sheng Hotel. Du ran away for the third time and published a statement in the newspaper declaring that she had separated from Wang, and secretly went to Tianjin to live with Tan. Du changed her name to Tan Daishan, also known as Tan Lixiu. Later, Tan was sent to the United States by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. On New Year's Day in 1948, Wang discovered that Du was living at A4, Fengye Building, Yingkou Road, Tianjin, and went to find her, bringing Du back home for the third time. In order to seek a permanent solution, he accused Tan of disrupting the family

disrupting the family, and because Du Qin defended Tan Yuehan, he also added Du as the second defendant. When Du Qin, who was in custody, was interrogated, Du, wearing an old blue cloth cheongsam, looking thin and haggard, stated: "On December 25, 1940, in Kunming, because of Wang's abuse, we had an agreement to divorce. After General Wang Shuming's mediation, we reconciled and tried to live together. At that time, Wang Zhuo personally wrote a note guaranteeing that he would not abuse me again in the future. However, Wang Zhuo later managed to destroy the note and became even more severe. He wouldn't allow me to eat during the day or sleep at night. He wouldn't allow me to cry or laugh, leaving me at a loss.

at a loss, and he even forced me to commit suicide with guns and knives. There were also various perverted behaviors, treating me worse than a prostitute, which I am unwilling to discuss further because it would be indecent." At this point, she burst into tears, weeping uncontrollably. Judge Zhong immediately advised her to return to her husband's home and attempt reconciliation. Du stated that she would rather die than return to the Wang family. Then, lawyer Chen Ziyu defended the defendant. At the end of the hearing, the court ordered that the case be adjourned for further review. Wang was dismissed, and Du was returned to custody.

### Sakhalin Returnee Representatives Voice Concerns to Social Affairs Bureau: Have Relatives and Friends in Taiwan; No Need for Relief

[Our Report] Yesterday, four representatives of Sakhalin returnees, Lu Changbang, Wang Shenzhai, Gao Fanglong, and Zheng Shouchuan, visited Yuan Wenzhang, the fourth director of the Social Affairs Bureau. According to their statements, they had lived in Japan for many years, were able to understand Japanese fluently, and were well-adapted to the lifestyle. Therefore, seeking a living in Taiwan was most suitable for them. Moreover, they all had familiar relatives and friends in Taiwan.

In reality, the returnees all had the ability to support themselves and did not need assistance from the local authorities. Director Yuan immediately stated that if the returnees had existing relatives and friends in Taiwan and did not need relief, the Social Affairs Bureau would consult with the Civil Affairs Bureau to include all the returnees in the city's Baojia system, issue identity cards, and then allow them to go to Taiwan as citizens.

Social Services Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation

### Meddling Parents Arrange Marriage, Childhood Sweethearts in Love

Lu Kunshan writes: I am a humble reader of your esteemed newspaper and have a matter to trouble you with. Last year, in the spring (when I was seventeen), I was introduced by a relative to study in Shanghai. Two months later, I received a letter from home saying that they had arranged a marriage for me. At the time, I was forced to come to Shanghai and did not yet have a proper job, so to avoid gossip, I did not refuse, although I was unwilling in my heart. Recently, I received another letter from home, preparing to hold the wedding tomorrow. However, I have long had a lover. We have been like siblings since childhood, but I never mentioned her to my parents. I now have several legal questions and would be grateful if you could answer them in "Social Services": (1) Is a marriage arranged by parents before I am of age, without my consent, valid? (2) If the other party refuses to dissolve the engagement, how can I deal with it? (3) After the engagement is dissolved, can I choose my own spouse and get married?

[Reply from American Lawyer Fan] (1) A marriage arranged by parents for a minor, without the minor's consent, is legally valid. (2) If the other party refuses to dissolve the engagement, you can refuse to marry. (3) After the engagement is dissolved, you can freely choose your spouse after reaching adulthood; otherwise, you should still obtain your parents' consent to be legal.

Telegram Q&A

### Answered by Shanghai Telegraph Bureau

(Question from traveler Lin Yifei) I frequently travel between Shanghai and Fuzhou for business. Because I do not have a representative office in Shanghai, I must personally come to your bureau's main business office to send telegrams, which is quite inconvenient. I propose that agency offices be established at important wharves to facilitate merchants and travelers.

(Answer) The Bureau has long been planning to establish agency offices at various wharves. We have now reached an agreement with the China Merchants Bureau to pilot business offices at the first, second, and third wharves to receive telegrams. You can send telegrams nearby, and we hope you will offer your valuable opinions to facilitate improvement.

(Question from Gonghexing, Jinling East Road) It is difficult to obtain discarded newspapers. Please remedy and improve this.

(Answer) Regarding the distribution of discarded newspapers, the Bureau has conducted a detailed survey. There is a great difference between the number of newspapers issued and the number received daily. Therefore, two discarded newspaper boxes have been set up in the main business office, with 4,000 discarded newspapers provided daily for users to take at any time. However, each time they are placed, all of them are taken by one user within a few minutes, defeating the purpose of the Bureau's box. Recently, to reduce the burden, whole discarded newspapers are charged 50,000 yuan per volume to cover costs, while single sheets are still provided free of charge.

Or comfort? Eternal longing? Or tenderness in the heart? No one can express the temptation that spring's West Lake holds in their hearts!

By the lake, the misty dawn, the lights in the depths of the willow forest, the vast sky, the long and silent shadow of the pagoda, have entrusted the memories of many tourists! Nature has endowed West Lake with too profound a charm, especially in the third month of late spring!

Lingering! May the beauty of West Lake always follow your memories! This is a precious memory! (Photo by our reporter Yu Chuang)

### Small City

— Bai Yong

Although I live in a big city, I always yearn for a small city. Perhaps this is in line with the so-called "petty bourgeoisie"? Even I can't explain it.

I really admire those giant merchants and great entrepreneurs who strategize within their tents. Their minds are calculating on gold notes all day long without fatigue. This is indeed a kind of cultivation. If you talk about patience, this can also be considered one of them. Recently, I saw a cartoon in a certain square publication depicting businessmen with large bellies and small brains, and writers with large heads and shrunken bellies. In fact, this is not right. Businessmen can be said to have the most developed brains, while writers are the ones without brains. We imitate a sentence from Mencius, "Did Yao and Shun not use their minds? They just didn't use them for farming!" "Do writers not use their minds? They just don't use them for money." But not using it for money is the same as not using the mind, because without money there is nothing! Rushing around in the big city, you can't get out of these forces' clutches. You don't have to walk on the sidewalk of a main road to be in danger of being run over by a big truck. Even if you sit behind closed doors, you can still be run over. Even if your body isn't run over, your spirit, sweat, and blood are always being exploited.

Tao Pengze's poem: "Mistakenly entered the dust net, thirty years have passed, for a long time in a cage, I can finally return to nature," this meaning is expressed very vividly. However, we do not have that thatched cottage in the mountains where we can look at the clouds and the sea, or watch the flying birds, mainly because the dust net we have entered is not deep enough, and we have not been able to rise from five pecks of rice to two thousand bushels to rent a villa in a scenic area. Therefore, Mr. Five Willows is still extremely extravagant in our eyes. Even if we are all petty bourgeois, he is still an outstanding one. With such a house with five willow trees in front of the door, mulberry and elm trees behind the house, peaches and plums in front of the house, dogs barking and geese honking, why bother with five pecks of rice? What's more, there are fifty acres of land for growing sorghum, where we can eat and drink old wine to our heart's content?

Consciously bourgeois, but in reality proletarian in terms of property, this year is truly rotten to the core. It's difficult to be a person either way, so I can only feel that it's good to escape from the sinful metropolis. If there really is a Shangri-La, I'm afraid that many more than just me would be "glad to go back!" Even those who criticize me may not be unmoved.

People are all somewhat self-inflated, but the big city only gives us oppression. Not only are the portly tycoons everyone's King Yama, but even the ten-story-plus high-rises that obscure the sky are a threat to us. Walking on Nanjing Road or Avenue Joffre, I often feel like I can't breathe. If the Bund didn't face the river, its sense of coercion on people would probably be even greater. In small cities, there are no such strange things. We can scoff at that kind of pseudo-Western-style building made of mud walls, as if it doesn't exist. The old-fashioned flat houses and ancient pavilions are so approachable and grand that we only feel broad and intimate living inside. Everything has a general warmth, even though the clapboards are not airtight with cement. Walking on the street, you can be uninhibited without having to look around. You always have two decent clothes. Wearing them can make the owner of the foreign goods store respect you. If it's a place that sells books and newspapers, they will talk to you, saying that you are from Shanghai or Nanjing, and you must have brought them some news, right? It would be even better if there was a market where the vegetables of the villagers and the floral foreign cloth and cheap cosmetics of the city people are exchanged. Zhang Zongzi, in "Xi Hu Xiang Shi" (West Lake Incense Market), wrote: "Gentlemen and ladies are no match for the rustic attire of village women; cauldrons and strange things are no match for the popularity of clay figures and bamboo horses," which quite captures a kind of earthy prosperity. Moreover, there are simply no pretentious elegant women or useless antique books and paintings in the countryside. It is those healthy and simple human relationships that give us some enlightenment and lessons. If there is still culture in China, it must be here, and not in dance halls and concert halls. This is a bit of national vitality—the little bit of vitality that has been sucked dry by the big city. Haven't you seen scholars advocating the return to the homeland theory? I can't say what theory it is, I just instinctively feel that small cities are better than big cities. What do you think?

### Fallen Flowers

— Ping Gong

I heard the sound of rain pattering on my pillow. I pushed open the paper window to see that the cherry blossoms in the courtyard had fallen almost completely, the fallen petals colorful like a carpet, and I remembered Yan Yuanxian's line, "But what can be done about the flowers falling?" According to Ouyang Xiu's "Gui Tian Lu": "Yan Yuanxian was famous for his writing. In his youth, he lived in wealth and honor, and his nature was bold and outstanding. Wherever he went, he extended hospitality to guests. Many famous scholars of the time came from his door. He was dismissed from the position of Vice Privy Councilor and became the Resident of Nanjing at the age of thirty-eight. Wang Qi and Zhang Kang were his most honored guests." Zhu Qi (Junyu) was known to Yuanxian because of the couplet "It seems like an old friend, the swallow returns." When Yuanxian was thirty-eight years old, it was the sixth year of the Tiansheng reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty, 1028 AD. Comparing it to Western history, it was thirty-eight years before the Norman Conquest of England (1066). At this time, did British writers have such beautiful prose as Yuanxian?

The works of the 17th-century English Metaphysical poets seem obscure, but when savored carefully, they feel lingering and profound. Besides Donne, Herrick is also not bad. Herrick's poem "To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time" ("Gather ye rose-buds...") and "Pluck the flower when it is in bloom..." have similar artistic conceptions, but are still many years behind.

Donne's poems are just like our country's ci poetry, using few strokes but unraveling silk from cocoons, leaving endless aftertaste. Donne is good at speaking of love, good at taking metaphors, and values imagery, all of which are similar to our country's ci poetry. However, our country's monks never so greatly violate the precept of flowery language, while Donne was indeed a monk.

This also made me think of people outside the world having affairs. I extremely love the beauty of the words in the "Thinking of the World" section of "Nie Hai Ji" (Record of Karmic Sea), writing about the little nun who can't bear the loneliness of the green lamp, her mind wandering like a wild horse, and then she feels that even the angry-eyed Vajra has amorous feelings, this emptiness is reality. However, "Going Down the Mountain" is vulgar and unbearable, and the writing is completely different from "Thinking of the World." I don't know why. As for Western literature about people outside the world having affairs, Browning's "Fra Lippo Lippi" is the best. Fra Lippo Lippi was indeed a real person, famous for his paintings, and Browning, hundreds of years later, used delicate and unrestrained strokes to uniquely write about a section where he was caught having an affair, which is not only excellent in style but also rich in musical beauty.

When I was in Kunming, I often went boating on Dianchi Lake with Professor Yan Bu Ye. One day, Professor Yan and I were both slightly drunk, and we argued greatly in the boat about the merits of Browning and Milton. Professor Yan, a famous poet in contemporary England, likes to drink, is unkempt, and reads extremely widely, never forgetting what he has read. That day, he recited more than a hundred lines of Milton's "Paradise Lost" in Dianchi Lake to show the excellence of Milton, because at that time I had just praised Browning for being affectionate and considered Milton to be stagnant. However, Professor Yan was indeed a very interesting person. If I praised Milton's beauty and belittled Browning, he would definitely bring out a large section of Browning to show off. Afterwards, I wrote a long article, still praising Browning and suppressing Milton as before, to present to Professor Yan, and he actually gave it a mistaken compliment. I heard from Mr. Hu Shi that Professor Yan has married and has returned to Peking University to teach. Today I saw in the newspaper that this great professor has resigned. Professor Yan can take a break to drink a few days, the old Beijing baijiu is not expensive and the quality is very good.

### Cooking

— Shuo Fu

Those who cook probably don't write articles, and those who write articles may not need to cook themselves. Therefore, I have a special feeling in my heart for writing this short essay. It can be said to be an ordinary and quite accidental little thing.

I remember that I only started learning to cook when I was twenty-nine years old. At that time, Mr. Chen and I lived together in a dormitory attached to a certain company. Downstairs was a certain kitchen, which was very convenient for ordering food, but it only provided dishes and no rice. At first, we always sent the tea boy to buy "white rice" at a certain Cantonese restaurant across the road. Later, the tea boy took leave to go back, and later his odd jobs were busier than before, so he couldn't spare the time. Mr. Chen and I bought a stove and a rice cooker together, and naturally we also bought some rice, and so we tried to cook rice ourselves.

The initial results were not good. Either it was not cooked, or it was because we were too impatient and kept opening the pot to look, the steam escaped, and as a result, the rice was burnt.

The amount of water added to the rice also has a certain dimension. If too much is added, it will naturally be too soft to be palatable. If too little is added, it will inevitably be too hard to swallow after cooking. Here is a trick: add water about the depth of the first joint of your index finger above the rice, and it will cook to a moderate softness.

In addition, it can be mentioned that the amount of rice placed in the pot is also a small problem. Usually, it is appropriate to fill about half the pot, because rice expands. If it is filled too full, after cooking, it will expand from the pot to the outside, and the pot itself will not be able to hold it. I once saw in a Hollywood comedy a certain female protagonist cooking rice on a gas stove. Presumably, too much rice was added. After cooking, it continued to pour out of the pot, making a mess all over the floor. If something like this really happened, it would naturally be very bad and also very embarrassing.

Recently, I no longer need to cook for myself. However, I am very fond of the health motto of often doing small chores. Occasionally, when I'm in the mood, I quite enjoy cooking as a pastime. Before I knew how to cook, it seemed like a difficult task. After cooking it once or twice, I felt that it was a very simple job. I think people in the city, after being tired of playing cards, dancing, and watching plays, can try cooking, which is also an interesting little experience. Bachelors can save a lot of expenses going to restaurants, which is not a bad extra benefit.

### Sea Red Mansion Poetry Record

— Xu Banmeng

Tooth Loose Chant

Lips broken still able to speak, teeth shaking cannot rely on strength, since coming across the sea, two teeth have fallen in five years. I have long known that the rigid must break, and that old age is approaching, not asking for the fine or the coarse, regardless of the sweet or the savory. It is like repaying a debt, one rising up after another. White rice fills my hungry belly, gold turns into遺矢 [missed arrow, waste]. Three meals three times to repay, connected to death. I think of the rich and powerful, indulging in extreme extravagance. The rich set up a banquet, enough for three months of bran. The smell of wine and meat comes from the vermillion gates, frozen bones fill the cold market. It is not that Heaven is unkind, nor that people are not ashamed, encountering karmic results, suffering and joy begin. My hair is just starting to turn gray, and my teeth are also decaying. I will let them fall out naturally, and not worry about moving or staying still. On a sunny spring day, the sun shines on me, as I chew and lick slowly.

Famous General

The great desert of Tianshan shook with heroic plans, the dazzling light of the sword shone on red skin, the mournful wind blew iron cavalry for thousands of miles, and the heavy snow pressed down on the flying fox at the third watch. The shadow of the tooth banner was dense with ice patterns, the treasure tent lights were dim, and courage was rough. Now that there is a famous general like Piao Yao, he will not let the brave Huns run through the customs.

### The Strangest Hotel in the World

— Sun He

The strangest hotel in the world is in the "Three No Management Zone" of Tianjin. In the north, unlike the south where people can sleep outdoors on winter nights without necessarily freezing to death, a type of hotel has emerged to protect people's lives, which is a 100% "hotel" dedicated to accommodation, and cannot be used during the day. Its facilities consist of a dilapidated large house with dozens of holes dug along the base of the walls, each capable of holding one person. When a traveler comes to stay, they invert their body into the hole, only exposing their head. A handyman stands nearby holding a shovel, waiting. Once the guest has entered the hole, they immediately shovel a shovel of sand to cover the guest's neck. It turns out that the basement level is cool in summer and warm in winter. In the basements of the north—of course, not stone but soil—you can not light the stove in winter without feeling cold. In this way, everything below the head is sealed in the hole, so at least you won't freeze to death. Humans are truly elastic animals. No matter how impoverished they are, they will think of a way. It is still impossible to sleep in North China with blankets and without lighting a fire for warmth. Therefore, there are old women who collect coal kernels, which shows that even if they have no way to buy coal, they cannot help but search for fuel in the garbage that people have dumped, even though it is as difficult as panning for gold.

In this way, everything can be saved. Beggars and coolies without beds, stoves, or bedding can still sleep soundly for one night. The fee per person, ten years ago, was one large copper coin, about a little less than one silver dollar.

### Free Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 14 - Freedom at Sea (129)

Zhu Zhai saw Xiao Bai's speech, which was too biased, and wanted to refute him, but because he was an elder, he did not dare to say it, and only repeatedly responded: "Yes! Yes! In a few days, I will go to my uncle's residence to see Qi Wan's letter." Xiao Bai said: "That's great, you should come to my house often in the future, and I will tell you about some operas. Just now I heard you sing that section of Yu Tang Chun, your voice is still very sweet and smooth, but your enunciation is still incorrect. I have time to slowly point you out. When Qi Wan comes back one day, she will be very happy to see your singing skills have improved." After Xiao Bai finished speaking, he laughed loudly. Zhu Zhai was made to laugh and cry by him. Xiao Bai then invited him to Laijin Yuxuan to drink tea. Zhu Zhai had no choice but to accompany him. He recalled when he first met Qi Wan, he was also drinking tea at Laijin Yuxuan. Today he came with Xiao Bai, but his beloved was thousands of miles away. Although he was perfunctory with Xiao Bai, he was very melancholy in his heart. Xiao Bai drank black tea and ate some snacks before leaving the garden with Zhu Zhai. Zhu Zhai watched Xiao Bai get in the car and leave, and he walked slowly along the side of the road, only thinking about Qi Wan. He took the letter that Xiao Bai gave him out of his pocket again and looked at it while walking, feeling only sad in his heart, feeling that Qi Wan was too wronged and too affectionate. She completely sacrificed for me. Xiao Bai misunderstood her psychology, which was too unreasonable. He didn't know what his old father would think after reading this letter. Even if the old man could express sympathy and understand her, what good would it do her? She said that she had no face to return to Beiping and see her colleagues again. How sad were these words? She also said that she hoped that her old father could permanently hide it from me and not let me know her hidden secrets, so as to avoid my suffering. How considerate and meticulous was her intention? She set up a night when people were quiet, and a hundred emotions gathered, and her tears wet her pillow. How tragic was this? Qi Wan, I really harmed you, I made you suffer, my conscience is going to pass, Zhu Zhai was holding the letter, reading while walking, his whole mind focused on the letter. Unexpectedly, just after passing the Sanzuomen, a large truck carrying many soldiers, speeding diagonally from the Public Security Street, rushed over suddenly. By the time the horn sounded, Zhu Zhai wanted to avoid it, but it was too late. The car rushed over and knocked him to the ground.

### The Price of a Spit

— Jing Ming

A friend who has just returned from Hong Kong told us that there, they are strictly enforcing the campaign to prohibit spitting in public. Anyone who is found to violate this rule (prohibition of spitting in public) in a public place or street will be taken to the police station and fined 100 Hong Kong dollars. This fine is considerable in any currency, especially when calculated in our Chinese legal tender. He said, that is why Hong Kong can effectively achieve not spitting in public.

From the most stringent places in the world dealing with spitting, we believe that Brooklyn, New York should be the most prominent. Over there, there are conspicuous notices posted at the entrance of every public bus. Anyone who is found to violate this rule (prohibition of spitting in public) on a public bus is legally liable to a fine of US$500, or one year in prison, or even both.

However, looking back at our Shanghai, the campaign to prohibit spitting in public has long been widespread, but in the end, we only hear the sound of footsteps on the stairs, but we don't see anyone coming down! (Translated from the Continental Daily)

### Little Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

Only in fierce and violent winds do we know which ships on the ocean are swaying? Which ones are about to sink? Which ones can sail steadily?…

A rose blooming in a warm room is unfortunate, because it has failed its beautiful thorns.

Water hyacinths on the water, gathering and scattering, will still gather after scattering, it's just a matter of time.

But if it leaves the water, then everything is over.

### Thunderstorm Skills Gathering

Upon seeing the news that Jinshan Temple had been reduced to ashes in a great fire, I was deeply shocked. This famous scenic spot and temple complex, also a palace of art, has also suffered such a calamity? The pen of history should record in bold letters: "On April 6th, in the thirty-seventh year of the Republic of China, the Jinshan Temple in Zhenjiang was destroyed by fire." This method of recording in historical texts the destruction of great architecture signifies more than just the damage to the object itself; it is truly a representation of the "heavenly warning to humanity." It is even more significant than the collapse of the Leifeng Pagoda in Hangzhou more than twenty years ago.

"Jin and Jiao stand eternally amidst the currents," "Jinshan appears as small as a fist"; the reason for its popularity is largely due to the "Jinshan Temple." Jinshan Temple also features the story of the monk Fahai, Xu Xuan, and the White Snake, a strange and beautiful tale of "love between immortals and mortals." Evolving from the West Lake to the Yangtze River, from mythology to drama, it even became the final commemorative performance co-starring Mei Lanfang and Li Shifang (Li encountered tragedy returning north to Qingdao after playing Xiaoqing in "Jinshan Temple" in Shanghai). This too is a page in the temple's mournful history.

The ancient relics of Jinshan Temple, such as Zhuge Liang's marching drum, Su Dongpo's jade belt, and Wen Zhengming's hand-scroll masterpieces, are all unharmed, which is a fortunate event amidst misfortune.

It is also heard that Abbot Taicang has vowed to rebuild the temple and restore it to its former glory in due time. Coincidentally, I read in the collected works of Yu Yue, the Elder of Quyuan, about famous temples in Suzhou and Hangzhou that were destroyed by the fires of the Taiping Rebellion. One was completely restored, while the other never regained its former appearance. The record of Baoji Temple in Suzhou states: The temple was built east of Huangtu Bridge in the prefectural city during the Tianjian era of the Liang Dynasty. During the Daoguang reign, Abbot Hengfeng renovated it, and although the framework was established, great disturbances repeatedly occurred, and the bright walls and red pillars were transformed into a desolate ruin. At the beginning of the Tongzhi reign, the three Wu regions were pacified, and Hengfeng, mindful of the sacred temple, carried out restorations, fulfilling his initial vow. The three gates stood towering, the main hall was vast and magnificent, and the bodhisattvas, arhats, and devas displayed various colors and forms. Success was achieved through perseverance. The rise and fall of a place truly depends on the people. The record of Jingci Temple in Hangzhou states: It was founded during the Wu-Yue period and renamed during the Shaoxing reign of the Song Dynasty, becoming the leading temple in the West Lake area. During the Xianfeng reign, it was destroyed by fire and became overgrown with weeds. During the Tongzhi reign, the monk Dayuan planned to restore it but ultimately failed. Later, Xuezhou moved from Shengyin Temple to preside over Jingci, building houses according to the terrain, high and low, creating a picturesque scene, but he ultimately failed to fully restore its former appearance. Thus, the rebuilding of famous temples can be successful or unsuccessful, swift or delayed. It depends on human effort. Abbot, take heart!

Legend has it that Emperor Ming and an old monk were together at Jinshan, overlooking the passing ships like shuttles, and the masts of the boats moored at the foot of the mountain like a forest, admiring the boundless magnificent scenery. The monk said that there were only two boats, one for "fame" and one for "profit," which truly encompasses everything and awakens many people. It is also said that when Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty made a southern tour to this place, he wanted to inscribe an imperial stele. After much deliberation with his accompanying literary officials, he came up with the four characters "Jiang Tian Yi Lan" (River and Sky, One View), which indeed exuded an imposing atmosphere. It was derived from the Tengwang Pavilion Preface, "Autumn waters share one color with the long sky," which can be said to be transforming the ancient into something new. According to reports, the Great Hero Hall and the Arhat Hall, with many sixteen-foot-tall golden statues and carved beams and painted pillars, were all consumed by the fire, but only the pagoda and the Fahai Cave were spared. It is unknown what fate awaits this stele pavilion. Furthermore, the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries, compiled in the early Qing Dynasty, was stored in seven pavilions: "Wenyuan," "Wensu," "Wenjin," "Wenyuan," "Wenhui," "Wenzong," and "Wenlan." Among them, the "Wenzong Pavilion" was located in Jinshan Temple, containing a total of 36,000 volumes, all in palace-style bindings, filling the buildings and extremely spectacular, but it has long been forgotten.

### Suggestions to the National Assembly Regarding Chinese Medicine

— Ding Jiwan

We, who have participated in the National Assembly, deeply understand the heavy responsibility regarding the rise and fall of Chinese medicine. We hereby propose four points for improving Chinese medicine to inform our fellow practitioners who are concerned.

1. Increase the authority of the Chinese Medicine Committee of the Ministry of Health, authorizing the committee to convene public associations of Chinese medicine practitioners from various provinces and cities at any time to decide on important medical and pharmaceutical administration and reform matters.

2. Based on the Chinese medicine specialty school curriculum promulgated by the ministry, establish national Chinese medicine specialty schools and subsidize excellent private Chinese medicine specialty schools to promote Chinese medicine.

3. Establish a national Chinese medicine research institute to collect effective medicines and formulas, refine and extract their essence, and develop the special effects of Chinese medicine.

4. Local health authorities should liaise with local public associations of Chinese medicine practitioners to establish public Chinese medicine hospitals and encourage the establishment of private Chinese medicine hospitals. Shen Zhongli

### The Relationship Between Headaches and Dizziness in Women and Anemia and Uterine Diseases

— Shen Zhongli

Headaches and dizziness in women are frequently seen, affecting nine out of ten people. Superficially, they may seem unrelated, but in reality, there are underlying illnesses. When they manifest, they are severe. Before medication can be taken, books say that women consider the liver to be innate. The liver stores blood, and when the blood is deficient, the liver's yang rises, leading to headaches and dizziness. Furthermore, women's nerves are inherently more sensitive than men's. Physiologically speaking, the distribution of nerves in the reproductive organs is linked to the brain and spinal cord, so diseases of the reproductive organs can cause stimulation of the brain nerves. Symptoms include solar headaches, eyebrow bone pain, nasal tip pain, and unilateral headaches, or dizziness and blurred vision. Severe cases may involve sudden collapse. As for the main causes of the disease, such as menstruation, pregnancy and amenorrhea, insomnia and palpitations, excessive leukorrhea, excessive sexual activity, postpartum imbalances, or severe uterine cancer, these symptoms are particularly pronounced. Some occur once a month, like dysmenorrhea, which is called periodic headache. Usually, attention should be paid to rest and opening up the mind. In terms of treatment, in addition to addressing the main symptoms, it is appropriate to nourish the blood and calm the liver, suppress latent yang, such as Shi Ciming's Zuo Mu Li Ci Shi Dai Mei Xi Li Bai Shao Gou Qi Shou Wu, and in severe cases, it is difficult to be effective without using antelope horn powder and Long Chi.

### The Past and Future of the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Hospital

During my clinical breaks, I often lament that the suffering of illness is unavoidable, and seeking medical treatment and taking medicine is a matter of course. However, I often see mild illnesses turning severe, and severe illnesses turning critical, or relapsing after illness, ultimately leading to death. Why is this? I think the reasons can be summarized in three points: Store employees, factory workers, and those living away from home, lonely and helpless, when they fall ill, they are bound to moan in bed, and when they look around, they are alone. There is a lack of people to serve the medicine stove and tea kettle. This is the lack of attentive care, which leads to the aggravation of the illness. This is the first reason. Ordinary citizens, if they suffer from infectious diseases, several family members are bound to infect each other one after another, occurring simultaneously. This is the poor environment, which leads to the aggravation of the illness. This is the second reason. The changes in the condition are unpredictable, and visits from relatives and friends are frequent. The noise often makes the patient feel uneasy, or there is no dietary restraint, and greasy and savory foods are consumed indiscriminately. This is the lack of common sense, which leads to the aggravation of the illness. This is the third reason. I have realized this, which is why the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Hospital was established.

In the autumn of the thirty-first year, 594 Beijing West Road, which is now the site of the hospital, was selected. Active planning and arrangements were made for everything, and on March 11 of the following year, it officially opened. A diagnosis department was added, and the News Daily Social Service column specially arranged for the hospital to admit free patients, so as to seek welfare for the society and fulfill the responsibilities of the hospital. In August of the thirty-sixth year, due to the increasing number of inpatients, the wards were insufficient, so additional wards were added to meet the needs of the environment and beautify the appearance of the hospital. Now, as we celebrate the fifth anniversary of the hospital's founding, looking back on the past, we dare not boast of our achievements, but we will exhaust our wisdom and devote our efforts to encourage ourselves in the future. We will only adhere to our original intentions and carry them through to the end. As for our wishes for the future, we can say that in terms of improvement, we must strive to integrate Chinese and Western medicine, learn from each other's strengths and discard their weaknesses, so that the diagnosis is accurate and the treatment is rapid. We hope that enlightened people from all walks of life and advanced colleagues will provide us with guidance and assistance. This is what our colleagues sincerely pray for.

### A Preview of the Exhibition of Historical Medical and Pharmaceutical Relics

— Chen Liang

Chinese medicine and pharmacy have a history of invention that predates any other country in the world. Its treasures are infinite, but we rarely explore them, and the essence cannot be expressed, which is deeply regrettable. Moreover, it has been passed down for thousands of years, and famous doctors have emerged in large numbers, which is enough for future generations to emulate. Now, the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Hospital is celebrating its fifth anniversary, and a special exhibition of historical medical and pharmaceutical relics is being held for three days. The intention is profound. I am honored to have been invited by President Cheng and to have the pleasure of a preview, which I am particularly happy about. The exhibition hall is divided into two parts. The first room is for medical and pharmaceutical relics, mostly the handwritings of famous doctors. The most valuable ones are the Tang Materia Medica, Song Wen Tianxiang's "Compassionate Children Scroll," Yuan Dynasty celebrities Shen You and others' scroll sending Shen Boxin's doctor Liang Hui Tang, Ming Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica, Qing Fu Qingzhu's annotation of Zixu Fu, Ye Tianshi's and Chen Lianfang's handwritten prescriptions, Lu Jiuzhi's legacy, He Hongfang's hand scroll, and modern Ding Ganren's, Xia Yingtang's, and Chao Songting's prescriptions, displaying no less than a hundred items, a dazzling array, a feast for the eyes. The other room is for the exhibition of medicines. Precious medicines such as antelope horn, rhinoceros horn, monkey dates, bezoar, and blood amber are displayed, and detailed analyses are provided to distinguish the genuine from the fake. I deeply feel that this event promotes the inherent national essence and medical and pharmaceutical culture, and the meaning is not shallow, and it is indeed a great sight to behold.

### The Strengths of Chinese Medicine Surgery

— Zhu Renkang

People generally believe that Western medicine relies on surgery, but they do not know that Chinese medicine surgery has many strengths. I can briefly mention some of them to inform the world. Chinese medicine surgery has methods of internal elimination. What is internal elimination? For example, when a carbuncle appears, Chinese medicine often applies special external plasters and prescribes internal medicines to dissipate it, which can often make the swelling and toxicity disappear without a trace, avoiding surgery and suppuration. Especially for chronic external diseases, such as wandering cellulitis that erupts here and collapses there, and scrofula with numerous lumps, Western medicine surgery is ineffective, and Chinese medicine relies on this method of internal elimination to gradually transform them. This is one of its strengths.

Furthermore, if carbuncles and back boils are not treated properly, there is a risk of internal spread, which Western medicine calls septicemia and pyemia. If Chinese medicine encounters such diseases, it applies topical poultices to draw out the toxins and prescribes internal medicines to lift and penetrate the swelling, so that the toxins are limited to one area, only allowing local suppuration and drainage of toxins, so that they do not spread and enlarge into internal organs, turning danger into safety. This is the second of its strengths.

In addition, there are many other strengths, but due to space limitations, I cannot discuss them in detail. I will continue to discuss them when I have time.
