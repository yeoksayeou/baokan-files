### He Yingqin Reports to the Executive Yuan: Distance Between North and South Army Groups Shrinking; Bandits Near Xuyi Defeated and Retreating After Fierce Suppression

[United Press, Nanjing, November 11th] According to reliable sources, United Press learned on November 11th: Minister of National Defense General He Yingqin reported to the Executive Yuan on the 11th that the National Army moving south from Xuzhou and north from Bengbu are gradually shortening the distance between them and are expected to join forces soon. Simultaneously, Huang Wei's army group is also expanding northward to meet the southward-bound National Army. Reliable sources also stated that Commander Qiu Qingquan telegraphed President Chiang, expressing his determination to break through the Communist army's obstruction. He told President Chiang, "There is no cause for anxiety regarding the position of this army group." However, he requested the dispatch of additional air force support to aid his southward offensive. It is also reported that Zhang Gan's army group, moving north from Henan to reinforce the southward-bound National Army, has reached the area between Guoyang and Mengcheng.

[United Press, Nanjing, November 11th] A senior staff officer of the National Army told reporters today that the key to the results of the great battle in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River lies in the rapid relief of the 12th Army Group by the 6th Army Group. The two major army groups are expected to join forces within 72 hours, 45 miles west of Bengbu (according to the United Press correspondent with the army in northern Anhui, the distance between the two army groups is only 25 miles). After the successful merging of forces, the 12th Army Group can take over the Huai River defense line, and the Bengbu front can be stabilized. The 12th Army Group is currently concentrated within a five-square-mile position, receiving supplies by air. They bravely broke through the encirclement, and the Communist army's situation is unsustainable. They are now attempting to cross the Huai River east of the Gang to outflank Bengbu, with the aim of containing the National Army.

[United Press, Northern Anhui Front, November 11th] The 6th Army Group's offensive is progressing smoothly, recovering many villages. Refugees are returning to their hometowns one after another, and every train heading to Cao Lao Ji is packed with returning refugees. Although their former residences are no longer recognizable, with only broken walls remaining, the villagers show no resentment. The great battle in the northern Anhui plains has lasted a month, with the National Army advancing and retreating three times.

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, November 11th] Bandits who infiltrated and gathered near Xuyi, attempting to nibble away at our territory, have suffered heavy casualties due to repeated fierce bombings by our air force. They are now redeploying troops from the Communist army's regional units in northern Jiangsu, near Huaiyin and Huai'an, and reorganizing them into a new 2nd Column, plotting to continue their southward infiltration at an opportune moment. In order to preempt the enemy, our army has dispatched units to suppress them. The bandits suffered heavy casualties and are now retreating.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, November 11th] The Jiangsu Provincial Security Command announced today that the Communist Huaihai Independent Brigade and the new 1st and 2nd Detachments of the Siyang, Shuyang, and Lianshui military sub-districts, totaling about ten thousand men, have infiltrated and gathered near Huaiyin. They have been intercepted by the National Army north of Banzha, and the two sides are still in a standoff.

[United Press, Nanjing, November 11th] The Navy Department announced today that it will continue to strengthen patrols on the Yangtze River, day and night. It has tightened control over inland river shipping in northern Jiangsu to prevent the infiltration of Communist bandits.

### Beijing-Shanghai慰勞 Delegation Flies Over the Front Line,慰勞ing Northern and Southern Army Groups;Morale Boosted After Talking to Huang and Du

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, November 11th] Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi, accompanied by Fang Zhi, Shao Hua, Xiao Ruoxu, and Zhang Wenbo, representatives of the慰勞 delegation from Shanghai, flew in a military P51292 special plane to the front lines of the Su-Beng battle to慰勞 the troops. Zhang Yujin, Hu Fo, Chiang Wei-kuo, and a reporter from the Central News Agency accompanied them. The special plane took off at 10:45 AM and safely returned to Bengbu at 12:50 PM. The two-hour and five-minute flight successfully completed the task of the Beijing-Shanghai慰勞 delegation. The special plane initially headed southeast to northwest, passing over the fertile and quiet fields on both sides of the Huai River, and then entered the northern Anhui front. At that time, Li Yannian's army group was cooperating with tanks to attack Baojiaji, west of Huoshenmiao, beginning the final assault to join forces with Huang Wei's army group. Smoke billowed from two villages near Baojiaji, which Chiang Wei-kuo pointed out as a signal of the National Army's successful attack. At 10:59 AM, the special plane approached the airspace above Shuangduiji. The ground, within a dozen miles around, was dotted with air-to-ground liaison symbols, which were the battlefields where Huang Wei's army group had contained Liu's main force for over ten days. Liu Zhi first spoke with Deputy Commander Huang, followed by Shao Hua and Fang Zhi, representing the people of Beijing and Shanghai, to express their high respect and present a list of慰勞 materials and letters. Commander Huang stated that both northern and southern positions were making progress, and the surrounding bandits would be eliminated, so everyone should rest assured. He also mentioned that the National Army in Shuangduiji was overjoyed to hear that the Beijing-Shanghai慰勞 delegation was visiting from the air, and their courage was greatly increased. Finally, Chiang Wei-kuo pointed out his tank unit, informing them that it was less than forty li from the northward-bound army group, and learned that the tanks had been cooperating with the National Army in offensive operations around Shuangduiji for several days, eliminating two to three thousand of Liu's bandits each day. The special plane circled over Shuangduiji for twenty minutes. From the window, the reporter looked down and saw dozens of villages centered around Shuangduiji, with crisscrossing communication trenches, forming a strong combat unit. At 11:10 AM, the special plane continued to fly north, passing through bandit-controlled areas, dropping "Letters from the Shanghai慰勞 Delegation to Compatriots Coerced into Joining the War by the Communist Bandits" and charts titled "Difficulties Faced by Lower-Level Communist Army Cadres," conducting a psychological warfare campaign against the bandits. At 10:35 AM, the special plane arrived in the airspace between Su County and Yongcheng, above the southward-bound army group led by General Du Yuming. Liu Zhi, Shao Hua, and Fang Zhi successively spoke with Deputy Commander-in-Chief Du, expressing their sincere慰勞 and dropping a list of慰勞 materials and letters. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Du replied: "We are deeply moved and grateful for the air慰勞 from the Beijing-Shanghai慰勞 delegation. We can only strive to achieve great victories to repay the kindness and goodwill of our compatriots in the rear." The special plane also circled in the airspace for twenty minutes. The reporter looked down with binoculars and saw parachutes fluttering in the wind, creating a magnificent scene of colorful blossoms. The ground troops looked up at the sky with joyful expressions as the gifts descended. At 12:10 PM, the special plane returned south along the Jinpu Railway, encountering a powerful air force formation along the way, diving and bombing in the Suixi Estuary area northwest of Su County, building a bridge for the southward-bound army group to join forces with Huang Wei's army group. After the special plane landed in Bengbu, everyone on board was extremely excited and confident in the future of the Su-Beng battle.

### Liu Zhi Thanks the慰勞 Delegation

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, November 11th] Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi recently sent a letter to the Beijing-Shanghai慰勞 delegation to express his gratitude, stating: "Suppressing bandits and saving the people is the natural duty of soldiers. The rebellion of the treacherous bandits is an international conspiracy. Therefore, suppressing the rebellion can also be called a national war, and victory requires the front and rear to be united as one."

The city's population has exceeded 200,000, and there is a severe housing shortage. On the surface, it is a scene of peace and tranquility, with no sense of being in a war zone. However, gentry and merchants have mostly moved west to Pingjin, and prices are high, causing the common people to complain. The Ping-Tang trains run safely, making the people here feel more calm.

### Under the Personal Command of Chiang Wei-kuo, Tanks Achieve a Surprise Victory, Capturing Two Villages in One Fell Swoop

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, November 10th] (Delayed) Central News Agency reporter Li Peng witnessed on the 10th, on the front line 50 li from Bengbu in northern Huai, that the tank unit personally commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Chiang Wei-kuo, the second son of the President, achieved a surprising victory. For the first time, they appeared on the Huai River battlefield, assisting the infantry in advancing six kilometers to the northwest, bringing the date of the meeting with Huang Wei's army group in the north even closer. Chiang's brave performance of leading by example gave the officers and soldiers on the front a great boost in morale. Today, the reporter accompanied the Hu Changqing unit of the National Army on the front as they advanced to Xiaoyijiawei. Chief of Staff Chiang Wei-kuo led the tank unit, commanded by Battalion Commander Hong Zhiming, to the second line at 3:00 AM. At 7:00 AM, after the tanks made contact with a certain division, they immediately set out, galloping across the vast fields, fiercely bombarding the bandit fortifications in the villages of Cuijia and Wangzhuang, half a li to the west. The infantry, crawling forward, then swarmed forward under the cover of artillery fire and dust. After an hour of fierce fighting, the two villages were captured. The infantry entered the villages to search, and some of the Communist army soldiers surrendered in a panic, abandoning their weapons, while the remnants took the opportunity to flee. The capture of the two villages has come to a successful conclusion.

### Churchill Asks in the House of Commons for British Government to Defend Hong Kong; Hong Kong Governor Studies the Problem of Overcrowding

[Agence France-Presse, London, November 10th] During a debate on foreign policy in the British House of Commons, Churchill asked the government to state its position on defending Hong Kong. Churchill said: "We should not forget the huge events happening in China. The spread of Chinese communism is progressing daily. I hope that the British Navy, Army, and Air Force should make adequate preparations to avoid any possible attack. I believe that this self-defense measure should be a matter of course." Deputy Foreign Secretary Mayhew spoke on behalf of the government, stating: "The government will maintain Britain's position in Hong Kong."

[British Information Services, London, November 11th] In the House of Commons on the 9th, in response to questions from the Colonial and Commonwealth Affairs Minister about the situation in Hong Kong, given the possibility of a large influx of refugees from mainland China, both ministers provided assurances that the relevant authorities were constantly reviewing the situation there. In response to a question about taking steps to provide essential services to prevent epidemics from occurring due to overcrowding, Colonial Undersecretary Rees-Williams replied that the government was hoping to avoid overcrowding, and the Governor of Hong Kong was currently studying all such issues to determine the extent to which refugee camps or other methods could meet environmental needs.

### Madame Chiang Explains Her Views on Aid to China; Truman Listens Sympathetically; Half-Hour Private Conversation After Tea Party

[United Press, Washington, November 10th] Madame Chiang met with President Truman for an hour this afternoon, but declined to tell reporters what they discussed. She met with the President at the Blair House, the temporary presidential residence, over tea. This was Madame Chiang's first opportunity to directly appeal to the US President for military and economic aid for President Chiang's Nationalist government. When Madame Chiang walked out of Blair House, reporters swarmed around her, but Madame Chiang said, "Sorry, I have no comments. The President will be speaking soon."

Later, the White House issued a statement saying, "The President said that Madame Chiang expressed her views, and he listened sympathetically." The spokesman continued: He did not know whether Truman would see Madame Chiang again. He said that they had tea from 5:00 PM to 5:30 PM, with Miss Margaret Truman pouring the tea. From 5:30 PM to 6:00 PM, the President and Madame Chiang then spoke alone in the President's study. When reporters pressed for more details, the spokesman said that this was all he was authorized to say.

When asked whether Madame Chiang's trip was successful and whether she would see Truman again, Madame Chiang still replied, "No comment." Madame Chiang left Blair House arm in arm with Mrs. Marshall. She also avoided answering the question of how much longer she planned to stay in the United States. Even during the visit, the government gave no indication that Madame Chiang would achieve anything. The meeting on the 10th may have ended Madame Chiang's appeal. She has met with Marshall twice, and there are now some signs that Madame Chiang may now reside in Washington until she returns home, as a prelude to a public appeal for assistance.

When Madame Chiang said she was "encouraged" after her second conversation with Marshall a week ago, officials suggested that this only meant that the United States was studying the China problem, and nothing more. Truman has made it clear in three statements over the past three years that he believes the solution to the China problem lies with the Chinese themselves. He emphasized the need for "peace and unity" in China and said that US aid would only supplement China's efforts. The US government is unwilling to undertake a large-scale aid to China program while attempting to support Western Europe against communism, and is also cautious not to fully support the Nationalist government in its current organizational state. Experts on China problems believe that any future plan will be extended until the military situation in China stabilizes and until Economic Cooperation Administration Director Hoffman personally investigates the situation in China and returns here. Hoffman said on the 9th when he passed through Turkey that he had been personally instructed by the President to investigate China's economic needs.

[United Press, Washington, November 11th] Foreign policy observers believed on the 11th that, as of now, Madame Chiang's mission to the United States had not been completed. They said that Madame Chiang had apparently not received guarantees of substantial aid to China. In her meeting with President Truman on the 10th and in her two previous conversations with Secretary of State Marshall, Madame Chiang had not received any major promises. Madame Chiang arrived here on November 1st, a total of eleven days ago.

### The Center of the Storm Has Shifted to China; the United States Should Approve Increased Aid Quickly

McKee Writes to Life Magazine

[Central News Agency, New York, November 10th] McKee, the National Treasurer of the United Nations American Associates (a well-known American businessman), recently stated: "All thoughtful Americans should urge the President and Congress to approve increased aid to China as soon as possible, including military equipment and military training personnel." In a letter to Life magazine, he recalled the words of US Secretary of State John Hay in 1899: "The center of the world storm has shifted to China. Those who understand China socially, politically, economically, and religiously hold the key to the next five hundred years of politics." The letter further stated: "Some point out that President Chiang is not cooperating with the United States, but in fact, the United States often imposes impossible conditions on Chiang, or attempts to attach such conditions." China and Europe are comparable in size and population, but aid to China is only one-ninth of the amount of aid to Europe.

### Sun Ke's Discharge Changed to Today; Will Exchange Views on US Aid with Hoffman

[Our Newspaper Report] Premier Sun Ke was originally scheduled to be discharged from the hospital at 5:00 PM yesterday, but now, because the wound has not fully healed, it has been changed to 9:00 AM this morning. During his stay in Shanghai, Premier Sun will exchange views with Hoffman on US aid matters and is expected to return to Nanjing before the 15th to meet with the President and discuss the formation of the cabinet. Whether he can formally take office on the 15th is still unknown. Zhang Zhizhong visited Sun at the hospital yesterday morning, leaving after talking for about an hour. Naval Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing also came to express his condolences. Liu Weizhi visited Sun in the afternoon for discussions. According to relevant sources, the discussions among the leaders on cabinet personnel and policies have made some progress, but the discussions in Shanghai are only for the exchange of views, and the final decision will still rest with the President. During his stay in Shanghai, Sun earnestly invited Zhang Qun, Chen Lifu, and Shao Lizi to participate in the new cabinet. Except for Shao, who has clearly stated that he is not prepared to participate, the others are still considering it. The new cabinet will take the form of a British wartime cabinet, composed of the heads of important ministries and promising ministers without portfolio, with cabinet members having equal status to the Premier, specializing in handling military and national affairs. Other general matters will still be handled by the Political Affairs Committee. As for streamlining institutions and eliminating redundant personnel, there have been preliminary discussions in the past, but due to practical difficulties, they may not be implemented immediately.

It is also reported that after arriving in Shanghai, Lei Zhen visited Zhang Junmai the day before yesterday to exchange views on the current situation, but the Democratic Socialist Party has decided not to participate in the Executive Yuan. The Youth Party is scheduled to hold a Central Standing Committee meeting in Shanghai today to discuss matters related to participating in the new cabinet.

### Hoffman Arrives in Shanghai; Will Hold a Press Conference Tomorrow Afternoon to Report on the Mission of This Trip; Will Stay in China for Four Days Before Returning to the United States

[Our Newspaper Report] Mr. Hoffman, Director of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 8:20 PM, via Bangkok, Hong Kong, and other places, on a Pan American flight from Europe. Mr. Li Que, Hoffman's special assistant, and Kimble, special assistant to the US State Department official Ban Liver, also came with him.

Hoffman was wearing a grass-green striped flannel suit and a blue twill overcoat, without a hat, and his hair was already graying, but he looked radiant and not at all tired. As he got off the plane and walked down the stairs, Yu Hongjun, Deputy Chairman of the Executive Yuan's US Aid Utilization Committee, accompanied by Yan Jiagan, a member of the committee, stepped forward to introduce themselves and shake hands. Yu expressed his sincere welcome on behalf of the Executive Yuan's US Aid Committee. Hoffman nodded and smiled in response, expressing his gratitude. Hoffman then walked out of the airport in order with those welcoming him at the scene, including Lappham, Director of the ECA branch here, Deputy Directors Griffin, Shen Xirui, and Zhang Peter.

When reporters stepped forward to ask him to make a brief statement, Hoffman smiled amiably and said, "I am very pleased to be able to come to China this time to inspect the work of the Economic Cooperation Administration branch." When a reporter asked how he would adjust the work of the ECA branch here, he smiled and pointed to Mr. Lappham, saying, "Mr. Lappham is actually my superior in this matter. The details should be asked of Mr. Lappham."

When Hoffman and others entered the waiting room, US Ambassador to China Stuart, US Consul General to Shanghai Cabot, Mayor Wu, and others had already arrived to welcome him and warmly shook hands and exchanged greetings. They all apologized to Hoffman for being late to the airport. The Pan American flight last night was scheduled to arrive at Longhua Airport at 8:40 PM, but it actually arrived twenty minutes earlier, causing the welcoming personnel who arrived on time to miss the rendezvous. After Hoffman had his passport and luggage inspected, he left the airport in the same car with Mr. and Mrs. Lappham and Griffin, staying temporarily at Lappham's residence that night. His assistants, Li Que and Kimble, stayed at the Yangzi International Hotel.

Hoffman will stay in China for four days and is scheduled to return to the United States on the 15th on a US military plane via Seoul, Tokyo, and other places.

Now, in order to make it clear to all sectors about the mission of this trip, Hoffman has scheduled a press conference at the American Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 PM on the 13th.

Hoffman is the person in charge of the US Economic Cooperation Administration's billions of dollars in aid for European and Asian reconstruction, and his task "is considered the largest of its kind in history." In 1942, Hoffman served as the honorary chairman of the United China Relief Association and launched a fundraising campaign for the Chinese people, which raised $10 million.

Hoffman made a clear statement about his mission to China before he set off from Washington on December 4: "My visit to China is to obtain impressions that can only be obtained through personal contact. The work of the resident branch in China has been underway for several months. If I can inspect the situation on the ground, I will have greater confidence and more understanding of the work that can be completed in China."

### Weekly Forum: The Spirit of the New Farmers' Association Law

— Wu Wangji

For thousands of years, Chinese farmers have lived a life of misery and oppression. Since the upsurge of the National Revolution in the fifteenth year shook the country, the oppressed farming masses, demanding their own liberation, have stood under the banner of the National Revolution, becoming a backbone force. Therefore, under the subjective pursuit and objective encouragement, strengthening farmers' organizations has become a unanimous demand nationwide. First, the regulations for the organization of farmers' associations were promulgated, and then the Farmers' Association Law was formulated by the Legislative Yuan. This can be said to be the beginning of farmers obtaining legal protection through the power of their own organizations. In the 32nd year, in order to strengthen the wartime organizational strength of farmers, modifications were made. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the world situation changed drastically, and farmers' organizations and agricultural transformation became a universal call. Some even said that the 20th century was the century of farmers. The Ministry of Social Affairs, aware of the domestic and international situation and the increasing prevalence of farmers' associations across the country, and the growing responsibility of the associations, deeply felt that the current Farmers' Association Law could no longer meet the needs of the present. Therefore, last year, they invited relevant agencies such as the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Land Administration, and the Farmers Bank to discuss revising the Farmers' Association Law. A draft amendment to the Farmers' Association Law was proposed and sent by the Executive Yuan to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation in June this year. From the first session to the second session of the Legislative Yuan, after a careful deliberation process, the preliminary review was conducted by the People's Organizations Group of the Social Affairs Committee, followed by the establishment of a special group by the Agricultural and Forestry and Water Conservancy Committee to conduct the initial review. After further review, the entire members of the Social Affairs Committee conducted multiple reviews. Finally, a joint review was conducted by the Social Affairs Committee and the Agricultural and Forestry and Water Conservancy Committee. The case went through more than ten large and small review meetings with repeated debates, which were extremely cautious and detailed. It was submitted to the plenary session of the Legislative Yuan before the new Farmers' Association Law was completed today.

Now, let's first talk about the spirit of the new Farmers' Association Law. The current Farmers' Association Law is a product of the tutelage period, and its legislative principles and objectives focus on supporting farmers, assisting the government or autonomous agencies, and seeking agricultural development. In fact, the farmers' associations during the tutelage period only achieved political misuse and manipulation, lacking the authenticity of their own organization. Farmers did not feel that the farmers' association was lovely, and the farmers' association lost the sympathy of the farmers. Even the responsibilities and powers were unclear, manipulated by a few people, only causing disputes. The reason for this is that the Farmers' Association Law itself still has many shortcomings; the biggest point is that it cannot stand on the farmers' position and seek benefits for the farmers. Therefore, since the promulgation and belonging of the Farmers' Association Law, except for the slightly complete organizational form of the Farmers' Association, in fact, the farmers are disconnected from the Farmers' Association, and the Farmers' Association in various places lacks independent, self-sufficient, self-motivated and real business performance. In severe cases, due to the complexity of the participating members, the farmers' association is just a decoration, or it is controlled and monopolized by non-farmers' association members, fundamentally losing the purpose of organizing the farmers' association. This revision of the Farmers' Association Law is completely symptomatic, based on the actual needs of farmers, and taking into account the current rural situation and the trend of the times. The Farmers' Association Law has been revised and supplemented separately, and the Farmers' Association is regarded as the Farmers' Association for farmers, defining its purpose and tasks, and striving to exert the effectiveness of the group. Therefore, strengthening and tightening the organization, determining the source of funding, resetting the organizational members, and coordinating the relevant business of the Farmers' Association are all aimed at enlightening farmers to move towards their own organized Farmers' Association to seek their due interests.

Here are some features of the new Farmers' Association Law:

(1) Clearly Defining the Tasks of the Farmers' Association The current Farmers' Association Law is divided into four chapters: general principles, establishment of membership staff meetings, disposition of funds, and supplementary provisions, with a total of 44 articles. The draft amendment of the Ministry of Social Affairs changed the "disposition" chapter to "supervision" and merged the articles into 40 articles. After deliberation by the Legislative Yuan, the original Article 4 on the tasks of the Farmers' Association was changed to a special chapter on tasks, totaling nine chapters, and the articles were merged into 39 articles. Since the task of the Farmers' Association is important, the original draft considered the Farmers' Association as an auxiliary organization and did not grant it independent tasks, which is obviously contrary to the fundamental spirit of the state's legislative organization of the Farmers' Association. A group without its own central tasks is no different from regarding the group as a decoration of the government, which is not the policy that should be adopted for farmers. The sixteen tasks stipulated in the original draft are both too broad and vague, making it impossible for the Farmers' Association to do anything or go anywhere. In order to clearly stipulate the tasks that the Farmers' Association should have and strengthen its activities to cooperate with the government, it is necessary to divide which are the tasks of the Farmers' Association itself, which are the tasks of the Farmers' Association to assist the government, and which can be jointly initiated with the government or other relevant agencies and groups. The original sixteen tasks in principle have been deleted and merged into eleven tasks, and a special chapter on the tasks of the Farmers' Association has been listed as Chapter 2, so that everyone can pay attention to the tasks of the Farmers' Association in the future.

(2) Adding the Purpose of the Farmers' Association The Farmers' Association is a group for farmers to seek self-help. Its central meaning is to strive for the due status and interests of farmers in politics, economy and society. To put it clearly, it is to obtain the rights and interests of farmers and to maintain and protect them with the power of the group. The original Article 1 of the amended Farmers' Association Law states that the purpose of the Farmers' Association is to promote farmers' knowledge and skills, increase production, improve farmers' lives, and develop the rural economy, with emphasis on developing agriculture. This is tantamount to regarding the Farmers' Association as a purely economic agricultural group, neglecting the political significance of the Farmers' Association. The Farmers' Association has the responsibility and obligation to protect the rights and interests of farmers conferred by the Constitution. Moreover, economic transformation requires political power, so the new Farmers' Association Law clearly restates the purpose of the Farmers' Association, adding the phrase "protecting the rights and interests of farmers" in Article 1 to indicate that the purpose of the Farmers' Association organization is not only to develop agriculture, but also to raise farmers' political awareness and protect their due status and rights and interests in politics and society.

(3) Strengthening the Organization of the Farmers' Association The Farmers' Association is a vertical group organization. Article 8 of the Farmers' Association Law stipulates that the two ministries of Social Affairs and Agriculture and Forestry may jointly convene a joint meeting of Farmers' Associations in various provinces and cities across the country, but there is no national united organization of Farmers' Associations. As a result, the Farmers' Associations across the country have lacked a national leadership center for the past 20 years. Even temporary joint meetings have not been held once to review the work. No wonder the farmers' movement is stagnant. In recent years, the Farmers' Associations in various provinces and cities have successively formed strong organizations to concentrate their power. A national Farmers' Association organization is indispensable, and the Farmers' Associations in various provinces and cities have also requested the Ministry of Social Affairs to add the organization of the National Federation of Farmers' Associations due to the needs of work. After deliberation by the Legislative Yuan, everyone believes that China is an agricultural country, and to promote the work of Farmers' Associations in various parts of the country, give full play to the power of farmers, and improve agricultural production, a national Farmers' Association organization is indispensable. Therefore, Article 5 of the amended draft clearly stipulates that the National Federation of Farmers' Associations should be changed to "National Farmers' Association." At the same time, the rural areas in townships and regions across the country are vast and the population is large. The original amendment draft only stipulated that the township Farmers' Association could be divided into groups, but due to the scattered and shallow nature of Chinese rural areas and the dispersed nature of farmers, it is not enough to improve the grassroots organization. The past emptiness and weakness of the Farmers' Association organization is also due to this. In addition, there are organizations of Bao Farmers' Associations in the pacification areas, so it is also stipulated that the township Farmers' Association may divide the township Farmers' Association branches or groups as needed to strengthen the grassroots organization, promote farmers' activities, and stipulate that each region should take the Farmers' Association as the center organization of farmers, and limit it to one Farmers' Association to avoid differences. In the future, there will be a national Farmers' Association leadership agency at the upper level, and the activities of the township branches will be strengthened at the lower level. This progress is truly a source of happiness for farmers across the country. (Continued on page 4)

### Legislative Yuan Finance and Economic Committee Holds Secret Meeting to Discuss Measures for Depositing and Exchanging Gold and Silver, Believing That the Current Focus Should Still Be on Reducing the Deficit

[Our Nanjing dispatch, 11th] The Legislative Yuan's Finance and Economic Committee held a secret meeting on the morning of the 11th to discuss the National Bank's methods for depositing and exchanging gold and silver. The committee members all agreed that the fundamental reason for the current bank runs in various places is still the imbalance in fiscal revenue and expenditure. If the government can tighten its spending and reduce issuance, there will be no such large amount of hot money. The policy of depositing and exchanging gold and silver can indeed absorb hot money and stabilize general prices, but the national treasury's reserves are not unlimited. This kind of stopgap measure cannot be relied upon for a long time. Therefore, reducing the fiscal deficit is the most important task at present. Regarding technical issues such as cracking down on scalpers and improving deposit and exchange methods, the committee members also put forward several suggestions, including: (1) limiting each person to one deposit and exchange based on their ID card, (2) restricting the amount of deposit and exchange, (3) entrusting the Bank of China, Communications Bank, Farmers Bank, and other banks and bureaus to handle the deposit and exchange at the same time to facilitate the general public, (4) paying civil servants and teachers half of their salaries in silver dollars for deposit and exchange. It was also decided to appoint committee members Bao Huaguo, Lu Yuwen, and Wu Yuechao to visit Finance Minister Xu in the afternoon to exchange opinions.

### Bank Runs and Scalping of Gold and Silver Are Due to Abnormal Psychology

Remarks by an Authoritative Source in the Ministry of Finance

[Our Nanjing dispatch, 11th] An authoritative source in the Ministry of Finance told reporters on the 11th that since the deposit and exchange of gold and silver began, bank runs and scalping by scalpers have occurred in many places. The reason is actually due to the abnormal psychology of the general public. The government controls a huge amount of gold and silver, with 5.5 million taels of gold and 100 million silver dollars. To exchange gold and silver at today's issuance rate, only one-fifth of the government's gold and silver reserves would be needed to recover all the gold yuan notes. In fact, not all gold yuan notes will be used for exchanging gold and silver. Therefore, no matter what, the government's gold and silver reserves will never be in danger of being exhausted. Since the Central Bank began handling the deposit and exchange of gold and silver, only more than 100,000 taels of gold and more than 100,000 silver dollars have been exchanged, which is less than one-tenth of the reserves and is insignificant. The bank run psychology is extremely abnormal. However, the government has already formulated prevention and crackdown measures for the scalping phenomenon caused by some exchange techniques, which will be implemented on the 13th. It is believed that after these improved measures are implemented, scalpers will be greatly reduced, and the public's exchange of gold and silver will gradually return to normal as the number of handling agencies increases.

[Our Nanjing dispatch, 11th] According to the Ministry of Food, regarding the relief of the grain shortage in various cities in North China, the Ministry of Food has prepared emergency measures and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation.

### US Eases Trade Restrictions on Yugoslavia

[United Press, Washington, 11th] The US government is carefully easing trade restrictions on Yugoslavia, so that Tito can receive some assistance in his struggle against Soviet oppression.

According to well-informed sources, the United States does not view Tito as a pro-capitalist anti-communist, but merely as an anti-capitalist critic of Western countries. However, since splitting with the Kremlin, Tito has acquired a special status that can be utilized by Western countries in the Cold War against the Soviet Union. According to the State Department's press office, the United States is certainly happy to engage in legitimate and peaceful trade with Yugoslavia and has always been interested in doing so. In fact, US policy supports the promotion of trade with the entire world. The United States has always exported non-strategic raw materials to Yugoslavia, and this policy remains unchanged.

### After Emergency Meeting in The Hague, Announcement: Negotiations with Indonesia Broken Off; Decision to Establish New Indonesian Federal Government

[United Press, The Hague, 11th] The Dutch Cabinet announced after holding an emergency meeting today that negotiations with Indonesia have broken down and has decided to establish a new Indonesian federal government.

However, no date has been set for when the provisional government will be established.

[United Press, The Hague, 10th] The Dutch Cabinet is reported to have decided today to establish an Indonesian federal provisional government by January 1 next year, without waiting for the participation of the Republic of Indonesia.

### Declaration of Human Rights: Approved by UN General Assembly; Stipulates That Everyone Has the Right to Freedom and Equality

[United Press, Paris, 10th] The UN General Assembly, ignoring the opposition of the Soviet bloc, passed the world's first Declaration of Human Rights today with 48 votes in favor, 0 against, and 8 abstentions, stipulating that everyone has the right to freedom and equality. The Soviet Union attempted to delay the vote at the last minute, but was unsuccessful. Before the vote, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky accused the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, saying that the United Kingdom, with the assistance of the United States, did everything possible to open the door for Hitler to attack the Soviet Union. The main culprits of World War II were the leaders of the United Kingdom and France, supported by the United States, with Hitler coming second. Daladier and Chamberlain had tried to strengthen Hitler's military and made various preparations for the German army's invasion of the East. The Munich Agreement was the root cause of leading the world to war. Pakistani representative Shafrullah stated that the Declaration of Human Rights stipulates that everyone has the freedom to change their religion, which seems to conflict with Islamic rules.

### Courageous Rescue, Admirable Heroism: Orange Ship Owner Returns to Shanghai from Huangyan; Association to Hold Reception

[Our Newspaper] During the Jiangya steamer's previous accident at sea, an orange ship owner named Zhang Hanting (see Gang) showed courage and rescued over 400 passengers, which was widely praised. Zhang's single name is Yin, and he is 67 years old. He is a provincial assemblyman from Zhejiang Province and resides at No. 11, Lane 212, Yaozhu Church Road in Shanghai. His eldest son, Zhang Ke Xiao, is currently the section chief of the Municipal Finance Bureau and has two grandchildren. He enjoys a happy family life. He often travels between Shanghai and Huangyan to transport tangerines for customers. On the day of the Jiangya steamer accident, he originally planned to sail from Shanghai to Huangyan in the morning, but due to social engagements with friends, he first instructed the ship to wait in Wusong. He took a car to Wusong in the evening to board the ship and went to bed after boarding. At that time, his cargo ship was a motor sailboat with a high speed, and its departure time was similar to that of the Jiangya steamer, so the two ships were not far apart after leaving the port. At around 8 PM, Zhang was awakened in his dream by the sailors, who said that there was a commotion nearby and something seemed to have happened. Zhang initially suspected a robbery, but then heard cries for help. After shining a flashlight, he realized that the Jiangya steamer had crashed. He immediately ordered the ship to approach and carry out rescue operations, and as a result, over 400 passengers were able to survive. Zhang returned to Shanghai from Huangyan yesterday. According to him, because his motor sailboat made a lot of noise that day, he did not hear the explosion of the Jiangya steamer. Before the Jiangya accident, he had originally loaded goods from Huangyan to Shanghai. On the way, he encountered wind and, for safety reasons, had thrown a large number of tangerines into the sea. On the day of the accident, his motor sailboat was not carrying tangerines, so he said that the story of abandoning tangerines to save people was not true. He also said that saving people in times of danger is what he should do, and that besides some damage to the cables and bow, there were no major losses. He humbly stated that he did not dare to accept the enthusiastic encouragement from all parties.

In addition, the Ningbo Association Jiangya Steamer Disaster Relief Association expressed special thanks to Zhang for his admirable heroism and planned to hold a tea party in his honor.

### Workers' Oil Rationing Price Determined: Calculated at One-Third of the Market Price

[Our Newspaper] The issue of oil rationing for workers in this city was previously discussed jointly by the Central Trust Bureau, the General Labor Union, and the People's Opinion Survey Committee. The Central Trust Bureau advocated that the price of rationed oil should be calculated by multiplying the oil price during the price control period by the cost of living index and then discounting it by 5%. If calculated in this way, it would exceed the market price, so no decision was made at that time. According to the Central Trust Bureau, this calculation method was approved by the Municipal Council, but after the Social Bureau inquired with the municipal government, there was no such proposal. The municipal government, the Social Bureau, and the Central Bank consulted and decided to distribute oil at two-thirds of the market price, one catty per person. The original plan was to distribute it on the 15th of this month, but it may be postponed due to the price change.

### Four Normal Schools - Face Risk of Famine - Jointly Submit Emergency Appeal to the Bureau of Education

[Reported by this newspaper] The principals of the Municipal Women's Normal School, Specialized Normal School, Xinlu Normal School, and Physical Education Specialized School jointly submitted an emergency appeal to the Bureau of Education yesterday, expressing concerns that the normal school students face the risk of famine. According to the appeal, the government only allocated 30 yuan per person for the normal school students' food expenses in November. As for the staple food expenses, the Food Distribution Committee has adjusted the price of allocated rice to 33 yuan, but these funds have not yet been allocated, preventing the schools from obtaining rice from the committee. Although the government allocated 30 yuan per person for non-staple food expenses in December, the actual minimum expenditure for firewood, oil, salt, and vegetable costs cannot be met with less than 60 yuan at current market prices. They earnestly request that the Municipal Government promptly approve and issue the staple food expenses after the rice price adjustment in November and the insufficient non-staple food expenses in December to maintain the normal school students' meals, otherwise, famine and class suspension will be inevitable. Furthermore, they also request that the staple food expenses for December be promptly allocated according to the Food Distribution Committee's allocated price to facilitate the process.

In addition to forwarding the request to the Municipal Government, the Bureau of Education intends to dispatch personnel to negotiate temporary emergency measures with the Food Distribution Committee.

### The Spirit of the New Farmers' Association Law (Continued) (Page Two)

(IV) Strengthening Farmers' Association Operations. The revised Farmers' Association Law provides for eleven items of farmers' association tasks. In addition to assisting in agricultural administration matters, most of them are operations that the farmers' association should do itself, especially improving and promoting agriculture and undertaking the transfer, lending and supervision of agricultural loans and land financial loans, initiating and guiding rural cooperative enterprises and simple agricultural warehouses, guiding and initiating rural side businesses, and adjusting and processing agricultural products, establishing demonstration farmland cooperative farms, and promoting other health, entertainment, welfare and relief undertakings, agricultural surveys and statistics, and even assisting in holding farmers' supplementary schools, agricultural exhibition halls, agricultural product exhibitions, etc. The matters to be promoted and reformed must closely cooperate with the relevant agricultural business organizations before they can be smoothly implemented, and they must also borrow the talents and resources of agricultural related agencies before they can be established. In the past, the Farmers' Association lacked close cooperation with agricultural institutions. Chapter IX of the revised Farmers' Association Law, which contains a chapter of supplementary rules, stipulates that farmers' associations may consult with local agricultural improvement, extension, finance, education and other relevant agencies to dispatch agricultural technicians to assist in guiding agricultural technology and other agricultural improvement work, with the intention of urging farmer groups and agricultural related institutions to become a whole on the same standing of transforming agriculture, and to cooperate in all aspects, and then the work of improving and promoting agriculture can be easily accepted by farmers, and agricultural finance and farmer education can also penetrate into the grassroots level of rural areas, so as not to commit the mistakes of the past of scratching the surface. At the same time, in order to establish the economic foundation of the Farmers' Association and strengthen the cohesion of its members, the grassroots organizations below the township and urban district farmers' associations may operate the same business according to the actual needs of farmers, and may transform the rural economy from their business, which is also easy to promote agricultural loans for real farmers. Therefore, Article 36 of Chapter I of the supplementary rules stipulates that township farmers' associations or urban district farmers' associations may guide the establishment of business groups according to the needs of members' business operations, so that agricultural products can be adjusted and processed by the farmers' own organizational forces, eliminating the exploitation and plunder of the middle class.

(V) Improving the Democratic Spirit. People have the freedom of assembly and association, which is a special right granted to them by the Constitution. During the period of political tutelage, the government adopted a strict regulatory policy for vocational groups. All organizations had to apply to the government for permission before they could prepare for and proceed. Now, in the constitutional period, in order to adapt to the spirit and requirements of democracy, the relationship between the government and people's organizations must be readjusted. The organization of farmers' associations only needs to meet the statutory number of people and procedures, report to the government for the record, and complete the registration procedures to obtain legal status, without the prior permission of the government. In other words, the right to organize groups in the future will be controlled by the people themselves, and the government cannot interfere, but it can use the power of guidance and supervision to support the groups to proceed along the right track and promote the development of the groups' businesses, so as to facilitate the implementation of government orders. This improvement of the democratic spirit will surely make it impossible for the stubborn and conservative gentry to obstruct the organization and activities of farmers' associations.

In summary, some of the above arguments have been put forward by the Ministry of Social Affairs in the draft amendment to the Farmers' Association Law, and most of them have been newly provided and supplemented by colleagues in the Legislative Yuan. The amendments to each article are based on the experience gained by the legislators who participated in the review and who are actually engaged in agriculture or the farmers' movement, and there are many unique and commendable points, so that the amended Farmers' Association Law can truly adapt to the realistic requirements of rural areas and farmers. However, laws cannot implement themselves. It is necessary to rely on the efforts of governments at all levels and people in the agricultural sector, and even more so on the efforts of the farmers themselves, so that sound and strong farmer groups can be created from good laws and good intentions, and the empty and formal farmers' associations of the past can be swept away, only knowing political operations, not knowing business leadership, or even being manipulated by ambitious people, so that the farmers' associations are in a state of paralysis. The communist bandits fully organized farmers' associations in their bandit areas and used the farmers' associations to destroy the vast rural areas. We must use legal means to improve the organization of farmers' associations, strengthen the activities of farmers' associations, and use the power of farmers' associations to transform agriculture and build rural areas. After the amended Farmers' Association Law is promulgated, whether the rights and interests of farmers can be guaranteed, whether farmer groups can increase day by day, and whether all rural compatriots can seek new life in group organizations, it depends on how hard the farmers work to support and implement the Farmers' Association Law, but it also depends on whether the government and agricultural related agencies can pay attention to the Farmers' Association Law and go to the countryside to engage in practical leadership work. Now that the amendment to the Farmers' Association Law has been completed, we earnestly hope that farmers will embark on the path of constitutional new life; we even more earnestly hope that farmers will take great strides into the Farmers' Association and seek more happiness for themselves; we especially urge comrades who are committed to the farmers' movement to catch up and strive for victory for the Farmers' Association Law, which is also to strive for brightness for Chinese farmers.

### Allegations of Gold Exchange Fraud - Supervisory Commission and Administrative Office Send Personnel to Investigate

[Reported by this newspaper] The Jiangsu and Zhejiang Supervisory Commission and Administrative Office noticed the reports in the city's newspapers yesterday about various alleged malpractices in the Central Bank's gold deposit and exchange operations and paid close attention to them. In the afternoon, special personnel were sent to investigate the truth.

If there are any illegal collusion, profit-making, or fraudulent activities, the Administrative Office will handle them according to law. The responsible personnel in charge of deposit and exchange operations in various banks should be held accountable, and we hope that all sectors will assist in providing all relevant information and clues to facilitate the investigation.

### Embezzlement Case of Executive Yuan Relief Administration (行總) Staff - Chiang Jen-lin Remanded for Third Trial

[Our Report] In the previous embezzlement case involving senior staff of the Executive Yuan Relief Administration, the District Court's initial trial sentenced the defendants Hou Ai-chang and Chiang Jen-lin to three years and six months of imprisonment each. Hou and Chiang, dissatisfied, applied to the High Court for retrial, which remanded the case to the District Court for a new trial. On August 20th of this year, the court ruled that Chiang Jen-lin had embezzled public property, upholding the original sentence of three years and six months of imprisonment, with deprivation of civil rights for four years. Hou Ai-chang was found not guilty. Subsequently, Chiang Jen-lin, still dissatisfied with the original verdict, again applied to the High Court for retrial. The High Court considered that the two previous trials had not fully investigated the part where Chiang Jen-lin was accused of misappropriating reserve funds during his tenure. Yesterday, the court once again remanded the case to the District Court for a new trial, and the District Court has appointed Judge Yeh Kuei-lin to schedule a trial.

### Abundant Arrivals, Sluggish Sales - Rice Market Sentiment Weak - Flour Slightly Up, Oil Market About to Recover Strongly

Rice prices are gradually declining. Due to the bearish report on the tin market the previous day, people generally felt weak. Arrivals are plentiful, and merchants are offering many samples. The market opened slightly lower by ten yuan in the morning, but sales remained sluggish, and prices weakened further in the afternoon. White japonica rice in the South Market was priced at 340 yuan, a decrease of 15 yuan. Thin indica rice and early rice each fell by 10 yuan, with some even lowering prices by 15 yuan. Prices in the North Market also declined by 10 yuan due to sluggish sales. Indica rice was down by 5 yuan, and polished rice was seeking lower prices by 10 yuan. Yesterday's arrivals in the South Market were 3397 piculs, and in the North Market, 8846 piculs.

Flour

Prices rose slightly because factories did not open the previous day, so dealers called for higher prices, and the market hovered upward steadily. Old Che flour initially traded at 144 yuan, once reaching 143 yuan, but closed at 146 yuan due to retail absorption, up 9 yuan. Bing Chuan flour closed at 136 yuan, a sharp increase of 7 yuan. Red Bee, Jian Cheng, and other miscellaneous brands of flour each rose by 3 to 4 yuan. Bran was initially flat but then rose, eventually seeing a squeeze of 2 yuan.

Grains

Prices rose and fell unevenly. Oil factories did not take yellow soybeans, and sales were limited. Hankou Jaza beans and Pinghu Dudu beans each fell by 5 yuan. Buckwheat from the North attracted interest, and trading turned active, with prices slightly firmer. Chongming buckwheat reached 170 yuan, an increase of 3 to 5 yuan. Selected green peas held steady, with limited supply. Red sorghum sales in the interior remained good, but supply was also abundant, and the market was said to be stable. Mung bean market sentiment was sluggish, and sesame also saw little change. Raw peanuts rose sharply by 40 to 50 yuan due to absorption from Guangdong merchants.

Edible Oil

Prices rose instead of falling. The market opened in the morning with factory soybean oil 50 yuan lower than the previous day due to the decline in rice prices. Subsequently, retail absorption suddenly occurred, and local traders followed suit, and prices soared. Soybean oil closed at 890 yuan, rebounding by 40 yuan. Rapeseed oil opened at 700 yuan and closed as high as 780 yuan, also up 30 yuan. Lucky Bucket raw oil closed again at 950 yuan, and small cart sesame oil was up 15 yuan. Soybean cake alone fell by 3 to 4 yuan.

[Our Report] A large batch of US-aided Siamese rice will arrive in Shanghai successively. The first China Merchants Bureau's Pei De transport, carrying 1,048 tons from Bangkok, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and is currently unloading at the second pier (i.e., Zhongzhan). The second Hai Huang vessel, loaded with 9,065 tons from Bangkok, is expected to arrive next Tuesday (the 14th).

### Taiwan Sugar is Advantageously Profitable

Yesterday, Taiwan Sugar's market saw fluctuating sentiment. Local merchants resumed interest, and dealers raised prices, causing the market to soar. No. 45 white sugar opened at 364 yuan, with special grade supply quickly selling out, resulting in chaotic bidding and a steady upward trend. Buying interest was uninterrupted. By the close, it still looked advantageously profitable, closing at 380 yuan, up 26 yuan. Coarse granulated sugar was 360 yuan, medium granulated sugar was 340 yuan, each up 50 yuan, with all other grades rising across the board.

### Tea Market Generally Stable

Yesterday, the tea market continued to trend sideways. Although dealers continued to try to raise prices, internal sales grades, which had risen sharply these days, were unable to rise further for the time being and were generally stable. As for export case tea, it was also difficult to make progress after export merchants' appetite eased. However, according to general observation, most are bullish on the future, analyzing the reasons as: (1) Due to the turbulent situation, goods are stuck at the source, and the inventory here is almost exhausted. (2) Foreign exchange transfer certificates are rising steadily, which is conducive to exports. (3) The doubling of public utility prices has a significant impact on reproduction costs, making price increases easier than price decreases.

### Weekend Money Market Loosens

Yesterday was the weekend, and the money market continued its easing trend. Interbank lending rates fluctuated between 25 and 30 yuan. The supply of funds from all parties was abundant, and remittances from other ports also poured in. The shortage of cash funds has also slightly improved, and interest on permanent loans has disappeared again.

### Cotton Yarn Buying Interest Strong - Cloth Prices Raised Sharply

With the unfolding of the cotton yarn price surge, sentiment was boosted, and holders were unanimously bullish. Yesterday, the market fell into a frenzy, with prices soaring and buyers scrambling to buy, while dealers had no intention of selling. 142-count Blue Phoenix yarn opened at 14,200 yuan and rose as high as 15,000 yuan at the close, resulting in a sharp increase of 2,400 yuan compared to the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix was at 12,700 yuan, a squeeze of 1,300 yuan. 32-count Blue Phoenix and Silver Moon each jumped by an average of 1,500 yuan. 21-count Double Horse spot goods initially opened at 11,700 yuan, once soaring to 13,200 yuan, before slightly falling back to 12,800 yuan at midday close, a squeeze of 1,400 yuan.

20-count Double Horse rose by 2,200 yuan, and other brands such as Golden Chicken and Heavenly Maiden also broke through the 10,000 yuan mark. 16-count Guangming and Heavenly Maiden both closed at 8,200 yuan, a squeeze of 1,200 yuan. 10-count Boy Scout was at 7,800 yuan, and De Li was at 5,900 yuan.

With the general loosening of the money market, and difficulties in lending for those with many orders, people's minds were set in motion. All parties seized the opportunity to absorb sharply, and short covering was particularly enthusiastic, with the situation showing considerable vigor, and prices rising sharply.

Top-grade fine cloth opened at 410 yuan, Four Gentlemen serge at 425 yuan. The market trend was based on premium quality midway, with few willing to sell, but those seeking goods were particularly enthusiastic, and prices advanced sharply towards the peak. Top-grade fine cloth closed at 440 yuan, up 50 yuan from the previous day.

Four Gentlemen yuan serge was at 460 yuan, a sharp jump of 52 yuan. Mid-grade fine cloth rose by 40 yuan, with Jin Yun Miao Wu yuan serge rising from 420 yuan to 440 yuan at the close, a squeeze of 50 yuan.

Four Gentlemen ten yuan direct trade initially opened at 450 yuan, once approaching the 500 yuan mark, but finally fell back to 475 yuan, a squeeze of 55 yuan. 190 Shilin factory goods ranged from 700 yuan to 850 yuan. In the afternoon, the market outside continued its upward trend, with reports that top-grade fine cloth and serge were both trading above the 500 yuan mark.

China Textile Distributes 12,000 Bolts of Cloth

Yesterday, China Textile distributed 14 types of cloth following the usual practice, totaling 306 sheets, selling a total of 12,600 bolts, 7,150 pounds of remnant cloth, and 860 bed sheets, totaling 484,150 yuan. The assessed prices were: Top-grade large 12-pound fine cloth 315 yuan, top-grade less than 12-pound fine cloth 350 yuan, special grade less than 12-pound fine cloth 270 yuan, Four Gentlemen yuan direct tribute crepe 465 yuan, Four Gentlemen yuan serge 440 yuan, Jumping Carp 999 large green serge 435 yuan, Rainbow Light fine yuan yarn direct tribute satin 400 yuan, Jumping Carp gray light twill 235 yuan, second-grade naphthol red cloth 400 yuan, second-grade printed direct crepe 380 yuan, second-grade printed serge 380 yuan, Four Gentlemen printed serge 410 yuan, second-grade gray cloth 185 yuan, sub-brand serge gray 270 yuan.

### Silk Soaring

Yesterday, the artificial silk market suddenly strengthened, with sentiment extraordinarily firm. Gold exchange speculative funds swept everywhere, and the prices of various goods outside the industry rose across the board. Speculation was rife in the market, and new buying surged, causing the market to rise in a straight line. 120-count Tianqiao initially opened at 11,500 yuan. Silk weaving companies' buying began, and prices rose by 500 yuan. More speculative buying pushed prices higher, with bids rising one after another. The market did not show any signs of fatigue until the close, finally closing at 12,500 yuan. Dongyang was at 12,800 yuan, a squeeze of 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

Raw silk prices continued to rise due to the surge in artificial silk prices. Foreign sales merchants have already satisfied their appetite, and prices have not improved, while dealers have raised prices, resulting in no transactions. Domestic sales D-grade 78 average whiteness factory silk was bid at 13,500 yuan to 14,000 yuan, and premium grade small lots were at 13,000 yuan to 13,500 yuan, a rise of 1,000 yuan, but transactions were scarce. Other Cheli thousand warp ordinary small lots, etc., rose by 500 yuan.

The silk and satin market also showed strength yesterday. Gauze and cloth prices rose sharply, and speculative funds from outside the industry poured in, with the most transactions in quilt covers. Huaqiang quilt covers were at 7,900 yuan, and Mei Ya was at 8,000 yuan. After opening, selling decreased and buying increased sharply, and new buying surged, causing bids to rise step by step. Huaqiang rose as high as 8,500 yuan, and Mei Ya was at 8,600 yuan. Subsequently, dealers dumped at high prices, and the market slightly softened, finally closing at 8,200 to 8,300 yuan, a squeeze of 1,000 yuan.

### Woolen Cloth Winter Sales Depressed

Recently, winter sales of woolen cloth have been depressed, with actual business quite lacking. Standard market prices have continued to weaken, with market prices lower than factory prices, and few buyers. The main reason for this is related to the current situation. At the same time, local merchants have turned from buying to selling, resulting in a loss of confidence among holders, and winter sales appear to be ending early.

### Commercial Briefs

Medicinal material prices have fluctuated, with pepper, costus root, Tianpian, Buddha's hand slices, frankincense, etc., all rising due to cheap sales from Guangdong merchants, who absorbed them. The various goods from Sichuan and Hankou are unevenly weak, and the goods from Guanbei have uniformly declined.

Tin foil prices have uniformly declined due to limited sales. Door sales of Lianerche four-grade still hold the original price. Fireworks are fluctuating, with no strength to rise.

With the foreign exchange certificate price frequently high, five-gall nuts have attracted the attention of exporters. Taijie sales have been sluggish due to the stagnation of leather factory absorption, so recent transactions can be said to be entirely driven by export companies. It is heard that the inventory of gall nuts is still abundant, and prices have therefore not fluctuated, but prices in the interior are very high, so shipping to Shanghai is still not cost-effective.

Your department's letter transferring the reader's attached letter of complaint has been approved. The Cleanliness Inspector General has replied as follows:

(1) The garbage in Jingxing Lane on Henan North Road has been cleared.

(2) The garbage bin in the eighteen-story apartment on Pushi Road is built inside the building, with a funnel connecting from the top floor to the bottom floor. Garbage flows down from above. When clearing the garbage, the mouth of the garbage bin is narrow, only allowing one person to enter and exit. There are two of these funnel-shaped garbage bins in the apartment, and the amount of garbage produced is too much to be cleared immediately. It must be gradually climbed out, first piled on the road, waiting for the truck to arrive and remove it, taking at most 30 minutes, never delayed to two or three hours.

### Sheep in the Northwest

— Special Correspondent in Lanzhou, This Newspaper, 6th

Sheep possess the most innate herd instinct. A flock can number close to a thousand, with only the largest ewe as their leader. Other sheep rarely act alone, so a shepherd only needs to bring one or two fierce dogs to protect his flock. He can easily manage these flocks, allowing them to freely graze, or even lie down for a nap, or sing mountain songs.

This kind of tranquil and peaceful primitive lifestyle has left these shepherds behind in the new century. For thousands of years, they have not improved their animal husbandry methods. Mating and breeding are left to nature, resulting in sheep breeds becoming increasingly complex, including Merinos, Mongolian breeds, Tibetan breeds, and Mongolian-Tibetan sheep (a hybrid of the two, differing greatly from their ancestors in body and fleece). There are also Tan sheep (a variant of Mongolian sheep). Besides these types of wool sheep, goat breeds are fewer due to their lower economic value compared to wool sheep.

In pastoral areas, sheep are practically a source of clothing and food. People eat mutton, butter (made from goat's milk), and drink sheep's milk. They wear sheepskin, burn sheep dung for warmth or fertilizer, use sheep wool to make felt yurts and tents for shelter from wind and rain, weave wool bags to store goods and grain, and make felt for mattresses. They even turn discarded sheepskins into rafts for transportation and craft sheep leg bones into pipes to smoke yellow tobacco. With such widespread and common applications, there is still surplus for export to other provinces or abroad.

There are two methods of

Shearing

hand-shearing and machine-shearing. In the Northwest, shepherds generally gather the sheep, tie their feet, and then shear them from chest to back. A skilled shearer can finish one sheep in ten minutes. With a shearing machine, the process takes only half the time, and the wool is neater. Therefore, the Northwest Wool Improvement Bureau is actively promoting shearing machines.

The amount of wool sheared varies by breed, with an average of two to three catties per sheep per year. The sheared wool is gathered into bundles by two people, tied, and sold. In the past, when merchants freely purchased for export, the shearing was crude, the wool was not cleaned afterward, and there was no packaging. Furthermore, because net wool prices were not implemented, producers often mixed sheep dung and sand into the wool bundles to increase weight, leading to mold and rot. After the war, the Trade Commission and the Reconstruction Corporation centrally purchased and sold wool (now handled by the Central Trust Bureau). Although there have been no major improvements, wool merchants have slightly improved their wool delivery process. Generally, they now unpack the wool bundles and sort them by color (white, black, mixed) and quality (large pieces, scraps), then sieve them through a wire mesh to remove sand and impurities. Finally, they use a baling press to pack the wool into cloth-covered bales and sew them shut for transportation.

The

Marketing and Transportation

of wool before the war involved foreign firms and trading houses setting up purchasing stations in various locations. Wool traders then bought in small quantities from producers at low prices and sold wholesale to the firms and houses. In the Amdo Tibetan area, there were also "Baka" organizations, similar to cooperatives, that centrally transported and sold wool, sometimes bartering goods like tea, cloth, oil, and salt. Although the state centrally purchased and sold wool during the war, intermediaries were still involved. Transportation routes were divided into domestic and foreign sales. Foreign sales concentrated in Lanzhou, Dihua, Ningxia, and Xi'an, then were transported to Hankou, Zhangjiakou, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Japan, and other locations. During the Anti-Japanese War, when Tianjin, Hankou, and other places fell, wool sales plummeted. At one point, wool was concentrated in Xingxing Gorge and transported to the Soviet Union via the Northwest International Route. Domestic sales involved wool from the Xiahe and Longdong regions, which was transported to neighboring Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces. Recently, some wool has been airlifted to Peiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hankou.

In the past, the wool exported from the Northwest was mainly carpet wool, which was of poor quality and unsuitable for weaving fine woolens. Since the establishment of the Northwest Wool Improvement Bureau, there have been concrete plans for improving and promoting everything from breeding and feeding to shearing and grading. The Northwest Animal Disease Prevention and Control Bureau researches the most common diseases in sheep, such as Maggot disease, and promotes prevention methods. However, the funding for these agencies is pitifully small. Currently, they can only conduct some simple research or small-scale promotion work. Although the staff has the skills, experience, and enthusiasm, their business development is limited by funding.

The animal husbandry industry is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood and is the primary task of developing the Northwest. It can no longer be delayed or ignored!
