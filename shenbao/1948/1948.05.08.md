### Inauguration of the Legislative Yuan Session This Morning; Number of Seats for the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties Still Under Negotiation; Zhang Qun's Continued Leadership of the Executive Yuan Reportedly Confirmed

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] As of 10:00 PM on the 7th, the total number of legislators registering for the first session of the Legislative Yuan under the Constitution reached 370, exceeding the legal total number of representatives by more than one-fifth. Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Lai Lianying, and others have also registered. It is almost certain that the legal assembly on the 8th will not be affected by other factors. The opening ceremony is scheduled for 10:00 AM. The Assembly Preparatory Office has issued notifications to all registered legislators and published a public announcement in the newspapers. Many heads of the National Government and diplomatic envoys in the capital will also be invited to attend the ceremony. Reporter seats are located upstairs. Old Legislative Yuan observers' passes or temporary entry/exit passes are required for seating. Legislators must also wear temporary attendance passes for entry and exit. The Preparatory Office has paid close attention to the inspection and guarding of the assembly venue, so there have been no unexpected troubles before the assembly.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch] The first session of the Legislative Yuan under the Constitution will convene independently at the National Assembly Hall at 10:00 AM on the 8th to declare its formal establishment. The order of the assembly opening ceremony is as follows: (1) Ceremony begins, (2) All stand at attention, (3) Chairman takes his seat (a temporary chairman is elected first), (4) Music plays, (5) National anthem is sung, (6) Bow three times to the national flag and the portrait of the Founding Father, (7) Chairman reports, (8) Chairman of the National Government delivers a speech, (9) Guests deliver speeches, (10) Music plays, (11) Ceremony concludes, (12) Visit the Mausoleum.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Regarding the candidates for Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, after Chen Lifu was nominated by the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, some Kuomintang legislators expressed their opinions. Their view is that if the Vice President is also from the South, it would disrupt the geographical balance. Therefore, Huang Yuren and others have promoted Fu Sinian for the position. However, the Central Committee believes that this matter has been decided and is not easy to change. It has been decided that Yu Youren will continue to serve as President of the Control Yuan, and Liu Zhe will continue to serve as Vice President. In this way, Southerners will lead the Legislative Yuan, and Northerners will lead the Control Yuan, which should still achieve a North-South balance. Regarding the selection of new cabinet members, the rumor that Zhang Qun will continue as Premier has been confirmed as of the evening of the 7th, while He Yingqin will focus on military affairs.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] On the eve of the Legislative Yuan assembly under the Constitution, the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties once again encountered complications regarding the number of seats for their elected legislators. The Kuomintang is eager to find a remedy to allow those nominated by the two parties who were not elected to participate in government administrative work and continue their cooperation. On the 7th, Zhang Qun, Lei Zhen, and others traveled separately to find a way to resolve the situation. At 9:00 PM, Zhang invited Kuomintang figures Chen Lifu, Lei Zhen, and others to his official residence in the Executive Yuan to discuss solutions for the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties' legislative candidates. At 11:00 PM, Lei first visited Xu Chuanlin and Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party, followed by Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party, for 20 minutes each. However, the matter has not reached the final stage. The Kuomintang is making every effort to find a way to address the number of legislative seats, while also hoping to continue cooperation with the two parties in administrative matters. Therefore, although this negotiation is taking place on the eve of the assembly, it is still in progress.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Mo Dehui visited Xu Chuanlin and others in the afternoon of the 7th to discuss the issue of the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties' participation in the Legislative Yuan and offered his opinions. He left for Shanghai by night train on the 7th, reportedly to visit Zhang Junmai and make some suggestions.

### Majority of US Congress Members Support Active Aid to China; Chennault Discusses Testimony in the US

[Our Dispatch] Flying Tiger General Chennault returned to Shanghai from the United States the day before yesterday with his wife, Ms. Anna Chennault. At 10:00 AM yesterday, he met with reporters at the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) on the Bund to report on his trip to the United States to provide the House Foreign Affairs Committee with his views on US aid to China and to answer various questions from reporters.

According to General Chennault, after he testified before the Foreign Affairs Committee, the majority of Congress members supported his opinion that US aid to China should be greater than the amount of $463.3 million. Chennault also said that he had private discussions with General Wedemeyer, General MacArthur, and Bullitt about aid to China, and they all supported aid to China and advocated not only economic aid but also military aid. However, he had never heard that General Marshall supported aid to China. The general reaction in the United States to Chennault's statement was very positive. When asked by a reporter whether US aid could continue to increase in the future, General Chennault replied, "I think it is possible. I don't believe this appropriation is the last one. But increasing aid to China requires a new bill to be passed in Congress. I have not heard of anyone planning to propose a bill on this matter."

Regarding the new head of the Sino-American Economic Cooperation Administration, Mr. Lapham, General Chennault said that he knew of Mr. Lapham's qualifications and believed that he was fully capable of this position, especially because he was very knowledgeable about Far Eastern issues, making him an excellent choice. However, Chennault had not heard of this matter in the United States until he arrived in Shanghai. Chennault said that aid to China should be used for postwar reconstruction, such as repairing the Yuehan Railway and reviving industry, but it should be focused in the lower Yellow River region. General Chennault also said that he believed that China's currency reform could be done, and that in Washington, someone had proposed that the United States lend China 600 million taels of silver for this purpose. However, this bill still needs to be formally proposed in Congress, and it is impossible to predict whether it will pass. Regarding Feng Yuxiang's situation in the United States, Chennault said that he had no status in the United States. Most Americans of high standing never pay attention to this person, and very few people interact with him. In general, the American people are not very interested in the situation in China and lack understanding. However, they all strongly advocate rejecting the Communist Party. American newspapers publish very little news about the situation in China, with the New York Times being the most sympathetic to China. The American people have a strong impression of corrupt Chinese government officials. In fact, the information they receive is often inaccurate. Chennault himself believes that there are very few corrupt officials. There are many wise officials that the American people do not know about. When asked who is the most capable administrative leader in China, Chennault laughed and said, "I have come into contact with many capable officials, but it is impossible to say who is the most capable." General Chennault also replied to a reporter's question, saying that he does not advocate that the US military join the National Army in fighting the Communist Army unless it is necessary. However, the US government is very willing to help China by sending personnel to train the National Army. He also believes that the strategic focus of the National Army used to be Shenyang, but he does not know the current situation. Finally, Chennault said that the United States itself is also facing economic difficulties, with its current debt reaching $260 billion (including public debt), and domestic taxes are very high. A foreign reporter immediately asked him whether the United States should sacrifice its own military spending to aid China. Chennault replied "No." The United States should train its own army while allocating some of its expenses to aid Europe and China.

### Our Navy Vessels Cruise the Seas; Capture Two Japanese Fishing Vessels

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Military News Agency reports: Our navy repair ship "Xingan," which recently returned from the United States, captured two Japanese fishing vessels, "Tokusei No. 1" and "Tokusei No. 2," at 6:00 PM on the 6th at 28 degrees North latitude and 122 degrees 30 minutes East longitude, for intruding into our fishing zone to fish. Our authorities had previously publicly announced that the navy would patrol and seize Japanese vessels that intruded into our fishing zones. It has been decided to handle these first two vessels caught seriously as a warning to others.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Regarding the issue of Japanese fishing vessels intruding into our fishing zones, although diplomatic channels have been used to negotiate with the Allied Headquarters for years, no solution has been reached. In order to ensure our fishing rights and effectively prevent Japanese fishing vessels from intruding into our fishing zones again, our authorities have ordered the coastal navy to seize any Japanese fishing vessels found intruding into our fishing zones in the future.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The request of the wartime relocated factories petitioning the Executive Yuan for preferential allocation of Japanese reparations materials has been approved at the temporary meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 7th.

### Team Leaders in Western Henan Suggest Strengthening Equipment

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Amid intense fighting in western Henan, our reporter recently met with Commander Ding Shuheng, a team leader from Deng County, in the capital. During the Deng County campaign last winter, Ding led the local people to defend the city for nine days and nights, killing and wounding 10,000 bandit troops, for which he was commended by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. During his attendance at the National Assembly in the capital this time, he also met with Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense several times and made many suggestions on the issue of establishing local armed forces. His view on the current war situation in western Henan is that the bandit troops are attempting to eliminate their worries before coveting Sichuan and then forcing their way to the Yangtze River line. The situation in western Henan is important. If the bandits unfortunately succeed, then the Qinling, Wudang, Tongbai, Dabie, and Funiu mountain areas in all four directions will have no peaceful days. The bandit troops have long resented the local team in western Henan, and the people's sentiment of self-defense is extremely high and they will never accept the bandit troops' "transformation." Currently, the offensive and defensive battles in Nanyang and other counties are being fought fiercely. However, the team's weapons and ammunition are all inferior. He has suggested to the authorities that in order to maintain the strategic area of western Henan and to encourage the people to defend their homeland, the government should not only provide rapid reinforcements to resolve the crisis, but should also actively support the teams, strengthen the militia in each county by equipping them according to the standards of the National Army, and provide ammunition at any time. The team's supplies should be used as military rations. In addition, after the situation has stabilized somewhat, a command agency for the people's bandit suppression and self-defense should be established in Henan Province to achieve significant results.

### End of Battle in Eastern Gansu; Bandit Casualties and Captures Exceed 10,000; Fierce Fighting in Western Henan Relieves Siege of Xichuan, Southern Henan

[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, July 7] The Xi'an Pacification Headquarters announced at 8:00 PM on July 7th: The battle in eastern Gansu is expected to conclude by the evening of the 7th or the morning of the 8th. Remnants of bandits, numbering over 20,000, who were routed by the National Army from areas including Bin County, Fengxiang, and Niangniangtai in Xiantai, fled into eastern Gansu. They were ambushed in Xiaojin Town (between Zhenyuan and Ning County) and heavily besieged. Fierce fighting has raged for two days and nights since the 5th, with the bandits suffering over half casualties and the remainder completely溃散. Preliminary estimates indicate 9,000 bandit casualties and 3,600 captured, along with countless military supplies, marking a major victory in bandit suppression in recent years. Sources close to Hu Zongnan revealed that General Hu had been listening to reports of victories from all sides in daily military briefings, his face beaming with joy. All newspapers in Xi'an rushed out extra editions on the night of July 7th.

[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, July 7] Between Zhenyuan and Jingchuan in eastern Gansu, the National Army has achieved substantial gains in recent days, capturing 3,600 bandits. Currently, the National Army is advancing north from Zhenyuan, Pingliang, Changwu, and Jingchuan, tightening the encirclement to annihilate Peng's bandits in eastern Gansu. North of Zhao Village Town in Qian County and south of the Jing River, there are over a thousand bandits. The National Army is also cooperating with local militias in their search and suppression efforts.

[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, July 7] Bandits who fled north from Hedaoxian and Dangyuan Townships to Tunzi Township (all three locations are between Zhenyuan and Jingchuan) in eastern Gansu have been mostly annihilated. The bandits located 15 kilometers west of Ning County have largely fled north along the main road into Xifeng Township in Qingyang County, and there is a possibility that they will continue north to attack Qingyang and Heshui County towns. Another smaller group has fled east into the county of Ning County.

[Special Dispatch from Hankou, July 7] The local militias in western Henan have inflicted heavy casualties on the bandits in recent days, achieving brilliant results. However, the bandits besieging Xichuan, Deng County, and Xixiakou are still launching fierce attacks with all their might, and the situation has not eased. In addition to sending reinforcements along different routes, we are also using air transport to supply the local militias.

[Special Dispatch from Kaifeng, July 7] The defense of Xichuan has reached its climax, with the local militias fighting valiantly amidst extreme hardship. Piles of bandit corpses have reached over 2,000, and the local militias have also suffered numerous casualties. Fierce fighting continues in the suburbs of Deng County.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, July 7] The siege of Xichuan in southern Henan was lifted on July 7th, with no trace of bandits within 15 li.

[Special Dispatch from Kaifeng, July 7] The communist bandits Chen Geng, Kong Congzhou, and Li Jingyi, along with units from Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi, totaling approximately 150,000 troops, are launching a large-scale offensive against the only strong fortress in the Central Plains (i.e., the counties of western Henan). Fierce fighting is ongoing as the local militias bravely resist. A telegram from the radio station in the mountains south of Xixiakou received by this reporter on the afternoon of the 7th stated: (1) The defense of Xixiakou entered a state of mixed combat on the afternoon of the 6th. The residents defending the north and south camps are determined to coexist or perish with the stronghold. Last night, there were more than five back-and-forth clashes, with bullets flying everywhere and a tragic scene.

[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, July 7] The National Army in Neixiang withdrew on the morning of the 6th.

[Special Dispatch from Xinyang, July 7] The bandits besieging Zhengyang launched a fierce attack throughout the night, repeatedly charging the city walls. The southeast and west gates were particularly intense. The defending troops fought valiantly, and elite units of the National Army rushed to their aid, arriving 11 li north of Zhengyang on the 7th. Zhengyang is expected to be relieved soon. Last night, this reporter visited Deputy Commander Zhu of the Fifth Pacification Zone to inquire about his views on the war situation. He replied with a smile: The fortifications in Nanyang are solid, the troops' morale is high, and their combat power is extremely strong. The bandits will not advance an inch without sacrificing 100,000 men.

Editorial

### The First Legislative Yuan Convenes on Its Own

The first Legislative Yuan elected by the people convened on its own in the capital this morning. This is another step forward for our country's politics towards democratic constitutionalism. Because the first National Assembly elected under the constitution has completed its basic task by electing the President and Vice President and adjourned on May 1st, the formation of a democratically elected government still awaits the President's nomination of a candidate for Premier, seeking the consent of the Legislative Yuan, before the new Premier can form a new democratically elected government and start afresh with the people. From now on, all decisions regarding domestic and foreign affairs, as well as central and local systems, will be implemented in accordance with the new constitution. At the same time, the Executive Yuan will be responsible to the Legislative Yuan for any measures taken. Therefore, the first Legislative Yuan's independent convening in the capital today is truly a watershed moment in the history of our country's democratic constitutionalism. Today, all 450 million compatriots across the country are looking towards the capital, anticipating the unfolding of a new politics and a new political atmosphere. Everyone is filled with joy, wishing success to the first Legislative Yuan's self-convening. We would very much like to take this opportunity to express our hopes for the first Legislative Yuan.

First, the first Legislative Yuan that convenes on its own today is of a completely different nature from the Legislative Yuan of the past. Not only are all legislators elected by the people, but the Legislative Yuan also enjoys supreme power under the constitution. The President's appointment of the Premier requires the consent of the Legislative Yuan, and the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan for important national decisions. Therefore, its status is equivalent to the House of Representatives in countries that adopt a responsible cabinet system. As our country's democratic politics are still in the learning stage, the responsibility borne by the legislators who represent the people in exercising legislative power is naturally even greater. Especially during this time of suppression, when the political, economic, military, and social crises are deepening, the Executive Yuan's policy guidelines should be viewed from a broader perspective, and there should be no petty emotions or personal biases that cause trouble within the Legislative Yuan, causing the political situation to fluctuate and deepening the current crisis.

Second, the essence of democratic constitutionalism emphasizes the spirit of the rule of law. Under democratic politics, all actions of both the government and the people must be based on the country's fundamental law (the constitution) and all ordinary laws. Our country's Article 175 of the Constitution is known to everyone and is simple and clear, which can serve as a code of conduct for the entire nation. However, since the establishment of the Legislative Yuan by the National Government, it is unknown how many laws have been formulated. Not to mention that ordinary people do not understand them clearly, even legislators and law enforcers do not know how many kinds there are. Some are changed in the morning and evening, and some are nominal and have no practical effect, which is equivalent to empty words and fundamentally loses the meaning of legislation. In fact, laws are not about quantity, but about being practical and easy to implement. Therefore, we hope that the first Legislative Yuan will adhere to the spirit of "simplifying laws," sort out the laws formulated by the previous Legislative Yuan, eliminate those that should be eliminated, and merge those that should be merged, so that the people can have a clear understanding of the country's laws and know what to follow. However, if the Legislative Yuan believes that it is necessary to add new laws, it should also pay attention to whether they are practical and easy to implement, so that the government and the people can jointly abide by them in order to implement the spirit of legislation.

Third, constitutional scholars unanimously acknowledge that democratic politics is public opinion politics. Legislators are elected by the people and represent the people in exercising legislative power. It can be said that they come from the people and deeply understand the sufferings of the people. However, we still hope that legislators who come from the people can often be among the people, so as not to be separated from the people. According to the precedents of democratic advanced countries such as Britain and the United States, various investigation committees are established in the House of Representatives. For certain special issues, they must first be investigated clearly before being submitted for discussion. At the same time, there are also organizations such as public opinion polls. Whenever a major issue arises, public opinion must first be solicited to know its support, and then decide on its own attitude. Therefore, we hope that after the Legislative Yuan convenes on its own, it should establish various investigation committees and public opinion polls within the Yuan. In addition to frequently holding meetings in the capital, all elected legislators should also go to the people to explore public opinion as the basis for their speeches and arguments.

Finally, regarding the election disputes of legislators, the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party have issued a joint statement on the eve of the Legislative Yuan's self-convening, on the one hand expressing their opposition to the central government's final decision to elect those with the most votes; on the other hand, they solemnly stated that if this issue cannot be resolved reasonably, the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party will not attend the Legislative Yuan. Judging from the situation, the election disputes of legislators will again cause political turmoil, which we cannot but find regrettable. Guaranteed quotas are originally of a political nature, and there is no legal basis for them, and they are not logical. No political party in any country can emphasize that voters vote for a candidate of a certain party, but since the Kuomintang has provided a promise, for the sake of morality, it should also allow more candidates from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party to be elected. The decision of the Political Affairs Conference to increase the number of seats was originally a remedial measure, but unfortunately it was not adopted by the Legislative Yuan, and the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party did not quite agree. The Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party should also understand the government's difficulty in coping with this factual difficulty. Now the government has decided to seek a reasonable solution through legal channels, and the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party have no reason to object. Mr. Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the Chinese Democratic Socialist Party, also talked about the value of the rule of law when he made a speech on the issue of the Vice President election. He said: "The so-called law is like a carpenter who has rules and regulations to make squares and circles. It cannot be mixed with emotions and feelings in the slightest. There must be a spirit of hanging the law at the gate of the country and not changing a single word. If you rely on your own likes and dislikes and arbitrarily manipulate it, you cannot talk about the rule of law." The Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party also issued a joint statement on April 26, saying that "maintaining the dignity of the constitution is an unavoidable duty." Therefore, the election disputes of legislators can only be resolved reasonably from the Law on the Election and Recall of Legislators. The Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party must not go to extremes and use "withdrawing from the Legislative Yuan" as blackmail. Fortunately, the Legislative Yuan is the highest legislative body of the country and can modify the Law on the Election and Recall of Legislators within the scope of legal principles, or increase the number of legislators, or establish other remedial measures in the by-elections, all of which are possible. Due to the urgency of the situation, the first Legislative Yuan must convene on its own today according to law. We hope that the elected legislators of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party can all participate at the same time and leave this issue to the new Legislative Yuan to consider it carefully in the long run and seek a reasonable solution in law. Looking back at the lessons learned from the election disputes of National Assembly representatives, forcibly ordering those with more votes to step down will inevitably cause unexpected disputes, and the problem itself cannot be reasonably resolved. We should pay special attention to this lesson.

### Active Construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway; Executive Yuan Allocates More Construction Funds; Ministry of Transportation Plans to Transfer Existing Equipment from the Guangdong-Hankou Railway

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, July 7] Deng Yiguang, Director of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Bureau, flew from Shanghai to Chongqing to discuss: The construction funds for the first half of the 37th year, totaling 100 billion, have been used up. The Executive Yuan has recently approved an increase to 200 billion, which can barely cope. The funding for the second half of the year must wait until the government is reorganized before a budget is set. The US aid for construction projects totals US$60 million, which is not included in the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. It is heard that after the Guangdong-Hankou Railway obtains US aid materials, the Ministry of Transportation intends to dismantle the rails, locomotives, and other equipment currently used on that line and transport them to Chongqing. However, this move is bound to affect the psychology of the people of Sichuan and does not meet their requirements for engineering standards. Therefore, it is still under consideration and no final decision has been made. According to Deputy Chief Engineer Hu Maokang, Feng Ban from the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was also sent to the United States, but no concrete results were negotiated. The equipment ordered in France before the war was stranded due to some reason and has not yet been signed. The biggest difficulties for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway today are materials and construction funds. Currently, 13 of the 68 major bridges along the entire line have been completed, including the Neijiang Bridge with a total length of seven holes and 350 meters, which is only waiting for the installation of steel beams. 15 of the 28 tunnels have been completed. The Guide River Bridge, Wang'erxi Bridge, and Shigaobridge, which recently started construction, are determined to be completed before the heavy rains in early July. In addition, the earthwork for approximately 130 kilometers of the entire line has been largely completed.

### Japanese Goods Make a Comeback, Flooding the Guangzhou Market; Domestic Products Have Suffered a Major Blow

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, July 6] Japanese goods are entering our country's market on a large scale in a blitzkrieg manner, and the frenzied situation is no different from that before the war.

These Japanese goods mostly impersonate British and American products and are favored by the general public. Due to the large-scale dumping of Japanese goods, domestic products have suffered a major blow.

### President Truman Announces to Reporters That the US is Promoting a Truce in the Holy Land, But Both Arabs and Jews Have Rejected the New Ceasefire Plan

He also said that the UK and the US have not directly negotiated on this matter, they can only seek to resolve this issue through the UN relationship. The United States is willing to provide special planes to the Jewish and Arab leaders to facilitate their meeting.

[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] Officials announced today that the US representative to the UN agency has proposed a new ceasefire plan to the Jews and Arabs, but it has been rejected.

### New Records Set in Athletics at the National Games: Taiwan and Beiping Score Most, All Top Four in Weightlifting Lightweight Class Break Games Records, Weather from Last Night's Wind and Rain May Impact Today's Events: Athletic Association to Decide Temporarily

[Our Report] Yesterday was the third day of the National Games. The preliminary and final rounds of men's and women's athletics continued, with three new records being set, one breaking the national record and two breaking the Games record: (1) In the women's high jump, Hebei's Yu Shusen cleared 1.40 meters, breaking Zhu Yaozhen's national record of 1.355 meters. Guangdong's Huang Zangping, who came in second with 1.33 meters, broke the Games record. (2) In the high hurdle final, Malaysia's Huang Liangquan finished in 16 seconds flat, breaking Lin Shaozhou's Games record of 16.2 seconds. (3) In the 1500-meter final, the Air Force's Yu Xiwei finished in 4 minutes and 17 seconds flat, breaking Zheng Sen's Games record of 4 minutes and 21.4 seconds. In the men's athletics scoring, Taiwanese athletes have taken the lead, ranking first in track events with 29 points, followed by Shanghai with 21 points. Next were Malaysia, the Navy, and the Air Force. In field events, the finals were not completed yesterday due to rain, so the scores have not increased or decreased. In women's athletics, Beiping City is currently in first place with 11 points, followed by Hebei with 8 points, Taiwan with 6 points, and Guangzhou with 5 points. Today is the third day of athletics, and the competition will be even more intense.

The ball games are gradually entering the tense stage. Football, men's and women's basketball, and men's volleyball have been narrowed down to the final eight teams, while women's volleyball has only the final four teams remaining. The consolation matches will all begin today. The first round of men's singles tennis and men's singles table tennis began yesterday and were successfully completed. The preliminary rounds of women's singles tennis and men's and women's softball are all scheduled to begin today.

The weightlifting competition has achieved particularly outstanding results. Yesterday was the second day, and the top four in the lightweight class and the top six in the light featherweight class all broke the previous Games records. Yesterday, the weather was gloomy, but the audience was still quite enthusiastic. The weather station has reported that the climate will change, so the reporting platform frequently urged the competition to be expedited. At 4:25 p.m., heavy rain suddenly fell, forcing the athletics and basketball competitions to be suspended. When the rain subsided slightly, the women's high jump and the men's 400-meter relay preliminary rounds were completed in the rain. The men's long jump and javelin finals had to be rescheduled for this afternoon, and the three men's basketball games that had not been completed were also rescheduled for today.

The schedule for today's Games was announced as usual last night by the Registration Group and will proceed according to the original program. The games that were not completed yesterday will be made up today. However, due to the wind and rain last night, whether the outdoor competitions can proceed today will be decided temporarily by the organizing committee.

### Overview of Men's Track Finals: Xu Tiande's Powerful Sprint; Huang Liangzheng's Correct Footwork; Chen Yinglang Sole Champion; Yu Xiwei Leads from Start to Finish

Men's 100-meter Final: The men's 100-meter final started after three false starts. Xu Tiande, having the earliest start, jumped out first and took the lead. Shanghai's Wang Songtao and Rong Chengbiu, along with Taiwan's famous general Xu Tong, advanced shoulder to shoulder, vying fiercely. Initially, Xu Tong held an advantage, but after running 50 meters, Wang Songtao vigorously surpassed him, and Rong Chengbiu followed closely behind. By this time, Xu Tong was gradually falling behind. Towards the final ten meters, Xu Tiande sprinted powerfully, breaking the white line first with a time of 11.1 seconds. Following him, Shanghai's Wang and Rong surpassed Xu Tong, ranking second and third respectively, with times around 11.2-11.3 seconds. Taiwan's Lin Qiujiang finished fifth, and Malaya's Yang Chunmei finished sixth. Guangdong's Zhong Yiyan and the Air Force's Leng Peishu were both eliminated.

1500-meter Final: The 1500-meter final started with twelve participants. Among those participating in this event were veteran Yu Xiwei and excellent athletes like Yang Liansheng and Liu Jingxian. As expected, the veteran Yu secured the championship. After starting for twenty meters, Yu Xiwei seized the inner lane and took the lead. At that time, Liaoning's Cao Daojian, the Navy's Liu Jingkun, and Zhejiang's Wu Jianhao, full of spirit, followed closely behind, while Hubei's famous general Yang Shusheng lingered in fifth or sixth place. Thus, after eight hundred meters, Yu Xiwei still led, but Yang Liansheng had already surpassed the others and began competing with Liu Jingxian for second place. Simultaneously, Henan's Fu Yanwen, the Army's Ni Qiu, and the Air Force's Xue Pengkui gradually emerged, while Cao Daojian and Wu Jianhao, who had initially followed closely behind the old Yu, fell behind due to insufficient stamina. Towards the final hundred meters, Hubei's Yang Liansheng had already surpassed Liu Jingkun, closely pursuing Yu Xiwei. In the approximately twenty-meter stretch in front of the West Command stage, Yang Liansheng was seen sprinting fiercely, competing fiercely alongside the old Yu. However, in the final five meters, Yu Xiwei ultimately broke the white line by a step, maintaining his past reputation. The time was four minutes and seventeen seconds, breaking Zheng Sen's previous meet record of four minutes and twenty-one seconds.

High Hurdles Final: In the men's ten high hurdles final, unsurprisingly, Malaya's Huang Liangzheng, who had the best time in the preliminary rounds, achieved the same time of exactly sixteen seconds in both the semi-finals and finals, breaking Lin Shaozhou's previous meet record of sixteen point two seconds. His hurdling posture was beautiful, his footwork correct and elastic, and his performance greatly improved compared to the preliminary rounds. Second place went to Beiping's Xu Baochen, only half a hurdle behind, and his time was also very good. Malaya's Chen Jinji was third, Taiwan's Lai Youde was fourth, Shanghai's Li Zhenzhong lacked stamina in the later stages and finished fifth, and Guangdong's Sun Jun finished sixth. The high hurdles final was also one of yesterday's best-performing events.

1500-meter Medley Relay Final: In the 1500-meter medley relay final, Taiwan once again took the sole lead. Baton passes were calculated with double weight, adding fourteen points to Taiwan's score, further boosting their momentum. The Shanghai team fought hard and finished second, about ten meters behind. Eight teams participated in the final. In the first leg, the Navy's Wang Jingwu took the lead, followed by Shanghai's Tan Qing and Taiwan's Xu Tong. In the second leg, Shanghai's Rong Chengbiu broke away, followed by Taiwan's Zhang Xingxian and the Navy's Wang Dezhi. In the third leg, the 400-meter leg, Taiwan's Chen Wenyan surpassed Shanghai's Lin Canran, widening the distance, while the Navy's Zhang Zhiqing remained in third place. In the final 800-meter leg, Taiwan's general Chen Yinglang sped away, sealing the victory. Shanghai's Wu Zhonghai was no match for him, finishing fifteen meters behind in second place. Third place went to the Navy, fourth to Gansu, fifth to the police, and sixth to the Air Force, with a time of three minutes, thirty-four and three-fifths seconds.

### Women's High Jump Final: Wu Shusen Takes the Top Spot, Breaking the National Record with 1.40 Meters

[Report from this newspaper] The women's high jump final began yesterday afternoon at approximately 2:00 PM. A total of twenty-seven athletes actually participated in the preliminary rounds. As the competition neared its end, a heavy downpour suddenly began. After half an hour, the rain gradually subsided, and the competition continued. As predicted by this newspaper yesterday, Hebei's Wu Shusen, with an outstanding performance of 1.40 meters, broke Zhu Tianzhen's previous national record of 1.355 meters and won the championship. Second place went to Guangdong's Huang Zangping, who also broke Tang Ruirong's previous meet record of 1.320 meters with a height of 1.33 meters. Achieving such excellent results in rainy weather is truly commendable.

Yesterday's women's high jump started at 1.20 meters, which everyone cleared easily. Subsequently, the bar was gradually raised to 1.27 meters, which fewer than ten people were able to clear. When the bar was raised to 1.30 meters, Wu Shusen, Huang Zangping, and Wang Honglan all cleared it on their first attempt. Lin Zhenji and Chen Yingzhen cleared it on their second attempt. Qiu Yuejiao failed to clear it in three attempts and finished last among the six finalists. When the bar was raised to 1.33 meters, only Wu Shusen and Huang Zangping cleared it with ease. The remaining competitors were eliminated one after another. When the bar was raised to 1.36 meters, Wu Shusen cleared it on her first attempt, while Huang Zangping failed to clear it in three attempts and was eliminated. At this point, only Wu Shusen remained to jump for the record. When the bar was raised again to 1.40 meters, against the wind and light rain, Wu Shusen failed in two attempts. Finally, summoning all her strength, she cleared it on her third attempt, with some distance to spare between her and the bar. When the bar was raised again to 1.42 meters, Wu Shusen failed in two attempts. On her third attempt, she had already run close to the bar, but likely due to a miscalculation of her steps, she charged forward but did not jump. Thus, her highest recorded height was 1.40 meters. In yesterday's women's high jump, the results for third, fourth, and fifth place were all 1.30 meters. The final rankings were determined based on the number of successful clearances. Fourth place went to Nanjing's Lin Zhenji, who was short and agile. During her jumps, she used the Western roll style, which was accurate and aesthetically pleasing. Unfortunately, she injured her hip when jumping 1.24 meters, limiting her highest result to 1.30 meters. Given time, her future potential is limitless. Here is a summary of the rankings and results for the top six finishers:

First place: Wu Shusen (Hebei) 1.40 meters (breaks the national record)

Second place: Huang Zangping (Guangdong) 1.33 meters (breaks the meet record)

Third place: Wang Hongguan (Qingdao) 1.30 meters

Fourth place: Lin Zhenji (Beijing) 1.30 meters

Fifth place: Chen Yingzhen (Shanghai) 1.30 meters

Sixth place: Qiu Yuejiao (Taiwan) 1.27 meters

### Javelin and Long Jump Finals Halted Yesterday Due to Rain

Air Force's Wang Rui Holds Advantage in Javelin

[Report from this newspaper] In yesterday's men's field events, there were finals for both javelin and long jump. The javelin competition started at 3:00 PM, and the long jump competition started at 3:40 PM. However, both events were halted midway due to rain. After several throws in the javelin competition, no one managed to exceed the 50-meter mark. Only six or seven people exceeded 40 meters. Among them, the Air Force's Wang Rui held a relative advantage, with a result of approximately 46 meters. The Navy's Wang Xuewu was still recovering from a waist injury, and his performance was unlikely to improve. He stated that due to recent lack of practice and the softness of the javelin shafts used at the meet, his results were significantly affected. The Navy's Wang Rui also shared the same sentiment regarding the softness of the javelin shafts. Wang Rui is tall and strong, and only twenty-five years old. He has achieved a javelin throw of 51.2 meters, but he believes that the overcast weather yesterday afternoon also negatively impacted his true potential.

### All-China Games Track and Field Results to Serve as World Games Selection Criteria; Athletics and Swimming Selection Committee Resolves

[Report from this newspaper] The Athletics and Swimming Selection Committee of the All-China Sports Federation for the World Games held a meeting at 11:00 AM yesterday at the Jiangwan Stadium to discuss matters related to the selection of athletes for track and field and swimming. Committee members Xu Minghui, Zhu Chongming, Xia Xiang, Jiang Xiangqing, and Zhang Huanlong attended. Dong Shouqun was present as an observer. Xu Minhhui chaired the meeting, and Xiang took notes.

### Football Battles Enter Tense Phase; Yesterday's Six Matches Yield One Upset: Dalian Overwhelms Guangdong; Hong Kong, Zhejiang, Army, Shanghai, and Malaya All Emerge Victorious; Elimination Matches Begin Today

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday was the third day of the football competition. There were two matches each at the Athletics Field and Yiyuan in the morning, and two matches at Yiyuan in the afternoon. The results saw Hong Kong defeat the Navy 2-1, Zhejiang defeat the Air Force 2-1, Dalian defeat Guangdong 3-1, the Army easily defeat Guizhou 7-0, Malaya defeat Nanjing 5-1, and Shanghai defeat Hubei 3-1. Except for Dalian's particularly spirited performance in overpowering Guangdong in extra time, the rest were within this newspaper's predictions yesterday. The weather was very good yesterday morning, and there were many spectators at both the Athletics Field and Yiyuan. However, a sudden downpour occurred after 4:00 PM, and the Army and Guizhou teams completed their match in the heavy rain. During the Guangdong vs. Dalian match, Dalian questioned the referee Zhang Le regarding the shortening of the second half, accusing him of favoring Guangdong. After an explanation, the dispute was quickly resolved.

After three days of intense competition involving twenty-one football teams, thirteen teams will gradually enter the elimination matches starting today. The final eight teams in the championship are: Malaya, Army, Dalian, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Zhejiang, Siam, and Police. Starting tomorrow, they will be divided into four groups to compete for the final four spots.

### Hong Kong vs. Navy Thriller Most Exciting; Navy Loses in Extra Time

The Hong Kong vs. Navy match was the most exciting event in yesterday's football competition. Both sides were strong and played with great tension. Less than two minutes after the kickoff at 9:00 AM, the Navy's Xie Jinchuan scored a goal, breaking the Hong Kong goal. The Hong Kong team, having defeated the World Games representative team 3-1, felt greatly renowned. Unexpectedly, they were at a disadvantage from the start and fought back vigorously. The two teams engaged in fierce back-and-forth battles. The Navy's Qiang Yuanzhi and Jing Guilin were injured and left the field, but they continued to defend strongly. The Hong Kong team achieved nothing in the first half. In the second half, the two teams fought even more fiercely. Two minutes before the end of the match, Hong Kong's left winger Li Shuoyou lightly tapped the ball from the halfway line, and the ball slowly rolled into the net, resulting in a tie. After extra time, the Hong Kong team got a corner kick opportunity. Li Shuoyou passed to Zhong Canguang, who headed the ball into the goal. The Hong Kong team came from behind, defeating the Navy 2-1.

### Disturbances After Zhejiang Air Force Match

The Zhejiang-Air Force soccer match began at eleven o'clock, with both sides evenly matched and the situation extremely tense. In the first half, Wu Binghao of the Zhejiang team scored a goal, and in the second half, Zhang Jie of the Zhejiang team scored another. Although the Air Force team responded with one goal, they ultimately lost by a one-goal difference. Moments after the end of the match, the Air Force team players began chasing and attacking the Zhejiang team players. Lu Bingsheng, the center forward of the Zhejiang team, was seriously injured in the beating and was rushed to the Fourth Municipal Hospital for treatment, where he remained under care until late in the evening. The Zhejiang team members were extremely indignant at being humiliated for no reason and intended to confront the Air Force team as a group. The spectators in the stands also shouted and cheered, causing temporary chaos. Fortunately, Hu Weike, the leader of the Air Force team, and the security team arrived in time to mediate, and both sides then turned to off-field negotiations.

Yesterday's lineups for both sides were as follows:

Zhejiang

Liao Xiong

Yue Renxiao Xu Shengyuan

Lu Bingsheng Wu Jiabang Cao Zengming

Wu Binghao Su Ziwen Zhang Jie Lu Qingxiang Lin Dianyi

Malaya Lightly Defeats Nanjing

The match between Malaya and Nanjing started at 9:00 AM at Yiyuan. The Nanjing team was mainly composed of strong athletes from National Central University, supplemented by good players from Jinling University and other strong teams in the capital. Their defense was good, but their midfield and forward lines were too weak. The Malaya team gathered elites from the South Seas. Although their main players were scattered, their strength was not as great as when they conquered Shanghai before, but they were still not a match for the capital's setup. After the match began, the game was a melee until the 20th minute when Li Sida kicked the ball into the net, putting Malaya ahead 1-0. In the 25th minute, Nanjing's Hu Zhisui crossed the ball, and Guo Bingyan got a perfect header, tying the score in the first half at 1-1.

After switching sides, Malaya headed in a goal after more than nine minutes, making it 2-1. In the 22nd minute, Huang Jinbi lofted a high ball from midfield, and with the momentum of the ball and the wind, it hit the bullseye. Three minutes later, Liang Kaiming took a corner kick, and in the ensuing chaos, the Nanjing defender accidentally scored an own goal. In the last minute, Li Sixuan once again outmaneuvered the defense, went in alone, and added another goal, resulting in a 5-1 victory for Malaya.

Shanghai Forces Back Victory Over Hubei

The match between Shanghai and Hubei started at 10:30 AM. The first half ended 0-0. After the refreshment break, Lin Gen left his defense far out, and Ji Haitao took advantage of the opening, rushing straight in and scoring the first goal. Shanghai launched a desperate counterattack. You Liang lightly passed to Long Hai on the right wing. Long Hai lobbed the ball to Ah Sun, who unleashed a powerful kick, breaking through the goal and tying the score. The morale of the Shanghai team soared, and they scored two goals in quick succession within three minutes, reversing the defeat. In the 27th minute, Long Hai broke through the defense and went straight in, but Fan Xiwu tripped him, violating the rules and resulting in a penalty kick. Li Yao officiated, and with a powerful kick, the ball went into the goal. The Shanghai team ultimately won 3-1.

Dalian Defeats Guangzhou

At 2:00 PM, Guangdong played against Dalian. Less than five minutes into the game, Dalian took the lead with a goal. Guangdong counterattacked and, after a series of attacks, in the tenth minute Dalian conceded a penalty, which was taken by Hou Chengtuo, who scored with one kick. However, the Guangdong forward was offside, and Zhang Le ordered a retake. He Chi still shot to the left corner, hitting the bullseye again and forcing a tie. For the next sixty minutes, neither side could score. In the seventh minute of extra time, Yan Chengkuan scored with a powerful shot from 30 yards out, demoralizing the Lingnan athletes. Before the end of the match, Chengkuan lobbed another goal into the empty net, leading to a 3-1 defeat for Guangzhou.

Army Heavily Defeats Guizhou

The match between the Army and Guizhou was held in torrential rain. Guizhou's strength was weak and could not withstand the attack. The Army freely entered Guizhou's defense and scored at will, winning 7-0.

### Football Match Incident: Zhejiang Team Withdraws Protest, Navy Reports Events

[Report from our newspaper] Two incidents occurred during yesterday's football match:

(1) After the Air Force team beat Zhejiang team player Lu Bingsheng, the Zhejiang provincial delegation expressed their determination to lodge a protest with the organizing committee. Upon learning of this, Hu Weike, the leader of the Air Force team, personally went to the Zhejiang team to formally apologize to the entire team. He stated that before the match, he had repeatedly warned the Air Force team to strictly abide by the rules, but the incident still occurred. He expressed regret over the team members' disregard for sportsmanship and the injury to the Zhejiang team player, and he was willing to bear all medical expenses. Li Chaoqing, the leader of the Zhejiang team, recognizing Hu's acceptance of responsibility and his efforts to quell the situation, found his sincerity touching and immediately expressed his willingness to withdraw the protest. However, to uphold the spirit of the games, he will submit a separate report to the organizing committee.

(2) In the Navy vs. Hong Kong match, the Hong Kong team won 2-1. According to the Navy team representative, the Navy team scored one goal in the first half. In the second half, more than three minutes had passed beyond the regulated time, but referee He Chunhui did not announce the end of the game. The Hong Kong team scored at that moment, leading to an extension of the game and an erroneous result. The Navy team believed that the referee was at fault. To comply with the spirit of the games, they obeyed the decision during the match, but after the match, they reported the facts to the chief football referee and lodged a protest.

### Four Female High Jumpers: Champion Wu Shulin Trains Runs Every Day, Runner-Up Huang Zangping Fell But Continued To Chase, Third-Place Wang Honglan Is Elegant and Refined, Fourth-Place Lin Zhenji's Buttocks Don't Touch the Bar

— Our Reporter Hong Xucai

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, Wu Shusen from Beiping broke the national record in the women's high jump, and Huang Zangping from Guangdong and Guangzhou broke the National Games record. Both are rare talents. Champion Wu Shusen grew up in Beiping and is currently a freshman majoring in physical education at Beiping Normal University. She says that among all sports, she likes high jump the most. Her past achievement was 1.365 meters, winning the championship at the Beiping Xiannongtan Sports Field trials. This time participating in the National Games, she reached 1.40 meters, setting a new personal record. She practices 50-meter sprints every morning to increase her explosiveness. For many years, she has never stopped, so today's amazing achievements were not easily obtained. When it was her turn to high jump in the finals, she was very calm, running very slowly, and when she got to the bar, she jumped lightly and easily over it. Miss Wu is twenty years old, taller than average, dresses plainly, and wears a pair of glasses, probably a good student.

Runner-up Huang Zangping has a moderate build, an oval face, and very developed calves, with an exceptionally smart appearance. In addition to participating in the high jump and winning second place, she also participated in the women's low hurdles race. Yesterday, when starting the jump, Miss Huang was very fast, leading all the way. She thought she could score, but unfortunately, she accidentally fell when jumping the last hurdle. She quickly got up and chased, but it was already too late. Miss Huang had to wait for the next opportunity to try again.

The third-place high jumper, Wang Honglan, is twenty-nine years old, tall and slender, with two braids, looking elegant and refined. She is a top student at Qingdao Wende Girls' High School and this is her first time in Shanghai. She said that she has only been high jumping for a year, participating in two city games, encouraged by her teacher. The first time she won third place, and then became interested in high jump. The second time she participated, she won the championship. It seems that Miss Wang has a lot of talent. If she can work hard and train, it will not be difficult to create more brilliant achievements.

It is worth mentioning the Nanjing athlete Lin Zhenji, who came in fourth place. She is the youngest and shortest, but her high jump posture is excellent. Her body is as light as a swallow. Every time she jumps over the bar, she rolls into the sandpit, and her buttocks never touch the bar, which shows that she has received basic training. Lin Zhenji is dressed like a boy, wearing shorts and a shirt, as well as a red and white watermelon-shaped hat. Once, when high jumping, her whole body passed over the bar, leaving only the little hat dangling on the bar, causing everyone to laugh. Unfortunately, when Lin Zhenji jumped over 1.24 meters, her calf suddenly cramped, but after applying turpentine and massaging it slightly, she continued to jump. Unfortunately, because the sandpit was too hard, she fell outside the sandpit and injured her buttocks, and was unable to get up for a long time. She was carried out of the stadium by the Boy Scout stretcher team for treatment. Her highest record stopped at 1.30 meters. Lin Zhenji is young and strong, and her movements are on the right track. As long as she can continue to train, her future is limitless.

### Women's Volleyball Semifinals Revealed: Shanghai, Taiwan, Hunan, and Guangdong Named as Final Four, Victory Determined Through Thrilling Battles

[Report from our newspaper] A total of nine teams participated in the women's volleyball competition. Yesterday's semifinal results produced the final four teams: Shanghai, Taiwan, Hunan, and Guangdong. The four teams will compete in a round-robin tournament starting on the 9th to determine the first, second, third, and fourth places. In yesterday's game, Jiangxi forfeited, and Shanghai won without a fight. In the other three games, Hunan defeated Zhejiang, Taiwan defeated Qingdao, and Guangdong defeated Henan.

Hunan's Fierce Women Achieve Great Victory

The Hunan and Zhejiang teams fought fiercely yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. The Hunan team won a great victory, with a score of two to zero. In terms of strength, the Hunan and Zhejiang teams are not very different. However, Hunan's front row has a strong player, Zheng Peikun, who is good at smashing and blocking. She is also good at taking advantage of weaknesses, while Zhejiang's front row lacks blockers, and the second row is busy defending, forming a defensive posture. The points lost in this way in each set reached more than ten points, which was Zhejiang's fatal blow. The scores of the two sets were: 21-12 and 21-10.

Interlude in a Friendship Match

After the Hunan-Zhejiang match, the Shanghai team invited the Zhejiang team for a friendly match for observation. All the Taiwan team members also came to watch. The result of the first set was 21-12, with Shanghai winning. Then the Zhejiang team requested to end the match. This friendly women's volleyball viewing match came to an end.

Taiwan's Hard-Won Victory

The Taiwan women's team, which defeated Andong the day before, defeated Qingdao again 2-1 yesterday afternoon. As soon as the match began, both sides showed their confidence in winning and launched heroic attacks. It was the most intense and thrilling volleyball duel of the day. Taiwan is good at offensive tactics, but Qingdao is not passively beaten. Each player gave their best, but they were defeated due to an unfavorable start. The scores were: 18-21, 21-9, and 21-5.

Guangdong and Henan Fight Desperately

In the match between Guangzhou and Henan, the former won 2-0. Guangzhou could have won easily, but they performed abnormally, making the game very thrilling. The scores of the two sets were 21-19 and 21-18.

### Men's Basketball Third Week: Air Force vs. Guizhou, Both Sides Play With Hard-Line Style, Guizhou is Brave But Lacks Strategy and Falls Short

[Report from our newspaper] The basketball games of the 7th National Games have entered the third week. United Logistics won against Hong Kong, Shanghai won against Guangdong, Shenyang won against Nanjing, Tianjin won against Jiangsu, and Air Force won against Guizhou. The first half of the Air Force vs. Guizhou match was the most exciting. Yesterday, there were also matches between the Philippines vs. Army, Malaya vs. Navy, and Fujian vs. Police, all of which were strong battles. Unfortunately, due to torrential rain, the matches had to be postponed to today.

United Logistics Wins Against Hong Kong

The match started at 9:00 AM. Hong Kong's Li Zhuomin scored first, but was immediately caught up by United Logistics' Cao Zhiji. Bu Yanshi added two more points, and Liao Dihang added the finishing touch, making it 6-2. After that, United Logistics took the lead and was unstoppable. Hong Kong also did not show weakness and remained calm. In this match, United Logistics adopted a five-man zone defense. Wang Shixuan was the soul of the team, and Jia Zhijun specialized in passing and shooting for the forwards. Their spirit of cooperation was rare among the teams. The team's tactics have been completely renewed, and they also have feints when necessary, but fewer than the Shanghai team. Hong Kong adopted a zone defense, which was also not weak, but because United Logistics' movements were fast and agile, and they were also full of energy, Hong Kong was no match for them. Hong Kong's Zhang Shurong was more accurate in shooting. He scored sixteen points in yesterday's match, but United Logistics' quick penetration led to a 58-36 defeat for Hong Kong.

Wang Shixuan 4 1

Jia Zhijun 0 9

Shanghai Wins Against Guangdong

The match was held at the sixth court at 9:00 AM. Shanghai started with Da Li, Wenhua, Chengzhang, Songyuan, and Yingke. Chengzhang made both free throws, and Zhao Bin scored a goal, tying the score at 2-2. Lianke and Zhenzhong then broke through, and Shanghai took the lead. Guangdong's shooting was inaccurate, and long-range passes were intercepted by Shanghai. Shanghai controlled the ball under both baskets. After 12-2, Guangdong took advantage of their opponent's lack of energy and scored several goals. At the end of the first half, Shanghai led 23-10. In the second half, all of Shanghai's players came on the field, launching a wheel war. The Guangdong team took the opportunity to catch up, forcing the score to 31-22. Shanghai then put their best lineup back on the field. Wenhua, Chengzhang, and Songyuan used skillful passing, and the score soared again, ending at 58-32.

Shenyang Wins Against Nanjing

The match was held at the original venue at 10:00 AM. Nanjing started strong but then weakened. In the first half, they led by six points, but due to a lack of stamina, Shenyang took advantage of their physical advantage in the second half, using volleyball-style passing to great effect. They quickly surpassed Nanjing, and the result was 59-42. In the first half, Nanjing led 25-19. Shenyang scored as many as 40 points in the second half, reversing the defeat.

Tianjin Wins Against Jiangsu

The match was held at 3:00 PM. Tianjin did not show their lively talent in the match against Zhejiang, but they played to the fullest against Jiangsu, resulting in a one-sided game, winning 72-26.

Air Force Wins Against Guizhou

The match was held at 3:00 PM. Both the Air Force and Guizhou teams wagered on physical strength. At first, Guizhou scored, and the defenders fouled, resulting in penalties for the Air Force. After that, the competition was fierce. Guizhou captain Guo Jiandong was injured in the corner of his eye and left the field. He was replaced by Song Jianzhong, who used his speed to assist the forwards. When a shot missed, Song chased after it and jumped up for a rebound, and the ball went into the net, drawing cheers from the crowd. At this time, the Air Force's strong attack began, but Guizhou was also brave, unyielding, and resisted stubbornly. However, because Guizhou's physical strength was not as good as the Air Force's, they frequently lost ground in the last ten minutes of the second half, resulting in a 68-49 defeat. This battle showed that Guizhou's individual techniques were excellent, but they did not pay attention to strategy and tactics, which was the main reason for their failure.

[Report from our newspaper] According to the Shanghai branch of the Mountain Country Red Cross Society, a total of 116 male and female athletes from various regions have fallen ill in the three days since the opening of the National Games, with 68 cases of internal medicine and 48 cases of surgery. The internal medicine cases are mainly gastrointestinal diseases caused by acclimatization, with the rest being colds and other symptoms. The surgical cases are all injuries sustained during exercise. The most serious situation is Tang Shibin, a boxer from Guangzhou. He was hit in the abdomen during the competition on the 6th and suddenly developed severe pain yesterday morning, vomiting and unable to eat. After diagnosis and treatment, he was sent to the Fourth Municipal Hospital for treatment. According to statistics, the most athletes who fell ill were from Northeast China, with 17 cases, followed by Hebei, with 16 cases.

### The Top Spins on the Rim of the Basket, Anxious Sweaty Handkerchiefs —A Fan's Praises—

Yesterday's basketball game was the third week, so it was unusually tense and exciting.

The audience arrived at the stadium at 7:00 AM and did not leave until 12:00 PM, showing no signs of fatigue. The game started at 3:00 PM, and the basketball stadium was full by 12:00 PM, demonstrating the large number of basketball fans in Shanghai.

It started raining at 4:00 PM, and the rain gradually increased, but the audience refused to leave. Some hid under the footboards of the stands, and even though they were soaked, they still wanted to see the athletes in action.

The audience's favorite players were Liao Dihang of United Logistics, Huang Longsheng of Guizhou, You Jianxing of the Air Force, and Chen Jinzhi and Chen Jinde of the Philippines.

Miss You loves basketball, and about four out of ten female audience members were there to see the game. Some men who may not love basketball were only accompanying their girlfriends.

The most nervous people in the stadium were the fans, especially the female fans. Every time a player shot, they were anxious for them. When a player shot the ball and it rolled on the rim of the basket, the female fans shouted "Oh no!" And when the ball went in, they shouted "Good!"

Some fans were betting on the outcome of the game, which added to the excitement.

Even though it was still early before the start of the game, airplanes soared in the sky, distributing promotional materials, but the fans were unmoved, because if they went to get the promotional materials, they would lose their seat.

Some players brought their girlfriends, and the girlfriends would clap when the players scored. When it was a tense moment, they would clench their teeth, hold their hands, and watch with bated breath. It is said that Miss ×'s handkerchief was completely soaked from the start to the end of the game.

Guizhou and the Navy, many of the Navy players were trained in Guiyang during the war, and most of the Air Force players were also trained in Guiyang, so even though the battle was very tense, the atmosphere was always harmonious.

When it rained, the matches between the Philippines vs. Army, Malaya vs. Navy, and Police vs. Fujian had just begun. The rain poured down, and the audience and players all went to take shelter from the rain, but after more than twenty minutes, they still had not left the stadium, waiting for the referee's decision on whether to continue the game. The news reporters standing in the rain were the most miserable. (Yusheng)

### Basketball Game Rescheduled Due to Torrential Rain

Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the basketball games of Malaya vs. Navy and Police vs. Fujian were played at the same time. Malaya faced the Navy, and the Police faced Fujian. The two sides were evenly matched, and it was expected that there would be exciting performances, so the audience was particularly crowded. Unfortunately, because the two games were held at the same time, people felt like they had to choose between "fish and bear's paw."

It was drizzling at the opening ceremony, and the games were played in the rain. Within five minutes, the rain poured down, and the referees had no choice but to announce the suspension of the games. At that time, the score of the Malaya vs. Navy game was 13-10, with the former leading. The score of the Police vs. Fujian game was 4-3, with the Police in the lead. The two exciting games will have to be rescheduled.

### Four Boxing Matches Held Yesterday

[Report from our newspaper] The 7th National Games Boxing Championship held four Class C matches at the Shaanxi Road City Sports Center starting at 7:00 PM last night. Li Dongfen and Xu Dawei, who had fought many times in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, respectively defeated Su Juncai and Gu Naixi, and advanced to the semi-finals. It is possible that they will meet in the finals. The big duel, which had been unable to be held for half a year due to disputes over the location, will be settled on the night of the 12th. In the other two matches, Li Kai of Shanghai and Yang Jinre of Guangdong won.

In the first match, Xu Dawei (Guangdong) faced Gu Naixi (Guizhou). Xu immediately hit Gu in the face in the second minute of the first round. Although Gu fought back, he could not resist, and Xu Dawei won with 24 and one-third points to 16 points.

In the second match, Li Kai (Shanghai) faced Huang Daxiong (Police). Li took the lead as soon as he entered the ring. At the start of the second round, he hit Huang's vital points continuously. By the 15th second, Huang was unable to resist and was taken away by the Boy Scout stretcher team.

In the third match, Li Dongfen (Hong Kong) faced Su Juncai (Police). After the bell rang, both sides adopted a defensive posture for one minute, and the audience booed loudly. They hesitated for more than ten seconds before officially starting to fight. As a result, Su Juncai was unable to resist and automatically gave up, so Li Dongfen won effortlessly.

In the last match, Yang Jinlai (Guangdong) faced Hong Qinmao (Taiwan). The two sides were evenly matched and fought to a stalemate. The winner was decided by points. As a result, Yang Jinlai won with 20 points to 18 and one-third points.

Three more matches will be held starting at 7:00 PM tonight at the same venue. Among them, the match between heavyweight Jiang Haoquan (United Logistics) and He Youzhang (Guangdong) is the most noteworthy.

Ye Guanxiong vs. Xu Naifang, Xu Runpei vs. Xia Gongquan, and Xu Weipei vs. Zhang De were all finished in less than half an hour. Taiwanese player Gao Dengke's skills were quite good, with backhands and volleys showing skill, and he was also able to run, but unfortunately he met Tao Guanqiu and was eventually eliminated. The Shanghai team's first singles was changed to Chen Yi (Li Guofan and Cai Guoji teamed up for doubles). In the first set, he lost to Wen Ling from Guizhou, but he managed to catch up in the next two sets. Wen Ling, due to physical exhaustion, gave up after losing five consecutive games in the third set (Chen Yi will play against Indonesia's Li Wenxuan tomorrow in the next round, Li's backhand is quite powerful). Toronto's Ma Yuanhua did not appear and forfeited, allowing Sun Chuanxin from Zhejiang to advance to the second round. Wang Qiumei from Malaya had a wrist injury and was replaced by Chen Qi'an, who won against Jiang Liangrui from Nanjing with a score of 3-1 with difficulty, due to age; Chen is unable to play well now.

### Central Bank Notifies Designated Banks of Changes to Import Exchange Settlement Methods: Settlement Based on Exchange Rate When Goods Actually Arrive at Port

[Reported by our newspaper] The Central Bank and the Import and Export Control Commission yesterday notified designated banks of some changes to import exchange settlement methods. A reporter specifically visited the responsible authorities, who stated that in the past, after obtaining an import license, foreign exchange could be purchased at the current exchange rate. However, the selling price of imported goods after arrival was not based on the exchange rate cost, but mostly exceeded the black market exchange rate. Recently, the black market price has skyrocketed, far exceeding the general price level, which is unreasonable. It is inevitable that the price of imported goods will follow the black market situation. To reduce this unreasonable phenomenon, when importers receive notification of an approved import license, they must first convert the foreign exchange amount into local currency at the current exchange rate and deposit 50% as a security deposit. Foreign exchange will then be settled when the goods arrive. However, to gain the trust of foreign merchants, the Central Bank may first lend foreign exchange to designated banks, with the amount not exceeding the security deposit paid. Designated banks may also borrow more foreign exchange, but must make up the amount of the security deposit. This measure is entirely to ensure that the market sales price of imported goods is not too far from the import cost, in order to achieve a fair distribution of profits. Recent reports of designated banks suggesting reforms to the foreign exchange system, submitted to Mr. Bei Zuyi, are merely rumors. The modification of the import exchange settlement method proves that it does not accord with the facts. The Central Bank's Business Bureau and the Import and Export Control Commission yesterday issued Notification No. 131 to designated banks, notifying each bank to implement the following regulations regarding the exchange settlement methods for import licenses, effective immediately:

(1) When an importer receives notification from the Import and Export Control Commission that their application has been approved for the issuance of an import license, they must immediately deposit 50% of the foreign exchange amount stated on the license with the Central Bank, converted into local currency at the current market price. This deposit can serve as a deposit for letters of credit or purchase orders opened by designated banks.

### Rice Price Yesterday Exceeded Previous Closing Price; People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee Sells Off Large Quantities; Over 18,000 Stones Sold in North and South Markets Combined

[Reported by our newspaper] The price of rice rose sharply again yesterday. In the South Market, the highest price for Japanese rice reached 5.1 million yuan. The authorities immediately began unlimited supply in both the North and South markets at 9:30 AM, setting the price of white rice at 4.6 million yuan in the South Market and 4.65 million yuan in the North Market, and early rice at 4.45 million yuan in both markets. Each merchant in the South Market could purchase 50 stones of white rice and early rice each, while merchants in the North Market could purchase 40 stones. Public sentiment stabilized, and many adopted a wait-and-see attitude. A total of 13,500 stones of rice were sold in the South Market and 4,880 stones in the North Market. The South Market closed with white rice at 4.6 million yuan, thin rice at 4.65 million yuan, and early rice at 4.5 million yuan, with 2,774 stones arriving. The North Market's closing price was similar to the previous day, with 2,826 stones arriving.

Flour prices opened above the price limit, with off-market trading occurring secretly. Old "Che Bing Chuan" brand once reached 1.76 million yuan, but later retreated to 1.72 million, still up 70,000-80,000 yuan. "Red Bee" and "Jiancheng" brands both closed at 1.68 million yuan. Bran was scarcely traded, with prices quoted as high as 1.2 million yuan. In the afternoon, small bags of bran were priced at 780,000 yuan, and flour mills added 100,000 yuan to the price.

Miscellaneous grains generally rose, with soybeans being purchased by Shantou merchants. "Zha" beans and others surged by more than 200,000 yuan. Corn was further absorbed by Qingdao merchants, rising by 100,000 yuan, and red sorghum increased by more than 100,000 yuan. Green beans were also intermittently traded by Hakka merchants, rising by 200,000-300,000 yuan. Selected green beans were rarely traded, and the market also rose. Raw peanuts were not sold at all, so no price was opened, but the quoted price rose by a huge 1 million yuan. Raw peanuts from Qinhuangdao reached the 10 million mark, rising by 1 million yuan.

Edible oil trading came to a standstill because the authorities notified that transactions could not exceed the previous day's closing price, causing sellers to be unwilling to sell. Later, the opening price for old-barrel raw oil was quoted at 13.5 million yuan, and soybean oil at 11.5 million yuan, an increase of about 1 million yuan. Small-cart sesame oil was quoted as high as 1.53 million yuan, an increase of 1.8 million yuan. Soybean cake also did not open, with a quoted price of 1.2 million yuan, but it was impossible to buy.

### Market Conditions in Various Places

Tianjin [Reported by our newspaper, Tianjin, 7th] The rising tide swept the Tianjin market, with rumors of all kinds. On the 7th, flour already showed a high price of 3.1 million yuan, rice 5.7 million yuan, 20-count "Three Ding" yarn 172 million yuan, and "Five Blessings" cloth 6.34 million yuan, with prices of all goods rising firmly.

Beiping [Reported by our newspaper, Beiping, 6th] The rising tide hit the ancient capital fiercely, and the gold standard also rose several levels. The black market price of gold was rumored to have reached 5,600, American dollars 115, top-quality flour 250,000,000,000 per catty, and "Haichang" blue cloth 7.3 million yuan.

Wuhu [Reported by our newspaper, Wuhu, 7th] Rice prices soared. Today, machine-milled rice is 4.8 million yuan, and brown rice is also 4.2 million yuan. Prices of all goods are also rising.

Taiyuan [Reported by our newspaper, Taiyuan, 7th] Shanxi finance was affected by fluctuations in other areas, and prices have risen dramatically in the past three days. Grain prices, which had been stable for many days, have risen sharply again. Millet has risen by about 5 million yuan per stone, breaking the 20 million mark. Bagged flour is over 7 million yuan, and sorghum has risen again to 100,000 yuan per catty. Silver dollars reached a new high.

Hefei Prices here have been led by gold in recent days, rising in a straight line. Today, gold is selling for 66 million "old taels," and top-quality rice is 4 million yuan, up 30%. Pork is 100,000 yuan, up 40%, and there are no sales. "Five Oceans" cloth is also rising.

Jinan [Reported by our newspaper, Jinan, 7th] Price fluctuations here are unprecedentedly fierce. Gold rose to 65 million yuan per tael at noon on the 7th, 20-count "Spider" yarn 172 million yuan per piece, and kerosene rose to 25 million yuan per large barrel.

Wuxi [Reported by our newspaper, Wuxi, 7th] This morning, prices continued to soar. After the authorities arrested a large number of speculators, the soaring trend eased in the afternoon. White rice was 5.226 million yuan, "Bai Yuan" rice 5.386 million yuan, "Yang Xian" rice 5.076 million yuan, "Bu Xian" rice 5.106 million yuan, wheat 4.8 million yuan, white wheat 510,000 yuan, flour 1.735 million yuan, soybean oil 11.05 million yuan, and cotton yarn 178 million yuan.

### Yarn and Cloth Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was lively due to various favorable rumors. Merchants from Tianjin, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and other regions continued to purchase actively, and merchants outside the industry strongly boosted prices. The market was filled with buying sentiment, and the market soared. 42-count "Blue Phoenix" fine yarn opened at a jump of 21 million yuan. When news spread of rising cloth prices, a wave of buying occurred, and the market rose again to a new high of 314 million yuan. Around 10:30 AM, the authorities suddenly posted a notice, accepting applications from the industry, and public sentiment turned uncertain. Merchants sold off their holdings, and the market price fell back to a closing price of 304 million yuan, still a substantial increase of 20 million yuan compared to the previous day. 21-count "Double Horse" yarn also reached a peak of 220 million yuan, but there were not many buyers, and it ultimately rose by 13 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other counts of fine yarn also continued to rise by 8-9 million to 14.5 million yuan.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened with prices appearing stable but secretly firm. The market was flooded with speculative capital, and merchants purchased actively. Dyeing factories, having sold off a significant amount of colored cloth in the previous two days, also showed strong demand for gray cloth. Cloth merchants and retailers seized the opportunity to boost prices, and speculative sentiment soared, leading to new high prices. 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth rose sharply by 280,000 yuan at the opening, breaking the 6 million yuan mark. With demand exceeding supply, the market rose all the way to 6.45 million yuan. Near the close, there were profit-taking sales, and prices fell back to close at 6.32 million yuan, a jump of 540,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Other fine cloths, rents, twills, and serges also generally rose sharply. Shilin cloth dyeing factories temporarily suspended sales, and very little trading occurred. The final transaction price for "Dragon Head" fine cloth was 6.3 million yuan. Purchase orders for "Laba" children's fine cloth supplied by the previous day's textile mills increased to 400,000 yuan, and the market sentiment was increasingly strong.

### Hong Kong Gold and Exchange Rates

[United Press International, Hong Kong, 7th] Following a weekend of decline, Hong Kong's financial and gold markets opened weak on the 7th, except for the British pound. The main reason was a lack of buying interest in various parts of China. The fall in gold prices was due to the fact that 50,000 ounces of gold came from Macau this week, while sales in China were only 20,000 ounces. The opening and closing prices on the 7th are listed below (unit: Hong Kong dollars):

Opening Closing

Gold per tael 332.00 332.50

US dollar per dollar 5.45 5.46

National currency per million 6.00 6.50

British pound per pound 13.70 13.85

### Song Hanzhang and Xi Demao to Take Office Today

The newly appointed Chairman of the Bank of China, Mr. Song Hanzhang, and the General Manager, Mr. Xi Demao, are scheduled to take office today (8th). Mr. Song and Mr. Xi will also address all bank employees at 8:30 AM today and will hold a public reception for various sectors at a later date.

### "Yong Yarn" Reaches 3,000 Yuan Mark; Sudden Reversal and Plunge Near the Close

Driven by financial stocks, materials, and Hong Kong Electric, "Yong" yarn saw a new high price of 3,020 yuan. However, those in the industry, under the surveillance of the multilateral forces, once Guangdong merchants made a secret sale, immediately reversed the trend and plunged near the close. The morning began uncertainly, with yarn and cloth still popular. "Yong" yarn opened at 2,900 yuan and "Xinghe" opened high at 1,120 yuan. After the opening, people were anxious about the foreign exchange rate's prolonged absence, and prices fluctuated, returning to 2,870 yuan. With no change in the exchange rate, prices fell to a low of 2,855 yuan. External stimulation was strong, rising to 2,960 yuan. Brokerage fees opened high at 31 yuan and 35 yuan, then retreated to 2,870 yuan. Guangdong merchants purchased actively, rising to a new high of 2,975 yuan. Near noon, it fell to a low of 2,865 yuan, closing the morning at 2,890 yuan. Except for "Hengfeng" rising to the limit, "China Cement" rising by half a percent, "Yong" yarn, "Huaxin," "Xinyi," "Jinglun," and "Commercial Press" rising slightly, "China-France," "America-Asia," "Xinghe," "Huafeng," "Tongyi," "China Silk," "Xinhua," and "Zhabei" falling by half a percent, the rest experienced slight declines.

The afternoon opened at 2,960 yuan and once retreated to 2,920 yuan. The national banks made only a few purchases, buyers rose, and Hong Kong Electric also contracted, rising to a new high of 3,020 yuan. After 3:15 PM, the wind began to change, with reports of authorities intensifying countermeasures. The reaction began and could not be sold off, and mixed stocks became difficult to trade. Prices suddenly fell to a low of 2,820 yuan, closing at only 2,830 yuan. Compared to the last close, "Datong" and "China Cement" were flat, "Zhabei," "Lianan," and "China Silk" rose slightly, "China-France," "Xinyi," "Xinghe," "Xinhua," "Jinglun," and "Hengfeng" fell by half a percent, and the rest declined slightly. Among the unlisted stocks traded off-market, bank stocks rose the most, increasing by one percent, and the rest ranged from slightly higher to half a percent.

Government Bonds Yesterday saw a minor rally. "Tong Bing" opened at 187,000, falling from a high of 200,000 to 183,000 before stabilizing slightly. Compared to the previous day, all bonds rose by 1,000 to 4,000 yuan. 6 million yuan were traded.

Foreign Stocks Yesterday continued to be stimulated by Hong Kong Electric. "Yi" yarn rose from a new high of 5.1 million yuan, briefly retreating to 4.97 million, and remaining stable near the close. Banks and money houses offered supply, while securities and foreign houses entered. As a result, compared to the previous close, rubber stocks and plantations rose by one percent, and the rise and fall of other stocks were slight.

Literature and History

### On the Twelve Times of the Day

— Wang Chongmin

I have seen nineteen manuscripts of the Twelve Times of the Day from Dunhuang, which, after removing duplicates and collating, amount to ten types.

(1) *Sacred Teachings for the Twelve Times of the Day*, 2 scrolls, Pelliot 2918, 2734

(2) *Dharma Body for the Twelve Times of the Day*, 3 scrolls, Pelliot 4028, 2813, 3113

(3) *Learning the Way for the Twelve Times of the Day*, 1 scroll, Pelliot 2943

(4) *Filial Piety for the Twelve Times of the Day*, 3 scrolls, Pelliot 3604, 3116, scroll collected by Luo Zhenyu

(5) *Written by Secretary Bai, Filial Piety for the Twelve Times of the Day*, 1 scroll, Pelliot 3821

(6) *Filial Piety for the Twelve Times of the Day Throughout the World*, 1 scroll, collected by Luo Zhenyu

(7) *Filial Piety for the Twelve Times of the Day*, 2 scrolls, Pelliot 3821, Stein 4129

(8) *Filial Piety for the Twelve Times of the Day*, 1 scroll, Pelliot 3821

(9) *"Vimalakirti" for the Twelve Times of the Day*, 1 scroll, Pelliot 3141

(10) *General Exhortation for the Four Assemblies to Practice According to the Teachings for the Twelve Times of the Day*, 4 scrolls, Pelliot 2714, 2054, 3286, 3087

Let us first discuss the division of the day into twelve times, and the origins of matching the twelve times with the twelve branches and the twelve names such as "Midnight" and "Cockcrow."

Dividing the day and night into twelve times should not be later than the era of dividing the night into five watches. Using the names of the twelve branches to represent the twelve times is also a natural thing. I assume that this practice originated in the Western Han Dynasty, and this is likely not wrong. As for matching the twelve names such as "Midnight" and "Cockcrow" with the twelve branch names to record the twelve times, it seems that a system had not yet been established in the Western Han Dynasty, but they were used independently to represent segments of time. As shown by the examples given in Gu Yanwu's *Records of Daily Knowledge*, Volume 20, in the article "Anciently, There Was No Division of a Day into Twelve Times," things were very chaotic in the pre-Qin and Western Han periods. For example, as Gu mentioned, the *Book of Changes* and the *Spring and Autumn Annals* have "Midday," and the *Book of Poetry* has "The Sun is Just at Midday"; the *Spring and Autumn Annals* has "Cockcrow," the *Book of Poetry* has "Morning Meeting," and the *Book of Rites* has "Dawning," "Early Morning," "Morning Time," "Late Morning," and "Cockcrowing at Dawn." The *Huainanzi* chapter "Astronomical Training" describes the sun's journey from sunrise to sunset, passing through fifteen places and reflecting fifteen times of the day—clearly not including "Midnight" and the times adjacent to midnight. Therefore, the fifteen times of the *Huainanzi* cannot represent a whole day. However, he arranged the chaotic names into an order based on the sun's movement, which was truly the first major reorganization.

Neither the *Huainanzi* nor other works of the same era seem to have combined the twelve branch names with the twelve time names such as "Midnight" and "Cockcrow," because at that time, the twelve time names had not been determined or arranged. However, their arrangement and determination probably occurred in the late Western Han Dynasty. Wang Chong's *Discourses Weighed in the Balance*, Volume 23, "Times," already says:

"The day is divided into twelve times, dawn is Yin, sunrise is Mao." Before Wang Chong (27-?), the twelve branch names and the twelve time names were clearly used in combination and had already been arranged and determined! Du Yu (132-284) lived two hundred years after Wang Chong and used the twelve times of the day, which had long been commonly used in society, to annotate the "Ten Times" in the text of the fifth year of Duke Zhao in the *Zuo Zhuan*, naturally holding tightly to what did not fit!

Only after such a form was determined and popularized could the possibility of the Twelve Times Song arise!

Furthermore, two hundred years after Du Yu, Wang Rong (468-496) composed twelve *Dharma Music Lyrics*, telling the story of Prince Siddhartha's life, just like the style and story of the *Sacred Teachings for the Twelve Times of the Day* from Dunhuang. Therefore, I say that Wang Rong's *Dharma Music Lyrics* already had the style of the Twelve Times, but without the title of Twelve Times. The twelve *Dharma Music Lyrics* are recorded in *Collected Works for the Propagation and Illumination of Buddhism*, Volume 30.

Shortly after Wang Rong, there was Abbot Baozhi's *Twelve Times Praise*. The earliest source of the *Twelve Times Praise* is the *Jingde Record of the Transmission of the Lamp*, Volume 29. Zang Maoxun's *Poems Collected*, Volume 56, and Yangshan Cheng's Volume 2 also reprint it, titled "*Twelve Times Song*." It is possible that the Twelve Times Song was already being sung in the time of Zhi Gong, but this Twelve Times Song has never been cited in books before the Zhu Dynasty; secondly, there would not have been a 3-3-7 style of song lyrics in the time of Zhi Gong, nor would there have been such good vernacular language; thirdly, Zhi Gong was slightly older than Bodhidharma and should not have praised Zen Buddhism after Bodhidharma. Therefore, I suspect that the Twelve Times attributed to Baozhi in the *Record of the Transmission of the Lamp* is somewhat unreliable. However, I am an amateur in Buddhism, so I consulted Mr. Zhou Yiliang. Mr. Zhou replied with a long letter, saying that Zhi Gong's Twelve Times in the *Record of the Transmission of the Lamp* is a forgery and explaining why Zhi Gong was forged. I also consulted Mr. Hu Shih, who also thought it was not genuine and cited some evidence of later origin.

The *Book of Sui*, Volume 15, "Treatise on Music," says:

"Emperor Yang did not understand music and did not care about it. Later, he made a large number of flamboyant pieces with extremely licentious lyrics. He ordered the music director Bai Mingda to create new sounds: the *Ten Thousand Years of Joy*, the *Hidden Hook Joy*, the *Meeting on the Seventh Evening Joy* (omitted) and the *Twelve Times*, etc. Suppressed and concealed, the mournful sounds were cut off, and the Emperor was endlessly pleased."

Bai Mingda was from Kucha. The *Book of Sui* lists these new sounds in the Kucha music section. Looking at these song titles, we can imagine that these songs were all based on existing song lyrics, and Bai Mingda was ordered to compose a new tune. The Japanese scholar Hayashi Ichizo wrote an article titled "Research on the Tunes of Sui and Tang Yanyue Music," and his conclusion was that "the various tunes of popular music can be said to be Hu music tunes wearing Chinese clothes" (Guo Moruo's translation, page 120). I think that's right. Therefore, those flamboyant pieces were not only the Hu-ization of the tunes, but the lyrics were still those that existed in the time of Emperor Yang of Sui.

The tenth type of the Twelve Times of the Day that I have collated from Dunhuang is titled "General Exhortation for the Four Assemblies to Practice According to the Teachings," which is the longest piece. The entire piece is written in 3-3-7 sentences, with each time repeating nine times at the least and sixteen times at the most, totaling one hundred and thirty-five verses and about two thousand three hundred words, so I call it the "Great Twelve Times." Pelliot scroll 2714 says, "In the Zhonghe year, leap March, hungry people kill each other," which easily reminds us of Qin Fu Yin's "In the Zhonghe Guimao, spring in March," and should be works of the same era. Examining the records, Guimao is the third year of Zhonghe, without a leap March; only in the fifth year of Zhonghe (885) was there a leap March. This "Great Twelve Times" should have been written in the fifth year of Zhonghe or slightly later. Furthermore, Pelliot scroll 2054 is a manuscript written in the second year of Tongguang (924), but it does not have the verse "In the Zhonghe year." This is probably because it was no longer relevant to current events, so the performers deleted that verse. The fact that this "Great Twelve Times" was preserved in four manuscripts in the Dunhuang caves is due to the fact that in the temples of the late Tang and Five Dynasties period, it was often used as a lecture and chanting text. This can be seen from the last verse:

"Respectfully ask, the day will set,

Calculate all disciples should return.

Chanting Buddha, go home,

Tomorrow on time, do not be late."

Three of the four manuscripts of this "Great Twelve Times" do not list the author's surname. However, on the back of Pelliot scroll 2054, it is recorded as "Grand Master Zhiyan's Twelve Times, one scroll." Who should this Grand Master Zhiyan be?

If it is determined that this "Great Twelve Times" is a work from the fifth year of Zhonghe (885) or slightly later, this Grand Master Zhiyan should not be Grand Master Zhiyan of Niu Tou Mountain in Jinling (600-677), and even less likely to be the tenth disciple of Buddha Dashi, Grand Master Zhiyan, nor does it seem like Zhiyan of the Xiang Temple on Mount Zhongnan, who translated scriptures. We can only say that this Grand Master Zhiyan was a not-very-famous monk of the Zhonghe era of the Tang Dynasty. This statement is logically correct, but it may not be correct in fact. Because we have already identified the Zhi Gong Twelve Times in the Jingde Record of the Transmission of the Lamp as a forgery, and the White Secretary's Filial Piety for the Twelve Times of the Day that came out of Dunhuang, the White Secretary refers to Bai Juyi, and it is obvious that it is a forgery without needing to be identified. Both of those pieces were written by unknown authors and were attributed to the names of Zhi Gong and Bai Juyi after a long period of circulation. If we understand this point, it is correct to say that this "Great Twelve Times" is attributed to Zhiyan before Zhi Gong, and it is also correct to say that it is attributed to Grand Master Zhiyan of Niu Tou Mountain.

The fourth to eighth types of the Twelve Times are all called "Filial Piety Text." The eighth type, Pelliot scroll 3821, tells twelve historical stories, and I have a separate article discussing and researching them.

Chen Zhensun's *Annotations and Explications of Books from the Straight Studio*, Volume 12, "Immortals," has a *Master Xu's Twelve Times Song*, one scroll, explaining: "His name is unknown." Furthermore, Song Shi Xiaoying's *Luo Lake Field Records*, Volume 3, records Master Zhantang Zhun of Bao Feng's *Twelve Times Praise*. Their era should be slightly later than the ones that came out of Dunhuang. (Written on November 18, 1947, revised on March 26, 1948.)

### Matters Concerning Lu Shanqing's Deeds: Mr. Xiang Zonglu's Posthumous Works

The Japanese-circulated "Selections of Refined Literature with Collected Annotations," in one hundred and twenty volumes, had its fragmented scrolls printed by Luo Shuyan. Now, there is also a newly printed Japanese edition. It quotes extensively from Lu Shanqing's explanations. Yang Xingwu's copied ancient scroll in thirty volumes also records Lu Shanqing's explanations at the top margins of the first volume. However, both the "Old Book of Tang" and "New Book of Tang" do not include a biography of Shanqing, and his official career is unknown. Sen Ritsushi's "Record of Visiting Ancient Classics" states, "Regarding Lu Shanqing's annotation of the 'Selections of Refined Literature,' I have searched through historical records, but I cannot find it listed." This shows that he had long been interested in this matter.

Now, examining the Tang Kai Cheng Stone Classics, the memorial presented by Li Linfu, Scholar of the Jixian Academy and Chancellor, concerning the annotation of the "Monthly Ordinances" (Yue Ling), mentions that Lu Shanqing, Attendant Academician and Military Advisor of the Henan Prefecture Granary, co-authored the annotation. The "New Book of Tang, Record of Literature" contains one volume of the imperially revised "Record of Rites, Monthly Ordinances," and lists the annotations by scholars of the Jixian Academy, including Li Linfu, among whom are three Attendant Academicians, with Shanqing being one of them. The varying degrees of detail in their titles are because Shanqing's original official position was Military Advisor of the Henan Prefecture Granary, and he entered the Jixian Academy as an Attendant Academician due to his involvement in compiling books. Volume thirty of the "Tang Liudian" states, "The Military Advisor of the Henan Prefecture Granary is of the lower seventh rank." Volume nine states, "In the Jixian Academy Painting Institute, officials of the fifth rank and above are Academicians, and those of the sixth rank and below are Attendant Academicians." Shanqing's official rank was below the sixth rank, so he was an Attendant Academician. The historical records omit his original official position. The ancient Japanese manuscript of the "Meng Qiu" records that after Li Liang's memorial recommending the "Meng Qiu," there is an inscription that reads, "In the fifth year of Tianbao (the year is suspected to be 'zai'; the era name had already been changed to 'zai'), August 1st, Li Liang, Prefect of Raozhou, presented the memorial, ordering Lu Shanqing, Director of Studies of the Imperial Academy, to write the memorial." (See "Record of Visiting Books in Japan." Li Qi respectfully notes: The Paris-preserved Dunhuang fragmented scroll of Li's "Meng Qiu," P.2710, Li Liang's presented memorial, has the inscription "Liang ordered Lu Shanqing, Director of Studies of the Imperial Academy, to create the memorial. The memorial was not acted upon because Liang was replaced, and the matter was shelved.") Volume twenty-one of the "Tang Liudian" states, "The Director of Studies of the Imperial Academy is of the lower fourth rank." Shanqing was formerly Military Advisor of the Henan Prefecture Granary, entered the Jixian Academy as an Attendant Academician, and by the fifth year of Tianbao, had been promoted to Director of Studies. Therefore, his tenure as Military Advisor of the Henan Prefecture Granary and as Attendant Academician of the Jixian Academy was before the fifth year of Tianbao.

The "New Book of Tang, Record of Literature, Philosophical Works" contains Lu Shanqing's seven-volume annotation of "Mencius," also found in the "Chongwen General Catalogue," which states, "Lu Shanqing deleted Zhao's annotation." Sun Yigong's "Sounds and Meanings of Mencius" frequently quotes his explanations, and the preface states, "Those who annotated it include Zhao Qi and Lu Shanqing." It also states, "Since Lu Shanqing, although their interpretations may have minor differences, they all adhere to Zhao's school." In the false "Mencius" with Sun's commentary, under the title, it also states, "As for the 'Chongwen General Catalogue' of the Imperial Dynasty, 'Mencius' only preserves Zhao Qi's fourteen-volume annotation and Lu Shanqing's seven-volume annotation." In recent times, Ma Zhuwu compiled scattered fragments of Shanqing's annotation of "Mencius," and then said, "Shanqing's identity is unknown," which is careless.

Shanqing also authored the "New Character Forest" (Xin Zi Lin), which is frequently cited in the "Guangyun" (Expanded Rhyme Dictionary). In modern times, Huang Youyuan of the Hanxue Hall compiled an edition. Ren Youzhi's "Textual Research on the Character Forest" is also appended to the end of each section. The end of the book contains a note by Ding Xiaoshan stating, "In the 'Guangyun,' under the tenth Yu rhyme, it is cited as Lu Gai. The annotation under the 'Chu' character in Huang's compiled edition of the 'Character Forest' states: 'It is suspected that Gai is the given name, and Shanqing is the courtesy name.'" It is the case that people of the Tang Dynasty often used their courtesy name. Shanqing's given name was Gai, but the memorial still refers to him as Shanqing, perhaps as a comparison?

His annotations of other books are listed in the "Catalogue of Books Seen" by the Japanese Fujiwara Sukeyo: "Book of Changes" in eight volumes, "Ancient Script of Documents" in ten volumes, "Book of Zhou" in sixteen volumes (in the poetry section, suspected to be a mistake for "Mao's Book of Poetry"), "Three Rites" in thirty volumes, "Three Commentaries" in thirty volumes, "Sayings on Poetry" in six volumes, and "Liezi" in eight volumes. (Also listed is "Mencius" in seven volumes.) His writings also include "Continuation of the Liang Dynasty's Record of Common Surnames and Given Names" (recorded in the "Siku General Catalogue, Class of Encyclopedic Works," with a "Hanhai" edition containing this book), which can be considered abundant.

Shanqing's annotation of the "Selections of Refined Literature" is mentioned in the "Jade Sea" (Yu Hai), volume fifty-four, quoting the "Notes of the Jixian Academy," which states, "In the third month of the nineteenth year of Kaiyuan, Xiao Song memorialized that Wang Zhiming, Li Yuancheng, and Chen Ju should annotate the 'Selections of Refined Literature.' Previously, Feng Guangzhen received an imperial order to enter the academy to proofread the 'Selections of Refined Literature.' He memorialized that Li Shan's old annotations were not precise and requested a revision, which was approved. Guangzhen himself wrote several volumes of annotations. Song, considering the old work of previous generations, wished to continue their efforts and instructed Zhiming and others to compile them. In the fifth month of the following year, he ordered Zhiming, Yuancheng, and Lu Shanqing to focus on annotating the 'Selections of Refined Literature,' but the matter was not completed." Xiao Song was dismissed from the chancellorship in the twenty-first year of Kaiyuan. Li Linfu first became chancellor in the twenty-second year of Kaiyuan. Volume twenty-one of the "Comprehensive Institutions" (Tongdian) states, "The Jixian Academy Writing Institute always had a chancellor as a scholar to oversee the academy's affairs." The "Tang Zhi" agrees. Xiao Song oversaw the matter of proofreading the "Selections of Refined Literature" because he was the chancellor in charge of the academy at the time. Li Linfu oversaw the matter of annotating the "Monthly Ordinances" because he was the chancellor in charge of the academy at the time. From this, it can be inferred that Shanqing received the order to annotate the "Selections of Refined Literature" before Xiao Song's dismissal from the chancellorship in the twenty-first year of Kaiyuan. His participation in annotating the "Monthly Ordinances" must have been after Linfu became chancellor in the twenty-second year of Kaiyuan. In the fifth year of Tianbao, he was the Director of Studies of the Imperial Academy, so his tenure as Military Advisor of the Henan Prefecture Granary and as Attendant Academician of the Jixian Academy was before the fifth year of Tianbao. The "Notes of the Jixian Academy" state that "the matter was not completed," but the collected annotations extensively quote his explanations, which means that Lu did have a completed book. Could it be that Shanqing initially received the order to co-annotate with Wang and Li, but the matter was suspended, and Shanqing became determined to complete it on his own?

### Ceremonial Music and Military Marches

— Wang Shiqing

Ceremonial music and military marches are one and the same, but historical records are quite confusing. To make things easier to understand, I would like to roughly analyze them.

(1) The annotation to the "Rites and Ceremonies" section of the "Book of Later Han" quotes Cai Yong's "Treatise on Music": "There are four types of Han music: first, the Great Yu Music, which is used for sacrifices at the suburban altars, banquets in the imperial halls, and feasts. ... Second, the Zhou Hymns and Elegant Music, which are used for ceremonies at the Imperial Academy, archery competitions, and sacrifices to the Six Venerables and the Gods of Soil and Grain. ... Third, the Yellow Gate Ceremonial Music, which the emperor uses to entertain his ministers. The poetry says, 'The drums resound, and we dance.' The short flute and military marches are military music. It is said that it was created by the Yellow Emperor and Qi Bo to establish majesty, promote virtue, and encourage the soldiers." The Han music system is fully illustrated here, but only the twenty-two tunes of short flute and military marches, such as "Zhu Lu" (The Egret), have been passed down to later generations. The "Treatise on Music" in the "Book of Jin" states: "During the Han Dynasty, there was the music of short flute and military marches, and its tunes included 'Zhu Lu,' 'Thinking of the Sorrowful Old Man,' 'Ai Ru Zhang,' 'Return to the Emperor,' 'Yong Li,' 'Battle South of the City,' 'Mount Wu is High,' 'General's Advance,' 'The Emperor's Horse is Yellow,' 'Ascending the Mausoleum,' 'Something to Think About,' 'Pheasant Class,' 'The Sage Emerges,' 'Fragrant Tree,' 'Wickedness Above,' 'Approaching the High Terrace,' 'As Far as Expected,' 'Stone Remains,' 'Wu Cheng,' 'Black Cloud,' 'Yellow Sparrow's Flight,' 'Fishing Rod,' etc., which are listed under Ceremonial Music, mostly describing battle scenes." The Wei, Wu, and Jin dynasties also successively made adjustments, and the titles of the tunes were changed, but the general term "Short Flute and Military Marches" was still used. According to Cai's text, Ceremonial Music is for banquets, while Military Marches are for the military; and the "Book of Jin" also states that it "mostly describes battle scenes," which is more consistent with Cai's text. Therefore, Ceremonial Music and Military Marches have clear distinctions in application and were undoubtedly two different types of Han music from the beginning. As a result, later references to Cai's text often place numbers above "Short Flute and Military Marches" to distinguish it from the first three types. (See the "Book of Song" and the "Comprehensive Examination of Documents," etc.)

(2) However, the tone of Cai's text still seems ambiguous. If the word "four types" were not clearly stated in the front, it would be quite natural and reasonable to regard Military Marches as a type of Ceremonial Music. Moreover, the earliest appearance of Short Flute and Military Marches is in the "Book of Jin." During the great chaos in Tokyo, various types of music were scattered and lost. These were probably collected after the Han Dynasty. Therefore, the number of tunes collected varies greatly in later generations. The "Book of Jin" records twenty-two tunes, the "Book of Song" records eighteen tunes, while Liu Zongyuan of the Tang Dynasty and others in the Song and Yuan dynasties have verified twelve tunes. Not only that, but not all of the tunes are military music. For example, "Return to the Emperor" describes imperial tours, "Ascending the Mausoleum" describes sacrifices, and "Zhu Lu" describes auspicious omens. It can be seen that the content of Military Marches is actually very broad. As for "Wu Cheng," "Yellow Sparrow," "Black Cloud," and "As Far As Expected," according to the "Jianchu Records," they are mostly cavalry music and now also belong to Military Marches. Therefore, the productions of the Wei and Jin dynasties deviated from the original meaning and tended to focus on describing meritorious deeds. This is a major shift in Military Marches. By the Northern and Southern Dynasties, the name "Short Flute and Military Marches" was directly changed to "Ceremonial Music Tunes." The "Book of Song" states: "Han Ceremonial Music tunes are called Military Marches." The "Comprehensive Institutions" states: "Ceremonial music is short flute and military marches." The "Comprehensive Records" clearly notes: "In the Han and Jin dynasties, it was called Short Flute and Military Marches; in the Northern and Southern Dynasties, it was called Ceremonial Music Tunes." Do these not clearly tell us that Ceremonial Music and Military Marches are precisely united as one?

However, there should still be a distinction, and that lies in their subordinate relationship. Regarding the Way, there are two different views:

(3) Cui Bao's "Annotations on Current Affairs" states: "Han music has Yellow Gate Ceremonial Music, which the emperor uses to entertain his ministers. Short Flute Military Marches is one part of Ceremonial Music and is also bestowed upon meritorious lords. Therefore, Yellow Gate Ceremonial Music, Short Flute Military Marches, and Cavalry Music are collectively called Ceremonial Music, but their uses are different." The "Comprehensive Institutions" states: "Han Ceremonial Music tunes include Military Marches." Yang Shen's "Critiques of Lyrics" states: "Ceremonial Music is the general name for all music. Its application is also different. That which is used for court assemblies and banquets is called Yellow Gate Ceremonial Music; that which is used for processions is called Cavalry Music; that which is played on horseback during military campaigns is called Cavalry Music; and that which is played at ancestral temples during the return of the army is called Short Flute Military Marches." They probably considered Cai's tone and adopted a broad view of Ceremonial Music. In reality, precisely because they restored Military Marches to its original meaning on the one hand and expanded Ceremonial Music to the general term for all music on the other hand, they had to subordinate Military Marches to Ceremonial Music. According to this view, Military Marches would be called Ceremonial Music Military Marches Tunes. (The "Collection of Music Bureau Poetry" marks some Ceremonial Music tunes with this name.)

(4) If one looks at the actual content of Military Marches, one can say that Military Marches is actually the sum of all music. Jia Duanlin once said: "The Short Flute Military Marches since the Wei and Jin dynasties are the ancient Elegance and Hymns." Indeed, the music of imperial banquets was called Elegance in ancient times, and the music of sacrifices was called Hymns in ancient times; doesn't Military Marches include Ceremonial Music? This view was formally put forward by Jiang Kui of the Southern Song Dynasty. According to the "Preface to the Ceremonial Music and Ceremonial Music Tunes" in Baishi Daoren's "Songs": "Ceremonial music is Han music. That which is played in front of the palace is called Ceremonial Music, and that which is played in the military is called Cavalry Music." Here, Ceremonial Music and Cavalry Music are listed together and each is a part of Ceremonial Music, which is exactly the opposite of Cui Bao's opinion. He adopted Liu Zongyuan's naming and called it Ceremonial Music Ceremonial Music Tunes, which, when viewed in comparison, is quite interesting.

In short, Ceremonial Music and Military Marches were originally two different musical chapters when the Han Dynasty created music, but as a result of later evolution, they have become one and two, and two and one.

### The Plan for the Day Lies in the Night

— Bai Yong

Recently, I gave my students the topic of "Night Reading," and one student actually wrote: "The saying 'The plan for the day lies in the morning' doesn't seem very reasonable to me, because I'm not used to reading in the morning, and it's too hot at noon. Of course, night is the most suitable time. The sounds in the morning are really too noisy: 'Huang Ma, bring me a bottle of boiled water!' 'Help me dry a few bowls of porridge!' 'Help me comb my hair, comb two small braids!' 'Help me...' Do you think I can still read? In the afternoon, I have to do trigonometric functions in English... It's simply impossible to read." This student will definitely be a comrade of Mr. Lin Yutang. I have already written "I look forward to it, I will wait and see."

In fact, upon further thought, what plans do we make in the morning? Although the word "plan" can also be interpreted as "having a smooth beginning will surely lead to a complete future," the morning in the city is completely a world of carrying dung buckets and selling green vegetables. Even the big shots and tycoons who go to office buildings and writing rooms won't lazily get up until after nine o'clock, except for those workers who claim to be of the proletariat. Conversely, if you go to dance halls, bars, hotels, theaters, and cinemas after 7 p.m. every night, wouldn't that really represent the facade of urban life? This doesn't even include the core. The core is in the "branch factories" of the tycoons, the "secret lairs" of the bosses, or the "small residences" of the celebrities. In these places, after the night is deep and quiet, the abacus and the brain move together, and human flesh and gold banknotes are eaten together. This is the center of power that dominates the city, the main force that threatens everyone's spiritual and material feelings.

Therefore, the ancients advocated having a clear conscience in the darkness and not deceiving oneself in a dark room.

However, all maxims and slogans represent a kind of shortcoming and failure. Everyone will boast on the surface, but no one doesn't play tricks behind the scenes. I think Guanxi Master Yang Zhen's doctrine of "four knows" must be a fable. If there really is such a person right now, I guarantee that he is 100% an idiot, and few people would not laugh at him! Because at this time and in this place, the measure of a person's character is the measure of their money and property. As long as you have money, no one dares to ask how it was acquired.

Mencius had an even more wonderful saying, saying something about preserving the night qi, preserving the morning qi. Morning is still debatable, but what is the use of this night qi besides making us shiver? Although night qi has a slight sense of coolness, it only makes the brains of those cannibals sharper and more meticulous. It will never make them have the slightest bit of reflection, I can say for sure. Perhaps because of this, there is the saying "If you have never done anything wrong in your life, you won't be startled by a knock on the door in the middle of the night." In reality, because people always do wrong, and they do it especially at night—"Set fires when the wind is high, and kill people when the moon is dark"—so that is why ghosts are born at night. It's as if when night falls, the universe is no longer ruled by humans, but by a monster that specializes in opposing humans. I don't know if these kinds of ghosts are in desolate mountains and wild graves, or in the shady corners of battlefields, but they definitely live in people's hearts. Or even further, the person who is afraid of ghosts is himself the fiercest and most evil ghost.

In this case, it is undeniable that night is the world of ghosts. We can view the gentlemen and adults, the officials in ceremonial attire, in this way. They are all withered like dead people during the day, but at night they are happy like madmen. Luo Liangfeng's "Pictures of Ghosts for Fun" probably includes this kind of treasure. When we read "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," we see so many romantic stories of the night that it makes us want to be neighbors with ghosts and foxes. No wonder the "mulberry student" on "Lotus Fragrance" proudly said: "If a male ghost comes, I have a sharp sword; if a female ghost comes, I will open the door and welcome her." The ghosts in these stories are much more interesting than people. These ghosts may not need to specialize in "night tours" and might as well have a competition with living people in broad daylight.

Burning oil to continue studying is originally an encouragement to people to work hard. In fact, this doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be a bookworm and really devote yourself to it. It probably also includes the meaning of enjoying yourself in time. This is why Li Bai's "Spring Night Banquet at the Peach and Plum Garden" has become a masterpiece for thousands of years. Moreover, what is the ultimate goal of studying for people today, just like the ancients? Only with today's "using the night to continue the day" can there be tomorrow's "using the night to paint." Haven't you seen those vigorous individuals who were once like clouds in their youth, but now they have all become the main characters who open rooms in big hotels for overnight stays?

Night, night, night, the night with "promising signs," the golden night! I will sing and praise it without reservation.

### Yu Dafu's Poems

— Maoren

The "Free Talk" section often publishes old-style poems, and every time after reading them, I inexplicably recall Mr. Yu Dafu's old-style poems. Mr. Yu wrote quite a few old-style poems, but I only have one of his handwritten "Miscellaneous Affairs in Qingdao" poems, which was given to me by a friend:

A clear island in ten thousand tons of waves, precisely because of the righteousness of the dead soldiers,
Now Liu Yu calls himself Emperor of Qi, singing of peace to cover up the despoiling of their homes.

I also remember another poem of his:

The disturbances in the Central Plains have not yet ceased, and safety and danger are linked to the small island of Yingzhou.
The women have not changed their Tang attire, and the elders still think of the Han crown and robes.
Suddenly it is reported that the red flag is hung on the Qin Pass, and I alone worry that a great calamity is coming to the clear stream.
The son of Jing Sheng will end up as a pig or dog, and Emperor Yu also had the surname Liu that year.

There is no lack of people in the world who love Yu's poems. Recently, I read Wu Dianjun's article "Zheng Ziyu Compiles and Prints Dafu's Collection of Poems and Lyrics" in the "Xin Bao" of the twenty-sixth year [of the Republic], May 27th, which briefly states that Zheng Ziyu, a young poet from Xiamen, and Yu Dafu, who came to Xiamen from Taiwan, discussed in a cafe the possibility of compiling a collection of old-style poems by modern Chinese writers. Later, due to the difficulty in collecting materials, only a collection of Dafu's poems and lyrics was compiled. Yu Dafu originally introduced Zheng to Professor Kanda, a Chinese literature expert at the Japanese Imperial University, but Zheng considered the sales problem and planned to publish it domestically. He is currently writing letters to an editor at a certain bookstore in Shanghai and a certain professor at a certain university in Peiping to discuss this. On June 16th, the "Xin Bao" again had an article by Zheng Ziyu, discussing Yu's old-style poems, but not mentioning whether the publication of the Dafu's collection of poems and lyrics he edited had been finalized.

There is an extremely interesting point in Zheng's article, saying: "Since he (Yu) came to Fujian last year to become an official, the Shanghai tabloids have all scolded him for 'losing his integrity.'" It is impossible to investigate which tabloid is mentioned here, but if what he said is true, it can be known that some people have already regarded Yu Dafu's position as a councilor within the territory of his own country as "losing his integrity." Even more interesting is that Zheng, who compiled Yu's poems and lyrics, seems to be very afraid that Yu will truly "lose his integrity," saying that Yu's poem "Following the Rhyme of the Inscription on the Fishing Terrace" is a work of "repeatedly defending" his loss of integrity, and citing the line "The ashes in the pit have not yet cooled, waiting to raise dust," saying: "If this sentence is true, then Mr. Yu Dafu still has hope!" Now that Yu has died in a foreign land and no longer "loses his integrity" to become an official, he will probably not disappoint Zheng's expectations! The original poem, according to Zheng's recording, is:

At the end of the year, I am extremely poor, and a certain government official took pity on my poverty and asked me to write an article, so I followed the rhyme of the inscription on the Fishing Terrace to answer:

After ten thousand calamities, I am frail and ill, and although my name is still there, it is no longer real.
I am ashamed that Bao Shu can take pity on me, and I am only afraid that Guan Fu will scold me.
The mud horse is proud but ultimately lacks bones, the ashes in the pit have not yet died, waiting to raise dust.
The "Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals" should be passed down in the country, why must Chen Xiong play Qin again?

### The Crane of Huang Garden

— Zheng Yimei

Recently, this publication carried Half-Dream Old Man's "Poetic Record of Crane Dance," with splendid writing. Reciting it, I cannot stop for a long time. The old man said that he and Qian Meng visited Huang Garden together to observe the crane dance. Now I don't know if the crane is still there, etc. Is Qian Meng the same as Mr. Shi Qing? If so, he is indeed a friend of my youth. Huang Garden is a place I often visit. Every time I have a day off, I go to see the flowers and taste tea, and have a half-day of pleasant conversation with the garden owner, Yue Yuan. I use it to wash away the dust of the world. The crane has a head full of spiritual sand, and its feathers are as white as snow. When it sees guests, it often dances gracefully, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, sometimes bending over, sometimes looking up, sometimes like smoke rising, sometimes like clouds floating, and it claps its wings to make a sound, occasionally interspersing with clear cries. The old man feeds it things like perch and loach every day, in a very large quantity, spending more than two catties a day, and the monthly cost is considerable. It is said that this crane was originally a domestic bird of the Xu Garden in northern Shanghai. Later, it was captured by the Hermit of White Dragon Mountain. The Hermit lived in Zhizhi Garden in the southern city and kept two cranes, male and female, to use as models for painting "Pine and Crane" pictures. Unexpectedly, in a certain cold winter, the female crane suddenly fell ill and died. The male crane lost its partner, and its diet decreased sharply, no less than Feng Qian's grief. The hermit couldn't bear to see its decline, so he gave the male crane to the Poor People's Vocational Training Center to raise. However, the Vocational Training Center sought production. Now raising a crane not only did not contribute to production, but also had a large expense of crane feed, which was difficult to maintain. Yue Yuan knew this and asked about the price. The person in charge said that public property could not be sold. If you truly love it, please donate ten dan of rice to exchange for it. At that time, rice was ten yuan per dan, costing a total of one hundred gold. Yue Yuan instructed a gardener to carry it back in a cage. The cage was carried on a rickshaw. The crane spread its wings out of the cage, and as the rickshaw wheels turned, its wings were injured. The gardener was rude and did not know it, so to this day, one wing is still drooping and has not healed, which is a regrettable matter. The poem about the fishing terrace is:

It's not that I cherish my body before the wine, pretending to be crazy inevitably becomes real.
Once I whipped a famous horse while drunk, I fear that too much affection will burden beautiful women.
The disasters in the southeast are the sins of heaven, the cocks crow, the wind and rain stir up dust in the sea.
What is the use of singing evil songs and crying in pain? Righteous men all talk about Emperor Qin.

Yu's old-style poems are really very good. I simply transcribe another poem recorded by Zheng:

I recklessly threw gold to buy A Jiao, when poor, I blew the xiao again in Wu Market.
The sound of the xiao travels far across the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, blowing to the Twenty-Four Bridges in Yangzhou.

### A Stone in the Garbage Heap

— Ruzi

One day, the great Italian artist Michelangelo was strolling on the streets of Florence when he saw a piece of famous Carrara marble from the Carrara quarry in a garbage heap beside the street. It was discarded and unused by some sculptor or worker because it was damaged. Michelangelo became interested in this white marble, walked over and carefully examined it. After thinking for a while, he felt that although the stone had been damaged, it was a pity to discard it, so he ordered the workers to move the stone back. Not long after, Michelangelo's masterpiece "David" that caused a sensation in the art world was born. It turned out that it was carved from this stone in the garbage heap.

"A good craftsman does not waste material," as can be seen from this. What is eaten is grass, what is squeezed out is milk, this is the greatness of the artist. Material conditions are the same, but the height of art can be seen from the method and technique.

### Writer

— Jin Lin

A writer's ability to gain our affection and concern lies in their unveiling of their soul to us. — Leo Tolstoy

A work is built on the author's profound honesty. If you try to deceive people with your work, the first person deceived is yourself. — Maxim Gorky

A writer should offer readers their works as a host would treat guests with a grand feast, ensuring that the guests still have an aftertaste in their mouths upon departure and want "another round." Only then can the work be considered successful. — Jean-Jacques Rousseau

### Radio Made in Twenty Seconds

British wireless radio manufacturing has seen rapid progress recently. In the city of Walden on the River Thames, there is a wireless radio factory that can now produce everything mechanically, requiring absolutely no human labor. The factory has a 70-foot-long tubular machine, managed by electronics. One end of this "tube" "swallows" the various components "sent" from another machine, and then rows of neatly assembled wireless radios are constantly "spit out" from the other end of this "tube"—it only takes twenty seconds to produce a high-quality radio. (As you wish)

During the 16th century, the struggle between the old and new religions in Europe was fierce, involving politics and international affairs, resulting in extremely cruel killings and unrest. All of France was in turmoil, with no peaceful days throughout the year and no tranquil land. England was also repeatedly caught in the whirlpool. Queen Elizabeth I, however, uniquely pacified the country with calmness and peace, and guarded it with a firm defense, blocking external disturbances, thereby enabling the nation to recuperate, revitalize all industries, and develop both industry and commerce, creating a large middle class (Wealthy middle class) and laying the foundation for the country. As a result, she expanded maritime transport, with countless navigators advancing to all parts of the globe, encroaching on Spain's maritime rights and territories, and replacing them. With internal and external affairs supporting each other, the country became stronger and wealthier. Although small farmers suffered from annexation, they were ultimately protected by law, preventing major harm. At the same time, literature and art flourished. Shakespeare, Bacon, and Spencer's plays, literature, philosophy, and science all emerged during this period. Therefore, during her reign, in every aspect, talents and opportunities converged, collectively unleashing brilliant flowers. As for her personal unparalleled beauty and superior status, which are worthy of envy, they are merely secondary matters. How can the current Queen Elizabeth compare to even a fraction of her? Only recently, news from London has indicated that the British monarch will tour Australia, a long and distant journey, requiring the princess to act as regent, and only this point slightly resembles the former. The traditional British model dictates that both the prince and princess have "Heir" qualifications, and there is no shortage of examples.

England is the only monarchy among the major powers today, and its monarch, apart from the crown and ceremonial vanity, actually possesses the demeanor of an ordinary person in all rights and obligations. It is often said that the true meaning of "democracy" lies in the monarchy of England, which is indeed no exaggeration. This is why its monarchical system has endured and does not hinder the spirit of democracy, which is fundamentally different from the divine belief held by the Japanese Emperor. Among its historically famous monarchs, Elizabeth I and Queen Victoria (who also became Empress of India) each have their own merits. Compared to the Chinese historical figures renowned as the reigns of Cheng and Kang of Zhou, Wen and Jing of Han, and Kang and Qian of Qing, they are unsurpassed. Moreover, they were all women, and their glory for the country surpassed that of other male monarchs, which can be called a miracle. Chinese historical princesses had no possibility of participating in the imperial succession, because the patriarchal system was vastly different from the West. The so-called "daughters born outward," although being imperial blood, ultimately belonged to other surnames. Therefore, if problems arose with the emperor (either due to youth or other reasons preventing them from exercising political power), the empress dowager would come forward to seize power. Whether it was Empress Lü Zhi of Han, Empress Wu Zetian of Tang, or Empress Dowager Cixi of Qing, regardless of their notorious deeds that are difficult to compare with the illustrious merits of the British female rulers, their origins were also fundamentally different. They all became Queen because they "had a husband who was a monarch," not because they inherited the throne as a normal Queen. Therefore, their political power was seized during times of young rulers and national doubt. Cixi repeatedly established young emperors in order to "rule from behind the curtain," ultimately leading the Qing Dynasty to decline.

The puppet Manchu emperor Puyi, also known as Emperor Xuantong of the former Qing Dynasty, remained in the Forbidden City for more than ten years after abdicating in the Xinhai Revolution. He hired the English professor Reginald Johnston to teach him English and study Western learning, gradually becoming influenced by European customs. He adopted an English name, Henry, and the Lady Rong he married also possessed the style of a female student, and her English name was Elizabeth. Before the incident, the Shanghai-published "Yi Jing" magazine once featured their English-signed short notes, which were quite humorous. Although they admired the great names of Henry and Elizabeth of England, they seemed not to understand their deeds.
