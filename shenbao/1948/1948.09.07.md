### All Foreign Exchange Held by Commercial Banks Limited to Deposit with Central Bank by Tomorrow, President Explicitly States Violators Will Be Sanctioned

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The Central Party Headquarters held an expanded memorial week for the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen at 9:00 AM on the 6th. Over 700 people, including members of the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan belonging to the Kuomintang, attended. After leading the ceremony, President Chiang gave a speech on the recent currency reform and economic controls implemented by the government, as well as detailed instructions on how party comrades should work together with one heart and one mind to complete this major policy. The main points are summarized below:

In mid-August, the government, recognizing the severe economic fluctuations and soaring prices, deemed the nation to be in a state of emergency. To meet the needs of the people, it promulgated emergency measures, implemented currency reform, and controlled the economy. It has been two weeks since the implementation. Judging from the enthusiasm with which people across the country are exchanging for gold yuan, it is clear that the people's faith in the government is stronger than ever. This demonstrates that as long as the government thoroughly implements all measures related to suppressing bandits, quelling the rebellion, and managing the national economy and people's livelihood, the people will wholeheartedly support and follow them. This is most gratifying. As for the recent currency and economic implementation, as of the end of last week, the total value of gold, silver, foreign currency, and foreign exchange settlement certificates exchanged throughout the country was more than US$45 million. In addition, the foreign exchange transferred from the national banks and bureaus to the central bank amounted to US$116 million, bringing the total to US$160 million. Therefore, the reserve for the issuance of gold yuan will be even more substantial in the future.

However, there is still one problem: commercial banks are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude towards government decrees. They have not yet complied with the government's regulations to deposit their gold, silver, and foreign exchange with the central bank. It is also rumored that the board of directors of the Shanghai Banking Association plans to gather all banks and financial institutions in Shanghai to raise 10 million yuan to sell to the central bank, considering it a perfunctory gesture. This shows that the leaders of the Shanghai banking community have not changed their mindset from two or thirty years ago, only loving money and not the country, only knowing selfishness and not the people's livelihood, disregarding the disasters that the nation, the government, and the people are facing. At a time when the communist bandits are so rampant, the people are suffering so much, and especially when the officers and soldiers at the front are shedding blood and sacrificing themselves, the government is determined to implement this major reform in order to strengthen the power to suppress the rebellion and build the country. Its success or failure is truly related to the life and death of the nation. However, those who possess large amounts of gold, silver, and foreign exchange, especially several major banks, are so selfish, disregard laws, and lack a sense of righteousness. This is truly heartbreaking. This behavior is not only directly undermining the government's national policy of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation, but also indirectly aiding the communist bandits' internal rebellion. Since they do not love the country, the country will not tolerate them. Therefore, the government has instructed the responsible authorities in Shanghai to order all major commercial banks to register and deposit all their foreign exchange with the central bank by Wednesday of this week. If they continue to be evasive, wait and see, delay, or fabricate false accounts and fail to report and deposit truthfully, the government will have no choice but to handle the matter according to the law and take further measures to impose severe sanctions.

What is most gratifying about this currency reform is that the Premier of the Executive Yuan and the financial authorities planned meticulously and were courageous in taking responsibility. Moreover, the financial authorities personally transcribed all kinds of documents beforehand, not daring to delegate to subordinates. Their diligence and dedication are even more commendable. Unfortunately, on the eve of the announcement of the order, the order to suspend the operation of exchanges and other businesses had to be stamped by his secretary, resulting in a leak of secrets. However, this was entirely the responsibility of his secretary, and the secretary and related personnel have all been arrested. The government will certainly punish them severely according to the law. Unexpectedly, some newspapers took the opportunity to make a big issue out of it and severely criticized the financial authorities. This matter has already come to light, and it has nothing to do with the Minister of Finance. We cannot impose major accusations on him for his minor oversight in employing the wrong person and hinder the implementation of the government's economic policies.

### Government Continues to Deliberate on Improving the Treatment of Officers, Soldiers, and Public School Teachers, Raising Salaries Only After Increased Revenue is Secured

In addition, there is one more point to be clarified, that is, the issue of the treatment of officers, soldiers, and public school teachers throughout the country. In recent years, public school teachers and officers and soldiers have suffered extreme hardship in their lives due to the depreciation of the legal tender. The government has never forgotten this. In this currency reform, the executive and financial authorities originally intended to increase the treatment of public school teachers by a certain percentage compared to the current level. However, after calculating the budget revenue and expenditure figures, it was simply impossible to implement. Because the key to the success or failure of this currency reform lies in whether the budget revenue and expenditure figures can be relatively close to balanced. If the current salary levels of 41 yuan to 300 yuan are increased by 25 percent (currently 20 percent), then the annual expenditure will increase by 150 million gold yuan. If it is increased to 30 percent, then it will increase to a huge amount of 300 million gold yuan. Therefore, this problem could not be solved at that time. However, the government is still anxiously thinking and carefully considering how to increase this revenue in order to achieve the goal of increasing the treatment of public school teachers. Because only after revenue is secured can expenditures be increased, so as to avoid repeating the past mistakes of legal tender inflation. In short, this currency reform must first establish the credibility of the new currency in order to stabilize prices, and then the treatment of public school teachers can be truly improved and increased. But what can be gratifying to all comrades is that this adjustment of treatment has almost restored the pay of army soldiers to pre-war levels, and the basic amount of salaries and wages for public school teachers has been increased from 30 yuan to 40 yuan. The lives of low-level personnel have also been adequately satisfied. I think that for this point, all of our senior public school teachers will feel more gratified than improving their own treatment.

### Encourage the Promotion of Diligence, Thrift, and Economy

In short, during the period of internal strife, external troubles, revolution, and national construction in any country, its government, especially the revolutionary party members, must "grit their teeth and tighten their belts" to encourage the people to be self-reliant in difficult circumstances in order to fulfill their responsibility of revitalizing and building the country. Recalling the 21st year of the Republic of China, that is, after the September 18th Incident, when I was suppressing bandits in Wuhan and Jiangxi, I led all the civil and military personnel with two slogans, which were to "have one person do the work of two people, and have two people eat the food of one person." Today, after eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, followed by the rebellion of treacherous bandits, production stagnation, and economic devastation, the environment is even more difficult. Our party comrades should "grit their teeth and tighten their belts," endure hunger and cold, and endure suffering and pain to set an example for the people of the country, in order to mobilize the people of the country to jointly complete this arduous mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country. Therefore, I believe that the significance of this currency reform is not only in economic reform, but also has a greater impact on politics and society. However, the starting point of any political or social reform lies in "eliminating waste and advocating thrift," because "extravagance is the root of national subjugation, and waste is the great enemy of national construction." If this great enemy cannot be overcome, then even with all kinds of superior conditions, the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country cannot be completed. Therefore, during economic reform, we must simultaneously promote the "diligence and thrift movement." Only diligence can increase production, and only thrift can reduce consumption. Only in this way can we save China's current poverty. I hope that all comrades can advocate this movement, eliminate the decadent trend of extravagance and waste and the old habits of complacency and procrastination, promote the spirit of diligence, thrift, speed, and certainty, lead the people, transform society, change the atmosphere, and achieve our goal of self-reliance and seeking strength.

### Foreign Exchange Declaration and Registration are Not Related to Capital Increase

[Our Newspaper] President mentioned yesterday (6th) in his address at the memorial week of the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters, that the Shanghai banking community intended to raise ten million foreign currency units to deposit with the Central Bank as a favor to the government, which was a violation of orders and was regrettable. It has been learned that the details of this matter are roughly as follows: After the government decided to order commercial banks to increase their capital to 500,000 gold yuan, some old banks in Shanghai cited the difficulty of increasing capital in proportion to the original shareholders and consulted the financial authorities for alternative solutions. These few commercial banks, which possess large amounts of foreign exchange, should declare and register this huge amount of foreign exchange in accordance with the law, which is absolutely unrelated to the increase in capital. It is rumored that a certain tycoon in the banking community once asked the authorities to allow several banks to raise US$8 million (it is said that the authorities hoped for US$15 million) to deposit with the Central Bank, and the gold price obtained from the sale would be used as the shareholders' capital increase, and they attempted to retain the large amount of foreign exchange they possessed without further declaration. This is obviously an act of defying the law. It is likely that the President has received a secret report about this negotiation.

### Commercial Banks in Beiping and Tianjin are Willing to Exchange Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency

Zhang Lisheng's Return to Nanjing is Still Pending

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 6th] Zhang Lisheng convened representatives of national and commercial banks in Beiping and Tianjin at 5:00 PM on the 6th to persuade them to exchange their existing gold and foreign currency for national currency. After the meeting, Vice President Zhang told reporters that the representatives of the banks all expressed their willingness to comply with the regulations, but were concerned about whether the government would inquire about the source of the gold and foreign currency after the exchange. Zhang said that there would be no inquiry, and urged them to quickly submit the figures of their existing assets and consult with the national banks to handle the matter. Zhang also said that foreign banks are very cooperative with the currency reform. Banks such as HSBC exchange foreign currency with the national banks every day. He will convene a similar meeting with money houses on the 7th to persuade them. Zhang's return to Nanjing is still pending. Wang Fuzhou will fly to Shanghai on the 7th and then to Nanjing before flying to Wuhan to attend the funeral.

### Stocks of All State-Owned Enterprises Scheduled for Issuance on the 9th and Listing on the 10th

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Regarding the issuance of stocks of state-owned enterprises, the Ministry of Finance convened a meeting of relevant agencies on the morning of the 6th, attended by Li Jinglu, Director of the Department of Navigation Administration of the Ministry of Communications, Deng Hanliang, Director of the Department of Commerce of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and representatives of the National Resources Commission, etc., presided over by Vice Minister of Finance Li Tang. It was decided that the stocks of all state-owned enterprises will be issued on the 9th and listed on the 10th. Before the issuance, the stocks will be delivered to the Central Bank, and then the Central Bank will entrust the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank to sell them. They will be issued simultaneously in Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Chongqing, and Tianjin, and are scheduled to be completed within one and a half months. The stocks are divided into five types: one share, five shares, ten shares, one hundred shares, and one thousand shares.

### He Yingqin Will Fly to Beiping

Possible Trip to Northeast

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] He Yingqin will fly to Beiping within one or two days for his first inspection since taking office as Minister of National Defense, and may also travel to the Northeast. Official sources revealed that after He's inspection of the north, the President's plan to inspect the north will be cancelled.

### Members of the Issuance Reserve Supervision Committee Should Include Representatives of Public Opinion

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The Control Yuan's supervisory committee believes that the selection of members for the Issuance Reserve Supervision Committee, which was established by the government for currency reform and the issuance of gold yuan, lacks impartiality and should include representatives from public opinion organizations. During the second meeting of the Finance and Grain Administration Committee of the Yuan on the 6th, it was decided to propose an amendment. The reason for the amendment is that "the selection of members for the Issuance Reserve Supervision Committee only includes official representatives and representatives from the Shanghai financial community. It is unreasonable to represent the entire country in this way. It is proposed that the government make reasonable improvements to show great faith." In addition, regarding the standard for paying salaries to public school teachers in gold yuan, it is proposed that the government make reasonable adjustments to improve administrative efficiency. It was decided to appoint five committee members, Hu Wenhui, Yang Zongpei, Sun Yulin, Wang Guanwu, and Duan Kechang, to conduct investigations with the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance, collect sufficient information, and then decide whether to propose a correction.

[Another Dispatch] During the adjustment of the Control Yuan's Finance and Grain Committee on the 6th, the issue of salary standards for public school teachers was discussed, which aroused heated debate. The committee originally intended to propose a correction immediately, with two principles attached: (1) The government should refer to the current price situation and take into account the actual living needs of public school teachers, and make reasonable adjustments as soon as possible. (2) When the financial situation improves, the treatment of public school teachers should be restored to pre-war standards immediately. Committee members Hu Wenhui, Liu Xingzhi, and Sun Yulin spoke successively, with some advocating for the immediate proposal of a correction, and others advocating for a postponement and investigation. No resolution was reached, and it was decided to conduct an investigation first, and to consult with President Weng and Finance Minister Wang for discussion before making a final decision.

### Control Yuan's Taiwan Inspection Delegation Scheduled to Depart Around the 20th

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The Control Yuan's Taiwan inspection delegation of ten people has decided to depart around the 20th of this month and stay in Taiwan for more than one month, returning to Nanjing after the Taiwan Retrocession Day (October 25th).

After arriving in Taiwan, they will conduct various investigation and inspection work separately. During the meeting on the 6th, Taiwan-籍Control Yuan member Bing Nian-tai gave a simple report on the recent political situation in Taiwan in great detail.

### The Northeast Military Food and Civilian Food Supply Can Be Ensured Within Six Months

Wei Lihuang is Optimistic About the Battle Situation

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 6th] Wei Lihuang talked about the battle situation and said: In the past six months, we have driven the bandits out of the surrounding strongholds of Shenyang. From March to June, the national army here adopted the strategy of "using the big to eat the small, and using the fast to eat the slow" to eliminate 35 battalions of bandits. In terms of economy, Wei said that he is determined to eliminate the black market and stabilize prices.

### President Telegraphed Yu Bin in Response to Concerns About the Situation in Changchun

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Recently, Yu Bin and more than 50 members of the Legislative Yuan, Control Yuan, and National Assembly representatives from the nine provinces and three cities of the Northeast submitted a joint petition to the President, stating that Changchun has been surrounded for 15 months, with land and air blocked, and there is a severe food shortage. Autumn has arrived, and the severe cold of minus 40 degrees in winter will inevitably lead to the starvation and freezing to death of soldiers and civilians. They felt an urgent crisis and jointly requested the President to concentrate air transport resources, airdrop food, and take other effective measures. The words were earnest. It is heard that the President has sent a reply telegram to Yu Bin and other representatives, saying: "All of you are loyal and enthusiastic in protecting your hometown and loving the country. Your opinions will be actively implemented to relieve the siege of the soldiers and civilians in Changchun."

### Economic Cooperation Administration Continues to Allocate Funds, China Receives More Than Eight Million Yuan

[United Press, Washington, 6th] The Economic Cooperation Administration revealed on the 6th that in the week ending September 1st, the agency approved 134,057,763 yuan to assist in the recovery plans in China and Europe.

### Zhang Qun Returned to Tokyo Yesterday and Will Meet with MacArthur Again Before Returning Home

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] Zhang Qun returned to Tokyo on the morning of the 6th from Kyoto after touring major cities in the Kansai region for five days. According to sources close to Zhang, he will meet with MacArthur at least twice more before returning home this weekend. Zhang visited the Kansai region with Shang Zhen, Shao Yulin, and Lin Dingping last Wednesday, visiting Iwakuni, Hiroshima, Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto, Lake Biwa, and Nara in five days. He attended several gatherings of overseas Chinese and held talks with the occupation authorities, the Japanese authorities, and Japanese business tycoons. Zhang has repeatedly stated that he is visiting Japan in a private capacity, but the occupation authorities and the Japanese side still believe that his visit is of great significance. Because Zhang has served as the Premier of the Executive Yuan and is an expert on Japanese issues, his suggestions to the government after returning home will have a significant impact on China's future policy toward Japan.

### Public Utilities, Coal, and Gasoline Maintain August 19th Prices, Economic Control Commission Orders Strengthened Anti-Smuggling Measures and Crackdown on Black Market Hong Kong Exchange Rates

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Premier of the Executive Yuan Weng Wenhao convened an ad hoc meeting of the Economic Control Commission at 4:30 PM on the 6th at the Premier's residence, attended by Wang Yunwu, Yu Hongjun, Wang Shijie, Chen Qitian, and Xu Baiyuan to exchange views on the current situation of implementing the financial and economic emergency decree and the financial and economic issues that should be addressed. The meeting lasted for about two hours and ended around 6:30 PM. As a result of the exchange of views, the following points were decided: (1) Foreign exchange assets of all commercial banks should be deposited with the Central Bank in the short term. The Central Bank and the commercial banks will negotiate the implementation techniques, which must be implemented earnestly and conscientiously. (2) All public utilities are still not allowed to raise prices. Requests to adjust the prices of coal and gasoline are not approved and should still maintain the prices of August 19th. However, the price of gasoline for private cars may be reasonably adjusted to meet the meaning of cracking down on private cars. The prices of oil for military, public, and transportation businesses are not allowed to increase. (3) Strengthen anti-smuggling measures. Effective measures should be taken to crack down on black market Hong Kong exchange rates. The economic supervisors in Shanghai and Guangdong should be instructed to handle the matter conscientiously. During the meeting, Chen Qitian reported in detail on the methods for issuing stocks of state-owned enterprises, but no discussion was held.

### Suspicious Death of Feng Yuxiang? Qin Dechun Said It Seems "Hard to Believe", Soviet Ship Refused Turkish Inspection When Passing Through Straits

[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] Official sources here on the 6th maintained a reserved attitude towards the news of Feng Yuxiang's death by burning, but were apparently not particularly shocked by it. Qin Dechun, former subordinate of Feng Yuxiang and current Vice Minister of National Defense, said that the government was not particularly concerned about Feng's attempts to participate in the Communist rebellion. He also said that the circumstances of Feng's death by burning, as reported, apparently seemed "hard to believe." Another senior official, who did not want to be named, said: "TASS's report may be fabricated to make the people forget Feng."

[Central News Agency, New York, 5th, United Press] The U.S. State Department declined to comment on Feng Yuxiang's death by burning. A State Department spokesman said that President Chiang had revoked Feng's government position in January of this year due to his disloyal behavior.

[United Press, Moscow, 5th] It was announced here on the 5th that the Soviet ship "Pobeda" had been towed to the port of Odessa on the 4th, carrying the bodies of General Feng Yuxiang and his daughter and others who were burned to death on board.

[Central News Agency, Ankara, 5th] TASS announced that international sources in the Middle East familiar with Chinese affairs were shocked by Feng Yuxiang's death by burning on a Soviet ship. The Soviet side kept the news of Feng's boarding the "Pobeda" to the Soviet Union extremely secret. When the ship passed through the Bosphorus Strait and entered the Black Sea on August 31, the captain arrogantly disregarded the navigation rules. The Turkish authorities repeatedly signaled it to stop for inspection, but were refused. Finally, it was forcibly stopped. The ship claimed that it was unaware of the rules for passing through the strait. Chinese diplomats stationed in Turkey, in addition to being surprised by the news, sarcastically said: "Unable to say goodbye to him, how sad and regrettable!"

[United Press, Berkeley, California] According to Feng Yuxiang's son, there were three of his sisters who accompanied Feng on the ship to the Soviet Union.

### Transfer of Focus in Yongsha Stock Dumping Case: Xu Baiqi Arrested and Interrogated; Rumors of Several Important Figures Arrested in Shanghai

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Following the shift in focus in the Yongsha stock dumping case, Xu Baiqi, Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, a key suspect accused of leaking information and instigating the dumping, was arrested by the Capital Police Department's Criminal Investigation Team at 3:30 AM on the 6th. On the 5th, during the interrogation of Tao Qiming by the Criminal Investigation Team and the Supervisory Committee, Tao confessed that he was instructed by Xu to dump Yongsha shares. Subsequently, the Police Department decided to carry out the arrest at 8:00 PM on the 5th, but due to incomplete arrest procedures, the execution was postponed until the morning of the 6th. At 3:00 AM, Zheng Haoming, the head of the Criminal Investigation Team, along with several detectives, went to the Ministry of Finance and arrested Xu at the Minister's office building. Throughout the 6th, Xu was interrogated by members of the Supervisory Committee and Zheng Haoming, the head of the Criminal Investigation Team. The personnel guarding Xu Baiqi in his confinement at the Ministry of Finance Minister's office building were completely withdrawn on the 6th, and the Ministry of Finance has returned to its usual quiet state.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The main lead in the Tao Qiming case has shifted to Xu Baiqi. On the 6th, rumors circulated in the capital that other relevant personnel in the Ministry of Finance had left Beijing upon hearing the news. Our reporter specifically interviewed Finance Minister Wang Yunwu to inquire about this matter. Wang stated, "I am not aware of such a matter." The reporter asked, "To the best of Minister Wang's knowledge, are there no other personnel in the Ministry of Finance involved besides Xu Baiqi?" Wang replied, "That is correct." The reporter further inquired about his thoughts on the Xu Baiqi affair. Wang stated, "The matter has been handed over to the judicial authorities, who will handle it impartially. I have no further comments."

[Our Dispatch] There has been a new development in the Tao Qiming case. Based on Tao's confession, the Capital Police Department dispatched officers to Shanghai on the evening of the 5th, who, in conjunction with a local municipal agency, began arresting several important individuals involved yesterday.

Editorial

### Production Promotion Above All!

Before the announcement of the New Economic Reform Plan, we said that restoring credit was paramount. Now that the plan has been announced, we must say that promoting production is above all!

Since Chiang Ching-kuo, the Economic Supervisor of Shanghai, wielded an iron fist to strengthen economic inspections, crack down on hoarding, and eliminate the black market, prices have plummeted in less than ten days. This symptomatic treatment can be said to have been truly successful, and this uncompromising style is a preliminary manifestation of the government's determination to reform since the victory, which is worthy of praise. However, the ultimate solution to economic problems still depends on reasonable economic measures, and political power can only address immediate needs. The fundamental of reasonable economic measures is nothing more than striving to increase production.

Logically speaking, various production enterprises should now seize the new atmosphere of reduced interest rates and stable wages, which are conducive to production, and strive to increase production. However, according to business figures, new difficulties and problems are emerging one after another, and still require the cooperation of the government and the people to effectively resolve them. In order to draw the authorities' serious attention to the truth of the matter, we cannot help but specifically and roughly point out a few issues, even at the risk of sounding alarmist:

1.  The price limits imposed on August 19 cannot be considered entirely reasonable. This is because before that day, the prices of some goods had just been adjusted and implemented not long ago; some prices had been negotiated and adjusted, and had been under discussion for a long time but had not been implemented when the freezing order came into effect. For the latter category of industries, this is tantamount to missing an opportunity and suffering losses. The more they produce in the future, the greater the losses, and it will naturally be difficult to stimulate their initiative.

2.  The exchange rate for US dollars on August 19 was 7.8 to 8.5 million legal tender (fabi), plus approximately 460,000 yuan for listed foreign exchange, totaling only 8.2 to 8.3 million yuan. However, the newly set exchange rate is four gold yuan per US dollar, which is effectively increased to 12 million legal tender. This means that the cost of foreign raw materials required by factories has indeed risen by slightly less than one-third. However, they are required to sell finished products at the limited price, and are not allowed to increase the price proportionally. The losses are too great, and it will naturally be difficult to maintain their re-production, let alone increase production.

3.  Many raw materials still come from bandit areas or military zones. Naturally, price limits cannot be discussed when purchasing them, and the costs are impossible to predict due to rampant panic buying and smuggling, which are fraught with difficulties. If fixed price limits are enforced in the sales areas without reasonable compensation, people will inevitably be reluctant to move forward. As a result of reduced procurement and transportation, and reduced sources, there is a risk of work stoppages and production cuts.

4.  Various taxes and fees are being adjusted successively according to pre-war standards, and there are many other tax increase measures still under consideration by the central or local governments. In addition, there are various kinds of obligatory donations of grain seeds that are neither entirely public nor entirely private, which do not end with the price limits. Since passing on the costs is no longer effective, and the burden still falls on the shoulders of businesses, the situation for industries is even more difficult than before.

5.  In the past, even amid inflation and extreme hardship, businesses had special methods to make up for their losses, such as obtaining low-interest loans, fully stockpiling raw materials, competing for quotas, and arbitrage. These were all obvious facts. Now, although interest rates are low, lending has stopped, quotas have been reduced, and arbitrage is impossible. The quantity and date of storage of both raw materials and finished products are also subject to strict restrictions. In the eyes of the production sector, these are undoubtedly unfavorable factors.

6.  In the past, prices between production and sales in various industries had their natural adjustments, without the need for government intervention. However, after the government universally implemented price limits, it has not yet clearly stipulated how to demarcate factory prices, wholesale prices, and retail prices, or the distance between each. The government has also not stipulated corresponding measures for how to convert the purchase price in the producing area, plus various transportation and sales expenses and legal profits, into the market price in the sales area. As a result, costs do not match, factories are unwilling to release goods, replenishment is difficult, retailers have no profit to gain, and transportation merchants are standing idly by. The reason why there is an abundance of idle capital, and the situation of overabundance is frequently severe, while the market is sluggish and large transactions have not been conducted as usual, lies in this. If this situation persists without active guidance, it is feared that industry will not be able to develop, and the market will be difficult to prosper.

The above situations are not us worrying about the sky falling, or moaning without illness, nor are we saying that everything can be solved after revising the price limits. However, the fact is that the coordination is not completely reasonable and the implementation is not smooth. The relevant authorities seem to have noticed this and are working on various active measures, such as the issuance of shares by China Textile Industries Corporation (CTIC) and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC), and the separate sales of materials by materials agencies. However, we believe that this is not enough. The most important thing is that idle capital should be collected and further transformed into long-term industrial capital for the proper use of economic construction, which will help increase production. Otherwise, if the funds are withdrawn with the left hand and released again with the right hand for purely consumptive purposes, this will not be very effective in channeling idle capital, and it will have nothing to do with increasing production. It must be understood that if used well, idle capital is production capital; if not used well, the original production capital may gradually turn into idle capital.

As for selling materials to suppress prices and increase supply, this has been a consistent policy since the victory. However, to achieve effective suppression, it is necessary to resolutely achieve several points: (1) Abandon the principle of revenue first and adopt a flat-price policy. Especially when strictly enforcing price limits, the selling price must leave ample room so that merchants who buy in can obtain legitimate expenses and profits; otherwise, it will be impossible to adhere to the price limits. (2) The quantity should be large and the locations should be scattered. Implementing sales only in Shanghai has limited effect, and designating a place in Shanghai for retail sales is only a symbolic action, creating opportunities for scalpers, and probably has little to do with suppressing prices. (3) If the materials being sold are raw materials or semi-finished products, it is best to closely coordinate with the industrial sector and allocate them systematically to expand their production role and to show that the handling is open and the procedures must be swift and the pricing must be reasonable.

Regarding how to ensure the steady outflow of raw materials from the inland areas and the mutual exchange with manufactured goods in the cities, this point is particularly worth emphasizing. Otherwise, if each region acts independently and obstructs each other, the national economy will regress to a tribal economy. If the goods cannot be transported out, the rural areas will become more depressed, exports will not be able to expand, and the urban industries will eventually be unable to sustain themselves. When industry and commerce stagnate and materials are scarce, it will be more difficult to save the situation. Economic matters cannot be solved solely by political means, and all economic controls must be planned and promoted comprehensively. If only the negative aspects are focused on, it will naturally still be a temporary symptomatic treatment. Even if it is done perfectly and the existing materials in the warehouse are used as much as possible, neglecting the exchange of materials may not achieve the goal of increasing production. Therefore, we would like to offer the authorities a solution: production promotion above all!

### Our Government Is Making Concrete Efforts to Break the Impasse in Sino-Japanese Trade: Interview with the Head of the Trade Group of the Delegation to Japan

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] Tang Jusheng, the head of the trade group of our delegation to Japan, said on the morning of the 6th that the Chinese government is currently making concrete efforts to break the impasse in Sino-Japanese trade. Tang returned here on the 4th of this month after consulting with the central authorities on the situation of Sino-Japanese trade for three months. He said that when the Chinese government revises its trade policy towards Japan, it is expected to relax the quota system as much as possible so that private traders can choose from a variety of import and export goods. Tang continued that improvements would also be sought regarding the accounting of private traders. Detailed measures are being drafted. Tang also revealed that Chinese government agencies, such as the Resources Commission and the Salt Administration, will also be approved to hold commercial consultations directly with the Allied Headquarters in the short term. However, contracts signed as a result of such consultations will still need to be signed by the China Trust Bureau (CTB), as it is the only agency handling state-run trade between China and Japan. In the past, the bureau had represented several state-run agencies in our country in conducting the above-mentioned negotiations. He continued that a representative from the Salt Administration would arrive here from China soon, while the Resources Commission already has a representative here. Tang continued that to date, private traders in our country have made about 50 sales proposals to the Allied Headquarters, but only 20 have been accepted by the Allied Headquarters. He then said that in order to speed up the processing of transactions, the trade group of our delegation has requested the Allied Headquarters to clear all 30 proposals submitted before September 1 that have not been resolved, solely through the exchange of memorandums between the Allied Headquarters and our delegation. According to the new regulations implemented since August 15, the procedure of exchanging memorandums alone is not complete, and contracts must also be signed by the Japanese Trade Agency. As a result, there are more bureaucratic procedures. Tang expressed his hope that the Allied Headquarters would agree to the request of the trade group of our delegation.

### The Soviet Union Officially Suggests to the United Kingdom, the United States and France to Convene a Meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers to Discuss the Disposition of Former Italian Territories

[United Press, London, 5th] Moscow Radio broadcast on the 5th that the Soviet Union has officially suggested to the United Kingdom, the United States and France to convene a meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers before September 15 to discuss the question of the former Italian colonies. The broadcast continued that the Soviet Ambassadors in the United Kingdom, the United States and France have submitted a note to the three governments on the 4th, saying: "The Soviet government considers it necessary to convene a meeting of the Four Powers' Foreign Ministers before the deadline of September 15 stipulated in the Italian Peace Treaty, to discuss the question of the former Italian colonies in the order stated in the treaty." The US Peace Treaty stipulates that unless the question of the colonies is resolved by the Four Powers before September 15, this question should be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for resolution. The representatives of the Foreign Ministers could not reach an agreement on the disposal of the Italian-African territories, so after months of meetings, the representatives of the Foreign Ministers submitted different reports to their respective governments on August 31. The contents of the reports are now kept secret, and it is rumored that the reason for this is that the United Kingdom is deeply afraid that the publication of the reports will cause a widespread movement among the indigenous people of the colonies. The major colonies that are difficult to resolve are Libya in North Africa, Italian Somaliland and Tripolitania. These areas are currently maintained by the United Kingdom until the fate of these areas is decided.

[United Press, London, 6th] The Soviet government officially announced on the 6th that the Four Powers have not yet reached an agreement on the disposition of Italy's former possessions in Africa. The Moscow Radio station broadcasted the TASS news report, revealing for the first time that the Four Powers disagreed on the disposition of any part of the old Italian territories. It was previously reported that Westerners had expressed that the West had reached an agreement on the disposal of Italian Somaliland and Eritrea, but not on Libya. The United Kingdom, the United States and France, of course, have no way to object to the Soviet Union's suggestion to convene a meeting of the Foreign Ministers in principle, but the three countries are expected to argue that the time is too short. This Foreign Ministers' meeting has been considering the colonial question for several weeks, and the report to the Foreign Ministers was signed on August 31, but the contents of the report were kept secret. However, Western countries indirectly implied that although it is generally known that an agreement has not yet been reached, an agreement has already been reached on the East African territories.

### The Soviet Union Controls Another Loophole in Eastern Europe: The Polish Communist Party Takes the Tito Route; The Secretary General is Removed from Office and the President Concurrently Holds the Post

[United Press, Warsaw, 6th] A spokesman for the Polish government said on the 6th that the dismissal of Gomulka, Secretary General of the Polish Communist Party, became effective on the 5th, but Gomulka will continue to serve as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Recovered Territories. The government gazette announced that Polish President Bierut has concurrently held the post of Secretary General of the Communist Party to actively direct party affairs.

[United Press, London, 6th] Another loophole in Stalin's Eastern European secretary has emerged. Warsaw reports that not long after the loss of the Soviet Union and the Yugoslav Communist Party, an unhappy event of the same nature has occurred with the Polish Communist Party. It is reported that the Secretary General of the Polish Communist Party, Gomulka, has been removed from office for "national communist tendencies," which is the same charge as Marshal Tito.

To explain it in plain language, it is because Gomulka, like Tito, refused to loyally implement Stalin's line. Another reason for Gomulka's downfall is Poland's growing fear that the Soviet Union will deprive Poland of the territory in East Germany that it acquired at the Potsdam Conference, because the Soviet Union aims to build Germany into a communist country as a fortress against Western imperialism. Poland's occupation of East German territory is obviously inconsistent with this policy. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office said that Gomulka's dismissal was "another destruction of communist fantasies." Although Gomulka is not well-known in the West, he was the number one person in the Polish Communist Party when the Communist Information Bureau was established a year ago, and he was the chairman of the bureau with the newly deceased Soviet figure Zhdanov. However, Gomulka did not attend the bureau's meeting in June to expel Tito, and it seems that he and Tito were listed as "those who deviated from the line" for opposing the Soviet Union's policy of collectivization of land, and Gomulka especially opposed the Soviet Union's policy of rebuilding its old enemy Germany. For a long time, rumors have been circulating that Gomulka has lost Moscow's "favor." It was said in the summer that Gomulka was resting due to illness, but the new split in the Soviet bloc can no longer be concealed. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office also said that the Communist Party believes that "the Communist Party will rule the world, and the world will be peaceful," but the Gomulka incident shows that this is a big mistake. He said that this is nothing less than a head-on blow to Germany, because Gomulka's rise to power was planned by Moscow. He said that if the Slavic Communist Party is also unreliable, then other countries can be imagined. For example, if Germany is ruled by the Communist Party, its future can also be predicted.

[United Press, Berlin, 6th] Riotous communists broke into the Berlin City Hall today, forcing the City Council to cancel its meeting for the fourth time in two weeks. Afterwards, they held their own meeting to discuss openly seizing the city government, while the German police in the Soviet zone blockaded the City Hall, not allowing anyone to open it. After occupying the meeting place, the rioters held their own meeting to discuss winter relief measures and advocated incorporating the entire Berlin into the Soviet zone. The City Council will hold a meeting in the British zone in the afternoon of the 6th. When the riot occurred, the four military governors seemed to be close to an agreement to end the Berlin blockade, which had lasted for eighty days. The city council had ordered many strong men to protect the meeting, but they could not stop the communist masses. The Soviet police initially pretended to stop the rioters, but then stood by and watched. Acting Mayor Feilitenberg was later summoned to the Soviet headquarters, where the Soviet side told him that they would formally protest the City Council's guarding the City Hall with strong men.

### Republican Party Criticized on American Labor Day

Labor Leaders Act in Concert with the Democratic Party

[United Press, Washington, 6th] American labor leaders and senior Democratic leaders demanded the abolition of Taft-Hartley in Labor Day speeches on the 6th. The Harley Labor Act also blamed the Republican Party for the high prices in the United States. It is generally expected that President Truman will use this as an excuse to make a big fuss. The organized labor groups in the United States, led by the president of the Labor Federation, Green, and the Congress of Industrial Organizations, also attacked Taft-Hartley. The Harley Labor Act was attacked. They asked the three million members to use all their strength on election day to defeat every congressman who supports the new labor law. Government officials, including Labor Secretary Tobine, also participated in the attack on the bill, which he called: Taft-Hartley. The Harley Labor Act is "undemocratic and un-American" and "threatens labor-management relations and union security in a century. The 80th Congress controlled by the Republican Party dispersed the Department of Labor and "flatly refused to take effective action against high prices." The Deputy Secretary of Labor said in a speech at the Congress of Industrial Organizations in Duluth, Minnesota: The labor law advocated by the Republican Party has clearly shown who is a friend of labor and who is an enemy of labor. The Republican Party has not seen the mistakes on the road they are taking. The Republican Party did not ease anything in the anti-labor law in the platform adopted in Philadelphia. Deputy Secretary of Agriculture勃爾納, in a speech in Faber, Minnesota, accused the Republican Party of attempting to create unpleasantness between agriculture and labor with promises and insincere methods. At the same time, Attorney Clark also participated in the Labor Day political speech to support Truman's severe criticism of the Republican Congress in the November election.

The criticism of the achievements of the last Congress of the Republican Party is very severe. The article reads: President She Truman has made courageous efforts on the human rights bill. Although Stetson pointed out that President Truman should be responsible for high prices, I believe that Mr. Du has made various efforts in recent months to enlighten the people and suppress prices, which is better than those of Republican friends. I think that in terms of the six-body system, the Democratic Party can best protect the people's daily life and welfare.

### The Splendor of the Coronation of the Dutch Queen in Arnold Cathedral, Crowds Cheering All the Way to Catch a Glimpse of Her Grace

[Agence France-Presse, Amsterdam, 6th] Queen Juliana went to Arnold Cathedral for the coronation ceremony at 11:03 this morning. The people who cheered her were lined up all the way to the gate of the church. Although the weather was cloudy and there were raindrops from time to time, the crowd was still overcrowded. Some people even went out last night in order to find a better place to catch a glimpse of the new queen when she went to the church.

[Agence France-Presse, Amsterdam, 5th] Tonight, the whole city of Holland is illuminated by electric lights as if it were white.

The square in front of the palace was crowded with people, hoping to see the color of the new king, but Queen Juliana did not appear on the balcony, which was disappointing to the monarch.

In addition, European royal family members who have arrived here include Danish Prince Axel and Swedish Crown Prince Oscar.

### The National Federation of Trade Unions Holds its Annual Meeting, The Fate of the British Government is at Stake, Cripps Calls for Cooperation to Overcome Difficulties

[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] The annual meeting of the British Trade Union Congress, which includes representatives of various labor groups in Britain, will open in Margate tomorrow. It will be held for about a week, and many issues will be discussed, with particular emphasis on increasing production through joint action by employers and employees, the nationalization of the steel industry, wages and cost of living, and other matters. The debate seems to have a great relationship with the government's economic policy. One of the things that British workers are most dissatisfied with is that the government cannot curb the rising cost of living, while the labor cost freeze remains the same. British labor groups strongly claim that many industries have made more profits this year than last year, but workers have not enjoyed the benefits. The Trade Union Congress includes 188 trade unions, with a total of 7.8 million members, and more than 1.2 million women who are not members.

[United Press, Margate, 5th] The British economic dictator Cripps has been invited to represent the cabinet to speak about the seriousness of the British situation. Cripps will deliver a speech to the conference on the 6th, calling for a halt to requests for wage adjustments, and saying that the government's only hope of getting Britain through the current difficulties lies in workers accepting the government's long-term plan, which aims to lower prices so that workers have greater value in their wages, rather than increasing wages with the inevitable result of rising prices again. Cripps will also call for increased productivity, and he will probably achieve the greatest success in his career if he can overcome the dissenters. The Attlee government also admitted that if the conference's resolutions support the unanimous increase in wage demands, the fate of the Labor government may be sealed. Therefore, Cripps is a peace envoy. It is expected that if the labor organization opposes Cripps' plan to freeze wages and prices, it may cause voters to oppose the Labor Party in the next general election and ensure the Conservative Party's control.

### Soviet Representative on the Allied Control Council Again Attacks Japanese Labor Law, Holds News Conference at Soviet Embassy in Japan

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 6th] The Soviet representative on the Allied Control Council for Japan, in order to expand propaganda against MacArthur and the new labor policy of the Japanese government, held a special press conference at the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo this afternoon. Soviet representative Derevyanko and his propaganda director Popov expressed their views at the press conference, attacking MacArthur and the Japanese government, saying: Regarding the issue of Japanese trade union rights, MacArthur and the Japanese government have violated the policies jointly adopted by the Allied countries and the Far Eastern Commission.撰波夫 mentioned that the British representative Shaw criticized this measure, the purpose of which is to suppress Japanese civil servants and clearly pointed out that the policy and measures implemented by the occupation forces and the Japanese government are destroying the Potsdam Declaration and the decision-making of the Far Eastern Commission. 撰波夫 believes that it is astonishing why the Japanese government still believes that the letter is an instruction when Allied Control Council Chairman Sheppard announced that MacArthur's letter was a suggestion. In conclusion, Popov pointed out that the Soviet representative's attitude in the Allied Control Council has remained unchanged, and announced that MacArthur should cancel his June 22 instruction to the Japanese government to amend the Civil Service Law, and that the Japanese government should abolish the Cabinet Order of July 31 and stop taking repressive measures against Japanese civil servants.

### All Confiscated Hoarded Goods to be Sold; Supply Retailers at Limited Prices; This Week's Focus of Economic Inspection Work is Cracking Down on Black Market Transactions

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to news from the Economic Control Supervision Office: The city's economic inspection work is being actively carried out, and the central task this week is to crack down on black market transactions. Any transactions found to exceed the "August 19th" limited price will be severely punished.

A materials adjustment meeting will be held at 10:00 am today to conduct a comprehensive review of policies such as unblocking the sources of industrial raw materials in the future and selling off materials to stabilize prices.

More Than Six Hundred Tip-Off Letters Received

Since the Suppression and Construction Brigade began its service in this city a week ago, it has received more than six hundred tip-off letters. More than one hundred of them were of a serious nature and have been directly sent to Director Chen's office. The rest are accusations of small-scale hoarding cases and have been sent to the Municipal Police Bureau for handling. Among the tip-off letters, there are many anonymous letters. The Suppression and Construction Brigade hopes that all future tip-off letters will be signed to show responsibility. Furthermore, regarding the distribution of tip-off rewards, the original regulation stipulated that the informant would receive 35%, and the remaining 30% would go to the national treasury. However, due to objections from the Legislative Yuan, there may be changes in the future, so the distribution of this bonus has been temporarily suspended.

Fish and Vegetables Increase Prices in Disguise

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the authorities posted notices and strictly enforced the "August 19th" limited price, the prices of fish, meat, and vegetables in the small vegetable market were once stable. However, as time went on, various vegetable market stall merchants secretly implemented disguised price increases, taking advantage of the fact that housewives are easily deceived. For example, meat shops would reduce the weight of meat sold or force customers to buy bones and skin along with the meat. Fish stalls would only offer dead fish and old shrimp at the limited price, without fresh fish and shrimp. Gradually, if one wanted to buy good quality pork and fresh fish and shrimp, one had to resort to the black market. Many vegetable vendors do not even know that there is a limited price. Green vegetables and edamame beans are sold for 250,000 to 300,000 per pound, with loud shouting every day. According to unofficial statistics, the average salaried family spends more than 50% of its total income on daily side dishes. Now that salaries are fixed, and the prices of vegetables and other items in the vegetable market cannot be stabilized, the consequences are unimaginable if this continues.

### No Source of Jewelry; Jewelry Stores Reluctant to Operate

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the reopening of jewelry stores in this city, business has always been sporadic and has recently entered a state of having goods but no market.

However, the amount exchanged each morning is also very limited, with each person being allowed to exchange at most one mace (approx. 0.13 oz), and even having to queue up to purchase. Those who arrive late are told that they cannot exchange.

### Suggestion That the Salaries of Public School Teachers and Staff Should Be Revised; A Proposal by Councilor Gao

[Our Newspaper's Report] Municipal Councilor Gao Shu'an proposed to the Senate that the central government should find ways to remedy the low salaries of public school teachers and staff. His reasoning is as follows: According to Article 19 of the Central Government's regulations on reorganizing finances and strengthening economic control, the standard of treatment for civil and military public school teachers and staff is that those with an original salary of 300 yuan can only get 92 yuan in gold yuan, and those with an original salary of 800 yuan can only get 142 yuan. However, the general price level is one to several times higher than before the war. In this situation, how can public school teachers and staff support themselves? The reason for the previous corruption and inefficiency of civil servants was largely due to the low salaries. Now the low salaries remain the same, and it is impossible to expect them to be clean and honest and to advance in their work. In order to prevent public school teachers and staff from worrying about hunger and cold, and to eliminate accumulated malpractices, the said treatment should be reconsidered and revised.

In addition, Feng Chaoran's famous painting "Seeking Immortality" was generously donated by an anonymous person and entrusted to this newspaper for a public charity sale of 500 gold yuan. All proceeds will be used for scholarships. The painting was made by Feng in the year of Wu Wu (1918), and the brushwork is vigorous. It is a rare masterpiece in the modern painting world. Now it is generously sold for charity by an anonymous person, and his spirit of generosity and philanthropy is even more admirable.

The painting is currently being treasured by the Social Services Department of this newspaper. Collectors and enthusiasts at sea who wish to purchase it can contact the Service Department of this newspaper within five days.

### Public Utilities Review Committee; Reviews Parts of Gas and Telephone; Discussion on Depreciation and Other Issues Is Very Heated

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Public Utilities Review Committee of this city held its fifth meeting at 3:00 pm yesterday in the Municipal Government Conference Room. More than a dozen people attended the meeting, including committee members and representatives of various octagonal business companies, chaired by Mayor Wu. The review yesterday was on the gas part. According to Shanghai Gas Company, the most difficult problem for the company is depreciation. During the war, various equipment and machines were in disrepair for a long time. At least 18,000 pounds of foreign exchange will be needed next year. In addition, dividends have not been paid since the date of 1941. The company's raw material gas has increased sharply, but the gas price is still 5% lower than in 1936. The representative of Wusong Gas Plant reported that the gas at the plant has reached saturation. Depreciation and foreign exchange are also difficult, and the company's economic situation is deteriorating. The committee members then conducted a detailed review of the company's calculation of employee salaries and depreciation base. Shanghai Telephone Company stated that the company's telephone lines urgently need to be replaced, and depreciation costs must be prepared. The meeting decided to ask the company to provide detailed accounts of exchange loss calculations and send them to the Public Utilities Bureau for review and comparison. Committee member Li Zhijie questioned the source of funds for the company's new 10,000 telephone sets. The two sides had a heated discussion, and the meeting adjourned at around 9:00.

### Selling Stocks in Violation of the Exchange Law; District Prosecutor's Office Prosecutes Four Defendants; Three Fugitives in the Same Case Will Be Dealt with Separately After They Are Apprehended

[Our Newspaper's Report] "Xiangshu" giant Xian Lin Legeng, Securities Exchange operator Du Weiping, and Li Guolan, the wife of Ministry of Finance Secretary Tao Qiming, and Yang Shuyuan, the wife of China Petroleum Company Secretary Xu Zhuanghuai, who sold Yongsha, were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office by the police on the 4th for violating the Exchange Law, and were taken into custody by the prosecutor on the same day after the court session began investigation, respectively. Yesterday morning, the prosecutor filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law, and at 3:00 pm, the indictment and all case files were transferred to the District Court. The original text of the indictment is as follows:

### Original Text of the Indictment

"It is found that Du Weiping is the person in charge of Hongxing Securities, and since August 16th of this year, he has been continuously engaged in off-exchange transactions, selling a large number of stocks. On August 16th, he sold 16 million shares of Yong'an Spinning Factory to Lin Legeng, on August 19th, 5 million shares to Yan Xianting, 4 million shares to Dong A'er, and 3 million shares to Zhenchang. He also used the name of Huamei Industrial Trading Company to trade in order to avoid attention. On the same day, Xu Yang Shuyuan and Tao Li Guoguan also sold 2 million shares of Yong'an Spinning Factory stocks in Huamei. All are off-exchange transactions, and Li Boqin, who is at large, presided over the matter, making huge profits. After a secret report from the Municipal Police Bureau, the relevant violations of the Exchange Law were investigated and transferred to the investigator at the beginning.

It is found that the above-mentioned criminal facts have been admitted by the defendant Du Weiping during the interrogation at the Municipal Police Bureau, and the circumstances are credible. The defendant Lin Legeng's confession at this office that the stock transaction only relied on verbal contact without accounts, and the defendants Tao Li Guolan and Xu Yang Shuyuan's confession that the stock was sold to Huamei without formal accounts at the time, only stating the transaction numbers, etc., it can be seen that the defendants did violate the provisions of the Exchange Law and were privately engaged in off-exchange transactions, which has been recognized. The defendant Du Weiting, Lin Legeng is responsible for Article 38, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 2, and Paragraph 3 of the Exchange Law, and the defendants Li Guolan and Yang Shuyuan are responsible for Article 53 of the same law. Apart from the fugitive offenders Yan Xianting, Zan A'er, and Li Boqin, who should be dealt with separately after they are apprehended, a public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law."

[Another Report] After the case was delivered to the District Court, it will be filed by the Criminal Records Section today, and the first hearing will be held within days.

### Vice President Chen and His Wife Arrive in Shanghai, All Circles to Host Tea Party Today to Welcome Them, Meeting with Reporters to Discuss Revitalizing the Moral Re-Armament Movement, Advocating the Practice of Four Standards to Overcome the Crisis

[Our Newspaper] Vice President Chen Lifu and his wife arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 1:10 PM on a Pan American flight. Over a hundred friends, including Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Jiang Jingguo, Xuan Tiewu, Fang Zhi, Hong Lanyou, Wu Kaixian, and Li Ximou, went to Longhua Airport to welcome them. Although Mr. Chen was tired from the journey, he was in good spirits. After disembarking, he accepted flower offerings from Ms. Zhou Lingzhi and Ms. Gao Huizhen and shook hands happily with those who welcomed him. He then went directly to see his elder brother, Lian Guofu, who is ill. Vice President Chen stayed at the Chinese Farmers Bank Guest House yesterday.

It is understood that Mr. Chen will go to Nanjing soon to attend the Legislative Yuan meeting.

Promoting the Ideal of Universal Love and Great Harmony

During the meeting with reporters, Mr. Chen first reported on the achievements of the World Moral Re-Armament Conference. He stated that the representatives of the twenty-four countries participating in the conference unanimously agreed that the threat posed by materialism and totalitarianism to world civilization must be eliminated, and they deeply felt that to meet the need, it was necessary to establish a positive theory to confront them. The central idea of this theory is based on the fact that the biggest shortcomings of materialist totalitarianism are moral decline and the starting point of hatred and hypocrisy. These shortcomings must be remedied from the root, so it is advocated to practice honesty, purity, unselfishness, and love, the four standards, to overcome this crisis, and to start with the self-efforts of each individual, extending to the relationship between families and countries, which is in line with the Chinese ancient saying "cultivate oneself, regulate the family, govern the country, and pacify the world," a political philosophy that advocates breaking religious, racial discrimination, labor-capital conflicts, etc., and promote the ideal of true universal love and great harmony.

Domestic Promotion Still Needs Planning

All parties in the United States attached great importance to the conference. Mr. Hoffman, the executor of the foreign aid bill, sent a telegram to the conference saying that this movement is a parallel part of the spirit of the Marshall Plan. Speaker Martin believed that this movement is an important turning point in history and hopes that it will be promoted jointly by all sectors of society. Currently, this movement has been widely launched around the world. More than 1,500 people have gathered at the training centers in Caux, Switzerland, and Mackinac Island and Ojai, USA. Mr. Chen was invited to give speeches, and the most effective results were in Scandinavia and Western European countries, especially in the American coal mining area. How to promote this movement in China still needs concrete planning.

More Than Seventy Formal Speeches

After the conference, Mr. Chen visited the democratic advanced countries of England, France, and Switzerland to investigate party politics. He said that the national conditions of each country are different, so the application of party politics is also different. There are many that can be used as a reference for the advancement of constitutional government in our country, and he will contribute them to all parties for reference.

During the three months in the United States, Mr. Chen gave no less than seventy formal speeches during his travels in various countries. He worked for more than ten hours a day, which shows the intensity of his life. These speeches were often held at the invitation of various groups and overseas Chinese. Mr. Chen also said that he had reported the domestic situation to overseas Chinese and government officials and people from all walks of life in various countries in detail. The enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese for the motherland was moving.

### Autumn Wind Blows to Ancient Pengcheng

— Our Newspaper Reporter, Sang Jun

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 4th (airmail)] The autumn wind blows to Xuzhou, and the scenery of the ancient battlefield of Jiuli Mountain is even clearer. Looking west from the mountain ridge to the Central Plains, the horizon is endless. Looking east to the Longhai Railway, the smoke and fog are hazy. This magnificent and solemn landscape is precisely where the more than 60,000 refugees in Xuzhou City place their melancholy and memories. The city defense works inside and outside Luozhou City, completed last year at a cost of 40 billion yuan, are still quietly scattered in every corner. The victory in eastern Henan two months ago turned these fortifications into decorations in the hearts of the 450,000 citizens. Now, the mines in Zaozhuang have been destroyed. The Jiawang mines can still produce more than 2,000 tons of coal per day. The currency system has been reformed, but the problem of commodity prices has not been completely resolved. The weight of these things in the hearts of citizens is directly proportional to the progress of bandit suppression. On the street, few people are seen chewing wild pears and hawthorn cakes, but everyone is so greedily smoking "Gem" brand locally made cigarettes, as if there is endless dampness in their chests waiting to be dried.

Three Equalizations Movement

Liu Jingfu took office in Luozhou on June 14. On the 15th, a warning came from the Central Plains that bandits had launched more than 200,000 troops towards the Central Plains, clearly intending to strike first at this "Mr. Nice Guy." But Liu Jingfu is no longer the Liu Jingfu of the previous few years. He has learned to rectify cadres and reuse talent. What the bandits estimated he could not accomplish in a large-scale battle, he finally achieved this time under the condition of "good planning by people": Huang Baitao's corps moved at an accelerated pace, senior officers of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters directed and dispatched for days and nights without sleep or food, veteran Feng Zhi'an stayed behind in Xuzhou, stabilizing the morale of the rear, and he himself took a plane to the front line three times a day to supervise the battle. The victory exchanged for these conditions is clearly not achieved by chance.

Next, the only biggest gain after the victory appeared, which was the increase in the morale of all combat troops. Every comfort group that came to the Central Plains, facing this healthy and vigorous morale, could not help but have bright prospects emerge in their hearts. Of course, Liu Jingfu also knew that this phenomenon was extremely precious. Recently, he launched a "Three Equalizations Movement," in which everyone from the commander-in-chief to the soldiers is treated equally, lives equally, and enjoys entertainment equally. Now the life style in the front is indeed so simple that it is almost lonely. There are no dances or pop songs in the city. In the sky-filled dust, the people are working and the troops are training.

Generals Smiled

Now, the bandits are holding a review meeting on the north bank of the Yellow River. They admit that the Central Plains campaign was their fatal failure, and they have decided to retaliate. The date of retaliation is likely to be in late October, which is the season of high autumn and fat horses. The location of the retaliation may be from Taian south, Xuchang east, the purpose is still to threaten the Huai River and shake the capital. The capital for the retaliation is the dozens of columns now gathered in southwestern Shandong and the border between Henan and Anhui. What is the deployment and countermeasure on the part of the National Army? We raised this question at a gathering, and the generals of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters all laughed. What they meant was: After the victory in the Central Plains, the strength and actions of the bandit army have been understood thoroughly. In response to this strength, the deployment of the National Army will not be slack for a moment. That night, there was a welcome party at the Bandit Suppression Headquarters. The opening was a Beijing-style drum by "Queen" Li Yunyun. She sang a section of "Guohe Dang Cao," and as the sandalwood clappers tapped lightly, she imitated Zhuge Liang's tone and shouted, "Generals, I now order you to resist Cao! The war is no small matter, remember: knowing yourself and your enemy is the best!" Several generals turned back at the same time to look at me, and I smiled understandingly.

Famous Generals Like Clouds

Looking again at Liu Jingfu's Xuzhou Bandit Suppression Headquarters, there are Li Shuzheng, Zhang Yujin, Feng Yi, and on the military and political front, there are Hu Fo and Wu Yizhou. It can be said that victory is assured. On the corps side, there are Feng Zhi'an, Du Yuming, Huang Baitao, and Qiu Qingquan, all famous generals who are in the same boat through thick and thin. These are all conditions sufficient for victory. This time, the Central Plains Comfort Group presented Huang Baitao with a folding fan inscribed with Yu Qian's exhortation poem. Huang looked at it and said with great enthusiasm: In the Central Plains War, his mind and body were exhausted, but the compatriots in the rear have now given him wisdom and inspiration. He will be more determined and brave in the war. Hu Fo often thinks of the battles of the expeditionary force era and feels that doing government affairs is not enough to his liking. Therefore, he vowed to rejoin the army and show his skills. It is truly moving to face their heartfelt enthusiasm. With such generals who are brave enough to advance, plus his own thrifty and pragmatic enthusiasm, Liu Jingfu will never disappoint the expectations of the entire Central Plains people. According to several captured bandit officers, since the battle in the Central Plains, they no longer believe that Liu Jingfu is a "defeated general." They think that it is a boring insult. Two thousand years ago, Liu Yuzhou started his career in Fengpei, and now Liu Jingfu has taken on the important task of "establishing merit" in ancient Pengcheng. When Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng discussed the generals in front of a wine vessel in Xuchang, they would probably add the name of "hero" to this Liu envoy. The season of golden autumn is here, and the rear may be looking forward to the drop in the thermometer, but in Xuzhou, in the Central Plains, the wind and rain are dark, and you will find that such expectations are so boring!

### Tongxiang Tudian Town Excavates the Tomb of Lu Da

[Our Newspaper, Tongxiang, 5th] About three miles southwest of Tudian Town, in this county, there is a tomb called Lu Da's Tomb, which is said to be the burial place of the Ming Dynasty official Lu Qi. The tomb is three to four zhang high, with an area of more than one mu, and is a well-known ancient site in the surrounding area. Unexpectedly, a part of the tomb was suddenly excavated by people the day before yesterday. When it was first excavated, a stone tablet was found, with the words "Completed in twelve years and three months" and other words. Inside was a black coffin, and the body had not yet rotted. It was wearing a Zao Li hat and Ming Dynasty clothes. There were three jade bowls and a perpetual calendar in the coffin, but they crumbled to the touch. There was also a water tank, a stove, and a small hoard of rice in the tomb, which seemed to be still intact. The tomb bricks are about two feet square and four inches thick, with the words "Made in the summer of the eleventh year of Jiajing" engraved on them. Further inside is a stone door, which is unbreakable, indicating that it is indeed a Ming Dynasty relic. After the tomb was excavated, the villagers reported it to the Tudian Police Station, who learned that the excavation was initiated by Kang, a teacher at a certain school in Nanri Township. He hired workers to excavate at a price of three sheng of rice per work meter. It was also learned that the tomb land was donated to the school by the Shen family. The excavation work has now been suspended, and the excavated body has been buried, awaiting disposal by the authorities.

### Tragic Scenes in Changchun: People Eating People

### Corpse Found in Changzhou: Xu Huolin's Chest and Abdomen Dissected, Criminals Sun Yufang and Feng Youfu Escorted to the Headquarters for Investigation

[Our Newspaper, Wujin, 6th] Chen Dingyi, an army captain in the Wujin Work Group of the Second Assault Detachment of the National Defense Ministry, who also went by the alias Gang, convened his subordinates on the 5th to hold a meeting in Buyiqiao Town. Xu Huolin, a 28-year-old intelligence officer in the Third Division of the Maoshan Bandit Suppression Zone of the Capital Garrison Command, from Danyang, was present at the meeting. His nephew, Sun Xiaopang, 17 years old, had recently been recruited by Chen to work. Sun also worked as a pimp for four women, and the head of his family did not want Xu to go to negotiate. However, considering that Chen's work was introduced to him and that Chen was an acquaintance, he went to Buyiqiao in person to negotiate with Chen. After meeting, Chen first treated him warmly and sent Sun Xiaopang back. Then, he had his subordinates Sun Yufang and Feng Youfu handcuff and secretly murder Xu that night, dumping his body at the Huoqiao Dongzhao wharf. Initially, after Xu was handcuffed, ____ saw the situation and immediately reported to the Seventh Brigade of the Police Supervision Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs stationed in Jintan and the Maoshan Bandit Suppression Third Division Command. Deputy Commander Wang Yusheng led the Ning Police Team to Buyiqiao on the 5th to jointly investigate and rescue him with the standing team of the town. However, Chen Cang fled. When Feng Youfu and others were questioned, the above situation was learned. People were immediately dispatched to the river to retrieve the body. As expected, the deceased's head and neck were covered with wounds, his chest and abdomen were dissected, and his lungs and bowels were protruding, making a very tragic sight. The Command immediately took Sun and Feng, along with a number of pieces of evidence found in Chen's house, back for questioning.

### Pocket News

Suzhou [Our Newspaper] Zhao Weiyao, the chief of the Wu County Police Bureau, has recently been ordered to be transferred to the Police Security Office as an inspector. His former position will be temporarily filled by Inspector Wang Zongjing. In addition, County Magistrate Wang Jiefo has again submitted a request to the Provincial Government to resign, but it was rejected again.

Tongxiang [Our Newspaper] Since the Third Transportation Office of the Provincial Highway Bureau opened the Jia-Tong section of public bus service, passengers have found it convenient, and the business situation is also very good. However, the vehicles are old and often break down on the way, and the car windows are not complete. It is hoped that the Highway Bureau will improve them quickly.

Yixing [Our Newspaper] Since the central government announced the currency system reform, banks in various places have been ordered to handle the exchange of gold yuan, but Yixing has remained inactive. It is reported that the Yixing office of the Provincial Agricultural Bank also received an exchange order from the head office a few days ago, but only received 2,000 yuan, equivalent to 6 billion legal currency, which they believed was not enough for exchange and delayed starting. Banks and firms are trying to fish in troubled waters, and a large amount of small-denomination legal currency is flowing out, and the local finance is extremely chaotic. Some businesses are even refusing to accept small-denomination legal currency. Banks and firms have not officially exchanged new currency publicly, and the market attitude is novel and waiting and watching.

### Linxia Ignorant People Plot Restoration, Seven Key Criminals Sentenced to Imprisonment

[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 6th] Ma Yunlin, a Linxia native who claimed to be a descendant of the deposed Qing Dynasty, originally named Aiqing Jue Qipu Cun, was induced by bandit Sang Wenbing and Taoist Chen Guhan to call himself "King of Qing Restoration," appointing officials and conferring titles, plotting a riot, and undermining the national system. The case has been judged by the Lanzhou Special Criminal Court. The main culprit, Ma Yunlin, was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and seven years of deprivation of civil rights. Accomplices He Yinggan, Kong Haizhou, Lu Deli, Shi Guoyou, Shi Youcun, and Zhao Lianghui were each sentenced to four years of imprisonment and four years of deprivation of civil rights. Key criminal Sang Wenbing is at large, and Chen Guhan is deceased, and both have not been apprehended. It is noted that the case was solved in September of last year. After interrogation by the Security Command and the Special Criminal Court, which lasted for years, the "Seal of the King of Qing Restoration," "Seal of the Minister of Beiyang Affairs of the Inner Palace, Loyal Duke," and "Imperial Edict," "Dragon Seal," telescopes, guns, and other items were seized. In his "Imperial Edict" were the words "Loyal Child King, Military Governor of the World's Soldiers and Horses." Ma is 23 years old and his accomplices, the pseudo-monarchs and ministers, are all poor farmers. When he was being escorted back, he said that he was controlled by the evil Taoist. These ignorant people are both pitiful and laughable.

### Conspiracy to Sabotage the New Currency System: Bandits Launch Vicious Offensive

— Special Correspondent, Fan Litian

[This Newspaper, Jinan, 2nd (Airmail)] Since the implementation of the currency reform, initial success has been achieved in besieged Jinan within the past ten days. During this period, although some people in this war zone were misled by the rumors and sabotage of the communist bandits, inevitably harboring doubt and watching, there were also a small number of unscrupulous merchants, such as those in the silver, coal, and scarce goods industries, who either refused to sell under the pretext of having no goods or deliberately raised prices. However, after repeated explanations and strict control by the relevant authorities, the people's confidence in the new currency quickly recovered and transitioned from recovery to firm belief. Therefore, generally speaking, various goods in the market were able to be traded at the fixed prices set on August 19th. The Jinan branch of the Central Bank has exchanged a total of 82.382 taels of gold, 31,092.411 taels of silver, 21,809 silver dollars, and 403.20 US dollars in the past ten days. Comparatively speaking, the amount is not small and symbolizes the initial success of the currency reform.

Rumors Collapse of Their Own Accord

In order to sabotage our new currency system, the most vicious trick of the communist bandits is to spread rumors everywhere, saying that the Gold Yuan is just another name for the large-denomination Legal Tender. However, after Yin Wenjing, Director of the Shandong Provincial Department of Finance, refuted this using various means on various occasions, this rumor collapsed of its own accord. Director Yin said: "The Gold Yuan is fundamentally different from the Legal Tender. The Legal Tender has no reserve, while the Gold Yuan has a full reserve. The Legal Tender has no legally defined maximum issuance limit, while the Gold Yuan clearly stipulates a maximum limit of 2 billion. The Legal Tender has no fixed exchange rate with foreign currencies, while the Gold Yuan clearly stipulates that every four yuan is equal to one US dollar. The issuance of the Legal Tender has never been transparent, while the reserve and issuance of the Gold Yuan have a strict and transparent inspection system. All of this proves that the Gold Yuan is absolutely not a large-denomination Legal Tender. Those who spread such unfounded rumors are either because of their shallow knowledge or have ulterior motives."

Secretly Purchasing Gold and Silver

The second conspiracy of the communist bandits to sabotage the new currency system is to raise gold and silver prices as much as possible and purchase our gold and silver in large quantities. After the implementation of the new currency system, the government fixed the price of gold at 200 Gold Yuan per tael, equivalent to 600 million Legal Tender, and silver dollars at 2 Gold Yuan per coin, equivalent to 6 million Legal Tender. However, in order to sabotage our new currency, the communist bandits deliberately valued gold at 1 billion Legal Tender per tael and silver dollars at 10 million Legal Tender per coin, and they could be exchanged without limit. For the sake of profit, the common people smuggled to communist-controlled areas regardless of everything. The Shandong Provincial Government, in accordance with the central government's regulation allowing each person to freely carry two taels of gold jewelry, naturally found it inconvenient to stop this when the new currency system was implemented. However, as the outflow gradually increased, it recently had to change its approach. Before the supplementary regulations of the central government on "Measures for the Handling of Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Owned by the People" are promulgated, it can only temporarily stipulate that even gold jewelry is not allowed to be carried to communist-controlled areas, but it is only temporarily prohibited in order to comply with central government laws.

The Emergence of the Hua Mao Company

The third conspiracy of the communist bandits to sabotage our new currency system is to increase the prices of goods intended to be transported into the Nationalist-controlled areas as much as possible, thereby depreciating the credibility and value of the Legal Tender and the Gold Yuan. In addition to the existing industrial and commercial bureaus in various places, the communist bandits have recently added a "Hua Mao Company," a specialized agency responsible for selling surplus materials from communist-controlled areas and investigating and purchasing materials lacking in the Nationalist-controlled areas. To this end, the Shandong Provincial Government and the Economic Department of the Second Pacification Zone have specially established a "Centralized Committee for the Transportation and Protection of Export and Import Goods." The quantity of goods that exporters intend to transport, the destination area, and what goods they will exchange in return must all be guaranteed in advance and approved by the Economic Department of the Pacification Zone before a permit is issued. Only after inspection by the Inspection Department will transportation be allowed. The main purpose of this is to achieve "bartering" and "adjusting supply and demand" under conditions of severe material scarcity through strict control.

Urgently Promulgate Supplementary Measures. To ensure the complete success of the currency reform, the first thing that is needed is to stabilize the currency value. To stabilize the currency value, the most important thing is to first achieve price stability. In order to achieve price stability, in principle, it is necessary to do at least the following: (1) eliminate floating capital, (2) increase production, and (3) build people's confidence in the Gold Yuan. Therefore, in order to stabilize the currency value, increasing production, or in other words, increasing materials, is also one of the important conditions. In pacification zones like Jinan, all important materials, such as grain, salt, oil, coal, and cotton, mostly come from communist-controlled areas. Since the new currency system was promulgated and prices were frozen at the fixed prices of August 19th, the source of materials has been shortened day by day, coupled with the control or blockade of the communist bandits, causing many of the few remaining materials in the city to flee. Even with effective control, it will eventually lead to "no business to run" and "no goods in the market" due to the lack of material sources. Therefore, from a purely economic point of view, Jinan, under such a siege, must first open up the military situation. In addition to the four laws originally promulgated with the currency reform, the central government should also promptly promulgate some supplementary measures to adapt to the special environment of the pacification zone. Only in this way can the new currency system be further consolidated, and prices in the pacification zone can maintain a long-term stable situation.

### National Banks and Bureaus Held a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Future Lending Policies: Loan Targets Determined to Focus Especially on Production Enterprises

[This Newspaper] Liu Gongyun, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, convened a meeting of heads of national banks, bureaus, and treasuries at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss future lending policies. The following two points were decided:

(1) In the future, loans should be strictly reviewed in advance to prevent the use of loans for hoarding and other illegal activities, and strict audits will also be conducted afterward. After this principle is determined, detailed measures will be drafted and submitted to the Joint Council of the Four Banks for decision.

(2) The targets of future loans are limited to: 1. Enterprises producing daily necessities, 2. Basic industries, 3. Export industries, 4. Public utility transportation enterprises. In terms of daily necessities industries, the target of loans is production rather than transportation and sales, and the restrictions are extremely strict.

The results of yesterday's meeting will be submitted to the Joint Council of the Four Banks for approval and will be followed when national banks and bureaus resume lending.

### China Textile Shares to be Issued in Ten Days: Sold on Behalf of China Communications, Farmers Bank, and Other Banks

[This Newspaper] Since the China Textile Construction Company decided to reorganize into the China Textile Construction Co., Ltd. starting on the 11th, the new company's shares are expected to be formally launched in about ten days.

The new company's total capital is 800 million yuan, and 30%, or 240 million yuan (equivalent to 2.4 million shares), will be offered to the public.

However, before the stock exchange resumes business, it will be sold on behalf of banks such as China Communications and Farmers Bank.

Also, national enterprise shares for sale, in addition to China Textile, also include Taiwan Sugar, Taiwan Paper, "China Merchants Bureau," and Tianjin Paper Mill. It is heard that the organization work of these units will also be completed, and they will be issued this week. The number of shares is divided into several types, such as one share, five shares, ten shares, fifty shares, and one hundred shares, with each share priced at 100 yuan.

### China Farmers Bank's Spring Silkworm Cocoon Reeling Loan Reaches Over 480,000 Yuan

In the second half of the month, the amount was over 220 yuan in the Shanghai area and 210 yuan in other areas.

### Importers and Exporters Urge Authorities to Quickly Issue Special Foreign Currency Certificates of Deposit

The Municipal Importers and Exporters Association and 16 other trade associations have jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Import Management Committee, the Central Bank, and the Central Trust Bureau, urging them to quickly issue special foreign currency certificates of deposit to the original importers for the price of goods arriving at the port with their own foreign exchange but without import licenses, which the China Trust Bureau had purchased but not yet paid for.

### Errata and Supplementary Items for the Export Goods Price Limit List

[This Newspaper] There were some omissions and errors in the third export goods price limit list announced by the Import Management Committee yesterday. After investigation, the errors that should be corrected are as follows:

Chongqing No. 87 mixed bristle should be changed to Chongqing No. 27 mixed bristle. Tianjin No. 65 mixed bristle should be changed to Tianjin No. 55 mixed bristle. The ordinary export color of male yellow wolfskin should be 2.70 US dollars per piece instead of 2.60 US dollars.

The items that were omitted and should be added are: Feathers: Goose feathers are 48 US cents per pound, duck feathers are 33 US cents per pound, goose down is 1.85 US dollars per pound, and duck down is 1.55 US dollars per pound.

### Raw Tea Production Prices Surge

[This Newspaper] According to tea industry authorities, the price of tea in various production areas in Tunxi, Anhui, has been rising sharply recently. It is also reported that the Xiuning Tea Industry Association has telegraphed related companies and stack shops here for several days, stating that the price of stir-fried green tea and baked green tea in the Tunxi market has surged, reaching over 80 Gold Yuan per dan including remittance fees, but buyers still need it due to the relationship with the goods. However, tea merchants in this city are deeply concerned about this, because it is difficult to increase prices when everything is stable. At the same time, it is difficult to coordinate exports with this reproduced tea, so the industry currently hopes that the prices in the production areas can be reduced slightly so as not to hinder production and sales.

Yesterday's tea market: The entry and exit of domestic tea were mutual, and the situation was stable. As for export varieties, negotiations were not smooth, and only sporadic transactions were made. In terms of prices, they were all hovering and there were no major changes.

### Credit Remains Stable: Banks and Bureaus Have Net Inflows

Yesterday, the trend of credit in this city was still stable. The four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury had a combined net inflow of 1.48 million in the exchange of bills in the money industry, of which the Central Bank had a net inflow of 1.07 million, the Bank of China had a net inflow of 210,000, the Bank of Communications had a net outflow of 380,000, the Farmers Bank had a net outflow of 50,000, the China Trust Bureau had a net inflow of 420,000, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau had a net inflow of 70,000, the Central Cooperative Treasury had a net inflow of 140,000, commercial banks and shops had a net inflow of 1.37 million in large exchanges, a net outflow of 2.87 million in small exchanges, and foreign banks had a combined net inflow of 20,000.

### Central Bank Decides Not to Restore Interbank Term Deposits

Since the exchange of Gold Yuan for foreign currency began, the amount of floating capital in the market has increased sharply. Responsible persons in the money industry all hope that the Central Bank will restore interbank term deposits to reduce the threat of floating capital to the market. It has now been learned from the Central Bank that interbank term deposits have been discontinued and will not be restored. The past implementation was based on the position of sympathizing with the banks and shops, and it was completely different from absorbing floating capital. The current statutory interest rate is a maximum of 2% per month, and floating capital at this low interest rate has no interest. If the interest rate is increased, there is a suspicion of introducing price increases, and the government has other ways to absorb floating capital, so there is really no need to continue term deposits.

### Household Rice Ration Price Unchanged: Rice Market Weak: High-Quality Japonica and Early Indica Rice Are Available

The rice market has turned weak because the household rice price has been decided not to be changed, and people's hearts are very empty. Moreover, the economic control is strict, and the owners are quite willing to sell. High-quality Japonica rice and early Indica rice are available. Rice shops do not have strong appetites because household rice has begun to be sold, so they buy less from the market to get rid of dead stock. Although the prices are still at the limit price, the rice quality has improved and the supply is very smooth. The actual price has dropped by 3-5 cents, and Indica rice has dropped by more than 5 cents. Unpolished Indica rice is transported in bags for 16.5 yuan. Yesterday, a total of 4,731 dan arrived from the North and South markets.

Flour

Declined, the market was weakest at the beginning of the day because the deadline for shipping stack documents was yesterday, and the owners all wanted to sell. Moreover, the economic control was very strict, and all items outside the industry had dropped, resulting in very few households paying. Bingshun flour opened at only 7.05 yuan, and the market closed slightly stronger at 7.13 yuan because the floating goods were exhausted, a decrease of 10 cents. Lao Che flour decreased by 5 cents, and the decrease was less. Hongfeng, Jiancheng, and Xiongpai flour all decreased by 5-10 cents. Bran factories did not open and are still at the limit price.

Miscellaneous Grains

The market has become weak because rice prices have fallen, people's hearts have calmed down, and the supply of owners has suddenly increased. Although the price of soybeans is still at the limit, the supply is already large, and there are transactions in cart beans and soybeans. The appetite of the North Gang for corn has turned sluggish, and the price has fallen by 5 cents. There are not many transactions in tea beans, and broad beans and red beans are all at the original price, and the supply is large. Only the Shantou Gang takes Yuan wheat, and the market is also stable. Over 200 packages of sesame seeds were offered and traded within the limit. Raw peanuts have not been offered because the Guang Gang has not paid, and there have been no transactions.

Cooking Oil

Continued to decline because all grains have fallen and people's hearts are very empty. Moreover, the economic control is very strict, and the owners all intend to sell, so the supply is very large. Datong soybean oil opened at 50 yuan and closed at 49.50 yuan, a decrease of 1.5 yuan. Vegetable oil was 45 yuan, 1 yuan lower. Raw oil is at the limit price, but the market has also turned weak, and the supply of small cart sesame oil is already large. Reclaimed bean cakes have been sold, and the market has become sluggish.

### Plan to Improve Border Education: Border School Arts and Sciences Groups to be Divided into Departments This Semester: New Two-Year Students to be Enrolled Next Year

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The National Border School was established to cultivate border cadres. Border people had requested a change in the system in the first half of the year. The Ministry of Education believes that the level of students and equipment conditions at the Border School do not yet make it possible to change to a university or college. It has been decided that starting after the summer vacation, the original teacher training courses in arts and sciences at the school will be changed to arts and sciences departments. In the fourth academic year, the arts department will be divided into language and literature and history and geography groups, and the science department will be divided into mathematics, physics, chemistry, and natural history groups. Starting from the next academic year, in combination with the quota of students in each group in the fourth grade of the five-year arts and sciences program, new students will be recruited for the two-year arts language, history, and geography groups, and science mathematics, physics, chemistry, and natural history groups. Students in each subject group in the five-year system will be reasonably taught. Both the enrollment of border students and the needs of the border areas can be taken into account, and the school's equipment will not feel difficult. In addition to basic academic programs and specialized subjects, the curriculum for the arts and sciences departments will require education courses and will increase knowledge courses in agriculture, animal husbandry, medicine, and health as electives. The first three years will focus on basic courses, and the last two years will focus on professional training, which will be connected to the two-year system. Starting this year, the Ministry of Education will allocate funds to expand classrooms, dormitories, libraries, laboratories, and clinics in stages, and to enrich books, instruments, and biological specimens to meet the needs of the changed departments.

### Private College and University Presidents' Symposium: Suggestion to Allocate Scholarships So Impoverished Students Can Pay Tuition and Attend Classes On Time

The presidents offered the following suggestions: (1) Scholarships for university students should be divided into three tiers: 60 Gold Yuan, 50 Gold Yuan, and 40 Gold Yuan. (3) It is hoped that after the Unified Review Committee approves a certain number of slots for each school, the required scholarship amount will be allocated to the school, to be managed by the president. After the students receive the scholarship, they will report the expenditures to the committee. If the committee finds this method inconvenient, they request that the 50 billion Legal Tender allocated by the municipal government for scholarships, as well as the scholarship funds already raised, be distributed to the schools for disbursement to the students, so that students can pay tuition and attend classes on time, avoiding delays in their studies.

### Student Work-Study Program Ends Successfully Mid-Month

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Student Relief Committee, organized by the city's YMCA and YWCA, held a student work-study program during the summer vacation, lasting two months from mid-July to mid-September. A large number of students from various schools participated. The work was divided into two types: on-campus and off-campus. On-campus work involved student welfare and labor services such as building school playgrounds. Off-campus work involved being assigned to various social organizations for service. This summer, approximately 500 students from various public and private universities and colleges applied and were approved to participate, with total expenses of approximately 20 billion Legal Tender. After the summer work-study program ends, they will begin to organize the autumn work-study program, but due to insufficient funds, the number of slots may be reduced, and they plan to no longer accept new student applications. Furthermore, Lu Meihui, chairman of the Student Relief Committee, and committee staff members visited the National Shanghai Medical College and Jiaotong University yesterday afternoon to inspect the work-study facilities. A total of sixteen male and female students participating in the work-study program at Shanghai Medical College were wielding hoes in the autumn rain, clearing a corner of barren land, removing weeds and stones, and building roads. Eighty-four students participated in the work-study program at Jiaotong University. The work-study facilities included a self-service cafeteria, laundry service, sewing service, livestock raising, planting, library management, night school, etc. A bowl of "plain noodles" in the self-service cafeteria sells for 180,000 Legal Tender, while laundry and ironing of a shirt costs 220,000 Legal Tender per item, and a suit costs 1.8 million Legal Tender per set, all several times lower than market prices, greatly benefiting impoverished students. The People's Night School has as many as 640 students, all taught by students of the university.

### Ministry of Education Director Guo Flies to Hankou to Handle Issues at Two Institutions

[Our Newspaper Hankou, 6th] Guo Liangyu, Director of the Ministry of Education, flew to Hankou from Nanjing this morning. Guo's visit is to handle the reopening of the Hubei Normal College and the reorganization of Zhonghua University. It is said that he will solicit opinions from all parties and resolve the issues reasonably.

### Henan Refugee Students in Hankou to Be Accommodated in Newly Established School

[Our Newspaper Hankou, 6th] The student-police conflict (see page 2 of the 4th and 5th issues for details) has ended, and the resettlement of Henan refugee students has also entered a concrete solution path. The Pacification Headquarters has joined forces with various parties to establish a Refugee Student Advancement and Employment Guidance Center, dedicated to solving the difficulties of refugee students.

### United States Retains Davis Cup, Doubles Win Over Australia

[United Press, New York, Forest Hills, 5th] The United States has secured its 15th victory in the Davis Cup tennis tournament. American players Talbert and Hueitt defeated the Australian doubles team of Sidwell and Collin Long in the Davis Cup US-Australia challenge match with scores of 8-6, 9-7, 2-6, 7-5, paving the way for the United States to retain the Davis Cup. This doubles match was the third of five matches, with approximately 6,000 spectators. Hueitt and Parker had already won the first and second singles matches on the 4th, so this doubles victory has already determined the ownership of the Davis Cup. The final two singles matches to be held on the 6th are no longer relevant to the outcome of the championship.

[United Press, Washington, 5th] In terms of superstition, the United States' defeat of Australia in the Davis Cup tennis final is a harbinger of peace, as the last two times Australia defeated the United States were in 1914 and 1939, coinciding with the outbreak of World War I and World War II.

### Open Tennis Tournament: Women's Singles Semifinals Not Completed Yesterday, Mixed Doubles to Begin Today

The women's doubles of the Open Tennis Tournament began yesterday afternoon under cloudy skies. Zhang Zhiying and Luo Xiaojin played calmly, winning the first set 7-5. However, Lei Aishen and Mrs. Pu Jianeng tied the score with 6-2 in the second. In the decisive third set, the Zhang-Luo team had a great advantage at 4-1, but then lost four consecutive games. After a score of 5-5, Lei and Pu quickly won two more games to advance. Zhang and Luo's loss was most regrettable.

In the second women's singles semifinal, Taffus played skillfully, but made many unforced errors. Zhu Zhiying played steadily, often winning without much effort. She won the first set 6-3, and the second set was stopped midway due to sudden rain, with Zhu leading 4 games to none. The match will resume tomorrow (Wednesday) at 4:00 PM.

### Public Sports Competitions Must Apply to the Municipal Sports Association: Wheel Cup and Yaqin Cup Procedures Non-Compliant

In order to manage and maintain amateur sports throughout the city and to fulfill its supervisory responsibilities, the Shanghai Sports Association requires that all sports organizations in the city must apply to the Association for permission to hold public sports competitions ten days before the competition is held. It has been found that the recent Wheel Cup and Yaqin Cup mini-football competitions did not apply for permission in advance, which is not in compliance. While it is certainly permissible for various groups to promote sports competitions, the procedures and methods should be carried out in accordance with regulations in order to maintain sports ethics. Furthermore, any team participating in competitions organized by various groups must be approved by the Association in order to maintain the noble purpose of amateur teams. In order to clarify the procedures for holding public sports competitions for sports organizations in the city, the Shanghai Sports Association is reprinting the "Application Guidelines for Shanghai Sports Organizations to Hold Public Sports Competitions" as follows:

[Application Guidelines for Shanghai Sports Organizations to Hold Public Sports Competitions] (1) In order to manage and maintain amateur sports throughout the city and to fulfill its supervisory responsibilities, the Shanghai Sports Association (hereinafter referred to as "the Association") has formulated application forms and application guidelines for sports organizations in the city to hold public sports competitions. (2) Public organizations in the city holding public sports competitions should fill out the application form truthfully and apply to the Association ten days before the competition date, and may only hold the competition after permission has been granted and the application has been filed. (3) Public organizations in the city wishing to raise funds for charity and public welfare through public competitions and selling tickets must obtain the Association's approval in advance before selling tickets publicly. (4) For the sale of tickets for competitions, the printed tickets must be sent to the Association in advance to be stamped to indicate seriousness. (5) The proceeds from the sale of tickets for competitions should, in principle, not deduct expenses. (6) Necessary expense accounts for competitions must be submitted to the Association for review before being published in the newspaper to ensure credibility. (7) Teams requested for competitions shall be contacted by the various organizations themselves. (8) Any team participating in competitions organized by various organizations, whether tickets are sold or not, must be approved by the Association. (9) In addition to arranging the competition venue themselves, the Association will also notify them. (10) These guidelines shall be implemented after being approved by the Standing Council of the Association.

### Scholarship Basketball Tournament Ends: Huili Defeats Chenyou by a Wide Margin, Dagong Defeats Renyu

Yesterday was the final day of the basketball charity tournament organized by the Municipal Education Bureau to benefit impoverished student scholarships. Due to the rain, only about 400 spectators attended, with ticket revenue of 294 Gold Yuan. The total revenue for the three days was 1,932 Gold Yuan. Yesterday's two matches: Huili defeated Chenyou by a large margin of 64 to 41, and Dagong defeated Renyu by a score of 56 to 37.

Chenyou's Luck and Skill Are Poor

Huili and Chenyou took the court at 7:00 PM. After the start of the game, Moses shot first for Chenyou. Huili's Wei Xu returned the shot, followed by Zhang Pu, taking the lead. After 4 points each, Huili's offensive suddenly increased. Fu Haiyun continuously hit shots, as if divinely assisted. Chenyou's luck was extremely poor, and they repeatedly missed shots. Huili's score rose steadily. At the end of the first half, Huili had an absolute advantage with a score of 30 to 12.

After switching sides, Chenyou adjusted its personnel to try to recover lost ground. Chenyou's He Jingui shot two goals on the sidelines, regaining four points. Yongfang and Wei Xu from Huili passed in a series and shot, and Huili's momentum remained high. Chenyou only had the ability to parry. After 44 to 25, Fu Hai and Zhiji charged left and right, unstoppable. Chenyou called a timeout, but it was of no use. Losing too many points made them panic. Finally, Qi Xia and He Zeng showed some improvement, but it was too late to save the overall situation. As a result, Huili defeated Chenyou by a large margin of 64 to 41.

Renyu's Strength: Battle Suffers Setbacks

Next, Dagong and Renyu faced off. At the beginning of the game, Jiazhou fouled, and Cunzhong scored on a free throw, breaking the score. Longtan followed, shooting in the crowd. Guozheng bumped into someone, and Wenlong was injured, stopping the game for half a minute. Wenlong scored once again, making it 10 to 11. Longtan and Wenyi scored back and forth, and Yunke Xinrong and Pengju each gained something, making the score 19 to 12. Dagong adjusted its personnel, with Wenhua replacing Lianke. Taking advantage of Dagong's unstable formation, Renyu regained four points. Cunzhong shot from afar, and Wenhua charged in, making it 28 to 17. Dagong led in the first half.

After the break, the game resumed, and Dagong's offensive did not weaken. After 34 to 20, Renyu's offensive improved. Wenyi Zhong scored repeatedly, and Renyu chased hard. In close combat, there was an atmosphere of revival, 35 to 39, with Dagong only leading by three points. Lianke returned, and the generals showed renewed enthusiasm. Wenhua shot from afar and shot closely, scoring four goals alone. Renyu was unable to look ahead or behind, with many loopholes. In the end, Dagong defeated Renyu with a score of 56 to 37.

### Memories of the War-Torn Capital

— Zhu Lan Ke

Su Dongpo said, "Events are like spring dreams, leaving no trace." The past is like a dream, and old events are like smoke. The past is the past, and memory seems superfluous. However, who is without emotion? I lived in Bianjing for nearly ten years, and naturally, I have an indescribable love for it. In this war-torn world, who would have thought that this aging ancient city would encounter an unprecedented catastrophe in its history! From newspaper reports and letters from friends, I learned that the beautiful old residence outside the South Gate, the magnificent provincial government and post office buildings, the towering Drum Tower and the ancient ruins of the Nengting, and the bustling Xiangguo Temple, which celebrated every festival, have all been reduced to rubble and ruins after this arson. The Tang and Song cultural relics that had survived for over a thousand years have all been destroyed by the ruthless cannon fire. Now, as I recall them, in addition to sadness, it feels like reliving childhood dreams, just like a ruined son boasting to others about the valuable antiques and calligraphy that he has lost. Perhaps others will laugh at me for being a fool dreaming, but as Tao An's Dream Memories says in its preface, "It is good to dream," I want to cherish this quiet, old dream...

In terms of size, the city of Kaifeng is far smaller than the vastness of Nanjing, nor is it as great as Beijing. Compared with large cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou in terms of prosperity and modernization, it is of course relatively small, and it cannot even compare to the most basic Jinan. Not to mention the more Europeanized Qingdao and Harbin. However, Kaifeng does not have the air of a semi-colony like these Europeanized cities, which may not be Kaifeng's misfortune. Living in Kaifeng, one only feels that it is simple and unadorned, with an antique charm, like a small-scale Beijing - even quieter than Beijing. From Zhongshan Avenue all the way to Longting, from West Avenue all the way to East Avenue, a dozen miles across, even during the busiest time of day, when the sidewalks are crowded with people, it still feels quiet and orderly. Rickshaw pullers, sweating profusely, never forget to greet passersby politely with "Excuse me."

The weather in Kaifeng is colder in winter than in the south, but not as bitterly cold as in other parts of North China. Although it is hot in summer, it is very cool at night, without the sultry heat of Nanjing and Hankou at night. The four seasons, spring is especially short, and autumn is especially long. Autumn in Bianliang is an especially lovely time. Every time the autumn sky is clear and the wind is light, riding to the Yuhuangtai in the suburbs to see the maple leaves, or climbing the Iron Pagoda of Longting in the high autumn sky to look out, looking north at the rolling Yellow River, one can appreciate a true Northern autumn, a kind of desolate scene of "Hu Jia interacting, and the sad cries of grazing horses."

What is most worth mentioning is the simplicity of the people of Bianjing. From high-ranking officials and wealthy merchants to peddlers and hawkers, they all have a lovely, ancient atmosphere. For example, when bargaining with rickshaw pullers, every puller always answers with the utmost humility, saying, "Just give whatever you old man/madam think is appropriate." When going to any shop to buy something, whether you buy it or not, the shopkeeper and the staff will always offer tea and let you sit down, and finally bow to 90 degrees to send the customer out the door, which is truly incomparable to the aloof and condescending attitude of employees in large companies in Shanghai. I remember that the errand boys, rickshaw pullers, and old maids hired at home when I was a child were all diligent and loyal, and they never changed for eight or nine years, which is truly incomparable to the "morning Qin and evening Chu" maids in Shanghai families now.

When recalling any place in the past, one can never forget the food. Kaifeng's "Yiyucun" sugar-coated yam, "Wei Chunlou's" braised Yellow River carp, and "Liangyuan's" roasted duck, their delicious flavors are unforgettable to me forever. Other dishes, such as Ma Yuanxing's oily chicken on Gulou Street, and "Du Yichu's" dried shrimp and Chinese cabbage, are especially missed. These places where I often lingered in the past have probably all turned to ashes.

The easiest place in Kaifeng to evoke ancient feelings is Xiangguo Temple. Xiangguo Temple is complex, multi-faceted, very much like Tianqiao in Beijing. From every corner, you can read a fragmented history of Tang and Song society. From the storytelling of drum books and the variety of miscellaneous shows, you can see scene after scene of the tragic dramas of human life. The last time I returned to Bian, I saw that Xiangguo Temple was already dilapidated, Longting had been in disrepair for many years, and the Iron Pagoda had been damaged by Japanese soldiers with artillery fire. Who knew that four years later, Longting would become a battlefield of cannon fire that attracted national attention, and Xiangguo Temple was probably already razed to the ground. Perhaps only the Iron Pagoda still stands unharmed?

The only thing that makes people feel annoyed is the wind and sand on the streets. The wind and sand in Kaifeng seem to be even worse than in Beijing. Whenever going out, when the wind rises, gusts of gray sand will often cover one's head and face. When returning home and undressing, the neck is full of sand. It is common for the ground and the table to be covered with a layer of sand an inch or two thick.

I remember that the "Reminiscences of the Xuanhe Era of the Great Song Dynasty" specifically describes the section in which Emperors Huizong and Qinzong of the Northern Song Dynasty were captured and taken north, which is tragic and moving, and one cannot bear to read it to the end. Upon receiving a letter from a friend, I did not expect that the casualties of the people in Kaifeng in this Central Plains war would be so great that they could not be compared with the fall of Bianjing by the Jin Dynasty in the Northern Song Dynasty. It can be said to be a catastrophic disaster that is absolutely appalling! This aging ancient city is finished. The place where talented people gathered in the past is now a scene of rubble. Perhaps only the hateful wind and sand are still constantly flying all over this broken ancient city. (Xiangguo Temple, Kaifeng)

### Close to Sentence in the Deep Clouds

— Bai Jiao

In Jin Garden, Gao Yao, Little Ji Mountain, who is leisurely for two days with specialized egrets? The mountains and rivers have never bothered the crazy visitors, and the storms of Juqu can still be stubborn.

Tender transport is subtly paired with clear cups, enjoying the lotus breeze in a hectare of ponds. Scholars do not need to be proud of their large brushes, for pearls leap on the leaves when the time is right. (The pond lotus is a famous species of eighteen scholars, and those that have not yet bloomed are like sharp pens piercing the air, numbering in the thousands.)

Looking south from Big Ji, how many points are open in the ten thousand acres of waves? In the midst of the flickering seventy-two peaks, returning sails are like anchors cutting through the clouds.

Greedily hiding guests is also virtuous, and famous chefs are just right for shrimp and fish delicacies. Shi Ran loves to lie with Sanlang, coldly eyeing Rong Hou laughing at the drunken immortals. (Yu Sanlang once said that he had never seen my drunken state, so that night I got very drunk, singing and playing until after midnight, greatly troubling Sanlang. He secretly peeked at my drunken state, and when I went to bed and called out to him, he repeatedly snored. The next day, he used it as a laughing stock.)

The new transmission of the powder book is happy to enlighten the ignorant, how can strange postures and transformations be the same? There are skillful painters in the world, and there is no creation in heaven. Who among the many historians can boast of their brushwork? Only your family is allowed to be called heroic. Jiang Lang is knowledgeable about the spirit, and the golden mirror is beautiful for thousands of years.

### Selling Books

— He Ku

I haven't bought many books this year because book prices are high and income is low. Every time I think about using some of the money I've saved to buy a book I once saw in a bookstore, the money is always diverted to other urgent needs, so I can only leave the hope for next time. And the chance for "next time" is often sacrificed so lightly, so I list buying books as a luxury and don't dare to frolic around in bookstores casually.

Because I can't afford new books, I think of my old books. If I sell some of my old books, can't I exchange them for a few new ones? So I thought of the twelve volumes of "Esquire" magazine that had been gathering dust in the corner of my desk. These twelve volumes of "Esquire" were ordered directly from the United States by the bookstore last winter when the exchange rate was still relatively stable. There were a few twists and turns in being able to preserve them to this day. The address I left at the bookstore was my office address. Every issue of the magazine could always be received around the 16th of each month, without much delay. But after receiving the June issue of "Esquire," the July issue did not arrive for a long time. Instead, the August issue was received on August 17th. I guessed that it was mostly lost, otherwise how could the August issue come and the July issue be so late?

But I still have to try to find it. If I can't find it, I'll have to buy a replacement. I asked the reception at the office to check. Many foreign magazines are sent to another department for reference and research after being received by the reception. I guessed that this magazine might have been mixed into the laboratory. This guess was indeed correct. The result of the inquiry was, as expected, that it was there, and after being opened, read, and borrowed by the staff, it was still lying quietly on the bookshelf because no owner had come to claim it. At first, when I inquired, I was completely thinking of trying to find something that could not be found. Now that I actually found it, so that the magazine for the whole year would not be missing, I was quite happy.

This time, when I decided to sell books, the first thing that came to mind was the whole year's twelve issues of "Esquire." I thought, let's sell them and exchange them for a few new books to read. On the evening when I decided to sell this beloved magazine, I couldn't help but feel a sense of reluctance. I had looked at every cartoon inside, read every short article, and given up on the longer novels that I had prepared to keep and read slowly. This opportunity was clearly lost. And all those countless, unspoken and spoken cartoons, as well as the painted women of style, were all about to be separated from me at this moment, and I couldn't help but feel sad. Not to mention these, just taking the advertisements in "Esquire" magazine as a textbook would be enough for you to appreciate and ponder. All these things were about to be separated from me tomorrow, and there was a great distance between them and the original dusty corner of the desk!

The next day, I decided to sell them. I ran into an old bookstore, and the owner was very welcoming when he heard that it was "Esquire." He asked me what year they were from. I told him it was 1947, twelve complete issues. He said, "Let's see, I'll give you three million altogether," which is one Gold Yuan.

This number made me shiver in the scorching sun of early September. One Gold Yuan! It's not enough to exchange for a new "Esquire," it's not even enough to buy a "Late Post Weekly," let alone a "Modern Library" book!

I could only put the twelve books back down. It's better not to sell them. Can't I review the old and learn the new? But the hope of reading new books has to be postponed again.

### American Preliminary Examination System

— Mao Yi

The American trial procedure has always been slow and protracted. It is common for a case to be delayed for years before a verdict is reached, and some cases have even been delayed for four years before a verdict is reached. In order to reform this drawback, courts in Washington, Boston, Detroit and other places are now using a preliminary examination system. The results of the trial implementation have been very effective, and state courts in various places have also followed suit and established preliminary examination courts.

The preliminary examination system does not infringe on individual rights, but it eliminates most of the red tape, cumbersome procedures, and cunning tricks of professional lawyers. The concept of preliminary examination originated in England in the nineteenth century. In 1929, it was introduced to the American judiciary by two judges of the Circuit Court of Michigan, and it was first implemented in Detroit with good results. Six years later, Boston also established a preliminary examination court, with equally satisfactory results.

Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes of the U.S. Supreme Court became interested in the preliminary examination experiment. In 1938, a committee of the Supreme Court resolved to modernize the procedural rules of all federal courts and authorized federal judges to freely establish preliminary examination courts. The preliminary examination system was then established.

The procedure of each preliminary examination court varies slightly depending on the personality of the judge. Taking the preliminary examination court of the District of Columbia (i.e., Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States) as an example, it is as follows:

Two weeks before the formal trial, the preliminary examination judge first summons the lawyers of both the plaintiff and the defendant. At the hearing, he first listens to the points agreed upon by both parties, and then listens to the points of contention. Then, the judge restates the case and analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of both sides according to his opinion. Finally, there is an on-the-spot mediation, and if a settlement is reached, the case is resolved.

If the judge fails to mediate, he will record a preliminary examination record, which records the main points of the lawyers' statements. Once this preliminary examination record is approved by the lawyers, it becomes the basis for the formal trial. During the formal trial, neither party is allowed to dispute the points that have been agreed upon in the preliminary examination, nor can new arguments be put forward, unless the judge believes that the preliminary examination judge has made a mistake or is unfair. If a lawyer of either party discovers appropriate new evidence, the judge usually allows him to present it.

In this way, the case is much simpler when the formal trial begins, and the verdict does not have to be delayed unnecessarily.

### Don't Worry

— Fei Yu

Worry comes for no reason, and many people often ruin their health by being melancholy. But as long as we can analyze it with a calm and scientific eye, worry really shouldn't exist in this world. Let's look at an analysis of worry from a soldier during wartime.

During World War I, there were two good friends in England, Dick and Yang, who were conscripted for training at the same time. After the training, Dick was transferred to the European continent to fight first. After the farewell, Dick was very optimistic and content with his situation, while Yang was frowning all day long, worrying about the danger of being killed in battle. Dick, knowing this on the front lines, sent him a letter, saying on the surface:

"In your current situation, one of the following things must happen: either you are mobilized or you are not mobilized. If you are not mobilized, you don't need to worry. If you are mobilized, then one of the following things must happen: either you are transferred to the rear or you are transferred to the front. If you are transferred to the rear, you don't need to worry. If you are transferred to the front, then one of the following two things must happen: either you are in a safe zone or you are in a dangerous zone. If you are in a safe zone, you don't need to worry. If you are in a dangerous zone, then one of the following two things must happen: either you are not injured or you are injured. If you are not injured, you don't need to worry. If you are injured, then one of the following two things must happen: either you are slightly injured or you are seriously injured. If you are slightly injured, you don't need to worry. If you are seriously injured, then one of the following two things must happen: either you are cured or you die. If you are cured, you don't need to worry. If you die, then you can't worry!"

This letter was seen by the communication inspector in the army. Because it was written in a very unique way, he copied a copy of it verbatim. The next day, a newspaper published it under the title "Don't Worry". Three or four days later, this letter was translated into various languages, and newspapers and magazines printed it on the front page in large type, and radio stations used it as a broadcast. Thus, a work recognized as the best analysis of psychology was produced in the hands of an unknown soldier.

### ### Incompatible Interests Make It Difficult to Grow Old Together - Four-Year Engagement Planned to Be Terminated - Reader Consultation - Legal Interpretation

Chen Xuefen asks: I was engaged to a certain gentleman four years ago. Recently, I discovered that our personalities are completely incompatible and our interests do not align. Because I had very little contact with the gentleman before and after our engagement, we did not have a deep understanding of each other. Even if we were to force a marriage, it would be difficult to grow old together. Therefore, I plan to terminate the engagement, but I do not know how to handle the formalities. Please instruct me in detail, esteemed lawyer.

[Mr. Tang Mingshi answers] In law, an engagement may not be compelled by force (see Article 975 of the Civil Code), but the termination of an engagement must meet certain conditions (see Article 976 of the same law). If the conditions (also known as causes) listed in Article 976 are not met, and the engagement is violated, damages shall be compensated to the other party. The so-called incompatible personalities and misaligned interests mentioned in your letter do not constitute conditions (or causes) for termination in law. This is because such so-called "incompatibility" and "misalignment" are subjective and have no objective standard to measure them. As for the termination formalities, other than mutual consent, it is to file a lawsuit for termination based on the law. However, marriage involves a certain degree of risk and should not be considered too carefully. The nature of men and women may be different, and sometimes they can complement each other because of inconsistent personalities; and they can learn from each other because of misaligned interests. The value of a husband and wife lies in mutual understanding and love; they should understand, help, and accompany each other for life. Strengths and weaknesses should complement each other, and it is not necessary for everything to be the same. Please think carefully! Do not lose the opportunity to find a partner due to temporary self-awareness.

### Lost and Found

Lost and Found Fountain Pen: I borrowed a fountain pen from a gentleman at the bicycle licensing office in this city the other day. When I finished using it, the gentleman was nowhere to be found, so I could not return it. Please come to Chen Lugen at the Dongfang Auto Shop at the intersection of Beile Road and Ximen Road to collect it after seeing this announcement.

Searching for Weaving Machine Blueprint: I lost a blueprint of a weaving machine on Jiangxi Road on the evening of the 30th of last month. I hope that the finder will return it and I will offer a small reward. Chen Jitai, 297 Huangdu Road.

Requesting Shen Bao: I would like to request one copy each of the Shen Bao from August 23rd and 27th. If anyone is willing to part with them, please send them to Bao Shusen, Public Works Bureau, Hankou Road.
