### More Than a Thousand National Assembly Delegates Jointly Proposed Allowing Signing Delegates to Attend, To Be Submitted to the Assembly for Discussion Today; Presidential Candidate Nomination Signature Forms Distributed to All Units

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The second session of the First National Assembly convened at 9:15 AM on the 7th and passed the following resolutions: (1) To express respect to Chairman Chiang, to offer condolences to the soldiers fighting the communist rebellion, and to extend regards to people in communist-controlled areas and overseas compatriots. (2) "The deadline for submitting proposals will be determined after the rules of procedure are passed." Subsequently, the rules of procedure were discussed. The session adjourned at 12:15 PM. The third session convened at 3:30 PM and passed the organizational regulations for the Representative Qualification Review Committee and the Disciplinary Committee. The fourth session is scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 8th, chaired by Wang Shijie. The fifth session will be held at 3:00 PM, chaired by Xu Chuanlin and Zhang Boling. The National Assembly Rules of Procedure and the Organizational Regulations of the Proposal Review Committee will continue to be discussed during the sessions on the 8th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] Regarding the issue of signing National Assembly delegates attending the assembly, elected delegates have drafted a proposal requesting the assembly to decide to allow them to attend. Over a thousand people, including Cheng Qian, Li Zongren, and He Chengjun, have already signed the proposal, which will be submitted to the assembly for discussion on the 8th. On the morning of the 7th, Yu Bin discussed the matter with delegate Sheng Zizhuang for a long time, seeking a solution. Yu also met with Chen Lifu in the afternoon, so a resolution to this issue is likely to be reached.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The dispute over the attendance of National Assembly delegates is becoming increasingly complex. The issue of signing delegates attending has not yet been resolved, and National Assembly delegates who lost the central nomination are also demanding to attend at the same time as the signing delegates. They claim that they had previously agreed with Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Zhang Lisheng, and others during their withdrawal that if the signing delegates of the withdrawing friendly parties could attend the assembly, the centrally nominated delegates of the withdrawing signing delegates would also attend at the same time. Now that the signing delegates are said to be attending, the centrally nominated delegates are also demanding the fulfillment of the past agreement. They believe that the best way to resolve this matter is for the responsible authorities of the three parties, social elites, and representatives from both the nominating and signing sides to negotiate and increase the number of professional representatives, so that representatives from both sides can attend at the same time.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The presidential candidate nomination signature forms have been prepared by the National Assembly Secretariat and distribution began on the evening of the 7th, with each unit receiving one booklet to be used for signing nominations for candidates.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Zhang Boling recently stated solemnly to reporters that he has no experience or interest in administration, and his energy is declining, so he will not participate in the presidential or vice-presidential election.

### National Assembly Second Session Passes Motion to Pay Respects to Chairman Chiang, Offer Condolences to Soldiers Quelling the Rebellion, People in Communist-Controlled Areas, and Overseas Compatriots

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The second session of the First National Assembly was held at 9:15 AM on the 7th, presided over by the second group of the presidium, chaired by Gu Zhenggang, with 1,800 delegates in attendance. The session adjourned at 12:15 PM. The stage of general discussion of the "Draft Rules of Procedure for the National Assembly" was completed during the session. After being organized by the Secretariat, it will be submitted to the assembly for a vote. After the Assembly was declared open, the Secretariat first reported on (1) reading the minutes of the first session, (2) congratulatory telegrams and letters of absence, and (3) arranging the seating of the representatives in the hall. Subsequently, Secretary-General Hong Lanyou read the presidium's report on the following decisions: (1) The deadline for receiving proposals is set for 12:00 noon on the 10th of this month. (2) Representative Lin Zigui and 24 others, Representative Ding Xuanxiao and 7 others, Representative Li Zhenting and 16 others, Representative Qiao Jiacai and 2 others, and Representative Zhang Zhaolong, Representative Zhao Xuefeng, Representative Chuan Zhengbang, Representative Liu Yanqing, and Representative Zhang Luxian suggested A: Express respect to Chairman Chiang; B: Offer condolences to the soldiers fighting the communist rebellion; C: Extend regards to people in communist-controlled areas; D: Extend regards to overseas compatriots. It was decided to request the Assembly to discuss and hand it over to the Secretariat for handling. The chairman then briefly inquired whether there were any objections to this report. Wang Lunqing, Tu Shaomei, Sun Yi, Yuan Xiluo, and others spoke successively, all believing that the deadline for submitting proposals decided by the presidium was too short. On the one hand, the assembly should give representatives ample time to submit proposals to reflect public opinion, and at the same time, it was believed that the deadline for submitting proposals should not be set before the Rules of Procedure for the Assembly were passed. The chairman then put it to a vote, and the majority passed "the deadline for submitting proposals will be determined after the Rules of Procedure are passed." The deadline originally set by the presidium for noon on the 10th was rejected. At 10:00 AM, the discussion of the Rules of Procedure for the Assembly began, still adopting the method of extensive discussion by chapter, starting from Chapter Four. Ren Dade, Zhang Shude, Lin Zigui, Sun Shengwu, and others spoke in succession, many of whom still raised different opinions on the restrictions on the scope of proposals stipulated in Article 17. In particular, Zhang Shude believed that the order of the assembly should be: One, Report—Government report and reports from representatives of various units; Two, Discussion—Extensive review of the current situation and amendment of the constitution; Three, Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates should publicly express their opinions in the hall; Four, Elections. Lin Zigui believed that the agenda should be stipulated as follows: (1) Policy Report; (2) Amendment of the Constitution; (3) Discussing National Affairs; (4) Elections. Sun Shengwu proposed that a full committee should be formed to discuss various proposals, but the unanimous opinion was opposition to Article 17. At 11:35 AM, the chairman announced the end of speaking and the completion of the discussion of Chapter Four. Subsequently, Chapter Five on Provisional Motions, Chapter Six on Discussion, Chapter Seven on Voting, Chapter Eight on Reconsideration, Chapter Nine on Readings, Chapter Ten on Agenda, Chapter Eleven on Minutes, Chapter Twelve on Discipline, and Chapter Thirteen on Supplementary Provisions were discussed, taking a total of 30 minutes. Because the representatives raised fewer opinions, the discussion was completed quickly. Finally, the Secretary-General reported that the telegrams passed by the Presidium for handling had been drafted. After reading them once, the entire hall unanimously agreed to pass them and announced the adjournment of the meeting.

### Two Organizational Regulations Passed at the Third Session

The third session was held at 3:30 PM on the 7th, chaired by Zhang Fang, with 1,550 delegates in attendance. First, the Secretary-General reported on two decisions of the Presidium: (1) The Rules of Procedure for the Assembly will be discussed in detail and then submitted to the session on the 8th for discussion. (2) The second, third, and fourth cases of the matters for discussion today are proposed to be discussed in advance. Pan Gongzhan, representing the Presidium, explained the process of discussing the Organizational Regulations of the Representative Qualification Review Committee, roughly divided into four points: First, the Representative Qualification Review Committee is based on the provisions of the National Assembly Organization Law. Some people believe that once a representative has obtained a certificate of election, he is a legitimate representative and does not need to be reviewed again. In fact, this is not a matter of who reviews whom, but rather that the Assembly authorizes the Review Committee to review. Second, the review of the certificate of election is only a review to make it more legitimate. Third, the review does not affect the legal qualifications of the representatives. Fourth, the members of the Review Committee are decided by the Presidium to be senior representatives from each unit. If the senior representative has already served on the Presidium, then the next senior representative will serve. After Pan's explanation, the representatives launched a heated debate on the principles of establishment, and the articles of the organizational regulations were passed one by one after a vote. Subsequently, the draft Organizational Regulations of the Disciplinary Committee were passed. In the draft of nine articles of the Organizational Regulations of the Proposal Review Committee, only the second article was discussed before the adjournment was announced. When discussing the Organizational Regulations of the Representative Qualification Review Committee, the speakers were very enthusiastic, all expressing their opinions on whether the committee should be established. Some people believed that since the representatives had already registered and attended the meeting, they had already obtained legal qualifications and should not be reviewed again, and to whom should the review work be entrusted. Gu Zhenggang stood up to explain, encouraging the Assembly to create a spirit of abiding by the law, and said: Please ask the Legislative Yuan to amend the National Assembly Organization Law, once and for all. Those who held opposing views still insisted on their views. After a vote, the principle of establishing a qualification review committee was passed by a majority. After discussing the organizational regulations article by article, they were passed smoothly. Next, the Organizational Regulations of the Disciplinary Committee were discussed. In the full case of the regulations, there were few speakers, only the fifth article, which stipulated the method of punishment, was considered too strict. After several representatives expressed their opinions, they were put to a vote. Pan Gongzhan's proposed opinion was to change the method of punishment to (1) verbal apology, (2) written apology, which was passed, and the rest were passed without objection. Finally, the Organizational Regulations of the Proposal Review Committee were discussed. The representatives raised objections to the number of members and the sub-group portion stipulated in the regulations. Due to the late hour, it was left for discussion on the 8th, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.

(2) The jurisdiction of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters should include Peiping and Tianjin (the original jurisdiction was Hebei, Chahar, Rehe, Shanxi, and Suiyuan). (3) Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi is responsible for training 30 divisions of new troops, actively equipping them, and completing the task within six months.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] According to the National Assembly News Group: Wang Xifu, a National Assembly delegate from Yongchang County, Gansu Province, suddenly suffered a heart attack on the afternoon of April 3 after arriving in Beijing to report and attend the assembly.

### National Assembly Chronicle: "Suffocating Fatigue"

Special Report from This Newspaper (Nanjing, April 7th)

The meeting on the 7th was the opposite of the one on the 6th. The 6th was not long enough, while the 7th felt endless. The third meeting of the National Assembly in the afternoon set a new record as the assembly rejected extending the session. By 6 PM, when the number of attendees in the hall had dwindled to less than 1,300, the response to Chairman Zhang Fang's question, "Can we extend for 20 minutes?" was a chorus of "Adjourn! Adjourn!" Secretary-General Hong Lanyou and Chairman Zhang, yielding to public sentiment, announced the adjournment. However, several reports after the meeting, including one suggestion, explained the reason for this.

One delegate pointed out that the ventilation was poor, and the air in the hall was terrible and insufficient. The secretariat must find a way to improve it and increase the air supply. Many people laughed at "increasing the air supply," but it was just a laugh born of fatigue. The air in the hall was indeed quite foul. With so many people, plus the increasing fatigue, no one paid attention to the signs on the wall that said, "Please go to the lounge to smoke." The atmosphere in the hall was indeed suffocating. Moreover, the slow and circuitous progress of the meeting agenda, except for a few talkative delegates who spoke only for themselves, caused most people to feel psychologically at odds, further exacerbating the suffocating fatigue.

Gu Zhenggang was the chairman of the second meeting on the morning of the 7th. With a clear and loud voice and decisive handling of affairs, he managed to satisfy the speaking desires of over fifty people who offered opinions within the three hours from 9:15 AM to 12:15 PM. The thirteen chapters and sixty-six articles of the rules of procedure were finally criticized in their entirety, awaiting the secretariat to organize and summarize the opinions, and then, after review by the presidium, they could be presented at the next meeting, so that the rules could be voted on and revised article by article to be passed.

After a while, Chairman Gu didn't see a blind delegate standing up to speak. Just as he was about to proceed with voting on the various opinions, Ling Tie'an groped his way to the podium and criticized him for a while. Yuan Xiluo, a representative from Jiangsu, spoke in the local dialect of Baoshan and launched into a lengthy discussion of the scope of the proposals until he was hoarse and tearful. The presidium made a loud noise before the matter was settled. Chairman Gu roared, "Please be quiet, everyone!" Then he proceeded with the vote, passing Delegate He Foqing's opinion that "the deadline for receiving proposals should be determined after the rules are passed."

Continuing the general discussion of the rules, the written opinions that had not been read out on the 6th were read out first. Mixed with some people's oral opinions, the focus remained on criticizing Article 17 of the draft concerning the scope of proposals. Zhu Daobao, a delegate from Anhui, said, "Restricting people's speech is undemocratic. The country is about to fall, and you still won't let people speak? Matters concerning the national economy and the people's livelihood must be discussed here. If the people's suffering is not eliminated, what's the use of electing a president and vice president?" For a time, a flurry of speech drafts flooded the stage, with evenly matched forces advocating for the deletion and modification of Article 17. Qian Tianren, a Zhejiang delegate from the Democratic Socialist Party, also shouted, "Article 17 must be completely eradicated!" Until after the break, Yuan Xingjie, a delegate from Jiangsu, angrily left the meeting as the audience became impatient and noisy, no longer willing to listen to repetitive speeches. At 11:30 AM, Chairman Gu resolutely announced the cessation of speeches on Chapter 4. Subsequent chapters had little discussion, except for the amusing incident where Chairman Gu opened the floor with "Delegates of Chapter 8, please speak" and a Sichuan delegate who opposed punishment, arguing that "Is it okay to spank or slap on the butt? It's simply an insult!" The morning meeting concluded satisfactorily.

When the third meeting began at 3:30 PM in the afternoon, the secretariat's work on compiling the various opinions expressed by the delegates on the rules was not yet complete. The presidium decided to change the agenda and discuss it in the fourth meeting on the 8th, with the agenda attached. The third meeting was to first discuss the organizational regulations of the Delegate Qualification Review Committee, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Proposal Review Committee. The "Mr. Nice Guy" Chairman Zhang Fang, before soliciting the opinions of the audience, first invited Delegate Pan Gongzhan to explain the opinions of the presidium on the Delegate Qualification Review Committee, because this was a common practice in parliaments of various countries and a necessary setup according to the National Assembly Organization Law. Reviewing qualifications was a legal procedure, not a matter of one delegate being able to deny another delegate's qualification. Therefore, the presidium passed it, but whether to establish it would still be decided by the assembly. Zhan Jiewu, a delegate from Jiangxi who had opposed the establishment of the review committee during the discussion of the rules on the 6th, began to oppose it again. For a time, there was much discussion, with everyone saying that it had already been reviewed during registration, so why create trouble again? The provisions of the organization law were unreasonable and should be sent back for revision. Although some delegates pointed out that it would be embarrassing if the Legislative Yuan strictly adhered to the law and refused to amend it.

Zhang Zhiben, a veteran legal scholar and delegate from Hubei, stood up to give everyone a law lesson. He said, "Establishing a qualification review committee is a common practice in parliamentary organizations of various countries. The review is just a formality. You must know that this assembly is the highest organ of the state. Verifying one's own identity is proof that the election office and the National Assembly Preparatory Committee and other administrative organs did not make mistakes. It is a necessary legal order." Gu Zhenggang further explained on behalf of the presidium that the matters decided by the review committee must still be approved by the assembly to be established, and he advised the delegates that "the people's National Assembly must create a law-abiding style, and the Legislative Yuan's amendment to the organization law should be done only once." He finally managed to persuade most of the people who had misunderstood. During the vote, it was passed by a large majority of 1,359 votes that the Qualification Review Committee must still be established, and the organizational regulations were also passed. The Disciplinary Committee was slightly amended and also passed, but immediately encountered the three iron gates of the number of members, candidates, and organization of the Proposal Review Committee, and things got bogged down again. The adjournment time arrived, and the suffocating fatigue left the agenda stuck there.

### Editorial: The Presidential Election and Modesty

The first National Assembly convened under the Constitution is now meeting in the capital. According to the procedures of the assembly, it will soon elect the president and vice president. Once the new president is elected, the Legislative Yuan will be convened for its first meeting, and a candidate for the premier of the Executive Yuan will be nominated for the Legislative Yuan's approval. If the Legislative Yuan has no objections, the new premier can form a fully elected new government, which will give China's political landscape a new look. From then on, whether it is the administrative system at the central and local levels or any policy decisions on domestic and foreign affairs, they will all be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. Therefore, this National Assembly's election of the president is truly the first step for China's politics to embark on democratic constitutionalism. At the same time, because today's actual situation in China is completely different from the political situations in other countries, it is neither like the United States and Britain, which have two equally matched political parties, nor like the Soviet Union, which has only one dictatorial party. Although the Chinese Nationalist Party has ended the period of political tutelage and implemented democratic constitutionalism, it has a great determination to "return power to the people." However, in the first National Assembly convened under the Constitution, it still occupies an absolute majority of seats, which no other political party can match. Therefore, whether the Chinese Nationalist Party will nominate a presidential candidate to the National Assembly? And if it does nominate, who will it decide to be the presidential candidate? This series of questions is not only of concern to the people of the whole country but is also valued by countries around the world.

However, when the Central Executive Committee of the Nationalist Party held a provisional plenary meeting in Beijing on the 4th to discuss this issue, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the party's leader, suddenly announced at the meeting that he did not want to be a presidential candidate and advocated that the Nationalist Party should support non-party members as presidential candidates. This sudden expression was like a bolt from the blue, and the Central Committee members present were all moved by it. Seeing Chairman Chiang's modest demeanor, sincere and firm, it seemed that he had considered it for a long time and made a decision. Thinking again of the current difficulties and hardships of the country, they really did not know what to do for a while and could only resolve to submit this issue to the Central Standing Committee for research and then report to the provisional plenary meeting on the 6th to make a final decision. After much consideration and discussion, the provisional plenary meeting on the 6th finally passed three resolutions: (1) Accept the research report of the Central Standing Committee (still requesting the leader to be the first presidential candidate); (2) In accordance with the leader's instructions, the party will not determine the candidates for president and vice president in this election, and party comrades in the National Assembly may jointly nominate candidates to participate in the election in accordance with the law; (3) For the election of the president and vice president in the next term, the party should convene a national congress three months in advance to determine the party's candidates, and all party comrades should unanimously abide by it.

From these three resolutions, it can be seen that the Nationalist Party has not abandoned the method of political parties nominating candidates for election. The reason why the candidates for president and vice president were not nominated in this election is that there was not enough time to convene a national congress before the National Assembly to decide on the candidates, and because of Chairman Chiang's modesty, he was unwilling to be nominated by the Nationalist Party as a presidential candidate, in order to show his determination to return power to the people. However, the Nationalist Party will still nominate candidates for the second presidential election. We believe that these three resolutions, whether in theory or in fact, are democratic, progressive, and enlightened, and will surely be supported by both inside and outside the party.

However, we want to point out that Chairman Chiang's unwillingness to serve as the Nationalist Party's presidential candidate does not mean that Chairman Chiang is unwilling to be a presidential candidate. According to the provisions of the Presidential Election Law, in addition to nomination by political parties, presidential candidates can also be nominated by joint signatures of National Assembly delegates. When the news that Chairman Chiang was unwilling to be the Nationalist Party's presidential candidate came out, the whole country was shocked and sent telegrams expressing their support. Even the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and non-partisan National Assembly delegates have successively stated that the first president must be Chairman Chiang. Moreover, the movement of National Assembly delegates jointly signing Chairman Chiang as a presidential candidate, initiated by National Assembly delegate Dr. Hu Shi, is underway, and it can be said that there is absolutely no problem in signing the required number of signatures. However, we still want to state our views on this issue in order to reduce the anxiety of the people.

First, considering the current difficulties of the country, in fact, only Chairman Chiang's assumption of the presidency can overcome the national crisis and lay the foundation for democratic constitutionalism. Chairman Chiang is the only supreme leader in our country, not only enjoying high prestige at home but also admired by various countries. We do not need to sing praises for his supreme contributions to the country and the nation. We only need to recall the scene during the Xi'an Incident. Once the news of his escape was released, the whole country rejoiced as if in a frenzy. How could the emotions of national rejoicing be aroused if he were not a leader unanimously supported by the whole country? Now the country has not yet been successfully built, but has been turned into a "situation of many difficulties" due to the rebellion of the Communist bandits. If Chairman Chiang does not take on this difficult task, how can this critical situation be reversed? It can be said that the expectations of the people of the whole country for Chairman Chiang have reached their peak. The National Assembly delegates are representatives of public opinion elected by the people, and they are naturally better able to understand the opinions and wishes of the people. There is no doubt that they will unanimously vote to support Chairman Chiang as the first president.

Second, Chairman Chiang's modesty is sincere and definitely not a show. Moreover, it is quite firm. However, for the past twenty years, every time we have listened to Chairman Chiang's speeches, we have always heard him say "devote myself to the party and the country," not allowing him to consider his personal gains and losses. Looking again at Chairman Chiang's life and behavior, he has always attached great importance to the party's public will and party discipline, and he respects the public opinion of the people. Now that the Nationalist Party Central Executive Committee has repeatedly requested him, and the National Assembly delegates have expressed unanimous support, it can be said that heaven and people are on his side. Chairman Chiang will definitely reconsider his opinions after a long period of consideration and once again show his great revolutionary spirit of "sacrificing himself for the group."

Third, campaigning is a democratic method, and modesty is also a democratic style, which is especially worthy of our advocacy and praise. I remember that after President Roosevelt's last term expired, he was unwilling to violate the "convention" created by the founding father President Washington and also declared that he did not want to be the Democratic Party's presidential candidate. However, at that time, the war was in full swing, and the Democratic Party considered that the danger of the war situation was that only President Roosevelt's third term as president could open up the world's difficulties, so they still supported President Roosevelt as the presidential candidate. Although Roosevelt repeatedly declined and never delivered a campaign speech to the voters, the result of the national vote was that he was unexpectedly elected as the third president and had to reluctantly take on this difficult task, becoming a good story in American political history. We believe that all great politicians have this kind of demeanor and spirit.

In short, we admire Chairman Chiang's modest demeanor and approve of the resolution of the provisional plenary meeting of the Nationalist Party, but we believe that Chairman Chiang can choose not to campaign, but he cannot be modest again. He should accept the public opinion of the National Assembly delegates and the public will of the people of the whole country!

In addition to East India, the products of Fujian, Shandong, Guangdong, Guizhou, and the Northeast in our country are also very famous. The National Resources Commission established an aluminum company in Kaohsiung, Taiwan Province, to refine aluminum products, and the results are satisfactory.

### Jinshan Temple Rushing to Handle Aftermath; Abbot Taicang Issues Grand Vow to Rebuild; Fire Starter Handed Over to Military Police for Investigation

[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 7th] At 8:00 AM this morning, when the reporter revisited the Jiangtian Chan Temple on Jinshan Mountain, which was still smoldering, the abbot of the temple, Taicang, had been ordered to return to handle the aftermath after being questioned. The ten people, including the fire starter and the warehouse manager, who were detained, have been handed over by the Xinheqiao police station to the military police for questioning, but the cause of the fire has not yet been determined. As for whether any monks jumped into the fire and died for the temple when the fire was raging, it seems to be a mystery. The police repeatedly questioned Taicang, who firmly stated that the temple's losses in this fire, in addition to the food, firewood, and other materials in storage, more than 600 volumes of scriptures in the Sutra Depository, and 117 solemn halls and temples such as the Great Buddha Hall, were all reduced to ashes. All of the more than 200 monks in the mountain were not injured or killed. The police, seeing that Taicang's words were conclusive, ordered him to sign a guarantee for filing and await continued investigation after the fire scene was cleared. It is reported that the ancient relics of Jinshan Temple, such as the Zhou Ding, Zhuge Copper Drum, Su Dongpo Jade Belt, and Wen Zhengming's hand-painted Jinshan Mountain scroll, were all spared. Unfortunately, the four ancient cypress trees under the steps of the Great Hall were charred after being burned by the fire. In addition, the Tathagata Buddha, the eighteen Arhats, and the Guanyin Bodhisattva in the Great Hall were all swept away by the ruthless fire and turned into a pile of rubble. Abbot Taicang is quite ambitious to revive Jinshan Chan Temple. It is reported that after the fire scene is cleared, he plans to go to Beijing to appeal to the Zhangjia Living Buddha and other Dharma protectors in Beijing, requesting assistance in rebuilding Jinshan Temple, and hopes to restore the glory of Jinshan, the only Buddhist resort in the southeast, within ten years.

### Wu, Leader of Resident Mission in Japan, Reviews Japanese Reparations Work

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] Wu Niunong, the leader of the reparations and restitution group of our resident mission in Japan, told reporters today that if the Far Eastern Commission continues to delay the handling of the current production of Japanese merchant ships and the plundered precious metals, then Japanese reparations may become a burden to our country rather than a help. So far, the reparations have only been Japanese domestic industrial equipment, and the United States has a tendency to preserve Japanese industrial equipment as much as possible. Central News Agency previously reported that the Chinese government has requested Japan to return gold, platinum, silver and about 4,000 tons of copper-nickel subsidiary coins worth 106.6 million US dollars, but the Far Eastern Commission has not yet taken action on this. Our country urgently needs these precious metals as expenses for establishing factories using reparations machinery. Our country also urgently needs to obtain ships and parts from Japan's current production to accelerate the work of transporting reparations. In addition, our country also needs mining machine parts. Wu emphasized that the Far Eastern Commission must adopt a proactive and realistic policy to speed up the reparations plan, which will promote the economic recovery of countries affected by the war.

### Nichisho Maru Seized for Smuggling; Negotiations Underway in Tokyo

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 7th] The Japanese ship "Nichisho Maru," which arrived in Taiwan on March 15 to transport Taiwan sugar, is still being detained in Kaohsiung. The two batches of 7,000 tons of sugar that the ship was intended to carry have been loaded last month, but it is still unknown when they can be transported back to Japan. The reason why the ship was detained is that a large number of smuggled goods were found on board, resulting in a fine of NT$34,407,000 by our customs, which has not yet been paid. According to reporters, the US consulate here has reported the case to MacArthur Headquarters, and the special commissioner's office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here has also reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing. All matters concerning the handling of the case are currently being negotiated in Tokyo. Our side stated that the fine must be paid before the ship can return to Japan. According to regulations, the sale of 25,000 tons of sugar to Japan was previously required to be transported by Chinese ships, but because it was not approved by MacArthur Headquarters, it was assumed by Japanese ships.

### Rumor of Building a Pagoda in Changshu, Wuxi Ignorant Women are Fooled, "Filial Daughter" Buries Her Old Mother's Life with Three Bowls of Meat Rice

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 6th] A strange rumor has recently spread in the area north of Wuxi, near the border of Changshu and Yushui counties, claiming that building a pagoda in Changshu is detrimental to the feng shui of Wuxi. Anyone over the age of fifty, belonging to the zodiac signs of Rat, Rooster, Dog, and Horse, will inevitably die. This rumor has spread throughout the villages, and ignorant people believe it to be true, seeking solutions to avert the disaster. It is said that if a child belongs to these zodiac signs, the married daughter must cook a bowl of rice and include a piece of meat for each year of age. For example, seventy pieces of meat for seventy years of age, and so on. In addition, two cattail leaf-wrapped eggs and a spinach plant must be placed in the rice and eaten behind the door in secret, without being seen by anyone. The daughter who delivers the rice must also cross three bridges to be effective. This rumor has spread widely in the northern villages, and many "believing women" have sent rice and meat to their mothers, hoping to avoid disaster. In He Xu Lane, south of Zhangjing Bridge in the county, Yan, the wife of He Changsheng, is 73 years old and has three married daughters. Her daughters successively sent meat rice to their mother over the past three days. Unexpectedly, Yan was old and weak, with poor digestion. Eating three bowls of rice and meat at once caused food stagnation and she suddenly suffered from acute gastroenteritis, resulting in death. The authorities believe that this superstitious rumor is extremely harmful and have ordered a crackdown to prevent more innocent souls from being added to the register of ghosts.

### The Circumstances Around Wuhan

— Our Newspaper Central China War Correspondent Bu Mian

[Our Newspaper, Hankou Airmail Dispatch, 5th] Wuhan, historically a strategic location contested by military strategists, is the focal point connecting the Ping-Han and Ao-Han Railways. It is also the only major port on the Yangtze River. From ancient times to the present, it has maintained its glorious position as the largest city in the interior. Today, in the process of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation, it bears even heavier responsibilities.

Fully Prepared and Standing Firm

Last August, the Liu bandits gathered four columns, attempting to cross the Yellow River to establish the "Dabie Mountains base," threatening the Yangtze River. Huangpi was once lost. At that time, outsiders made various speculations, thinking that Wuhan was about to be in trouble. In fact, the military authorities were fully prepared. They calmly gave an ironclad answer to these erroneous speculations, besides laughing them off. Now, the facts have proven that the so-called "Wuhan tension" at that time was just a reflection of the abnormal psychology of those with nervous breakdowns. To this day, Wuhan still stands incomparably heroic.

Scattered Small Groups are No Match for Us

Since the Jiujiang Command thoroughly suppressed the bandits in the Dabie Mountains area for three months, Liu Bocheng's bandit troops' dream of "establishing a base," which included the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 10th, and 11th Columns, has obviously been shattered. The number of casualties has reached about 30,000. The remaining bandits have all fled. Currently, only scattered small groups and bandits who are no match for our forces remain in the area. Recently, the Chang Bureau has dispatched several supervisory teams to the area to supervise the local administrative agencies and strengthen the organization of local defense forces. According to reports from the teams, the work is progressing smoothly, and it is expected that they will be completely eliminated in the short term.

Analysis of the Military Situation North and South of Suizao

North of Suizao, there are only two bandit columns and an independent brigade. Their actual strength is extremely weak. They dare not take the initiative and only adopt guerrilla tactics. Our army controls the area with powerful forces and can initiate operations at any time to annihilate their main force. South of Suizao, there are only small scattered bandits and inexperienced local communists, whose nature is to constantly disrupt public order so that the local area and the people cannot be stable. However, our army has long seen through their tricks and is now searching and suppressing them separately. The bandit troops flee upon hearing the news, but they still cannot escape our army's annihilation net.

In the area south of the Han River, the bandit army has only 500 or 600 people left, which is not a cause for concern. Although bandit troops are still lurking in the Xiangfan Laokou area, they are not the main force. Under the close surveillance of our army, it is difficult for them to act and they may be completely annihilated soon.

Bandit Suppression on the Southern Section of the Pinghan Railway is Exhausted

South of Zhizhou on the Pinghan Line, trains can pass smoothly through all stations along the line, except for the Xinzheng-Xuchang section. The bandit army has lost the "remaining courage" to harass the area. The Liu and Chen bandits attempted to encircle and attack Fuyang but retreated in defeat after being severely attacked by our army. Recently, the Liu bandits gathered the 1st, 2nd, and 13th Columns near Xincai, attempting to launch a large-scale foolish action, originally intending to coordinate with Fuyang. Now, the situation cannot be salvaged, so they may turn west and attack the Queshan area, fleeing back to the southern section of the Pinghan Railway. Our army, having foreseen this, has taken the initiative to launch an offensive since the morning of the 2nd. It is expected that good news will be reported from the area soon.

Military Deployment Ensures Advantages

With the advantageous military deployment around it and the glorious achievements, Wuhan in April is filled with a quiet and peaceful atmosphere. You can't smell gunpowder, and you can't see gray. It is "Wuhan in April" that is envied, praised, and inspired by millions of people. She is like a strong and chaste virgin, no matter how those frivolous young men jump, entice, or disturb her in her territory, she always stands firm and independent, so peaceful and stable!

### Robertson Elaborates on West German Policy; Urges Germans to Break the Iron Curtain; US and Britain Determined to Support German Unification

[Reuters, Dusseldorf, 7th] British Military Governor General Robertson today addressed the Prime Ministers of the British-American merged zones, criticizing the Soviet Union's war screen policy. He said that the primary task of the Germans is to remove the iron curtain descending upon Germany. He said that the destruction of the iron curtain to reunify Germany is the responsibility of the Germans. The United Kingdom and the United States have formulated a new constitution for the Germans in Frankfurt, but only the Germans can rebuild Germany. Referring to the merged zone policy, he said, "The primary goal of the Frankfurt merged zone government is to restore the West German economy so that it can fully fulfill its mission in the European revival, but its ultimate goal is to lay a foundation for Germany to restore unity. The so-called unity is true unity, with an independent, popularly elected representative government. I cannot give other advice, but only ask you to remove the silver screen descending upon Germany, and do your best to remove this iron curtain. Britain and the United States will be your support. East Germany is not short of politicians who talk about unity, but what they are talking about is not true unity, but simply forming a line with the people of the Czech Republic and other Eastern European countries, equally bound and deprived of freedom of thought and action. The people of West Germany will never be deceived by this smokescreen; they have the right to freedom and will maintain this right. However, Germany also includes East Germany, so the primary task of every German is to end the division and enable every German to enjoy the most basic freedom; this is the meaning of true unity. I hope that the Germans will not be shaken by the war of nerves. The regeneration of Germany is in your hands. Make full use of this Council of States. If this side of the iron curtain takes on major responsibilities, the shackles on that side will not be difficult to overcome in time." Robertson continued to discuss the economic situation, saying, "The Marshall Plan has given German industry even more materials. Through this policy, the people of West Germany will step into the international family that breathes free air. The economic nature of Germany is closely linked to the economies of these countries. The essence of the Marshall Plan is to enable countries in need to work together towards the same goal to compensate for the trauma after the war. However, at present, we can only complete our goals in Western Europe, which is truly unfortunate."

### US and Britain to Take Major Measures to Resist Soviet Scheme to Divide Germany

[United Press, Berlin, 7th] The Soviet Union is now taking further action to split Germany, announcing that a communist-led referendum will be held in the Soviet occupation zone in May or June to gauge public opinion on a unified German government.

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 7th] Political observers here believe that General Robertson's speech is a precursor to a major decision on the future government of Germany soon. This reform will include the definite division of land and economy and currency reform. Allied officials also believe that this reform will be announced at the meeting of the Allied Control Council called by General Clay on April 10. Now the Western Allies have begun final preparations to cope with the dissolution of the Allied Control Council and the establishment of the East German government.

### Montgomery Returns to England from Berlin; British and Soviet Military Leaders Meet with Strict Security

[Associated Press, Berlin, 7th] British Chief of Staff Montgomery dined here with Soviet Commander Sokolovsky in Germany last night and flew back to London today. Although officials said that the banquet was of a social nature, the contents of the talks were kept strictly secret, which aroused general speculation that the worsening relationship between the Soviet Union and Western countries may have been discussed.

[Reuters, Berlin, 6th] Sokolovsky, commander-in-chief of the Soviet forces in Germany, dined with British Imperial Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery on the night of the 6th at the residence of British military governor General Robertson. In addition to Robertson presiding in his position as host, Soviet military government Deputy Chief Tratwin also attended. Outside the building, British soldiers and military police were on strict alert. Sokolovsky and Tratwin arrived in the same car, and Soviet troops and plainclothes guards protected them in two cars. At noon, Marshal Montgomery had lunch with U.S. Commander-in-Chief General Clay and French Commander-in-Chief General Koenig. Clay said afterwards that this was purely a social engagement and that the situation in Berlin was not discussed. He also said that it had not yet been decided whether to convene the Allied Control Council on April 10. When Marshal Montgomery's special plane arrived in Berlin, there was no fighter escort. He toured the British zone of Berlin in the afternoon to inspect the troops. At the same time, British Air Minister Henderson is also in Berlin, inspecting the British Air Force's facilities in Germany.

### Aircraft Collision Incident: Soviets Blame British

Joint Committee to Investigate

[United Press Berlin, 7th] The Soviet investigation team declared today: The cause of the collision between a Soviet fighter plane and a British transport plane lies in the British plane violating the flight regulations drafted by the Allied Control Council. According to regulations, Allied aircraft are not allowed to approach within two miles or 2,600 feet above another country's airfield without prior notification. The collision occurred above the Soviet airfield. At the time, the Soviet plane was circling at an altitude of approximately 1,400 feet, preparing to land, when the British plane suddenly appeared from the clouds, dived toward the airfield, revved its engines, and struck the tail of the Soviet plane, causing damage. As a result, the British plane also lost control, caught fire, and was destroyed. In order to thoroughly understand the detailed course of events, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union must form a joint committee to conduct an investigation.

[United Press Berlin, 7th] British military authorities declared: Regarding the aircraft collision incident, the official announcement will not be released until the investigation is complete. Regarding the Soviet suggestion to form a joint investigation committee, it has not yet been decided whether it will only consist of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, or whether it will include the United States. Two Americans were also killed in this incident, so the United States may send an observer to participate.

### Italian Communists Call on General Confederation of Labor for One-Hour Strike; Internal Division Apparent

[United Press Rome, 6th] The communist-led General Confederation of Labor tonight called for a one-hour general strike across the country on April 12 to protest the murder of labor leaders in Sicily. It is reported that 35 labor leaders have been killed in the island in the past two years, all by the Mafia. However, prior to the General Confederation of Labor's vote on the general strike, an internal division was already apparent. Many of the six million members do not belong to the Communist Party or other far-left factions. Catholic labor leader Pastore opposed the strike in the Executive Committee of the General Confederation of Labor, and a minority group also opposed the strike and formally demanded that the General Confederation of Labor reconsider its opposition to the Marshall Plan.

[Associated Press Rome, 6th] The Ministry of the Interior is constantly receiving reports of riots occurring in various places. Prime Minister Gasperi convened the Cabinet on the 7th for the last meeting before the general election to study the domestic security plan. When the Prime Minister gave a speech at a public gathering in Bologna on the evening of the 5th, the sound of paper bag explosions occurred nearby, and the audience was alarmed, but the Prime Minister remained on the platform, asking the audience to remain calm.

### Sweden Decides to Maintain Armed Neutrality

[Reuters Stockholm, 6th] Swedish Foreign Minister Undén stated today: Sweden will maintain armed neutrality in the event of a third world war, although he believes that a third world war is unlikely to occur. He also said that Sweden has traditionally opposed forming alliances.

### Truman Nominates Hoffman to Head European Recovery Program; Economic Aid to China Also to Be Handled by Him

[Associated Press Washington, 6th] President Truman today appointed Paul G. Hoffman, president of Studebaker Corporation, to execute the $5.3 billion European Recovery Program. Hoffman, who had recently accompanied the War Department delegation to Japan for a ten-day inspection, only returned here this morning. While awaiting formal Senate approval of his mission, he will immediately begin the work of preparing the aid organization. Senate Speaker Vandenberg praised this as a "reliable and capable choice." The Foreign Affairs Committee will meet with Hoffman on the 7th, and may approve this appointment at that time. Hoffman's new position also includes the economic portion of the aid-to-China program. The aid-to-China program stipulates that the United States will provide $463 million in aid to the Chinese National Government, but no more than $125 million of that can be used for military purposes, and the military portion of the funds is not under Hoffman's management.

Brief Biography of Hoffman

[Reuters Washington, 6th] Hoffman, 56, does not smoke or drink, and has good relations with members of Congress and the business community, so it is expected that the Senate will quickly approve this appointment. Hoffman is a close friend of Vandenberg and also a member of the Marshall Plan advisory committee led by Commerce Secretary Harriman. He is an enthusiastic supporter of capitalism and the free enterprise system. President Truman often consults with him on foreign trade and international recovery issues. Hoffman is originally from the Midwest and started out as a car salesman before becoming a giant in the American automobile industry. He also has very harmonious relations with labor unions.

### Wisconsin Republicans Nominate Presidential Candidates: Stassen Has the Advantage, MacArthur Second, Dewey Third

[United Press Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 7th] The Wisconsin Republican Party has a total of 27 votes for the presidential nomination convention. Judging from today's primary situation, it seems that Stassen and MacArthur will split the votes. Preliminary results from nearly half of the 3,138 election districts have been announced. Stassen received the most votes with 83,535, and the lowest with 75,895. MacArthur received the most votes with 66,454, and the lowest with 55,115. Dewey received the most votes with 42,015, and the lowest with 39,594.

[United Press Tokyo, 7th] The Japanese and Americans here are paying more attention to the results of the Wisconsin Republican presidential nomination convention delegate election than to the peace treaty. Officers who support MacArthur's presidential campaign felt somewhat upset upon hearing the preliminary report.

### British Budget Presented to the House of Commons: Special Tax on the Wealthy

[Reuters London, 6th] Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps presented the budget for the next fiscal year to the House of Commons today. Heavy taxes were levied on beer, whiskey, liquor, and tobacco. The tax on the most popular football gambling competition in the country has doubled. While taxes on these more luxurious items and entertainment have been increased, the subsidy system has been relaxed on the other hand, allowing 500,000 low-wage workers across the country to be exempt from income tax, and reducing taxes for middle-class taxpayers with annual incomes between £350 and £500. A capital surtax will be levied on the wealthy at home and abroad (excluding foreigners in the United Kingdom) starting January 1, 1949. Cripps explained that this is not a true tax in the traditional sense, but rather a way for the wealthy to assist the country during times of emergency. Cripps reported the budget plan in detail to the crowded House of Commons for two hours and fourteen minutes. The entire chamber listened quietly, with boos only occurring when he mentioned the capital surtax on the wealthy. If Cripps's estimate proves to be correct, the United Kingdom will have a surplus of £778 million by the end of this fiscal year.

### Major Riot in South Korea; U.S. Authorities Blame Communists

[Associated Press Seoul, 7th] The U.S. military authorities reported on the 7th: A sudden disturbance occurred at night on Jeju Island in the sea off the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula. Hundreds of Koreans, some wielding Japanese swords, swarmed to attack ten police stations. Seventeen Koreans were killed, including six policemen, six civilians, two rioters, and three right-wing political figures who were shot before dawn. U.S. authorities said that the riots were instigated by the Communist Party, with the aim of interfering with the May 10 general election organized by the United Nations. Another report said that the U.S. side speculated that a Communist "Goodwill Team" had moved south to the island.

### Ten-Year Mutual Assistance Treaty Signed Between Soviet Union and Finland

Both Sides Mutually Guarantee Territorial Sovereignty and Independence

[Agence France-Presse Helsinki, 6th] The Soviet-Finnish Mutual Assistance Treaty was signed today, including the following eight points: (1) If Finland is attacked by Germany or its allies, it will do its best to defend its territory, and cooperate with the Soviet Union if necessary. (2) Both signatory countries have the right to determine whether a threat of aggression exists. (3) Both signatory countries must strive to maintain peace and must comply with the spirit of the United Nations Charter. (4) The signatory countries shall not invade each other or join alliances or groups against the other. (5) Both sides guarantee to continue to develop economic and cultural relations. (6) Both sides guarantee each other's territorial sovereignty and independence and shall not interfere in each other's internal affairs. (7) This treaty shall comply with the United Nations Charter. (8) This treaty shall be approved by Helsinki within days and shall take effect from that date for a period of ten years. If no declaration of invalidity is made one year before the expiration date, this treaty shall be automatically extended for five years.

[United Press Helsinki, 7th] With the signing of the ten-year mutual assistance treaty between the Soviet Union and Finland in Moscow yesterday, the alliance ring between the Soviet Union and its neighbors from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea has been completed. The treaty is now awaiting approval by the parliaments of both countries. Observers believe that the Finnish parliament will begin discussions next week, while Soviet approval is a matter of course. According to the treaty, if Finland is invaded, the Soviet Union must obtain Finland's consent before sending troops to assist, which is a major concession by the Soviet side. There is no such provision in the treaties that country has signed with Romania or Hungary.

[United Press Helsinki, 6th] Finnish political leaders said tonight: The Soviet-Finnish Mutual Assistance Treaty is the best condition that can be obtained at present. President Paasikivi expressed satisfaction with it. But it is expected that the treaty will prevent Finland from participating in the Marshall Plan for European aid.

### Security Council Passes Motion to Invite Czechoslovakia to Attend Meeting

Application of Outer Mongolia and Others to Be Re-Tabled

[United Press Lake Success, 6th] The Security Council today voted nine to zero to formally invite the Czech government to send a representative here to attend a meeting to report on the country's communist coup. The representatives of the Soviet Union and Ukraine abstained. The Security Council also decided to adjourn until the 12th to await the Czech government's reply.

Also, Ukraine today requested that the Security Council re-discuss the applications for membership from Italy, Finland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Albania, and Outer Mongolia. Observers believe that this is the Soviet Union's response to the proposal by Western countries on the 3rd to re-examine the applications of Italy and Transjordan for membership. The five major powers are scheduled to discuss it tomorrow.

### MacArthur's Headquarters Reports: Japan's Trade Surplus

[United Press Tokyo, 7th] MacArthur's headquarters reported today that Japan's trade is now in surplus. Since the limited opening of foreign trade on September 1st of last year, up to March 31st of this year, foreign merchants have placed a total of 3,567 orders for goods to Japan, worth US$40.043 million, and imported goods worth US$33.013 million in 151 cases, resulting in a surplus of US$7.4 million. Textiles accounted for the largest proportion of exports, while wool accounted for the largest proportion of imports.

[New Asia News Agency Tokyo, 7th] As MacArthur's headquarters has considered the issue of permitting Japanese businessmen to travel abroad, the Japanese trade community is now carrying out two kinds of organizations, so that it can depart immediately once permission to go abroad is announced. The first organization is of an inspection nature, and may be ordered to be a trade inspection team. The team will consist of about ten members. In the future, within the permitted scope (including various Asian countries), it will investigate the types of goods and fashions needed in various places, so as to provide a reference for domestic manufacturers when they return to the country. The second organization is of a sales promotion nature, and may be ordered to be a trade promotion team. The team will carry various samples of commercial goods, go to various places abroad to promote sales, and accept direct orders from merchants from various countries.

### U.S. Decides to Support Japan; Investigation Team Firmly Advocates Reducing Japanese Reparations; Plan to Disperse Japanese Industry to Be Abandoned

[Associated Press Washington, 6th] U.S. Undersecretary of the Army Draper and Paul Hoffman, who was appointed to execute the foreign aid program, said here today that after recently investigating Japan, they believed that the United States should resolutely strive to rebuild Japan's economy to a high level of production. They believe it would be very unwise to demand more reparations from Japan.

Draper said that the delegation agreed with the proposal made in the Strack Report to oppose the removal of any more reparations from Japan other than those obviously for war equipment. Draper also said, "The conclusion reached by the committee is that Japan does not have a large surplus of productivity, and we agree with the general conclusion of the Strack Report." Hoffman also said that the Allied nations "cannot get much value from Japanese raw material reparations." Draper continued, saying that the United States has indeed decided to abandon most of the plans stipulated in Far East Control Council File No. 230. This file stipulates the decentralization of Japanese industry and the elimination of the former Japanese zaibatsu. The investigation team concluded that Japan's food production will never be self-sufficient, and the only solution is to allow Japan to manufacture and export enough industrial products to buy the food it needs. Draper also said, "The only solution to this problem is to export industrial products." In order to exchange goods for the foreign exchange to buy food and raw materials, it is necessary to seek markets. Hoffman continued, "We firmly believe that the United States must begin investing in the restoration of Japan for the sake of world peace and to reduce the burden of relief borne by the United States." He believes that Japan should organize a total of 4 million tons of commercial shipping, but it must increase much more than what it currently has. Japan urgently needs merchant ships to revive its economy. However, this plan will take four to five years to complete.

### International News Conference Subcommittee Passes Our Country's Proposal: Journalists with Lofty Ideals Should Be Rewarded

[Reuters Geneva, 6th] The Technical Committee of the International Conference on Freedom of the Press recently passed China's proposal to reward journalists who uphold the lofty ideals of the United Nations. Zhang Pengchun pointed out that this move will help improve world news. China's suggestion also urged government-established and other journalism schools to teach: (1) the morality and social responsibility of the journalism profession, and to guard against commercialization, sensationalism, or intolerance of different races and religions; (2) objective, accurate, and detailed reporting. Journalism schools should also study in detail the history and culture of other nations in order to accurately interpret the background of international news.

[Associated Press Geneva, 6th] The U.S. representative today requested the conference to condemn the fabrication and fictionalization of news by government or private newspapers. The proposal received the support of seven countries, including China.

### General Chennault on U.S. Policy Toward China

(12) The Uncoordinated Operations in Burma

At the Washington Conference in May 1943, I first learned of the strange lack of coordination between General Stilwell, the British side, and the Chinese side regarding the military strategy for the Burma campaign.

As commander of the U.S. Air Force in China, I flew back to the country from China to present the opinions I could provide to the Joint Chiefs of Staff—it was at this meeting that Stilwell attacked Chairman Chiang, as I have already described in these memoirs.

Chairman Chiang was not present, but the Chinese side at that time made clear its position, fully supporting the Burma campaign, but insisting on one point, that is, if the British did not land in southern Burma, it would be impossible to carry it out. The British agreed that the Burma campaign was risky without the southern landing operation, but strongly argued that they did not have the ability to land. General Stilwell insisted on a limited Sino-American-British offensive, even without the British landing operation.

These views were never coordinated, and the Burma campaign, which was the main factor in the Allied war effort in the China-Burma-India theater, was a forced compromise. As a result, in the absence of a British landing operation in lower Burma, China's participation was coerced.

In April 1944, just one month before the Nu River offensive, the Chinese part of the Burma offensive had already begun from the Indian side, but the theater command decided that because Chairman Chiang "refused to fully fight," the tonnage of goods allocated to Chinese agencies in April would be transferred to the Fourteenth Air Force.

Obviously, this was the final pressure to force the Chinese army to cross the Nu River.

In February 1943, Stilwell put great pressure on Chairman Chiang, advocating for an intensification of the offensive. But at that time, the Ramgarh divisions (Chinese divisions trained in Ramgarh, India) and the troops on the Nu River front were not ready, and only about 2,000 tons of supplies were airlifted over the Hump to support the Nu River troops.

During 1943, when Stilwell first wanted the Nu River troops to fight, their lack of weapons and even clothing was well known, and the situation did not improve much when the real offensive was launched in 1944. That these people were able to cross the Nu River and cross the Gaoligong Mountains during the offensive is a tribute to the courage and perseverance of the ordinary Chinese soldiers—these soldiers wearing straw sandals.

Indeed, Chairman Chiang had promised that the Nu River troops would participate in the upper Burma campaign, but this obligation had to be linked to another promise, which was that the British must coordinate and launch a landing offensive in lower Burma.

Chairman Chiang believed that if a landing operation was not launched in southern Burma to disrupt the Japanese rear and cut off their transportation lines, the Burma campaign would be an uneconomical investment for his own weak forces.

On this point, I believe that Chairman Chiang had sufficient reasons, so I can never accept the accusation that he lacked confidence because he was not very enthusiastic in this regard. In my opinion, the British abandonment of the maritime landing operation already allowed Chairman Chiang to avoid being subject to this three-way constraint.

In the Washington Conference held in May, the Chinese side's theoretical approach was very clear, and it had already been put forward as early as February when Chairman Chiang refused to launch the Nu River offensive based on the situation at that time. I know that at the Cairo Conference in November 1943 and after the Cairo Conference, China still held the same argument, even though Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chairman Chiang had reached a superficial agreement on the Burma strategy.

So my impression is this: that Chairman Chiang never wavered from what I considered to be sound military strategic thinking, until after the final pressure was applied, that is to say, unless the Chinese Expeditionary Force forcibly crossed the Nu River, all supplies to China would be cut off.

Here, it is worthwhile to summarize the military situation in China in 1942-43.

The Chinese government army controlled the interior of China, including the southwest bordering Burma and considerable areas of North China, Central China, and North China, with the exception of the coast and the Yangtze River basin—in the Yangtze River basin, the Japanese army advanced to Yichang above Hankou.

All of China's external supplies were cut off, except for some supplies that were transported from India by air over the mountainous northern Burma occupied by the Japanese army—the so-called Hump.

This situation was almost in a stagnant state, only slightly changed by the influence of three important measures:

(1) The Chinese troops who withdrew from Burma or were airlifted to India began to be trained in Ramgarh. These troops, together with the commando forces in Manir, launched an offensive through upper Burma in October 1943 under Stilwell's command.

(2) In southwestern China, the so-called Y Force was organized, the purpose of which was to train and supply the Chinese Expeditionary Force, which was prepared to coordinate with the offensive in eastern Burma and the British landing operation in lower Burma, forcibly cross the Nu River and penetrate deep into Burma to the west.

(3) In May 1943, the Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting held in Washington changed General Stilwell's proposal, giving priority to the airlift work over the Hump, so as to support the Fourteenth Air Force on a limited and effective basis.

The China-Burma-India theater command concentrated its capabilities on implementing the first two measures, while the third measure was almost always ignored by Stilwell, so the U.S. Air Force personnel in China have been struggling with supply issues.

### Wide Divergence in Labor-Management Opinions: No Outcome on Vehicle Rental Review

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Rickshaw and Tricycle Rental Review Committee held its fourth meeting at the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to review new prices. Huang Changhan, Head of the Welfare Engineering Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs, presided over the discussion based on the data provided by both labor and management. The data provided by the vehicle owners calculated the average cost of the vehicle body parts consumption, resulting in a new daily rental price of approximately ninety thousand yuan for rickshaws, one hundred and eighty thousand yuan for single-person tricycles, and two hundred thousand yuan for double-person tricycles. The labor side's estimate of parts consumption was approximately seventy thousand yuan for double-person tricycles, which is three times less than the figure provided by the vehicle owners. For example, the vehicle owners claimed that the chains used on the vehicle bodies could only be used for three months, while the labor side claimed that they could be used for eight months. Due to the large discrepancy, the Bureau of Social Affairs decided to investigate the average usage period and value of each part before convening another meeting to decide on the rental figures in the near future. The principle of military rental remains unchanged, with adjustments made every three months. If there are drastic price fluctuations, adjustments may be requested at any time.

### The Purpose of Expanding Rationing is Not to Freeze the Index

Group Convener Issues Statement

[Our Newspaper] In order to stabilize the cost of living index, the Bureau of Social Affairs has proposed expanding the rationing of daily necessities, with various factories mutually distributing products. After exchanging opinions at the Rizhao meeting, an eleven-member group was appointed to meet next Monday to study technical issues. According to Gu Bingyuan, Director of the Economic Administration Division of the Bureau of Social Affairs and convener of the group, the purpose of this measure is to stabilize the index, not to freeze it. Factories will supply daily necessities to employees at cost, eliminating the profit-seeking intermediaries of wholesalers and retailers. The price of rationed goods should be at least 20% to 30% cheaper than the retail price on the market. This matter requires cooperation, with industrial raw material factories supplying raw materials to factories that manufacture daily necessities. If necessary, the government plans to allocate raw materials to the factories or provide loans to the factories in order to achieve the ideal of mutual cooperation and large-scale production and sales. The types of rationed goods and the target beneficiaries will be discussed and decided at the meeting next Monday.

### Bureau of Food Considers Rationing Flour to Fried Dough Sticks and Sesame Cake Businesses

The fried dough stick and sesame cake merchants in this city previously elected representatives, Dai Ziquan, etc., to separately submit petitions to the City Council and the Committee for the Distribution of American Relief Supplies, requesting the allocation of flour in order to save their businesses and benefit the livelihood of the poor.

The Ministry of Food is carefully studying whether to resume rationing to all flour-requiring businesses. However, the Fried Dough Stick Association previously mismanaged the rationing, resulting in members extorting additional fees for the rationed flour and fighting for leadership, attracting local gangsters and gathering crowds to fight. The Social Bureau ordered its dissolution. If flour rationing can be resumed in the future, the organization must first be reorganized before rationing can be carried out to prevent disputes.

### Provincial and Municipal Demarcation of Jurisdictions: Bureaus Consult to Survey Boundaries and Take Over; Zhuzhai Township Residents Make New Demands

[Our Newspaper] The demarcation of jurisdictions between this city and Jiangsu Province has been approved by the Executive Yuan, and the City Government has ordered the Bureau of Civil Affairs, the Bureau of Finance, and the Bureau of Land Administration to comply and report. It is now known that the Bureau of Land Administration is scheduled to convene a meeting with the eight bureaus under the City Government this afternoon to discuss procedures for surveying boundaries and taking over. Once a decision is made, the Dachang and Xinzhuang districts can be formally incorporated into this city. Furthermore, the provincial and municipal boundary of Zhuzhai Township was previously approved by the Executive Yuan to be the Panlong River, with the north bank belonging to the province and the south bank belonging to the city. After hearing the news, the residents of Zhuzhai Township recently submitted a joint petition to the Bureau of Land Administration, signed by representatives such as Zhang Ziqi, requesting that the Zhangshen Port Hongjiang be changed to the natural boundary line, incorporating the ten security units on the north bank into the urban area. The petition stated that most of the northern half of Zhuzhai was originally under the jurisdiction of the city, but now it is incorporated into Jiading County, causing greater resentment among the residents. If the province and county insist on taking over forcibly, they will resolutely resist to show their determination. Therefore, they hope that Mayor Wu can forward the petition to the Executive Yuan to argue the case based on reason, so as to prevent the situation from deteriorating. This will be discussed at the City Government's meeting to discuss the surveying of boundaries and takeover procedures today.

Han Langan and others stated in court yesterday that Liao's payments were not made as agreed, and they successively advanced 76 million yuan. The delay was prolonged, and prices continued to rise, so revenue could not cover expenses, and losses were incalculable. They later agreed to film one movie for Liao as compensation, but Liao was still not satisfied. They are willing to repay Liao's advances and add some interest. After questioning, they were all ordered to return and will be interrogated again at a later date. Han wore a peaked cap, a straw-yellow shirt, a yellow tie, and a tweed suit. He is already forty years old this year, but he is still lively as a teenager, with a thin face and a tuft of black hair next to his right ear. He said he is currently filming two films at Huaguang Company, one called "Black Night Murder Case" and the other called "Hero on the Sea." In addition to Han, the cast includes Guan Hongda, Mei Xi, Bai Hong, Sun Min, Zhang Zhizhi, etc. He jokingly said: "It's my first time being sued. I should film this experience."

### Money Supply Loosening, Banks Extending Funds, Prices Rise Across the Board Yesterday

Since the foreign exchange rate rose by as much as 25% the day before yesterday, prices of various commodities in the city have shown signs of movement. Coupled with the fact that national banks have been extending funds in recent days, the city's money supply is becoming loose, and speculators are taking the opportunity to become active. Yesterday, all industries showed across-the-board fluctuations. The black market for gold and banknotes soared, and commodity prices reached unprecedented highs, leaving all citizens in the city feeling extremely threatened.

Yesterday, the city's money supply was level externally but loose internally. Interest rates in the market fell again. In the clearing of bills among banks and money shops, national banks were still extending funds, totaling 64.6 billion. Among them, the Central Bank had a surplus of 51.3 billion, the Bank of China had a deficit of 83.9 billion, the Bank of Communications had a deficit of 5.7 billion, the Farmers Bank had a deficit of 25.1 billion, the Central Trust of China had a deficit of 18.9 billion, the Postal Remittances Bureau had a surplus of 7.9 billion, and the Central Cooperative Treasury had a surplus of 8.8 billion. Foreign banks in the city also reversed their previous surplus phenomenon and had a deficit in yesterday's clearing, totaling 19.1 billion.

The recent extraordinary looseness of the money supply has caused prices to skyrocket again since yesterday. According to financial analysts, the reasons for this round of monetary easing are threefold: (1) Since the stock exchange stopped inter-day trading, the collective lending activities of the banks and money shops that acted as agents have ceased. Some of the floating capital in the stock market has fled and re-entered the commodity market, stimulating price increases. (2) Large sums of money have recently been remitted to Shanghai from Hangzhou, Jiangxi and other places to purchase physical goods. This batch of funds is currently held by merchants and is also a part of the supporting capital. (3) During the National Assembly, the government's daily expenditures are substantial. This affects the capital market and, because Shanghai is adjacent and has more material goods than the capital, much flows into Shanghai. It is predicted that this phenomenon of monetary easing will not stabilize until after the National Assembly concludes.

### Extra-Market Funds Infiltrate: Food Prices Hit New Highs, Flour, Oil, and Miscellaneous Grains Rise Sharply

The rise in rice prices is expanding. The People's Food Allocation Association wants to purchase rice in the market, causing renewed turmoil in the rice market, which had just stabilized. Although the market was under strict surveillance by economic police yesterday, it was not enough to curb the price surge. Cargo owners heard that the price of Xidi rice products continued to rise, and they repeatedly raised prices taking advantage of the residual effects of the previous market increase.

The Nanshi rice market opened sharply higher by 200,000 in the morning. The increased price wasn't sustained, with a slight drop of 50,000, finally settling at a rise of 150,000. White japonica rice traded at 3.75 million, with thin indica rice and early indica rice each rising by 150,000, and shaded white yuan (a type of rice) rising by 100,000.

The price increase was more intense in the Beishi market than in Nanshi. White japonica rice traded at 3.85 million, up 250,000, special japonica rice traded at 3.95 million, and thin indica rice and early indica rice each increased by 200,000, with shaded white yuan seeing the largest increase of 300,000. Total arrivals in the two markets amounted to 6,841 shi (a unit of dry measure).

Wheat flour continued to advance toward new peaks. The influx of extra-market funds further fueled the market, pushing it forward relentlessly, with little prospect of a pullback. Morning opening price for Bingchuan Flour was 1.435 million, rising all the way to 1.47 million, closing at 1.46 million, a rise of 50,000.

Prices of miscellaneous grains showed mixed movements. Soybean oil factories competed for yellow beans, with Hankou painted beans rising from 2.2 million to 2.25 million, an increase of 150,000. Local beans increased by 50,000, mung beans and sesame seeds increased by 100,000.

The rise in edible oil prices continued unabated, with lively trading and a vigorous market. Jilong-branded raw oil traded at 9.4 million, a sharp increase of 570,000. Local factory soybean oil reached a maximum price of 8 million, up 350,000. Chaozhou merchants eagerly bought soybean cakes, with Datong cakes reaching a new high price of 940,000, up 30,000.

### Sugar Prices Resume Upward Trend

Yesterday, the sugar market was bullish due to the rise in foreign exchange and the strengthening of the Taiwan dollar. Actual sales also became more active, and prices gradually rose.

### Stimulated by Outside Forces, All Chinese Stocks Hit Limit Up

Chinese stocks were driven by external stimuli yesterday, and short sellers panicked, leading to intense gains. The after-market is even more bullish. Yong yarn exceeded the limit up, and all spot stocks hit the limit up, fiery and enthusiastic. The morning was initially calm, and inter-day trading was even more sparse, with no transactions. Yong yarn spot stock opened at 1540 yuan, briefly falling to 1525 yuan, then rising to 1610 yuan, and inter-day trading began at the same price. China Silk, Match, Xinyi, and Huaxin successively hit the limit up. Outside the market, commodity prices were bullish, and Hong Kong Electric shrank to 9 jiao and a half.

Over-the-counter unlisted stocks rose by 5% to 10%, with only Zhongxing failing to rally.

Overseas Stocks

The private telegram from Hong Kong reported a significant shrinkage in foreign exchange yesterday. The black market surged, greatly boosting morale. The supply of retail investors was limited, and there were too many buyers. Securities firms and banks were all buying. Jardine Textiles opened at 2.05 million in the morning and closed at a new high price of nearly 2.40 million in the afternoon. The number of chips was limited, making it easy to rise sharply. Compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson rose by 10%, while rubber stocks, Jardine Textiles, Wheelock Marden, Yeguang Paper, Yap Bee, Steel, and Shipping rose by around 20%. Smaller stocks, in particular, were even more outstanding.

### Gold Market

Is There Talk of Restoring Free Trading?

According to authoritative sources in the financial sector, the government will make changes to its control measures on gold and foreign exchange. On the gold side, it will be fully opened for free buying and selling. However, all firms engaged in gold trading must obtain a license from the Financial Management Bureau after review before they can officially operate. If the Bureau discovers that any firm is manipulating the market or raising prices, it can revoke its license. The control measures on foreign exchange will be changed to a linked import and export system, but the system will not be a free linkage system, but rather a limited linkage system. The authorities will still have regulations on the types and quantities of goods that can be imported and the types and quantities of goods that can be exported, to prevent excessive imports of non-essential goods from harming the foundation of domestic industry and commerce. The government is currently planning these two points in detail.

### Domestic Exchange Rate Revised

The domestic exchange rates of the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury will be revised from the 8th as follows: Changsha and Hengyang each at 50 yuan, Lianyungang and Xinpu each at 20 yuan, Anqing at 20 yuan, Wuhu at 15 yuan, Shashi and Yidu each at 120 yuan, Nanchang at 50 yuan, Jingdezhen at 60 yuan, Jiujiang at 50 yuan, Ji'an and Ganzhou each at 70 yuan, Chongqing and Chengdu each at 20 yuan, and Yunnan at 90 yuan.

[Our Report] Some banks in the city have started offering so-called "weekly deposits" since yesterday, with an interest rate of 2 jiao and 1 fen, for a term of seven days and a minimum deposit of 500,000 yuan. According to financial analysts, this new method is a transitional measure after the cancellation of inter-day trading, used to alleviate the difficulties of long positions. Once stock prices rise, this type of method will likely be canceled because the deposit interest is very high, and banks have no profit to be made when handling it.

### Settlement Issues Resolved for Consignment Export Goods

[Our Report] Regarding the issue of overdue foreign exchange settlements for export goods consigned by exporters, the Shanghai Import and Export Industry Association repeatedly requested the Central Bank to settle the payments at the current exchange rate.

Regarding overdue foreign exchange settlements for consigned export goods, this bureau has resolved a solution on March 21st of this year. Starting from April 1st, there will be a one-month period to settle at the current exchange rate. Overdue payments will still be handled according to Circular No. 111. Applications for price reductions or returns should be submitted to this bank for review.

### Buying Momentum Continues: Yarn and Cloth Soar

### Military Service Clarification (II) Written by the Third Section of the Shanghai Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau

(1) Regarding exemption from military service: If a draftee is disabled, deformed, or has a chronic illness that makes him unfit for military service, his parents or he himself may fill out an application for exemption from military service and submit a medical certificate from a local registered hospital or registered qualified physician to the Bao Office to apply for exemption from military service. However, during the review of these applications, it was found that very few were truly disabled or deformed, and most were not chronic illnesses but could be treated. In other words, they could be fit for military service after treatment. Therefore, most of the applications based on this reason were mostly approved with the order "Rotational Conscription and Inspection", telling them to wait until the time of conscription and undergo another inspection. If they are truly ill, they will be rejected; otherwise, they should enlist in the camp according to the law. As for the physical standards of the draftees, they have been disclosed at the meeting of the Physical Examination Committee and will not be repeated here.

(2) Regarding criminal offences: Any draftee who has been sentenced to imprisonment of seven years or more is prohibited from serving in the military. If applying according to Article 20, Paragraph 3, and Article 26, Paragraph 5, a copy or photocopy of the judgment should be submitted as proof.

(3) Regarding going abroad on official business: Any draftee going abroad on official business must submit a passport or an official document approved by the National Government as proof.

(4) Regarding student deferment: Any draftee studying at a high school or above should submit a formal certificate from the school. Many people only submitted a certificate from the school's academic affairs office when applying, but because it was not a formal school certificate, it was rejected and a formal school certificate must be supplemented. Also, high school and university graduates are still subject to conscription, but those who have passed military training and obtained a military training certificate are considered to have the qualifications of reserve cadres and may not be conscripted. In January of this year, the Ministry of National Defense issued a telegram stating: "High school and university graduates are not subject to general conscription." However, the implementation of conscription this year is based on the regulations of the 36th year of the Republic of China, and laws cannot be retroactive. Therefore, this regulation must be implemented from the next year. High school and university graduates of the 36th year of the Republic of China will still be subject to general conscription unless there are other reasons.

### Clavijo's Embassy to Tamerlane

By Tian Chunyin

Translated by Yang Dixian Shanghai First Edition, August 1947

The direct translation of the book's name should be "A Journey from Cadiz to Samarkand during the Time of Timur." The original author was Ruy Gonzales de Clavijo, the envoy of the Kingdom of Castile (one of the predecessors of Spain) to Timur, chronicling his journey. The translator believes that "records of Central Asian history and geography are few in number. Researchers in both the East and West are troubled by the lack of materials, so Clavijo's book can be said to be an important record that followed in the footsteps of Marco Polo's travels." This assessment is accurate. In the "Historical Materials" chapter of Lucien Bouvat's *The Mongol Empire* (Paris, 1927), translated by Feng Chengjun, Clavijo is also mentioned as having "left behind a rather interesting narrative that has been published and translated many times." Bouvat's book is of particular value for the 15th century, and Clavijo's book is certainly valuable as a reference. At that time, there were many emissaries from China's Ming Dynasty to the Western Regions. Feng Chengjun once examined the names of these envoys. According to the *History of the Ming Dynasty: Western Regions*, they included Chuan An, Guo Ji, Chen Dewen, Chen Cheng, Ba Tai, Li Da, Bai A'er Xintai, Lu An, Li Luo, Jin Halanbo, Guo Jing, Li Gui, Hai Rong, Ma Quan, Ma Yun, and Zhan Sheng. It seems that only Chen Cheng wrote a travelogue. Chen Cheng repeatedly served as an envoy to the Western Regions. His *Records of the Western Regions Foreign Countries* is also a valuable material for studying the history and geography of the Timurid era. Yang Dixian believes that Clavijo's book is better than Chen Cheng's because the former is not averse to being detailed, striving for comprehensiveness, and recording his own experiences truthfully. As a result, we can use this book to glimpse the outline of Central Asian society at that time.

Although Timur's establishment of a kingdom in the Western Regions did not match the vastness of Genghis Khan's empire or its longevity, it did encompass the territory of Central Asia, lasting for six generations and more than ten rulers. His empire existed only during the reigns of Timur and Shah Rukh. After Shah Rukh, there were only separatist lords; there was no longer a monarch capable of ruling the entire country. Therefore, the capital of the empire was sometimes in Samarkand and sometimes in Herat. However, almost all of the separatist figures were descendants of Timur. Although there was no longer a prosperous empire, it was still the Timurid Dynasty. Although the empire collapsed not long after, as Timur had predicted, and was finally destroyed in 1502, the new country built by its descendants in India continued until 1857. Bouvat said, "Although the establishment of a nation by Timur and his successor-monarchs did not last, their influence was quite the opposite. We can say that the fate of Asia and Europe was partly caused by Timur's work. The influence of the brilliant Timurid culture on Islamic culture can only be compared with the culture of the prosperous era of the Caliph (Islamic leader). Therefore, Timur was the most shocking of the Mongol monarchs to the Europeans. His defeat of Bayezid, the Sultan of Constantinople, was tantamount to prolonging the remnant fortunes of the Eastern Roman Empire, and its contribution was even greater than that of the European crusades. Therefore, Clavijo was ordered to cross the Turkish forces, which were regarded as "Sache," to ally with Timur to the east. After Timur galloped through Central Asia, Persia, India, the Caucasus, Mesopotamia, and Asia Minor, he also wanted to invade China to the east. At that time, China was ruled by the ambitious Emperor Chengzu of the Ming Dynasty. If the two heroes had met, the face of the history of Sino-Western exchanges would have changed greatly. Although Clavijo's book has no system for all of Timur's literary and martial governance, it is indeed a detailed side view, which not only allows us to clearly understand the faces and moods of the characters who stirred up the situation in Central Asia, but also can fill the missing pages of our country's Western Xinjiang history. Furthermore, Clavijo's book records the historical and geographical situation of the Eastern Roman Empire, Italian city-states, and Asia Minor around the 15th century, which can also be used as a reference for Western history, enabling readers to outline and compare, and there are indeed many first-class historical materials.

The translator's source is the Turkish translation by O'mer Riza Dogtul, which he then re-translated, along with the summary attached by the Turkish translator. The main text consists of seventeen chapters. Chapters 12-15 describe his observations of Samarkand and Timur. Although the book is prone to inaccuracies, most of it is reliable and can be called the highest in terms of historical value. The Turkish translator also based his translation on Turkish records, detailing important personal and place names. Yang Dixian, considering that there are many textual researchers related to Central Asian history and geography in Chinese records, selected the important ones and attached them after each chapter. There is a lot of information about China, which is most helpful to domestic readers. However, it is a pity that a route map is missing. The translation is clear. Although there are occasional differences in literary language, it is simple and pleasing, wanting to preserve the original intention of the text.

There are few records of Central Asian history and figures, and the destruction is even more severe. During the late Qing Dynasty, the Chinese people had a great interest in studying the geography of the Northwest, but the achievements cannot be said to be many. If you don't know many languages and translate the first-rate works of Central Asia and the West, you won't achieve success. In recent times, Zhang Xinglang, Feng Chengjun, Xiang Da and others have made great achievements in this area. Yang's translation is indeed worthy of praise, because it helps to fill the gaps in Chinese and foreign history in many places. The author of this article knows nothing about Turkish and Clavijo's original Spanish text, so I dare not praise the translation itself. However, I hope to briefly introduce the importance and value of his work to the Chinese people in an interesting way.

### The Origin of Art

— Wen Zhaotong

By E. Grosse, translated by Chen Yi, published by Datong Bookstore

This world-renowned book already has two Chinese translations. Chen Yi's translation in 1933, titled "The Origin of Art," was published by Datong, while Cai Muhui's translation in 1937, titled "The Origin of Art," was published by Commercial Press. From the perspective of fluency and readability, Chen's translation is superior to Cai's, so I will introduce Chen's version.

Historically, studies of the origin of art have often neglected concrete facts and basic artistic phenomena, instead delving into metaphysical depths, flaunting stale philosophical terms and abstract artistic concepts, resulting in confusion and failing to achieve thorough understanding or new inspiration. In other words, this is due to neglecting the inevitable conclusion of scientific inquiry.

Dr. Ernst Grosse, born in 1862, was a German art historian who studied ancient art in Japan. Using an anthropological and cultural historical perspective, he studied primitive art. This book, "The Origin of Art," completed in 1912, is a great work. He pioneered the use of scientific research methods, and his meticulous examination, extensive citations, and penetrating judgments have ensured his lasting fame.

Grosse states in the preface to this book: "This book is the first attempt—to explore a realm that no one has ever ventured into before." This is indeed not a boast. Let's look at its content.

Chapter 1, "The Purpose of Art Science," explains art history, art philosophy, and art science, and discusses the problems, scope, and value of art science.

Chapter 2, "The Method of Art Science," presents Dubos, Helder, Taine, Hennepuin, Guyan, and the method of comparative ethnology, research on primitive art forms, and the collection and interpretation of materials.

Chapter 3, "Primitive Peoples," describes the conditions of primitive peoples, tribal production, culture, family, religion, and their current situation.

Chapter 4, "Art," explains the nature of artistic activity, belonging to social phenomena and social mechanisms.

Chapter 5, "Body Decoration," this chapter is the richest part of the book, presenting various body decorations of many existing primitive peoples, such as body painting, scarification, tattooing, ear and nose ornaments, hair, head, neck, waist, and limb decorations, and clothing decorations, and concludes that the meanings of these decorations are threefold: (1) to attract the opposite sex, (2) to intimidate opponents, and (3) to mark social status.

Chapter 6, "Decoration," collects handicrafts, utensils, and other objects used among primitive peoples, and studies the patterns, changes, and meanings of their decorations.

Chapter 7, "Descriptive Art," describes the cave paintings of primitive people, carvings on stone walls, and paintings on bark. It also explains the relationship with primitive production and compares it with children's painting art.

Chapter 8, "Dance," explains that primitive dance is practiced, simulated, religious, and its social significance.

Chapter 9, "Poetry," in addition to analyzing the lyrical and narrative nature of primitive poetry, it also discusses primitive novels, stories, dramas, myths, etc., which can be said to be a very extensive study of the literature of primitive peoples.

Chapter 10, "Music," describes primitive vocal and instrumental music, and explains its relationship with poetry and dance.

Chapter 11, "Conclusion," in this chapter, it first reviews the research that has been done, and points out that art is a means of survival competition, and further explains the social and personal significance of art.

This book has at least two advantages:

(1) It attempts to synthesize art philosophy and art history to establish a system of art science or art sociology. In addition to psychological and sociological methods, it also indicates the method of comparative anthropology, which is worthy of praise.

(2) It discovers the social function of art as a means of survival competition from the most rudimentary works of art, and denies Taine's and others' arguments that the roots of art formation are climate, ethnicity, environment, era, as well as intellectual and moral customs, which is the second point worthy of praise.

Although Grosse's research object is only the art of existing primitive peoples, not the art of the Stone Age; the incorrectness of the order of occurrence of various arts, and ignoring: "Labor, music and poetry were initially fused into a trinity, and the basic element was labor... the origin of poetry is in the labor process." (See K. Bucher's "Labor and Rhythm"), as well as some contradictions and debatable points, it still has its unique value.

### Literary Chinese Function Words

— Zhu Dashou

(By Lü Shuxiang, one of the "Opening Light Youth" books)

Function words in classical Chinese are the biggest headache for students, and ordinary Chinese teachers just vaguely gloss over them when explaining them. As a result, students are even more unable to understand the usage and meaning of empty words—even if students look up the dictionary themselves, they cannot get a detailed and clear explanation, such as "其, 指物詞，助洞." or "與, 及也，給予也." How can such annotations enable students to understand?

This book, "Literary Chinese Function Words," focuses on the commonly used words and common usages in ordinary literary Chinese.

The entire book has twelve chapters, discussing about twenty words, which seems insufficient, but in the current situation of lacking similar publications, it can already solve the difficulties students encounter with function words. The explanation of each word is indeed very detailed, with each word divided into several categories, explaining its usage and meaning separately. At the end of each chapter, there are exercises, which can give students a deeper memory and the opportunity to develop themselves.

Finally, I hope the author can continue to write, insert it in the next reprint, or publish a sequel separately to supplement it.

### On Soviet Literature

— Weiming

Although the title is "On Soviet Literature," it clearly reflects the spiritual inclination of English literature.

The preface of the book contains an introductory text, which says: "The Literary Group of the Soviet Cultural Association once proposed that British and Soviet countries should exchange opinions on literary issues in writing through questions and answers. After the Soviet writers sent their proposals to England, writers in London and other cities in England had extensive discussions. After answering these questions, the British writers also raised many questions to their Soviet friends. These questions were discussed several times by the Literary Group of the Soviet Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and the answers were sent to England. What is published here is the majority of the Soviet writers' replies."

This book, although not a systematic discussion, is very broad in scope because it takes the form of questions and answers. It ranges from the travel experiences of a writer to the characteristics and spirit of Soviet literature. Therefore, this booklet can indeed leave a very deep impression on people about Soviet literature. Now, I will briefly describe it.

, is about the publication of works, sales statistics, the living conditions of writers and their social status, and the distribution of libraries. The next is about the training of young writers, the characteristics of Soviet literature, and the impact of cultural exchange between the two countries. Finally, it is about answering many specific questions. Because everything is done in a relatively free way, many questions are quite interesting to ask. Such as: "Can detective novels exist in the Soviet Union?" "Does the Soviet Union have laws on defamation?" etc.

At the same time, because these questions are raised, and everything is done in a relatively free way, this book gives us more understanding in the way the questions are asked—understanding the spiritual state of British writers today. For example, here, they raise many questions:

"Is there 'pure' literature in the Soviet Union? That is, novels that set the background of the work before the First World War without involving modern turmoil? For example, works by François Mauriac in France, Walder and Trammell in English literature? Is there 'art for art's sake' that does not contain social education meaning?"

"I often feel that there is a striking blood relationship between the temperament of classical Greece and the temperament of Russia; such as Euripides and Turgenev, and the orators of ancient Athens and Stalin. Is this just a coincidence? Or is it a legacy of classical Greece passed down through Byzantium (the old site of Constantinople)?"

"Which modern Soviet writer do you think has a satirical genius comparable to Zoshchenko?"

"Do you think contemporary Soviet novels are mainly about mass psychology? Or do they focus more on portraying individual characters?"

"Is there any contemporary Soviet writer whose 'mission' is equivalent to Dostoevsky—such as the spirit of 'mutual love' expressed in the two characters of Father Zosima and Prince Myshkin?"

And from all these questions, such as their high evaluation of Zoshchenko, and that kind of history and perspective, we clearly recognize that English literature today is wandering in a dark situation and constantly declining.

I really like this form of question and answer, especially the free use of this form. Therefore, everything is brought up without any concealment. The good results created by mutual frankness are predictable and appreciable.

It is a pity that this is only a part of the questions and answers, and the answers of the British writers to the Soviet writers' questions have not been translated. But what do these count for? What is placed before us is the usefulness and interest of this book.

### Guidance for Algebra Exercises

— Mang

(Compiled and translated by: Xue Dejiong, Publisher: New Asia Bookstore, Price: 2.80 yuan.)

This book is written based on the book by Japanese author Yoshizo Fujimori. There is an introduction before the book, which instructs the method of learning algebra, and specifically explains the advantages and disadvantages of the two learning methods. These two methods are the systematic learning method and the mixed learning method, and the author advocates adopting the systematic learning method, because the mixed learning method is time-consuming and laborious, and not as convenient as the systematic learning method. And the correctness and speed of calculation are what the author believes must be paid attention to. Therefore, the introduction will be of great help to learners, and readers of this book should not omit it.

The whole book is divided into two volumes; the upper volume is divided into two parts, and the lower volume is divided into five parts. The first part discusses the deformation of expressions; the second part discusses equations; the third part discusses simple inequalities; the fourth part discusses the application of equations; the fifth part discusses series; the sixth part is logarithms; the seventh part is the calculation of six numbers.

Looking at the whole book, we can get its advantages as follows:

1.  There are no troublesome and profound theories, and research is only done on methods. This is the biggest advantage of this book, and it can also be said to be the difference between this book and other books. General textbooks have more theories and fewer practical problems. The so-called practical problems are the methods of solving problems. This book is all about introducing many methods of solving problems, so that people will not be at a loss after learning. Many methods in this book are not found in other books. Many difficult problems simply have no methods to solve in ordinary books, but this book introduces clever methods, which easily solve them.

2.  Printing is top-notch, which is an advantage of this book. This book is printed on white newspaper, so there is no feeling of blurring, and it also increases the value of this book!

3.  This book can be used as a preparation book for promotions or exams, because this book is all about methods of solving problems, which are systematically introduced to you, so that you will not be at a loss when doing problems. Moreover, the most enjoyable thing about doing math problems is getting them right the first time, and the most painful thing is getting them wrong or not having a method to solve them. Therefore, after reading this book, you can arouse your interest, and you can get endless fun when doing problems. I advise every young student to read this book to lay a solid foundation for your mathematics. This book is even more suitable for self-learners.

### Review of "Martine"

— Ruofei

A Sketch of Rural Love

I have rarely read the plays of Er, but this time I happened to read his early work "Martine" (translated by Lin Ke), and I was deeply impressed. Perhaps there is no other reason, just because the author expresses the truth of life—no, he simply extracts fragments of life directly, delves into the core of life, and after dissecting it, he reproduces it on paper one by one. He depicts love, but even more he writes out the human touch. In the small five scenes, he reveals the secrets of a girl's soul, tempers and grinds it, the whole play is filled with a bleak atmosphere, in a situation where one has to recall but cannot bear to look back, anyone will taste this strong tea-like human touch.

The story is very simple, directly writing about the little girl who suffers from love, which is "a simple experience of a tiny soul". The five scenes write out the atmosphere in five different environments.

As the translator said, "The whole play does not have any amazing strokes from beginning to end. However, the purity of the texture, the rigor of the composition, and the pastoral elegance and desolation are still very rare in contemporary works."

No climax, no foreshadowing, and no tortuous desolation, it is also a depiction of rural love. A story that can happen in any village, characters that can exist in any village. The most realistic opening, the most bleak ending.

What convinces me is that Bairna used a few strokes to express the taste of love in the entire human world.

Speaking of Martine. Martine, a simple village girl, has a simple and kind heart. Before Julien arrived in Gangshan Village, Martine was satisfied with everything around him—the scenery of Gangshan Village, his family, and the people in his family, and even Alfred, who had been pursuing him. But due to the encounter under the apple tree, plus Julien's teasing, this girl's heart was shaken, as if someone had removed the heavy obstacles in her eyes, she valued herself more, and only valued Julien more. —She then had her dreams.

Her dream is beautiful, night after night, day after day, she has her fantasies and desires. Maybe she is not wrong, a girl cannot be responsible for herself, the one who should be responsible should be Julien.

He teased her, lifted her up, but turned his back and called her "wild grass and flowers".

Maybe, he is not wrong either, in the face of "emotion", they are both captives. Without saying who won or who surrendered, just look at the scene in the last act where the author secretly set up a meeting for the two, Julien's injury, Martine's crying, everything is explained.

Poor Martine, poor Julien, plus a poor Sanne, formed this scene of love dispute. The happy one is still Alfred, he does not know the inside story, and is at a loss.

I thought of a poem by Blake, and I thought of Hakuson Kuriyagawa's "Philosophy of Love".

To put it more realistically, Martine and Julien together are not a good match. Letting Julien have a little bit of Romantic memories is a pleasure in life, and letting Martine have such a fantasy that can never be achieved is a pain in life.

To put it more realistically, the encounter under the apple tree ruined Martine, but it also enlightened Martine. She could have spent her whole life in a daze, but now she has great pain—this is tragedy, Martine's tragedy.

The philosopher said: "Let your understanding of love destroy you, and willingly and joyfully bleed." Martine! Maybe her great pain contains great joy.
