### US Aid Construction Fund Allocation: Responsible Parties Confer in Shanghai; Yu Hung-chun, Lockwood, Stillman, and Others Arrive in Shanghai; Part of Proceeds from Sale of Goods Frozen

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Yu Hung-chun, Lockwood, Shen Hsi-jui, and other responsible figures for the implementation of US aid, flew to Shanghai by China National Aviation Corporation plane at 2:30 PM on the 14th. Yen Chia-kan, US Aid Liaison Commissioner, also left for Shanghai by night train on the 14th. Meetings of various US aid groups will be held in Shanghai within days. The amount of the US aid construction fund will be determined after Stillman returns to Shanghai. It is rumored that it may increase from 60 million US dollars to 70 million US dollars, and including the 10 million US dollars for industrial allocation, it may reach 80 million US dollars.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Regarding the issue of how to use the funds after the sale of US aid materials, the Chinese and American sides are still in discussion. Part of the funds will be frozen. Article 5, Paragraph 5, Item A of the Sino-US Bilateral Agreement already has provisions for this. What remains to be discussed is the amount to be frozen and the amount to be used for other purposes. Currently, neither the Chinese nor American sides have proposed any plans for their use.

[Our Dispatch] Stillman, head of the US Technical Cooperation Mission, arrived in Shanghai by Pan American flight at 1:00 PM yesterday. Those who went to the airport to welcome him included Hsu Pang-yu, director of the Technical Department of the US Aid Utilization Council, and many staff members of the Economic Cooperation Administration. Mr. Stillman wore a dark blue suit, looked energetic, and refused to disclose the exact amount and allocation of the US aid construction fund. However, he stated that he would hold several meetings soon to discuss the matter with the Chinese side.

[Our Dispatch] The handling of the proceeds from the sale of US aid materials is clearly stipulated in the Sino-US Bilateral Agreement, which states that they should be deposited in a "special account of the Chinese government" in the Central Bank. The future use of these funds is also specified as being for the stability of finance and currency value. Rumors that the US Aid Council would entrust other national banks to assist in collecting the funds and then transfer them to the Central Bank on the fourth day are actually a continuation of the transitional measures agreed upon by the former China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Now, the Council has officially decided, in accordance with the Bilateral Agreement, that the proceeds from the allocation and sale will also be directly collected and deposited by the Central Bank. As for whether to entrust other national banks and bureaus to collect the proceeds from the future sale of other large-scale US aid materials, the Central Bank is also carefully considering this.

### Rural Reconstruction Plan to be Submitted to a Five-Person Joint Committee for Discussion and Decision; Chiang Meng-lin Discusses Working Principles

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Chiang Meng-lin, the newly appointed chairman of the China Rural Reconstruction Joint Committee of the US Aid Utilization Council, told reporters on the 14th that concrete plans for using US aid to reconstruct China's rural areas will be discussed and decided in a meeting after the two American committee members arrive in China. Yen Yang-chu has already drafted a proposal, which will soon be submitted to the five-person committee for final decision. It is hoped that various tasks will be launched quickly after the plan is finalized. Mr. Chiang stated that, in his personal opinion, "starting from a small area" is the only principle that can allow limited funds to exert their full effect. In other words, general tasks such as sanitation, education, cooperation, and increased production can be started in fixed areas and then expanded. As for specialized tasks such as water conservancy and pest control, they can be carried out nationwide without being limited to specific areas. Mr. Chiang stated, after recounting his long-term experience in contacting rural areas, that ignorance, poverty, and disease are the three major problems of Chinese farmers. Education can eliminate ignorance, sanitation can eliminate disease, and eliminating poverty is not easy. However, we will start with revitalizing rural handicrafts and restoring the rural economy to eliminate poverty. Reforming the land system is important, but this can only be done with the full and comprehensive implementation of the government. Mr. Chiang indicated that the working staff of the committee must have the spirit of hard work and service, so local talent will be the main focus. He said: If significant results are achieved in the rural reconstruction plan after one year, the direction of our future efforts will be clear.

### Our Ships Returning from Japan: Allied Headquarters Refuses to Supply Fuel

[Central News Agency, Tokyo Dispatch, 13th] Allied Headquarters has refused the request of the Overseas Transport Bureau, submitted through our country's delegation in Japan, for the supply of oil and provisions to our ships currently sailing between China and Japan when they return to China. Recently, the Bureau requested a monthly supply of 10,000 tons of oil, a large quantity of coal, and other provisions for our ships. The payment for these supplies would be settled by the Central Trust Bureau. The Foreign Trade Section of Allied Headquarters replied that the insufficient production of coal to meet Japan's needs has prevented the relaxation of restrictions on coal reserves, which can only be used for emergencies. Moreover, each allocation of coal must be paid for in cash. Allied Headquarters further pointed out that the supply of oil and provisions requested by the Overseas Transport Bureau is not handled by the Japanese government but is managed by the US Eighth Army.

### The President Visited Hanpo Kou Yesterday; Received Ambassador Badger and Others at Noon

[Our Newspaper, Kuling Dispatch, 14th] The President did not go out in the morning of the 14th. Chen Pu-lei went to visit him around 10:00 AM and they walked together in the garden of the official residence for a long time. Ambassador and Mrs. Badger, Consultant Fu Ching-po, and others, accompanied by Secretary Yu Chien-wen, walked around the main street around 10:00 AM. At 12:00 PM, they went to the official residence to pay their respects to the President. The President and his wife personally received them and had lunch together. Mr. and Mrs. Badger expressed their admiration for the scenery of this summer resort, as it was their first time visiting Kuling.

[Our Newspaper, Kuling Dispatch, 14th] The President visited Hanpo in the evening of the 14th and looked out for about half an hour before returning. The President and his wife originally planned to invite Ambassador Stuart, Mr. and Mrs. Badger, and others for a picnic at Hanpo in the evening of the 14th to enjoy the spectacular moonrise. Around 7:00 PM, the President and his wife left the official residence together. The President went ahead, while the Madam invited Ambassador and Mrs. Badger and others. However, a sudden rain shower occurred, and the Madam and Ambassador and others stopped going because of the rain. The President went ahead despite the rain and looked out at Hanpo alone for half an hour before returning. The President arrived at Hanpo at 7:00 PM, got out of the sedan chair outside the archway, and walked forward on foot. The President was in excellent spirits and looked cheerful. He was wearing a yellow military uniform, yellow leather shoes, and a gray soft hat, and was wearing glasses. As he climbed the steps, there were more than a dozen male and female tourists picnicking in the pavilion. Reporters also rushed there despite the rain. When the President saw the large number of tourists, he smiled and asked, "Where are you from?" They replied that they were students from the Nanchang Chung Cheng Medical College and reporters. The President asked, "Where are you now?" The students replied, "We are at the Lushan Hospital." The President also asked how many patients there were in the Lushan Hospital and what diseases they had. The students answered one by one. At that time, the President was in high spirits and said, "Come, come, let's take a picture together." So he took a photo with everyone. The President continued to walk to the farthest small pavilion and looked out at the scenery of Poyang Lake. Hanpo is the main road to Xingzi County, facing Poyang Lake, and its steepness seems to swallow Poyang Lake. The terrain is magnificent and the view is wide open. The President likes this place the most and always comes to visit whenever he climbs Kuling. At that time, the rain had cleared and the sun was setting, casting a rosy glow on the lake, creating a beautiful and magical scene. Unfortunately, it was still early and the new moon had not yet risen. The President lingered for a long time and still walked back. The tourists had not left yet. The President said, "Aren't you going back yet?" The students replied, "We are waiting to see the moonrise." The President nodded and smiled and said, "You can go back now." Then he slowly got into the sedan chair and returned directly to the official residence, where he still had dinner with Ambassador Badger and others.

### The Ministry of Finance Rectifies Financial Institutions; Two Banks' and Firms' Licenses Revoked; A Comprehensive Inspection is Being Carefully Planned

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The Ministry of Finance has resolved to earnestly implement the rectification of financial institutions.

Following the closure of the Hankou branch of the China Industrial and Mining Bank due to illegal engagement in commerce, the licenses of the Xi'an branch of the Overseas Chinese Industrial Bank and the Beiping Changxing Silver Firm have recently been revoked by the Ministry of Finance.

### Third Anniversary of Japan's Surrender

What day is today? Today is the third anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender and the day Japan formally accepted the Potsdam Declaration. Taking August 15, 1945 as the boundary line, the most tragic World War II in human history began to declare its end. People in every corner of the world rekindled new hope in joy and encouragement, expecting that the cruel war tragedy would never be repeated and that the hope for lasting peace could be achieved. This hope is naturally particularly fervent among the Chinese people who have suffered aggression and persecution. Even in Japan, apart from a few remnants of military cliques and zaibatsu, more than 90 percent of the Japanese people are certainly pursuing bright hopes and praying that Japan can achieve true peace, democracy and happiness from now on.

Japan's fourteen consecutive years of war of aggression, starting with the September 18th Incident in the Northeast, predetermined her fate of failure. Therefore, it is said that Japan's defeat was not accidental but inevitable. In July 1943, after setbacks in military operations on both the Eastern and Western fronts, Japan requested Germany to make peace with the Soviet Union, and she indicated to the Soviet Union that she would consider withdrawing from the Far East war and requested mediation with the United States and China. After Germany's defeat and unconditional surrender, Japan constantly made peace overtures to the Soviet Union. It was not until August 4, 1945, when the United States dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, and August 8, when the Soviet Union formally declared war on Japan, that Japan ceased its peace overtures and prepared for a last-ditch struggle. On August 10, the U.S. atomic bomb attacked Nagasaki again, and unprecedented chaos occurred in Tokyo. The Japanese government and the Supreme Command recognized that the end of the war had arrived, and announced to the whole world at 8:30 p.m. that day: "Japan has decided to accept the Potsdam Declaration." Subsequently, Japan entrusted the Swiss government to forward the instrument of surrender to China and the United States respectively, and the Swedish government to forward it to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. On the afternoon of the 11th, U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes, on behalf of the four governments, sent a reply to the Swiss Embassy in the United States to be forwarded to Japan, stipulating the surrender plan in the reply. At noon on the 14th, the Emperor of Japan convened the last Imperial Conference in the palace. Emperor Showa made the final decision in tears, fully accepting the Potsdam Declaration and Byrnes' surrender plan, only requesting to retain the issue of the Emperor of Japan. At noon on the 15th, Showa broadcast the imperial rescript of surrender to the Japanese military and civilians. From that moment on, soldiers laid down their swords, factories stopped work, and preparations were made for the signing of the surrender terms and the arrival of the Allied occupation forces.

The Allied forces entered and occupied Japan on August 28; the signing of Japan's instrument of surrender took place on September 2. After the Allied forces entered and occupied Japan, General MacArthur served as the commander and represented the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission, supervising the implementation of the control of Japan. The fundamental principles of the Allied control of Japan are based on the Potsdam Declaration, which can be summarized into six points: (1) to eradicate militaristic ideology and build a new order in Japan; (2) to dissolve and demobilize the armed forces; (3) to punish war criminals; (4) to establish basic human rights and restore freedom of speech, thought and religion; (5) to maintain the minimum standard of living; (6) to thoroughly democratize politics. The Allied occupation control shall last until the above-mentioned objectives are achieved. According to the Potsdam Declaration, it was a message to Japan issued with the consent of the United States, China and the United Kingdom. The spirit of the Potsdam Declaration is sacred and great; the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration are absolutely correct. The provisions of the Potsdam Declaration regarding Japan took effect de facto and de jure from August 15, 1945. At least before the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration should be unchangeable.

However, in the past three years, have the sacred provisions of the Potsdam Declaration been thoroughly implemented? Has the militaristic ideology of Japan been completely eradicated? Have the Japanese people truly gained democracy and freedom? Has Japan's war system been completely eliminated? In a word, Japan in the three years since its surrender has not truly realized the sacred provisions of the Potsdam Declaration in terms of politics, economy, culture, and society, and some facts show that there is even a significant distance from the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration. Looking at the Yoshida, Katayama, and Ashida cabinets under the new constitution, they have not created democracy for the Japanese people since they came to power. Is this not an irony of the new constitution? The dissolution of the zaibatsu has indeed been implemented, but equity has never been reorganized, and are the Japanese zaibatsu not still "remotely controlling 80 percent of the industrial, commercial and financial circles" in fact? The agricultural land system has undergone several reforms, but apart from the expansion of land ownership by landlords and owner-farmers, not even one tenant farmer has been able to purchase land. Taking the "Five-Year Economic Reconstruction Plan" as an example, its stipulated industrial and mining output far exceeds the level of 1930-34, but its stipulated national living standard is below this base year, which is obviously not for alleviating the suffering of the Japanese people's lives. In short, the measures to control Japan in the past three years, as well as the Japanese government's implementation of the surrender terms, have resulted in the opposite of efficiency. Facts show that Japan is re-embarking on the road to recovery. This road to recovery is not the recovery of the life and culture demanded by the Japanese people, but the gradual recovery of Japanese militarism. What a great threat this is to China and the world!

August 15 is one of the days in human history worth commemorating. On this day, we look at the difficulties of the times and feel a lot of emotion. In the past three years, apart from the fact that Korea, which was previously annexed by Japan, has finally been able to formally establish an independent national government today, and Taiwan, which was ceded by Japan, has returned to its Chinese motherland, we really cannot see how much substantial change has taken place within Japan. But we still believe in the famous saying of the late U.S. President Roosevelt: "Our war is to seek lasting peace, lasting peace. In addition to ending the war, we must also end the buds of all wars." We also believe that the demands and goals of the Chinese and Japanese people are consistent, and the rise of Japanese militarism is opposed by the Chinese and Japanese people. We commemorate the third anniversary of Japan's surrender, hoping to awaken the vigilance of the Allied countries, face the sacred spirit of the Potsdam Declaration squarely, convene a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible, thoroughly settle the Japan issue, and jointly support Japan to move towards a truly peaceful and democratic path in accordance with the provisions of the peace treaty. This is our greatest hope today.

### One Year of Indian Independence

— (Compiled by the Newspaper's Archives)

Last year on this day (August 15th), India formally gained independence and freedom, bringing an end to over a hundred years of British rule.

Looking back on the historical events of this year of independence, we can see that the new government has encountered many difficulties. First and foremost, the large-scale bloody conflicts that occurred on the border between India and Pakistan shortly after independence not only devastated the social economy of the area, but also created millions of displaced refugees, posing enormous challenges to the new government. In addition, famine widely threatened India, partly due to the partition plan that carved out major grain-producing areas from India, and partly due to the short-sighted policies of previous rulers, which caused periodic famines. Both of these issues, if not handled properly, could have impacted the future of the new country.

Today, India can proudly say that it has overcome the two major problems mentioned above, and its independent and free future is not threatened in the slightest. Refugees have been properly resettled and re-employed, the social economy of the Punjab province has also been rebuilt, and the extreme problems between India and Pakistan, after months of patient meetings and discussions, have been largely resolved. The future of the relationship between the two countries is much brighter than it was at the beginning of independence. The famine crisis has also been overcome, and for the first time in nearly six years, India can plan for a surplus of food?

In addition, there is another, more dangerous factor threatening India's survival, which is the conspiracy of internal extremists. They oppose the lofty ideals of the new Indian society of non-discrimination based on class or belief, and of religious equality and freedom, and deliberately sabotage it. The assassination of Gandhi on January 30th was the climax of this conspiracy. As a result, thanks to the government's just handling, broad-mindedness, and the mobilization of public opinion for sanctions, the elements of conspiracy and rebellion were finally suppressed.

Kingdoms' Accession

Since independence, more than six hundred kingdoms, occupying five hundred thousand square miles of land and seventy-five million people, have automatically acceded to the Indian territory. These many kingdoms were not part of British India in the past. They were independent political entities, only subject to British political control through treaty relations. Among them, the kingdom of Mysore, with eight million people, and the kingdom of Travancore, with six million people, both have modern industries and high administrative efficiency, and are very important among the kingdoms. The others are smaller. These many kingdoms are scattered throughout the region, and are interdependent with India in terms of economy, defense, and transportation. After India's independence, they have successively returned. Now, with the exception of the Kingdom of Hyderabad, the rest have transferred their political power to neighboring provinces. From then on, the power of the new Indian government has expanded from the Himalayas in the north to Cape Comorin in the south, greatly increasing the confidence of the newborn India.

Social Reform

The newborn India is also working hard on social reforms, eliminating the traditional concepts of non-interaction between various ethnic groups and classes, and legally affirming the improvement of women's status in society. The ancient Indian laws, which had not been amended in any way during the British rule, are now being carefully studied and revised. Another part of the new Indian code has been drafted and has been submitted to the legislative process.

Industrial Development

In the past year, despite the lack of essential tools, industrial development and the implementation of industrialization plans have achieved good results. Four hydroelectric power and irrigation projects have started one after another, benefiting vast lands with irrigation, and at the same time providing a large amount of electricity for industrial use. Among them, the Damodar Valley project is the largest, completely modeled after the American TVA design, which will completely change the face of Bihar Province. In March of this year, the first ship built in India was launched, and railway locomotives also began to be built by themselves. Many basic industries are being planned and implemented, and large-scale steel industries have also been planned by the government. The training of industrial technicians and the industrialization plan are being carried out in parallel. In the past, four higher technical personnel training centers were established, and a Scientific Research Department was established, directly supervised and directed by the Prime Minister of the Cabinet, to carry out large-scale research work, and to be responsible for scientific and technological guidance and cooperation.

Future Prospects

The above is a bright picture, but on the other hand, India still has some difficulties ahead, such as the Kingdom of Hyderabad's failure to agree to accede, and the Kashmir issue remaining unresolved. The Kashmir dispute has been submitted to the Security Council, but there is no hope of resolution, so military action is still continuing.

Despite these difficulties, India's achievements in the past year have been extremely brilliant. It has consolidated its international position and its currency is very stable. In particular, the new India has shown the world that it not only cherishes the independence and freedom it has worked so hard to obtain, but also has the determination and strength to maintain this independence and freedom.

### Formal Establishment of the Republic of Korea - Grand Ceremony Held in Seoul Today - Britain and Canada Prepare to Recognize the Korean Government

[United States Information Service, Seoul, 14th] The founding ceremony of the Republic of Korea will be held grandly tomorrow. MacArthur has decided to personally attend the ceremony in Seoul. The main speaker at the ceremony will be Syngman Rhee, the first president of the new republic.

[Chung Tien News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The President issued the following order on the 14th: Liu Yu-wan is specially appointed as the diplomatic representative with the title of Ambassador of the Republic of China to Korea. This order.

[This newspaper, Panyang, 14th] Korean residents in Panyang will hold a celebration meeting on the 15th to celebrate the establishment of the Korean government. Korean residents in Panyang will hang flags for a day to celebrate.

[United Press, London, 13th] A Foreign Office spokesperson stated today that Britain intends to recognize the South Korean government. They said that the issue of Britain's formal recognition of the South Korean government will be raised when the UN General Assembly studies the report of the Korean Commission. They said that the US government's establishment of a special relationship with the South Korean government is very legitimate, as the South Korean government was produced by a national election under the supervision of the United Nations.

[Agence France-Presse, Ottawa, 13th] According to Canadian radio broadcasts, the Canadian government is now considering de facto recognition of the South Korean government.

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The training of senior Korean military officers in the United States is now considered clear evidence of the United States' intention to cooperate with Koreans in South Korea to counter the overwhelming influence of the Soviet Union in North Korea.

### Protesting Soviet Kidnapping of Soviet Teachers - Discord Between US and Soviet Union Intensifies - State Department Refutes Soviet Accusations

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The US and the Soviet Union exchanged diplomatic accusations against each other on the 13th regarding the case of two Soviet teachers. The two teachers feared for their lives if they returned to their home country, and both seem likely to be granted asylum in the United States. The State Department publicly refuted Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's claim that the US government "acquiesced in the kidnapping" of Mrs. Kasenkina and Mr. Samarin. The State Department also indirectly but firmly rejected Molotov's demand to "release" the two and return them to the Soviet Union.

Department spokesman McDermott reiterated Secretary of State Marshall's remarks of several days ago, namely that protecting political prisoners who dare not return to their home country is the established policy of the United States. Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin had made two verbal protests to the State Department this week and requested and was granted a meeting with Under Secretary of State Lovett on the 13th, but the Soviet Embassy ultimately canceled the appointment, presumably due to the rapid development of the Kasenkina case. According to McDermott, he could not specifically state whether the Kasenkins would be allowed to stay in the United States, as the State Department had not yet received an official report on the case. Privately, US diplomats believe that the case has put Molotov in a very difficult position. They said that Molotov apparently did not know that Mrs. Kasenkina had fallen from the Soviet Consulate in New York the evening of the 12th, thus thwarting Soviet efforts to send her back to her home country, when he issued an angry denunciation on the evening of the 12th. Mrs. Kasenkina feared that once she returned to her home country and fell into their hands, her life would be in danger. The State Department's "Voice of America" radio station broadcast this matter to the world on the 13th.

### State Department Advisor Flies to New York to Investigate

[United Press, New York, 13th] State Department legal advisor Gross has flown here from Washington to meet with all local judicial authorities and immediately reiterate the State Department's provision that the diplomatic privileges of consular officials do not mean that they are exempt from punishment for criminal offenses. Gross added: "However, whether a crime can be found in the police report is still a hypothetical question. In view of the Soviet protest, I do not want to discuss this point at this time." He met with senior officials of the New York City Police Department, personnel of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and district attorneys of the federal and New York State for nearly an hour. Gross emphasized that the State Department is not participating in the investigation of Mrs. Kasenkina's special escape from the Soviet Consulate, "This is not the task of the State Department, but in responding to the Soviet protest and further discussions with the Soviet government, the information collected by local judicial authorities will be considered."

[Central News Agency, New York, 13th, United Press] State Department legal advisor Gross said that although consular officials enjoy diplomatic immunity, they should still be punished for criminal acts. Mrs. Kasenkina jumped out of a window on the third floor of the Soviet Consulate to escape, and the scene was extremely dangerous. O'Dwyer has ordered the police to prepare a report on the investigation of Mrs. Kasenkina's escape from the consulate and submit it to the judicial authorities. If it is proved that Mrs. Kasenkina was detained, then the crime of the Soviet Consulate will be established. The State Department stated that the immunity enjoyed by consular officials is different from that enjoyed by ambassadors and ministers.

### US-Soviet Friction Over Espionage Case Causes Concern in British Diplomatic Circles - May Thus Ruin Four-Power Negotiations

[United Press, London, 14th] Western diplomats, seeing the increasingly harsh rhetoric from Moscow, fear that the New York teacher case may undermine the success of the Kremlin's four-power negotiations. Observers point out that the Moscow discussions have entered a critical stage, and any major international event could shatter the glimmer of hope for a preliminary agreement on the Berlin and German issues. Western European diplomats here are particularly concerned about the so-called American "hysteria of espionage fear." One person compared the Kasenkina incident to the Canadian case and pointed out the differences in handling: the United States held sensational hearings by Congress, while Canada conducted an investigation by a Royal Commission, followed by prosecution, trial, and sentencing. One Western diplomat said: "Now is the time for calm reason. If there is ever a time when there is no need for nervous, irresponsible, and unnecessarily provocative actions, it is now."

### Soviet Consul General Detained Mrs. Kasenkina

US May File Indictment

[Central News Agency, New York, 13th, United Press] After Mrs. Kasenkina accused him of detaining her for six days, New York Mayor O'Dwyer stated today that the US will soon file an indictment for this, and the State Department will directly intervene.

[Central News Agency, New York, 14th] Mrs. Kasenkina, the Soviet teacher whose life-threatening jump from a window has further strained US-Soviet relations, is said to have stated to the police that she was not only confined in the Soviet Consulate, but that the Soviet ambassador to the US had personally met with her. According to the New York Times, Mrs. Kasenkina stated to the New York police authorities that Soviet Ambassador to the US Panyushkin had come to the consulate and tried to obtain evidence from her that she had not been detained. The statement reportedly stated that although Panyushkin had personally promised that she would not be punished by the Soviet side in the future, she still refused to sign the above evidence.

### US Investigating Committee Subpoenas Mrs. Kasenkina

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The investigation director of the House Un-American Activities Committee, Stripling, will go to New York tonight to subpoena Mrs. Kasenkina, the Soviet female teacher who was injured after jumping from a window inside the Soviet Consulate General. Stripling said that the House Un-American Activities Committee wants to hear any plans Mrs. Kasenkina has to say about communist control of the world.

[United Press, New York, 13th] The House Un-American Activities Committee issued a subpoena to Mrs. Kasenkina on the 13th. The committee's chief investigator, Stripling, left Washington at midnight on the 13th with the subpoena, instructing Mrs. Kasenkina to testify to the congressional espionage investigation agency "as soon as possible." He plans to deliver the subpoena to Mrs. Kasenkina on the morning of the 14th. According to the report on the morning of the 13th, Mrs. Kasenkina is still in "dangerous condition," lying quietly in a heavily guarded ward at Roosevelt Hospital.

### Soviet Vice Consul Meets Mrs. Kasenkina

But Refuses to Meet Soviet Consul General

[United Press, New York, 13th] Mrs. Kasenkina, the Soviet female teacher who fell from the fourth-floor window of the Soviet Consulate on the 12th, accused Soviet personnel on the 13th of imprisoning her for six days. When Soviet Vice Consul Kibrik entered Mrs. Kasenkina's ward on the morning of the 13th, Mrs. Kasenkina told him, "You imprisoned me and won't let me go." She refused to meet Soviet Consul General Lomakin. Mrs. Kasenkina kept her eyes closed for most of the time while Kibrik was in the ward. When she opened her eyes, Mrs. Kasenkina did not look at Kibrik. Police are on high alert around Roosevelt Hospital to prevent any attempts to harm Mrs. Kasenkina's life.

### Marshall Refuses to Investigate UN Files

[United States Information Service, Washington, 13th] Secretary of State Marshall has refused to allow a Senate subcommittee to investigate the confidential passport files of representatives of the United Nations and other international organizations in the United States. Marshall's position is explained in a letter to Senator Revercomb (Republican Senator from West Virginia), chairman of the Senate subcommittee. The task of the subcommittee is to determine whether foreign secret agents are entering the United States under the guise of serving the United Nations. The letter was dated August 7 and released by the State Department today. The Secretary of State pointed out, "Much of the material in the files was obtained confidentially by our country's diplomatic missions abroad, so its confidentiality must be maintained."

### Nehru Calls for Peace on First Anniversary of Indian Independence - Hopes for International Cooperation to Realize the Ideal of Great Harmony

[United Press, New Delhi, 14th] Prime Minister Nehru met with reporters alone for the first time on the 14th, the first anniversary of India's independence. He told a United Press reporter that unless the world can develop into a global federation and Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries agree to coexist within this federation, the world will face a crisis of suicide. Nehru called on major powers to make sincere efforts to resolve disputes and not to attempt to condemn each other. Although he believes that the crisis of a third world war has been somewhat reduced recently, the powder keg still exists because Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have not made genuine efforts to resolve their differences.

He said: "Between the United States and the Soviet Union, not only are there inconsistencies, but they also hope to create inconsistencies. Both sides are deliberately trying to make the other feel uncomfortable, so the first step that must be taken is the willingness of both sides to reach an agreement. This willingness may not necessarily lead to an agreement, but it is at least a big step forward. A considerable form of world government must emerge in our generation or the next, otherwise the world will be on the path to suicide. Its form and how to build it are still difficult to say now, but it must grow in the credibility of the people." Nehru expressed his views on the form of world government, believing that the world government must be a loose federal system, not only built on a legislative basis, but also on the psychological change in the people's thinking.

India's Future Gradually Brightens

In reviewing India's first year of independence, Nehru said that although India will have disputes over immigration issues, its future is bright. He admitted that India is in an unstable economic situation due to inflation, but he said that the government has taken several measures to save the economic crisis.

Agrees with US Policy Toward Japan

Nehru expressed his approval of the US policy of rebuilding the Japanese economy, saying: "It is unwise to completely suppress a nation like Japan. Reviving Japan on a democratic basis is the only correct policy that can be taken, but appropriate safeguards must be taken to prevent Japan from reorganizing militarism." He believes that the current outbreak of communist activities in Asia is due to economic conditions, which must be remedied. He said: "The most important way to deal with communism is to improve the economic environment."

Regarding the Hyderabad and Kashmir issues, he said: "If Hyderabad insists on its own way, India's independence will become a joke, and the entire southern India will be in danger." Nehru expressed his dissatisfaction with the United Nations' mediation of the methods of India and Pakistan, saying: "To understand the situation in Kashmir, you must understand a basic fact, which is the foreign aggression from Pakistan."

### Three Nations' Envoys Receive New Instructions - To Meet with Molotov Again - Robertson Summoned Back to England for Consultation

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th] British Military Governor of Germany General Robertson, US Governor Hays, and French Deputy Governor Noirot, were suddenly summoned to London one after another today for consultation on the Berlin crisis and the current Moscow talks.

[United Press, London, 14th] This question newspaper hinted today that the Moscow deadlock may be broken. This news was published at the same time as the return of British Military Governor of Germany Robertson to London. Robertson met with Foreign Secretary Bevin and Foreign Undersecretary Strang on the 14th to provide information on the German situation to assist in the Moscow talks.

A dispatch from Moscow said that, according to reliable sources, Western envoys have received new instructions, including the terms to be proposed at the next meeting with Molotov. It is also known that the three envoys are discussing the drafting of a memorandum at the US Embassy as usual. As soon as it is completed, they will ask the Soviet Foreign Ministry to decide the time for a meeting with Molotov, possibly on the evening of the 14th or the 15th.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th] The three-nation committee composed of Strang, Director of the German Affairs Department of the British Foreign Office, Douglas, the US Ambassador to the United Kingdom, and Massigli, the French Ambassador to the United Kingdom, met this afternoon to discuss the report from British envoy Roberts on his recent meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. The British Foreign Office is still keeping the news of the Moscow talks strictly secret. Qualified parties all denied the shocking news hinted at by the American newspapers that Britain will now unconditionally accept Soviet participation in West German administration. They pointed out that this news actually only changed what the London Agreement itself said into a shocking way. It should be known that the door to West German political institutions is wide open, and the Soviet Union can join at any time, but the administration of the East Zone must also comply with the democratic principles recognized by the West. As for the Soviet Union's participation in the control of the Ruhr area, Britain will carefully consider this when the Soviet Union continues to refuse to allow the Western powers to participate in the various industries in the Soviet-occupied zone, and refuses to allow the Western powers to continue to enjoy the right to jointly manage the navigation of the Danube River as stipulated in the 1921 Danube River Convention. Judging from the attitude taken by Soviet representative Vyshinsky at the Danube River Conference, the Soviet Union's participation in the control of the Ruhr area has become a very big question.

### Germany Asks to Reject Soviet Currency - Circulation in West Germany

[United Press, Berlin, 13th] The three major non-communist political parties in Germany, namely the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Union, and the Free Democratic Party, together with the anti-Soviet trade union executive committee, submitted a memorandum to the military governments of the three Western powers today, requesting that the Western countries refuse to recognize the Mark issued by the Soviet Union as the only legal currency in Berlin, and requesting that the Western Mark be immediately declared the only currency in the Western part. They also urged that the economies of West Berlin and the Western occupied zones be integrated.

### Romania Incorporated into the Soviet Union - Romanian Embassy in the UK Denies

[Central News Agency, London, 13th] The Romanian Embassy in this question officially denied the rumor that the country will soon be merged into the Soviet Union. The Romanian Embassy expressed its dissatisfaction with the Ankara radio station, which first broadcast the news, believing that this was an intentional act of insulting the dignity of the Romanian people.

### Soviet Army Reiterates Demand - US, Britain, and France Withdraw from Berlin - Soviet Personnel Withdraw from the Four-Power Headquarters

[United Press, Berlin, 14th] The Soviet Army reiterated its demand on the 14th, publicly ordering the Western countries to withdraw from Berlin, on the grounds that the Soviet Union has guaranteed to supply food to the entire Berlin, and there is no need for the Western countries to continue to station there. The Soviet military government also claimed that the Soviet Union will also supply fat to the entire city of Berlin. The newspapers registered with the Soviet Union unanimously praised the Soviet measures, and praised them as completely overturning the foundations established by the Western countries in Berlin.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 13th] The Soviet military government authorities completely withdrew their personnel from the four-power headquarters in the US-occupied zone this morning. The four national flags that were simultaneously hung on the roof of the headquarters every day have now been reduced to three. The Soviet guards also withdrew several days ago, taking all the documents with them, but the portraits of Lenin and Stalin in the office were forgotten. Currently, the only institutions in Berlin that are still jointly participated in by the four countries are the secretariat of the Four-Power Control Council, the Aviation Safety Agency, Spandau Prison, and the Central Telephone Bureau.

### Organization of the Danube Commission - Limited to Riparian States - US Amendment Vetoed

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 13th] At this morning's meeting of the Danube River Conference, the article stipulating that the organization of the future Danube River Commission should be limited to the Danube River countries was passed by a vote of seven to three (Britain, the United States, and France). The conference also passed several technical articles by a vote of seven to two. The articles involve the establishment of special Romanian-Soviet and Romanian-Yugoslav administrative offices to manage the tributaries of the Danube River passing through Romania or Yugoslavia. The conference also passed an amendment by a vote of seven to one (the United States), stipulating the establishment of a special administrative office for the tributaries of the Danube River passing through the Czech and Hungarian parts. Finally, the conference rejected the amendment proposed by the United States by a vote of seven to three, which advocated reducing the powers of this special administrative office.

### Communist Intelligence Bureau Predicts - Tito Will Fall Sooner or Later

[This newspaper] London, 14th Broadcast: The Communist International Intelligence Bureau issued a communique predicting that Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito and his staff will sooner or later be stripped of their qualifications as leaders of the Yugoslav Communist Party. Protests against the destruction of the Natron water station

### Imminent Outbreak of Full-Scale War in the Holy Land

Jewish Protest Against Destruction of Natrun Water Station

[United Press International, Tel Aviv, 14th] Israeli officials are quietly awaiting the Security Council's response to the Arab destruction of the Natrun water station. However, officials here believe that the United Nations will not condemn the act as a violation of the ceasefire. The Arabs' bombing of the pumping station has brought the prestige of UN mediator Count Bernadotte to a low ebb. Israeli newspapers bluntly advise him to "pack his bags and go home." The Foreign Ministry believes that the United Nations will take some "face-saving action" but will not condemn the Arabs as aggressors. Meanwhile, the Israeli government has already prepared for the fifth stage of the Jewish-Arab conflict - a war of attrition. Therefore, the opposing armies are ready to resume full-scale war at any time.

[Agence France-Presse, Tel Aviv, 13th] Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok has protested to the Security Council, accusing Bernadotte of neglect. The most important point is that Bernadotte failed to ensure the supply of water to Jerusalem and allowed the Arab destruction of the Natrun water station.

### Provisional Municipal Assembly Resolves to Reduce Public Utility Prices: Across-the-Board Cancellation of the 50% Increase Based on July's Index; Future Prices to Be Approved by a Public Investigation and Review Committee

[Our Report] The first Provisional Municipal Assembly of this city, established on the 35th anniversary of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, convened its first extraordinary meeting yesterday to discuss the issue of reducing public utility prices. The meeting began at 3:45 PM, attended by over 160 councilors, Mayor Wu, Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau, and numerous responsible officials from other relevant municipal departments. The meeting began with Chairman Pan reporting on the purpose of the extraordinary meeting, offering two points for discussion: (1) How to provisionally determine prices while considering both the burden on citizens and the continued operation of public utilities. (2) Given the limited time available for this extraordinary meeting, please first consider how to reduce August's new prices, and propose a reasonable calculation method for adjusting prices from September onwards. Furthermore, a proposal from the Mayor was submitted today to organize a Public Investigation and Review Committee for Public Utilities to examine the actual necessary expenditures of various public utilities in the city, in order to determine a price adjustment method to be followed, and it was also submitted for discussion.

Following this, Zhi Hao, one of the conveners of the Municipal Assembly's Public Utilities Committee, reported on the process of repeated meetings of the Public Utilities Committee and subcommittees. After Li Wenjie made a supplementary report on the progress, Mayor Wu reported on his submitted proposal. He pointed out three reasons for especially maintaining public utilities: (1) The profits of public utilities are restricted. (2) They cannot hoard or refuse to sell. (3) They cannot sell goods and collect money at the same time. Reduced adjusted prices can be achieved only if one of the following three conditions is met: (1) If it is found that there are false or reducible items in the account books of various public utilities. (2) If there is a subsidy method. (3) If there is a possibility of obtaining a loan. He stated: "For two years, I have shared weal and woe with the councilors, and I have never encountered such a problem. Therefore, I propose organizing a Public Investigation and Review Committee for Public Utilities to publicly review various issues related to public utilities."

At 5:25 PM, the formal discussion began. Councilors Ma Junshuo, Zhang Zhongyuan, Fei Shusheng, Shao Yongsheng, Jin Runxiang, Fan Xipin, Jiang Huaishu, Wang Jianshi, Yu Shun, Wang Weiyin, Yan Esheng, He Chengfu, Zhou Ruting, Jiang Haoran, Zhu Wende, Qu Yue, Yang Fusheng, and others successively put forward oral or written opinions. At around 8:00 PM, the chairman summarized the councilors' opinions as follows:

Summary of Opinions: Regarding the issue of how to reduce the new prices adjusted in August for various public utilities in the city and what standards should be adopted after September to verify and calculate their prices, the Public Utilities Committee of the Assembly has submitted a review report, and the Mayor has also submitted a separate proposal, both of which have been submitted to the general meeting for discussion. It has been found that if the new price reduction method for public utilities in August is implemented according to the review opinions of the Public Utilities Committee, and fees are charged at the lowest price uniformly, large users of electricity, telephone, gas, etc. can obtain the effect of price reduction, but small users and industrial electricity users have not yet benefited. The nature of tap water and transportation tools is very different, and the rigid requirement to increase the price by 740% compared to July is also still to be considered. Furthermore, after listening to the Mayor's report, if the new price is reduced, the various companies may currently experience a shortage of funds. The various companies should bear their own responsibilities, but in order for the Assembly to enable the continued supply of various public utilities for citizens to enjoy, and to prevent a lack of funds, it seems that an emergency assistance measure should also be taken. As for the temporary standard for calculating the price of public utilities each month after September, the content of the review opinions of the Public Utilities Committee is quite detailed. However, if it needs to be implemented, there should still be a dedicated research and review organization to continue its unfinished work.

Three Resolutions: To achieve a fair reduction of the new prices in August and a more reasonable pricing method after September, it is specifically resolved as follows:

(1) Method for reducing the new prices adjusted for public utilities in August:

1.  Part of Water, Electricity, and Gas: In the formulas used to calculate the new prices in August, any part that uses the cost of living index, exchange rate index, and metal index, the 50% increase based on the actual index in July will be cancelled across the board, and recalculated to reduce. For accounts that should be reduced for each user, those that have not been collected will not be collected, and those that have been collected will be refunded.

2.  Part of Transportation Tools (excluding telephones): Starting from August 18th, the new prices will be reduced by 20%-30% across the board. Each fare will be adjusted accordingly, rounded to the nearest ten thousand.

3.  Part of Telephones: In the formulas used to calculate the new prices in August, any part that uses the cost of living index, exchange rate index, and metal index, the 50% increase based on the actual index in July, and the so-called price difference compensation index will be cancelled across the board, and recalculated to reduce. For accounts that should be reduced for each user, those that have not been collected will not be collected, and those that have been collected will be refunded.

4.  If various public utility companies experience a shortage of funds due to the price reduction in August, in addition to the fact that the board of directors of each company should be responsible for making adjustments, the municipal government will join with the Assembly to organize a petition group to request loans from the central government.

(2) Implementation standards for calculating the price of public utilities each month from September onwards:

1.  The final revised and issued review opinions from the Public Utilities Committee, items 1 to 5, are all approved. However, item 6, the review opinions and the opinions of Councilor Li Wenjie, are sent to the Public Investigation and Review Committee for Public Utilities for study and decision.

2.  The standards for tiered pricing for electricity and telephones should be revised according to the actual situation in the city to be consistent with the true meaning of socialized pricing.

3.  The problem of adapting the supply period of electricity, gas, tap water, etc. to the corresponding payment period should be reasonably regulated.

The above three items are handed over to the investigation and review committee to be organized later for handling.

(3) From September onwards, the pricing of various public utilities in the city will be handled by a publicly-oriented investigation and review committee organized by the municipal government inviting representatives and experts from the Assembly and relevant statutory groups in the city. The committee may request the municipal government to access all relevant accounts and documents, and no public entity may refuse to access them under any pretext. The organizational methods of the committee will be determined separately by the municipal government. As for the selection of Assembly members, the president and vice president are authorized to consult with the Public Utilities Committee to select them, but they are not limited to the members of the Public Utilities Committee. When the committee calculates the price of public utilities from September onwards, it should refer to the various principles listed in the review report of the Assembly's Public Utilities Committee as the standard.

### Smuggling Uncovered on the Haijin Steamer: Piles of Gold Worth an Estimated 500 Billion

The Jianghai Customs Anti-Smuggling Division received intelligence from Hong Kong on the 11th, stating that the China Merchants Bureau's Haijin steamer, coming from Hong Kong to Shanghai, was suspected of having a huge amount of gold smuggled by the sailors on board. Therefore, on the evening of the 12th, at 8:00 PM, a large number of officers were dispatched in disguise to wait at the China Merchants Bureau's First Wharf. At 11:10 PM that night, the steamer entered the port and berthed, but after waiting until 8:00 AM on the 13th, nothing was found. It was decided to take action and board the ship for a search that lasted an hour. As a result, a package wrapped in paper was found in an iron cabinet in the second head sailor's bedroom. When opened, it turned out to be 75 gold bars, with an estimated value of around 500 billion. However, due to the lack of confidentiality, the second head sailor, Zhang, had already fled upon hearing the news, so he could not be arrested.

### First-Half Index: Increase Less Than Double

Published This Morning After Review

The cost of living index for the first half of this month will be published by the Municipal Government Cost of Living Index Review Committee after a meeting at the Municipal Government at 10:00 AM today. According to speculation from relevant parties, although the price increase rates for rationed rice and public utilities are quite high, the price increase rates for general grains, clothing, housing, and daily necessities such as soap and cigarettes are slower. Therefore, if based on the price statistics of the above items, the worker's cost of living index for the first half of this month will definitely be less than double the previous period.

### Municipal Finances Increasingly Difficult: Tian Yongqian Proposes Two Methods

The city's finances are becoming increasingly difficult. Director of Finance Tian Yongqian submitted a written report at yesterday's Provisional Municipal Assembly, suggesting two methods: (1) Following proper channels, request a short-term subsidy from the central government, and ask the Assembly to support this and forward it to the central government for prompt approval. (2) The Finance Bureau is carefully researching and drafting a plan to adjust revenue by the relevant departments, and submitting it to the Assembly for review. If it is considered feasible, please approve and implement it at any time, and report it to the general meeting for retroactive approval in order to seize the time.

### District Prosecutor's Office Prosecutes Two Merchants for Forging Export Permits to Ship Flour

[Our Report] Ding Xingfu, director of the customs declaration department of Yongfengli Customs Brokerage in this city, previously transported 5,000 bags of flour to Yantai for merchant Ma Jianzhai. On August 2nd of this year, he used a forged food department export permit No. 19893, provided by Ma, to go to the customs to complete customs declaration procedures. Sun Zhongyi, manager of Shuncheng Customs Brokerage, transported 15,000 bags of flour to Qingdao for merchant Ge Chengzhai.

The customs officers determined that both of the above permits were forged and handed them over to the District Prosecutor's Office. After the investigation was completed, Ding and Sun were prosecuted for the crime of forging documents.

### Direct Tax Bureau Reduces Staff: Ministry of Finance Dispatches Investigators: Handling Methods to Be Announced Tomorrow

[Our Report] After the Direct Tax Bureau of this city issued an order from the Ministry to dismiss 112 staff members on the 11th, two of them were veterans transferred to civilian jobs. After negotiations, they were reinstated. As for the other 110 dismissed staff members, they were greatly panicked and believed that the layoffs were unfair, so they organized a "Federation of Laid-Off Personnel" and actively appealed to all parties for justice in recent days. It is said that the Ministry of Finance has set eight standards for the Direct Tax Bureau to reduce staff.

Subsequently, on the 11th, the Direct Tax Bureau announced supplementary measures, including one that stated that if necessary after layoffs according to the above eight standards, further layoffs could be carried out based on the performance appraisal from January to June of the 37th year. However, the bureau did not fully comply with the previous eight standards when implementing the layoffs this time. On the 12th, the laid-off personnel requested Huang Zupei, the director of the bureau, to publicly handle the layoffs and strictly implement the Ministry's regulations. Director Huang immediately went to Beijing to request instructions from the Ministry of Finance. Zhao Peifeng, director of the personnel department of the National Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance, and Dou Mengfei, specially commissioned, came to Shanghai yesterday to investigate. The Federation of Laid-Off Personnel sent representatives to meet with the Ministry's representatives yesterday morning. The two representatives replied that public review was impossible, but the reinstatement of those who passed the special examination could be considered. Regarding aftercare issues, they stated that it was not within the scope of their responsibilities. Finally, they instructed the representatives of the laid-off personnel to collect information on the unreasonable aspects of the Direct Tax Bureau's layoffs this time and provide it for reference today, and the handling methods will be announced tomorrow.

They are currently launching fundraising efforts separately. At a time when the sun is scorching, the efforts of Shen and others to run around for the poor children are admirable. It is hoped that all enthusiastic people in this city will respond actively, contributing their efforts and money, with the same meaning, so that the fundraising for the education aid fund will reach the expected goal as soon as possible.

Furthermore, the donation income obtained from this year's education aid fund was originally intended to be used to purchase short-term treasury bills to generate interest. Later, the China & South Sea Bank generously agreed to provide the highest monthly interest rate, and this newspaper has agreed to do so.

### Number One Japanese War Criminal Okamura: Six Points Interrogated in Preliminary Hearing: Public Trial Scheduled for the 23rd at the Municipal Assembly

[Our Report] Before the official public trial of Okamura Neiji, the number one Japanese war criminal and former commander-in-chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China, the military court held a preliminary hearing yesterday morning for initial questioning. Okamura claimed to be unaware of and unable to take responsibility for the crimes committed by his subordinates, such as killing our people and destroying our property. After the hearing, he was returned to the Jiangwan War Criminal Prison. The public trial is scheduled for the 23rd at the Municipal Assembly on Tanggu Road, where lawyers Jiang Yiping and Qian Longsheng will defend him.

At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the military court dispatched Adjutant Guo Xinfu and gendarmes to the hospital to bring forward Okamura, and the hearing began at 9:00 AM. Judge Shi Meiyu, military judge Zhang Tikun, Ye Zaizeng, clerk Hu Minduo, and translator Luo Di first investigated Okamura's resume. Okamura wore a gray suit, self-lined shirt, blue floral tie, and yellow leather shoes. Due to the sequelae of lung disease, he appeared quite weak, but his complexion was still good. According to his statement: He is 65 years old, from Tokyo, and graduated from the Army University, successively serving as Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Director of the Second Department of the General Staff Headquarters, Lieutenant General of the 2nd Division, Commander of the 11th Army, and General of the 6th Area Army. In December of the 33rd year of the Republic, he was promoted to Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Forces, until the Japanese surrender.

Six Points of Questioning - Answers One by One: After Okamura finished stating his resume, he rested for a few minutes, and Judge Shi began questioning, with the questions divided into the following points: (1) Was it an order or his own intention to serve as the commander in China? (2) As a general, how many times did he participate in the Supreme Military Conference of the Greater East Asia War? (3) Before serving as commander-in-chief, Okamura had already fought in China. Was he aware of the killing and arson by the Japanese army? (4) Should Okamura be held responsible for the crimes of murder and arson committed by the 27th Division Commander Ochiai Shinkuro, the 116th Division Commander Hishida Harushiro, the 55th Brigade Major General Brigade Commander Nashioka Hisao, and the Changsha Garrison Commander Funahiki Masayuki, etc., during the war? (5) How many Japanese troops were scattered in China at the time of the Japanese surrender? (6) Was he also responsible for the Japanese Navy and Air Force? Okamura stated regarding the above points: (1) Serving as the supreme commander of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China was an order from the government. (2) He did not participate in the Supreme Military Conference of the Greater East Asia War. (3) He did not know about various incidents such as the killing by the Japanese army. He had made an appointment with his subordinates after serving as commander-in-chief. (4) He cannot be held responsible for the crimes of the Ochiai Shinkuro Division, etc., because there are area armies under the commander-in-chief, and army headquarters under the area armies. The division is under the jurisdiction of the headquarters, which is two levels away from the general headquarters, so the division commander should be responsible for their crimes. (5) He did not know exactly how many Japanese troops were in China at the time of the Japanese surrender, probably less than one million. (6) Part of the air force was under his command, but the navy and naval landing forces had their own system. In addition to answering the court's questions verbally, Okamura also presented a written defense in court, the content of which was roughly divided into two points: (1) The responsibility for the crimes of the Japanese army killing Chinese civilians listed in the indictment should be borne by the directly subordinate commanding officer, the division commander. (2) He presented various proofs that he had tried to prevent his subordinates from harming our people.

Smiling Bitterly When Answering Reporters' Questions: The preliminary hearing lasted about three-quarters of an hour before it was adjourned. Okamura was surrounded by reporters, who asked questions one after another. He expressed his gratitude for the lenient and benevolent spirit of the Chinese government and said that he was willing to use his greatest strength to help the Chinese government. When asked if he had any complaints about today's trial, Okamura smiled bitterly, thought for a while, and could not answer. He used to study Buddhism when he was a division commander to calm his mind, and now he hopes to spend the day of the public trial on the 23rd peacefully. He believes that the military revival of Japan is absolutely impossible because Japan is under control, while the weapons of other countries are constantly improving. Okamura also stated his feelings: He is willing to contribute his past experience in the military to China to enable China's military revival, which is the shortcut to stabilizing East Asia.

Judge Shi Fuyu told reporters that the verdict on Okamura Mitsuji would be based on an attitude of no revenge and no leniency. After the public trial is completed, he will exchange views on the verdict with the military judges hearing the case, and the majority opinion will be the final decision, and then he will submit it to the President for approval.

### Murder Case in Front of Liangyuan Gate: Painter Killed by a Single Punch

[Reported by this newspaper] Liangyuan Laozheng and Restaurant at 332 Guangxi Road have recently been using the summer break to hire workers to paint the facade.

The assailant, Wang Shiqing, was immediately apprehended by neighbors and handed over to the Laozha Police Sub-bureau for investigation.

### Kuling Welcomes the President in August

— Special Dispatch from Kuling by this Newspaper on the 9th, Correspondent Liu Wenqu

Kuling in August is still so tranquil. The temperature hovers between 70 and 80 degrees, neither cold nor hot. After occasional showers or heavy fogs, it is even cooler and more pleasant. With clear mountains and beautiful waters, tourists stroll leisurely through the springs and forests, watching the flowing clouds and water, and feeling as if they are drifting outside the world. There is no tense disturbance in the market, and everything seems to be passing by peacefully.

The President and his wife did not fail the expectations of the people of Kuling and the scenery of Mount Lu, and finally arrived! They arrived amidst the applause of thousands of people who voluntarily lined up to welcome them. This is the President's first visit to Kuling! The smiles of the President and his wife when they greeted the welcoming crowd gave the people of Kuling infinite comfort and left a very deep impression.

The aircraft of the attendants landed at the Shili Pu Airport at more than 9:00 in the morning on the 9th. Walking along the main road from Xin Street, you can see the airport from the mountain gap not far away, but no one seemed to notice it in the morning. Deputy Adjutant General Liu Yuanlin came up the mountain quietly with some people. At noon, they had lunch at No. 39 (the Lixingshe house). Someone saw them and spread the word: "The President is here!"

The most powerful proof is still the President and his wife's vehicle. At 2:15, the sedan chairs carried out from the official residence are recognizable to everyone. The porters wear dark blue uniforms and straw hats, and they are carrying the sedan chairs through the busiest main street. The first sedan chair is empty. After it passes, the second one follows, with someone sitting in it. On closer inspection, it turns out to be Wang Zuomin, the Director of the Administration Bureau. He is going down to Lotus Cave to greet them. Someone is calculating the time the sedan chairs are descending. Judging from the situation, they may arrive at 5 or 6 o'clock.

From 3:00 PM to 8:00 PM, there are more and more people on the street. At least half of the people of Kuling have come out, and the two main streets, Zheng Street and Xin Street, are filled with people. Military police and police are doing everything they can to open a path and block people on both sides. When there is not enough space to accommodate everyone, they extend along the Lian-Gu Avenue, extending for nearly a mile. People who extend out have an unexpected convenience. They can see the airport from the gap, watch the "Meiling" plane take off and land, and also see the Baneshan Pavilion on the opposite mountain and the progress of the sedan chairs on the winding mountain road.

The reflection of the setting sun obscured the fuselage of the "Meiling" plane. At 6:30, the "Meiling" plane landed at Shili Pu. From a distance, the airport, which is only two inches long and one inch wide, only has a black spot on it. Estimating the time, it should be possible to reach Baneshan Pavilion by 7:30. The eyes of the public are staring straight at the opposite mountain, fully expressing their enthusiastic expectations.

The distant mountains and nearby forests are even more beautiful in the evening glow. The scorching sun loses its power, and a gentle breeze blows. Waiting for the arrival of the President and his wife seems more interesting than sightseeing. While waiting, the sun sets behind the mountains, and the twilight deepens. Friends with cameras cannot help but sigh, while on the mountainside of the opposite mountain, the shadows of several mountain sedan chairs faintly appear. Watching them progress, turn, and disappear behind the mountain, they reappear soon after. After passing the Baneshan Pavilion and the Monument, isn't this reaching Tianchikou? The President and his wife are now approaching the enthusiastic crowd step by step. Everyone can freely admire the demeanor of the head of state and his wife. Applause drowns out everything.

Passing through the ranks of people, there are a total of four sedan chairs. The first is the Madam, who greets the people with smiles and waves. The second is the President, who takes off his cork hat and greets the people, constantly nodding and smiling. The third is Yu Jishi, and the fourth is Shi Zude - it is said that this is always the order when climbing Kuling. Some of the attendants are following on foot. The President's long-term porters, eight per sedan chair, can be described as walking like flying. Just as people want to carefully admire them, the sedan chair quickly passes by, leaving only the smiles given by the head of state and his wife.

The order is quite good, and the applause is constant. Even after the President and his wife have passed, the welcoming crowd remains in line to wait. At 8:20, the President and his wife passed through Zheng Street and turned towards Hedong Road.

Soon after the President and his wife entered the official residence, the stars in the clear sky kept blinking, as if they also hoped to catch up with this lively scene. As night fell, Kuling returned to tranquility.

It is said that the main purpose of the President and his wife's visit to Kuling this time is to escape the summer heat and rest. Think about it, the President has such a heavy burden on his shoulders. From preparation to constitutional government, there are countless political disturbances; from peace talks to suppressing the rebellion, there are some military successes and failures. Working hard day and night, he should have a short period of rest in this hot summer. It is said that the President plans to rest in Kuling for two weeks, reducing the burden of government affairs as much as possible. The rumored meeting has already been held. In Kuling, there will not be an excessive burden on our head of state. Today is certainly tiring. From tomorrow onwards, Mount Lu will quietly accept the President and his wife's appreciation.

### 250,000 Yuan Denomination Gold Bond Notes to be Officially Issued Starting Tomorrow: Central Bank Official Says the Cash Panic Can Be Resolved

[Reported by this newspaper] Gold Bond Notes with a denomination of 250,000 yuan will be issued tomorrow. These gold bond notes are printed by the Central Printing Plant and have a bright red color similar to the 5 yuan denomination gold bond notes.

According to a responsible person from the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank, the cash shortage in various places can be resolved after the issuance of the 250,000 yuan denomination gold bond notes. Recently, due to the excessive rise in prices, although the National Bank has issued gold bond notes with denominations of 10,000, 25,000, and 50,000 yuan, there is still a lack of chips in the market. Therefore, at the request of the National Bank, it threw out the original 5,000 yuan denomination of legal currency that was scheduled to be redeemed to meet the needs of the market, which was a last resort. After the 250,000 yuan gold bond notes are issued, the cash panic can be resolved, and the 5,000 yuan small notes can be redeemed in large quantities and will no longer be circulated in the market.

Also, the money market turned from loose to stable yesterday. In the exchange of bills between the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury and the silver and money industry, there was a large difference in advances, totaling 207.3 billion yuan. Among them, the Central Bank's difference in advances was 28.914 billion yuan, the Bank of China's difference in advances was 2.772 billion yuan, the Bank of Communications' difference in advances was 5 billion yuan, the Farmers Bank's difference in advances was 12.732 billion yuan, the China Investment Trust Bureau's difference in advances was 4.214 billion yuan, the Postal Remittance Bureau's difference in advances was 2.752 billion yuan, the Central Cooperative Treasury's difference in advances was 818 billion yuan, the commercial banks' large exchange difference in advances was 110.346 billion yuan, the small exchange difference in advances was 38.7 billion yuan, and the foreign banks' difference in advances was 28.315 billion yuan.

Also, yesterday, because it was the weekend and the middle of the month, the industry urgently needed it, so the tight cash situation worsened again, and the discount rate in the market rose to one-tenth. The demand for shipping help was even greater than before. The Central Bank also reduced the amount of funds for the same industry, and the exchange numbers before 50 were only 10 billion to 20 billion, and all the others were 5 billion. The national banks and bureaus also only had 30 billion to 50 billion. Therefore, the banks had to severely limit cash withdrawals for customers. Generally, they were allowed 20 million yuan, and some small banks only allowed 5 million yuan.

### Rice Prices Continue to Soar: Retail Prices Break the 70 Million Mark; Rumor That Rice Rationing Will Be Stopped is Untrue

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, rice prices in the city continued to soar. Because of rumors that food will be urgently purchased, people are optimistic, and market conditions have skyrocketed. Retail prices have reached the 70 million mark. The wholesale prices of other commodities, due to the impact of the revival of rumors, slightly tighter money, and other bearish news, have fallen across the board. Cotton cloth, rayon, and silk have all fallen by about 10%, while the prices of yarn and cigarettes and other items are still stable. However, the wholesale prices and retail prices of commodities yesterday seemed to be disconnected, because the monthly cost of living index is about to be released, and stores have raised retail prices in advance, and the price increase of daily necessities is very alarming.

Also, after the rice price skyrocketed, it was rumored in the market that the rationing of grain per capita will also be forced to stop. Wu Guozhen, the chairman of the People's Livelihood Committee, solemnly denied this. He also stated that the rice distributed by the Municipal People's Livelihood Committee will not be affected by the rice price in any way, because the rice for the ninety-day month has already been prepared, and half of the rice for November has also been prepared. Therefore, the rumor that rice rationing will be stopped is absolutely untrue.

The rice market is rising rapidly. Because of the sharp increase in the price of Wuxi, people are excited, causing the cargo owners to try their best to raise the price. The Beishi market once saw an increase of 6 or 7 million yuan, and the closing price turned low. The special high-quality Japonica rice reached 67 million, and other Japonica rice has reached the 60 million mark, each rising by 10%. However, the closing price was 2 million lower due to the decline in various items outside the industry, and people were also empty. The Nanshi market opened 5 or 6 million higher in the early morning, and the closing price became sluggish, with the price falling by 1 or 2 million yuan. Yesterday, a total of 6,840 Shi of goods arrived in the North and South markets.

Flour

Due to the scarcity of wheat, the factory price on the previous day was as high as 24 million. People were unanimously optimistic. The early market price for old cars opened at 25 million, but retreated due to the high opening price. The closing price was even more sluggish due to the low prices of various items outside the industry. As a result, the old car retreated to a closing price of 23.4 million, with a large price fluctuation. The closing price for military ships was 22.7 million, which was still 1.12 million yuan higher than the previous day. Hongfeng and Jiancheng each opened at 23 million. Bran rose by 1 million, and the factory price of wheat rose by another 4 million, opening at 33 million.

Miscellaneous Grains

Continued to rise. The initial market was sharply rising, and the closing price turned weak. The soybean oil gangs continued to take deliveries. The early market rose by 4 or 5 million, and the closing price fell by 2 million due to the decline in oil cake. The Qingdao gang took a lot of corn, rising by 5 million. The closing price was also weak. Yuanmai was taken by both the North and South gangs, rising by 4 million. Sesame rose slightly by 1 million, and the Guang gang did not take raw peanuts, falling by 2 million alone.

Cooking Oil

Turned to the downstream trend. Because the previous day's rise was too much, and because the prices of items outside the industry fell, those who were sensitive to the news took the opportunity to exit the market, and retail investors vomited out the goods. Soybean oil was initially 163 million, and the closing price was 159 million, slightly decreasing by 2 million. Rapeseed oil also slightly fell by 1 or 2 million yuan, raw oil fell by 3 million, Jittong raw oil was 195 million, and the initial market for small car sesame oil was stable, with the closing price falling by 5 million. The bean cake was not taken by the customer gang, and no one cared about it, falling by 30 to 500,000.

### Foreign Exchange Certificates Continue to Rise: Gold Ornaments Rise by Another 20 Million

Yesterday, the market price of foreign exchange certificates continued to rise sharply, opening at 7.2 million yuan in the morning. Then, due to the fierce purchase by importers, it rose to 7.8 million yuan, and finally slightly returned to 7.6 million yuan. In addition, the negotiated price of gold ornaments in jewelry stores rose by another 20 million yuan due to the rise in foreign exchange certificates, totaling 540 million yuan for purchases and 580 million yuan for sales.

### Inter-Bank Exchange Rate: To Be Revised Starting Tomorrow

The internal exchange rates of the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury will be revised as follows starting on the 16th: Xiamen 300 yuan, Fuzhou 250 yuan, Quanzhou and Shantou 300 yuan each, Zhangzhou 350 yuan, Changsha and Hengyang 200 yuan each, Chongqing 300 yuan, Chengdu 350 yuan, Wuhan 200 yuan each, Pingjin 10 yuan, Nanchang and Jiujiang 250 yuan each, Tunxi and Shexian 200 yuan each, Shenyang 10 yuan, Jinzhou 20 yuan, Changchun 10 yuan, Chengde 20 yuan, Zhangjiakou 30 yuan, and other places unchanged.

### The Prosperity of Woolen Fabrics

Yesterday, Saturday, the woolen fabric market was entirely prosperous. Zhang's floral woolen fabrics sold for 65 million yuan, Hongxiang's floral woolen fabrics for 60 million yuan, China Textile's 1830 serge for 42.5 million yuan, 5009 serge for 35 million yuan, 2901 overcoating fabric for 50 million yuan, and Anle Village overcoating fabric for 22.5 million yuan. Transactions occurred both directly and indirectly at gatherings and among major wholesalers in the Qipan Street area. This was largely due to the loose and ample money supply and the reduced overnight loan rates. Both local and Nanjing merchants increased their purchases, further boosted by the one-tenth increase in prices for China Textile's products on Wednesday and Friday, which strengthened confidence. Further improvements are expected.

### Bulls Unloading, Confidence Weakens: Cotton Yarn Price Increases Slightly Suppressed; Cloth Sales Strong But Prices Weaken

Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions saw hesitation due to the rapid and uncontrolled price increases. Subsequently, as credit tightened and customer interest waned, China Textile continued to sell off, increasing supply. Furthermore, due to the Saturday effect, bulls unloaded their positions. Rumors of negotiations within the market further weakened confidence.

Forty-two count Blue Phoenix fine yarn initially plummeted by 200 million yuan. Trading was not very active. Later, some weaving businesses took advantage of the lower prices to absorb some, slightly raising the price. However, it ultimately closed at 3.23 billion yuan for current delivery and 3.33 billion yuan for Monday delivery, a sharp decrease of 120 million to 70 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarns also fell by 20 to 30 million yuan, or about 10%, with 75 lots traded.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw a selling trend due to excessive price increases the day before. Moreover, with the period for the Construction Textile Company's allocation approaching, current supply was abundant. As credit tightened, customers, awaiting remittances and facing numerous maturing overnight loans, had tight cash positions. Merchants from the north resold actively, while local manufacturers remained cautious and inactive. Market supply exceeded demand.

Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened with a decrease of 1 million yuan. Subsequently, as customers from Tianjin sold off at high prices, excess inventory was pressured, leading to frequent liquidations and widespread selling in the market.

After 10:30 AM, the market fell again by 2.8 million yuan. Near the close, short covering pushed the price back up to 84.8 million yuan, a sharp drop of 3.2 million yuan compared to the previous day.

Mid-range goods such as Five Blessings Trumpet, Tong Yang Crane, etc., fell by 3 to 4 million yuan each. Apart from dyed cloth and Shilin cloth, which held steady, other varieties of cotton cloth tended to weaken. 1,760 bolts were traded.

Further News: In the afternoon session, the market selling pressure remained unabated due to tight credit caused by increased activity at the Exchange Bureau. The price of Dragon Head fine cloth would drop immediately after a slight increase. As a result, it closed flat compared to the morning close. Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge was slightly better by 50,000 yuan compared to the afternoon close, with other prices similar.

To cooperate with national policy, China Textile has adopted a policy of large-scale selling in recent days. As long as there are buyers, it will supply as much as possible, and the rising market trend has begun to be curbed. Yesterday, the Yarn Control Committee sold 238 bales of yarn on its behalf, recovering 50,997,000,000 yuan. It also allocated 144 bales on behalf of the Head Office, amounting to 28,800,000,000 yuan.

In addition, China Textile sold 13,090 pieces of cloth and 350 blankets yesterday at list prices, recovering a total of 95,733,000,000 yuan in legal tender.

### Bulls Selling Off, Chinese Stocks Plummet

Chinese stocks initially weakened and then plummeted yesterday. This was due to the imminent release of the upper period index for this month, which was predicted to be very high. There were rumors that the new economic plan would be unfavorable to the stock market, and credit tightened further. For safety's sake, the bulls all unloaded their positions, leading to a total collapse.

Yong'an Textile opened at 16,770 yuan in the morning, down 280 yuan from yesterday's opening. Confidence was scattered, and small investors had no intention of holding on, giving up en masse. Numbers 228, 69, 76, 89, and 65 were sold down to 16,550 yuan. Subsequently, numbers 220, 121, 134, and 83 showed some interest in buying, pushing the price back up to 16,950 yuan. The bulls seized the opportunity to sell off, and securities firms sold a lot. Merchants from Guangdong also came to support the selling, and the market fell again to 16,550 yuan. Although numbers 29, 43, 101, and 228 helped to maintain the price, pushing it back up to 16,700 yuan, the environment was unfavorable. Large short-sellers watched and did not move, and speculative shorts increased rather than decreased. Funds from North China decreased, and credit tightened further. Numbers 155, 116, 4, 65, 220, 106, 102, and 51 came to sell aggressively again, causing a sharp drop below the 16,000 yuan mark. Although some speculative shorts covered at lower prices, briefly pushing the price back up to 16,630 yuan, it was only a fleeting moment. Near noon, the Hong Kong exchange rate lengthened, and prices outside the market fell across the board. The already weak market could not withstand another blow. Under siege on all sides, the market became even weaker. Yong'an Textile finally closed at 15,900 yuan. Mei Ya opened at 700 yuan, reaching a high of 715 yuan and a low of 645 yuan. Xin Guang and Jingfu also tended to weaken. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yong'an Textile, Mei Ya, Xinhe, Xin Guang, Jingfu, Match, China Silk, Huadong, and Zhabei fell by more than half and about 10%. Except for Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, which rose by more than half, the rest all fell. Unlisted stocks outside the market generally held up well due to demand.

Government Bonds

Became more popular due to rumors of peace negotiations. Unified Class C opened at 2.17 million yuan. Although it once fell back to a low of 2.1 million yuan, demand exceeded supply, and Rooms 550, 503, 500, and 360 all rushed to buy, creating a new high price of 2.12 million yuan. Chengde Room 552 sold off slightly, then closed at 2.26 million yuan. As a result, Unified Class C rose sharply by 200,000 yuan, Class E rose by 250,000 yuan, and Classes A and B also rose by 60,000 yuan.

### Olympic Flame Extinguished, 14th World Games Close, USA Wins Basketball Championship

[United Press London Fourteenth Dispatch] The 14th World Games closed today. The traditional closing ceremony was held at Wembley Stadium, with an added touch of international goodwill. The five-ring World Games flag slowly descended from the flagpole, and at the same time, the World Games flame was extinguished. The World Games program will reappear in 1952 in Helsinki, the capital of Finland. Representatives and flag bearers from various countries stood in a semicircle behind the platform of honor. Military music played loudly, and flags were raised on the three flagpoles in the center of the stadium. First, the Greek flag was raised on the right, and the band played the Greek national anthem to commemorate the country of origin of the World Games. Next, the British flag was raised in the center, and the entire stadium sang "God Save the King." Finally, the Finnish flag, the host country of the next World Games, was raised on the left pole, and the Finnish national anthem was also played. The President of the International World Games Committee, Mr. Euslong, gave a speech, saying: "On behalf of the International World Games Committee, I express my respect to the King and people of England, as well as to the authorities of the City of London and the organizers of the competition. I declare that the 14th World Games has ended, and I call on the youth of the world to reunite in Helsinki in four years." After the World Games flag was lowered, it was handed over to the Mayor of London, who will hand it over to Finland in four years. The trumpeters of the King's Royal Cavalry played a farewell song, and a 5-gun salute was fired. As the choir sang the World Games song, the World Games torch was extinguished. The flag bearers also dispersed in the music. As dusk approached, the World Games stadium was empty.

[Our Newspaper Report] London 14th Broadcast: The closing ceremony of the World Games was held today. Wembley Stadium was packed with 82,000 spectators, a scene as grand as the opening ceremony. Before the closing ceremony in the afternoon, 46 equestrian athletes from 14 countries held the final event, the jumping competition. Mexico's Curtis won the championship, and the United States was second. The King of England did not attend today. Those who attended were the Duke of Edinburgh, the Duchess of Kent, Princess Alexandra, Princess Juliana of the Netherlands, etc.

[French News Agency London Fourteenth Dispatch] The formal closing ceremony of the World Games was held in the evening of the fourteenth, and the Olympic torch, which was taken from Greece and lit on July 29th, was extinguished. The athletes' achievements could not reach the expected record, mainly because of the poor weather. After several days of sudden heat, it was followed by overcast rain, and the temperature in the last few days was no different from severe winter. The most successful this time was the American World Games delegation, which did not fall behind in any sport. The scores of other countries were limited to a small number of sports, unlike the average development of the United States.

### Football Final

[Our Newspaper Report] London 14th Broadcast: 30,000 spectators at Wembley Stadium witnessed the Swedish football team defeat Yugoslavia 3-1 in an explosive battle, winning the title of World Football Champions. The大会 presented gold medals on the spot. Yugoslavia came in second and won silver medals. In another match, Denmark defeated the United Kingdom 5-3, winning the bronze medal. The United Kingdom ranked fourth.

The game was held in ideal weather. Before the game, there was a gymnastics performance by Swedish athletes. The Southern team's strategy was to use rough lines to attack the Swedish players' excellent skills. The Swedish team was indomitable and ultimately won the final victory.

In the 23rd minute of the game, Swedish center Noda volleyed a shot from 15 yards out, scoring the first goal. The Southern team counterattacked, and center Babair rushed into the net, tying the score. The first half ended in a tie. After regrouping, Noda scored another goal in the 15th minute, giving Sweden the lead for the second time. Fifteen minutes later, Noda returned with a vengeance. Just as he was about to charge straight into the dragon's lair in front of the goal, a Yugoslav defender suddenly broke out and knocked Noda down. The British referee, Mr. Lin, enforced the law impartially and awarded a penalty kick. Noda was injured, and Gran took the penalty kick, scoring in one fell swoop and securing the victory with a score of 3-1.

### The Education Bureau Convened a Symposium on Tuition Fee Issues Yesterday, Collected Opinions and Drafted a Plan, and Unanimously Demanded that Educational Funding be Increased in Accordance with the Constitution

[Our Newspaper Report] The Municipal Education Bureau held a symposium on tuition fee issues at Yucai Middle School yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. More than 100 people were invited to attend, including principals, teachers, staff, parents, and people from the education sector from public and private primary and secondary schools. The meeting was enthusiastically discussed, and the Education Bureau will summarize the opinions of all parties and formulate a specific plan for the collection of fees for public and private secondary schools in the next semester, which will be submitted to the next meeting for discussion and then reported to Mayor Wu for decision.

The Meaning of the Symposium: First, Education Bureau Director Li Ximou explained the meaning of convening the symposium, believing that the tuition fee issue for the next semester is quite serious, and hoping that attendees will abandon their prejudices when discussing and contribute their opinions while taking into account the difficulties of schools, teachers, staff, and parents. Director Li also reported that according to the Education Bureau's statistics, the fee standards for private primary schools in the previous semester were 2 million yuan, junior high schools were 3.6 million to 3.84 million yuan, and senior high schools were 4 million to 4.8 million yuan, when the cost of living index was 87,000 times. The staff index for the second half of July is now 1.5 million times. If calculated based on this cost of living index ratio, then the private elementary school should be 37 million next semester, the junior high school should be 71.4 million and the senior high school should be 89.2 million. However, this standard is calculated based on the index for the second half of July, not the index for the start of school in each school. Director Li also reported that the collection of miscellaneous fees by private schools should also be restricted, and the government will follow the British method and try to subsidize private schools with difficult economic situations.

Using Physical Objects as Standards: Jiang Wenyu believes that the fee standards can be based on physical objects, or handled with reference to the pre-war private school fee figures multiplied by the cost of living index. Tai Shuangqiu said that it is necessary to formulate a formula for fee standards, first calculate how much it should cost for a teacher's family of five to live, calculate based on 50 people per class, remove 20% for free places and 20% for administrative expenses, and calculate the teacher's salary at 3 shi of rice per month, then each student should pay about 8 dou of rice. Tai also advocated that at least one-third of the special contributions raised for relief should be used to subsidize schools in Shanghai, especially private schools.

Continuing Education Fee Issue: Representatives of municipal primary school teachers and staff requested that the teacher continuing education fee continue to be collected next semester. Representatives of private secondary school teachers and staff hoped that fees would be collected according to the price increase ratio based on the fee standards of 1936. Municipal teachers and staff believe that the fee standards for both public and private schools should be based on school expenses and the living standards of teachers, and should be borne separately by the government and students' parents. Teachers' salaries should be calculated according to the cost of living index based on the standards of the first half of 1937.

Asking the Government for Money: Legislator Chuan Tongxian first reported that the education funding in this year's national budget has been increased by more than 450 billion yuan after much effort, of which 30% is for national education funding, 30% subsidizes private schools, 30% provides relief to students in the pacification zone, and 10% subsidizes the descendants of meritorious soldiers. Therefore, local governments can legally and reasonably strive for funding from the central government. Fu believes that today there is only a way to ask the government for money to handle education affairs.

Parent Gu Shusen believes that the lives of teachers should be stable and their treatment should not be reduced due to tuition fee issues. The fee standard should also be reduced so that general parents can afford it. In addition, there was a unanimous request to increase educational funding to the amount stipulated in the Constitution.

### Private Vocational Schools' Tuition and Miscellaneous Fees for the Next Semester: 3.5 Shi of White Rice

[Our Newspaper Report] The principals of various private vocational schools in the city held a symposium at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. More than 10 people attended, including Tang Wenzhi of Wuxi National College, Pan Xulun of Lixin Accounting College, Wang Yukai of Guangxia Commercial College, Liu Haisu of Shanghai Art College, and Chen Gaoyong of China New College. It was resolved that the tuition and miscellaneous fee standards for various vocational schools in the city for the next semester will be uniformly 3.5 shi of white rice, and paid in legal tender converted according to the rice price reported on the day of the start of school. The registration deadline will be fixed and will not change. For late registration and payment, the rice price reported on the day of payment will be used for conversion.

In addition, the presidents of various private universities in the city are scheduled to meet on the 24th of this month to discuss the tuition fee issue for the next semester. It is reported that the general standard will be 4 shi of white rice.

### Representatives of Northeastern Students Petitioned the Ministry of Education Yesterday

Director Tang Promised to Find a Way to Solve Difficulties

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Fourteenth Dispatch] Nine representatives of the Northeastern Students Petition Group petitioned the Ministry of Education at 12:30 PM on the 14th regarding issues of life and study.

### Preventable Natural Disasters

— Sun Jialin

This time, the Yongbei Underwear Factory on Baoshan Road suffered a "lightning strike," which touched the motor wires, causing a major fire disaster. Of the 103 workers in the closed factory, 63 died, and more than 20 were lightly and seriously injured. The boss and the boss's wife also died. Everyone mourns in unison and sighs that it was a "bolt from the blue." In fact, half of this disaster was self-inflicted. The reason why "Heaven" wanted to "strike" the Yongbei Underwear Factory was to punish their negligence and ignorance!

Tall buildings and huge chimneys must be equipped with complete lightning rods; power lines such as motors must be equipped with ground wires; all live wires must be completely insulated, and those that are old and have exceeded their limit should be replaced; these are not very profound common sense. The architects and engineers of the factory should have paid attention to implementing them long ago. The boss came from an apprenticeship and did not receive higher education, so he may lack common sense. Their negligence and ignorance destroyed themselves and killed innocent workers!

"Natural disasters" are sometimes actually "man-made disasters" that can be prevented and mitigated. Don't be superstitious about "inevitable disasters," let alone blame "fate." If the Yongbei factory had been equipped with good lightning rods and well-insulated wires, the "lightning strike" and power outage would not have occurred. These nearly 100 lives and hundreds of billions of assets were sacrificed in vain!

A word to the managers of all factories: Prevention of accidents requires constant attention at all times; bosses should also not be too stingy with money and continue to force old wires to continue to be used. Learn from the past and be careful in the future, mend the fold after the sheep is lost, so as to avoid accidents.

### Neighborly Encounters with Jews

— Yu Jianhua

As a child, reading Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice" left me with a profound impression of the cunning and ruthlessness of Jews. Later, I heard of various vices attributed to them. Thus, an illusion formed in my mind, believing that all Jews were insidious, despicable, and solely motivated by profit.

After victory, returning to Shanghai from Fujian, I was introduced by a friend to rent a place on Changyang Road in Tilanqiao, Hongkou, an area where Jews congregated. Although many have been successively repatriated to America, there were still quite a few Jews living in the same apartment building and lane. Especially in the lane, there was a cafe and a small private garden, which were places for Jews to relax and cool off. As we got to know each other over time, I had more contact with them, and gradually felt that Jews were not as detestable as rumored. Although I had no way to know the inner layers of Jewish life, from the surface, there was nothing to criticize. Their cleanliness and health were far superior to those of the Chinese. Most people were generous and polite, and spent money quite freely. As for those who were meticulous and solely motivated by profit, they were rare.

Most of the Jews living nearby were driven out of Germany by Hitler. The men were mostly tall and well-built, with a German air (some were short, probably of a different kind). The women were mostly slender when young, but after middle age, they became extremely obese, even bloated and clumsy, with waists like five-stone urns. Both men and women dressed neatly and exquisitely, in high-quality materials. The women liked colorful clothes, and even old women with wrinkled skin and white hair still applied powder and wore colorful clothes, looking as glamorous as young women. Those who were unmarried or married without children often kept a dog, which accompanied them in and out, and was highly cherished. When they had children, the dog disappeared. Infants were always placed in exquisitely beautiful baby carriages, pushed to the garden by their father or mother, and never seen being held in arms. Jewish infants were round, fair-skinned, and like "foreign dolls," extremely cute. They gradually deteriorated as they grew older, and by the time they reached ten, their mischief exceeded that of Chinese children. Jews liked outdoor life, and very few stayed at home. Even in severe winter or hot summer, they had to go out, and even when strolling, they walked briskly, as if they had important matters. Although some of the Jews living nearby were engaged in small-scale commerce and industry, most of them were idle all day long. Although prices were high, they were content and did not feel any economic pressure. It was said that the unemployed were subsidized by the Jewish Federation, with ten US dollars per person per month, a set of clothing, and a box of food. This money was donated by American Jews, so their lives were very comfortable. There were also special ships to transport them back to America, and everything on board was free. Now more and more people are returning to America. The lane where I live was originally all Jews, but now only half remain. They mostly use German with each other, and English with the Chinese. Very few can speak Chinese. Therefore, Chinese merchants in nearby stores, small vegetable markets, and street stalls who collected old goods and repaired shoes all knew simple English and German. Whenever Jews bought things, the price was necessarily higher than for Chinese, which was taken for granted. It seems that the Chinese means of profiting are no weaker than those of the Jews. And the contempt for Jews that I had cultivated since childhood has gradually changed imperceptibly.

### Luxurious Prison

— Jin Lin

The judicial community considers the prison in Greenwich Village, New York, to be the most comfortable prison in the world, with the women's prison in particular being called a "luxurious prison" because the female prisoners there live more comfortably than the poor villagers nearby. Each cell has hot and cold water faucets, and there is a circulating library, with guards pushing carts full of novels to the cells. The prison also has a rotating altar in the chapel. During services, first the Protestant service is held, then at the push of a button, the altar rotates to the Catholic service, and with another rotation, the Jewish service. Prisoners in the prison have absolute freedom of religion.

### Anecdotes of Old Man Xu Lü

— Chen Zuogao

Time flies, prosperity and decline alternate, and it has been seven years since the Old Man Xu Yuan passed away. Every time I unfold his paintings, I think of his deeds. The old man's given name was Tongyu, his courtesy name was Shengzhi, also known as Wenruo, and Xu Yuan was his pseudonym. He was from Yuanhe, Jiangsu, and was a Hanlin scholar in the late Qing Dynasty. He was skilled in all four styles of calligraphy, especially cursive script and small regular script. His landscapes followed the styles of the Song and Yuan dynasties, with meticulous layouts, which were admired by those in the know. He first stayed at Wu Kezhai's residence, where he had a full view of ancient artifacts, calligraphy, and paintings, which he studied repeatedly for a long time. Later, he served as an official in the capital and became friends with Wu Yusheng, Ye Changchi, and Jiang Biao, discussing literature every month. In Suzhou, he, along with Kezhai, Gu Linzhi, Zheng Wenzhuo, and others, formed the Shujin Society in Yi Garden, with Old Man Xu effectively in charge. With such extensive knowledge, how could his artistic achievements not surpass those of his predecessors? It is said that Wu Hufan once saw a portrait of Nian Gengyao and said that the upper part of the old man's face closely resembled it, while the lower part resembled Zuo Zongtang. Therefore, his appearance was imposing and not at all like that of a weak scholar.

The old man also excelled in mathematics and physics. In the Jiaxu year, he served in the Surveying and Mapping Bureau, which was attached to the Manufacturing Bureau, and thus had access to insights into surveying and mechanical science. During the Sino-Japanese War in the Guangxu period, Kezhai's subordinate, General Wei Guangtao, was unable to operate the new cannons. Knowing that the old man was well-versed in this field, he invited him to take charge, and he hit the target every time, repeatedly contributing to the effort. Later, he successively held the positions of Director of Education in Jiangxi and Hubei, advocating practical learning, and many talents emerged. People like Ju Juesheng, Liu Yusheng, Dan Ming, Zhang Zhiben, and He Chengjun all came from his tutelage. During his tenure in Hubei, the famous scholar Liang Fengfen, who had impeached Li Hongzhang, was dismissed and served as the head of the Lianghu Academy for many years. His friends Zhang Zhidong and others repeatedly petitioned for his reinstatement, but to no avail. The old man then used the year-end evaluation precedent to rank Ding Fen as excellent, and was able to obtain approval for his reinstatement. His thirst for talent is evident here. After the Guihai year, he and You Xianjia founded the Suzhou Chamber of Commerce, and with Lu Yuanding, established a school, innovating politics and education everywhere, and his contributions cannot be denied. Commentators praised his innovative thinking, which was not accidental.

In the early years of the Republic of China, he chose a site near Xiancha Bridge in Nanxiang, naming his residence Cha Nan Cottage, closing his doors and sweeping the floor, and indulging in painting and calligraphy. However, he continued to cultivate younger generations, as he had done when he was Director of Education in Hubei, with particular expectations for Wu Hufan, Gu Qizhi, Yuan Anpu, and Chen Julai. To this day, they have all achieved success, demonstrating his profound vision, not like ordinary people.

When he turned eighty, his students Ju Juesheng and He Chengjun and others separately offered a birthday screen with their names jointly inscribed, along with four thousand yuan in ceremonial money, and personally toasted him, wishing him boundless longevity. He publicly declined the cash gift, remaining composed and unconcerned, demonstrating his integrity and unconventional spirit. He wrote several volumes of "Xu Yuan's Notes," "Diary," and "Collection of Poems and Essays." He also urgently gathered and recorded his works, completing any unfinished characters. Years ago, Mr. Gu Qiqian published his collection and wrote his biography, and the old man's reputation will be further spread far and wide.

### Jia Sidao's Abandoned Residence

— Shi Shufan

Jia Sidao's mansion is located north of Miaoshan in Tiantai City. The remains of the abandoned site are very extensive, with half occupied by poor households and half cultivated with millet. Local elders can still tell its story in detail. After Sidao's defeat, his entire family was ashamed and changed their surname to Ye. Therefore, there are no more Jias between Chicheng and Huading. During his lifetime, he wrote a book on crickets, which is still kept in the Ye Ancestral Hall in the western countryside, but his descendants are very secretive about it. Chen Jialin once glanced at it and said that the writing was very delicate, just like his poems. The book lists names such as "Black Head General," which are the titles bestowed on the bravest crickets. I once commented that Qiu He had some talent, but he was fond of accumulating wealth and jealous of talent, and he was in a precarious situation, so he could not avoid his fate. If he were alive today, he could travel far and wide with his wealth, and there would be no obstacles. Why would he have to die in the Kapok Nunnery? When I was stationed in that country, every time I passed Xilian, I seemed to see it and recorded my feelings.

Moss covers the abandoned foundation, and the Jiao Ma Pond is a desolate bay. "Autumn Cricket" is a good name, but how can it send the country away?

Millet grows in rows in front of the door, who says it's not the Prime Minister's residence? The moon rises over the melon shed surrounding the old man, and right and wrong still lie with the Zhao family.

How could he bear to be intimate with the deer and pigs in the deep mountains? My heart aches for my ancestors who were powerful ministers! It is proposed to seal the three volumes of the Cricket Classic, so that there are no Jias within a hundred miles.

He waved gold powder and corrupted the southeast, and died unhappily because of his dissoluteness. Floating on the sea and riding the clouds is common today, alas, he turned and turned in the Kapok Nunnery.

### The Public Sacrifice for Peace

— Shi Feng

It's the time for the public sacrifice for peace again. Although in recent decades, due to the progress of the times and the influence of new science, most people have felt that the sacrifice is boring and wasteful, and have vigorously advocated its abolition, a group of merchants and residents without new ideas and full of superstition still have boundless faith in the sacrifice, firmly believing that it can save the dead and protect the peace of the population, willing to spend countless money, stubbornly refusing to be enlightened!

A few days ago, several people came to my house with yellow booklets to raise donations, declaring that at least one million yuan should be donated. I couldn't help but be shocked. Doing other good deeds, such as donating scholarships, donating funds for mobile medical vehicles, and donating to the Pushan Villa, which are very meaningful and can actually benefit those in distress, are still done willingly, and the amount doesn't matter. I didn't expect that this "good deed" purely for ghosts and spirits would set a limit, and one must donate a certain amount, which is really absurd!

Yesterday outside the alley, a high canopy was erected, and paper clothes, paper pants, and paper ingots tied with straw ropes fluttered in the wind. Countless paper-made ghosts and monsters were erected around, and dozens of Taoist priests were noisily playing music. In the evening, there was still a constant noise of gongs and drums, making it impossible for the surrounding residents to sleep. Today it continues, and tonight a large batch of paper items will be burned. I am really worried about a fire! It is said that this time the cost will be more than 500 million (of course, the people involved will have considerable benefits). I think, if this 500 million spent on music and fire could be donated to charitable organizations or educational institutions, directly helping society, wouldn't it be much more meaningful?

Those who still believe in ghosts and monsters should have been eliminated by the times long ago. For inner peace, it is better to have some real compassion and help those poor people who are sick and have no money for treatment, and those students who are ambitious but have no way to study! And since our police authorities have the courage to remove stone statues, they should pay more attention to this behavior of collecting money under the guise of false sacrifices?

### 

The merchants and residents of old Beijing have a special kind of humor. No matter how unstable the world is, no matter how poor the circumstances, they can often show a leisurely attitude if they have not reached the final stage. The local customs and human feelings of the north are different from those of central and southern China in terms of stillness and restlessness. Even the repeated increases in the value of "paper money" and the troubles of life have turned from surprise to numbness, and from numbness to bitter laughter. The metamorphosis of the nerves can also reflect the general phenomenon.

In the market, the word "wan" (ten thousand) is omitted in transactions. For example, an item worth 300,000 is referred to as "thirty". This can be applied to other numbers. However, for numbers less than ten, such as "jiu wan" (nine ten thousand), "ba wan" (eight ten thousand), and all the way down to "yi liang wan" (one or two ten thousand), the word "wan" is still used, because a single-digit number only has one sound, which is not convenient to say. Therefore, the word "wan" is only used to complete the pronunciation. But sometimes they are called "ji ge zi er" (several zi er) or "ji ge da" (several da)! For example, those who sell sliced watermelon shout "wu ge zi er yi da kuai" (five zi er for a big slice), "san ge zi er yi xiao kuai" (three zi er for a small slice). The so-called "zi er" refers to 10,000 yuan bills or 500 Customs Gold Unit bills, borrowing from the old term "tong yuan" (copper coin)'s "zi er" (copper zi er, like what is called copper plates or copper jiaozi in the south). Similarly, those who sell bean juice, wo tou (steamed corn bread), and small snacks shout "ji ge da yi wan" (several da for a bowl), "ji ge da yi kuai" (several da for a piece), also referring to "wan". In the old cash era, one cash was called one da, which is even more quaint.

Currently, "wan" is still the unit of calculation ("qian" (thousand) has become a thing of the past, and "yi" (hundred million) is on the horizon). The face value of legal tender notes stops at 10,000 yuan, which is the largest bill in terms of legal tender, but it is becoming increasingly rare, only used for small transactions or small change. In addition to this, although so-called tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and tens of millions refer to legal tender, the actual transactions all involve "Guan Laoye" (Old Master Guan - Customs Gold Unit). (In old cities, people often called Customs Gold Units "Guan Laoye" because shops in the north were accustomed to worshiping Guan Yu as the god of wealth, with two large basins of gold ingots and silver ingots in front of his portrait, because it was popularly said that Cao Cao treated Guan Yu favorably, giving him gold when he mounted his horse and silver when he dismounted, and dramas and novels also had the "Guan Yunchang Hanging Up His Seal and Sealing Gold" episode, so "Guan Jin" (Customs Gold) was said to be "Guan Gong's Gold", which was also a fun association. As for the meaning of "Custom gold units", it is beyond the understanding of those people.)
