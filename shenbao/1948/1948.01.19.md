### Kowloon City Refugees Have Nowhere to Go; Hong Kong Government Forces Eviction Again; Guangzhou Circles to Hold Meeting Tomorrow to Discuss Countermeasures

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] In the capital, there has been little development regarding the Shameen Incident on the 18th. The British Embassy has also not lodged any protest with us regarding this incident, awaiting instructions from the British government. It is understood that regarding the Kowloon City issue, representatives from both sides in London have been in constant contact for the past four days, and reports have been sent to the capital frequently. As for the Shameen Incident, both sides have remained silent. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has a clear understanding of the entire incident but has not yet received detailed instructions or reports on the interrogation of the arrested perpetrators.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] In light of the unfortunate incidents caused by student and public demonstrations in Guangzhou, the Ministry of Education issued a circular on the 17th to education bureaus in all provinces and cities, and all colleges and universities across the country, to explain the progress of negotiations regarding the Kowloon City incident. It is hoped that all bureau chiefs and school principals will earnestly persuade students to remain calm and await a reasonable solution from the government, and that they will refrain from any excessive actions that could be exploited by evildoers, thereby exacerbating diplomatic difficulties.

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 18th] The Hong Kong side recently issued another order, demanding that all refugees stranded in Kowloon City be evacuated by the 19th. This has once again triggered a surge of reaction in this area. The Kowloon City Incident Relief Association, organized by various sectors, held its third meeting on the 18th and decided to wait for a report on the Kowloon City situation on the 19th, then hold a general meeting on the 20th to take countermeasures. According to the heads of the local machine workers' union and the seamen's union, if the situation in Kowloon City deteriorates, a large-scale strike will be launched immediately. The seamen's union also announced that it could immediately cease all work within half an hour, resulting in the suspension of all ferry services between Guangdong and Hong Kong, and goods would be unable to be unloaded. It is anticipated that Hong Kong seamen will also take the same action. Also, although today is Sunday, the leaders of the province and city have been working all day to handle the Shameen Incident. More than 140 suspects have been arrested and have begun interrogation. Martial law has been lifted in Shameen, but it is still heavily guarded by military police. It is feared that the situation may worsen again due to the Hong Kong side's forced eviction of Kowloon City residents.

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 18th] The Chinese national flag continues to fly today in the old city area of Kowloon. Evicted residents have built many small tents for shelter and established two military-use tent areas as their headquarters and to store food. The police have not interfered and do not intend to interfere. Currently, only one Chinese passenger ship and two cargo ships are operating in the Pearl River. Taikoo ships suspended operations after the Guangzhou incident, but the Hong Kong Airlines Guangzhou flights are still operating as scheduled.

[Our Dongqing Dispatch, 18th] The Chongqing Police Department today notified all consulates that foreigners are strictly prohibited from going out if students march to protest the Kowloon City incident, to avoid accidents.

### Wuhan Students March to Protect Rights, Calling for Internal Stability and External Resistance to Aggression

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 18th] More than 200 representatives from China University, National College of Physical Education, Provincial Agricultural College, and various middle schools in this area marched in three trucks at 10:00 AM on the 18th to protest the Kowloon City incident. They first broadcast propaganda in the Wuchang urban area, shouting slogans such as "Seek internal stability, resist external aggression." At 1:30 PM, they crossed the river and marched with five trucks in the downtown area of Hankou, maintaining good order. The military and police authorities also sent personnel to protect British-owned companies and the British Consulate. At 3:30 PM, the representatives visited Director Cheng to present their petitions, and at 4:00 PM, they met with reporters to explain the reasons for requesting the government to recover Hong Kong.

[United Press, Hankou, 18th] More than 300 students in this area held an anti-British demonstration this afternoon but were unable to reach their destinationâ€”the British Consulate. Plainclothes officers guarded the consulate all day. When the student contingent arrived at the Yangtze River port from Wuchang at 2:00 PM this afternoon, they were turned back by the police.

British and American consulate personnel watched from the rooftops and were later persuaded by the police to go inside to avoid provoking public anger.

British Consul Stocks stayed in the consulate all day, but the British flag was not hoisted on the consulate's roof. The atmosphere in the city is still calm, as the police department learned of the students' plans to march today and immediately took necessary measures to prevent a repeat of the Guangzhou tragedy.

[Our Zhengzhou Dispatch, 18th] The Jiangsu College and Middle School Federation in this city today resolved to telegraph the government, urging it to resist Britain strongly and recover Hong Kong and Kowloon.

### Statement by Guangzhou Student Union Council Member on the Shameen Incident

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th] Qu Changcheng, Standing Director and Secretary of the City Student Union, made the following comments on the burning of the British Consulate on the 18th: "The Union led students from various schools to participate in the city's demonstration marches, purely out of patriotic enthusiasm. It is regrettable that the burning of the British Consulate occurred on that day. Afterwards, some people in the community mistakenly believed that it was done by the students, which was due to a lack of understanding of the facts. An investigation found that the students participating in the march announced the dispersal of the team after arriving at Shameen and shouting slogans, and students from various schools also left one after another. The burning was actually arson committed by conspirators taking advantage of the crowd's anger. At that time, Standing Director Li Naiwan and I were mostly on the scene persuading students to disperse and maintaining order, and protecting British residents such as Mr. Williams to return to the consulate. Most of the arrested students were maintaining order on the scene and were mistakenly arrested. Many have been interrogated and released in recent days. For those who have not yet been interrogated, I am determined to go to various security agencies on the 19th to request bail. Regarding the Kowloon incident, we will continue to maintain our previous attitude and vow to be the government's backing, striving for a reasonable resolution of this matter."

### British Newspapers Report on Shameen Incident, Only Facts, No Comments

[Central News Agency, London, 17th] All London newspapers today carried reports of the Guangzhou unrest, but without comment. The reports presented the course of events in a very objective manner, and especially mentioned the origin of the dispute. Most newspapers mentioned the efforts made by the National Government to stop the unrest, and Premier Zhang Qun's order to Guangdong provincial government officials to take measures to prevent the continued occurrence of anti-British demonstrations. The Times also reported in detail the views of our officials stationed in London on this incident. They expressed regret over the occurrence of the incident and said that the Chinese government had repeatedly urged the Hong Kong government to handle the issue of Chinese residents in Kowloon City with tact and restraint, fearing that any strong actions by Britain might be used by certain extremist elements as an excuse to incite anti-British and anti-government unrest. The British Foreign Office invited our ambassador to the UK, Zheng Tiansi, to discuss the matter last night, and Zheng expressed the same view.

### Zhenjiang Prepares for Legislative Yuan Elections; Jiangxi Election Office Requests Flexible Handling of Legislative Yuan Ballot Book Delivery Issue

[Our Qianjiang Dispatch, 18th] The Zhenjiang Legislative Yuan election is scheduled to be held simultaneously in various townships on the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd. The 163 members of the Zhenjiang County Reporters Association are designated to vote in Shuangjing Township. According to general estimates, Chen Guangfu is the most promising candidate for the Zhenjiang County Legislative Yuan election.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Regarding the issue of delivering Legislative Yuan ballot books, the Jiangxi Provincial Election Office reported to the General Election Office here that it had adopted an expedient handling method and requested approval for record-keeping. It is claimed that the ballot books are actually replaced by voter lists, and the voter lists for the Legislative Yuan election in counties and cities are originally based on the National Assembly representative voter lists. If, after being replaced by the ballot books, they must be delivered to the district election office, then the counties and cities will not even have a basis for the National Assembly representative voter lists. If the district election office sends voter lists to various counties and cities to replace the ballot books, it will not only be difficult to mail back and forth, but also time will not allow it. It is now specifically stipulated that the Legislative Yuan election ballot books will be allowed to be replaced by the voter lists originally stored in the counties and cities, which will still be kept by the counties and cities. However, after the voting is completed, the counties and cities must, in accordance with regulations, separately list the matters that should be recorded on the ballot books and report them to the district election office for verification as a remedy. This is reported for your inspection and record-keeping. The General Election Office's 18th Election Committee resolved yesterday to approve the record-keeping.

### Elected National Assembly Representatives Sign, Firmly Oppose Paired Elections

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Kuomintang National Assembly Representatives Signing and Nominating Elected Candidates Friendship Association held a meeting at 9:00 AM on the 18th to continue discussing the issue of party members withdrawing their candidacies.

The following is the amended article:

Amended Article 4 of the Measures for the Collection and Manufacturing of Gold Jewelry by Silver Shops: The price of gold jewelry sold by silver shops shall be based on the gold price announced by the Central Bank, plus an operating fee of 40% and a legal profit of 20%.

### Implementation of Sino-Hong Kong Anti-Smuggling Agreement Postponed to February 1st

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 18th] It is understood that the Sino-Hong Kong anti-smuggling agreement, originally scheduled to be implemented on the 20th, may be postponed to February 1st due to the lack of preparation.

If time permits, they also plan to visit the Joint Treasury and the Ministry of Finance to discuss related matters. In the afternoon of the 20th, they will again consult with the Ministry of Food on various specific issues. It is reliably learned that Premier Zhang Qun is very concerned about the North and will convene relevant institutions such as economy, finance, food, and finance, as well as petition representatives, in the near future to hold extensive consultations in order to have a comprehensive and feasible solution to the severe economic situation in the North.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Agrees to Loan to Aid Yunnan Province Industry

### Five Cities to Expand Food Rationing; Food Source Problem Resolved; Rationing Committee to be Established with the Mayor as the Ex Officio Chairman

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] After the principle of expanding food rationing in five major cities was passed by the Price Committee of the All-Economic Conference, Food Minister Yu Feipeng immediately ordered his subordinates to conduct a thorough investigation of food sources and draft detailed implementation measures. It is now understood that the food source problem has been largely resolved, and the Ministry of Food is drafting measures for the amount of rationed food, the price of rationed food, and ration purchase certificates, which can be completed within a week and implemented after approval by the Executive Yuan. At the same time, it has been decided to establish rationing committees in the five major cities to manage the rationing, with the mayor as the ex officio chairman, and the committee will be staffed by one commissioner or counselor sent by the Ministry of Food as one of the standing committee members. The remaining members will include one person sent by the Relief Supplies Handling Committee and representatives from relevant agencies of the municipal government, totaling seven people. In addition, the rumor that the rationing price will be two dou for large families and one dou for small families refers to the rationing of rice for poor households, while the amount for civil servants and teachers is still under discussion.

### Our US Loan Plan; Zhang Jia'ao in Nanjing Collecting Data; Divided into Two Departments: Currency Reform and Economic Construction

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] As the new US aid to China bill is about to be submitted, our country's plan to use US loans, in addition to the part already taken by the technical delegation sent by our country to the United States, led by Bei Zuyi and others, is still missing a lot of data due to Bei's hasty departure. Zhang Jia'ao is now responsible for collecting it. Zhang, who arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai three days ago, has been in frequent contact with relevant agencies in recent days and is busy collecting data. Several senior officials from the Central Bank are also assisting Zhang in his duties. The data collected by Zhang can be divided into two major departments: one is data on currency reform, and the other is data on economic construction. The latter includes various departments such as transportation, water conservancy, agriculture and forestry, and industrial mining, with a very wide scope. After arriving in the United States, Bei also sent a telegram to Zhang, saying that the data he brought was not sufficient and requested that he continue to collect and send it to the United States. Zhang plans to stay in Nanjing for two more days and return to Shanghai on the 20th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] A Shanghai newspaper reported that Zhang Jia'ao will become the Minister of Finance. According to people close to Zhang on the 18th, this news is absolutely incorrect. Zhang's visit is purely to collect data on our country's plan to use US loans. The rumor that he is discussing the resumption of industrial and commercial loans with the authorities is also incorrect.

### Unrest in Fujian Waters; Naval Headquarters Sends Warships to Patrol; Land-Based Bandits Also Rampant

On the 17th of this month, the headquarters sent a large 4,000-ton warship, the "Zhonglian," which arrived in Xiamen from Shantou. Captain Lin Pu, a lieutenant colonel, went ashore this morning to visit the Naval Patrol Office and discussed the coastal security issues in detail.

[Another Dispatch] Guanqiao Town in Tongan County (near Xiamen) was suddenly infiltrated by more than 200 armed bandits on the morning of the 17th.

In addition, the National Army on both sides of the Beiping-Ningyuan railway launched a mop-up operation. There are no more traces of bandits near Changli. It is also rumored that Mao Zedong recently presided over a meeting of the CCP Central Committee in Xingxian.

[Another Dispatch] The Communist bandit Li Yunchang's troops, numbering 4,000, crossed the Pingjin railway at Weishanzhuang, causing minor damage to the station and railway. After being met by the National Army, they fled southeast. Pingjin trains were delayed for three hours.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 18th] A large force of bandits is gathering again around Baoding. The main force of its Sixth Column moved from Tangxian Wangdu to Sanyucun, Sandianzhuang, Jiacun, and other areas in Mancheng on the morning of the 16th, and transported a large number of landmines, which were laid in the area north and east of Mancheng for several consecutive days, claiming that they would again attack the northwest stronghold of Baoding. In addition, the main force of the remnant Fourth Column arrived in Shangxiazikou in the northwest of Mancheng, and its Eleventh Brigade has crossed the upper reaches of the Caohe River to Wenjiatun Daokou and other places east of Mancheng.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Deng County battle, which has continued for ten days, has changed due to the attacking troops responding in concert with the reinforcements. On the 18th, the National Army completed the outlying operations and struck the invading bandits.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 18th] More than 15,000 wounded soldiers from Chen Yi's bandit troops in eastern Henan were transported from north of Qixian across the Longhai Road to western Shandong yesterday.

Chen's bandits have been surrounded north of the Huai River and east of the Pinghan Road, and the attempt to transport ammunition to the bandits has been crushed.

### Various Banks and Bureaus Respond to the Joint Treasury; All Advocate Opening Credit; However, Scope is Narrowed and Strictly Restricted

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Regarding the issue of whether or not to open credit, the Joint Treasury previously solicited opinions from various banks and bureaus. It has now received replies from the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, the Postal Savings Bureau, and the Cooperative Treasury. All advocate opening credit and have submitted this year's credit plans, but they advocate that after the credit is opened, the scope of credit should be narrowed and strictly restricted. It is also learned that the Joint Treasury is also studying the new credit plan for this year. This new plan is not a new method, but only a modification of the existing "Investment and Discount Policy" and "Revised Discount Principles." In the past, the scope of credit was wider, but it will be tightened in the future, and will be limited to six daily necessities and nine items such as transportation and public utilities exports. The credit interest rate will also be carefully studied. The purpose of the Joint Treasury's credit is to maintain production at a low interest rate, which has its advantages, but low interest rates can easily lead to hoarding. The method of ordering goods for credit is also under study, but Chairman Jiang once issued a handwritten instruction that credit should not be opened before the Lantern Festival, so there is no hope of opening it before the Lantern Festival.

### Wei Lihuang to Immediately Fly to Shenyang to Assume New Post; Chairman Held Banquet Yesterday Afternoon to Instruct on Important Matters; Northeast Bandit Troops Gathering and Plotting to Make Trouble Again

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Chairman Chiang held a banquet at his official residence at 1 p.m. on the 18th for Wei Lihuang and his wife. Around 9 p.m., Wei met with the Chairman again to request instructions on matters related to bandit suppression in the Northeast. Wei is currently actively preparing to go to Shenyang to assume his new post. Chairman Chiang ordered him to fly to Shenyang on the 19th, but Wei believes that there are still important official matters to be dealt with in Nanjing and that he needs to collect information on the bandit situation in the Northeast, so he will not be able to depart until the 21st at the earliest. On the afternoon of the 18th, Liu Shiyi visited Wei, and at 9:30 p.m., Zhang Zhizhong also visited Wei for a long talk. Furthermore, the selection of the deputy commander-in-chief and chief of staff for bandit suppression in the Northeast will be announced after Wei arrives in Shenyang. Although Chen Cheng has decided to return to Nanjing for rest, the date of his return has not yet been determined.

[Our Newspaper, Pan Yang, 18th] Chen Cheng said on the 18th: The establishment of a bandit suppression headquarters in the Northeast can demonstrate the central government's determination to suppress bandits. Wei, concurrently commander-in-chief, has a glorious history in the revolution and the War of Resistance, and he can certainly shoulder the heavy responsibility. In the future, I will devote myself to the political and economic problems of the Northeast to cooperate with the military and complete the bandit suppression task.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 18th] The National Army, supported by local forces, launched another attack on Beizhen, inflicting blows on the bandits.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 18th] It is reported from Nanjing on the 18th that 300,000 communist bandits are gathered around Shenyang, and a decisive battle in the Northeast is expected to begin within a few days. The US Consul General in Pan Yang, Walter, was summoned by the State Department and left Pan Yang yesterday to return to the country (Walter arrived in Peiping on the 18th) to present a report on the situation in the Northeast to the State Department in person, which further proves the seriousness of the situation. In addition, the appointment of General Wei Lihuang as the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in the Northeast, the landing of General Fan Hanjie's mechanized units from Qingdao on the northern coast of Sha, and the active deployment of the National Army's air force all indicate that the Northeast war situation is approaching a decisive stage. It is learned that air force squadrons have been moved from bases in North China and elsewhere to locations closer to the front lines in the Northeast. Furthermore, after the establishment of the Northeast Bandit Suppression Headquarters, the Northeast will be divided into nine pacification zones, each with a commander.

[United Press, Qingyang, 18th] The situation in this area near here today is calm, with only scattered skirmishes. It is widely believed that the communist bandits are regrouping and attempting to make a comeback. The main concern of the National Army at present is to open up railway traffic with the Chinese mainland to launch the most effective counter-offensive against the communist economic war.

[United Press, Peiping, 18th] A telegram from Pan Yang states that five groups of bandits in southern Liaoning are ready to move, while other teams are moving south to join bandit units near central Liaoning. Communist bandits have also secretly crossed the Liao River on the northern bank, and major battles are about to occur on the northern, eastern, and southern sides of Shenyang.

### Editorial: The People Must Survive, the Nation Must Become Strong! The Significance of the General Mobilization for Suppressing Rebellion and Building the Nation

Yesterday, various circles in Shanghai held a mobilization meeting for suppressing rebellion and building the nation. Representatives of refugees from bandit areas in northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and Shandong successively recounted their bitter and cruel experiences, deeply moving the three to four thousand attendees. Speaker Pan said, "Our decline in international status and the loss of opportunities for recuperation after the war are all the crimes of the communist bandits." Mayor Wu said, "If the communist bandits are not eliminated, China will perish. If the communist bandits are eliminated, China will become strong." Committee Member Fang of the Kuomintang said, "Without suppressing the communist bandits, we cannot build the nation." Youth Party representative Xiao Bingxing then said, "Only by suppressing rebellion and banditry can we restore the countryside, increase production, ensure that everyone has food to eat, and everyone has clothes to wear." What is the reason for their unanimous call?

Simply put, it is two sentences: For the people to survive and for the nation to become strong!

For these two points alone, we must suppress rebellion with all our strength, and we must build the nation with all our strength.

Originally, we had endured eight long years of hardship in the War of Resistance against Japan, shedding blood and sweat, contributing money and effort. Under the leadership of our wise leader and fighting alongside our allies, we finally won the victory and made the tyrannical enemy surrender. Our people should have been able to breathe a sigh of relief and live a good life. Our country had also abolished unequal treaties with foreign powers and joined the ranks of the world's four or five strongest nations. With continued efforts, it should have naturally become strong. But what is the situation today?

Prices are rising day by day, life is becoming more and more difficult. Not only is the situation before the war now just a beautiful dream, but even the hardships at the beginning of the victory are now almost unattainable. We all feel the heavy burden of living expenses, we all see the increase in the unemployed population, and we are all gradually about to cry out for help, saying that we cannot survive! But we must think carefully, to whom do we owe this? If there were no communist bandits selling out the interests of the nation and stirring up chaos, we would certainly be able to build peacefully, increase production, expand the fruits of victory, and raise the standard of living. How could we have become increasingly difficult, year after year, and feel that we are about to be unable to survive? Try closing your eyes and thinking: In the past two years, how many miles of railways have been destroyed by the communist bandits? How many mines have been destroyed? How many acres of farmland have been abandoned? How many lives have been slaughtered and destroyed? How many properties have been burned, looted, and plundered? All of these, the source of our people's livelihood, will be exhausted due to the long-term destruction by the brutal communist bandits. How can the people not be poor, and how can they not lament that they cannot survive? Fellow compatriots in Shanghai, fellow compatriots in the non-pacification areas of the rear, everyone should recognize two points: 1. The reason why our people today feel that they cannot survive is all due to the rampant rebellion of the communist bandits. 2. If we are not vigilant today and do not quickly rise up, enduring the pain for a while, contributing all our manpower and resources to support the government in suppressing the bandits and quelling the rebellion as soon as possible, then we may not be able to attain the living standards we have today in the future, and we may even suffer the same fate as our compatriots in the bandit areas today!

Today, we can hear the painful cries of hunger and cold from the mouths of refugees from the bandit areas. We can see the brutal outlines of murder and torture on the faces of refugees from the bandit areas. They cannot till the land, they cannot work, they cannot read books, they cannot protect their property, they cannot keep their homes, and they cannot even live their lives. They are struggled against, purged, framed, and massacred. Under severe punishments, they are even forced to watch their sons kill their fathers, brothers kill their brothers, husbands and wives become enemies, and friends become foes. Acts that destroy humanity and undermine ethics are commonplace. Although the communist bandits call for land reform or class struggle, trying to deceive the peasants and laborers, the communist bandits' ultimate goal is to seize all means of production by using murderous and arsonist violence. Therefore, they must kill all owners of the means of production for their own pleasure. As a result, peasants who originally obtained land by liquidating landlords may be liquidated in a blink of an eye, and shop assistants who originally seized stores by struggling against shopkeepers may be struggled against in a blink of an eye. At the extreme end of liquidation and struggle, they will inevitably force the people to die. Those who oppose the communist bandits cannot survive in the bandit areas, and those who think that they do not care about politics and have no conflict with the bandits can never survive. Even the ignorant masses who blindly follow the communist bandits and are coerced by them, or the intellectuals who echo the communist bandits and promote them, can never survive in the end. Everyone is constantly worried and does not know which day they will lose their lives. Even breathing has almost lost its freedom, so what is the meaning of "living"? Today, the Taiyuan telegram in this newspaper states that Yan Xishan said that the communist bandits are currently strictly purging the party, forcing cadres to "join the army" (i.e., become soldiers), disbanding schools, forcing students to join the army, reducing food rations, and driving farmers to the battlefield. All of these are enough to prove that the compatriots in the bandit areas are all in a pitiful state of being persecuted and sacrificed. One day, they will not be able to survive even if they want to, and they are truly suffering the pain of not being able to survive! To save ourselves, to save our compatriots, and to enable the people to survive, there is no other way today but to be of one heart and one mind, contribute money and effort, and mobilize everything we have to suppress the bandits and quell the rebellion.

Furthermore, during the War of Resistance against Japan, our country's position at the Cairo Conference and its position when the United Nations was first established, its independent and autonomous dignity, and its glorious appearance as a great power made everyone feel honored. Given a few years of peaceful construction, national prosperity, and a strong nation, which country would dare to insult us again? Unfortunately, the communist bandits are prone to foreign flattery, and selling out the country is their duty. They spare no effort in harassing and destroying. As a result, our international status has declined. The defeated Japan is gradually rising, and the main culprit, Tojo, is actually brazenly defending his crimes. The Allied Soviet Union has exceeded the scope of its one-sided coercion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, occupying Lushun and Dalian, cutting off the Northeast, and supporting the communist bandit rebellion for its own pleasure. And the United Kingdom, with whom we once suffered together and fought side by side in India and Myanmar, now has the Hong Kong government allowing the police to stage violent acts of demolishing residences in Kowloon City and shooting Chinese people, taking it lightly and not feeling strange. We try to think, in less than two years, why has our country's international status declined so much! If the communist bandits are not eliminated for one day, and the great chaos is not put down for one day, then the country will not be able to embark on the road to prosperity and strength for one day, and the Chinese people will not be able to hold their heads up for one day.

The Chinese people are indeed peace-loving people, and China is by no means an aggressive country. However, in this turbulent world situation, if China wants to gain a foothold in the future, it must lay a solid foundation for prosperity and strength within three to five years. If China misses the great opportunity to strengthen itself after the Second World War, then not only will incidents like the residents of Kowloon City being humiliated and Lushun and Dalian being forcibly occupied by neighboring countries continue to occur, but there may also be even greater events. Even a full-scale invasion of external violence, such as the September 18th Incident and the July 7th Incident, who knows which day it may be added to our heads. We should really wake up quickly! Without self-improvement, there is only destruction! However, if the communist bandits are not eliminated, and the disturbance is endless, how can China become strong? Therefore, if we want to make the country strong, we must endure all hardships and use all our strength to suppress and eliminate the communist bandits as soon as possible.

The city of Shanghai is full of patriotic and people-loving people, and they are naturally enthusiastic about saving refugees and saving the motherland, hoping that the people can live and the country can become strong. But at the same time, Shanghai is also full of soulless people. The fire has already burned their eyebrows, but they are still indulging in extravagance and decadence, living a life of stolen pleasure! We must call on these soulless people to wake up! To enable the people to live and to make the country strong, we must quickly mobilize and build the nation to quell the rebellion!

The words are: Alas, the towering Zhang Gong, a pioneer of the country, revived in Japan, nurtured great integrity, and experienced many dangers. Having eliminated the Qing Dynasty, he became the director of the Senate, preventing gradual extinction. The great robber moved the country, deeply worried and treading on a tiger, with far-sighted and high strategies, he was truly a chief planner. Recreating the universe, the nine prefectures were at peace. Roaming north and south, saving the dying and healing the wounded, the bandits rose up, yet breathing was still possible. Suppressing rebellion and building the nation, truly relying on the ultimate plan, unyielding and unbending, repeatedly establishing great achievements. The War of Resistance was victorious, but there was no small rest. Deliberating and anticipating, holding three times and spitting three times, looking around anxiously, diligently sighing.

### Yan Xishan Discusses Four Signs Proving that Communist Bandits Will Take Cruel and Blind Actions

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 18th] "There are now four signs proving that the communist bandits believe that the prolonged war is unfavorable to them and that they will break the pot and make a desperate gamble this year, taking cruel and blind actions." This is the conclusion made by Yan Xishan, director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, when analyzing the communist bandit rebellion. Yan said: The communist bandits have reached the end of their rope and are making a final struggle before their demise. There are four signs that can illustrate this phenomenon: 1. Strict party cleansing, all cadres, officers, and soldiers of peasant origin are being purged to avoid wavering when the final decisive battle is fought; 2. Forcing cadres to join the army, most of the administrative work has been stopped. If he is not preparing for a decisive battle, he would not do so, nor is it necessary; 3. Disbanding schools, forcing all the young students who have been lured to join the army, and reorganizing land and reforming accounting and struggle work groups; 4. Reducing food rations, not making long-term plans to increase production, but driving farmers to the battlefield. Yan further pointed out that the communist bandits' cruelty is not a matter of the "human nature" of communist members, but under the erroneous viewpoint of communism, cruel killing is necessary and permanent, because the principle of communism is to seize the means of production by violence, not to peacefully transform and reform the old system, and it is inevitable to kill all owners of the means of production. Also, because communism uses power to collect all products and distributes the products itself, it will inevitably eliminate laborers who are unwilling to be its cattle and horses. Therefore, farmers who have been liquidated and have gained land are liquidated again in no time. In this way, the communist bandits' killing is like cutting grass, and it will never end. Therefore, we must recognize the communist bandits' faces, mobilize all our strength, and quell the bandit rebellion.

### Six Locations Including Shanghai and Hankou to Establish Hospitality Centers for Troops in Transit

They will also mobilize social organizations in those locations to jointly carry out hospitality and support work. According to Guo Chan, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Service Forces, who told reporters: "The work of hospitality for troops in transit was initiated by Madame Chiang, and it is now gradually receiving assistance from all sectors of society. This type of work is a good foundation for promoting cooperation between the military and the people, and it is necessary to rely on enthusiastic support from all sectors to achieve good results. Currently, the establishment and operating expenses of various hospitality centers are borne by the Combined Service Headquarters. As for the enrichment of support work and various recreational and welfare facilities, we earnestly hope for donations from all sectors, so that this new institution can quickly fulfill its mission."

### Security Council Recommends India and Pakistan to Peacefully Resolve Dispute; Assists Both Sides in Finding a Common Solution

[Reuters, Lake Success, 17th] The representatives of India and Pakistan attending the United Nations Security Council to participate in the Kashmir case debate agreed today to the British proposal that the chairmen of the Indian and Pakistani delegations hold talks on the weekend, chaired by the President of the Security Council, to seek a common ground for resolving the Kashmir issue. Prior to the establishment of the agreement to hold the aforementioned talks, Pakistani Foreign Minister Sir Muhammad Zafrulla Khan delivered a long speech, pointing out that India intends to occupy Kashmir for a long time, and that Pakistan had suggested a friendly solution to India seven times, but was rejected by the Indian side. In the whipping and meeting with Indian ã€€ Mountbatten, Pakistan suggested an immediate halt to all combat doors, and that external pen teams should withdraw from Kashmir, and that a referendum should be held under joint supervision. After denying India's accusations against Pakistan, ã€€ said: Anyone entering Kashmir, including the Indian army, must withdraw, and the war must be stopped so that normal administration can be restored. Pressure should not be applied to the people of Kashmir, and we should abide by the resolution established by the people of Kashmir. The Security Council then passed a resolution proposed by Chairman Quackenhoff with nine votes to zero (the Soviet Union and Ukraine ã€€rights), asking the Indian and Pakistani governments to take all measures immediately to improve the situation, and not to have any remarks or measures that would further worsen the situation. . [Central News Agency, Lake Success, 17th, United Press] The United Nations Security Council had previously heard the Pakistani representative conclude its emergency call. ã€€. United Press believed that the United Nations would recommend the establishment of a fine machine for conciliation between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir dispute. Both sides agree to hold a referendum in the disputed state.

### Gandhi Ends Fast; Indian Religious Leaders Establish Agreement Guaranteeing Compliance with Seven Conditions for Peace

[Associated Press, New Delhi, 18th] Indian spiritual leader Gandhi ended his fast at 12:45 PM today (3:15 PM Shanghai time), while Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim leaders signed an agreement guaranteeing compliance with the peace plan proposed by Gandhi to maintain the safety of minorities.

Gandhi sat upright on the couch, drinking a small glass of sweet lemon juice. He had been fasting for 121 hours and 45 minutes and seemed satisfied with the pledge of peace between the various religions. Congress Chairman Prasad announced the matter to a crowded room in Birla House. Gandhi smiled silently. The people declared, "Gandhi has now ended his fast and trusts us. The responsibility lies entirely with us, and we must act in accordance with his trust." The news that Gandhi had begun to eat was first spread by his grandniece and girl. As she burst down to announce the news to the waiting reporters in Hindi, she was even tearful with joy.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 17th] Governor-General Mountbatten, who had just returned from Bikaner State, visited Gandhi's bedside with his wife tonight and left after about 20 minutes. Gandhi's fast has entered its fifth day, and doctors have announced that his health is definitely getting weaker. Thousands of peace-loving people surround Birla House, where Gandhi lives, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru has personally gone to address them. Gandhi wrote on his sickbed a speech to be delivered at the prayer meeting, including the words "I am practically lying on my deathbed". Indian Education Minister Aruna Asaf Ali revealed to the crowd of 50,000 people attending the peace conference the seven conditions for Gandhi to end his fast, saying that Gandhi could resume eating after receiving a satisfactory guarantee on the following points: ã€€The annual race meeting to be held near Bahat , Delhi, where the Muslim shrine is located, must be held as scheduled, and Hindus should ensure that Muslims can participate freely. ã€€The 117 mosques in the Delhi area that were converted into temples or residences after the great riots last September should be restored to mosques by non-Muslims without government ã€€force. ã€€Muslims should be able to travel freely in the ã€€Delhi area. ã€€Non-Muslims in Delhi should not oppose Muslims returning to Delhi from Pakistan. ã€€Muslims traveling by train should not be at risk of loss of life or property. ã€€Economic boycotts should not be imposed on Muslims. ã€€The resettlement of Hindus in Muslim areas is handled by Muslims.

### Indian and Dutch Leaders Review Ceasefire Implementation Methods

[Our Newspaper] London, 18th Broadcast: Batavia News, The United Nations Mediation Commission announced today that the Commission will send a military adviser to the war zone in the middle of this week to discuss the implementation of the ceasefire with the commanders of both India and the Netherlands. Today, Indian and Dutch leaders met in Daweia to review the actual situation and will continue their discussions tomorrow.

[Reuters, Batavia, 18th] Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir Hatta said in a speech at the lunch celebrating the establishment of the ceasefire agreement today that the ceasefire agreement here is far from what the Republic of Indonesia originally expected and is of course disappointing, but since the Republic has accepted it, it should implement the ceasefire agreement with the understanding that "political negotiations will begin based on the recommendations of the United Nations Mediation Committee".

### United Nations Commission on Korea Establishes Two Subcommittees

[Reuters, Lake Success, 17th] The United Nations Commission in Korea has decided to establish a subcommittee to study how to create a free environment for elections in Korea. The Commission held its fifth meeting in Seoul yesterday and decided to establish a subcommittee to review documents received from the Korean side and to hear meetings with Korean personnel. The aforementioned first subcommittee is organized by Canada, France, and Syria, and the latter subcommittee is organized by China, France, Australia, Africa, and the Philippines.

### British Foreign Policy to Undergo Fundamental Change

[Central News Agency, London, 17th] It is reported that Bevin will make an important statement in the House of Commons on the 22nd. At that time, he will launch a two-day debate on foreign policy to review the international political issues of the failure of the foreign ministers' meeting. It is even speculated that the Foreign Secretary's statement will reveal a fundamental change in British government policy. Attlee and Morrison have already made candid remarks on the Soviet Union, and this issue will undoubtedly be mentioned by the Foreign Secretary.

### US Foreign Aid Should Include Asia and the Far East - UN Philippine Representative Delivers Speech

[United Press, New York, 17th] Carlos P. Romulo, the chief representative of the Philippine delegation to the United Nations, received the 1947 World Statesman Gold Medal of Honor from the International Franklin Society here today. In his speech, he stated that U.S. foreign aid must include Asia and the Far East to ensure peace and maintain America's credibility. At this critical juncture in the world situation, the United States needs friendship, and the 1.2 billion people of Asia and the Far East also need the friendship of the United States. We are currently facing a crisis in thought and power, with the American way of life on one side and theories contrary to democracy on the other. The Filipino people are determined to see the American way of life not only endure forever but also prevail supreme.

### The Marshall Plan Is a Weapon to Combat the Soviets - Dulles Delivers Speech in New York

[United Press, New York, 17th] Republican foreign policy spokesman John Foster Dulles stated that the United States must use food and creative ideas to combat the Soviet Union's weapons of "propaganda and sabotage" throughout the world. Dulles, a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly and advisor to Marshall during the recent Four-Power Conference, said at a luncheon of the New York Foreign Policy Association on the 17th that the Marshall Plan is the most powerful weapon against aggression for the United States. It is claimed that at the end of the war, Soviet leaders considered us enemies rather than friends. The Soviet Union adopted this strategy because Moscow is the "supreme authority of the Soviet Communist Party" and will carry out ideological struggles throughout the world. He also stated that the Soviet Union's weapons for global hegemony are "propaganda techniques" and strikes and sabotage. The United States must use food, fuel, and creative ideas and ideals to achieve peace. The first stage of achieving peace ended with the breakdown of the recent Council of Foreign Ministers meeting; the second stage has shown the battle between East and West to be escalating. If the United States' plan to counter Communist sabotage fails, the losses will be immeasurable.

### US Relief Supplies Arrive in France in Large Quantities

[Reuters, Paris, 17th] U.S. Ambassador to France, Jefferson Caffery, told the American Chamber of Commerce here today that relief supplies under the U.S. emergency aid to France, worth $53 million, arrived in France in the 24 days up to January 10th, including 115,000 tons of coal, 140,000 tons of grain, 200,000 tons of gasoline, and 28,000 tons of fertilizer, chemicals, and raw cotton. Caffery also said that the United States considers France to be the key to the reconstruction of Western Europe.

### US Sends Fleet to the Mediterranean, Scale Similar to Wartime - US and Turkey Hold Lengthy Secret Talks

[Central News Agency, New York, 17th, United Press] Admiral Conolly, commander of the U.S. Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Fleet, stated that the "special composite fleet" sent by the United States to the Mediterranean is of a scale similar to that of wartime.

[United Press, Malta, 17th] The U.S. aircraft carrier "Midway," escorted by the destroyers "Perry" and "Edison" and the light cruisers "Little Rock" and "Providence," sailed to Malta on the 17th, awaiting the arrival of 1,000 Marines from the United States scheduled to arrive tomorrow.

[United Press, Ankara, 17th] President Ä°nÃ¶nÃ¼ and U.S. Ambassador Wilson held talks at the presidential residence until dawn on the 17th, causing much excitement here and numerous rumors. Both the U.S. Embassy and Turkish officials declined to comment on the matter.

### Aid to Europe Is Not for Obtaining Bases - Marshall Issues Statement - Intention Is Only to Rebuild European Economy

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] After Secretary of Defense Forrestal stated in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday about the possible connection between the European Recovery Program and obtaining overseas bases, the State Department received information that Forrestal's remarks had aroused extreme interest and concern in Europe. Therefore, Secretary of State Marshall issued a statement today, stating that the European Recovery Program currently under review by Congress neither stipulates nor contemplates obtaining military bases in exchange for U.S. economic aid to Europe.

The intention of U.S. aid is solely to enable countries participating in the recovery program to rebuild their sound and strong economies. This objective does not conflict with the opinions expressed by Secretary of Defense Forrestal to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In response to a question about the importance of overseas bases, Forrestal stated that he did not dispute this concept and believed that the Secretary of State had not forgotten this point either, but he believed that, in terms of priorities, he should first consider the restoration of the recipient countries' national beliefs. Forrestal's remarks have apparently been misinterpreted.

### Molotov Hosts Diplomatic Envoys

[Reuters, Moscow, 17th] British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Peterson, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, along with diplomatic representatives from other countries, attended a reception hosted by Mr. and Mrs. Molotov today for Polish Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz and his trade delegation.

### Wallace Delivers Speech, Advocates Forming a Third Party, and Criticizes Truman and the Aid to Europe Plan

[Reuters, Chicago, 17th] U.S. presidential election independent candidate Henry Wallace delivered a speech here today to the second annual meeting of the American Progressive Citizens Association, formally advocating the establishment of a third party "for peace, security, and prosperity." He pointed out that the "Truman Doctrine" and the "Marshall Plan, misusing the name of European Recovery," are "war policies controlled by big business for its own benefit," and said, "The inflation and excessive profit plans of the Democratic and Republican parties will cause economic panic and the outbreak of war." Wallace also suggested: immediately increase wages, stipulate a minimum wage of one dollar per hour, preserve and promote the legal system of forty hours per week of work; implement effective controls to lower prices, strip away windfall profits gained from inflation, and reject the bi-partisan "eat less" policy of Taft and Truman; abolish the Taft-Hartley Act restricting union activities; abandon policies heading toward war. Wallace also said: "If the Democratic government had not abandoned the Roosevelt plan, my supporters would not have been forced to establish a new party. In the January election, millions of voters will elect those who refuse to agree to policies that cause another world war and plunge the U.S. economy into an unprecedented depression. The current out-of-control price increases are all caused by government, big business fraud, and Wall Street's windfall profits. Although the Democratic and Republican parties see inflation as a sin, they have not taken genuine steps to combat it. President Truman has only made ineffective gestures, and his proposed war policies will inevitably lead to higher prices and greater profits."

### Balkan Committee Accuses Albania of Supporting Greek Guerrillas - Second Report to Trygve Lie

[Reuters, Athens, 17th] The United Nations Balkan Committee recently submitted its second interim report to United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie, paying special attention to the recent incident in the Yannina-Konitsa area. The conclusion reached was that Albania provided various strategic and material aid to the Greek guerrillas during the attack on Konitsa and assisted them in organizing supplies. The report is based on the conclusions reached by the committee's team, which was sent to the front line from December 29th to January 2nd to investigate. The report also recognizes that Albania's aid to Greek guerrillas is contrary to the spirit of the UN General Assembly resolution of October 21st last year. Furthermore, it said that the speech made by the Bulgarian Prime Minister on December 31st also reflects Bulgaria's failure to comply with the UN General Assembly's recommendations to establish good neighborly relations with Greece.

### Italy Establishes Anti-Communist Liberation Army

[United Press, Rome, 18th] Marshal Messe, who led Italian troops in battles against the Soviet Union and Tunisia during the war, was appointed chairman of the Italian Liberation Army, an anti-communist center in military circles, on the 18th. At the same time, Prime Minister Nitti immediately declared that Messe had no connection with the neo-fascist Social Movement.

### Italy Pardons Prisoners

[Reuters, Rome, 17th] The Italian cabinet today approved an amnesty law to reduce death sentences to life imprisonment and life imprisonment to 30 years imprisonment.

### Britain and France Plan to Build Channel Tunnel to Defend Against Atomic Bomb Attacks

[United Press, Paris, 17th] Britain and France began negotiations here today for an underground tunnel under the English Channel for trains and cars, which can also withstand atomic bomb attacks. The two countries have been negotiating the construction of an underwater tunnel for a year. This time, it is hosted by British Labor MP Crossman and Conservative MP Bullock, as well as the French members of the United Tunnel Committee. According to the current design of Basterfang, the head of the committee's technical team, the tunnel starts from Cap Griz-Nez in France to Folkestone in England, with a total length of 28 miles and an estimated cost of 50 million pounds sterling. It is an average of 50 feet underground, 160 to 220 feet lower than the sea surface. In the event of war, an atomic bomb explosion in the air or on the water surface would have little impact. The previous tunnel plan was only for trains, winding from Calais to Dover, a distance of 30 miles. Engineers now advocate adopting a straight line, with double tracks for railways and two separate lanes for highways, along with air ducts and water pumps, electric lights, and ventilation equipment.

### US Bans Flying Over Nuclear Energy Plants

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] President Truman has ordered a ban on flying over three nuclear sites: the Clinton Engineering Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee; the Hanford Engineering Works in Richland, Washington; and the Los Alamos plant in Los Alamos, New Mexico.

### Japan Builds 200,000 Tons of Ships Since the End of the War

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] According to charts shown to reporters by senior officials of the Japanese Ministry of Transport responsible for shipping, Japan has built 200,000 tons of ships since the end of the war: 130,000 tons in 1946 and 60,000 tons in 1947 up to the end of November. Japan currently has one million tons of diesel ships, of which 930,000 tons are usable, and the remainder is in dock for repairs due to prolonged use. Japan's post-war domestic routes require a minimum of 4.5 million tons of ships. If Japan can fully utilize its shipbuilding equipment, it can build 800,000 tons of ships per year.

### Japanese Socialist Party Subcommittee Decides to Abolish Four-Party Agreement - Submitted to the General Assembly for Final Decision

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] On the afternoon of the 17th, the second day of the third national convention of the Socialist Party, the subcommittee was held. First, Chairman Suzuki of the Policy Investigation Committee explained the proposal to abolish the four-party policy agreement and suspend the payment of interest on wartime government bonds.

The left and right factions engaged in fierce debate, causing chaos at the venue, which lasted for about two hours before being put to a vote. As a result, it was passed by a vote of 24 to 19 (one abstention), and it was decided to submit it to the plenary session today for final decision.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] Since the opening of the Japanese Socialist Party Congress, the situation seems to be quite intense due to the control of the venue by Kato Kanjyu, chairman of the government investigation committee. There is a high probability that the four-party policy agreement will be abolished. The third day of the meeting continued today, and the 11 committees separately reviewed more than 60 proposals submitted by various branches. After the deliberation by the committees was completed in the afternoon, a general meeting was convened again, and the chairmen of the committees reported the results of the review by their respective groups, and the issue of the four-party policy agreement was raised again, requesting a new decision. At the same time, the issue of the candidates for the party chairman and secretary-general is being asked to be nominated by the same faction, but the left-wing has not yet officially expressed its attitude. It seems that they will be willing to express peace or war only after the issue of the four-party policy agreement is resolved.

### Japanese Postal and Telecommunications Fees Increase Threefold

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] The Japanese Cabinet decided yesterday to increase all postal and telecommunications fees threefold from the 15th of this month, which will increase our revenue by 13 times this fiscal year.

### Yap Island Tsunami

[United Press, Pearl Harbor, 17th] A tsunami struck Yap Island, a small U.S. outpost in the western Pacific, yesterday, destroying most of the island's buildings and all of its food supplies. The island's 3,000 residents fled to higher ground, avoiding disaster. The tsunami occurred 48 hours after a typhoon passed through.

### Socialist Party Left and Right Factions Fight and Wrestle Together

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] The Japanese Social Democratic Party Congress fell into chaos when frantic left-wingers and right-wingers fought and tried to wrestle with the chairman of the congress, Komakichi Matsuoka.

### Eastern Europe Decides to Strengthen Economic Cooperation - Organization of Federation Still Pending - Hopes to Trade with Western Europe on Equal Principles

[Associated Press, Bucharest, 17th] Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov declared before boarding a train to return home after signing the Romanian-Bulgarian mutual assistance treaty in Bucharest: The Eastern European countries will organize a federation as soon as the time is ripe and will carry out large-scale cooperation with the Soviet Union. If possible, they also plan to try to trade with the United States, Britain, and France on a completely equal principle.

[United Press, Prague, 18th] Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov said that the strengthening of economic cooperation among the Balkan countries can be the basis for starting trade with Western Europe and possibly with the United States. He said, "We hope to cooperate economically with Britain, the United States, France, and other countries, but cooperation must be based on the principle of equality. We oppose the imperialist policies implemented by British and American trusts, but the Danube countries hope to maintain good economic relations with all Western European countries, and this cannot be decided unilaterally by us."

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] Officials declared today that Communist International leader Dimitrov's announcement that an Eastern European Federation will soon be established shows that the Soviet Union is prepared to take the final step to permanently consolidate its control over the countries behind the Iron Curtain. Dimitrov's statement roughly represents the Communist Party's high policy and is worthy of attention. The nature of the Communist Party's opposition to the Marshall European Recovery Program has not changed as a result and is even more obvious, which is an inevitable result. If Western and Eastern Europe cooperate according to the Marshall Plan, although it will not hinder the establishment of the Eastern European Federation, it will inevitably add complications.

### At the Canluan and National Construction Mobilization Conference, Refugees Bitterly Narrate the Atrocities of the Communist Bandits - Speaker Appeals to Citizens to Concentrate Their Efforts to Overcome Difficulties Together

[Our Report] Speaker Pan of the Shanghai Municipal Council, at the Shanghai Municipal People of All Circles Canluan and National Construction Mobilization Conference yesterday, delivered a speech to more than 3,000 people from all walks of life about the Communist bandits' rebellion, which endangers China's destiny, and made a painful statement: "National survival, national livelihood, and people's lives are all seriously threatened by the Communist bandits. With the destruction of the Communist bandits, there is no existence of the Republic of China."

This unprecedented Canluan and National Construction Mobilization Conference was held at the Tianchan Dance Hall yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m. More than 3,000 representatives from more than 1,000 units from all circles in the city and refugees from the bandit areas in northern Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong also sent representatives to participate. The venue was packed, and the atmosphere was extremely passionate. The conference was presided over by Pan Gongzhan as the general chairman, with Mayor Wu, Fang Zhi, Xu Jiguang, Wang Xiaolai, Wu Yun, Chu Zheng Yuxiu, Xiao Bingshing, Tao Baichuan, Xie Renzhao, and Chen Baotai as the presidium. Inside and outside the venue, Boy Scouts and military police maintained order. At the beginning of the conference, General Chairman Pan first delivered an opening speech, explaining the meaning and objectives of the mobilization conference. He continued: "In the two years since the victory, the international status that the country had fought for with unlimited sacrifices has been destroyed by the Communist rebellion. After eight years of war and chaos, the Chinese people all need to recuperate and rest and need construction and production. But we have not obtained the peaceful and prosperous lives that we hoped for, and 450 million people are still living in hardship. We deeply review that the destroyers of the country and the people's happiness and interests are also the Communist bandits' rebellion. The people of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, and the northeastern provinces were originally able to live in peace and prosperity after the victory, but now a large number of them are fleeing to other places or filling ditches. They are the most direct victims of the Communist bandits' rebellion. In addition to providing passive relief and assistance in terms of human sympathy, we must trace the root cause of this man-made disaster and actively participate in the work of suppressing bandits and chaos, so that cruel atrocities will never be seen again in history. If thousands of people believe that the work of 'Suppressing Chaos and Building the Country' only belongs to the Nationalists, this is a major illusion. What the Chinese people hope for is a 'Three Principles of the People Republic,' so that a true democratic unity can be realized, and the people of the whole country must jointly shoulder the responsibility of suppressing chaos. We are holding this mobilization conference today in the hope that the people of the whole city will concentrate their efforts from today onwards, overcome difficulties together, and give the Communist bandits' rebellion a fatal blow, hoping to completely eliminate it."

### Mayor Wu's Warning - If Communist Bandits Are Not Eliminated, China Will Perish

Mayor Wu then delivered a speech, saying: After eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, although we have achieved a great victory, the people's lives still cannot be peaceful and prosperous, and China's international status has also trended downward again. The Kowloon incident would never have happened if the international status had not declined. The reason for this is the Communist bandits' armed rebellion, which destroys unity. The government has the responsibility to maintain national stability, so it has to make the determination to suppress chaos with great pain. Therefore, if the Communist bandits hand over their weapons and the country is unified, there will be no problem in recovering Hong Kong and Kowloon today. Wu concluded: If the Communist bandits are not eliminated, China will perish, and if the Communist bandits are eliminated, China will be strong. I hope the citizens will recognize the goal and work together for Suppressing Chaos and Building the Country. Then Chairman Fang delivered a speech, emphasizing that if the country is to be built, chaos must be suppressed first. If chaos is not suppressed, construction cannot begin. Fang continued to point out that what the Communist bandits have done will not only destroy China but also endanger world peace. Fang then described in detail the atrocities of the Communist bandits in the bandit areas. Next, Xiao Bingshing, the representative of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department of the Youth Party, delivered a speech, elaborating on two points: Our country has always been a nation that loves peace and lives in peace, and the people of the country should strive to win it. Everyone should "have food to eat," not "everyone have food to eat".

### Searching for Young People to Drive to the Front Lines

Subsequently, representatives of exiled students from the communist areas, Yang Hanxun; refugees from northern Jiangsu, Sha Ren; refugees from Shandong, Cui Derun; and refugees from Anhui, Shi Guocong, successively reported on various atrocities they had personally witnessed in the communist areas. Yang Hanxun, when describing the actions of the communist bandits, referred to them as "not something a human would do; it's simply the behavior of beasts." He stated, "Wherever the communist bandits occupy, they search for ignorant villagers and young people, driving them to the front lines, using the people to suppress the rear, and ultimately using them as the main force to supervise the battle. The number of innocent civilians sacrificed is countless, and there have been situations where the national army has delayed military opportunities because they couldn't bear to kill ordinary people. Economically, they exploit everything to the extreme, requiring taxes of over 60 percent of the harvest, and forcing people to use unlimitedly issued counterfeit currency to collect resources."

Four Types of Torture

The following are several common tortures used in the communist areas: Boiling: The victim is stripped naked, their hands and feet tightly bound, and thrown into the river. Live Burial: The victim is buried entirely in the soil, with only their head exposed. After a month, their head is struck with a hammer, causing blood and brains to fly, leading to death. Crawling: Iron nails are hammered into the victim's fingers and toes, forcing them to crawl. Hanging: The victim's hands and feet are tied behind their back, and they are hung in the air, dying after several days.

Misled by the Communist Party, Forced to Kill His Father

The representative from northern Jiangsu, Sha Ren, in a sorrowful tone, recounted how he was a small businessman who was deceived by the communist bandits' "democracy" slogan and participated in the communist cadre work. However, during several "struggles," he was eventually ordered to kill his elderly father, who was of the petty bourgeoisie class. After returning home, he could only exchange tears with his father and couldn't bring himself to do it, so he changed clothes and fled his hometown overnight. However, his father was still eventually killed. Sha Ren also stated, "The communist bandits not only kill property owners within the occupied areas but also intellectuals. If the communist bandits come to Shanghai, everyone present today would also be on the list to be killed. When the communist bandits hold meetings, they don't hang the national flag or the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, but instead hang the flag with the sickle and axe and portraits of Lenin and Marx. Their treacherous conspiracy to sell out the country is already clearly visible. I am now a traitor to the communist party, but I firmly believe that actively participating in the suppression of the rebellion is a manifestation of pursuing truth and upholding justice." Cui Derun, the representative from Shandong, is a typical northern farmer. He was arrested along with his brother for the "crime" of having received elementary school education. After being detained for eight months and released, his brother was eventually executed by firing squad.

One Word Leads to Disaster and a Tragic Death

The representative from Anhui, Shi Guoting, recounted the tragic death story of a classmate from his elementary school days. The victim's "crime" was merely accidentally uttering the words "The Communist Party doesn't have much of a solution for the country either," which was overheard by a "communist special agent." He was then dragged along the ground with his hands tied behind his back, called "taking an airplane," and eventually died covered in blood. After the reports were finished, they passed a "Salute to President Chiang telegram" and a "Condolence telegram to the suppression of bandits generals and soldiers on the front lines," and then the entire assembly shouted slogans such as "Concentrate our efforts to suppress the rebellion and build the country," "Eliminate the communist bandits who disrupt peace," and "Demand that the government negotiate sternly to recover Hong Kong, Kowloon, Lushun, and Dalian." The ceremony concluded at 11:30 AM, and then entertainment programs were held, dispersing at noon. The municipal party headquarters' propaganda brigade dispatched several vehicles after the meeting and went to various districts for costumed propaganda until late at night.

US Donates Wireless Radio Equipment to Assist Our Amateur Activities: Remarks by Zhu Qiqing Upon Returning to China

Mr. Zhu Qiqing, the chief editor of the China Amateur Wireless Radio Association, was dispatched to the United States in July of last year as a representative of amateur radio enthusiasts in our country to attend the International Telecommunications Conference and exchange views on general issues with amateur radio enthusiasts from other countries. He has now returned to Shanghai. During his time in the United States, Mr. Zhu was warmly welcomed by tens of thousands of amateur radio enthusiasts across the country. Our reporter visited Mr. Zhu yesterday to inquire about his impressions and gains from this trip. According to him, "Amateur radio activities in the United States are very advanced and lead the world, with over ten thousand radio stations. There is one radio station for every 1,500 people. During our country's war of resistance, the people of the United States admired us for utilizing limited equipment and facilities to actively engage in amateur activities and assist military communications. They believe that postwar wireless amateur activities in our country are crucial for telecommunications education and construction, and they are extremely willing to provide assistance. After discussions with academic groups such as the American Radio Relay League, General Electric Company, and other commercial firms, they have donated dozens of boxes of large quantities of vacuum tubes, transceivers, and other essential accessories, worth tens of thousands of US dollars, which are currently being shipped to China in batches."

### Various Industries Join Trade Associations: The Bureau of Social Affairs Formulates Three Measures

[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the issue of membership in trade associations for various industries that distribute rationed goods, the Bureau of Social Affairs has previously received complaints from representatives of various industries that are not members, alleging that the associations refuse to admit them, creating a situation of control and monopoly, and harming the interests of the same industry. According to the various industry associations, there are often fictitious firms engaging in speculation and attempting to join the association to obtain rations.

The Bureau of Social Affairs believes that joining industry associations is compulsory by law and that associations should not arbitrarily refuse membership. However, to prevent unscrupulous merchants from engaging in speculation and profiteering, they should not be allowed to exploit loopholes and harm the development of legitimate businesses. To take both into account, the Bureau of Social Affairs has formulated three measures, instructing the various industry associations to comply: Companies, factories, and businesses that distribute rationed goods and already have a company license, factory registration certificate from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, or a business registration certificate from the Bureau of Social Affairs, shall be allowed to join the association. If there are fictitious firms or concealment of distributed goods, violating the principles of preventing speculation and profiteering by merchants, the association shall report it to the Bureau of Social Affairs to revoke the business registration certificate or request the Ministry of Economic Affairs to revoke their license or factory registration certificate. The rights of new members (regarding ration distribution after joining the association) may be determined by the association's board of directors and supervisors, and a proposal submitted to the Bureau for approval before implementation. Subsequently, if the same situation arises, it should be handled in accordance with the above measures to ensure fairness and compliance with the law.

### American Missionary in Kaifeng Arrives in Shanghai, Discussing How the People in the Communist Bandit Areas Suffer Extreme Tyranny and Oppression

[Report from this newspaper] After the communist bandits shot and killed three foreign missionaries near Laohekou, the American Missionary Society ordered its personnel to withdraw south. Mr. Harris, the person in charge of the Baptist Church in Kaifeng, also withdrew to Shanghai some days ago. Mr. Harris has been preaching in China for thirty-seven years and will be returning to his country because of his old age. Our reporter visited Mr. Harris yesterday, and he shared his views on the communist bandits. Based on his years of observation and experience, Mr. Harris believes that anyone with reason and a true democratic view cannot compromise with the communist bandits. The impression of the communist bandits held by many people and church members who have escaped from the communist areas is that their methods are even harsher than those of the Japanese soldiers, and the extent of their destruction is more cruel than that of the Japanese invaders. Mr. Harris personally witnessed the communist bandits destroying railways and burning villages, which made him realize that the communist bandits' goal is to disrupt the national economy, make it impossible for every ordinary person to live and work in peace, and even make it impossible to make a living, trying every means to accomplish their conspiracy.

Major Losses of Rights and Freedoms

The reporter then asked whether the rumour that the communist bandits' administrative efficiency was generally higher was true. Mr. Harris immediately answered affirmatively that administrative efficiency might be slightly higher under a despotic and dictatorial regime. The dictatorial style of Hitler in the past was like this. However, the people's rights and freedoms suffer greatly as a result, and this loss cannot be compensated by the gains obtained after the administrative efficiency is improved. The people in the communist bandit areas suffer exploitation and oppression, which makes them feel even more fearful of the communist bandits' autocratic politics and cherish democratic politics.

Private Land Forcibly Divided Publicly

The reporter also asked that some people abroad have praised the communist bandits' land policy quite a bit, but what is the actual situation? Mr. Harris said that the communist bandits' so-called equal distribution of land is actually a deceptive policy. For example, Mr. Harris has a friend who owns more than 80 mu of land, but this is the property jointly owned by more than 40 members of their family. However, the family has not yet separated, and if it is divided, each person will only get two mu of land, but the communist bandits insist that they are big landlords and forcibly divide their land publicly. "In fact, how can more than 80 mu of land be called a big landlord?" Mr. Harris continued, "In the United States, it is very common to have landlords with hundreds of acres of land. I am a poor missionary, and I also have more than 500 acres of land (Note: One acre is equal to 6.07 Chinese mu). If I were a Chinese person living in the communist bandit area, wouldn't they also take my land and divide it equally?"

Full Assistance Will Come Sooner or Later

Mr. Harris also expressed his feelings about the current political situation in the central government, believing that the government's administrative efficiency should be improved, the organization of the masses should be more in-depth, and the administration should be clarified as soon as possible in order to increase the people's confidence in the government. In the military aspect, he believes that morale must be improved, and the grand strategy for suppressing the bandits should be to fight fire with fire, extensively launching guerrilla warfare so that the communist bandits are attacked everywhere. Mr. Harris also said with great confidence that the American people and government will understand the situation in China sooner or later, and they will provide China with full assistance sooner or later.

### Freight Rates Increased on Two Railways: The Chamber of Commerce Cables the Government to Stop

After the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration adjusted passenger and freight rates, the Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce was the first to appeal, requesting the government to stop it. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has also begun to respond, cabling the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications yesterday, requesting that the passenger and freight rates on the two railways be reasonably adjusted, and accusing the Railway Administration of acting contrary to the government's policy of suppressing price levels and stabilizing the economy. The Chamber of Commerce argued that after the dramatic increase in freight rates, industrial and commercial costs also increased, which would inevitably stimulate a sharp rise in prices. In addition to increasing revenue, the Railway Administration can also reduce expenditures, cutting redundant staff and curbing waste, which may be sufficient to help achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure. However, it is now draining the pond to catch the fish, specializing in drastically increasing freight rates. Therefore, it urged the government to order the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration to stop the mad increase in passenger and freight rates and make reasonable adjustments.

### The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Society of Mechanical Engineers Is Established

Since the establishment of the general headquarters of the Chinese Society of Mechanical Engineers in the summer of 1936, its members across the country have exceeded one thousand. During the War of Resistance, the Shanghai branch's affairs were suspended. After the victory, members from various places returned, and over twenty people in the Shanghai engineering community, including Wang Jingrong, Zhang Gongpin, and Hu Songyan, initiated the establishment of a branch and launched a fundraising campaign of 60 million to build a clubhouse. A temporary clubhouse has now been established in Jiaotong University's Gongchuo Hall, and a founding meeting was held in the hall yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Over fifty people, including Cheng Xiaogang, president of the Chinese Society of Engineers, attended, with Huang Boqiao serving as temporary chairman. Jiaotong University professor Hu Songyan reported on the preparations, the articles of association were approved, and Chen Shiying was elected as the first president, with Hu Songyan as vice president. Both are professors in the engineering college of Jiaotong University. Li Taifang, Chen Da, Wu Liangbi, Zhou Chengyou, and Yuan Bulie were elected as secretaries, and the meeting was declared concluded. Subsequently, Huang Boqiao, a senior figure in the engineering community, gave a speech stating that he hoped that the Shanghai branch would not only devote itself to academic development and research, but also hope that the association would complete the division of labor in automatic machinery manufacturing, shipbuilding, and other technologies, form specialized committees, and cooperate closely with industrial institutions to fully exploit the efficiency of machinery.

### Many Fires Due to Severe Winter Dryness: Sixty Fires in Half a Month, Reasons Why a Thousand-Member Volunteer Fire Brigade Is Difficult to Realize, Few People Are Willing to Undertake Hard and Dangerous Work

[Special report from this newspaper] Fire! Fire! A heart-stopping fire has occurred again in the city in the past few days. Every day, every night, countless lives and property are sacrificed in the raging flames of fire. According to statistics from the Municipal Police Bureau's Fire Department, within half a month since the beginning of 1948, they have dispatched fire engines 69 times. Among them, excluding seven false alarms and two special protective measures for theaters, there were a total of 60 fire rescues. Although only 23 of them were major fires, the remaining 37 were extinguished early. However, an average of four fire alarms per day is enough to make us feel afraid.

Fires are closely related to the climate. It is customary that the number of fires is highest and the damage is most severe in the three months of December, January, and February. The reason for the high number is that the weather is cold and dry, and there are more cases of burning fires for heating. If one is not careful, it will lead to a disaster. If you encounter strong winds, it will be even more uncontrollable, so everyone should be extra cautious and careful during this severe winter.

Firefighting agencies are gradually being strengthened

When a fire occurs, it depends on the fire department to put it out. Since the Wuding Road fire last year, society has a new understanding of the importance of firefighting work. The firefighting agencies have been gradually strengthened under the supervision and assistance of all parties. In the past year, the funding and personnel have increased significantly, and the treatment has been improved, and tools have been added to give greater play to the performance and protect the public safety of citizens.

The department is now under the jurisdiction of the police bureau, and the general team is divided into nine district teams. The firefighting personnel include office staff, technicians, workers, etc., and there are currently 867 people. In terms of vehicles, there are now six light-duty ladder trucks, seventeen medium-sized pump trucks, sixteen large-sized pump trucks, one steam pump truck, one fireboat, one towing pump truck, six fire extinguishing and guard vehicles, ten special vehicles such as rescue vehicles and lighting vehicles, seventeen ambulances, and sixty-six other official vehicles, transport vehicles, bicycles, etc. Old water belts have been discarded, and more than 34,000 feet have been added in the past year. New vehicles are also being ordered from abroad, but due to foreign exchange difficulties and other reasons, it is difficult to realize in the short term.

Depends on the cooperation of all departments

To do a good job in firefighting, it is necessary to rely on the cooperation of relevant departments. For example, the water source at the fire location is the determining factor in extinguishing the fire. If the faucet is damaged or the water source pressure is too low, the fire brigade will be helpless, but many citizens misunderstand that the fire brigade is indifferent. For example, there have been frequent power outages in the Nanshi and French Concession areas recently. When a fire occurs, the water and electricity company must be notified temporarily to open it, which has an impact on the rescue time. All of these are technical difficulties in firefighting work. In view of this, the Municipal Administration Bureau established a firefighting committee at the end of November last year, which is composed of public and private organizations such as the Municipal Government, Police Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, Senate, and local associations, and holds regular monthly meetings to discuss and solve various firefighting issues together.

### Every Citizen Should Fulfill Their Responsibility

At the same time, because the danger of fire is closely related to every citizen, fire prevention is also the responsibility of every citizen, so the fire department attempted to organize a volunteer fire brigade of 1,000 people to assist in firefighting work, but this proposal has not been followed up by the Civil Affairs Bureau since it was transferred to the various Baojia last year. It is said that because this kind of work is too hard and dangerous, few people are willing to undertake it on a voluntary basis. In fact, this is related to the immediate interests of every citizen, and the fire department hopes that everyone can understand its significance and should participate enthusiastically.

Finally, readers, please remember that if a fire occurs, you should quickly call the fire department. The number is "15440".

### Eight Thousand Tons of US Relief Flour Arrive: Acceptance Ceremony Today, Ration Distribution Expected to Begin in March, Proceeds Earmarked for Relief Expenses

Eight thousand tons of US relief flour, transported by the California Wheel, arrived in China and entered the Huangpu River on the afternoon of the 18th, berthed at the China Merchants Bureau's Pier No. 1. At 3 PM today, the Chairman of the Relief Goods Processing Committee, Miao Jiaming, Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, representatives from the United States, and others will board the ship to hold an acceptance ceremony and express their condolences to the US transportation personnel.

### Miao Jiaming's Remarks

Miao Jiaming, chairman of the Executive Yuan's US Relief Goods Processing Committee, met with reporters on the 18th and answered questions regarding the processing of US relief goods, saying that the US government has donated approximately US$30 million worth of relief goods to China. The food portion of these goods includes 50,000 tons of flour (part of which is wheat) and 75,000 tons of rice, which are being shipped to China in succession, and some of them have already arrived in Shanghai. In addition, medical and health equipment worth approximately US$4 million has been requested to be listed by the Ministry of Health and sent to the US government, and it will be shipped to China soon. In addition, there are a small number of fertilizers and seeds included in the relief materials.

The Distribution Targets Strive for Universality

After the US grain is shipped to China, the Chinese government will take appropriate steps in accordance with the agreement in cities that have already conducted distribution to ensure that people of all classes receive fair and equal shares. However, due to the limited quantity, the distribution will first be implemented in the five cities with dense populations and lack of food. The distribution targets will strive for universality to ensure that everyone can benefit. All preparations for food distribution are currently being carried out by the authorities of the five cities, divided into distribution committees, which are proceeding separately. The specific distribution methods are also being planned in detail by the committee and the various municipal committees. The Beijing and Shanghai municipal committees have been established, and the Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Wuhan municipal committees will also be established successively. In the future, the distribution work in each city will be carried out by the municipal committees, entrusted to government agencies and volunteer organizations. It is now estimated that the US grain to be shipped to China is 125,000 tons. According to the average distribution of the population of the five cities, it is planned to be a four-month period. According to preliminary statistics, each person can obtain about five liters of grain per month. As for the distribution price, it will be lower than the market price. It will be adjusted once a month to achieve the goal of stabilizing grain prices. This distribution work is expected to begin in March.

Distribution Status Will Be Released at Any Time

As for the disposal of relief materials by the committee, it will be based on the principle of fairness. The work will be carried out absolutely openly. The committee's administrative accounting will be handled by personnel sent by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and the financial accounting will be handled by accountants. The National Bank will handle the receipt and payment. The material battle situation and distribution status will also be released in reports at any time. The funds obtained will be used in full for relief expenses in accordance with the agreement. This is the food portion.

Medical Equipment Can Be Applied For

Regarding the medical and health equipment portion, the competent authorities are also properly formulating measures. In the future, direct relief will be implemented with medical equipment on the one hand, and a portion of the medical equipment will be sold, and the funds obtained will also be used for relief activities. The distribution of the funds will be based on the principle of national coverage. Any public or private constructive or relief projects that urgently need subsidies can submit detailed plans to the committee for review and allocation by the committee together with the US side. In order to plan relief work, the committee has also established health, medical, and social relief committees, inviting experts from both the US and China to participate, responsible for designing and reviewing plans requesting assistance from all parties.

### Tokyo War Crimes Trials, Individual Arguments Conclude, Court Hearings Nearly Three Thousand Hours, Creating an Unprecedented World Record, Dr. Mei Ru'ao Returns to China Arrives in Shanghai and Speaks

Dr. Mei Ru'ao, the Chinese representative judge of the Far East Military Tribunal, returned to China from Tokyo on the 17th and arrived in Shanghai. The reporter visited him and inquired about the recent situation of the Tokyo war crimes trials. According to Mei, the Far East International Tribunal has been working very intensively since its resumption on August 4 last year. The court is held for five or six hours a day, not including the judges' meetings. Since the opening of the court in May of the previous year, the public trial has lasted for nearly three thousand hours in twenty months, and the court records have reached more than 38,000 pages, more than double that of the Nuremberg trials. It is truly an unprecedented record in the history of world justice. Since the beginning of the individual defense phase of the war criminals in early September last year, the work of the court has become more active, the mood has become more tense, and the world's interest in the long-silent Tokyo trials has become stronger, and the audience seats are full, especially when Tojo was tried. The individual defense of war criminals is in alphabetical order by their English surnames, from Araki to Umezu, and took a total of four and a half months. Among them, Tojo, Togo, and Oshima spent more than a week each, while the rest averaged about three days per person, and the shorter ones only took one day or half a day. Now the individual defense of these twenty-five Japanese Class A war criminals has been completed last week, and the Tokyo trial has come to a general conclusion, and it is approaching the end.

Final Debate to Be Held at the End of the Month

At this moment, both the prosecutors and the defendants are concentrating on carefully analyzing and reviewing all the evidence presented over the past twenty-odd months, as well as all relevant legal facts, making judgments, and preparing "comprehensive arguments" to be submitted to the court and read aloud at the "final debate court" to be held at the end of the month. After the end of the final debate court, the Tokyo public trial will come to an end, and the court will announce its closing. Then, judges from eleven countries will hold a deliberation meeting, determine the sentences, and draft the judgment, and then announce the sentence on a regular basis. This is the end of all the work of the Far East International Tribunal.

Participating in the Election Without Campaigning

The reporter asked Mei whether he would take the time to return to his hometown to participate in the election because he was nominated as a candidate for this year's Jiangxi legislator. Mei replied: I have been a legislator for fourteen years, and I have presided over the Foreign Affairs, Translation, and Foreign-related Legislation committees. I am willing to use my many years of experience to continue to serve the country in legislative work. However, domestic and foreign transportation is currently difficult, and the work in Tokyo is becoming increasingly tense and urgent. It is impossible for me to return to my hometown to campaign, but I still believe that the local voters will be able to elect the people they want to elect and should elect. As for personal gains and losses, I have no concerns. He is scheduled to go to Nanjing tonight to report on his duties and is scheduled to fly to Japan on the 24th in order to participate in the unveiling of the final decisive scene of the Tokyo trial in time.

### Dance Schools Send Representatives to Nanjing to Appeal Again

[Report from this newspaper] The 29 dance schools in the city were ordered to close down because the government was practicing a frugality movement and have repeatedly petitioned the relevant departments, requesting that the order be revoked. The Municipal Council and the Municipal Party Department have agreed to forward their requests to the authorities for consideration. However, after the Executive Yuan's ban on dance orders and measures arrived here some days ago, it still stipulates that dance schools should be banned. The Dance School Friendship Association specially hosted the press yesterday, and representatives Zhou Yuehan and Bao Longyun explained respectively: Since dance schools do not violate the principle of frugality or train dancing girls, there seems to be no reason to order them to close. The famous American dance teacher Oshaman Lai was hired by the British Emperor to teach dance at the palace, and the British Dance Art Research Institute holds competitions every year, and the government also awards bonuses. It seems that the research of dance art should not be restricted. Finally, a dance film was shown, showing dance art. It is heard that the petitioning representatives are scheduled to enter Nanjing today to appeal to the Executive Yuan again.

### Association for Promoting the Use of Domestic Goods Holds Board Meeting

### U.S. Presidential Liner - Extremely Luxurious - The President Cleveland Arrives in Port - Drawing Room Decorated with Chinese Colors

[Our Newspaper's Report] Within this week, one of the largest commercial ships built by the United States after the war will arrive in Shanghai. The ship is named President Cleveland and was just built in December of last year at the Alameda Shipyard in California. This voyage to the Far East is her maiden voyage, traveling from San Francisco via Honolulu, Manila, Hong Kong, Shanghai, to Yokohama, Japan, and then returning to the United States via Honolulu.

The President Cleveland weighs 23,000 tons, can carry 550 passengers, and has a cargo capacity of 300,000 cubic feet. All modern equipment inside the ship is extremely luxurious and comfortable. In addition to climate control, automatic ventilation, and reclining sofa beds, there is also a swimming pool. The ship is equipped with telephones throughout, and the drawing room is decorated with luxurious Chinese colors. The ship's construction uses high-level fireproof materials.

The ship is managed by the President Lines Company. According to the scheduled voyage, it was expected to arrive in Hong Kong yesterday and will arrive in Shanghai on the 22nd.

According to the person in charge of the President Lines Company, another sister ship of the Cleveland, the President Wilson, will join the Pacific route this spring. It is hoped that five more new ships can be added within the next year, circumnavigating the globe. These specially designed new ships are currently under construction, with a construction cost of approximately US$50 million. In addition, the company plans to renovate the General Meigs and General Gordon, which currently operate in the Far East, as these two ships were built during the war and are less well-equipped.

### Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association Establishes Rehabilitation Workshop

The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association's First Lung Hospital recently established a workshop at its Hongqiao Road Huaiyin Road location, named the "Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Rehabilitation Workshop." Its purpose is to provide a light work training program under the guidance of doctors for general pulmonary tuberculosis patients in the post-recovery stage, who are not strong enough to return to their original work. Patients are diagnosed and approved by a doctor (mainly based on multiple germ-free tests and normal temperature), and with their consent, they are given an appropriate amount of work, guided by experts. The working hours depend on the patient's physical strength and can be adjusted at any time. Doctors regularly examine the patients until their bodies have fully recovered and their working ability has returned to its original state. The advantages of this approach are: 1) patients can receive reasonable treatment until their health is restored; 2) patients can reduce their burden by earning income from work, thereby relieving their emotional anxiety; 3) they can learn a skill for self-reliance. However, the association is limited by its finances and hopes for assistance from all sectors of society so that it can be completed as soon as possible.

### The Young Commander of the Jungar Banner, Major General Qi Zhizhong, and the Inside Story of the Mongol Banners

[Our Newspaper's Special Dispatch from Guisui, November 11] Ever since the Jungar Banner's security cavalry blocked the Communist bandits from crossing the Yellow River westward at Yulin when they were surrounded, and then recovered Fugou County, the 27-year-old Commander Qi Zhizhong has once again made the declining Yangjiawan, after fifteen years, a center of military affairs, politics, and wealth on the border area between Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan. At the same time, the Qi surname aristocratic family of Yangjiawan has regained in the minds of the Mongol and Han people the prominent position it had during the era of Qi Zhizhong's grandfather, Nasan Dalai. The Qi surname aristocratic family of Yangjiawan in Jungar Banner is one of the most extraordinary families in Suiyuan and Mongolia. The purpose of this reporter is to use the Qi surname power family of Yangjiawan and the young Commander Qi Zhizhong to recount the past political inside story of the Mongol Banners and explain the path that the Mongol Banners will take in the future.

Qi Zhizhong's family began to rise to prominence with his grandfather, Nasan Dalai. Although Nasan was a direct descendant of Genghis Khan, he initially held no official position and belonged to a kind of idle prince who lived off his family's wealth. Therefore, he was very poor in his youth and had to serve as a soldier for the Zasag. Later, because Nasan was tall and brave in battle, he gained military power. During the era of Prince Ka, the grandfather of Qi Zhiguo, the Zasag of Jungar Banner who died of illness the year before last, he became the hereditary Zhenguo Duke Taiji and served as the most powerful Eastern Councilor of Jungar Banner. Therefore, the people in the border area between Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan called him "Lord Nasan," "Great Han Taiji," or "Great Han Official." After the death of Qi Zhiguo's father, Prince A, Nasan, as the Eastern Councilor, even took charge of the Zasag's seals, holding power from the 34th year of the Guangxu reign until the first month of the lunar calendar in the 21st year of the Republic (1932).

Major General Qi Zhizhong

After Nasan seized military and political power, he ushered in a new era for Jungar Banner. He carried out construction work in the three areas of military affairs, politics, and economy, showing more progressive style than the hereditary Zasag. Because Jungar Banner was separated from the two provinces of Qin (Shaanxi) and Jin (Shanxi) only by the Great Wall and the Yellow River, the Mongol people were completely Sinicized, allowing Nasan to invite impoverished scholars and frustrated military officers from Hequ and Fugou to reform the old policies, train new armies, and gain a leading position in the Yeke-juu League. Nasan's first wife was a Manchu lady. She open-mindedly allowed her son Qi Zijun to study in Beiping. Later, he graduated from Peking University and went to Kulun to study. When he returned, he asked the lamas of various temples to create a school to cultivate Mongol and Han children in the banner. At the same time, Shini Lama of Uushin Banner and Zhang Wenxuan of Otog Banner, who went to Outer Mongolia for training, were regarded as dangerous figures in the Yeke-juu League by the feudal princes.

Qi Zijun and his son made many welfare contributions to the border area between Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan during their lifetimes. In the early years of the Xuantong reign, there was a severe drought in northern Shaanxi. Nasan Dalai allocated 50,000 taels of silver for disaster relief and subsidized famine victims from Fugou and Shenmu to reclaim wasteland in Jungar Banner. This move not only increased the population of Jungar Banner by more than 100,000 but also created a landlord with 500 li of narrow land from Fugou to Salachi County. Therefore, during the Anti-Japanese War, Yangjiawan was able to supply General Ma Zhanshan's cavalry for as long as six years. After the Revolution of 1911, the world was in chaos. Nasan Dalai suppressed Su Yusheng's bandit gang that roamed in Hequ and Fugou. In 1927, Wang Ying, a bandit sent by the Fengtian warlords, feigned a passage through Jungar Banner to attack Hequ, Shanxi. Qi Zijun automatically set fire to Yangjiawan, creating a scorched earth. From then on, the bandits dared not enter the border of Jungar Banner again.

Nasan Dalai's many practices were deeply supported by the people but opposed by other officials. In order to achieve unification, he massacred many traitors in the banner, leaving behind the roots of hatred. At that time, a banner administrator named Altan Vazir strongly opposed Nasan. He was arrested by Nasan and died in prison. His son, Qi Shoushan, went to the Central Military Academy for training. After graduating, he did not dare to return to the banner and worked in the Military Training Department. In 1929, Qi Zijun, as a member of the National Government Supervisory Committee, went to Nanjing for a meeting. With a broad mind, he brought Qi Shoushan back to Jungar Banner. Nasan asked Qi Shoushan to train soldiers and Qi Zijun to govern, and he opened the four towns of Shagedu, Nalin, Wuzhiwan, and Nuanshui into commercial ports, giving Qi Shoushan a lot of property, wanting to build Jungar Banner into a model Mongol banner. Unexpectedly, Qi Shoushan, incited by opposing figures in the banner, killed Qi Zijun and his son on the first day of the first month of the 21st year (1932) when he came to Yangjiawan to pay New Year's greetings, claiming to avenge his father, thus thwarting Nasan Dalai's heroic ambitions.

Nasan Dalai's Portrait

After Qi Shoushan killed Qi Zijun and his son, Erjubaigan, Nasan Dalai's battalion commander (who was assassinated last year), killed Qi Shoushan and replaced Nasan Dalai's military and political position. Qi Wenying and his grandson Qi Yongquan served as Eastern and Western Councilors, respectively. In addition to managing the Zasag's seals, Qi Wenying also held the two military seals of the Jungar Banner Security Commander and the First Guerrilla District Commander of Mongolia, with even greater power than Nasan Dalai. Qi Zhizhong, the successor of Qi Zijun and his son, was only twelve years old after his grandfather and uncle were killed. Qi Wenying took Nasan Dalai's army to Shenchu (Qi Wenying's residence), leaving only a group of home guards to guard the fields in Yangjiawan. After Qi Zhizhong was raised and educated by his grandmother, he used his own property to recruit troops and horses, and by the time the Anti-Japanese War began, he had expanded into a regiment of strong cavalry in six or seven years.

This offspring of a noble family first appeared on the political stage of Jungar Banner on the day he assisted Qi Zhiguo, the son of Prince A, in using his seal. After Prince A died of illness, his son's seal affairs had been managed by Nasan Dalai and Qi Wenying. By 1941, Qi Zhiguo had reached the legal age for his title and was very handsome and promising. However, Qi Wenying was unwilling to hand over the seal, so Qi Zhiguo united Qi Zhizhong of Yangjiawan and Qi Shangbin (the current Eastern Councilor of Jungar Banner), the grandson of Danpianer, the Eastern Councilor of Prince Ka who was killed by General Yigu during the Qianlong reign, and other young people. After Ma Zhanshan sent troops to suppress the situation, he transferred the Jungar royal seal from Shenshan to the Deshengxi palace. From then on, Qi Zhizhong became a pillar of the new regime of Jungar Banner, and Qi Wenying of Shenshan formed two new forces in Jungar Banner. Before Japan surrendered, Qi Zhiguo died of illness. Qi Zhizhong led his troops away from Deshengxi to assist General Ma Zhanshan in defending Hequ, and together with Qi Shangbin of Nanping, Qi Wenying divided Jungar Banner into two regions, east and west. After Japan surrendered, General Ma Zhanshan led his troops away from the Yeke-juu League, leaving him many cadres and weapons. The strength of Yangjiawan became even more prosperous.

Last summer, Qi Wenying was assassinated by assassins sent by Qi Zixiang, the nephew of Qi Fengming, the former Western Councilor of his grandson Qi Yongquan. Qi Zhizhong immediately sent troops from Yangjiawan to disarm the rebel army, so that the entire banner did not experience any disturbances. The provincial government immediately announced that he would succeed Qi Wenying as the Jungar Banner Security Commander. Later, the Banner Affairs Committee was established, with Qi Yongquan, Qi Wenying's grandson, serving as the chairman, and Qi Zhizhong concurrently serving as a member and head of the finance section. The Banner Affairs Committee replaced the former royal palace. Because Qi Zhizhong had the masses and wealth, he had a strong political capital, so now Yangjiawan has become the center of military affairs, politics, and wealth on the border area between Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan. This year, in addition to sending troops to recover Fugou, Qi Zhizhong also carried out a task of eradicating feudal forces. The facts of the matter are as follows: After Qi Wenying was assassinated, the Banner Affairs Committee established in Jungar Banner was opposed by the princes of various banners of the Yeke-juu League. Without the permission of the provincial government, the King directly recommended Qi Shangbin, the grandson of Danpianer Taiji, to the central government to succeed Qi Wenying as the Eastern Councilor of Jungar Banner, and recommended Qi Fuhai, a close relative of Qi Zhiguo, as the Zasag. In order to overthrow the princely system, Qi Zhizhong took advantage of Qi Shangbin's trip to the Junwang Banner in May of this year and completely resolved Qi Shangbin's army with lightning speed, trapping Qi Shangbin and Qi Fuhai in Guisui, and they have not been able to return to the Deshengxi palace to take over the seals.

Qi Zijun's Portrait

With the Communist bandits constantly encroaching on the northern border, the position of Commander Qi Zhizhong is becoming increasingly important. There are now four major groups in Jungar Banner. In addition to Qi Zhizhong of Yangjiawan, there is Qi Yongquan of Shenshan, Qi Zhiguo's mother in Deshengxi, Qi Fuhai and Qi Shangbin, who are exiled in Guisui, and Qi Zixiang of the Qi Zixiang, one of the three sons of the Hetao gang of Jungar Banner. Qi Yongquan is currently the Chairman of the Banner Affairs Committee and holds the three cavalry regiments left by his grandfather Qi Wenying, which have been reorganized into the First Border Defense District Commander. However, his prestige is not as good as Qi Zhizhong's, his wealth is not as good as Qi Zhizhong's, and his cadres are not as strong as Qi Zhizhong's. Therefore, the mother of Zasag Qi Zhiguo only has a household army. Qi Fuhai, the puppet prince who attempts to rule from behind the curtain, and the regent Qi Shangbin are temporarily unable to return to the banner, and the regimental commander Hao Deming has a very close relationship with Qi Zhizhong. Qi Zixiang was arrested and released in the Qi Wenying case and is currently leading troops to suppress bandits in Chahar Province, unable to return to the banner to intervene in internal affairs. Therefore, the governance of Jungar Banner and the safety of the border area between Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan in the future will depend greatly on the decisive role of Qi Zhizhong.

Although Commander Qi Zhizhong is a Mongol, he does not understand the Mongol language and speaks a mixture of Han Chinese from Hequ and Fugou counties. He has not attended modern schools, but he has a good foundation in the Four Books and Five Classics, and his conversation is very elegant. Due to reading newspapers, he is quite knowledgeable. Qi Zhizhong has the bearing of a noble offspring. He said, "I only believe in two people, Chairman Jiang and Chief Fu. I also listen to the words of the elders of General Ma." He believes that the mutual killing in Jungar Banner is the biggest trauma to the Mongol banners, and the only way to avoid it in the future is to implement democracy. He said, "Now the central government is constantly implementing constitutional government, why does it still allow the princely system to exist in the Mongol banners? It really makes it impossible for us to explain." Speaking of the issue of Inner Mongolia's autonomy, Commander Qi Zhizhong said affirmatively: "We have already implemented autonomy, what is lacking now is progress." (Reporter Liu Yingyuan)

### Giant Plane Crashes, Sounding Like Thunder

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Kaifeng, November 13] Yesterday at around 10:00 AM, a huge sound like thunder was suddenly heard west of the city, shaking the roofs and tiles. It has been learned that a large transport plane suddenly crashed and burned near Hanzhuang Station, west of Kaifeng on the Longhai Railway, and a violent explosion occurred.

Another report: In the middle of the previous ten-day period, the Pinghan Railway was destroyed by bandits, resulting in heavy losses of railway equipment. In addition to ticket cars, freight cars, and all equipment, 20 locomotives have been destroyed, including three that transferred from the Longhai Railway. These were newly purchased from the United States.

### Zhengzhou Hawker Incident Likely to Be Resolved Quickly

[Report from our Zhengzhou correspondent on the 14th] Due to the authorities' attention to public order and traffic issues in Zhengzhou, a hawker incident has recently occurred. Near Changchun Road, there is a small market that serves as a gathering place for hawkers. Currently, the Zhenxing Commercial Market is being established near Qiantang Road. In order to beautify the city and facilitate management, the authorities ordered the hawkers from the small market to move to the Zhenxing Commercial Market. The hawkers there have petitioned the garrison headquarters, police station, and other agencies eight times, requesting permission to operate in the open space near the small market. Their reasons are: The distance between the small market and the Zhenxing Commercial Market is five or six *li*. Since they are located near the small market, moving back and forth every day would be time-consuming and costly. There are currently more than 600 hawker households in the small market, while the Zhenxing Commercial Market can only accommodate more than 400 households. Furthermore, the rental prices in the Zhenxing Commercial Market are too expensive for the hawkers to afford. It is said that most of the hawkers there are old refugees from northern Henan. When the Japanese invaded northern Henan, they fled to the Jieshou area to make a living, and have now gradually come to Zhengzhou for one or two years, and their situation is indeed quite difficult. The authorities seem to have considered changing their handling methods for this issue, and this incident may be resolved peacefully.

### Jiangyin Seizes Stored Grain, Bans Hoarding and Profiteering

[Report from our Jiangyin correspondent on the 17th] This county has always been known as a rice-producing area, but recently rice prices have been even higher than in Shanghai and Wuxi. *Bai geng* rice has reached 1.45 million [currency unit], and the common people are constantly complaining. The county government convened a meeting of grain merchants on the 16th, and as a result, they decided to seal up the stored grain in various villages, ban hoarding and profiteering. The guild has set the price of *zhong bai geng hai shi* rice at 1.35 million [currency unit], and secondary rice at 1.3 million [currency unit], with a limit of one *dou* for door-to-door sales.

### The "Omnipotent Lens" - A Glimpse of the Criminal Investigation Laboratory's Equipment

[Report from our Nanjing correspondent on the 12th] In modern times, criminals are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their techniques. The authorities must rely on scientific equipment and technological coordination in order to collect and identify criminal evidence and achieve the task of maintaining social stability. During this period of suppressing rebellion, building the nation, and eradicating opium, the responsibility of the criminal police is even more onerous. The Criminal Police Headquarters of the Ministry of Interior is located in Nanjing, and is setting an example for police work nationwide in terms of equipment, personnel, and organization. The headquarters has taken over various equipment from the Sino-American Cooperative Organization and established a criminal laboratory, which is divided into ten groups: chemistry, fingerprinting, photography, forensic medicine, technology, electrical, firearms examination, supply, police dogs, and carrier pigeons. All the instruments are of considerable value. This newspaper has previously introduced them in an article. In order to give readers a better understanding of their contents, we are now publishing a collection of photographs taken by the World Photography News Agency as follows:

Models: The application of models in criminology is to supplement the shortcomings of photography in identifying or investigating criminal evidence.

Lie Detector: Based on the psychological reaction of the electrical charge in the human body. When used, the polygraph operator first discusses the questions. Then, the respiration belt and pulse tester are tied to the subject's left arm, and the skin resistance tester is placed on the palm of the left hand. Then, the subject is instructed to sit properly. The testing method is divided into two types, which must be used together: one is a controlled test, and the other is a test of questions related to the case. The average percentage of its effectiveness depends on the experience and knowledge of the polygraph operator, usually above 75%.

"Omnipotent Lens": This instrument is produced by the German WELTE factory. Its structure is divided into four parts: slicing, microscopic, comparative, and photomicrography. It can inspect transparent and opaque objects and is an important tool for criminal identification.

Two-Way Radio Telephone and Telegraph: This machine can be used to transmit and receive radio telephone and telegraph messages, and is specially used for communication, liaison, and command. The communication distance can reach tens of *hua li*.

Burglar Alarm: Used for burglar alarms and security. The electrical device of the alarm bell is used to control its shutter button, which can simultaneously take photos to provide evidence of people passing through the security line.

Diesel Generator: Specially used for supplying electricity for theé‰´å®š work of various instruments, so it is called a power control machine.

### One Dance Captivates, A Second Dance Seals the Deal: "Hero and Beauty" in Yangzhou â€“ Both Arrested and Taken to the County Office

[Report from our Yangzhou correspondent on the 14th] A case of impersonating a military officer occurred here a few days ago. Because the incident was bizarre, it quickly spread far and wide, causing a city-wide sensation. Recently, a handsome young man wearing a military uniform and the insignia of a major general was often seen strolling the streets of Yangzhou with a heavily made-up young woman. Especially in teahouses and restaurants, the guests all cast envious glances at this dazzling "major general." However, time flies quickly, and more than ten days have passed, but this "hero and beauty" are still leisurely wandering the streets, doing nothing, which has attracted the attention of the police. It was found that the "major general" was named Wang Huanwen, 28 years old, from Weixian County, Shandong Province, and the woman was "Mrs." Wan, named Chen Liping, living together at No. 11, Jiuhao, in the old city. Unexpectedly, Wang "major general" was bored after eating his fill all day, so he often invited nearby laborers to visit Zhucheng [a local pleasure district], wearing a starched military uniform and enjoying himself at the same table as those who were barefoot and naked, fully demonstrating his "democratic style" and "military-civilian cooperation." After the police station obtained this information, Officer Cheng resolutely joined the game. During the chat, he saw through the trick in Wang "major general"'s sleeve. The next day, when investigating household registrations, he found two forged travel certificates from the Second Pacification Zone Headquarters, an identity card, four private seals of Commander Wang Yaowu, two Victory Medals, and twenty rounds of ammunition for a rifle in his bedroom. At this point, the secret was revealed, and Wang "major general" and Chen Liping were "escorted" to the police station. After interrogation, Wang Huanwen confessed that he was also known as "Wang Hui" and "Sheng Bin," and did not deny the forgery of documents and the Wang Yaowu private seals. He also said that he had already issued two forged documents and traveled between Nanjing and Shanghai in the past, and had recently come to Yangzhou with his wife for a short stay. According to Chen Liping's confession, she used to be a dancer at the MGM dance hall in Shanghai. Because she was captivated by Wang's elegance, one dance captivated her, and a second dance sealed the deal. She began living with Wang in the tenth month of the lunar calendar and was unaware of Wang's identity and family background. Her current life depends entirely on his selling gold jewelry. When she spoke, her eyebrows were furrowed, as if she was overwhelmed by the regret of her misstep. After obtaining the confessions, the police station, fearing that the case involved other suspects, transferred the "hero and beauty" to the county government for investigation and detention, and they will soon be tasting the flavor of iron bars.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Stipulates Measures to Stabilize Grain Prices

[Report from our Zhenjiang correspondent on the 17th] Recently, in order to solve the people's food problems and stabilize the people's hearts, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, in addition to suggesting that the central government quickly seek countermeasures, has specially formulated measures to stabilize grain prices as follows: Strictly enforce the "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Crimes Against Grain Price Management in Extraordinary Times." When necessary, the grain stored in each county and city will be subject to price requisition of surplus grain in accordance with the provisions of the regulations, and grain merchants will be advised to sell surplus grain on the market. Strictly control the grain market and strictly investigate and ban grain merchants from transacting grain. Strictly register the entry and exit of rice, and for those who purchase rice in large quantities, the purpose and destination should be investigated. Guide idle funds into production industries to avoid disturbing the grain market. The relevant counties and cities have been ordered to strictly follow these measures.

### Overseas Chinese in Cuba: From Servants to Leaders

[Report from our Cuba correspondent on the 13th] Minister Mei Jingzhou recently wrote an article describing the great achievements of overseas Chinese in Cuba, which was published in the *China World Daily* of Havana and has attracted the attention of readers. The full text is translated as follows: It has been a full century since Chinese people came to live in Cuba. They were very poor at first and worked hard. They also fought for freedom. From farmhands to wealthy merchants, their rapid progress is amazing.

When Chinese people first arrived in Cuba, they worked as servants. The locals called them Chinese from Little Luzon, because they all came from that place. Only a few had experience in farming. At that time, agriculture in the Philippines was not very developed, and the trade in African black slaves was more profitable. These Chinese people had already learned Spanish and were largely assimilated into Spanish culture. The second wave of immigrants were from Fujian, who were recruited by Spaniards from Little Luzon, mostly "Hakka." They were regarded as non-native people in their hometowns, and were eager to go abroad due to oppression. A small number of them were Christians. From 1847 onwards, this continued for ten years. We Chinese people are all good workers, and were exploited by the Spanish. The immigration of Chinese workers to Cuba from 1847 to 1877 lasted for thirty years. After the prohibition of the black slave trade, they were transported here to replace them.

Wahluwitt wrote: "Since there was a shortage of workers, it was necessary to find workers to replace the black slaves. Therefore, unscrupulous merchants thought of transporting Chinese people under the guise of hired laborers. Thus, black slaves were transformed into Chinese slaves, and the inhuman treatment they received was even worse." In order to prevent the Chinese from regaining their freedom after their contracts expired, the Spanish made them sign contracts voluntarily relinquishing their rights.

Chinese people are naturally able to work hard in difficult circumstances, which is also the root of trouble. The famous author Quiros found that black people often died from working in the vast tobacco, sugar, and cotton plantations, while Chinese people could thrive in the harsh tropical environment. This unfortunate environment made them yearn for liberation and a thorough improvement in political and social aspects. Therefore, during the Cuban independence movement, they showed remarkable achievements.

Many Chinese people were abducted and sold in Macau, falsely told that they were being transported to Little Luzon, but in fact they were sent to Greater Luzon (the collective name for Spain and its colonies). The voyage across the Pacific Ocean was quite long, and riots and plagues often occurred on board. Sometimes only 30% of them were able to reach their destination. If 50% survived, it was considered a smooth voyage. They were paid eight yuan a month, and had to pay for their own passage and food along the way.

The situation in Cuba at that time was even more terrifying. When they arrived, it was during General Otoniel's social unrest and dictatorship. After landing, they were sent to Yunton Province to build new sugar mills. Most of them were considered "tools".

The Sino-Spanish Agreement was thought to be a way to improve the situation. The Spanish consul in Guangzhou and Macau, Saint Wilnouwa, worked hard to draft the charter. Subsequently, other amended charters were introduced, such as the 1861 decree, which was the result of the efforts of the Chinese residing in Cuba. From the start of the Cuban Revolution on October 10, 1868, until the First War of Independence, bribery in the colony reached its peak. General Turusi wanted to stop it, but was forced to resign. During General Roja's tenure, there was even more speculation, and even contracts for Chinese workers were traded. The Chinese government lodged a strong protest. During the tenure of Count Palumasitta, the Chinese who were forced to work in fortifications in Hugaro and Mauron rose up in resistance and joined the revolutionary army. Other Chinese fled into the forests. They often appeared in the wars in CamagÃ¼ey, eastern provinces, Las Villas, and Yunton. As a result, the Chinese who remained working in the forts were even more abused. Because the Chinese participated in the 1873 war and were exploited, the Qing Dynasty sent the famous Chen Lanbin to negotiate in Cuba (1874). The only impression Chen left on Havana was his personal prominence and demeanor. Ladu described in his "Essentials of the History of Chinese People in Cuba" how Chen was warmly received and won the hearts of the Cuban people. Chen's achievements in alleviating the suffering of overseas Chinese were very limited, but the Madrid Treaty was initiated as a result, so Chen's trip was not without merit (Cuba, Havana). The Cuban side has many detailed records of the achievements of overseas Chinese in participating in the Ten Years' War. Kesada wrote in his book "Chinese People and Cuban Independence," "Among the Chinese soldiers, there were no spies or deserters." This book has recently been reprinted.

The participation of the Chinese in the war was so important that when the Cubans surrendered to the Spanish on February 10, 1878, they demanded the addition of a clause that would allow the Chinese to enjoy the rights of amnesty and liberation, which was finally approved. Later, during Blanco's tenure, the Chinese Consulate in Havana was established and regulations were promulgated to abolish the labor contracts. These Chinese then engaged in commerce and the cultivation of sugarcane and fruits. When the war broke out in 1895, the overseas Chinese joined the army again to help Cuba fight for freedom. Those who are immortalized in the history of the War of Independence include Colonel Hu and Colonel Laihua, who are highly respected by the Cuban people. After this war, Cuba became an independent republic. The overseas Chinese joined forces to participate in the Cuban reconstruction work. Many of them had ample savings, but lost everything during these difficult times, and could not return to their home country, so they settled here. Today, they lead in many industries. The economic and social status of our Chinese people is steadily increasing and becoming more prosperous. Some of their descendants have even held important positions in the Cuban government. Their academic achievements are even better than their ancestors, and they are able to contribute to the development of Cuba's future and the promotion of friendship between China and Cuba. In short, the history of Chinese people in Cuba is 100 years long. The most outstanding point is their transformation from farmhands to wealthy merchants. Despite the difficulties of language, culture, environment, and ethnicity, our Chinese people were able to overcome difficulties with gentleness, accept adversity with grace, endure hardship, and strive hard, and finally achieve victory. From farmers and workers to merchants, and from merchants to leaders, this three-stage process is a process of valuable contributions made by our Chinese people to Cuba. (Pei Mei)

### Bizarre Fetus in Beiping - Gestated for Twelve Years

[Report from our Beiping correspondent on the 15th] The Beiping Municipal Hospital previously treated a woman for uterine fibroids and performed surgery on the 7th of this month. They discovered a hard, bizarre object adhering to the patient's colon above her uterus. After detailed examination, they determined it to be an underdeveloped four-month-old fetus. After the news spread, a reporter visited a certain doctor, the director of obstetrics at the hospital, who agreed to show the entire bizarre fetus (as shown in the picture). The head is 7 cm in diameter, the total length is 14 cm, and the limbs, spine, and ribs are faintly visible. The whole body is cyanotic and purple. There are still several strands of hair on the skull, and it has been gestating for twelve years. The bizarre fetus has already become petrified.

After X-ray examination, the internal skeletal structure of the bizarre fetus was found to be very complete.

### Eastern European Inside Story

â€” Sapei Keng

[Special Dispatch from our London Correspondent] The "unhappy ending" of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in London reflects the contradictions between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union on the European continent. Control of the Eastern European countries is the Soviet Union's advanced base for intervening in Germany and Austria and concerning France and Italy, as well as one of the Soviet Union's important assets in participating in world politics. These so-called Eastern European countries mainly include Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, which are usually considered to be countries within the Soviet Union's "Iron Curtain." Since they have the nickname "Iron Curtain," it is conceivable that they are not easy to understand. However, the outer edge of the "Iron Curtain" is ultimately different from the core of the "Iron Curtain." Therefore, we can still know something, and it is very necessary to know something today.

Let's start with Yugoslavia and Bulgaria: since the beginning of this year (1947), the governments of both countries have been under the control of the Communist Party, and the opposition parties have no power to speak of. The main policies of the governments of the two countries under the control of the Communist Party are how to eliminate the remaining elements of the opposition party and how to isolate the people of their own country from contact with foreigners (the so-called foreign countries here naturally refer to countries not controlled by the Communist Party). According to this policy, it is natural to greatly increase the use of prisons. To give the main examples, in Yugoslavia, Professor Fang Lan, a liberal, was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Yefenfei was sentenced to nine years in prison; in Bulgaria, such as the execution of Bokov and the life imprisonment of Stankiv. These prison sentences were generally due to these people's usual contacts with Western European people, or criticism of communism in parliamentary speeches or private conversations.

The situation in Romania is similar. Although the government is of a "united" nature, the Peasant Party, as the opposition party in the government, is not only oppressed, but its leaders, including Meng Niu, who was arrested not long ago, have been sentenced to long-term imprisonment. The other two parties participating in the coalition governmentâ€”the Socialist Party and the Liberal Partyâ€”have been purged because their opinions differ from those of the Communist Party. The Socialist Party was forced to merge with other "workers' parties," while the Liberal Party was forced to withdraw from the government by a vote of no confidence in the parliament.

The situation in Poland and Hungary is slightly different from the above three countries in degree. The leader of the Polish Peasant Party, Mikolajczyk, recently fled to England and has gone to the United States, and a dozen other people have been arrested. However, the Polish Socialist Party, which participates in the Polish government, is still struggling to maintain its "independence" and has not merged with other parties. Hungary is also considered by the Communist Party to be somewhat short of "true democracy." The Smallholder's Party, which is quite powerful in Hungary, is now in fact under the control of the Communist Party. However, there are still three parties in the Hungarian coalition government, occupying about one-third of the seats in parliament, which are considered right-leaning. One of them, the "Hungarian Independence Party," has been suppressed, and its leader, Feifei, has also left the country. In the Polish government, the Socialist Party is still supporting its nominal "independence." Its leader, Szakasit, recently gave a speech against merging with other parties, but how long he can support it is also a question.

The most important country is Czechoslovakia, which is probably the country with the greatest political freedom and the gradual restoration of the rule of law among the Eastern European countries, and the degree to which it is controlled by the Communist Party is also slightly less. However, in July of this year, the Czechoslovak government was in fact forced to abandon the invitation to the Paris Conference at the last second. Since then, the Communist Party and its "fellow travelers" have been strengthening their efforts to force the Czechoslovak government to the left. The five-year plan announced by the Czechoslovak government in October is an economic transformation to sever Czechoslovakia's relations with Western countries. The current strategy of the Communist Party seems to be how to occupy a majority in the parliament in order to overthrow the parties of the National Front that have been in Czechoslovakia since the end of the war.

As mentioned above, it can be seen that the situation in the Eastern European countries can be roughly divided into two parts: one part is Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Romania. These three countries are in fact one-party dictatorship countries, that is, countries controlled by the Communist Party. The other part is Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. Although these three countries are threatened by the Communist Party, they can still contact Western European countries at present. However, this situation is only superficial and may be short-lived, because the actual power of the Communist Party can be controlled. Due to Czechoslovakia's refusal to participate in the Paris Conference (it initially agreed to participate but was forced to refuse temporarily), the Polish Peasant Party leader's escape (this would not be necessary in a truly democratic country), and the Hungarian Independence Party leader's departure from the country, it is conceivable. As for when the Communist Party will organize a one-party government in these countries, it probably depends on their assessment of the international situation, which is a matter of the Communist Party's strategy. Of course, there is also a possibility here, that is, to overcome the current crisis with the national consciousness of the people of Czechoslovakia and Poland, but today, the power of this possibility is very difficult to estimate.

All research related to "life" and "physiological" theories belongs to the scope of biology. In the future, biology teachers should understand four points: Firmly adhere to their own positions. China needs a biology textbook that forms its own system, from bottom to top, and is suitable for the needs of domestic agriculture, medicine, and all aspects of society. When teaching biology, one should have a scientific and truthful spirit and correct all distortions that have an effect, such as when Hitler used German biologists to advocate the theory of national excellence and exclude Jews based on the theory of "survival of the fittest" and launched a war. We must be vigilant against such distortions. When studying biology, special attention should be paid to experimental research. Techniques such as microscopes, microtomes, and drawing should be earnestly learned. It must be known that all book theories are based on experiments. The future development of agriculture in China has much to do with biological research. Often explain to young students the relationship between biology and real life.

### The Yiyuan All-Star Game Ends in a Tie; The Second Inter-Port Football Test Match Ends in a 1-1 Draw

[Our Newspaper] The weather was warm, and all the heroes gathered at Yiyuan Stadium yesterday afternoon. The football representatives selected for the inter-port match held the second test match. Thirty Chinese and Western players appeared on the field, still divided into blue and white teams. The result was a 1-1 draw, and the victory was not divided. There was no record in the first half. Eight or nine thousand fans attended, making it a grand occasion.

Blue Attacks, White Defends

The lineup of the blue and white teams was arranged with the blue team attacking more than defending and the white team defending more than attacking. The first half was tense and exciting, but the movement became scattered after the changes in the second half. The blue team's forwards, led by the blonde Robert Stoffer, were extremely active, forcing the white team's defenders and center backs to retreat to defend, resulting in a battle of blue attack and white defense. As a result, the white team's center backs and forwards were disconnected, and with Luo Shoufu's weakness, the white team's forwards seemed to have difficulty developing. Among the blue team's defenders, the center back line was quite good, and Tievoni was able to stand alone.

No Score Recorded in the First Half

White Team: Zhang Banglun, Chen Jiawan, Wu Qixiang, Hannibal, Qu Yongfu, Gao Baozheng, Carlo Lieque, Luo Shoufu, Han Longhai, Li Yishen, Chen Mingzhe

Blue Team: Qin Bigao, F. Hertz, Zhang Lingen, Edward, Tievoni, Murray He, Jin Lusheng, Robert Stoffer, Xia Tixian, Fei Chunhua

Referee: Zhang Le; Linesmen: Wu Shouheng, Deng Xiaoliang. The white team wore the red jerseys of the Donghua Association, and the blue team wore the cyan-white jerseys of the Qingbai Association. The lineup was as above, and the game began with the whistle. The blue team attacked first. After three minutes, Xia Tixian got the ball and shot, but Zhang Banglun missed. Just as Little Huangmao was about to kick, Chen Jiawan cleared the ball and saved it. Not long after, Jin Lusheng shot from the left corner, but it flew into the sky. After twelve minutes, Chen Mingzhe cut in from the right corner of the white team, and the ball landed in front of the blue team's goal, but Carlo Lieque was one step late. Carlo Lieque returned and passed to the center, and Longhai headed the ball, but Tai Bigao hugged it. In the melee until the 30th minute, Edward of the blue team was near the 20-yard area outside the goal. Li Yishen took the free kick, but it did not work. Chen Mingzhe knocked on the door again, but Qin Bigao was waiting for him. Xia Tixian of the blue team shot fiercely in front of the white team's goal, but it bounced off the crossbar. The first half ended with a double zero.

1-1 Draw in the Second Half

Changing sides and fighting again, the lineups of the two teams changed, arranged as follows:

Blue Team: Qin Bigao, Hertz, F. Grifi Ke, Edward, Qian Changrong, Tievoni, Murray He, Luo Shoufu, Robert Stoffer

White Team: Zhang Banglun, Risberg, Chen Jiawan, Li Yishen, Hannibal, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng, Carlo Lieque, Grina Si, Gao Xiuqing

The white team attacked first. The two teams went back and forth and fought for a long time. After twelve minutes, Xia Tixian was extremely active, and with a fierce shot, he broke the white team's goal first. The white team counterattacked with all its strength. After two minutes, Qian Changrong hand-kissed the ball in the penalty area. Li Yishen sent a light 12-yard penalty, but it was just in Qin Bigao's arms and failed to succeed. At the 17th minute, Chen Jiawan left the field due to a foot injury, and Risberg replaced him, and Li Yishen moved to the left. After that, the battle became more intense. In the 33rd minute, Gao Baozheng injured his foot again, and Lu Bingsheng replaced him. Qian Changrong of the blue team retired, and Tievoni became a midwife again. Seven minutes before the end of the game, Grina Si scored with a long shot, and the white team tied the score 1-1. The silver horn sounded, and each rice divided the victory.

### Yonghe Cup Rubber Ball Tournament Successfully Concludes: Limin Defeats Anyuan to Win Championship

Yesterday, Limin defeated Anyuan 3-2 in the third overtime period to win the overall championship of the inaugural Yonghe Cup Rubber Ball League. Superintendent Hao Gengsheng kicked off the match yesterday, and the audience reached 5,000 people. Firecrackers went off from all sides, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. Limin scored the first two goals, but Anyuan tied the game at 2-2 in the second half. After referee Chen Liangchen called for three overtimes, the winner was finally decided. After the match, Superintendent Hao was invited to present the awards and give a speech. Finally, Ye Qieruo and Ye Yiruo, the two assistant managers of Yonghe Industrial Company, encouraged the teams to continue their efforts. Everyone then took a group photo and dispersed happily. The cup tournament thus came to an end. The deposit will be returned to each team upon presentation of the receipt immediately (forfeited by those who forfeited).

Limin: Tang Junming, Xu Zizhi, Ma Fugen, Zhang Zhimei, Weng Chuanlong, Ha Zengguang, Chen Qiaosheng

### Dagong Suffers First Waterloo: Chenyou Wins by One Point: Surprise Upset in Basketball League Last Night

[Reported by this newspaper] The Chenyou basketball team created a surprise upset in last night's basketball league, defeating the perennial champion Dagong team by a valuable one point, with a final score of 51-50. In the first half, Chenyou was behind by four points, 25-29. Over a thousand fans were astonished. Chenyou, young and strong, worked hard in training. Their performance last night was indeed very impressive. They previously lost to Wulian by one point, but yesterday they defeated Dagong by one point, which does not seem to be accidental. Wang Bingfu's shots were excellent, hitting the mark with ease, like a divine assistant. Dagong was perhaps a little overconfident and found themselves in a tough battle. They were overly nervous, their performance was abnormal, and they ultimately suffered a crushing defeat, which is deeply regrettable.

Liu Hesheng and Jin Bowen officiated. Chenyou's Wang Bingfu opened the scoring. Dagong's Shi Wei took the lead with 11-2. Chenyou counterattacked and gradually closed the gap. The situation was extremely tense. At the end of the first half, Chenyou was still behind by four points, 25-29.

Resuming play, Dagong's lineup remained unchanged. Chenyou brought in Ji Youkun, replaced Wang Rongsheng, and Jiu Quan made the first basket. Wenzhang immediately responded. Chenyou's He Zengling made a basket in the air, tying the score at 31-31. Dagong calmly coped, but the situation was extremely tense, and the scores went up and down, with each team vying for the lead. Chenyou's Little Wang shot accurately from afar, scoring repeatedly. At 47-41, Dagong was in a tough battle and called a timeout four times to discuss countermeasures. At 51-45, Dagong called for a timeout for the fifth time. Wenlong scored on a free throw, Wenhua scored from afar, and Zhongqiang broke through to score, 51-50, closing the gap to just half a point. With tens of seconds left before the end of the game, Dagong was overly nervous, and Chenyou called a timeout for the sixth time. During the free throws, Wenzhang and Wenhua both missed. Otherwise, they could have tied the score and still had a chance. Before long, time ran out, and Chenyou won by 51-50, by one point.

The other two games last night: Qianxian defeated Qingqiu (Women's), 47-26; Jianle defeated Tongren (B-2), 66-37.

### Selecting Representatives for Inter-City Football Match: Final Trials This Week, Blue and White Teams to Face Off Again on Sunday

After two trial matches for the city's inter-city football team, the selection committee members Rong Qizhao, Yu Hengzhi, Wang Xinheng, and Tan Jing held a meeting at the Meixin Restaurant last night. Because there were many candidates and the two trial matches were not enough to showcase their skills, it was decided to hold a final trial match this weekend (the 25th), after which the official representatives would be selected. The lineups for the blue and white teams were also arranged on the spot as follows:

Blue Team: Zhang Banglun, Li Yichen, Wu Qixiang, Hannibo, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng, Jin Lusheng, Sun Jinshun (Captain), Robert Stoff, Xia Tixian, Fei Chunhua

White Team: Xu Fusheng, Chen Jiawan, Xu Erz, Edward Qu Yongfu, McLeroth, Li Yao, Grinas, Han Longhai (Captain), Lu Qingxiang, Carlolequi

(Reserves): Qin Bigao, Griffiths, Lesburg, Lu Bingsheng, Tiffeni, Run Xiuqing, Chen Ming

### Amidst Tightening Credit, Check Returns Increase Again: Authorities Continue Thorough Investigation of Financial Management

Amidst tightening credit, the number of returned checks has increased again recently. Financial management authorities continue to send personnel to conduct thorough investigations of returned checks. It is understood that the authorities have decided to implement the "Measures to Strengthen Financial Business Management." If the amount of returned checks from a commercial bank or money shop at the clearing house exceeds 5% of the total amount cleared by that bank or money shop on that day for three consecutive times, and it is found that the returned checks are clearly used as an excuse to balance the clearing difference, the local financial management agency may set a time limit to order the adjustment of the position. Additionally, local banks and money shops will be ordered to suspend lending to the bank within the time limit.

### Banks and Money Shops Should Report Loan and Remittance Amounts to the Financial Management Bureau

[Reported by this newspaper] The Financial Management Bureau of the Ministry of Finance in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and other four locations has been established successively. In addition to the monthly statements and loan target classifications that commercial banks, trust companies, and provincial and municipal banks are required to prepare at the end of each month, it is learned that the Ministry of Finance has separately ordered a remittance report form to be created, starting in January 1948, to be submitted to the respective management bureaus for verification. The external business units of all state-owned banks and treasuries (except the Central Bank) within the jurisdiction should not only prepare monthly statements and loan target classification forms, but also follow the provisions of Item B of Article 2 of the Measures to Strengthen Financial Business Control. They must prepare a list of all loan and remittance amounts handled on that day, item by item, according to the place name, and submit it to the respective management bureaus for review.

### Wheat Purchase and Milling Contract

The Ministry of Food has commissioned five major flour mills in this city, namely Fuxin, Fufeng, Maoxin, Huafeng, and Yutong, to purchase wheat and mill it to supply food to various places. A total of 1.7 million dan of wheat has been received in the first phase, and 1.2 million dan has been milled so far, producing approximately 1.8 million bags of flour. It is learned that the Ministry of Food has recently renewed the second-phase wheat purchase and milling contract with major flour mills, planning to purchase 300,000 dan of wheat. The wheat payment will be made by the Agricultural Bank of China as it is received. According to the Joint Wheat Purchasing Office, the office has already purchased over 100,000 dan. However, due to current transportation difficulties and scarce sources, the wheat purchasing work is difficult to carry out quickly.

### Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association Resolves to Petition for Opening of Industrial Loans

Yesterday (the 18th), the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association of this city and six cities and counties, including Wujin, Wuxi, Wuxian, Changshu, Jiangyin, held the ninth representative conference at the Wenqi Dyeing and Weaving Vocational School in Minhang. More than eighty representatives attended, including Wang Hairun from Wuxi, Cha Binchu from Wujin, Ma Chunlin from Wuxian, Xu Zhibin from Changshu, Xu Shunnian from Jiangyin, and Pan Shihao, Que Pingzhi, and Wang Shaojun from Shanghai. After discussing the proposals, the following resolutions were made: 1. Petition the government to open year-end emergency industrial loans; 2. Petition the Flower Yarn and Cloth Management Committee to postpone the registration of replication industry manufacturers; 3. Reduce and exempt business tax for the dyeing and weaving industry; 4. Open up the re-export of South China cotton cloth; 5. Organize a joint research committee on yarn and cloth distribution; 6. Request the cotton yarn market in this city to issue entry and exit permits to outer counties, and other important matters. Afterwards, all the teachers and students of Wenqi Vocational School held a joint reception and took a group photo, which was very enthusiastic. In the evening, the Shanghai Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association held a banquet at the International Hotel, after which everyone dispersed.

### Rice Industry Authority States That Rice Prices Can Be Stable Long-Term

The five major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou are about to implement a full-scale rationing system for grain. The rice price surge of the past few days has leveled off, and people's minds are at ease. Rice prices in various places have fallen by more than 100,000 yuan compared to the morning peak. According to sources from the rice industry authority, rice prices are likely to fall sharply in the future, for the following reasons:

The current rice price has risen directly from over 600,000 yuan to 1.5 million yuan, a more violent increase than other commodities. Therefore, according to economic principles, the fall should also be very severe, possibly returning to within 1 million yuan.

The consumption of rice in Beijing and Shanghai accounts for the largest amount in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Now that huge amounts of foreign rice have arrived, rationing will begin in the two cities. The demand for rice in the rice-producing areas of Suxi Wujia will decrease, and prices are expected to continue to fall.

Over the past month, citizens have purchased and stored a lot of rice. Ordinary families have purchased and stored several months' worth of rice, so sales in rice shops have decreased sharply in recent days.

Continued tightening of credit, forcing hoarders to sell. Based on past experience, the rice market can be stable for a long period of time.

### Airplanes Prohibited From Transporting Cash; Ships and Trains Set Quotas

[United Credit Reporting Agency News] The Ministry of Finance has formulated measures to restrict the transportation of cash to Shanghai and stimulate prices, which will be announced and implemented soon. The content of this method is:

Airplanes are absolutely prohibited from carrying cash.

Ships and trains can carry a fixed amount of cash.

If the quota is exceeded, the legitimate use must be stated, and an application for a permit must be submitted to the local financial management bureau for approval.

If the quota is exceeded and not approved, the excess portion will be forcibly deposited for limited-term withdrawal if found. The Ministry of Finance is deliberating on setting this quota based on the situation.

### China Fisheries Company Formally Established Today

The China Fisheries Company of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, which has been in preparation for two years, will be formally established today. The government had previously decided to allow the public to invest half of the shares. Therefore, the new company decided to use all its existing assets as official shares and to attract commercial shares of equal value to the official shares to form a board of directors and supervisors. The share offering is in progress. As of September last year, the estimated value of all assets was 117.5 billion yuan, including Huasheng Steel Plant, Huali Shipyard, Cod Liver Oil Factory, Anchovy Factory, four cold storage and ice-making plants, and twelve new-style fishing vessels.

### Last Year's National Tung Oil Export: Totaled Approximately 73,000 Tons: Earned Approximately $30 Million in Foreign Exchange

According to accurate statistics from relevant sources, the total national tung oil export in 1947 was approximately 73,000 tons. Approximately 39,000 tons were shipped from Shanghai, accounting for 54% of the total. Approximately 33,600 tons were shipped from Hong Kong, accounting for 46% of the total. It is estimated that excluding over 10,000 tons smuggled through Hong Kong, the foreign exchange earned from tung oil exports last year was approximately $30 million. The China Vegetable Oil Factory accounted for the largest majority, followed by Yirui, Shenli, etc. The United States ranked first in terms of export countries, with approximately 48,000 tons, accounting for 66% of the total. The UK accounted for 7,800 tons, accounting for 11%. Continental European countries accounted for approximately 11,000 tons, accounting for 15%. India, Canada, South Africa, Japan, etc. accounted for approximately 2,500 tons, accounting for 3%. The China Trust Bureau's barter trade with the Soviet Union was 3,100 tons, accounting for 4%. Last year's tung oil export volume was not much different from before the war (the average annual export from 1935 to 1939 was 74,000 tons). Compared with the previous year's figures, it has increased by 84%. The reason for this is that the government has adopted various measures to promote exports and encourage foreign sales. Since the establishment of the Pingwei Fund Committee, foreign exchange has been adjusted at any time, and exporters have become more active. In addition, tung oil exporters and tung oil businesses in various places have supported the national policy and worked together. In addition, the CITIC Bureau was ordered to handle the purchase policy. Although its operating methods may not have fully conformed to the old habits of exporters at one time, and some believed it was competing with the people for profit, when my country's tung oil had no market abroad, the Bureau's purchase also provided considerable benefits to exporters. According to industry insiders' observations and evaluations of reports on crop production, this year's tung oil harvest is particularly good, and it is predicted that the total number of foreign sales in the future will not be reduced compared to last year. The only concern is that the production is slightly insufficient for supply. The reason is that after the implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong Cooperation, smuggling in South China has gradually decreased, and market prices can gradually stabilize. It is also estimated that the United States' monthly tung oil demand this year can increase to approximately 5,000 tons. Based on last year's total exports, it is only enough to supply the United States' needs. Including the UK's annual demand of 10,000 tons and other European countries, a situation of demand exceeding supply has formed. The increase in demand in the United States is mainly due to the steady supply of tung oil from my country after the war, gradually returning to the pre-war level, so it is no longer using substitutes. Regarding foreign market prices, the United States imported approximately 8,000 tons of tung oil from my country last month, coupled with the new oil being listed in that country, resulting in sluggish prices. The New York warehouse delivery price is 26 cents per pound. The UK is packaged in barrels, and each ton is 185 pounds. The domestic price in Shanghai is 3.2 million yuan per dan, and in Hankou it is 2.45 million yuan. (Unclear markings). It is also learned that the difficulty felt for the future of my country's tung oil is the transportation problem. In addition to delays during transportation, increased freight costs make it impossible to reduce costs. For example, the Yangtze River Shipping Industry Association originally stipulated that bulk tung oil freight be classified into the second category, but now it plans to be classified into the fourth category, which will increase the cost of tung oil exports.

### Winter Woolen Fabric Market Review: Costs Increase, Prices of Various Goods Repeatedly Set New Highs

This winter, woolen fabrics rose sharply in October. Because the cost has increased step by step, the increase has also been significant. The reasons for the rise were the surge in black market gold and cash, the stimulation of the issuance of large banknotes, the inability to set prices for imported goods, and the low production and high costs of domestically produced goods. At the same time, the actual sales of the local merchants were smooth, and the public's desire to exchange currency for goods was rekindled, holding the view that buying early is cheaper. As a result, various goods sold well and repeatedly set new high prices.

The lining and veil types of suits, which are subject to the sharp rise in silk yarn raw materials, rose even more rapidly, and the long-haired velvet also rose rapidly. The McOden business became more difficult, regretting that the increase was too fierce, and many had no desire to operate. The fine wool tweed, mostly based on the Zhanghua goods soaring one million yuan as the standard, McOden rose to 680,000 yuan, bringing it up a lot.

Riding breeches, tweed and women's fabrics also became very prosperous. From the 20th, the market suddenly turned sharply down. The average overall decline was more than 10% compared to the peak. It was not until the 27th that the decline stopped and returned to level, but looking back at the market for the first half of the month, it was still somewhat higher.

The reason why woolen fabrics were able to suddenly shrink was due to the economic police's strict crackdown on the black market and hoarders, and the city government's efforts to suppress prices and the central bank's tightening of credit all contributed to it.

In early November, woolen fabrics presented a stable and stable situation. In the middle of the month, most of the lower reaches showed shrinkage and fatigue, while the lower sentence was all increased. The market was full of news of profitable buying, especially for public and private enterprises. The manufacturers themselves hoarded existing goods and continued to increase prices, and the Sino Textile allocation price also did the same.

In the last month of winter, prices of goods rose sharply, and by the time large banknotes were issued, postal rates increased, the US exchange rate repeatedly rose, military tickets and other public utilities were readjusted, rice prices were high, and daily necessities rose, even though the Sino Textile Bureau allocated wool yarn and woolen fabrics, it was still useless. If credit is not tightened, its upward trend will be even greater.

The rise of McOden and Haibailong was the most unique. In terms of sales, due to the tightening of the head lining, Fanliding, which is produced by this factory, had a lot of orders, and with the pressure of high interest loans, after Christmas, the winter woolen fabrics were expected to be better, but they were not sure to be released. Ankai sales successively fell into order. The local merchants' sales continued to degenerate. The sales of the Ben Det foreign firm were exposed by economic police for doing black market deals, and the transactions were disordered. In terms of orders, after the city, most foreign firms were more cautious. Except for Hong Kong, which tried to ship, the rest were changed from US currency to national currency.

### On Transuranic Elements: Also Discussing the Problem of Chinese Names

â€” Bao Zhongqi

Since Mendeleev's periodic table, arranged by atomic weight order, was published in 1870, the chemical community has unanimously recognized it as a milestone in chemical progress. It has simplified countless complex and difficult-to-solve problems. Because Mendeleev's periodic table is based on the periodicity of the chemical properties of elements and their relationship with their atomic valence, the properties of various elements can be predicted and determined accordingly. The research on elements 43, 61, 85, and 87 was able to be perfected thanks to the assistance of the periodic table, and the accurate determination of atomic weights also relied on the periodic table for correction.

Of course, the periodic table is not without its shortcomings. For example, hydrogen does not have a proper place in the periodic table; rare earth elements cannot be sequentially listed in the table; isotopes cannot be clearly indicated in the table; and elements with different chemical properties are also in the same group. In addition, there are several places where the order of elements does not follow the increasing order of atomic weight.

However, no matter what, Mendeleev's periodic table is great. With his enlightenment, chemists have gradually studied and improved it, and we have obtained a fairly complete periodic table, that is, the periodic table arranged according to the International Atomic Weight Table published in 1940. From hydrogen with atomic number 1 to uranium with atomic number 92, there are a total of ninety-two elements.

Before 1940, scientists could only prove the existence of these ninety-two elements in nature. However, the periodic table clearly shows us that the elements in the seventh period all have radioactive properties. Elements like radium and uranium are not very stable themselves, so it is an incomplete period. It is possible that under our diligent research, there will be new discoveriesâ€”radioactive elements that have emitted helium nuclei (alpha particles) and turned into other elements must also be able to accept the impact of neutrons or other particles and turn into new elements.

This ideal, in the wartime scientific community, has achieved great success under the efforts for the urgent needs of the war: elements 93 Neptunium, 94 Plutonium, 95 Americium, 96 Curium, which were once thought to be no longer possible, have been discovered. These are the so-called transuranic elements, or post-uranium elements.

The discovery of transuranic elements is a major progress in the chemical community. It is an epoch-making contribution in the atomic age. At the same time, according to authoritative predictions in the scientific community, transuranic elements may be like rare earth metals, forming a series of more than a dozen elements with similar properties, expanding the periodic table to over one hundred positions. But these remain to be studied.

We have seen these elements countless times in newspapers and magazines, but the Chinese translations vary, which can easily cause misunderstandings for readers and is quite inconvenient. Therefore, we feel that it is necessary to unify and define the Chinese translations.

In fact, there are three traditional rules in the chemical community for naming a new element: The first person to confirm the existence of each element (or its isotope) has the right to name this new element, without having to be approved by academic institutions; the discovery of a new element, whether it is a natural discovery or a man-made isotope, should be recognized without discrimination; if the discovery of a new element is incorrect and is denied, then the right to name it should be given to the later official discoverer.

As for the Chinese translation of elements, this was originally the responsibility of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau, but before a formal decision is made, scholars and experts can propose translations for the convenience of application in literature, but they must still note the original name for reference. Therefore, there have been suggestions from various parties for the Chinese translations of new elements. For example, element 93, Neptunium, symbol Np, mass 239, has translations such as niobium, neptunium, and nickel; element 94, Plutonium, symbol Pu, mass also 239, has translations such as beryllium, etc. In fact, beryllium is in conflict with existing elements. Beryllium is the standard translation of BeryHium Be, is the standard translation of Praseodymium Pr in rare earth metals, which seems inappropriate. A more appropriate is , because the name Plutonium comes from Pluto, and translating the name as is more appropriate, however, the official translation still awaits confirmation by the National Compilation and Translation Bureau. As for other elements 95 Americium, elements 9698 Curium, due to the shorter time of discovery, there are no accurate reports on chemical properties, and there are no common translations.

In short, the translation requires accuracy and depends on the joint review of scientists, brainstorming, and will be helpful for future official approval.

This article is grateful to Dr. Tang Ningkang of Shanghai University for providing information. Thank you.

### Electronic Microscope

â€” Ming Yu

Human vision has become sharper recently due to a new type of ultramicroscope. The mysteries of "ultramicroscopic bodies" that this ultramicroscope can see are something scientists could not have dreamed of before. It uses electrons instead of ordinary light rays and magnetic fields instead of refracting glass, revealing a world that has never been seen before.

Present-day microscopes are generally divided into three types: the most common type uses ordinary light to observe, placing us in another world where objects can be magnified up to 2,000 times; another type, with which we are less familiar, uses ultraviolet rays, which are extremely short and invisible to the human eye, and can only work on dry plates. Images taken with this type of microscope can be magnified up to 5,000 times compared to the original object. As for the new electronic microscope, it uses even shorter rays and can magnify objects up to 10,000 to 30,000 times, and the image is clear.

Two large electrical companies, Siemens in Germany and RCA in the United States, have been or are engaged in the manufacture of this new machine.

The first microscope made was as large as a corner of a room, but the latest streamlined electronic microscope can be carried in and out of ordinary houses and is reasonably priced at only $9,500. Buyers are mostly medical, physics, or chemistry laboratories, as well as universities and industrial organizations. It only requires connection to ordinary household current for use.

Scientists are often reluctant to publicly announce new discoveries, but snippets of the phenomena they see in this new world are occasionally leaked from the laboratory. Some bacteria that we are already familiar with can now be photographed more accurately, and those that have never been captured on camera can also be photographed. It is said that typhoid bacteria have wavy flagella, but no one knows their function; yeast is covered with a continuous and firm outer membrane, forming a chain; the internal structure of whooping cough bacteria is extremely peculiar. However, these discoveries, due to limited knowledge, have not yet been practically useful. Similarly, the electronic microscope will certainly be of great hope for conquering diseases in the future.

The industrial world is also paying close attention to this new invention. Scientists in factories are rushing to RCA with the specimens they want to study, and they are very excited when they set off. They are all amazed by the structure and appearance of the specimens they see, such as synthetic textile fibers. It is said that before the war, German scientists believed that this new tool could be of great use, and they had already manufactured similar microscopes. The German method of cement manufacturing was improved by this. Later, they also engaged in the study of mineral dust, which is of great importance to the health of mine workers.

The electronic microscope has made great contributions to expanding human vision and peering into a point in the universe, but it does not have a stunning appearance, and is not as visually impressive as the 200-inch Palomar telescope. It is shaped like a cylinder, placed on a table, about six and a half feet high, with some knobs and dials on top. The external appearance is only like this. Inside, there is a filament as thin as a hair, installed at the top of the cylinder. When current passes through this filament, a stream of electrons is emitted. Directly below the filament, there is a potential difference to accelerate the downward trend of the electron stream. Further down is a magnetic field that bends the current and converges it into a focus. The inside of the cylinder must be free of air to allow the electrons to flow unobstructed, so it is necessary to design an airlock so that the specimen can be inserted without affecting its high vacuum, which is also a clever point in the manufacture of this microscope. (To be continued)

Scientific Discussion

### 1. My Views on the Sinicization of Digital Sectioning

â€” Jiang Tingji

Reading Mr. Zhou Shangmin's "Sinicization of Digital Sectioning" in the 21st issue of this publication made me feel both empathy and joy, as I implemented the four-digit sectioning method as early as last year. According to the standard amount line, I deeply feel that four-digit sectioning is suitable for Chinese habits. Its advantages are that the sectioning is disciplined, the numbers are clear, the calculation is convenient, and brainpower is saved. If we blindly follow the Western-style three-digit sectioning, it is like discarding chopsticks and spoons to use knives and forks, which is only making things difficult for ourselves.

In the past, the amount sectioning was mostly modeled on the Western style, and there were no clear regulations in our country. However, the current amount numbers are huge, and payments are mostly astronomical figures, so the sectioning lines have increased sharply. Moreover, "wan wan wei yi" (ten thousand ten thousands is a hundred million) and "wan yi wei zhao" (ten thousand hundred millions is a trillion) have been officially stipulated since 1944. If we still adopt the Western-style imitation, it is even more inappropriate.

For example, if you write a three-digit sectioned number, 4,528,629,300, I am afraid that seven or eight out of ten people will be unable to recognize the number at a glance. If you use four-digit sectioning and write it as 45e2862v9300, using "e" to represent "yi" (hundred million) and "v" to represent "wan" (ten thousand), taking its simple planning and similar sound, it is easy to remember. In this way, at a glance, you can recognize the number as four billion five hundred and twenty-eight million six hundred and twenty-nine thousand three hundred yuan. Whose convenience is obvious. Since the Western amount sectioning does not care about how we recognize it, why should the Chinese digital sectioning care about the Westerners. Moreover, Westerners do not have "wan" (ten thousand), they call ten thousand "ten thousand," and one hundred thousand "one hundred thousand," which is very inconvenient. The reading of Chinese and Western numbers is so different, how can we abandon ourselves to follow others blindly?

Moreover, in terms of transportation, driving to the left can also be changed to driving to the right. Then, in terms of accounting, can't we abolish the three-digit sectioning and use the four-digit sectioning instead? I hope that all sectors will gradually adopt the four-digit sectioning method, and even make it universally popular. Westerners can follow Western habits when interacting, but why shouldn't we use our own methods when counting ourselves, just like using both yin and yang layers at the same time. I hope that all the talented people and accounting experts in the country will participate in the discussion and give advice.

Deng Xinkang

After reading Mr. Zhou Shimin's "Sinicization of Digital Sectioning" in the 21st issue of this publication and Mr. Kong Fanqing's discussion on this issue in the 23rd issue, I would also like to express some opinions.

Nowadays, the numbers are huge and difficult to read, so it is necessary to clarify them for the sake of clarity. Everyone says that there is no "wan" (ten thousand) digit in the West. In fact, the word "wan" above the thousands in English is Myriad. For example, 12340000 in English can be read as one thousand two hundred and thirty-four Myriad. The ninth to twelfth digits are Million. 3000,0000,0000 in English can be read as three thousand Million. The thirteenth to sixteenth digits are Billion, the seventeenth to twentieth digits are Trillon, the twenty-first to twenty-fourth digits are Ouadrillion, and the twenty-fifth to twenty-eighth digits are Ouintillion. The reading method can be inferred. I have always advocated using the four-digit sectioning method and persuaded Westerners to adopt it, but looking at the advantages and disadvantages, there is no distinction between ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. This is just a question of convenience in the application of numbers, not a matter of international standardization, and there is no need to "panic"! In fact, there are some things that we don't need to follow foreigners.

### Wire Recorder

â€” Zhong Yong

Ordinary record players have to be interrupted after playing for a few minutes, even with automatic record changers. Moreover, wax records are fragile and bulky, so some people want to use another method to remedy these shortcomings.

As early as 1898, Danish scientist Paulsen pointed out the ideal of recording sound using "traces" made of magnetized metal; but he failed to overcome the difficulties he encountered and abandoned his experiment. It was not until 1942 that a 26-year-old American physicist, Camras, succeeded in his experiment based on the inspiration of his predecessor.

Camras's research was prompted by his cousin, because Camras's cousin was a singer who wanted to record his own voice for research. The progress of magnetism and electricity has been considerable in the past 50 years, and Camras has completed the work that his predecessors had not completed by relying on his knowledge in this field.

Camras passed a steel wire at a constant speed between the two poles adjacent to the electromagnet, and at the same time converted the sound waves into electrical impulses and passed them into the coil of the electromagnet. As a result, the electromagnet emits more or less magnetic force lines, and the steel wire also immediately feels continuous but changing magnetic properties, becoming many tiny permanent magnets, whose polar strengths vary but correspond to the original sound wave. If you want to reproduce the sound, first put the steel wire with the "traces" between the magnetic poles of the electromagnet and pass it through at the same speed as when recording. A pulsating current will occur in the coil. After amplification, connect it to a loudspeaker, and you can hear the same sound as at the beginning.

In the first few experiments, Camras found that when the steel wire passed through, if it twisted itself or turned an angle with the position during recording, the sound emitted would also become distorted and harsh instead of the original sound. Later, he moved the two magnetic poles very close, and also drew a small groove on the top to let the steel wire pass through and then move, and the defect of the sound being distorted was corrected. This improvement created a new type of recorder that can be used continuously for eight hours. It is only a roll of thin steel wire five inches in diameter and ten inches thick. Do you think old-fashioned record players and records can not be eliminated and become antiques?

Steel wire recorders are widely used in the military. For example, wireless radio outposts can use it to record tens of thousands of foreign broadcasts, and troops going to the front line can take it with them to record the sounds of the entire war. Civil aviation aircraft can use it as a flight log. If it is arranged with asbestos, it can also provide the best data for studying the cause of the accident in the event of an accident. Currently, GE and many manufacturers are manufacturing this type of recorder. Camras is also working with other scientists to promote its use.

The peacetime use of steel wire recorders is no less than that of portable wireless radios. It can record any sound, from a brilliant jazz music to a complete symphony or opera. Whether it is next to the radio, in the theater, in the nightclub, or in the concert hall, you can record speeches, meetings, trials, and even the entire agenda of the parliament on this slender steel wire.

### Wood Bleaching Method

â€” Liu Suisheng

Bleaching agents such as bleaching powder are widely used for bleaching cloth and paper, which are well known; but they are not suitable for bleaching wood. Household woodenware and wood used for decorations are mostly not pure white, so the wood bleaching method is needed.

The formula for the chemicals used for bleaching wood is as follows:

Sodium silicate (commonly known as water glass) 16 parts

Sodium perborate 1.5 parts

Mix the above two chemicals and dissolve them in boiling water for use. When bleaching wood, simply dip a brush in this bleaching solution, apply it to the surface of the wood to be bleached, let it stand for half an hour, wipe off the solution, and wash it with water. After it dries naturally, polish it.

Note that this solution has a very strong bleaching power. If applied twice, the wood can be transformed from the color of bones to ivory white; even gray-black wood such as walnut wood can be effectively bleached with this solution.

Note: Water glass is a gray-white block or powder that can be dissolved in water. The molecular formula is Na2SiO3, which is made by dissolving sand (silicon dioxide) in a caustic soda solution.

Sodium perborate is a white crystalline substance with a salty taste that can be dissolved in water. The molecular formula is NaBO3.H2O or NaBO3.4H2O. The preparation method is to mix borax, sodium peroxide, and hydrogen peroxide solution and heat it to make it crystallize, or to pour boric acid and sodium peroxide into cold acidic water.

### Dreams

â€” Huang Baorui

We all know that dreams are a very ordinary thing. Although a person does not dream every night, everyone should have had the experience of dreaming. At the same time, because dreams are ever-changing, there is always a mysterious feeling floating in people's minds about dreams, which also gives people a wrong idea.

Some people must ask, why do we dream?

To solve this problem, we must first understand that dreams are closely related to our wishes and experiences; because people's wishes are endless, and these wishes remain in different stages of individual development. Some of them can be satisfied in the entire individual development, and some cannot be satisfied. As for those wishes that cannot be satisfied, they are all suppressed in the subconscious. However, these suppressed wishes are not easily reduced and continue to be active in the subconscious. They often conflict with consciousness. If the power of the former exceeds the latter, not only will mistakes, jokes, illusions, and dreams occur, but sometimes the personality will tend to go bankrupt. When sleeping, the resistance of this conscious suppression is reduced, so the power of wishes in the subconscious increases and begins to be active. Therefore, those hidden experiences and wishes flow into the conscious world, and thus dreams are produced.

Some people ask me: "Why do we have nightmares when we hold our hands against our chests? Why do we dream of eating when we are hungry?" Although this question has research value, it gives people a wrong idea, because everyone actually thinks that this kind of stimulation is the origin of dreams. In fact, it is not. Chest pressure and hunger are just supplements to the number of dreams. Psychologists divide this kind of stimulation into two categories: external stimulation and internal stimulation.

External Stimulation

Tactile sensationâ€”Dreams and the stimulation of tactile sensation are different; for example, dreaming that someone is pressing on the chest is due to one's own hand pressing down on the chest or a large amount of cotton quilt. This has been proved in Freud's interpretation of dreams. Someone dreamed of being sentenced to death by a judge at night, which was because his collar was too tight. Someone dreamed of sleeping with a girl at night, which was because his legs were holding his own hands...

Visionâ€”If there is light stimulating the eyelids during sleep, it will also change the dream. I have a friend who dreamed at night that his new house was on fire and he couldn't put it out in time. The flames soared into the sky. When he woke up, he saw his old mother lighting a candle to find something; I once dreamed that my plane crashed on an iceberg. When I woke up, I found that the sunlight was shining on my face.

Hearingâ€”If there is external sound stimulating hearing, it will also transfer the dream. For example, Gujin Tushu JichengÂ·Dream Department says that if there is nothing, then you will dream of watching the drum beating. When you wake up, you only see your younger brother knocking on the door as the sound of the drum. Someone dreamed at night that a company was stolen, and alarm bells rang loudly, which was disturbed and frightened. It turned out to be the sound of the church bells.

Internal Stimulation

This situation is recorded in many ancient Chinese books. For example, Su WenÂ·Fu Yao Jingwei Pian says: "If Yin is abundant, you will dream of wading through a large body of water and be frightened. If Yang is abundant, you will dream of a big fire burning. If Yin and Yang are both abundant, you will dream of killing and injuring each other..." Another example is "If you are too full, you will give; if you are too hungry, you will take," etc., which everyone can understand. For example, people who are about to suffer from a fever will dream of monsters attacking; people who are about to suffer from hemiplegia will dream of being split in half, etc. These are all caused by internal stimulation, but remember, these are not the origin of dreams.

Secondly, we often see many people who worry about dreaming every night. They seek advice and fortune-telling everywhere, thinking that this is a symbol of poor health or neurasthenia. This concept is wrong. We must know that dreaming is not a physical phenomenon, but a psychological phenomenon, that is, dreams are the interpretation of personal past experience stimuli and the response to stimuli. Therefore, both fat and thin people, healthy and morbid people, will inevitably dream.

Finally, what I want to say is that dreams have great contributions and benefits to us.

As mentioned earlier, people's wishes cannot be satisfied, and those wishes that cannot be satisfied are suppressed in the subconscious. Freud calls this consciousness that controls wishes the "self-heart supervision" (Endopsychicor). During the day, this resistance can mostly suppress subconscious wishes. When you fall asleep, this resistance is reduced, and the power of subconscious wishes increases, and they begin to be active in the conscious world. At this time, the sleeper has the wish to sleep, so these two wishes conflict with each other. At this time, if there is no dream phenomenon, a person's sleep will be affected, and the body and mind will be threatened (insomnia can be used as a reference). Therefore, dreams are produced to avoid these two conflicts. Dreams not only protect your sleep, but also indirectly satisfy our wishes. Now we should know what dreams are all about. Speaking of which, we should be able to correct people's view of the premonitions of dreams.

In order to give the reader a concept of dreams, the main points of the above-mentioned dreams are listed in a simple table as follows:

Originâ€”For the desire of wish,

Contentâ€”For the satisfaction of wish.

Formâ€”For the experience of illusion,

Functionâ€”For the security of sleep.

### On Foresight

â€” He Ku

A few days ago, the Siberian cold wave fiercely attacked Shanghai. The north wind blew particularly hard, making the zinc sheets on the roof of my humble house rattle. My servant Chongjing said to me, fortunately it didn't rain, otherwise my house would leak again. Speaking of roof leaks, it is a heartbreaking thing. Although this house is repaired every year, in addition to having a psychological guarantee, it is like no repairs at all. Every year during the rainy season, there is a big leak. Of course, "a broken house suffers from continuous rain" is common sense, so being sleepless all night is a common suffering. In resentment, after the weather clears, I immediately call a zinc sheet worker to repair it. It is strange to say that after the repair, the rainy season has passed, and the weather has been sunny for a long time. Since no rainwater falls from above, it is impossible to know whether the leak has been repaired or not. After half a year of wind and sun, the zinc sheet is no longer bound by the zinc nails and "rises up in time." As a result, in the next mildew season, isn't there still a big leak?

Therefore, after the north wind blew wildly this year, and the zinc sheet predicted a leak, I thought I had to follow the words of Zhu Zi's family motto, "It is appropriate to plan ahead before it rains," and ask a zinc sheet worker to repair and check it in advance. Scarlett, the heroine of Gone with the Wind, woke up in the vicissitudes of life, frequently encountering changes in the world, and returned to her quiet pastoral life in her hometown. Her only wish was to have a house that did not leak. A house that does not leak has become one of the wishes of life, which also shows how many leaky houses there are in the world.

In fact, a leaky house is a small matter. What is "affected" is only one room. If the Yellow River floods, it would be unimaginable. Homes are destroyed, residents drift, and what follows are famine, disease, cold, and even death. Therefore, the theories of those who have governed the Yellow River throughout history do not go beyond two ways: the best policy is to treat the root cause, focusing on dredging; the second best policy is to treat the symptoms, focusing on strengthening the dikes. Of course, dredging is better than strengthening the dikes, which is an active measure of foresight. As for strengthening the dikes, the flood always breaks the defense line, rushing in. In the years of Yellow River disaster, dikes must be repaired, which is the same as repairing the zinc sheets in my humble house every year.

Therefore, I advocate preventing problems before they occur, and we must use the method of dredging. Remove pollution and congestion, buffer the rapids, channel the streams, and bring them into the sea. This is the best method in the "On Foresight". All man-made disputes should be dredged in advance, so that the dikes will be strong on their own, and many shocking and unfortunate events in newspapers can be reduced invisibly.

### Nameless Heroes

â€” Hilly

During the occupation of France, besides a few well-known resistance heroes, there were also many nameless heroesâ€”men, women, and even children, all of whom willingly suffered or risked their lives to help their Allied forces. The following story fully demonstrates their courage and spirit.

One morning in 1944, a British fighter plane was unfortunately shot down over Normandy. The pilot safely descended to the ground by parachute. He threw away the helmet he was wearing, put on a raincoat to completely cover his inner military uniform, and began speaking French to people. This simple disguise allowed him to impersonate a local resident. Suddenly, he remembered a place where he could temporarily hide in case of misfortune. So, he entered a town and boarded a train. The carriage was already full of French people, and he sat down among them. After the ticket inspector checked his ticket, he thought he was out of danger. However, before long, a policeman entered to check the identity cards of each passenger. The only document the pilot had could only prove that he was a member of the Royal Air Force.

The policeman looked at the unusual document again and again. After a long while, he finally asked, "What is this?"

"My identity card."

"Are you a pilot?"

"Yes."

"Are you serving in the Royal Air Force?"

"Yes."

"What are you doing here?"

"I was shot down here... I want to escape."

The surprised policeman exclaimed, "But, sir, you must know that such a document is not valid! You will be in trouble."

The pilot shrugged helplessly. The passengers in the carriage had just buried my deceased brother-in-law. His build is similar to yours. I will give you the clothes he left behind, which will give you much convenience."

Another old man with a white beard said, "You are an officer, and I am a retired officer. Of course, I will protect you. You should come to my house."

The carriage was filled with noise, with everyone vying to say, "I will help you do this. I will do that for you..." In short, everyone wanted to drown out the voices of others and offer their own advice to help the pilot. Even the policeman did not want to be left behind and offered his advice.

Although there might have been one or two German informants or spies in the carriage, who could have been executed for aiding the enemy, none of them were willing.

When the train arrived at its destination, the passengers crowded around the pilot and got out of the carriage. The policeman went down first and said to a French military policeman who was checking passengers at the station, "That man without a hat is my friend. Please let him pass." The pilot was escorted by the other passengers and safely left the train station.

Two weeks later, he had safely returned to London.

Mao Yi, British Broadcaster. The "Daily Express" (Daily Express), run by British newspaper magnate Lord Beaverbrook, has a daily circulation of nearly four million copies, making it one of Britain's leading newspapers. The "Daily Express" is located on Fleet Street in London, where it is busy day and night. One floor is the printing room, where the noise of the machines is incessant all night. Before the war, the newspaper published twenty-four pages a day, and four hundred tons of white paper were printed with black text every night. During and after the war, due to paper conservation, the number of pages has been reduced to six. However, due to increased circulation, the "Daily Express" still needs 130 tons of paper every day.

The second floor is the editorial department, which has twelve telegraph receivers that are constantly ticking all day long. From 8:30 in the morning, clerks come to transcribe the telegrams. They divide the telegrams into three categories: international news, domestic news, and sports news, and then hand them over to the respective managing editors. The editorial offices of each department are also not small. The international news editorial office alone has ten desks, and one person is specially responsible for classifying telegrams according to country.

The editorial department holds two meetings a day, chaired by the editor-in-chief. The first meeting is held at noon, and the second is held at 5:30 in the afternoon. The discussions mainly involve reviewing the past and handling the allocation and attitude of news work.

After the second meeting is over, the assistant editors begin to work. They work a full eight hours a dayâ€”from 6:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. the next morning. However, unlike our country's editors who work seven days a week, they have two days off each week on a rotating basis.

The "Daily Express" has branches in the two major cities of Manchester and Glasgow. There are dedicated telegraph lines between the two branches and the main office, and telegrams are exchanged without delay, with daily transmissions and receipts reaching 30,000 to 40,000 words.

The "Daily Express" also has a very busy telephone service. Seventeen operators start working at 5:00 in the morning. There are about 3,000 incoming and outgoing calls on weekdays, and even on holidays there are 1,000 incoming and outgoing calls.

There are three tea supply points in the London headquarters, which are open all day in shifts to provide tea for the more than 3,200 employees in the building. The daily consumption of tea reaches 19 and a half pounds.

### Naive Arguments

â€” Wu Yong

Today, grand pronouncements and high-sounding arguments are abundant, but they are mostly self-serving or outdated clichÃ©s, and extremely unreasonable. I think that children's words are sometimes quite delightful. This is especially true for parents. Walter Winchell once said, "In your mother's eyes, you can do no wrong, because she is always observing you with her heart." I hereby record a few interesting sayings belowâ€”

A three-year-old girl saw wrinkles on her palms while taking a bath. She said, "Mommy, look how sad my hands are!"

When a teacher was observing his young students, he discovered that a student named Xier had the dirtiest hands. He said to the students, "If you can point out another hand that is dirtier than Xier's, I will not punish him."

No one in the classroom made a sound. Finally, Xier himself said softly, "Teacher, please look at my other hand."

My four-year-old niece was originally playing in the snow with two friends, but suddenly left them and ran towards me, looking like she was about to cry.

I asked her, "Binbin, what's wrong?"

She sobbed and said, "My boyfriend, Tang Ge, doesn't like me anymore."

I comforted her, "Why do you say that? Tang Ge certainly likes you. I was watching you when you were playing, and you seemed to be having a lot of fun."

"No, I can see it! He throws snow at the new girl more than he throws it at me!"

A boy had just learned some astronomical knowledge and wanted to impart his astronomy to his younger sister in the evening.

He solemnly asked his younger sister, "Do you see that little speck of a star in the sky? That little star is much bigger than the Earth."

His younger sister did not believe him and retorted, "Then why can't it block the rain?"

A child drew a horse for his mother to see. The mother said, "But why does this horse have five legs?"

The child explained, "I gave it five legs in case one of them breaks."

### God and Calluses

â€” Tong

A sixteen-year-old girl was lying down, about to die. She was the eldest sister in a large, impoverished family without a mother. She had borne the burden of the family throughout her childhood. Due to overwork, she contracted tuberculosis and was about to die. A visitor asked her if she had been baptized or attended church. She replied, "No."

The visitor said, "Then what will you tell God when your soul goes to heaven?"

The child stretched out a pair of thin and almost transparent hands, covered in calluses from constant work, and said, "I will give a pair of hands to God to see!"

### Dentist Bird

â€” Tuo

If African crocodiles develop dental problems, it is very convenient to find a dentist. In fact, all they have to do is open their mouths. A dentist bird that lives on the banks of the Nile River will immediately fly over to treat them when it sees this "pain signal." The bird, which is about the size of a sparrow, sees the crocodile's mouth permanently open as if yawning, and then dives into the crocodile's mouth full of cavities to work. The dentist bird's medical work includes pecking away leeches and other parasites that adhere to the crevices of the teeth, under the tongue, and in the recesses of the oral cavity.

Is there a medical fee? No matter how savage crocodiles are, they have a gentleman's agreement that they cannot swallow the little bird in one gulp during the treatment process.

### Carefree Flower

â€” Chen Shengyan

Chapter Eight: Effort Failed (46)

After Zhu Qi and Yun Qing finished lunch, they went to the bank together. Yun Qing went straight to Feng Sheng's house and saw her wearing a cotton robe, covered in grease, with a white cloth apron around her waist. She had just come out of the kitchen and said with a smile, "Sister-in-law, you are so busy!" Feng Sheng said, "What can I do? Zhu Qi can't eat the dishes cooked by the old woman. If I don't do it, he won't eat a meal all day." Upon hearing this, Yun Qing felt a pang of guilt in her heart. She knew how loyal Feng Sheng was to Zhu Qi. I came here to stir up trouble and ruin her good marriage. I feel ashamed! Feng Sheng invited Yun Qing into the house, poured tea, and offered her a seat, chattering about household expenses, how much rice cost, how much coal cost, and so on. Yun Qing was in no mood to listen to her. She secretly pondered whether to say what she had planned to say. It would hurt her heart if she did, but she would miss the opportunity if she didn't. She was usually very confident, but today she felt confused. Feng Sheng said many things, but Yun Qing didn't hear a word of it. Later, Feng Sheng asked her how much it would cost to make a gold pin. Yun Qing vaguely didn't know what she was asking and just nodded and said, "Yes, yes." Feng Sheng saw that Yun Qing was absent-minded, just staring blankly at her, and didn't seem to be as lively and talkative as usual. She asked, "Elder sister, what's wrong with you today? Are you sick?" Yun Qing was startled by her question. She frowned, wanting to speak but hesitating. Feng Sheng said, "You are a very loyal person, but men are very fickle. Don't be angry at what I'm about to say." Feng Sheng said, "Elder sister, you must have heard Zhu Qi saying something about me outside. Please tell me. I won't be angry." Yun Qing thought to herself, if I slowly tell her, her mind is not clear, she will not be able to understand the situation, it is better to tell her directly and happily that Zhu Qi wants to divorce her, and see how she reacts. Having made up her mind, she frowned and said, "I shouldn't tell you this, but I am so angry that I have to tell you. Zhu Qi has decided to divorce you!" Feng Sheng heard these words as if she had been struck by lightning. Her two big eyes widened, and she was stunned, unable to say a word. After a long while, she wailed and burst into tears on the table. Yun Qing felt sorry and repeatedly persuaded her, telling her not to cry. Feng Sheng cried and shouted, "What should I do! What should I do! He doesn't want me anymore. I knew there would be such a day! I'm finished, I'm finished!" Yun Qing said, "Don't cry. Things are not that simple. I came here today to stand up for you and discuss this matter with you. I sympathize with you. Even if Zhu Qi doesn't want you, you can't just agree to him casually."

### The Reason Why Muslims Don't Eat Pork

â€” Wu Tegong

Islam was introduced to China during the Tang Dynasty, more than 1,300 years ago. The reason why Muslims do not eat pork is just a small part of Islamic customs and is not very mysterious, yet it has received much attention from non-Muslims. For example, Cantonese people consider snake and cat to be delicious "Dragon Tiger Soup," and also like to eat mice. People from other provinces do not consider it strange that people from other provinces do not eat these three things, and they do not make any wild guesses.

However, many people often consider it a strange thing that Muslims do not eat pork and make all kinds of unpleasant remarks. In fact, the reason why Muslims absolutely adhere to this prohibition is simply because they devoutly follow the admonitions in the ancient Islamic scripture, the Quran. The following is a translation of the text in the Quran regarding the dietary prohibitions for Muslims to clarify the matter.

The Quran says, "Say to the believers: Eat of the good things We have provided you and be thankful to Allah (the Arabic name for the Lord), if it is Him you worship. He has only forbidden you dead animals (Note: fish is not included), blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah. But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring [it] nor transgressing [its limit], there is no sin upon him. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful." (Chapter 2, verses 172 and 173)

Before the revelation of the above two verses, Allah had revealed to Muhammad a similar admonition: "Say, 'I do not find within that which was revealed to me [anything] forbidden to one who would eat it unless it be a dead animal or blood spilled out or the flesh of swine - for indeed, it is impure - or a sinful [offering] dedicated to other than Allah...'" (Chapter 6, verse 146)

Allah finally revealed: "Forbidden to you are dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah, and [animals] strangled or beaten to death or killed by a fall or gored to death or killed by a wild animal - except what you [are able to] slaughter [before its death] - and what is sacrificed on stone altars, and [prohibited is] that you seek decision through divining arrows. That is grave disobedience." (Chapter 5, verse 3)

The Quran's dietary prohibitions for Muslims are exhausted in the above text. From this, it can be seen that Muslims not only do not eat pork, but also do not eat cattle and sheep that have not been slaughtered in the name of Allah, animals that have died naturally or have been injured and not formally slaughtered, or morally corrupt meat. As for the reason why they do not eat pork, the scripture specifically indicates that this substance is impure and is listed below dead animals and blood, indicating that it is similar to these two substances. Therefore, Muslims not eating meat is just a small part of Islamic customs. Apart from following scripture and paying attention to hygiene, there is no other reason. They can even eat a little when they are starving. As for why they never taste it on a normal day, it is true. Not eating pork is not a unique prohibition of Islam. According to ancient history, the priests and nobles of Egypt did not eat this substance long ago, also because it was impure. Judaism also does not eat pork. Deuteronomy 14:8 says, "And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase." Leviticus 11:7-8 also has the same text. The texts in the four Gospels of the New Testament that mention animals also prove that Jesus considered pigs to be unclean animals. Although non-Muslims in China like to eat pork, the various medical opinions recorded in the Materia Medica under the category of pigs all recognize that pork is harmful. (The article is too long to quote). Modern science has discovered that pork contains more than a dozen different types of putrefactive bacteria, the most harmful of which is the trichinella worm, which is as thin as a hair and can cause several types of diseases. Therefore, the fact that Muslims absolutely do not eat pork is a true indication that they absolutely pay attention to hygiene and there is nothing mysterious about it.

The author has been involved in the press for a long time and is also a Muslim, so I uphold justice and write this humble article to contribute to the public. At this time of great turmoil, non-Muslims and Muslims should especially help each other in the same boat and care for each other. Therefore, not only should we abandon all false statements about Muslims not eating pork, but also about Islam, such as "holding the scriptures in the left hand and holding the sword in the right hand." This is the author's sincere wish.

### On Scholarships

â€” Zhong Ming

The Municipal Scholarship Unification Committee has decided to increase the total amount of scholarships for the next semester to 15 billion yuan. Scholarships for students at public universities will be 1.5 million to 3 million yuan, and scholarships for students at private universities will be 3 million to 4.5 million yuan. In today's high-inflation environment, although this amount is not very large, it still has an exciting effect on ordinary poor students. At the same time, in terms of the significance of social figures giving encouragement to poor students, it has infinite value.

Since scholarships give hope to poor students and have social significance, the school authorities and the Unification Committee should conduct accurate reviews and careful assessments when reviewing the quota and amount of the scholarship. The specific review standards and methods have already been stipulated by various schools and the Unification Committee, but whether the distribution of funds is rationalized may not be entirely as ideal as we would like.

For example, in the past, various schools used grades as the review standard. It is said that only those with grades above 75 points could receive a small scholarship, and only those with grades above 80 points could receive a larger scholarship. In this way, poor students are at a relatively disadvantageous position. Because poor students often earn money in various ways, such as submitting articles or working part-time, to pay for their meals, they have to transfer some precious time away from their studies. In this case, their grades are slightly worse than those of students who are well-fed and have no worries. This is a very forgivable fact. When reviewing scholarships, if a truly poor student does not receive a scholarship or only receives a small scholarship for just one or two points difference, while many students who can be well-fed or even quite wealthy receive the benefits, how unfair and unreasonable is this phenomenon?

If the establishment of scholarships is only for scholarship's sake, then it is perfectly acceptable to use grades as the review standard. However, if, in addition to scholarships, it also has the meaning of cultivating poor students not to drop out of school due to economic difficulties, then students with the same grades but vastly different economic situations cannot be treated the same. When reviewing scholarships, various schools should reasonably coordinate the "degree" of poverty of each applicant in addition to grades as a matter of course. Rather than subsidizing well-fed students with valuable scholarships for new clothes or entertainment, it would be better to help students who are just a few points behind and are frowning and worrying about not being able to pay for their meals. Only in this way can scholarships maintain their original meaning.

### Chengyi High School Students Enthusiastically Help Refugees - Rice Coupon Books Sent to Winter Relief Association for Distribution

Rice coupons were transferred to the Winter Relief Association for distribution. The Student Union of Shanghai Private Chengyi High School recently sent a letter to this newspaper stating: "In response to the winter clothing donation campaign, this association launched a winter clothing donation campaign among students at all levels at the end of December last year, raising more than 700 pieces of winter clothing of various sizes, worth more than 9 million yuan. In addition to winter clothing, after investigation, and in conjunction with the Advanced Mechanical Vocational School and the Huisheng Midwifery School, refugees were distributed in the Nanshi Ninghe Road and Sanpailou areas. The remaining winter clothing funds have been negotiated with Tianyi Rice Store on Xingguo Road (at the intersection of Tai'an Road) in this city to release Xian rice on a selected date. We have long admired your organization's outstanding achievements in serving the community, and we especially request your assistance in distributing rice coupons to jointly promote justice. Enclosed are 308 rice coupons, please check and handle," etc. In addition to having agreed with the association to send the rice coupons to the Shanghai Winter Relief Committee for redistribution to refugees to show prudence and avoid disputes, we also express our sincere gratitude to Chengyi High School, Advanced Mechanical Vocational School, Zhuan Sheng Student Association School students at all levels, and people from all walks of life who have generously donated on behalf of the beneficiary refugees.
