### Fruitful Results in Eastern Hebei剿匪 Campaigns: Capture of the Bandit Army's Political Center, Santunying; Nationalist Troops in Southern Tianjin Recapture Shengfang Town

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 7th] Military News: A certain unit of the Nationalist army in Eastern Hebei has crossed Xingcheng Town (southeast of Zunhua) and continued its northward advance. After eliminating the resistance of 2,000 Communist bandits, it captured Santunying, the political center of the bandit army in Eastern Hebei, on the morning of the 8th.

The Ping-Bao Highway has not yet been restored, shipping is also not smooth, prices are soaring, and the city's order is in a semi-wartime state. The joint universities here urgently sent a telegram on the 8th to Hebei Chairman Chu Xichun, requesting him to fly to Baoding quickly after Commander-in-Chief Ji, to resolve general administration, and to send senior officials to be stationed permanently in Baoding, to preside over major plans, and to move the provincial administrative center back to Baoding as soon as possible, in order to reassure the people.

### The Situation in Taiyuan is Increasingly Stable: Nationalist Troops on the West Bank of the Fen River Advance Southward Step by Step

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 8th] The situation in Taiyuan is becoming increasingly stable. The Nationalist army on the periphery has been pursuing and suppressing the remnants of the bandits for days, with great gains. The bandit army, suffering heavy casualties, has changed its tactics, avoiding direct combat with the Nationalist army during the day, and engaging in sporadic harassment at night. At 2 PM on the 7th, a certain unit of the Nationalist army swept through the area north of Huangzhai in the north of the city, encountering over 200 bandits in the mountains south of Mapotou. After several hours of intense fighting, the bandits were unable to withstand the attack and fled north. At 11 PM, bandit gangs harassed villages such as Dayuezhuang and Daxiaohan east of Huangzhai. After being fiercely attacked by the defending troops, they scattered and fled. The Nationalist army on the west bank of the Fen River is still advancing southward step by step. The bandits entrenched in Jinyuan are under strong pressure from the Nationalist army and are forcibly conscripting laborers to demolish the city walls and destroy fortifications, attempting to abandon the city and flee south.

### Bandit Army's Probing Offensive on the Outskirts of Jinan Fails

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 8th] Over 4,000 bandits who fled from Tusikou and Wenzu Town and invaded Guodian and Dalongzao south of it were severely attacked by a powerful unit of the Nationalist army on the evening of the 5th. By noon on the 6th, the bandits were unable to withstand the attack and retreated near Wenzu Town. In addition, the reconnaissance battalion of the bandit's 9th Column, which had fled to Dongwu, more than ten kilometers southeast of Jinan City, in early July, was completely driven out by the Nationalist army after a sweep on the afternoon of August 4th, with many bandits killed, including a bandit reconnaissance team leader.

According to a spokesman for the agency, the postponement has no special significance and is only because Steelman has decided that he needs more time to complete discussions.

[United Press, Washington, 8th] Senior officials of the Economic Cooperation Administration said on the 8th that the $245 million aid to China plan can indirectly help trade in the Far East (including Japan), in addition to direct aid to China. They denied that Japan would be built into an industrial giant and emphasized that China's reconstruction could utilize Japan's industry, which would be beneficial and harmless.

### Future Work of the Economic Cooperation Administration: Assisting Constructive Work

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 8th] Mr. O'Vay, Director of the Tianjin Office of the China Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, attended the Tianjin Municipal Government's monthly meeting and spoke about the various activities and significance of the Economic Cooperation Administration in China. He said that the U.S. government had long believed that China would need various kinds of assistance after the end of the war, and the China Relief Mission, which ended its operations on June 30th, first launched food distribution in five major cities, hoping to solve the problem of people's food in people's livelihood. He emphasized that distribution is not relief, so the Cooperation Administration believes that the distribution price should be the same as the market price, because distribution does not distinguish between rich and poor, and allowing the rich to buy expensive grain at a low price would be unbalanced and would require government subsidies. Recently, it has been proposed to adopt high prices and encourage local food production to increase supply for distribution, so as to reduce government consumption. He also said that the Food Department has decided that the food ration from August to November will all be produced locally, and the Cooperation Administration will ship after November. The future work of the Cooperation Administration will focus on assisting constructive work such as industry, commerce, and agriculture.

### Huainan Railway to be Repaired in Sections

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Ministry of Transportation News: The Huainan Railway, from Tianjiadian to Yuxikou, is 208 kilometers long. It was ordered to be destroyed in October of the 26th year. After the entire stack fell in June of the 27th year, the enemy restored the mine road in order to seize the coal mines in the Datong area of Huainan. Since water transport on the Yangtze River was inconvenient in the 33rd year, a section of the track from Shuijiahu to Yuxikou, about 18 kilometers long, was dismantled and moved to repair the Shuijiahu-Bengbu branch line, about 61 kilometers long, to connect with the Jinpu Railway. After the victory, the bandits greatly destroyed this branch line again. It was not until June 1st of the 35th year that it was repaired and opened to traffic. The track materials required for the section of the road from Shuijiahu to Yuxikou were ordered from abroad by the Huainan Railway Company in sections. A part of them has already been transported to the site. The laying of rails on the section from Shuijiahu to Hefei began on July 7th. The section from Hefei to Yuxikou in the south will be repaired after the completion of the other sections.

### Jiangsu Province Formulates Implementation Measures to Relieve Refugees in Seven Districts; First Batch of Funds of 100 Billion Allocated

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Jiangsu Province's use of international relief funds to carry out relief work is in accordance with the Ministry of Social Affairs' "Refugee Relief Plan for Important Areas." The Jiangsu Provincial Relief and Welfare Enterprise Review Committee was first established to formulate the province's implementation measures for refugee relief and submitted them to the Ministry of Social Affairs to forward to the Executive Yuan to handle the allocation of funds from the U.S. Relief Materials Committee. The measures divide the province into seven districts, including Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, Zhai County, Putong, Huaiyin, Xuzhou, and Donghai. Each district establishes a district review committee to promote relief matters, targeting refugees who cannot survive without relief. In addition to providing food to the elderly, weak, and disabled, those who have the ability to work are encouraged to participate in labor relief and the evacuation of refugees to return to their hometowns to resume their businesses. The Ministry of Social Affairs has now allocated 100.0157 billion yuan to the province for the first time from the U.S. Relief Materials Committee, which was remitted to the province's review committee for inspection on July 14. The committee reported that it has allocated 13,320,181,000 yuan to the Zhenjiang district, planning to relieve 7,000 people; 9,514,915,000 yuan to the Jiangdu district, planning to relieve 5,000 people; 5,708,949,000 yuan to the Nantong district, planning to relieve 3,000 people; 9,514,915,000 yuan to the Huaiyin district, planning to relieve 5,000 people; 28,544,745,000 yuan to the Xuzhou district, planning to relieve 15,000 people; 19,029,830,000 yuan to the Donghai district, planning to relieve 10,000 people; and 9,514,915,000 yuan to the Taixian district, planning to relieve 3,000 people. The remaining 5,007,850,000 yuan is for transportation and usage fees. The committee has also sent personnel to various districts to supervise and guide the active promotion of relief work.

### New Economic Plan Formulated; Song Ziwen and Yu Hongjun Fly to Shanghai This Morning; Zhang Qun Plans to Meet MacArthur in Japan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Since Mr. Song Ziwen arrived in Nanjing, people from all walks of life have been visiting him very frequently. On the morning of the 8th, Mr. Song went to the Christ Victory Song Church to attend the worship service. At noon, he attended a banquet hosted by the President, and many senior officials were invited to participate. At 5 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, President Weng Wenhao and President Yu Hongjun jointly visited Mr. Song at Beijige and discussed for a long time. It was reported that an important meeting was held at the Executive Yuan's No. 1 official residence on the morning of the 8th, which was attended by President Weng and former Presidents Song Ziwen and Zhang Qun. At that time, it had been proven to be a rumor. It is learned that the new economic and financial plan of the Weng cabinet has been largely drafted after President Weng and the relevant heads discussed it in detail and consulted with the Quan Gan party's opinions. It can be submitted to the political affairs meeting for discussion and implementation.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Yuan Siyan, the Nanjing-based representative of the Guangdong Provincial Government, denied to reporters the reports in the Jinghu newspapers that Chairman Song's visit to Nanjing this time was related to economic reform and 美援 issues. He said that Chairman Song's visit to Nanjing this time was purely to report his work to President Chiang.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] President Yu Hongjun of the National Bank came to Nanjing from Shanghai last week and, together with President Weng and others, drafted a new economic and financial reform plan. As there are still important official duties in Shanghai that need to be dealt with urgently, he is scheduled to return to Shanghai by plane on the morning of the 9th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] On the 8th, the Jing Evening News reported that the authorities would summon people from the Shanghai business community to Nanjing to discuss the new economic and financial plan. On the evening of the 8th, an authoritative person denied this and solemnly pointed out that there was no such thing. He also said that many of the measures in the new economic reform plan are related to the gains and losses of industry and commerce, so it is important to maintain strict secrecy in advance. How could it be possible to discuss it with people in the business community beforehand? The report in the evening paper is absolutely untrue.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Former Premier Zhang Qun has been in Nanjing for two days and has been very busy meeting with various parties. He also visited the President for a long talk at 3 PM on the afternoon of the 8th. Further news: Mr. Zhang's future position has not yet been finalized. He was previously consulted about the idea of serving as the chairman of the Presidential Palace's National Policy Advisory Committee, but Mr. Zhang has not yet responded. It is now reported that he will be appointed to a position in the soon-to-be-established 美援 Rural Reconstruction Committee. There is also a saying that Mr. Zhang will be appointed, but there is no concrete confirmation of either. Mr. Zhang has also considered going to Japan to meet with MacArthur, but the departure date has not been set.

### Overall Review of the Battle Situation in the Past Half Year (Continued from Yesterday)

(6) Northeast Battle Situation The ambition of the Northeast Lin Biao bandits was to seize Changchun and Shenyang, two areas rich in politics and of strategic significance, in an attempt to realize the dream of Mao Zedong and Li Lisan's Asian Communist International Intelligence Bureau and the establishment of a pseudo-puppet organization. However, the National Army, by holding these two strategic strongholds, not only restrained the bandits' 500,000 elite troops, preventing them from moving freely, but also placed two time bombs, making international ambitious people hesitate. In addition to expanding the internal strife of the international fifth column of the Communist bandits, they never dared to learn the recklessness of the Japanese imperialists and swallow the Northeast in one bite. They struggled hard from last winter until now, only engaging in bandit-like harassment in the Rehe-Liaoning border area. However, the vast number of people in this area, who Mao Zedong, the bandit leader, called the "Liberation Army's" foundation, instead carried their young and supported their old in large numbers, trekking thousands of miles to embrace the motherland. So far, more than one million people have arrived in the Pingjin area alone, and the number of people who want to escape but cannot enter the pass is more than ten million. The hundreds of thousands of National Army troops in the Northeast remain steadfast and immovable, and the bandits can do nothing about it. This fact proves the shaking of the bandits' military foundation and the success of the National Army's strategic and political strategies.

(7) North China Battle Situation In the North China battlefield, the bandit troops under the direct command of bandit leaders Mao Zedong and Zhu De, such as Nie Rongzhen, Li Yunchang, He Long, and Xu Xiangqian, have been painstakingly plotting for the past six months to destroy several key transportation routes, such as the Ping-Sui, Ping-Gu, Ping-Bao, and Bei-Ning Roads, and the Jinpu section, so that the political and economic situation in North China would fall into a state of paralysis, thus facilitating the bandits' roving occupation. However, every time the bandits stirred, they were hit by the National Army's mobile strikes. From the defeat on the Pingbao Line in January this year, to the frustration and return after harassing the Pingsui Road in March, to the invasion of Chengde in May, which was defeated by our internal and external attacks, followed by harassment of the Pinggu Road, where nearly half of its Third Column was annihilated by us in the Pinggu area; in June, Nie Rongzhen, Li Yunchang, and other bandits jointly harassed the outer areas of Qinhuangdao, planning to destroy the Jinyu section of the railway, but in Anshan, Shimen, Changli, and other places, more than 5,000 people were killed by us. Thanks to the National Army's protection and the road workers' courageous repairs, the railway traffic situation is now very good. The facts prove that Nie's plot to destroy our transportation in North China has been crushed. However, the most meaningful victory is not only this, but also the National Army's control outside this transportation line and the打击on Nie's military strength. The various battles in the Jinbei area, the Jidong area, the Rehe-Liaoning border area, and the Jicha area have proved that the bandits' policy of "occupying the surface" and "cutting off the lines" has begun to fail, and the loss of combat power, in particular, has exceeded Nie's expectations.

(8) Northwest Battle Situation In the Northwest, after Peng Dehuai's bandit troops suffered setbacks last winter and failed to attack Yulin three times this spring, they changed their route and fled south after Mao's replenishment. At first, they launched a sneak attack on Yichuan, which succeeded for a while, but then, because the National Army adopted a mobile strategy and abandoned strongholds of lost strategic value, Peng Dehuai's main bandit force, about four columns, went deep into the area alone and was attracted to the Jingwei Jin Valley, where two-thirds were eliminated. Since the great victory in Longdong in early May, a solid foundation has been laid for the Northwest Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. The remnants of Peng's columns had to retreat and lurk in the Huanglong Mountains for rest and reorganization, and they are still being searched and suppressed by our army. The bandits' dream of expanding their roving operations in the Northwest will not be realized.

(9) Central China Battle Situation The success of the sweeping campaign in the Dabie Mountains in Central China shattered Liu Bocheng's plan to establish a base for southward advancement. They had no choice but to flee in embarrassment to the Funiu Mountains and Tongbai Mountains and join forces with Chen Geng. In the middle, they also joined forces with Chen Yi and Kong Congzhou, and briefly stirred up trouble outside Nanyang, attacking the Wanxi militia. However, in addition to occupying the mountainous area of Xixiakou, more than 20,000 bandits outside Nanyang were wiped out by the National Army. In the recent Yudu Campaign, Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, and local communists Jin Shaoshan, Wei Fenglou, and other 200,000 bandits concentrated their forces to counterattack in the Yellow River flooded area. As a result, in nine days of bloody fighting, more than 80,000 were killed or wounded, while we only suffered losses from one division and one brigade. The bandits were pursued and suppressed by our joint army and air force as they fled, and suffered heavy casualties. On the banks of the Yellow River in western Shandong, our army seized enough weapons from the bandits to form a brigade. Although Chen Yi's failure this year was not as severe as last year's in Shandong, he cannot immediately restore his original combat strength. In order to cover up his defeat, the bandits launched a sneak attack on Xiangyang, succeeding by luck, but it has now been recovered by the National Army.

(10) East China Battle Situation In East China, Chen Yi left the Second, Eleventh, and Twelfth Columns in northern Jiangsu. Since suffering heavy losses in the Yanfu area in early June, he once attempted to flee back to southern Shandong, but was blocked by the National Army in the A'hu and Xin'an areas. Only more than 1,000 people belonging to the Eleventh Column escaped back to southern Shandong. Although he has recently attempted to stir up trouble near Lianshui, Shuyang, and Suqian, since the implementation of total war in northern Jiangsu, the people and government forces have gradually become one, and there is strength to suppress bandits everywhere. The bandits' goal is to restrain and disperse our forces in many ways. However, as our people's self-defense forces become stronger and stronger, it will not be easy for the bandits to disperse the National Army's forces. As for central Shandong, although the bandits used the strength of the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Thirteenth Columns to first stir up trouble in Changli and Weixian, and recently captured Yanzhou, they are currently reorganizing and resting, and it is rumored that they will attack Jinan recently. If the battle situation develops to this point, the bandits in that area will be unable to escape the fate of being attacked by us from inside and outside.

(11) Comparison of Battle Results In the past six months, due to the National Army's change of strategy, great achievements have been made in annihilating the main force of the bandit army. Although in terms of territory, we recovered 65 important military towns and voluntarily abandoned 89 that were invaded by the bandits, it seems that the bandits have made some progress. However, the recent victory in Yudu is the best harvest of our concentrated use of mobile forces, and has given a heavy blow to the "living forces" of the international fifth column in China. As for the comparison of casualties between bandits and us, the ratio in the first half of the year was about one to three. The total number of bandit casualties was 710,572 (excluding the casualties of the great battle in the Yellow River flooded area in early July), while our army's casualties were only 232,851. During the same period, 44,680 bandits were captured, and 52,071 of our officers and soldiers were missing. Also, from January to May (June is still being counted), the battle results of our army were: 33,263 rifles and machine guns, 812 light machine guns, 126 heavy machine guns, 184 submachine guns, 755 pistols, 17 mountain and field guns, 51,153 hand grenades, 4,288 rounds of various artillery shells, and 489,258 rounds of various rifle bullets. Despite the fact that the bandits are issuing exaggerated and false propaganda figures every day to cheer up the fifth column underground elements lurking in the National Army's area, the eyes of the people of China are bright, and they are urgently demanding that the government strengthen its forces to quell the chaos. The Chinese people were able to defeat the Japanese invasion in the past, and of course they are even more determined and persevering to defeat the Communist bandits, the fifth column of the newly emerging imperialist, who are more ferocious than the Japanese.

Editorial

### Restoring Government Credit First! - Prerequisites for New Economic Measures -

The so-called "New Economic Measures Program" or "Economic Reform Program" has been rumored in recent days, sometimes saying it will be announced soon, and sometimes saying it may be postponed, and its content is even more varied. Recently, Song Ziwen, chairman of Guangdong Province, was summoned to fly from Guangzhou to Nanjing to consult with the president on this program. Yesterday afternoon, President Weng and others were meeting in Nanjing, which shows that no matter what the content of this program is or whether it has any novelty, it is probably something that exists.

To be honest, the recent economic situation is indeed causing President Weng of the current cabinet a great deal of trouble. Because on the one hand, the government is printing large amounts of currency and increasing its issuance, and on the other hand, it is selling materials and tightening credit, originally wanting to balance things out somewhat to avoid stimulating prices. However, materials cannot be recovered once they are sold, and the legal currency still has to be circulated after it is recovered; if credit is loose and excessive, prices will certainly rise, and if credit is tightened, prices will stop slightly but still rise. As a result, from the end of May to the end of July, in the space of two months, the official exchange rate of the US dollar increased by 9.3 times, the wholesale price of goods increased by 6.2 times, and the cost of living index increased by 4.5 times, setting a new record! Everyone cannot stand it, so they blame the current cabinet. The administrative authorities themselves cannot stand it either, so they have to formulate the so-called "New Economic Measures Program."

Although the rumors about this new economic policy have been rampant, the content is still unclear. Of course, we do not want to see the economic situation become more serious than it is now, nor do we want to recklessly criticize the future policies of the current cabinet, and even less do we want to imagine that the new policies cannot save the crisis. However, judging from the previous economic reforms, we feel that if the government authorities can still truly reflect and understand the way of governing, then before talking about all economic reforms and before boldly trying any new economic measures, they must first think about the issue of government credit. If the government still thinks that credit is not important, then even if any future reforms have good motives and intentions, and even if reforming the currency system may be an urgent need, under the premise of popular mistrust, I am afraid that they will still fall into a situation where one wrong move leads to complete failure. For the sake of the overall national situation, we really dare not refrain from saying a few honest words.

The two words "credit" are very difficult to build up but very easy to lose. Once lost, it is even more difficult to restore. This is true for individuals, families, and groups, and why is it not true for the government? We are repeating old things because we really feel sorry for the government! Before the War of Resistance, the government was quite capable of maintaining its credit. Even during the September 18th Incident, the government had "extraordinary" measures to reduce interest by half and postpone the repayment of principal on public bonds, but the people were motivated by hatred of the enemy and shared the same hatred, and everyone did not object but was happy to accept it. Fortunately, there were no more breaches of faith, so the credit of the National Government was maintained throughout, and the abolition of taels and the implementation of the legal currency policy were able to proceed unimpeded. When the War of Resistance was launched, the 500 million yuan Patriotic Public Bond was sold out without waiting for publicity. We should frankly admit that this is proof that the economic foundation of the War of Resistance was built on the government's credit. Subsequently, the government issued many public bonds and savings certificates in Chongqing, including US dollar public bonds and gold savings certificates, which were especially welcomed by the people. Unfortunately, the then administrative authority, President Song, did not know which narrow-minded wealth-gathering experts he was persuaded by, and also became "short-sighted," copying the old article of reducing interest by half from the September 18th Incident, repaying the principal and interest of the US dollar public bonds at the statutory exchange rate, and deducting 40% of the donation from the matured gold savings certificates. At the time, perhaps the advisers thought that it was a clever move and that the government could reduce an expenditure and save a sum of gold, but little did they know that the loss of credit is still affecting things today. Those wealth-gathering experts who offered advice should be ashamed!

The Chinese have always valued benevolence and charity, and it does not matter if they donate some money, especially in times of national crisis. However, they suffered a loss once and learned a lesson. After that, no matter how eloquently the government wants to solicit bonds from the people, the people will give the government a cold shoulder.

After the victory, the government knew that it could no longer issue public bonds casually, so it devoted all its efforts to selling gold and foreign exchange, thinking that the military situation could be successfully concluded within half a year to a year, and that it only needed to stabilize prices during this period. Of course, this was not necessarily a wrong view. Unfortunately, the government's military operations failed to end as scheduled, and its estimates were wrong. As a result, in less than a year, almost half of the gold was sold and the foreign exchange was almost sold out. This was not a policy mistake but an estimation error. The government did not lose credit in the two matters of selling gold and selling foreign exchange as it did in the past by deducting 40% of the gold for donations. However, it still cannot completely restore the people's trust in the government.

When the cabinet was reorganized and President Zhang took office, everyone thought that Zhang Gongquan, a financial expert, would once again pin his hopes on issuing public bonds. Since the US dollar was the most popular in the market, US dollar public bonds and US dollar treasury bills were issued side by side. Before the issuance, the president and vice president of the Central Bank would usually give a speech, and they seemed very sincere about maintaining the credit. The people also thought that the government might not lose credit again. Although they still maintained a wait-and-see attitude, they could not resist the repeated adjustments of the foreign exchange rate. Public bonds and treasury bills seemed to be profitable, and the government seemed to be able to keep its promises, so they were once again attracted. However, over time, the official foreign exchange rate became fixed, while the black market foreign exchange rate soared at the same time. The people were once again worried about how the principal and interest of the bonds would be settled. At the time, in order to absorb overseas remittances, encourage exports, and save the national treasury's figures for repaying the principal and interest of US dollar public bonds and treasury bills, the government invented a foreign exchange settlement certificate. Holders of public bonds and treasury bills said it was wrong. The bonds clearly stated that the principal and interest would be repaid according to the exchange rate listed by the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee. If the listed price does not move, why should there be an extra demand? The technical skill is admirable, but in the eyes of the people, the government will inevitably lose credit once again on the bonds!

We want to solemnly inform President Weng that the best way for the government to contract the currency is to increase legitimate tax revenue and issue public bonds, but both of these depend on the credit of the government's responsible personnel. Other measures such as selling materials and stopping loans are not the most effective ways to contract the currency. There is no need to explain the reasons, just look at the facts of the past year. In addition to reorganizing tax revenue, the government's only legitimate way to absorb idle funds in the market is to issue public bonds. Under favorable conditions, the people are happy to buy public bonds and securities from a credible government. This is true in China, and it is true in foreign countries. This was true in the past, and it will be true in the future. Unfortunately, government officials are often deceived by the eloquent words of those who like to make small calculations, suffer from shortsightedness, and unknowingly lose the government's credit in front of the people, which makes it difficult to continue issuing public bonds. Moreover, officials and clerks in the self-proclaimed economic control agencies who do not understand the overall situation insist on creating a panic in the stock market, so that the people are hesitant to buy securities. This is not only greedy for small gains but losing big ones, it is simply wanting to close the door to issuing public bonds and cutting off one's own path to survival.

The establishment of a constitutional government is, according to the old Chinese saying, originally a great opportunity to deeply "blame oneself," "start anew with the people," and restore government credit. Unfortunately, although the high-ranking officials have all read ten thousand books, they seem to have forgotten the old saying "A people without trust cannot stand." In order to make up for the deficit, they want to come up with some novel new tricks regardless of the constitutional provisions that the people's lives and property should be protected. They are still unwilling to honestly do one or two things to restore the government's great trust and save things from the root. We are afraid that we will one day cause a greater disaster, but we sincerely hope that our words will not come true.

We also know very well that the highest authorities are concerned about the seriousness of the national financial and economic situation, and are diligently seeking advice, hoping that the government can have a refreshing measure to save the impending crisis. Not to mention the responsible government officials, even ordinary people are discussing on their own, wanting to make a contribution of a thousand thoughts from a fool. However, we still believe that the most fundamental prerequisite problem is restoring government credit is the first step. If credit is not taken into account, it is useless to merge banks and money shops, or order money shops to suspend business for a certain period of time, nationalize gold, inspect warehouses, and even forcibly open safe deposit boxes. All of these new tricks are unworkable and only obstacles that lose popular support. If you want to use these methods as preparation for reforming the currency system, that is even a bigger joke! Moreover, what is the use of arbitrarily changing the unit of currency before credit is restored? We dare to boldly say one sentence: If the government has credit, it can issue public bonds; if the government has credit, it can immediately stop increasing the issuance of currency; if the government has credit, it can open up sources of income and make up for the deficit in the national budget; if the government has credit, it can get the full support of the people and quell the bandits' rebellion as soon as possible. Everything, everything, starts with restoring credit. Do not regard it as an old saying! With the large population, vast land, rich resources, and friendly assistance of China, if the government has credit, how difficult is it to walk the path of self-reliance? Whether the government is really willing to take this bright and spacious road and not arbitrarily walk on side paths or demonic paths, we will predict it from its future actions.

### Huang Gongzong Director Chen Panling Talks About This Year's Most Tense Huang Flood - Hope That All Parties Will Assist In This Difficulty

[Central News Agency Kaifeng, 8th] Huanghe River Repair and Prevention Project is most serious every flood season. The reporter interviewed Chen Panling, Director of Huanghe River Engineering Bureau, to understand this year's flood prevention situation. He said: Although Huang's flood is tense every year, it has never been as severe as this year. (1) Last year, the river water initially returned to its original course, and the flow was slow, resulting in silting up of the riverbed. This year the Yongwei increase is high. (2) Based on past experience, this year's river water should be larger than last year. Last year, the maximum flow did not exceed 15,000 cubic meters per second. (3) This year's flood prevention conditions are far inferior to last year's, because (A) The embankment from Quxingji in Henan Province to Dongzhuang section in western Shandong is fragile, and construction has not been able to start since last winter due to bandit disturbances. (B) During this bandit attack on Kaifeng, the materials and tools of this Bureau and the repair and prevention offices of Hebei and Henan provinces were almost completely lost. All the section team materials and equipment along the river from Yangqiao Dangerous Work in Henan Province to Dongzhuang Dangerous Work in Shandong Province were also looted. (C) This year's flood prevention fee was originally budgeted by this Bureau at 300 billion based on March prices. According to the current situation, it must be increased by at least ten times. Moreover, this Bureau and various repair and prevention offices have lost everything, and a huge amount of money is needed to replenish them. As of today, the central government has only successively allocated 50 billion yuan for repair and prevention fees, which is far from enough. (D) The major flood season has arrived in the past month, and rescue work has been repeatedly obstructed by bandits. On June 15, the war in western Shandong intensified, and employees were forced to withdraw. Eighteen employees and 232 laborers were captured en route. There have also been frequent casualties elsewhere. In short, this year's flood season has arrived, and the river water is gradually increasing, with a flow rate of 6,000+ cubic meters per second. I hope that all parties will give full assistance in order to get through this difficult time.

### Largest Building in Taiwan Province, Provincial Government Building, to Be Completed Next Month

[Central News Agency, Taipei, August 8th] The construction of the Taiwan Provincial Government Building, which began repairs last September, was originally scheduled to be completed in a year and a half, but will now be completed next month ahead of schedule. This is the largest building in Taiwan Province. It was formerly the Japanese Governor-General's Office in Taiwan, built by the Japanese over a period of ten years in the Late Renaissance style with five stories. During the war, it was bombed by Allied aircraft, taking direct hits, and over 83% of it was destroyed by fire, leaving only ruins. After the building is completed next month, it will first be used as the venue for the Provincial Exposition on the third anniversary of Taiwan's Retrocession (i.e., October 25th). The scale of this year's exposition will be much larger than last year's, and the exhibits will be divided into twelve groups. Collection has already begun. The National Engineers Annual Meeting is also scheduled to be held here on October 25th.

### Soviet Firmly Opposes Extending Danube River Convention; British Request for International Arbitration Rejected

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, August 7th] The Danube River Conference today rejected by a vote of seven to three the British proposal to ask the International Court of Justice in The Hague or the United Nations Secretariat to arbitrate whether the 1921 Danube River Convention should be extended. Britain, the United States, and France voted in favor, while Eastern European countries voted against. During the debate, US Representative Cannon strongly argued that the US draft would better guarantee freedom of navigation on the Danube than the Soviet draft. After Britain's request for arbitration by The Hague or the United Nations was proposed, the US and French representatives strongly supported it. The French representative even said that if the conference rejected arbitration, France would refuse to accept the conference's decision. Soviet Representative Vyshinsky strongly argued that there was no legal issue that needed arbitration. He flatly refused to consider the 1921 convention and emphasized that "the Four Powers Conference of 1946 has given the current Danube River Conference full powers to draft a new convention, and its qualifications are beyond doubt." The conference also rejected the French proposal to open the conference to reporters by a vote of seven to three, but passed a resolution allowing each delegation to freely report on the progress of the conference to reporters.

### Four Powers to Continue Talks to Resolve German Problem; West German People Deeply Fear Becoming "Munich Second"

[Agence France-Presse, London, August 7th] Well-informed sources say that if the talks currently being conducted in Moscow by the special envoys of the three Western powers and the Soviet Union reach an agreement, the matters to be carried out by both sides thereafter will be roughly as follows: (1) The Berlin dispute will be resolved on the spot through negotiations by the Allied commanders-in-chief in Germany; (2) A Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference will be held in Paris in September, simultaneously with the UN General Assembly; (3) This conference will be thoroughly prepared to avoid the stalemates of previous conferences; (4) Sources here believe that the chance of success depends less on initial concessions than on the willingness of both sides to reach an agreement.

The same sources predict that neither the three Western powers nor the Soviet Union is willing to show any trump cards before the conference is held. For example, even if the original state of Berlin is restored, the three powers will still not allow the Soviet Union to participate in the control of the Ruhr. Similarly, the Soviet Union will not allow the three Western powers to inspect the Soviet occupation zone. Although a general agreement on the German problem is difficult to reach for the time being, these well-informed sources point out that even if smaller points can be agreed upon in an atmosphere of mutual goodwill, mutual trust can be restored, which is necessary to overcome current difficulties.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, August 7th] The German Telegraphic News, which is permitted to be published in the British sector, warned in an editorial today that the Moscow conference will become a "Munich Conference Second." The editorial stated that the meetings currently being held in Moscow make us fear that they will become a continuation of the Munich Conference, but this phenomenon must be avoided, because this path will make it impossible to solve the German problem. Although the Soviet Union is slightly stalemated in Berlin, if the Western Allies make concessions to the Soviet Union in its many advantages in various regions without careful consideration in advance, the position of the Western Allies will be destroyed as a result.

### American Business Weekly Article Estimates Soviet Strength

[Central News Agency, New York, August 8th] American Business Weekly published an article estimating the economic and military strength of the Soviet Union. Its conclusion is that the economic impact of the Soviet Union in the event of a Third World War would be "to return millions of Soviets to a barbaric and starving existence." The magazine believes that the sacrifices that another war would impose on the Soviet people would be unimaginable to the average American. The following statistics are just a few examples: (1) Housing Problem: The Soviet Union had 25 million homes destroyed by the Germans during World War II, but its construction industry has been slow to develop, because factories and offices have priority access to building materials, even the families of Soviet industry personnel cannot find a large room in public housing.

(2) Low Production of Consumer Goods: According to several successive Five-Year Plans in the Soviet Union, the focus is on expanding the automotive industry, and its consumer goods industry has been greatly affected. At the end of World War II, Soviet heavy industry was close to pre-war levels, but the living standards of the Soviet people were lower than 20 years ago, so they were very afraid of another war. All of this proves that the primary goal of the Soviet Union is to build a war industry that is equal to the United States, regardless of the losses suffered by the people. If a third world war occurs, the Soviet Union will exhaust the manpower and material resources of the Eurasian continent under its control for its heavy industry needs. The Soviet leaders, who have unhesitatingly caused millions of peasants to cry out and suffer from the cold while carrying out agricultural reforms for 30 years, will still not hesitate to starve millions of people in Europe and its own country if they believe it will contribute to their war victory. Therefore, the magazine stated that we can predict the future situation, that is, the people of Europe and the Soviet Union will undoubtedly enter a new dark age of terror.

### US Congress Adjourns After Passing Three Bills

Most of Truman's Proposals Rejected

[Central News Agency, Washington, August 7th] The special session of Congress adjourned today after completing action on the mildly tempered inflation control bill and the revised housing measures. This special meeting was convened by President Truman in a declaration at the Democratic National Convention to take action on its eighteen-bell emergency legislative program. But the only proposal fully passed by Congress was a bill appropriating $65 million to lend to the United Nations to build its headquarters. Republican senators defeated Democratic efforts to incorporate Truman's wage and price control proposals into their inflation control bill. The House also rejected a provision in the bill to increase the reserve requirements of Federal Reserve banks. The Senate also changed the percentage by which bank reserve requirements would be increased. In order to allow Congress to adjourn quickly, the House has passed the Senate's amendments. The limited inflation control passed by Congress restores wartime regulations on installment purchases and provides for a 4 percent increase in the reserve requirements for bank demand deposits and a 1.5 percent increase in the reserve requirements for time deposits. The House also passed the Senate-approved housing bill, but it did not include Truman's urging to build low-cost public housing and eliminate slums. This bill has been sent to the White House along with the inflation control bill for the President to sign. In addition to passing the above three bills, Congress also appropriated funds to make up for the shortfalls of the Federal Housing Administration and the Veterans Administration. Republican lawmakers largely despised Truman and rejected almost all of his proposals. However, there were also many members who wanted Congress to take more effective action on high prices and housing problems. Although Truman can reconvene Congress, it is highly questionable whether he will do so. Truman has now submitted his emergency plan to Congress and will intensify his attacks on Congress to pursue his election campaign. Democratic National Committee Chairman McGlak said that since the Republican-controlled Congress did not pass an effective plan to curb inflation at the special session, the American people could elect Truman in November and elect a Democratic-led Congress that would not be threatened by rising prices again.

### French Financial Plan: Parliament Begins Debate

Finance Committee Has Already Revised and Passed It

[Central News Agency, Basel, 7th] French Finance Minister René Pleven recently told the National Assembly that from now until the end of this year and the national budget for next year, there will be a deficit of tens of billions of francs. Pleven's remarks are generally regarded as a bitter pill offered to the parliament. Various political groups thoroughly reviewed Pleven's financial plan overnight. The Socialist Party may accept this plan under the pretext of seeking freedom for France, as this plan would prevent the resurgence of the Gaullist faction. Some members of the Popular Republican Movement will refuse to vote in favor of this plan with their party members. Communist members are particularly vehemently opposed to this plan. It is widely believed that the parliament will begin debate this afternoon.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] The Finance Committee of the French National Assembly today passed many provisions of the financial and economic bill requesting special powers from Finance Minister René Pleven, but with significant amendments. The committee refused to grant the government the power to modify tax burdens and fixed rates. Pleven is prepared to accept the committee's desired changes to the wording, as requesting a vote of confidence or retaining all essential points of the original text would endanger the government's existence. At the same time, left-wing groups have joined yesterday's protest by the Communist Party, denouncing Pleven's plan as unconstitutional.

### West Berlin Gas and Electricity Supply Further Reduced

[United Press, Berlin, 7th] The British, American, and French occupying forces commanders ordered on the 7th to further reduce the gas and electricity supply to West Berlin by 50%, which will reduce the coal used for gas supply in Berlin to 1,300 tons per day. The electricity needed for daily cooking will be reduced by half, and household gas will be completely stopped from 9:00 PM to 5:00 AM every day. This restriction is even stricter than wartime levels, but the suffering of Berlin residents is not limited to this. The Soviet puppet administrators admitted that the food supply in the Soviet occupation zone is deteriorating. The food riots that were a cause for concern earlier this week have been suppressed, but only after the Soviets sent several truckloads of grain to the main trouble spots. German officials in the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin told the Berlin press that it would take another five to six weeks before all food ration cards could be fully implemented. At the same time, in order to ease the confusion of the two currencies in Berlin, Western countries are preparing to airlift 25 million West Marks to Berlin, and will first distribute 100 Marks of new salary to each factory employee, as the factories have been in arrears for two weeks.

### Italian General Confederation of Labor Splits

[United Press, Rome, 7th] The Italian Communist Party on the 7th accused the powerful Catholic Action organization of supporting anti-communist unions to secede from the General Confederation of Labor and spreading religious intolerance. The left-wing controlled Labor Confederation formally dismissed all Christian Democratic union leaders on the evening of the 6th, splitting the labor organization into pro-communist and anti-communist groups. The Communist Party's organ, "Unità," editorialized, accusing Catholic Action of "spreading discord and chaos" with the aim of strengthening the Church's power and its organization within the classes. The article was signed by D'Annini, who formerly served as ambassador to Moscow and was dismissed by the government for leaving his post without permission in March to return to Italy to engage in Communist Party election campaigns.

### Lie Submits United Nations Budget to General Assembly

[Central News Agency, New York, 8th] United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie submitted a budget proposal of $33,469,587 for the United Nations next year, $1,355,608 less than this year's budget ($34,825,195). Lie's proposal is outlined in his budget report submitted to the upcoming United Nations General Assembly in Basel.

### One of the Preludes to the US General Election: The Birth of the Fourth Party

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in the United States, Mao Shuqing

New York Airmail: The split within the Democratic Party will undoubtedly create a sure victory for the Republican Party in November. Today, any politically savvy observer believes that Dewey will be the master of the White House next year, without a doubt. During the Third Party convention in Philadelphia, Wallace's campaign manager, Paul Baldwin, said: "Truman is a complete idiot; he completely betrayed Roosevelt's consistent policies." Baldwin also said: "President Roosevelt sincerely said two weeks before his death that the Democratic Party needs Wallace, especially in today (1945) in this extraordinary situation!"

But "unfortunately," Wallace was not the Vice President in 1945. By some mischance, today's major split in the Democratic Party was created. Baldwin said: "The split will undoubtedly lead to Dewey's victory, but we (referring to the Third Party) must raise this banner. The Third Party's opportunity is in 1952 or 1956!"

Will the United States need Wallace by then? At least for now, this question cannot be answered. Originally, the split of the Democratic Party did not begin today. In my correspondence to this newspaper in 1946, I repeatedly mentioned the separation of the left and right wings of the Democratic Party. At that time, Wallace was still the dignified Secretary of Commerce, and Labor Secretary Schlenbach had not yet passed away. Two years later, the Democratic Party did not expect to turn into such a major divided situation. In addition to Wallace's Third Party (Progressive Party), there is also a Fourth Party (Jefferson Democratic Party). The Democratic Party's presidential and vice-presidential candidates total six: Truman and Barkley as a group, Wallace and Taylor as a group, and Hammond and Launt as another group.

Thurmond is the governor of South Carolina, and Wright is the governor of Mississippi. They are both typical Southerners. They represent the interests of the American South. Most of their proposals are still the proposals of the South during the American Civil War era. When the Democratic Party National Convention was held in Philadelphia on July 12, the official declaration of the Democratic Party put forward the platform and policies for the election. Truman and the leaders of several northern states decided on a chapter called "National Basic Rights": (1) The Democratic Party firmly advocates the abolition of "lynching"; (2) Opposition to unreasonable poll taxes; (3) Opposition to racial discrimination; (4) Equal national employment opportunities. These items were strongly opposed by representatives from several southern states. Dixon, the former governor of Alabama, proposed an amendment, advocating the removal of these mandatory provisions, respecting the local powers of each state, raising the powers of state governments and state legislatures, and handling matters separately in accordance with local conditions in various places. Alabama's amendment was rejected in the convention by a vote of 925 to 309, causing fury and resentment among the southern representatives. When Pennsylvania Senator Myers read the convention declaration, representatives from Mississippi first left the venue, and representatives from Alabama and other six southern states followed, staging a tragic second split in the Democratic Party.

Historically, the American Democratic Party originated in the South, and the South is the Democratic Party's old base. When the Fourth Party, the Jefferson Democratic Party's National Convention, was held in Birmingham, Alabama, a big businessman from Birmingham, Mr. Standard said: "The Southern Democrats are very angry at the strong and domineering occupation by the Northern representatives. Southern party members believe that the son is kicking out the mother." In Chinese, it's like "forgetting one's ancestors." These are just the intuitive thoughts of the three businessmen. I think what Dixon (former governor of Alabama) said at the convention was very concrete. He said: The northern Democrats do not understand the special environment of the several southern states. They are raping the public will of the southern people, preparing to create a social revolution in the South. This revolution will inevitably lead to bloodshed and chaos, and will destroy the stability of southern society.

He also said: The southerners do not not respect human rights. Regarding racial equality, religious freedom, etc., there are few explicit provisions in the American Constitution. The southern people have always adhered to the Constitution. Why should Truman "go to the trouble?" Then, Mississippi Governor Wright called on all men and women who advocate upholding the autonomy rights of the states and who oppose Truman to gather under the banner of the Birmingham convention!"

The banner of the "Confederacy" from the Civil War era flew in Birmingham. In the past eighty years, the United States has made progress in various aspects, but this "black problem" will always become a hidden danger for the country. The black problem caused racial discrimination, which affected the legislation of various states, and was linked to the debate between "federal centralization" and "confederate system," which is why there was the "Civil War" during the Lincoln era. Unexpectedly, eighty years after the end of the Civil War, a huge portrait of General Lee, a hero of the Civil War, appeared on the streets of Birmingham again.

The Birmingham convention also elected presidential and vice-presidential candidates. Originally, it was planned to elect Arkansas Governor Laney, a famous tough guy and a typical "southern type," as the presidential candidate. His "not giving face" to President Truman won a lot of cheers from the southerners. However, later, due to differences of opinion, Laney was unwilling to be nominated as the presidential candidate, and it was temporarily decided to change the nomination to Thurmond and Wright.

The Fourth Party expects to win all the southern votes in the November election, and some even believe that it can win the votes of the Midwest, such as Oklahoma, Indiana, and even President Truman's hometown of Missouri. However, some people also think that we should not be too optimistic. Alabama Democratic Party Chairman McCoy Fan advocated at the convention that Southerners should not show their shame. He believes that to elect a prestigious person like Eisenhower as the presidential candidate of the Fourth Party can win the victory in November. He believes that we should never nominate people from our own small circle, because we cannot win a national victory. McCoy Fan's opinion was not accepted by the convention.

There are also southern people who fundamentally oppose the "rebellion meeting" in Birmingham. Georgia Senator Russell is one of the most powerful ones. Russell received 263 votes in the presidential candidate vote at the Democratic Party convention in Philadelphia, a highly respected political figure in the South. He opposed the split of the party, saying, "I oppose Truman, and I will oppose him in the Senate seat. I will not participate in the traitor meeting!"

When Truman returned to the White House triumphantly from Philadelphia and announced the news of convening a special session of Congress, reporters found Russell, who said humorously: "Another unfortunate event for the Democratic Party!"

### Chairman of US Espionage Case Investigation Committee Accuses Truman of Blocking Information, Will File Charges and Ask President to Explain

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] Senator Ferguson, chairman of the Senate committee investigating the government's "loyalty" program, claimed today that he will accuse President Truman of intolerable presidential arrogance for refusing to provide important information to Congress. Truman refused to provide the investigating committee with loyalty information about Remington, a former official of the wartime Production Board, who has been accused of being a member of a Soviet spy network.

[United Press, Washington, 7th] Senator Ferguson stated in a speech in the Senate on the 7th that Congress is being forced into an intolerable position, either blindly passing legislation or forcing the President to explain his actions in the Communist case investigation. Ferguson accused Truman of refusing this week to hand over to congressional investigators the records of the loyalty investigation of federal government employees who are currently involved in the Communist espionage case. Ferguson spoke in his capacity as chairman of the Senate investigation committee. Ferguson's remarks may be the most severe attack on the President since he took office in April 1945. He stated that Congress must come to a showdown with Truman, as the President's arrogance has reached an intolerable level. It is reported that Truman said on the 5th that Ferguson's investigation committee's review of the espionage case and the House Un-American Activities Committee's hearing of Communist statements are aimed at making people forget that Congress refused to pass his anti-inflation proposals and other proposals. Truman resolutely refused to give any federal government employees' loyalty investigation records to the two committees. Ferguson accused the President and his administration of attempting to conceal their mistakes. He also stated that Congress had allocated 11 million US dollars to complete the government employee loyalty investigation record plan, so it has the right to know how this matter is progressing. Ferguson further stated that the relationship between the President and Congress has reached a tense limit due to secrecy.

New "Mysterious Witness" Reports Today

[United Press, New York, 7th] The House subcommittee responsible for investigating a Communist spy group that infiltrated the federal government during the war subpoenaed Brotman, a former leader of the American Communist Party who recently requested to rejoin the Communist Party National Convention but was rejected, on the 7th, but he is not the "mysterious witness" in the investigators' mouths. According to official sources, this "mysterious witness" will be Golyeor, a former communist who will publicly report the whole story in Washington on the 9th.

Madder, the acting chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee in Washington, said: The subcommittee has arrived here specifically to question Golyeor. Later, he also said: A certain Soviet female teacher will be absent from the inquiry. She is currently at the center of a debate between the Soviet Consulate and an anti-Soviet group over the issue of being "kidnapped." Golyeor was secretly questioned by the subcommittee in the Federal Building on the evening of the 6th. Congressman Nixon said: "She is the most important of any witness we have subpoenaed." Madder had also previously stated in Washington that this mysterious witness "will be able to provide the committee with valuable and direct information. Regarding a person who has been in contact with a Communist spy group, this Communist spy group is also able to meet with the core Communist figures. We have reason to believe that this person is working inside the spy group and is also the only person who can contact the inside of the spy group. As for whether this person is still working in the government, I cannot say."

Soviet Female Teacher Kidnapped, Case Extremely Bizarre

[United Press, New York, 7th] New York Soviet Consul General Lomokin hid a Soviet female teacher in the consulate on the 7th, and claimed that he had rescued her from the White Russian kidnappers who forced her to confess. However, the leader of the congressional spy investigation immediately stated that she was the key witness they had been searching for for many days. Lomokin claimed that the female teacher was kidnapped in New York on July 31, when she was preparing to leave for the Soviet Union. Lomokin claimed that he rescued her on the 7th from a farm 75 miles away. The woman's name is Gorsonkina, who previously taught the children of Soviet diplomats in New York. Lomokin also condemned Leo Tolstoy, the daughter of the great Soviet writer Tolstoy, for assisting in the kidnapping. He claimed that another Soviet teacher and his wife and children are still being held by "White Russian bandits" in New Jersey. However, Miss Leo Tolstoy said that Gorsonkina went to the Tolstoy farm voluntarily. She was afraid of being murdered by Soviet officials, like her husband. "She was very happy when she stayed on the farm," but when she saw the consul's car coming, she started to tremble and said, "She will find a way to come back." Miss Tolstoy also strongly condemned Lomokin's statement as "a bunch of nonsense." Mrs. Gorsonkina appeared at a press conference held at Lomokin's consulate on the 7th. She said: "The food provided and the treatment received were good when she stayed on the farm, but she was forced to work in the kitchen."

### Poland and Czechoslovakia Promote Economic Cooperation

Resolution Passed at Warsaw Conference

[TASS, Warsaw, 7th] The Polish-Czech Economic Cooperation Conference was held in Warsaw from the 4th to the 6th of this month. In its resolution, the conference emphasized the need to promote Polish-Czech economic cooperation, especially in manufacturing and production. It is planned to conclude a five-year trade agreement this year. According to the new agreement, the trade volume between Poland and Czechoslovakia will reach 9 billion or 10 billion crowns (Czech currency) by 1953. Large factories are planned to be built to meet the needs of both countries, and plans have been made to jointly develop resources and build gas and electricity networks. It has also been decided to increase the volume of railway, inland river and sea freight. The Polish-Czech Economic Cooperation Conference agreed to establish an adjustment system for long-term economic plans between the two countries.

### Iranian King Visits Nice

### Israel Seeks Peace, Possibly Exploratory in Nature

Arab League's Reply May Be Pessimistic

[Agence France-Presse, Rhodes, 7th] Israel's proposal to start peace talks was delivered to the Arab countries by UN mediator Bernadotte yesterday afternoon. According to people close to Bernadotte, the Arab response may be pessimistic. Some observers here suspect that the so-called peace talk proposal is essentially a means of testing the Arab attitude, as if the Arab countries accept the peace talks proposed by Israel, it will be tantamount to recognizing the State of Israel "in fact," and the Arab League has so far refused to consider recognizing Israel. People close to Bernadotte believe that even if the Arab countries accept the proposal for peace talks, the peace talks will inevitably be fruitless. Although Bernadotte expressed optimism about his mission, believing that a peaceful solution to the Palestinian issue can eventually be found, some people close to Bernadotte are quite doubtful about the possibility of war not reigniting.

### Japanese Prime Minister Ashida Still Emphasizes the Middle Road

Believes That Left and Right Leanings Are Both Detrimental to Japan

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Ashida, Kurisu, and others, who were traveling in the northeastern regions, met with local reporters at Odate Station yesterday morning and said: "Currently, Japan's political situation is that on the one hand, the extremely left-wing tendency is very dangerous, and at the same time, the extremely right-wing tendency is also quite strong. Both of these will hinder Japan's future, so the advocacy of middle-of-the-road politics is very necessary. In the future, those who will take on this political responsibility will be the Central League or the Central Party. After returning to Tokyo, I will immediately engage in this political organization of the Central League that adopts the middle road."

### Laurent Will Succeed King as Prime Minister of Canada

[Agence France-Presse, Ottawa, 7th] Canadian Undersecretary of State for External Affairs Laurent was elected Chairman of the Liberal Party by the Liberal Party Congress today, receiving 848 votes. According to Canadian tradition, the leader of the majority party will be elected as Prime Minister, so Laurent will now be the Chairman of the Liberal Party and will succeed King as Prime Minister. This congress was convened specifically at King's request, because King has been in office for 21 years and intends to resign before Parliament reconvenes in January next year. Laurent is 66 years old this year. He entered politics in 1941 and advocates close military cooperation between Canada and the United States, and Canada's participation in any collective security convention to link the United States and Western European countries.

### US Department of Defense Requests Fortification of the Aleutian Islands, Marine Corps Strength Increased

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th, United Press] US Undersecretary of the Interior Warner recently stated that the US Department of Defense will definitely obtain the Aleutian Islands it hopes for as a military base. Warner continued, although the formal resolution to transfer the Aleutian Islands, which are currently under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior, to the Department of Defense has not yet been made, the latter will definitely get what it wants. Warner continued, when reviewing the Alaska issue and during subsequent consultations, the US Army, Navy, and Air Force hardly mentioned how they would use the area, except to apply for the above-mentioned area "as a base that is necessary to ensure the minimum national defense security of the United States."

The Army and Air Force requested all of Adak Island, Bremner Island, Sitkin, Shamya Islands, Atchitka Island, Atka Island, Umnak Island, Unalaska Islands, and a part of Cold Bay. The Navy requested Attu Island, Tanaga Island, Unalaska Island, Yakutat Island and other areas.

### Malayan Government Warrants Dayak Rebel Leaders

Viet Minh Troops Attack French Forces Twice

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 7th] Malayan Regional Officer General Boler said today that he is now considering moving the Dayak people of Borneo to the Malayan Federation to assist in the suppression of rebels in the area. These Dayaks were a large part of the personnel who formed the anti-Japanese movement in Borneo. The authorities here are now offering a reward for the arrest of more than 25 of the rebel leaders. Boler also declared that the rebels first attempted to establish a communist republic in the mountainous area of ​​Mount Gelian in southern Kelantan and other places, but failed due to excessive losses. Boler said that the current purpose of the suppression operation is to eliminate the banditry in this area and re-establish the authority of the authorities. (This area is where the Communist Party hopes to establish its first republic.) Mount Gelian and Plai are now under government control, and troops have also entered Plai. All suppression operations have encountered strong resistance from the enemy. (Plai is the second territory the rebels want to occupy in Malaya. Their first territory is Kayanger in southern Kelantan, where enemy leader Lowry was killed.) Boler concluded: Mortars were also used in the initial battle to annihilate the enemy in southern Kelantan.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 7th, United Press] Agence France-Presse reported on the 7th that Viet Minh troops attacked Vietnamese and French ground equipment in Hanoi with grenades and rifles. 300 Viet Minh troops were defeated south of Hanoi while attempting to cut the railway line.

### The Soviet Union is Vigorously Establishing a Vast War Machine; Heavy Industry Center Moves to Siberia

[Central News Agency, New York, August 8th] The current issue of Life magazine published this week features a special report on the Soviet economy and military strength, based on previously released data. The information is the result of several months of diligent investigation by experts, or revealed by sources who cannot be directly identified. The conclusion of Life magazine's report is that the Soviet Union is establishing a vast organization dedicated to war. The center for the construction of Soviet heavy industry has gradually shifted to Siberia. The report also states that the Soviet Union is planning large-scale industrial facilities north of Lake Baikal and near the Pacific coast. If the Soviet Union completes its Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1950, it can still wage war centered in Siberia, even if it loses its western territories. The Soviet Union is currently building large-scale ironworks north of Lake Baikal, where coal is abundant and pig iron is of high quality. The Soviet Union is also establishing industrial facilities near Alma-Ata, adjacent to Xinjiang, China, to mine uranium. At the same time, new industrial facilities have also been established north of Khabarovsk and Vladivostok. The crucial significance of Soviet development of Siberia is to make it an industrial fortress that can supply the needs of a massive army and is difficult to bomb. Regarding the Soviet Union's military strength, Life magazine believes that even without the atomic bomb, its military power is considerable. In terms of its army, the Soviet Union possesses the world's largest standing army; in terms of its air force, it has 14,000 aircraft; its navy is currently planning to expand its submarine fleet. The Soviet Union's production volume in heavy industry has now reached or exceeded its 1940 level.

### The British "Trades Union Congress"

— Our Correspondent in England, Ben Geng

The Labour Party is in power in Britain today, and the Labour Party has two organizations as its cornerstones. One is the Fabian Society; (Fabian Society) which has already been briefly introduced, and the other is the "Trades Union Congress." This is what I intend to briefly describe in this article.

(I)

Britain is the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, so not only does the "working class movement" have a long history, but so does the trade union organization. However, as for the origin of the current "Trades Union Congress," the first "Trades Union Congress" was the Congress held in Manchester in 1866. A total of thirty-four delegates attended this meeting, representing 118,367 workers. In 1869, the Trades Union Congress discussed the issue of labor representatives in Parliament and organized a committee to implement the Congress's resolutions. Since then, the Trades Union Congress has continued to discuss issues related to social legislation. In 1886, a Labor Election Committee was organized, but this committee was influenced by "Liberal" elements. In 1890, the Trades Union Congress passed a resolution in favor of the "Eight-Hour Workday Bill," and it could perhaps be said that from this time on, it began to abandon economic individualism and move towards socialism. The aforementioned Labor Election Committee ceased its activities in 1893. In 1899, a resolution was passed to engage in socialist organization, which resulted in the creation of the "Labour Representation Committee" and the founding of the Labour Party the following year.

(II)

The Labour Party is a political organization, while the Trades Union Congress, although also containing a political element, should be considered a professional organization. Although the emergence of the Labour Party relied on the Trades Union Congress, the two are not the same thing, but the relationship between the two is very close. The Labour Party was formed in 1900, and since 1905, there has been a joint committee, jointly organized by the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party, and the then "Trades Union Alliance" (this alliance was also supported by the Trades Union Congress). In 1914, the Trades Union Congress decided to reorganize this institution. In 1919, the Trades Union Congress passed a plan, deciding on the one hand to expand its internal executive body, and on the other hand to decide on a method for joint organization with the Labour Party. In 1920 and 1921, the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party Congresses both accepted the joint approach one after another, establishing a joint organization consisting of personnel sent by both sides. Therefore, the relationship between the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party can perhaps be said to be a horizontal relationship rather than a vertical relationship.

(III)

The Trades Union Congress has held a total of seventy-nine congresses from 1868 to 1947, and the number of workers it represents has been constantly increasing. In 1868, it was 28,367 people, in 1900 it was 1,200,000 people, in 1928 it was 3,874,842 people, and in 1945 it was 6,575,654 people. At the 79th Congress in 1947, there were 837 delegates, representing 187 trade unions in 18 major categories, and 7,540,397 workers. (The figures in this paragraph are based on the 79th report of the Trades Union Congress) With so many workers, its strength is naturally considerable.

In addition, we have seen that the total number of Labour Party members and the number of trade union workers participating in the Labour Party have been increasing year by year, and we can say with certainty that not only is there a close connection between the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress, but also, due to the large number of trade union members participating in the Labour Party and the high percentage of total Labour Party members they represent, one can imagine what kind of relationship the two have. Last year, the number of Labour Party members set a new record, but we should note that compared to the number of members in 1946, the number of members in 1947 (4,685,659 people) increased by 1,363,3018, but the number of trade union members participating in the Labour Party increased by 1,396,088 people. In other words, the number of ordinary party members decreased, which shows where the foundation of the Labour Party lies. It is no wonder that many policies of the Labour government must have the consent of the Trades Union Congress. Some people think that the Labour Party is an organization of intellectuals because the Fabian Society has many intellectuals, but after seeing this number, one can understand. This also gives some enlightenment to those who are interested in politics: any political party that wants to develop and wants to govern certainly needs intellectuals, but even more important is the common people. The total population of Britain, including men, women, old and young, is only between 45 million and 50 million, and more than 4.6 million is about one-tenth of the total number, but what we should understand is that the quality represented by this one-tenth is very important. If children are excluded, then the proportion it occupies is naturally more than one-tenth. If such a political party is led properly, it should have a future. (Sent from London on June 5)

### Tragic Accident in Baoshan Road During Thunderstorm: 90 Casualties at Yongbei Factory; Workers Unable to Escape Electrocution and Fire

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday at 3:20 PM, amidst heavy rain and thunder, a tragic accident occurred at the Yongbei Underwear Factory, No. 393 Baoshan Road, Zhabei, involving electrocution and fire caused by a lightning strike, resulting in as many as 90 casualties, accounting for more than 80% of the factory's employees, which is truly shocking.

The Yongbei Factory building has a total of five floors, with a relatively solid structure, and has been newly repaired, but the factory has no lightning protection equipment. Yesterday's tragedy originated in the sewing room on the second floor of the factory. The sewing room usually has 53 male workers, divided into four tables, with four electric irons installed. There are also two electric motors nearby, which consume the most electricity in the factory. At 3:20 PM, heavy rain poured down, and lightning struck. The entire power line was suddenly hit by lightning and fire, and it burned fiercely. All the workers were unable to escape and were burned, crying out for help. The noise was heard outside. At the time, there were also 11 female workers sewing buttons on the third floor, and more than 10 male workers were scraping paste. The fourth floor was the sorting room, with more than 20 male workers. The fifth floor was a dormitory. The power line also spread to the third and fourth floors, and the male and female workers on the third and fourth floors were unable to get downstairs and jumped from the windows to the road, resulting in many injuries from falls.

Across the road from the factory was a police station. At the sound of thunder, the stationed police suddenly saw a flash of fire on the second floor and heard screams. Knowing that a fire had occurred, they urgently reported to the Shanghai North District Fire Brigade and the Fire Department. Within a few minutes, the Shanghai North Fire Brigade dispatched eight fire trucks and one ambulance, and the Fire Department headquarters dispatched four pump trucks, two ladder trucks, and three ambulances. After arriving at the scene, they used water to extinguish the fire and sent the male and female workers who jumped from the building to the Municipal Fourth Hospital, Municipal Fifth Hospital, and Gongji Hospital for emergency treatment. The fire was completely extinguished at 4:55 PM. Except for the sewing tables and most of the underwear raw materials on the second floor being destroyed, the bottom floor and the third and fourth floors did not suffer much damage, and the loss to the fifth-floor dormitory was also very slight.

After investigation, it was found that 46 people were killed on the spot by the lightning strike and electrocution, 10 people died after being injured and sent to the hospital, 10 people were hospitalized for treatment, and 24 people were discharged after being bandaged, for a total of 90 casualties. The factory owner, Cai Hongsheng, and five of his family members were also burned when they fled in panic when the fire broke out and are now residing in the Municipal Fifth Hospital.

Fortunately, It Didn't Reach the Bottom Floor

According to Zhou Mingyang, a male worker who narrowly escaped from the factory, he was working in the flat car room on the third floor when the fire broke out. In panic, he jumped out of the window with the crowd. He only suffered minor head injuries when he fell to the ground. He said that there were a total of 104 workers in the factory, including 11 female workers. The factory owner and his family lived in the factory. Fortunately, the rescue was swift, and the fire did not spread to the pulping room on the bottom floor, because it stored raw materials for making scientific soft collars, such as celluloid, acetone, and more. If an explosion had occurred, the consequences would have been even more unimaginable, and he was still frightened as he spoke.

### Names of the Dead and Injured

The injured, in addition to the factory owner Cai Hongsheng, his wife Dai, and Dai's sister-in-law and four others, include the following male workers: Xie Genyao, Hu Hao, Yu Cunhua, Yang Shangda, Du Songnian, Zai Changlin, Wu Zuozhang, Chen Guotai, Dai Gengsheng, Wang Ruixiang, Ma Gongqing, Gao Ruliang, Cao Xikang, Xie Zukang, Shen Shengzheng, Tang Zhilin, Wang Naiming, Zhang Fulin, Chen Yonglin, Fu Anan, Pan Yongfa, Liu Wenlin, Mao Qian, and Pan Yuntai; and female workers: Wu Aixiang, Zai Shixian, Sun Aibao, Liu Guiying, and Chen Gongfen, totaling 34 people. The bodies of the 56 dead were sent to the Changde Road morgue for examination yesterday. The names of those who have been identified include: Li Jingen, Liu Jinyan, Gao Yugu (female), Dai Longshi (the factory owner's mother-in-law), Shen Guofu, Yu Youfu, Zhang Ruilin, and Chen Qinxin, totaling 18 people.

### Launching a Fundraising Campaign for Aid to China's Reconstruction and Revival

Kong Xiangxi, a member of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, previously donated all the shares of the China Construction Bank to the party and also donated a portion of his ancestral property to the country. Recently, he joined former Philippine Governor-General Paul Vories McNutt and Life magazine publisher Henry Luce to launch a fundraising campaign for aid to China's reconstruction and revival. The method is similar to the "One Bowl of Rice Movement" during the Anti-Japanese War, with a general association in New York; there are branches in San Francisco and Washington, D.C. High-ranking US government officials and important figures from the Republican Party have automatically joined as committee members.

### Trial of Yasuji Okamura to be Scheduled Within a Day or Two

General Yasuji Okamura, former commander-in-chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China, has been indicted by the prosecutor of the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense on charges of war crimes. Yesterday, according to the president of the court, Shi Meiyu, the date of Okamura's public trial will be decided within a day or two. The Military Tribunal is scheduled to conclude by the end of September, and the public trial of this case will be one of the most spectacular scenes before the court's conclusion.

### Two China Airlines Planes Complete Mission to Fly Medicines to Kaifeng

After the recent battle of Kaifeng, there were many military and civilian casualties, and there was an urgent need for relief medicines. The Henan Provincial Government recently received a batch of urgently needed medicines from the Ministry of Health. Due to the urgency of time, they requested that China Airlines dispatch two aircraft to fly from Shanghai to Kaifeng. China Airlines has no radio station or air station in Kaifeng, and July 7 was also a day of heavy rain in central Henan. However, in view of the urgency of the batch of medicines for relief, it was finally decided to dispatch two aircraft to fly to transport them. They arrived safely the day before yesterday afternoon, completed the mission, and flew back to Shanghai late the day before yesterday.

### Father's Day Fundraising Reaches Target; People Eagerly Contribute, Raising 10 Billion for Student Aid

Yesterday was the fourth Father's Day. The Shanghai Father's Day Promotion Committee held a simple commemorative ceremony at 10:00 AM at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station, inviting famous opera singers and celebrities to participate in the broadcast to launch a fundraising campaign for scholarships for needy students. More than 100 people from all walks of life attended. Speaker Pan delivered a speech, stating that commemorating Father's Day is to promote filial piety. During this time of Communist rebellion, we should especially be loyal to the country and save the national crisis. Li Ximou and Tan Yimin then gave speeches one after another. A children's singing broadcast then began, with more than 50 singers from the Six District Center, the Eleven District Center, Fuchun, the Women's Normal School Attached Elementary School, and Zhaofeng Elementary School participating. In the afternoon, famous opera singers and celebrities such as Mei Lanfang broadcast songs, which lasted until 2:00 AM this morning. The scholarship target was 10 billion. Party and state elder Wu Zhihui first donated 1 million yuan to promote it. In addition, Pan Gongzhan donated 20 million yuan, and elementary school student Pan Yinbao donated 10 million yuan from candy money. People from all walks of life generously donated enthusiastically. As of 1:30 AM this morning, the total amount had reached 8 billion. It is expected that by 2:00 AM, the 10 billion target will be reached.

### Buying Up Strong Laborers to Send to Communist Areas; Several Young Men Escape and Return to Shanghai

Authorities Reportedly Detain Several Key Suspects

The Shanghai Customs authorities recently received a tip that the Communists have secretly established an organization in the city to buy up strong laborers, paying between 60 million and 100 million yuan per person. After being bought up, these laborers are concentrated in groups of more than 10 people each time and secretly sent to the Communist areas in northern Jiangsu for strict training before being assigned to work on the front lines. Their targets for buying up in Shanghai are three: 1. Refugees, 2. Students, 3. Impoverished workers. All must be young. The method of buying up is to lure them in the name of joining the national army, tricking them into receiving money. Many young men have been deceived. After arriving at the location, several people discovered that it was not the national army and escaped back to Shanghai, reporting to the relevant authorities in the city. The authorities are now investigating based on the clues. It is reported that several key suspects have been detained and are being interrogated.

### Forging Export Certificates for Fraud: The Truth Comes to Light; Two Section Chiefs of the Ministry of Food Flee; Xia Shuhui Detained for Interrogation; Doctor Tao Youxin Also Arrested

The case of forged food export certificates discovered by the Shanghai Jianghai Customs has been fully solved. The three suspects, Ge Chengqi, Sun Zhongyi, and Ding Xingwu, have been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation. Zhou Yuyong and Wang Keqiang, the main culprits of forging export licenses in Nanjing, section chiefs of the Control Department of the Ministry of Food and the Land Tax Department, respectively, have fled upon hearing the news and are currently being pursued by the Criminal Police Team of the Capital Police Department. Two other main culprits, Tao Youxin, a doctor at the Zhonghua Clinic, and Xia Shuhui, a section chief of the Control Department of the Ministry of Food, have been arrested by the Criminal Police Team of the Capital Police Department. After an overnight interrogation, it was learned that a wide range of people were involved and that it was an organized corruption case. The Criminal Police Team is still investigating based on the confessions. The following is an exploration of the process of solving the case: Ma Jianqi (Shandong native), a Yantai grain merchant residing at No. 15 Sijing Road in the city, applied to the Yantai Municipal Government some months ago and was granted an import permit for 5,000 bags. At the same time, Ge Chengqi (Shandong native), a merchant residing at No. 461 Huayuan Hotel in the city, also applied to the Qingdao Municipal Government for permission to import 40,000 bags of flour. After approval by the Qingdao Municipal Government, an import permit for flour was issued, but the amount was reduced to 12,000 bags. The two then

jointly entrusted a person named Sun Zhongyi to approach the Ministry of Food in Nanjing for export certificates. Sun then entrusted a grain merchant named Song Guanjun, who introduced Tao Youxin, a doctor at the Zhonghua Clinic at No. 60 Tongren Street in Nanjing. Tao then agreed to help find a way. Tao has an elder brother named Tao Youzhi, who runs the Fuxing Oil Shop at No. 98 Shanxi Road. Tao Youzhi often went to the Ministry of Food to purchase oil for public servants, so he was very familiar with two officials in the Ministry of Food. He then took the flour import permits applied for by Ma and Ge in Qingdao and Yantai to contact people in the Ministry of Food. On July 25, Tao telegraphed Ma and Ge in Shanghai, saying that the export permits had been processed and urged them

to come to Beijing to collect them. The two returned to Beijing from Shanghai on the 29th and obtained two export permits. The permit for flour issued to Yantai was for delivery to Yantai Xintai Firm. The officials from the Ministry of Food who came forward to negotiate were Zhou Yuyong and Xia Shuhui, section chiefs of the Control Department, and Wang Keqiang, a section chief of the Land Tax Department. It was stated that the handling fee (i.e., the fee for processing the export certificate) was 500,000 yuan per bag, and the handling fee for the two batches of 17,000 bags totaled 8.5 billion yuan. Ma and Ge paid 10 taels, 3 mace, 1 fen, and 5 li of gold. Wang and Zhou issued a sample paper, which read: "Borrowed from Mr. Tao Youxin 10 taels, 3 mace, 1 fen, and 5 li of gold. The remaining balance will be paid after the Ministry of Food notifies the telegraph to Shanghai." Signed Wang Keqiang and Zhou Yuyong, with the date of July 25 of this year. After Ma and Ge obtained the export permits, they

took them back to Shanghai. At 2:00 PM on the 4th of this month, Ding Xingwu of the Yongfengli Customs Brokerage accompanied Ge to the Jianghai Customs to process the flour export procedures. The Customs Anti-Smuggling Section discovered that the Customs had not received a telegraphic notice from the Ministry of Food for the two certificates. After further review, it was found that the seal of the Ministry of Food that was printed was smaller than the original, the handwriting was slightly different, and one character in the seal of the person who sealed the certificate did not match the original.

They were immediately considered counterfeit. The Customs then selected ports to detain Ge and Ding and added interrogation. Ge confessed the circumstances of obtaining the export permits, but did not know whether they were forged. After the Customs received the confession, they immediately arrested Sun Zhongyi in Shanghai and immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Food to investigate the truth. After Ma learned of this, he also rushed to Nanjing overnight to accuse Zhou Yuyong, Xia Shuhui, and Wang Keqiang, section chiefs of the Ministry of Food, of fraud and embezzlement to the Criminal Police Second Detachment. After receiving the report, the police dispatched Song Guanjun and Tao Youxin, the introducers, to the team for questioning. After learning the truth, on the afternoon of the 6th, the squad leader of the Criminal Police Second Detachment visited Liu Xingji of the Control Department of the Ministry of Food. After Director Liu investigated and found that the two export certificates

were forged, Zhou Yuyong, a section chief of the Control Department who was involved in the case, had taken leave and left Beijing a few days ago. Wang Keqiang, a section chief of the Land Tax Department, also left Beijing privately on the morning of the 5th, and his whereabouts are unknown. Xia Shuhui, a section chief of the Control Department, was still working in the department. The police then sent personnel to arrest Xia. However, because the case involved many people, Nanjing has paid close attention to it. The Capital Criminal Police Team has transferred a large number of officers to investigate.

### Armed Fight Between Old and New Dock Workers; More Than Ten People Injured, One Drowned

[Report from Our Newspaper] In the Huangpu River in Nanshi Guan Bridge, yesterday at around 6:00 AM, a batch of old dock workers from the Yongxinji Transportation Company resumed their work. At around 7:00 PM, these more than 50 workers were resting on the Da Shanghai ship between buoys 8 and 9. Unexpectedly, more than 10 boats suddenly arrived, carrying more than 200 new workers, all holding wooden sticks and tree branches. They rushed onto the ship and engaged in an armed fight with the old workers. The injured on both sides included Chen Yong, Xiao Liansheng, and Han Hongxiao, totaling more than 10 people. One person slipped and drowned in the river. After the Maritime Police Bureau was notified, they ordered a large number of police officers to rush to the scene and arrested several suspects. The injured were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment.

### Establishment of the Social Welfare Construction Association; Actively Promoting Nine Major Goals

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Social Welfare Construction Association, after several months of preparation, held its inaugural meeting yesterday afternoon at the Wuxi Association Hall. More than 100 members attended, including Li Jiying, Ling Yingzhen, Pan Yingchun, and Wang Sheng, including people from industry, commerce, military, politics, and culture. The association aims to promote the spirit of mutual assistance among members and promote social welfare, and has formulated nine major tasks: (1) To improve national morality and reform social customs. (2) To develop social culture and instill popular wisdom. (3) To run various public welfare and charitable undertakings. (4) To advocate cooperative undertakings and establish public welfare facilities. (5) To promote national sports and promote the New Life Movement. (6) Various social services and vocational guidance. (7) To run industries and develop the national economy. (8) To assist the government in publicizing government orders and promoting local autonomy. (9) To run other social welfare undertakings.

### 42 Female Police Officers Are Brave and Do Not Yield to Men; Work Efficiency is Close to Ideal; Enough to Raise the Spirits of Urban Women

[Report from Our Newspaper] Among the urban working women recently, the 42 female police officers of the Municipal Police Bureau are quite eye-catching. They have all received education above the high school and vocational school level, and their average age is between 20 and 25 years old. There are more from Zhejiang. Last year, they were openly recruited by the police bureau. Due to the high standards, only 42 people were finally admitted. After training at the police training center, they officially graduated at the military parade held by the Zhongzheng Middle Road Police Bureau in January of this year and began their duties.

These 42 female police officers are all physically fit and beautiful. For example, Miss Yin Peizheng once represented the police team in the sword dance performance at this year's National Games. Her rotations were like flying, and the wind rose suddenly, earning a lot of praise. Misses Jiang Jianqun and Tang Suzhen are even taller and slender. They served as flag bearers in the New Year's Day military parade, and their brave appearance was enough to raise the spirits of urban women. In addition, there is also Miss Ye Ying, who is known as the "Flower of Female Police Officers." She is smart and lively, so she is assigned to work in the Public Relations Section.

Their only characteristic is that they can develop their various skills evenly, and with their courage and attention to detail, their efficiency in both internal and external work is close to ideal. For example, in the Records Section of the Criminal Investigation Section of the Criminal Department, they are able to cope with ease in the work of inspecting fingerprints, analyzing psychology, and investigating criminals. They also make great contributions in other areas, such as participating in special business inspections and compiling household registration cards. In particular, the female police officers who participated in the work of the Economic Police Brigade, such as Miss Zhu Dayu, once disguised themselves as customers and recently cracked many large-scale black market gold banknote cases, making outstanding contributions.

Currently, these female police officers all live in the western dormitory of the police bureau. They have freedom in their lives and are not strictly managed. They believe that the current service environment is not much different from when they were in school.

The picture above shows the leisure of a group of female police officers during their rest time.

### Fundraising for Special Relief Donations: First Step Fails, Mayor to Take Second Step, Personally Calling on the Doors of the Wealthy; If Still Ignored, Names Will Be Publicized

Regarding the special relief donation in this city, despite repeated solicitations by the municipal authorities and much persuasion, the response from contributors has not been enthusiastic. According to recent information obtained by our reporter, after several meetings to discuss the fundraising efforts, the Special Donation Fundraising Committee originally decided on three steps. First, the Mayor would invite wealthy individuals in his private capacity, asking them to make on-the-spot pledges for a certain amount (the pledge amounts were pre-determined by the Fundraising Committee). Second, if the first step failed, Mayor Wu would personally call on the doors of wealthy individuals, requesting donations in person. Third, if the door-to-door solicitations proved ineffective, the names of the wealthy individuals would be publicized, followed by a renewed request for donations, and those with evidence of having aided the enemy during the period of enemy occupation would have their misdeeds publicized. Currently, regarding the above three measures, the first step, involving the Mayor's invitation, has already been carried out, but many of those invited did not attend, so the first step has clearly failed, and the second step will be implemented within the next few days.

### Asleep and Brutally Attacked, Blood Splatters the Bed: Wife of National Assembly Representative Wang Guanying in Critical Condition; Assailant is Husband's Friend, Two Theories on the Motive

[Report from this newspaper] Min Binru (pictured), wife of Jiangxi National Assembly Representative Wang Guanying, was assassinated at her residence at 5:20 AM yesterday, leaving her in critical condition. The assailant, Li Zongguang, was apprehended on the spot. Afterwards, according to her family, the motive for the murder was purely for financial gain. However, according to the assailant Li Zongguang's statement at the police station, the situation is much more complex, claiming that Wang's wife was unable to distinguish between kindness and resentment and was intolerable in her ridicule and sarcasm, thus he acted out of anger.

Li is 38 years old, from Hubei. He and Wang Guanying were originally close friends and had frequent interactions in Chongqing before the victory. Last year, due to the failure of his alcohol factory, he became financially distressed and travelled to Shanghai, lodging with Wang and frequently seeking his assistance. Yesterday, he was refused a request for funds by Wang's wife, and considering the effort he had put into Wang Guanying's National Assembly campaign in the past, and the cold treatment he now received, he harbored vicious intentions.

Wang's wife, Min Binru, is from Wuxian, Jiangsu, and is 42 years old. She studied in the United States and obtained a Master's degree in Education from Harvard University. During the War of Resistance, she served as a professor at various universities in Chongqing, director of the girls' department of Southwest Middle School, and president of the Jiangxi branch of the Comforting Association. She came to Shanghai after the victory and resided at No. 5 Zhonghe New Village, Xinda Road. Li Zongguang had been lodging with Wang for half a year, during which time, unfortunately, a rift developed in their friendship. Yesterday morning at 4 AM, Min returned from outside and had just fallen asleep when Li Zongguang took the opportunity to sneak into the bedroom and struck her head with a hammer. She was severely injured in the back of the head, left eye, etc., and blood splattered all over the bed. In extreme pain, she cried out, which was heard by her older sister, Min Jianru, who was the first to enter and hold the assailant. Subsequently, the family rushed to report to the police, and the assailant was apprehended.

At the time of the incident, Wang Guanying was in Nanjing. After receiving the news at 7 AM yesterday, he took a flight back to Shanghai in the afternoon. The case is currently under investigation by the Xincheng Police Station. The victim, Min Binru, was sent to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment. It is reported that her injuries are serious, and she remains in critical condition.

### Communist Bandits Use Power Plant Sabotage Case to Intimidate Various Labor Unions

Since the power company's treacherous elements Wang Xiaohe and Wu Guozhen sabotaged the power plant and were sentenced to death according to law, the treacherous party has attempted to exploit this opportunity to incite labor unrest. Recently, they have been sending anonymous letters to various labor unions, distorting the facts and deliberately threatening them. The envelopes even falsely claim to be from the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau.

### Son of Philippine President Refuses to Divulge Secrets; Only Says Purpose of Coming to Shanghai is to Negotiate Commercial and Industrial Business; Expresses Great Surprise at Many Phenomena in Shanghai

[Report from this newspaper] Osmanie, the son of the Philippine President, flew from Manila to Shanghai last Wednesday. Our reporter recently visited him at the International Hotel. Osmanie is young, tall, and energetic, with a light and humorous tone. According to the business card he presented, his title is only listed as "Commercial and Industrial Business Consultant." He said: He has worked in the Philippine financial sector for more than ten years and has close ties with the commercial, industrial, and financial sectors in the Philippines. Therefore, his recent professional focus has been on commercial and industrial business consulting. Whether it is domestic or foreign individuals who intend to invest in various commercial and industrial enterprises in the Philippines, he is willing to serve them wholeheartedly, providing design and planning to ensure that the invested enterprises can grow and prosper. His mission here is also to conduct business negotiations with people in this city. When asked by the reporter what matters and with whom he was negotiating, he smiled and replied, "This is a matter of commercial confidentiality, and I am afraid I cannot disclose it for the time being."

He said: China and the Philippines have close ties in terms of ethnicity, economy, and politics. Therefore, cooperation should be strived for in all aspects. He expressed incomprehension about the current large-scale flight of Chinese capital to Hong Kong. He reported that the Philippines currently has many promising industries, including the textile industry, paper industry, plywood industry, and mining (metal mining) industry, all of which are waiting to be developed with great potential and profits, and he urged people from all walks of life to invest more to enhance the economic exchanges between the Philippines and foreign countries.

Revisiting Old Haunts After a Decade

This is Osmanie's first visit to Shanghai since the Pacific War. He stated: Before the war, he often took advantage of his holidays to travel to Shanghai irregularly. Having been away from Shanghai for a decade, he believes that the appearance of Shanghai is still the same as before, as if it has not suffered the devastation of war. The streets are even cleaner than before. However, the drastic changes in the internal substance of Shanghai are quite shocking to him. Among these, the inflation of currency is particularly acute and rapid. In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, the appearance has been severely damaged, the buildings are fragmented, and the streets are messy, which cannot be compared with Shanghai. Fortunately, the internal substance is still good, and the economic and financial situation is relatively stable, but the cost of living has obviously increased significantly compared with before the war. The salaried class with average income is more affected, but the labor class, who sell their labor every day, can earn an average of US$5 per person, and their living conditions are better than those of the teachers. Overseas Chinese have clearly occupied the retail market in the Philippines. He hopes that overseas Chinese can unite and serve the interests of the public.

Departing for the Philippines in a Few Days

He expressed surprise at the low price of rice in this city, as the price of rice in the Philippines is US$10 per stone. He stated: The Philippines does not prohibit the free trading of gold. The official price of gold is US$35 per ounce, but the market trading price often fluctuates around US$42. Except for the United States, the Philippines is not allowed to export gold to other countries. Finally, he inquired about the circulation of various newspapers in this city and told the reporter: The Manila Times has the widest circulation in Manila, with a daily circulation of 70,000 to 80,000 copies. Osmanie will stay in Shanghai for a few more days and plans to return to the Philippines within this week.

### Head of Western Food Department at YMCA Stabbed to Death; Assailant Leaves Behind a Large Knife; Found in the Deceased's Pants

[Report from this newspaper] Xu Lizhi, 52, from Yantai, Shandong, the manager of the Western food department at the YMCA on Sichuan Road, residing at No. 199 Wenlin Road, Hengshan Road, was returning home from work at around 9:50 PM last night when a thug suddenly rushed forward from the side of the road at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Hong Kong Road, stabbing him in the back with a large foreign knife. The tip of the knife pierced through his chest, and he immediately fell to the ground in pain. The assailant fled without a trace. At the same time, Xu's employee, surnamed Shao, was also returning home from work, passing by this place when he saw his boss lying in a pool of blood. He immediately called the police to the scene and urgently hired a car to rush him to the Public Concession Hospital for emergency treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died shortly after. After receiving the report, the Huangpu Police Station, under the order of Chief Feng of the Criminal Division, led by Section Chief Li and officers Ren Fengwu and others, rushed to the scene to investigate and summoned his eldest son, Xu Jingwu, to the station for questioning. According to the investigation, the large foreign knife used by the assailant was later found in the deceased's pants pocket, stained with blood. It was assumed that the assailant had stuffed it in afterwards and was taken back to the police station for safekeeping.

### Public Utilities Price Increase Issue: Public Utilities Bureau Answers Inquiries from Council Members

The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has prepared written responses to the various points raised by the councilors at the meeting of the Public Utilities Committee on August 6, as follows:

(1) It is true that the various companies suffered huge losses in July, so they directly reported to the Mayor for relief. The subsequent publications in the newspapers also stated the facts directly and cannot be compared to creating an atmosphere.

(2) The current price adjustments for electricity, telephone, and gas adopt a differential system, originally to take care of the burden on general small users, and this is being tried out in respect of the speaker's and the Mayor's wishes. If the Council has other decisions, it will be followed. This differential system is indeed beneficial for small users.

(3) Regarding the Public Utilities Investigation Committee's report on the Shanghai Electric Power Company's income and expenditure statement for March 1948, it should be noted that although the figures for "dividends," "interest," "depreciation," and "other" in the expenditure section of the statement are large, they are only accounting representations. The cash income and expenditure are actually loss-making rather than profitable, so the total income and expenditure are not balanced. The Bureau's calculation of prices does not follow the accounting expenditure, but is calculated according to a formula. The "other" item is not included, and only a small amount of "dividends," "interest," and "depreciation" are included.

(4) The calculation of the multiple of price increases should be based on the average price. Therefore, regarding telephone prices, if the price of 320,000 yuan for each call over 300 calls is used as the basis and it is considered to have increased by 10 million times, it may not be accurate. In fact, the high price is only charged after more than 300 calls have been made. Also, the fare for the former No. 2 tram from the Bund to Jing'an Temple was actually 6.5 cents in 25 years, not three copper coins. The fare for the No. 16 trolleybus was actually 10 cents, not five copper coins. Therefore, the claim that it has increased by 15 million times is not true.

(5) The base numbers in the price calculation formula are all negotiated in accordance with common practice and local actual conditions. For example, regarding public vehicles, the mileage per gallon of fuel in Shanghai is only about 6 kilometers due to the short traffic stops in the city and the many traffic lights in the bustling areas, but it has reached more than 7 kilometers in the suburbs.

(6) It is true that the salaries of foreign employees of foreign companies are converted using US dollars, but these employees had contracts with the company before the war, and they are now continuing to perform them. There are only 48 such people left, and the number is continuing to decrease. As for the other approximately 100 foreign employees who have not signed contracts, they are all paid according to the local cost of living index, which is the same as that of Chinese employees.

(7) In the past, the monthly price adjustments used the index number of the previous month, which resulted in huge losses for the company. Now, the index number of the current month is used. Before the index number is determined, it is tentatively estimated by adding 50% to the index number of the previous month.

(8) The reason why the current public transportation fares have a small difference in mileage is to reduce short-distance passengers in order to reduce congestion, maintain traffic order, and facilitate long-distance passengers.

(9) The continued recognition of the exclusive rights of foreign companies is based on the principle of equal new treaty agreements between China and the United States and China and the United Kingdom. However, since foreign companies are now subject to the management of the Chinese government, the policy adopted by the municipal government is to respect human agreements and enforce laws.

(10) Most of the repair work for the Shanghai Telephone Company's equipment is indeed contracted to the China Electric Company. This is because the company has supply contracts with the Electric Company for most telephone materials. However, the prices of new materials, such as when ordering from abroad, are restricted by international price comparisons and cannot be arbitrarily increased.

### Extorting Fees for Adding Household Registrations: Two Jia Leaders Sentenced to Imprisonment

[Report from this newspaper] There have been frequent reports recently of district Baojia leaders taking advantage of their positions to engage in corruption and bribery. Recently, Guo Yuanhe, the Jia leader of the Sixth Jia of the 47th Bao of Beizhan, and Yu Mingzhao, the Jia leader of the Seventh Jia of the same Bao, were both sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment by the criminal court of the district court for repeatedly taking advantage of their positions to fraudulently obtain property. The reason is that from December of last year to March of this year, when the households in the Jia added household registrations and applied for identity cards, Jia leader Guo Yuanhe successively extorted a total of 1.6 million yuan from Gao Yingxiang, Qian Renyi, Wang Hongbao, Zhang Qijia, Wang Baoyu, Chen Yuxi (Chen Lixi), Qian Heqing, Chen Guocai, Dai Qingfu, and others. Yu Mingzhao, the Jia leader of the Seventh Jia, also extorted a total of 740,000 yuan from Zhang Xueqing, Lu Hongsheng, Xue Yongsong, and others. The household registrations and identity cards of the various households were still left at the Jia leader's office and had not been issued. Later, Gao Yingxiang and others jointly filed a lawsuit, which was investigated and prosecuted by the prosecutor, and the sentence was made as above in accordance with the law.

### Gang Leader Song Xiangming Arrested

The city's Water Police Branch received a tip-off the day before yesterday that Song Xiangming, the leader of the "Six Shares Gang," was hiding in the Pudong anchorage, and the police station dispatched personnel to arrest him.

When the police station dispatched personnel to arrest them, Song led his gang to resist arrest. At that time, two of his gang members, Zhang Heshang and Zhu Dadanzi, were arrested, but Zhu escaped. According to the arrested Zhang Heshang and others, they were arrested and sentenced in 1946 for stealing cowhide at the dock. After serving their sentences and being released from prison, they resumed their old business. The theft of a large number of oil drums from the Petroleum Company and the theft of household rice were all committed by them. The police station has now escorted Zhang and Zhu to the court for interrogation. Song Xiangming, who was arrested the day before yesterday, is currently being detained for detailed interrogation.

### Air Tickets Difficult to Purchase, Scalpers Rampant, Black Market Exceeds Five Times the Price, Companies Strictly Crack Down, Assign Personnel to Verify Photos

The China and Central Airlines companies reduced the number of flights on various lines to reduce expenses due to the difficulty in purchasing gasoline and the difficulty in covering expenses. As a result, passengers traveling from far away to Shanghai or wanting to go to the mainland from Shanghai feel that the journey is far away, and airplane tickets have become a rare commodity. Scalpers have emerged, and the black market price of airplane tickets is more than five times higher than the original price. For example, the ticket price from Shanghai to Lanzhou is 340 million yuan, but the black market price is more than 1 billion yuan. Passengers are unable to purchase tickets and can only pay the price in pain. The authorities of the two companies have become aware of this and have recently stipulated that passengers must provide a personal photograph when purchasing tickets. Personnel are assigned to stand next to the plane and secretly verify the photographs upon boarding. If there is any discrepancy, boarding will be prohibited. At the same time, it is hoped that passengers will not be fooled by scalpers and will assist the company in cracking down on these unscrupulous people.

### Breaking the Case of the Jinan Organization that Aided the Communists and Smuggled Goods

—Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Li Tian

[Report from Jinan by air on the 5th of this month] Due to the unexpected success of the espionage work that led to the capture of Yanzhou on the 13th of last month—the primary reason being not the strength of the Communist bandits' fighting power but the infiltration of Communist spies into the National Army's various levels of units, including the confidential secretary of Commander Li Yutang also being a "Red Army," and even finding bombs under Commander Li's bedroom bed—this greatly heightened the alertness of the military and civilians here in this aspect, and at the same time strengthened their defenses.

Smuggling Electrical Machinery in Attempt to Exchange for Cotton and Millet

Under the multifaceted efforts of a certain unit, Jinan recently uncovered a smuggling organization of an unprecedented scale that aided the Communists with various materials (including military equipment). The time was at dawn on July 27th. Sun Maotang, the deputy manager of Yitaihe Freight Forwarding (who previously served as a staff sergeant in the Air Force ground service unit), hired a large cart from Xiao Youqing (who regularly transports goods between Jinan and the Communist-controlled areas in northern Shandong) with the assistance of his assistant, Sun Xueliang, at the west gate of Jingyi Weiwu Road in Jinan. In reality, what was loaded were four large crates of wireless radio equipment, five-kilowatt transmitters, eleven and a half horsepower generators, and other communications materials. On top, many crates of liquid manure were placed as camouflage. After Sun and his associates spent more than two months planning and over 17 billion yuan in "lubrication fees," the electrical machinery naturally passed smoothly through all the checkpoints and inspection stations. On the morning of the 27th, it was smoothly transported across the Yellow River to Tianshui Well. At this time, Sun and his associates felt as if a weight had been lifted from their hearts. They went from being happy to being proud, and from being proud to being carried away. They were convinced that this mission had been successfully accomplished and that the money was guaranteed. A set of electrical machinery and radio equipment worth only several hundred billion yuan can be exchanged for 100,000 catties of cotton and 200,000 catties of millet (according to Sun and others' confessions), worth over 2 trillion yuan. What is this if not "ten thousand profits for a single investment"?

Over a Hundred Armed Bandits Open Fire and Concentrate Their Shooting

Just as Sun and his associates were elated, personnel from a certain unit who had been following them, deciding that the matter could not be delayed, forced them to transport the cart back to the south bank of the Yellow River. At this time, Sun and his associates realized that their "success was about to fail," but due to the disparity in numbers, they had no choice but to transport the cart back onto the boat, and the boat set off from the shore to the south bank again. Before the boat had left the shore for five minutes, over a hundred "armed Red Army" members, who were responsible for receiving this batch of supplies, rushed to the Yellow River bank. Seeing the boat heading south, they concentrated their shooting in an attempt to force the boat to return to the north bank. At this time, the personnel from a certain unit on the boat, in addition to ordering the boatman to row harder to the south, also fired back. Another team of personnel from a certain unit, who had been ambushed in the sorghum fields on the bank, although small in number, were all crack shots who could "fire with both hands." Therefore, after a barrage of fire from both the bank and the center of the river, the bandits were unable to determine the strength of the unit and had no intention of fighting. In haste, they had no choice but to retreat north towards their base area. The unfortunate thing was that when the gunfire was intense, other civilian boats in the river, trying to escape, unfortunately collided with each other and sank one of them, with over twenty people buried in the bellies of fish. After the "people and loot" were brought to a certain unit, Sun and his associates naturally had no way to deny it. In Sun and his associates' confessions, it was learned that Li Xigui, the manager of Yitaihe Freight Forwarding, and the shareholder Yan Fenglai, were all "Red Army" members. However, they had already fled to Dezhou. Li was sent by the Industry and Commerce Bureau of Xiakou Town to Jinan City to specifically transport materials on behalf of the Communist bandits.

Detaining Over Twenty Key Suspects and Sealing Five Shops

What happened after Sun Maotang and his associates were detained was "no coincidence, no story." A certain gentleman, residing in the same courtyard as the Yitaihe Freight Forwarding, had long suspected that they were not good people, given the large number of people entering and exiting the freight forwarding company and the frequent appearance of plainclothes personnel carrying guns in the evenings. After hearing about a major smuggling case being intercepted by a certain unit, the freight forwarding company's personnel immediately fled. Only one person was sent to the freight forwarding company every day to check on the "situation." This gentleman happened to have a friend serving in a certain unit, so he reported it. On the 29th, in addition to detaining Wu Wangzhu (who previously served as a staff sergeant in the Air Force reception center), who was responsible for "keeping watch," Zhao Haibo, who was sent by the Communist-controlled areas to serve as a liaison, was also detained. In Wu and others' confessions, it was also learned that the electrical machinery was purchased from a certain military organization through Taichang Trading Company, which was responsible for the technical matters of repairing, loading, and transporting. At the same time, it was revealed that Lihuo Oil and Grain Store, Yihua Leather Shoe Store, and others, a total of five stores including the former one, were all in contact with the Communist bandits. As for how the goods were transported out, it was done through the relationships of Liu Wenyu (acting group leader of the Lu Province Government Investigation Office in Luokou), Zheng Lianyuan, Jiang Zhenlai, and others. How many billions A used, and how many billions B took, etc., were all revealed. Therefore, as a result of this case, over twenty people have been arrested, and up to five business establishments have been sealed.

Wang Yaowu Has Indicated That the Main Culprits Will Definitely Be Sentenced to Death

Since this unprecedented smuggling case of military communications equipment was solved, the people of Jinan were all delighted. The person in charge of a certain unit said to Commander Wang Yaowu: "Commander, you certainly know that bombs were found under the bed of Commander Li Yutang in Yanzhou. We are here to clear the bombs for Commander Wang. As for how to punish them, that is entirely up to the Commander." At that time, Commander Wang not only expressed his deep appreciation and commendation but also stated that the ringleaders would definitely be sentenced to death after a clear trial to serve as a warning. He also personally ordered Director Lu Dengke of the Adjutant's Office and Director Zhou Chuansheng of the Military Police Investigation Office to jointly handle the matter. Under the effective cooperation and strict deployment of Lu and Zhou, the key suspects in the case were largely apprehended.

### Wuxi Yunshang Silk Store Announces Liquidation of Illegally Transferred Inventory

[Report from Wuxi on the 5th of this month] The wave of business failures is unfolding in Wuxi. Yunshang Silk Store on Beiwai Tongyun Road once ran aground a few days ago. After finding a solution, it resumed business as usual. On the 5th, it suddenly closed down again, and an advertisement for a law firm was posted on the door, announcing the liquidation of assets, limiting all creditors to register within seven days. After learning of this, the creditors rushed to the store to negotiate, inspect the inventory, and discovered that there were instances of illegally transferring goods. They immediately took the matter to the East District Police Station for investigation.

### Outside the Pass, Continued (3) - Night in the Dunhuang Stone Chambers

— Our reporter, Song Lin

[Our newspaper, Lanzhou, 2nd dispatch] On the morning of July 17th, County Magistrate Zou of Dunhuang accompanied us to visit Crescent Moon Spring southeast of the city. The ox cart traveled very slowly on the sand for more than ten li, and the round trip took more than two hours. Crescent Moon Spring is located in the center of a group of pure sand hills. The highest one is called Singing Sand Mountain, which is more than 20 zhang high, about 50 li long, and about 20 li wide. If a dozen or twenty people slide down the mountainside in a team, the friction between the sand grains, plus the echoes from the surrounding sand mountains, will produce a loud buzzing sound. However, there were not many of us climbing the mountain, and we only browsed the summit. The water of Crescent Moon Spring is clear and emerald green, shaped like a crescent moon. Legend has it that Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty obtained a winged horse at Crescent Moon Spring, which could reach Anxi in one day and night. Now there is a stele of "Han Wowa Pond" beside the spring. There are six temples by the spring, all built by Taoism. Except for the Medicine King Temple, there is nothing worth seeing in the statues.

Thousand Buddha Caves – Development History

We returned to Dunhuang County in the afternoon for a short rest, and in the evening we took a car to the Thousand Buddha Caves. The Thousand Buddha Caves, also known as the Mogao Grottoes, are located at the foot of the Sanwei Mountain, 20 kilometers southeast of Dunhuang County. Snow water flowing from the Sanwei Mountain has cut through the sand mountains, forming a gully about two to three zhang wide. The bottom of the gully is flat with gravel. The east bank is about one to two zhang high, while the west bank varies from one to twenty zhang. The stone chambers are row upon row of caves on the cliffs of the west bank.

Regarding the development of the Dunhuang Stone Chambers, Secretary Chen of the county government, who accompanied us, said that the Shazhou Chronicles record that they were "created in the year of Gui Chou in the ninth year of Yonghe." The creation period of this cave should be in 353 AD. Local Taoists also talked about the motivation for building the caves: the sand mountain was cut off by the flood from the south, and there was still quicksand at the higher places on the west bank. When the sun set, because the sand was five-colored (but it looked like a mixed white color when we looked at it from the military camp), it was reflected by the sunlight and became ten thousand golden rays, which disappeared after sunset. In the first year of Taihe of Emperor Guang of Jin (366 AD), the monk Le Zun saw this wonder and thought it was the light of the Buddha. So he carved the first cave on the stone wall to sculpt the Buddha's image for worship. Later, Zen Master Fa Liang built another cave. During the Northern Wei Dynasty, several more caves were built. During the Tang Dynasty, Buddhism flourished, and there were more than a thousand cave rooms, hence the name Thousand Buddha Caves. According to common legends, during the Tang Dynasty, when the Western Regions were accessible, the Mogao Grottoes were a major road for travelers. Therefore, people who were sending off or saying goodbye prayed in the stone chambers to seek divine protection. Later, when they returned safely, they expanded the stone chambers, wrote scriptures, and offered Buddhas to repay the gods. This theory is more reasonable.

Ten Thousand Volumes of Tang Dynasty Sutras

There are several temples in the Thousand Buddha Caves, divided into Upper, Middle, and Lower Temples. We stayed overnight in the Lower Temple. Next to the temple is the Sutra Cave. During the Xixia Rebellion in the Song Dynasty, the monks of the Thousand Buddha Caves were about to flee to other places, so they sealed the scriptures, Buddha statues, and other items here. The cave is inside a passage and is extremely dark. We used the light of flashlights to inspect it. The cave is not large and can accommodate more than ten people. On the wall facing the entrance of the cave, there is also a Song Dynasty painting of ladies, which Zhang Daqian made a copy of.

The Taoist said about the discovery process: At the end of the Qing Dynasty, a Taoist priest from Hubei named Wang Yuanlu cleared the sand in the three-story cave with running water on May 25th of the lunar calendar in the 25th year of Guangxu. A crack appeared in the wall as the sand flowed out, as if there was light. He broke through the wall and found a double cave, which was suddenly bright and open. It contained ten thousand volumes of Tang Dynasty scriptures and countless antiques. Those who saw it were amazed as a spectacle, and those who heard about it spread it as a divine object. At that time, the magistrate of Dunhuang, Zai Zonghan, took some scriptures and portraits from Wang Taoist and transferred a part to Xue Tai Ye Changchi. Ye once suggested that these relics be transported to Lanzhou for preservation, but later ordered them to be sealed up due to lack of funds.

In the 33rd year of Guangxu, the Hungarian Stein purchased 3,000 complete long-scroll scriptures and 6,000 damaged ones, totaling 24 boxes, as well as 5 boxes of Buddhist paintings and embroidery from Wang Taoist and transported them to London. The following year, the Frenchman Bo Xihe bought more than 1,500 items from Wang Taoist with a large sum of money. Afterwards, although the government repeatedly ordered proper preservation, many were still bought by theft. When we came, we had no chance to see the Tang Dynasty scriptures again.

Research Institute Promotes Art

Now the Ministry of Education has established a Dunhuang Art Research Institute there to study and promote this treasure of Chinese Buddhist art. At the same time, a new exhibition hall has been built to display and compare the copied representative works, and new caves are constantly being excavated. There has been a lot of publicity about the research work on the Mogao Grottoes in China. Our one-night stay and four-hour tour here only gave us a concept: The caves will inevitably become the center of our country's art with the evolution of time, because its scope is too vast.

The director of the research institute, Mr. Chang Shuhong, went to Beijing on official business. Mr. Duan accompanied us on the visit. That day, we talked until midnight before resting. According to what he told us: There is also a Ten Thousand Buddha Gorge in Anxi (that is, Yulin Grottoes), and the works are more complete and systematic. In the past, because the local area was not peaceful, it was planned to conduct a long-term study there this winter. In addition, there are several caves west of Dunhuang County, but unfortunately many have been stolen.

The night in the Thousand Buddha Caves is the most unforgettable night of my life. Outside the window, everything is silent, the night is as cool as water, only the poplars are rustling, the moonlight is holding up the beehive-like stone treasure, the breeze is ringing the copper bells in the corner of the temple, and wild wolves are howling from the distance from time to time.

### Strange Well Discovered in Jinan

[Our newspaper, Jinan, 8th dispatch] A strange well has been discovered here where people and poultry die immediately after entering. In the Jinan Clothing Factory of the Joint Logistics Headquarters on Jingsan Road and Weishi Road in this city, there was originally a cave well dug during the enemy's time, which was usually used to store miscellaneous items. On the morning of the 6th, Zhang Yumin (24 years old), a worker in the factory, went to the well to store items, but did not come out for a long time. After being discovered, he died of illness. Another older worker was sent down to the well to rescue him, but the worker shouted for help after entering the well and was immediately pulled up, luckily avoiding death. The employees of the factory, seeing this scene, threw a live chicken into the well as an experiment, and it died immediately. It is reported that the factory has reported the incident to the court and requested an inspection.

### Robbing Wheat Boats, Plotting Money and Murdering - The Baitangwei Murder Case in Wuxi - Five Bandits Arrested, Mastermind Escapes

[Our newspaper, Wuxi, 7th dispatch] Zhu Xinbao and others from Jiangyin loaded wheat in Cheng on the 21st of last month to sell it in Wuxi. They encountered bandits in Baitangwei, which belongs to the county. Six people, including his associates Liu Aqi, Ren Yinfu, Wang Qinxia, Wang Jinsheng, and Zhu's wife Suying, were all tied up and drowned in the river. The wheat they were transporting was also robbed by the bandits. Several days later, the bodies were found in the original place, and the situation was extremely tragic. Because Suying was pregnant, the fetus flowed out from her lower body. After the local villagers salvaged the bodies ashore, they reported to the local court to send personnel to examine them, confirming that it was a case of plotting money and murder. After the case occurred, all parties were shocked. County Chief Zhou specially ordered his subordinates to solve the case within a time limit. By the end of last month, the Zhangcun District Office suddenly received information that gamblers in the Beixizhang area were highly suspected, so they joined the county government's intelligence office to arrest the suspects Sun Abing, Sun Axi, Zhao Xiaogou, Xu Fulin, and Sun Shungen at their addresses and presented them to the county government for interrogation. During the first court session on the 2nd of this month, the military law office, the criminals confessed to participating in the murder and robbery. According to Zhao Xiaogou's confession: "The idea of ​​robbery was initiated by Liu Zhenhe and other four people. There were seven people who went to do it that day. Two short guns belonged to Liu Zhenhe, and two long guns belonged to Sun Abing. The small boat belonged to Sun Shungen and was rocked by Xu Fulin to the mouth of the Yangtang River. When a wheat boat was discovered, Liu Zhenhe first ordered it to dock, and then forced the six men and women on the wheat boat to go ashore, and then stamped the wheat into the small boat. Later, because they wanted cash and jewelry from them, they resisted desperately. Liu Zhenhe told us to do it, and we tied them up one by one. After searching for gold and cash, we threw them all into the river to drown." It was also said that Liu was sent by the New Fourth Army, so the case is now clear. On the 3rd, the county government sent personnel to the countryside to arrest You Baoxing. However, during the continued court session the day before yesterday, the criminals suddenly retracted their confessions, denying all the details of the initial court hearing. The bandit Xu Fulin even claimed that he had a nervous breakdown during the first court hearing, so he spoke nonsense and could not be trusted. However, the military law office believes that the truth of the case is already clear. Once the mastermind Liu Zhenhe is captured, a decision can be made. Yesterday, the police were sent again to Wujiang and asked the county police bureau to investigate and arrest the criminal Liu to bring him to justice.

### Travel Suicide - Lü Pinhua Takes Poison - Dies in Suzhou

The 12th express train that departed from Shanghai North Station on the morning of the 6th arrived at Suzhou Station at about 1:00 pm. A young passenger in his twenties got off the train with the crowd, staggering and pale. The ticket collector noticed something unusual and quickly sent him to the station clinic for treatment, but he died because he had taken too much poison. The Suzhou Station police found a diary next to the deceased, which revealed his name to be Lü Pinhua. He had no family members. Because of the harsh environment, he could not stand in society and was involved in a love affair. He asked not to publish the news of his death and requested cremation. The local prosecutor sent personnel to examine the body and found that the deceased was about twenty years old, had long hair, wore glasses, a gray Hong Kong shirt, blue suit pants, yellow socks, and yellow leather shoes. It was determined that he had committed suicide by taking poison, about the time he boarded the train in Shanghai. He was temporarily ordered to be taken care of by the local security guard, waiting for his family to claim the body.

### General Pan Carries a Big Gun - Takes Two Civilians - Goes Deep into the Countryside of Liaozhong - Our Reporter Zhao Zhan

[Our newspaper, Panyang, 4th dispatch] The reporter traveled south along the Liao River towards the depths of the "pocket". All the green countryside that I passed through and visited was 20 kilometers away from Niuzhuang. The green could not cover up the desolation. In many similar-looking villages, I could not see a ruddy face, a fat pig, or a laying hen. The countryside was silent and depressed. "A look of bitterness, half a pair of broken pants" best illustrates the poverty of the farmers' lives. I met several front-line generals in a farmer's house in Ciyutuo Village. Sitting under the grape trellis and in front of the hibiscus flowers eating watermelon was a different kind of taste. The officers and soldiers of all levels in the front-line troops have unwavering confidence, and their iron discipline has won the gratitude and support of the people.

The Car in the Mud

There is one impression that is most profound on the way back to the headquarters from the front. At dusk on July 24th, our group of four jeeps hurried back. The car in which the reporter and another colleague were sitting with General Pan Yukun was running in front, and the other cars fell behind. They drove across the Liao River pontoon bridge from two different ferry crossings, so they lost contact with each other. At the same time, the car wanted to take a shortcut, so it left the county road and drove into the country road. We asked a farmer to guide us, but he got lost after getting in the car. When the countryside was hidden in the darkness of the night, our car had driven into the mud, and the driver was powerless. We asked two young farmers from the nearest village to help. After an hour, the car was still unable to move forward in the mud. So a farmer volunteered to go to a larger village farther away to find people and horses to help. We sat in the wheat field waiting. At this time, the sky was shining with sparse stars on one side, and dark clouds were densely covered on the other side, with flashes of lightning from time to time. The wind blew the fragrance of the soil, blowing over the sorghum fields as if the sound of thousands of troops and horses was coming from a distance. General Pan was not anxious at all. He chatted with the young farmer. The topic he loved the most was that it took seven pieces of cloth to marry an old woman in the countryside. When the "Eighth Route Army" was there, because marriage also implemented a "rationing" system, the young women rushed to marry the person they liked, just like picking the sweetest peach. Now that the National Army is here, it takes seven pieces of cloth for a girl to get married again. He also bluntly told this officer who did not know the rank that the chickens in his village had been eaten by the "Eighth Route Army". The farmers in the Northeast are really cute. After a while, more than a dozen people came, pulled two horses, and with a shout, the car was pulled out of the mud. They waved goodbye to us happily. They were completely voluntary help, without any reluctance. The car moved forward for about five li and then fell into the mud again. This time we had to walk on foot. We walked into the first village with a garrison. The sentry did not believe that this general was a military commander because he was carrying a big gun, and we were two "civilians".

Relax the Scale of Cold Wind Limits

The situation of purchasing wheat in Liaozhong is very good, on the one hand due to the efforts of the local government and the assistance of the army, on the other hand, after the recovery, the bandit currency was abolished, and the people urgently needed banknotes to exchange for something. Selling wheat is the only way. The circulating currency in the countryside is the circulating coupon, and Guanjin is not yet popular. The four purchasing stations in Liaozhong purchase up to 60,000 catties every day. There are many difficulties, such as too few chips, and the people have to wait to get the money. There are too few scales, and the people have to wait to weigh. The government also feels that there are not enough people. The method of purchase is the "public ownership, public transportation, and public storage" system to facilitate the overall planning of military rations. The farmers hope for "private ownership, private transportation, and private storage." This problem has not been resolved. From the reporter's observation, the scale of transport restrictions should be relaxed. The government allows private transport of up to 100 catties and requires an application for a transport permit and other procedures, which is tantamount to self-blocking. There are a series of political, economic, and social issues waiting to be resolved in the newly recovered land and rural areas, which need to be resolved quickly.

Three Harms in Liaozhong Awaiting Elimination

The reporter visited many farmers and learned that there are three books in Liaozhong that urgently need to be eliminated: (1) is the roving troops that harass the local area, (2) is the intelligence personnel who do evil, and (3) is the Liao River flood, which is rampant every year. In Liaozhong County, less than half a month after the recovery, there are 15 units of roving troops, with more than 4,000 people. Their food and clothing are all taken from the people. A certain Zhu claimed to be a "regiment commander". After being disarmed, his ID card said: "A kick the bucket professional."

### General Commodity Prices - The Intermittent Period Has Passed, Prices Are Rising in a Straight Line Again

The general trend of commodity prices had an intermittent period of just over two weeks, ending last weekend. Last week, amidst widespread talk of loose monetary policy, coupled with the nationwide adjustment of transportation costs and Shanghai's public utility rates, and with a significant increase in freight rates, there was a possibility of triggering a tidal wave of commodity price increases. However, due to rumors that President Chiang Kai-shek convened a meeting with Premier Weng Wenhao and others at Mogan Mountain at the end of last month to discuss new economic reform plans and emergency measures to stabilize prices, the market then circulated rumors that the authorities would nationalize gold and freeze savings accounts. Although this was solemnly denied by Governor Yu Hongjun of the Central Bank, major players in the market were nervous and generally adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Subsequently, as the new economic plan was delayed in its announcement, since Friday, commodity prices in the market have again shown a tendency to rise in a straight line.

Last week, the wholesale price index was 5,177,864 times higher than pre-war levels, an increase of 9.220% compared to the previous week. Last week, monetary policy was loose, and the Central Bank's net outflow of funds was extremely large, with a net outflow of over 570 billion on Friday alone, setting an unprecedented record. According to analysis, this was due to: (1) the Central Bank's outflow was due to fewer banknotes flowing out, with payments and receipts concentrated in clearing; and (2) the outflow of funds for large orders. The black market interest rate fluctuated around five jiao. Last week, the market for foreign exchange certificates was very good, with repeated increases, rising from 5.2 million at the beginning of the week to over 7 million at the weekend. Adding the foreign exchange benchmark price, it was close to the black market rate. Gold ornaments, after resuming business, saw slight fluctuations last week, with a stable trend. Trading was higher at the beginning of the week, with 390 million bought and 430 million sold. Later, there was a slight decline, but from Friday, it rose back to the original level at the beginning of the week, and rose again at the weekend, with 420 million bought and 460 million sold.

The adjustment of new prices for nationwide transportation and Shanghai's public utilities last week was as follows:

First, transportation: (1) Passenger and freight rates on all shipping lines were adjusted from August 5, with an increase of 120%. (2) Passenger and freight rates on all railways nationwide were adjusted from 00:00 on August 6. Passenger fares were calculated at 900,000 times the pre-war standard of 1.5 fen per kilometer, and the current zone calculation method was abolished, with charges based on the actual mileage between stations. Freight rates were calculated at 2 million times the pre-war standard of 2 fen per kilometer per 10 kilograms, with the maximum amount approximately twice the current price. (3) China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation adjusted fares on all routes from August 5, an increase of 34% compared to the previous rates.

Second, Shanghai's public utilities adjusted their new prices. Water and electricity were calculated from August 1, and transportation from August 5. Comparing the new prices with those of last month, water increased by slightly less than three times, electricity by 1.2 to 3 times, gas by 1 to 2.6 times, telephone by 1.5 to 2.9 times, streetcars by an average of 2.3 times, buses by an average of 2.2 times, small trains by 1.8 times, and ferries by 2.4 times.

This time, the adjustment of new prices for Shanghai's public utilities was too high, which deeply stimulated the morale of the market and played a leading role in raising commodity prices. The Municipal Council has paid attention to this, and we feel that public utilities are closely related to the lives of all citizens, and everyone has the right to ask about them.

In terms of government measures, those related to stabilizing prices are approximately as follows:

First, President Chiang Kai-shek convened a meeting at Mogan Mountain at the end of July to discuss and formulate a new economic reform plan. According to reports, the content of the plan includes emergency measures to stabilize prices in the first step, reforming foreign exchange policies to absorb overseas remittances and encourage exports in the second step, and reforming the currency system in the final step. Regarding price stabilization, it is rumored that the plan will involve merging financial institutions nationwide, conducting a general registration of banks and firms nationwide, raising capital, and ordering those that do not meet the regulations to close or merge. Currently, there are over 6,000 financial institutions nationwide, and after the merger, only one-third will remain.

Second, the newly appointed Director of the Shanghai Financial Administration, Lin Chongyong, officially took office on the 2nd, stating: "The current financial situation has developed to an extremely abnormal state. The number of banks and firms is the highest in the world, and the malpractice is at its extreme. For example, the expenses of banks and firms even exceed their total deposits. If this continues, the harm will be unimaginable. If the banking law is not seriously implemented, it will endanger the entire country and society. There are also two ways to prevent this: (1) to distinguish between right and wrong, and (2) to distinguish between good and evil. Those with normal operations should be guaranteed, and those with poor operations should be eliminated." Judging from Lin's remarks, the government's trend of financial control will be strengthened in the future.

Third, according to the announcement of the US Aid Utilization Committee, as of July 31, the US aid materials that have been shipped to China include 42,674 long tons of rice, 8,929 long tons of flour, and 70,370 bales of cotton. It is also learned that the second batch of US aid cotton has also been approved by the US Economic Cooperation Administration. A total of US$33.7 million can be started immediately.

In addition, the Yarn Management Committee was previously ordered to abolish, and the various departments of the committee are rushing to complete the closure. From now on, merchants and factories will be free to purchase, transport, and sell domestic cotton, and will not be subject to any government control.

The commodity prices last week, due to the aforementioned reasons, were initially hesitant at the beginning and middle of the week due to the impending announcement of the new economic reform plan, but by the weekend, it seemed that they could no longer wait, and many rose to new highs. In terms of yarn and cloth, for example, 42-count Jianfeng rose from 2 billion at the beginning of the week to 2.42 billion at the weekend, 21-count Shuangma rose from 1.57 billion at the beginning of the week to 2 billion at the weekend, and Longtou fine cloth once broke the 70 million mark. Tianqiao silk rose from 2.22 billion at the beginning of the week to 2.77 billion at the weekend. The grain market, from Friday, was affected by the adjustment of transportation costs, with Shangbai rice rising to over 43 million, and oil and flour also following suit. It rose again at the weekend, with Baijing rice breaking the 50 million mark, all setting new prices. Other items such as daily necessities, chemicals, and metals also followed this trend, with prices setting new records after Friday. The Shanghai wholesale price index by usage is as follows:

The Shanghai wholesale price index by processing degree is as follows:

The Shanghai wholesale price index by country of production and sales is as follows:

### Currency and Finance

(1) Black Market Interest Rate

Last week, the money supply in the city was extremely loose, even excessive. The main reasons for this can be summarized as follows: (1) The market was slightly stagnant due to rampant rumors (such as the economic reform plan), and the national banks and bureaus were able to take the opportunity to absorb large amounts of foreign exchange certificates and flour, and other materials. Coupled with other expenditures, the net outflow of funds from the banks and bureaus was more than 14 trillion yuan in five days from Monday to Friday. It is estimated that by the weekend, the city's floating capital had exceeded 50 trillion yuan, so the loose monetary policy was inevitable. (2) Remittances from various places poured in, especially from Tianjin and Qingdao. It is said that the daily remittances cleared amounted to as much as 2 trillion yuan, and at least 500 billion yuan. (3) Both buyers and sellers in the market adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and the number of internal and external demand orders decreased significantly compared to before, resulting in an abundant supply of funds.

Although this situation of loose monetary policy is just one of the manifestations of malignant inflation, its severity is becoming more and more intensified. For example, the huge net outflow of funds from banks and bureaus, the rise in black market interest rates caused by high commodity prices, and the shrinking purchasing power of the people are all setting new records each time. The extreme looseness of monetary policy this time is clearly a prelude to another sharp rise in prices, which deserves our deep vigilance.

Last week, the black market interest rate was most commonly at five jiao and four fen, but before Wednesday, the highest reached above six jiao, even seven and a half jiao. After Thursday, due to the large outflows of funds from banks and bureaus and the loose monetary policy, the interest rate fell below five jiao, and on Friday, some were even offered at three jiao and nine fen. In addition, the interest rate on loans secured by goods also fell repeatedly over the week due to the shift from tight to loose monetary policy. For example, the interest rate on loans secured by cotton yarn plunged from 45 yuan on Monday to 15 yuan on Friday.

From Monday to Friday, the national banks and bureaus had a total net outflow of 142,687 billion yuan, an increase of six times or more than 118 trillion yuan compared to the previous week when the monetary policy was not so loose. It can be said that it set an unprecedented record for the net outflow of funds from banks and bureaus. What is even more serious is that the actual outflow of funds from banks and bureaus last week was actually more than this number. For example, on Tuesday, the banks and bureaus only allowed the use of transfer methods to offset bills of over 5,000 times the pre-war value. It can be seen that the above outflow figures were smaller than the actual outflow.

For commercial banks and firms, orders were generally abundant throughout the week, and funds became more and more abundant, making interbank lending difficult. The clearing results of banks and firms after number 60, from Monday to Friday, showed a total net inflow of 808.7 billion yuan, which included the 45,427 billion yuan outflow of the Taiwan Bank. Therefore, excluding this number, the actual net inflow of indirect clearing in five days reached 535,140 billion yuan, an increase of more than 680 billion yuan compared to the same period in the previous week. Such a huge increase in indirect clearing is also unprecedented, and the abundance of bank and firm funds is clearly evident.

As for foreign banks, from Monday to Friday last week, the total net inflow was 731,690 billion yuan, an increase of more than 400 billion yuan compared to the same period in the previous week. Without this huge inflow from foreign banks, it is conceivable that the looseness of monetary policy last week would have become a flood.

(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates

Last week, the domestic exchange rate fluctuated relatively smoothly. The Guangzhou exchange water was 350 yuan on Monday, increased to 400 yuan from Tuesday to Thursday, and then fell back to 300 yuan on Friday. The Xiamen exchange water was 500 yuan from Monday to Wednesday, fell to 400 yuan on Thursday, and then fell to 300 yuan on Friday. This may be a prelude to a change in demand, a decrease in the southern bandits, and a resurgence of rising prices. The Chongqing exchange water was 150 yuan before Thursday, and increased by 50 yuan to 200 yuan on Friday. The Wuhan exchange water was 180 yuan on Monday and Tuesday, increased to 200 yuan on Wednesday and Thursday, and then returned to 180 yuan on Friday. The Tianjin exchange rate remained flat throughout.

Last week, the foreign exchange market saw a sharp rise in the price of foreign exchange certificates due to rumors of a change in foreign exchange policy, a large number of import licenses being issued, and large-scale purchases by the authorities. For example, the asking price on Monday was 4.5 million, and it continued to rise to 6.4 million on Friday. Gold shops raised the listed price of gold ornaments to 430 million and 400 million yuan on Monday. On Tuesday, due to rumors of gold nationalization, it plummeted to 380 million and 340 million. Later, the rumors passed, and the price became firm again, returning to the high price of Monday on Friday. Last week, the Hong Kong Shanghai exchange was lengthened to eight fen in the first half of the week, but on Thursday, it began to shorten to seven fen Hong Kong dollars for 100,000 legal currency. Hong Kong US dollars were priced at 5 yuan, 4 jiao, and 6 fen. Gold fell to 329 yuan per tael on Wednesday, and rose again to a high level of 332 yuan and 5 jiao on Thursday.

(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets

At the beginning of the week, rumors were rife, and bulls and bears each had their own advantages. The stock market fluctuated abnormally. Yong Yarn opened and immediately rose to the limit of 13,860 yuan. Yongye, Lianhua, Zhongxing, Zhabei, Zhonghuo, Cement, and other seven stocks also followed suit and rose to the limit. Later, negative news was rampant, and it suddenly泻. At the close in the afternoon, the overall increase and decrease were slightly higher than the previous weekend, with little fluctuation. The next day, due to the news of the new economic reform plan becoming more specific, major players waited and watched. Yong Yarn once fell to the limit, but finally closed at 11,800 yuan. Except for Yongye and Lianhua, which stood at the limit, the remaining stocks fell by about half. On Wednesday, it still did not escape the fatigue and entered a consolidation phase. As a result, Yong Yarn rose by 230 yuan and closed at 12,030 yuan, and the remaining stocks saw mixed gains and losses. Although the money supply loosened on Thursday, the buying side was still wary because the Financial Management Bureau dispatched a large number of people to inspect the financial market. The rise of each stock was not significant, and Yong Yarn rose to 12,750 yuan at the close. The trading of other stocks was sluggish, and the price increased slightly. Starting on Friday, due to being trapped in a state of fatigue for a long time, the market moved from stillness to activity. The banks and gold businesses competed to buy, and the trend gradually rose. After several consolidations in the afternoon, the market was particularly strong before the close. Yong Yarn, Zhonghuo, Zhongyi, Lianhua, and Yongye all rose to the limit. All other stocks, except for Mei Lin, also rose by between half and one and a half percent. At the weekend, due to rumors of currency reform in the new economic reform plan, it was believed that stocks with a large increase would fall, while those with a small increase would rise. This created a situation of cold rises and hot 泻. Yong Yarn closed at 13,980 yuan, slightly lower than the previous day. Zhonghuo, Zhongsi, Cement, Zhabei, Yongan, Commerce, and other cold stocks all saw gains.

### From the Business Arena to the Battlefield

Recently, the authorities have shown signs of adopting a so-called "hands-off" attitude towards certain measures in the industrial and commercial sectors. In some cases, too much control can suffocate industry and commerce, but in other cases, letting go can cause immeasurable harm to the industrial and commercial sectors. For example, the fact that public utilities have risen by two or three times in the past week has undoubtedly increased the burden on industry and commerce. According to the direct reason for the increase in public utility prices, the main point is that the companies are suffering too much loss, and they cannot be supported without raising prices. However, the crux of the problem is clearly as Chairman Zeng of the Municipal Council said at the "anti-price increase" panel meeting: First, the central government has no solution for the overall economy, finance, and finance, so prices continue to rise, and public utilities are no exception. Local governments can only treat the head when it hurts and the feet when they hurt, so it is difficult to achieve stability. Second, the Municipal Council has repeatedly suggested to the central government that the foreign exchange required by public utilities be approved for settlement once every three months, and the fuel and coal required be allowed to be purchased once every three months, but the central government did not adopt it, which led to the serious situation today. Without asking whether the opposition to the increase in public utility prices by the more than sixty councilors this time will have a practical effect, one thing is obvious: the reason why public utility prices have repeatedly increased is the result of the authorities' "hands-off" approach, and the reason why the authorities do not adopt the so-called subsidy policy and are willing to let go, and are willing to be the target of public opinion, is because their cheap foreign exchange and their legal currency have long been used for other purposes!

However, it is not enough to save foreign exchange consumption only in public utilities related to people's livelihood. For example, the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee of the Central Bank also held its second meeting on Tuesday last week. It is said that the examination principle of the committee is still based on the government's policy of saving foreign exchange, and strict processing is carried out. Regarding the foreign exchange required for importers to import goods, it is still reviewed and determined by the Import and Export Management Committee. Not only that, the authorities have also spent a lot of effort considering the use of US aid materials that are about to arrive. According to reports, the government will suggest to the United States in this period that the currency recovered from the sale of aid to China materials should be used to balance the financial budget. According to Yan Jiaxin, a member of the US Aid Utilization Committee, part of the proceeds from the sale will be frozen. This "free trade" policy of investing US aid materials in the black market market, in addition to achieving the purpose of "partially freezing legal currency," obviously a considerable part will be used to raise foreign exchange funds. It can be seen that for military needs, the government will inevitably do everything possible to save or hunt for foreign exchange, so it is not surprising that public utility prices will repeatedly increase. Furthermore, this time the decision to export US aid cotton to make yarn and import US aid fertilizer to exchange for grain, although it is said that foreign cotton can be purchased after exporting cotton to make yarn, it will naturally earn more foreign exchange in a blink of an eye. As for whether the yarn price will rise sharply due to foreign transportation, the authorities seem to be unable to take care of it. Fertilizers can be converted into grain imports. In addition to "reducing the issuance of currency to promote grain production," it will naturally also directly help the war.

Regarding the partial opening of self-provided foreign exchange, it has also become a hot topic of discussion in the public opinion and industrial and commercial circles in the past week. The Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Industrial Association convened a symposium for people in the industrial sector on Tuesday last week. On Thursday afternoon, the Import and Export Association invited people from the industrial sector, scholars, and representatives of the Import and Export Management Committee to hold a similar symposium. We only need to refer to the opinions of Chen, Director of the Export Promotion Department of the Import and Export Management Committee in the meeting, and we can clearly see the painstaking efforts of the political diseases to promulgate this method. Chen believes that the funds of Chinese people abroad can be taken into account for investing in raw materials in the country. However, it seems unreasonable to turn raw materials into finished products, turn them into legal currency funds, and then go abroad to purchase raw materials. Obviously, after raw materials are turned into finished products, turned into legal currency, and then go abroad to purchase raw materials, the government cannot increase its foreign exchange income due to the return of overseas Chinese capital. Although this approach is beneficial to the industrial and commercial sectors and production, is this the government's biggest goal! The Secretary-General of the Import and Export Management Committee said more sharply: "The reason why this method is announced is straightforwardly to hope to import the equipment and raw materials lacking in the country without spending the country's foreign exchange... At the same time, we must pay more attention to how to give these factories a way out for the finished products they produce after they resume work, and not to obtain black market foreign exchange." Obviously, there are two things in the authorities' minds about the "way out for the finished products": First, for the government to purchase, and second, to sell the foreign exchange certificates obtained after the finished products are exported to the government. This is of course a calculation to enrich foreign exchange funds. In a word, modern warfare requires the consumption of huge amounts of foreign exchange!

It is said that a large part of the unprecedented outflow of funds from the national banks and bureaus in the past week was the price paid by the authorities for purchasing foreign exchange certificates and flour and other materials in large quantities. This can't help but remind people of the various rumors in the market over the past ten days and the whereabouts of the large banknotes issued. Whether the negative rumors have stabilized the market temporarily, and then batches of large banknotes are released and batches of materials are brought in, if it is unfortunate and so, I am afraid that another storm for the industrial and commercial sectors is not far away.

The business arena is not only like a "battlefield," but it is not difficult to see that the roads of the business arena are closely linked to the cruel battlefield!

### Prospects for the New Economic Reform Plan

— Cai Runlan

When we talk about the new economic reform plan, we can't help but think of the "old" economic reform plan that passed away not long ago. Since the restoration, the things that can be mentioned in this regard include the economic emergency measures during Premier Song Ziwen's time. As the name suggests, this was a relatively temporary measure, so let's not bother with it. Later, during Premier Zhang Qun's time, the National Economic Commission was established under the Executive Yuan, and it passed the economic reform plan in one go, with great ambitions to revitalize the country. The plan at that time included three major goals: finance, production and construction, and finance, involving the reorganization of national banks, the establishment of sound county banks, the construction of agriculture, industry, commerce, and transportation, the management of finance, and the stabilization of currency value, and was ultimately full of optimism. The conclusion stated: "In short, production undertakings cannot be without the nourishment of finance for a day, and financial income cannot be without the support of production undertakings for a day. Financial policy, economic policy, and fiscal policy are mutually cause and effect, and complement each other, and cannot be separated for a moment. As for what is stated in this plan, those that have been implemented by the government but have not yet shown results should be strengthened by the competent ministries and commissions: those that should be implemented immediately and prepared for implementation should be distributed by the Executive Yuan to the competent ministries and commissions to properly formulate detailed measures and implement them quickly. Secondly, there are three points that should be paid special attention to in order for this plan to be promoted smoothly:

(1) To reasonably solve the treatment of officers, soldiers, civil servants, and teachers, so that they can maintain the minimum necessary living conditions, so that administrative efficiency can be improved. (2) State-owned enterprises and private enterprises should be on an equal footing, and there should be no discrimination, and no private enterprise should be given special treatment, which would increase the difficulties of legitimate private undertakings. (3) In the social aspect, a broad economic construction movement should be launched to improve the public's understanding and interest in the economy, and to use the power of cooperation between officials and the people to overcome the difficulties of economic construction. If the above reform measures can be carried out in coordination, the current phenomena of production stagnation, soaring prices, depletion of tax sources, and imbalance of revenue and expenditure can be changed immediately. Then, there will be many who produce and few who consume, those who work will be diligent, and those who use will be generous, so wealth will always be sufficient, and the crisis of fiscal economy can be saved."

This reform plan was beautifully written, as for its achievements, there is no need to review them, the facts will speak for themselves.

Regarding the production side, what we heard was that there was a shortage of raw materials, excessive control, and production institutions were fleeing to Hong Kong one after another. Regarding prices, according to the wholesale price index compiled by the China General Chamber of Commerce, as of the first week of August this year, it was 5,177,864 times. Regarding tax sources and revenue and expenditure, Finance Minister Wang Yunwu publicly reported on June 16 that this year's May revenue was 15 trillion yuan, and expenditure was 75 trillion yuan, with revenue only one-fifth of expenditure. Now, even the National Economic Commission, the institution originally designed, has been explicitly abolished. Who will cash in this plan?

This time, Premier Weng Wenhao's new economic reform plan has only been heard of, but has not been seen. The details are not yet officially announced. However, according to a partial report, "The new economic reform plan drafted by the Weng Cabinet was discussed by President Chiang with relevant personnel at Mogan Mountain on the 30th and 31st of last month, and after making decisions on various issues in principle, the Executive Yuan will formulate implementation steps according to the new plan and announce them in stages according to their nature. According to official sources, the first step of the plan is to focus on emergency measures to stabilize prices, which will be first submitted to the political affairs meeting on the 4th for discussion. If approved, it can be announced and implemented on the 5th. The next step is to reform the foreign exchange policy, absorb overseas remittances, and encourage exports. The final step is to reform the monetary system. As for the timing of the implementation of other steps, it will be determined according to the effect of stabilizing prices and the actual environment at that time."

Now we come to criticize the new economic reform plan, because it has not yet been officially announced, it seems to lack a basis, but stabilizing prices, managing foreign exchange, and reforming the monetary system are indeed the main issues in the current economic problems. Let's talk about it for now.

Stabilizing prices is already an old topic. The key is whether the government's revenue and expenditure can be balanced? If there is an imbalance, what can be done to make up for it? Can the issuance of currency be frozen? On the issue of details, such as the treatment of civil servants and teachers, it should be improved in principle. The authorities have to set up institutions such as the Bandit Suppression Committee in order to cope with the government environment, which are difficult problems to solve.

Speaking of foreign exchange management, in order to attract overseas remittances, the government must at least pay the exchange rate of overseas remittances equal to the black market price of foreign exchange, but does this reflect the further devaluation of the legal currency? Stimulate prices to rise further? In addition, how can we create a good environment in the country to allow overseas remittances to continue to invest? Encouraging exports is not a simple issue either. Has the government made up its mind not to care about the foreign exchange of exporters and let them develop freely? The competition in overseas markets and the rise of Japan are already a serious problem that the authorities are reluctant to discuss. Furthermore, is foreign aid free? How should "reciprocity" be studied in trade?

Finally, there is the reform of the monetary system. We don't have much to say about this issue. Let's just say casually that changing 20 yuan of legal currency into one yuan of customs gold is not also a reform of the monetary system? Why bother to discuss it so much?

As the saying goes, "Reviewing the old and knowing the new," when we think of a series of question marks about the current economic problems and the achievements of Premier Zhang Qun's economic reform plan, are we optimistic or pessimistic, trusting or skeptical about the future of Premier Weng's new economic reform? Let's wait! Let's wait for Premier Weng's miracle to give us the answer.

### World Games Basketball Championship Schedule Completely Arranged China is Placed in the Third Division Today's First Game is Against Switzerland

[Our Newspaper] The most intense event of this year's World Games is the basketball competition, especially the five teams in the second group's round-robin tournament, whose wins and losses are uncertain and changes are complicated, presenting an unprecedented chaos. As a result, five teams ended up with the same record, each with three wins and two losses. The officials of the Chinese delegation did not understand the competition rules and were finally unfairly ranked fifth, which is a pity. The ranking finals have already begun on Saturday of last week and will continue today, and the rankings of all 23 countries will be determined. The rankings of each group and the schedule of the three divisions are listed below:

First Division Championship

Determining 1st to 8th place

Second Division Elimination Tournament

Determining 9th to 16th place

Third Division Elimination Tournament

Determining 17th to 23rd place

Rankings of Each Group

(Second Group) (1) Chile, (2) Korea, (3) Belgium, (4) Philippines, (5) China, (6) Iraq.

(Third Group) (1) United States, (2) Czechoslovakia, (3) Argentina, (4) Peru, (5) Egypt, (6) Switzerland.

(Fourth Group) (1) Mexico, (2) France, (3) Cuba, (4) Iran, (5) Ireland. Looking at the arranged order of each group, the first division championship will be contested by the strongest teams, Brazil and the United States. In the second division losers' bracket, the Philippines will play against Canada or Belgium to determine 9th place. In the third division, China and Egypt will compete for 17th place. However, in any case, the world knows that although China is placed in the third division, Korea in the first division and Belgium in the second division were both defeated by China, which is also a source of consolation. The basketball competition system is still not ideal and has many shortcomings, which is obvious. China's first game today will be against Switzerland.

Second Group Rankings

The mystery of the rankings in the second group has finally been revealed. China is actually ranked fifth. According to the announcement by the World Games authorities, it is based on the 14th World Games basketball competition rules established by the International Amateur Basketball Association. The calculation method of the average score of each team is limited to the record between the teams with the same accumulated points. The record against Iraq is not included. According to this calculation, the five strongest teams tied for first place in the second group should be calculated as follows:

### Japanese Swimming Star Furuhashi Breaks World Games Record

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, August 8] Japanese swimmer Hironoshin Furuhashi, after setting a new record in the 1,500 meters, set a record of 4 minutes and 40.4 seconds in the 400-meter freestyle preliminaries yesterday, which has attracted much attention in Japanese swimming competitions. This record has broken the current World Games record of 4 minutes and 41 seconds set by American swimmer Smith.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, August 8] Japanese swimming star Furuhashi will perform a swimming demonstration at 8:15 tonight, attempting to break the record of 4 minutes and 40 seconds set by American swimmer Smith in the 400-meter swimming competition at this year's World Games.

### Mrs. Cohen is the First Female Hero

[United Press London, July 7] After the American World Games team swept eight men's swimming events, they ranked first in the unofficial national overall scores for swimming, track and field, and field events. They have already won 10 gold medals in track and field alone. The total score reached as high as 457 points, which is unprecedented in the history of the World Games. However, in terms of personal glory, the first place goes to Mrs. Cohen of the Netherlands. In addition to winning the 100-meter, 200-meter, and 80-meter hurdles championships, she also helped the Netherlands win first place in the 400-meter relay with the last leg. Therefore, she won a total of four gold medals and became the first female hero in the history of the World Games. Her achievements are only comparable to those of the American black star Owens in 1936.

### Leading the Improvement of Secondary Education Rewarding Model Secondary Schools in Provinces and Cities The Ministry of Education Issues a Circular to Select and Report Candidates

### We Are Not Discouraged Did Not Lose Face in Front of Strong Enemies Shi Zhaokang Talks to Foreign Reporters

[Agence France-Presse, London, July 7] Shi Zhaokang, the secretary of the Chinese World Games delegation, told our reporter today: "Please tell our friends in Shanghai that the Chinese World Games team did not lose face in front of strong enemies. As for victory, we did not expect it beforehand." After smiling bitterly, Shi said, "After the wheels of sports in China turn, one day we will be able to win first place." Shi was not discouraged by the misfortune that the Chinese soccer team, track and field athletes, and the only swimming athlete were not selected. Qu explained: "The Chinese soccer team encountered one of the best teams in Europe. The swimming athlete was eliminated by a hair's breadth in one of the best groups in the preliminaries. Chen Yinglang was also eliminated by a few inches in the 400-meter preliminaries. In the 10,000-meter race, Lou Wenao ranked 17th out of 30 athletes from various countries. Ten of the thirty people failed to complete the race. If Chinese track and field can start training now, it should have brilliant results at the next World Games in 1952. The instability of the general situation in China and the inadequacy of sports facilities show that the results we have achieved in London are not bad. The Chinese basketball team's defeat of Belgium and Korea is a sign of future glory. Please tell the people of the country that we will never be discouraged and will continue to do our best to win glory for our country."

### Two Proverbs

— Ze Shi

I have sporadically read some foreign articles criticizing the Chinese people, and I feel that the criticism outweighs the praise. Among them, Bertrand Russell loved the Chinese the most. He once said something like this: Even if the civilizations of England and America are destroyed, as long as China exists, the world will still have civilization. However, Russell's high praise of China was criticized by Lu Xun, who believed it was intended to numb and was ill-intentioned. Lu Xun's observation of the Chinese people was profound, ranking among the best in the era, and his conclusion was pessimistic, if not desperate.

To study the Chinese people! Such a large and ancient nation, how dare I? However, we often hear and see two common proverbs. If these words are spoken for a reason, then one cannot help but sigh at the Chinese people. The two proverbs are:

When well-fed and warm, one thinks of lust; when hungry and cold, one contemplates theft.

Think about it, being human in this world is nothing more than being either well-fed and warm or hungry and cold. Now, if one is hungry and cold, one will contemplate theft, and if one is well-fed and warm, one will think of lust. Neither is good, so isn't this a great flaw? Even if China enjoys favorable weather, abundant harvests, or gold everywhere, easily picked up, and 390 million out of 400 million people are well-fed and warm, with only 10 million hungry and cold, the situation is not beautiful. This is because, although those who contemplate theft only account for an absolute minority, social order would inevitably be disrupted. Moreover, if lustful people are everywhere in the country, what would become of national morality? Wouldn't the issue of public morals be serious? Conversely, if there are more hungry and cold people and fewer well-fed and warm people, the situation would be even more unthinkable.

I hope that these two proverbs are just nonsense, or at least cannot be generalized. However, given the facts before us, these words are not spoken without reason, especially the first sentence. Since the national crisis, the number of people who have made fortunes is not small. Their being well-fed and warm is undoubtedly beyond question. However, have they contributed even a little to the nation and society? They haven't even done a bit of good deeds like providing tea or medicine to the needy. Why is that? Is it that the more well-fed and warm they become, the more lustful and sensual they become, spending their days rotating between being well-fed and lustful, oblivious to the existence of the country, society, the world, and humanity?

Moreover, if the first sentence of these two proverbs is close to the truth, then there is a danger that the second sentence will also be promoted and realized. Gold has never been everywhere in China. Well-fed and warm people only think of lust. After lust, they will inevitably think more about being well-fed and warm. Hunger and cold will then become widespread among the people, and the desire for theft will become rampant, eventually becoming like a prairie fire, unstoppable.

I worry about China's fate thinking about these two proverbs.

### Chrysanthemums in the Old Capital

— Yi Yun

Peiping is the birthplace of Peking Opera, and once gathered famous performers, reaching its peak. Now, times have changed, and it is not what it used to be. Here is a description of the situation in recent months.

Theaters: Before the Anti-Japanese War, Peking Opera theaters were spread throughout the southern, eastern, and western parts of the city. There were only a few cinemas, such as Ping An and Zhen Guang. Now, there are more cinemas than Peking Opera theaters. Zhonghe, Qingle, Xin Xin, and other theaters have all been converted to showing movies. Jixiang Garden and Guangde Lou have also been converted to Ping Opera. The only theaters that still perform Peking Opera are Chang An, Hua Le, Municipal (formerly Kai Ming), San Qing, and Hua Bei. Among them, Hua Bei only performs for training classes, and major performers do not perform there. Among these few theaters, Chang An Theater has a suitable location (on West Chang An Avenue), beautiful architecture, and a spacious venue. Many famous performers take turns performing there, but Tan Fuying performs at Hua Le and San Qing theaters.

Troupes: Although ticket sales are not good, there are more troupes instead. They include: (1) Shang Xiaoyun and Xiao Cuihua; (2) Xun Huisheng; (3) Tan Fuying; (4) Li Shaochun; (5) Ye Sheng Lan; (6) Ye Shengzhang; (7) Qiu Shengrong; (8) Yang Baosen; (9) Zhang Junqiu, Ye Shengxi; and Chu Shilai. There are also three female troupes: Xu Dongming (Laosheng), Wu Sifeng (Huadan), and Liang Suiming (Laosheng). In addition, there are also temporary troupes that cannot be listed. Ye Sheng Lan with Xiaosheng, Ye Shengzhang with Wusheng, and Qiu Shengrong with Hualian, each formed a troupe, performed main acts, and became headliners, creating a new situation, which was rare in the past.

Ticket Sales of Shang Xiaoyun: Shang Xiaoyun and Xiao Cuihua have a good reputation in Peiping. Now, they have collaborated to form a troupe, which is enough to attract audiences. Ticket sales are still not bad, but ticket prices are very low. Recently, the best seats only cost 800,000 (in mid-July, only 600,000) per person, which is less than two jiao compared to the pre-war value. The rest range from 500,000 to 600,000. It is considered good if ticket sales are more than 50% of capacity. It is no longer possible to see people rushing to buy tickets and filling the theater. This has led to the following situations: (1) In the past, it was impossible to get good seats without regularly giving favors and tips to the ushers. Now, anyone can get them by giving the ticket seller an extra 100,000 to 150,000. (2) The main performers know that it is difficult to sell out the theater, so they ask people to sell tickets in advance, calling them "red tickets." These red tickets, if priced at 500,000, are secretly sold for only 300,000. If they can sell them for more than 300,000, then the excess is the commission for the seller. A new practice of bargaining has gradually developed between ticket buyers and sellers. (3) There are also tickets that cannot be sold, such as complimentary tickets for military and police agencies, seats for veterans, and the front-of-house tea room, which invite customers to fill unsold seats after the main act starts, charging a tea fee and a small tip as their allowance.

Supporting Roles: All troupes lack good supporting roles. Shang Xiaoyun's troupe does not have a second-tier Laosheng. Tan Fuying's troupe does not have a good Huashan. This diminishes the appeal of many good plays. Some good plays require a large number of supporting roles, making it impossible to perform them. Only a few plays are performed repeatedly, which is boring. Moreover, because the supporting roles are paid too little, they are not very motivated, just going through the motions, making the performances less and less exciting.

Training Classes: Currently, only Shang Xiaoyun's Rongchun Society performs at Hua Bei Theater. The former Fuliancheng, Binqing, and other societies, as well as the Opera School, have all been closed for a long time.

In short, in Peiping, which is plagued by economic hardship and banditry, it is difficult for ordinary people to make a living. The once prosperous singing and dancing scene has become a thing of the past. Recalling the time twenty years ago when Yang, Yu, and Mei competed for supremacy, and the veteran performer Chen Dejun, also known as Yunfu, occasionally performed in charity shows, and the other famous performers, who were too numerous to count, one truly feels that "this music should only exist in heaven."

### The Freest Prison in the World

— Cang Yu

A Mexican man and his family had just finished a meal at a restaurant. As he and his wife and children walked onto the sidewalk, he said, "The time for meeting this week is over. Let's go back together—Dad has to go back to prison."

This is the life of an ordinary prisoner in a large prison in Mexico. Mexican prisons are the freest prisons in the world, always adhering to the principle of minimizing interference with prisoners' freedom. Prisoners can not only take their families out to eat but also continue to engage in trade or business. The law guarantees that prisoners receive the same wages as ordinary people.

Inside the Mexico City prison, daily necessities are available for sale. A prisoner opened a grocery store, and people flock to buy things every day because they know the store does business honestly. The store's sign often reads: "Refund if not satisfied" or "Ten-year-old store."

Along "Prison Street" are shops such as hat shops, clothing stores, barbershops, and shoe repair shops, all offering good prices and quality, and flourishing. In addition, there are also fairly good card printing shops and jewelry stores.

One prisoner is a lawyer who specializes in writing letters for the illiterate and petitioning the High Court for his fellow inmates. A notice is posted on the door of his prison office: "Time is money—please don't waste my time."

Another feature of this prison is that children can live with female inmates. When a mother is imprisoned, her children do not have to leave because prison officials believe that the presence of children will encourage female inmates to improve themselves. At the same time, the authorities strive to ensure that the children brought into the prison are not harmed. In the women's prison, we can see mothers walking back and forth on the main road with their children. Along both sides of the road are rows of rooms (these prison cells are large and furnished, with flowers and trees planted outside), with the doors open. There are also small schools near each prison, where children can be sent to study.

Outside the school is a large building where children can spend their time. From seven in the morning until bedtime, they play there. At the same time, they also eat, bathe, play ball, and so on... Everything is no different from ordinary social life.

Another feature of Mexican prisons is that they do not prohibit sexual activity. A married man can have his wife come in and stay with him. For this purpose, they usually have private rooms separate from the ordinary prison cells.

Unmarried men can also invite girlfriends to visit, but prostitutes are not allowed. A woman is only allowed to visit one male prisoner. Often, older people accompany unmarried women.

According to Mexican law, 40% of a prisoner's income should be given to the victim of the prisoner's crime. For example, a murderer sentenced to life imprisonment must give nearly half of his income to the victim's family. Thirty percent of the income supports the prisoner's own family, and the remaining 30% is saved.

In addition, anyone entering a Mexican prison must receive compulsory education. Each prison has an attached school. Prisoners with higher education serve as teachers.

### A Mistake in Mr. Tang Wei's Recording

— Gao Junbin

Mr. Tang Wei's complete set of ten reading recording discs was produced and circulated by the Dayouhua Record Factory in this city. The current factory director, Mr. Fan Shizheng, was my classmate at Nanyang University. This action is commendable for enriching the art world and benefiting the national essence. Mr. Wei's reading method, with its intonation, pauses, high and low pitches, fast and slow tempos, and moving voice, has its own profound principles. My father heard it and liked it, so he asked me to buy a set. After listening carefully, I discovered that in the tenth disc, the sixth line of Tang Ruoqin's (Mr. Wei's late father) Spring Festival poem, "Peach branches hang drums and paint tigers," the "drum" character in "hang drums" seems to be a mistake for the "talisman" character. So, I inquired with Mr. Wei, who replied in a letter: "Mr. Chuiwan is insightful. The 'drum' in my late father's Spring Festival poem is indeed a mistake for the 'talisman' character. Because there is no manuscript of this poem, I only relied on my memory to recite it, so I dared not change it. The error has been perpetuated for decades. Fortunately, you have corrected it, and I am extremely grateful." From this, we can see that Mr. Wei had long suspected the difference in the character. Now, after discussing it with my father, he believes that the error can indeed be corrected. How admirable is his humility and respect! I record these few words to share with fellow enthusiasts.

### Under the Lamp

— Shi Shufan

Master Huang Binhong flew south from the old capital and settled by the lake. When passing through Shanghai, Ba Lin hosted a banquet for him in the art world, inviting Sanmu, Kongwo, Bai Jiao, Tang Yun, Gong Yu, and Buhou to drink with him. The old master spoke eloquently, and all those present listened attentively. Master Huang has an old residence, but it is in ruins and cannot be returned to.

Loose cloth and wide sleeves, genuine rustic charm,
Profound explanations, ears refreshed with new ideas.
Under the lamp, shadows float like the sea,
Who are the peers of the Tongguang era?

White pagoda, red walls, ancient surroundings,
Sloping streets, flower scenes all gone.
Lying high for ten years, no intention to return?
Bringing back the chaos of Yanyun after the war.

Empty fishing bay in the daytime,
Imagining seclusion in dreams!
Returning to West Lake in old age, still a guest,
Barriers of war, distant Huangshan.

The alley is desolate, the moon is the lamp,
Autumn arrives on the mountains, adding desolation.
No more recruitment halls in the pine pavilion,
Striking up residence with the whole family in Ma Lu.

I praised Mr. Wu Lie's article on currency reform, his words were clear and insightful, revealing the core issues. The principles are consistent throughout history, worthy of reference. (Mr. Gongming, from Piaoyang, rose from a successful candidate in the imperial examination to the position of magistrate, eventually serving as the transport commissioner of Jin-Qu Road in Zhejiang. During the Gengshen year, he defended Hangzhou and died in battle.) The full text includes a section specifically on inflation, citing three major causes of the failure of paper money: "promiscuous issuance," "triviality," and "frequent changes."

He said that with paper money as currency, it is easy to issue it. Because it is easy to issue, the amount increases daily, and if it increases, its value decreases, and if its value decreases, circulation is hindered. Good for Yelü Chucai's words to Yuan Shizu, "The officials of the Jin Dynasty considered issuing paper money as a profit, and considered collecting paper money as a taboo, to the point where ten thousand strings of cash were exchanged for one cake! Now, making paper money should be standardized in units of ten thousand ingots. Once there is a fixed format and limit, there will be no previous problems." By the middle of the Yuan Dynasty, the issuance of paper money increased greatly, rewarding foreign monks with twenty million strings, and the paper money system deteriorated again. This is the flaw of "promiscuous issuance." Yuan paper money had eleven denominations from fifty to one thousand. Paper money is intended to supplement coins. If it makes its own denominations, it will cause vendors to only know how to use paper, and there will be no coins in the world. When the paper money system fails, wealth will inevitably become trivial, which is the flaw of "triviality." The paper money system must be credible to be sustainable. Because of the failure of the paper money system, instead of deeply considering the reasons for the failure, new paper money is issued, and new paper money is used to exchange old paper money. Orders are reversed repeatedly, causing confusion among the people. As the new and old accumulate, the paper money system becomes more hindered, which is the flaw of "frequent changes." Knowing the flaws is necessary before discussing paper money, and knowing the flaws is necessary before using paper money.

The above "three flaws" can clarify the source of the disease; the "two knowledges" show the way to start treating the disease. (Knowing the flaws is necessary before discussing, knowing the flaws is necessary before using.) These are truly concise and essential words. As for paper money, with good systems and good usage, it is originally a good method, convenient for carrying, facilitating use, and regulating finance and activating the economy, such as the Jiaozi of the Song Dynasty, the Baochao of the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, and the Qiantie of the Qing Dynasty. But bad practices arise over time, often leading to harm to the people and the country, which also has its reasons: (1) It is abuse, such as during the Jin and Yuan dynasties, when it was used as a source of profit for extravagance, becoming a disguised form of tyrannical taxation; (2) It is expediency, such as during the Xianfeng reign of the Qing Dynasty, which was a severe period of confrontation with the Taiping army. Provinces fell, and financial resources were lacking, while military and administrative expenses were urgently needed, making it necessary to find a solution from "currency." The former was man-made, the latter was due to circumstances.

The solutions at that time: (1) was to take advantage of coins, increasing the weight and expanding the size of one Wen coin, making it "ten," "fifty," "hundred," and "five hundred," but the added copper was far less than these multiples. Lacking substance, it could not achieve practical results, only disrupting commerce and the market. (During the early years of the Republic of China, the "large copper coins" manufactured locally by the warlords of Sichuan resembled the Xianfeng large coins.) The Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue, Chongshi, Zhao Guang, successively reported the severe difficulties of the people's livelihood, and the Xianfeng Emperor immediately ordered them to be stopped. Xianfeng "Dang Wushi" coins can still be occasionally seen at antique stalls, which were left over from that time. (2) was to replace coins with paper. According to Luo Wen Zhong's Chronicle, when he was the governor of Hunan, he received 80,000 taels of paper money from the Ministry of Revenue to distribute as salaries. The financial commissioner asked how to handle it. Luo said, "One Dangbai coin still contains 1.45 Qian of copper and cannot be used, so how can paper the size of a foot be used as three taels of silver! This paper money can only be kept in the treasury."

The current inflation has various "external" and "internal" causes and is more complex than in the past. It is necessary to consider both international and post-war situations in various countries. However, the principles described in this article can still be learned from, so I will briefly analyze and explain them.
