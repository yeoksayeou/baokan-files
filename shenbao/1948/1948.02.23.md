### Soviet Suggestions Relayed by Foreign Media: Government Declares Absolutely Untrue, Rumors of Beijing-Shanghai Peace Talks Also Groundless

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] A telegram from Guling states that the airmail service, the only means of communication between Beijing and Guling, has been suspended for several days due to heavy rain, preventing people in the mountains from reading newspapers from Beijing and Shanghai. On the 22nd, the weather cleared up, and Chairman Chiang and his wife went out for a tour. He was unaware of the rumors of peace talks circulating in Beijing and Shanghai for the past two days, especially the news from the Associated Press.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] A report from the Shanghai Associated Press states that a Soviet official in China had expressed to our government his willingness to mediate the war to suppress the rebellion and bandits, and that Chairman Chiang had appointed senior officials to agree to resume peace talks. The Executive Yuan authorities have been instructed to issue a statement declaring that this matter is absolutely untrue and purely a groundless rumor intended to disturb public morale.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Regarding the Associated Press report that the Soviet Union is mediating the Chinese war, Shi Zhaoying, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was instructed to deny the rumor, declaring to reporters: "This news has no basis whatsoever, and the report is absolutely untrue." The TASS branch in Beijing also stated that they had not heard of this matter.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 22nd] Official sources here solemnly stated regarding the suggestion from the Soviet Union to mediate the Chinese civil war that, should such a suggestion be made, China would never consider it. Official sources further expressed disbelief in the possibility of the government resuming peace talks with the Communist Party, as suggested by US Ambassador Stuart earlier yesterday. A Kuomintang official stated that since the Communist Party has become a rebel, the stage of resolving the CCP issue through peaceful means has long passed. Other sources pointed out that there is considerable hope for US aid, even military aid, to pass through the US Congress, making the government even less willing to negotiate with the Communist Party than before. They further pointed out that during last year's Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, China firmly opposed the Soviet Union's attempt to discuss the China issue with Marshall and Bevin. At that time, the Chinese government believed that since China was not participating in the meeting, matters concerning the Chinese situation should not be included in the agenda. However, the same sources also feared that the Soviet suggestion to resume peace talks would strengthen the CCP's position, as the latter might demand excessive concessions from the government if peace talks were to take place.

### US Ambassador Issues Statement: Denies Making "Reopening of KMT-CCP Negotiations" Remark, Hopes for Close Cooperation Between Chinese Officials, Military, and People

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Ambassador Stuart received US reporters in Beijing on the morning of the 22nd and issued a statement explaining his views on the China issue, which are completely consistent with the letter to the Chinese people he published two days ago. His main aim is to encourage unaffiliated and non-partisan people in China to increase their concern for the government and to help the country seek welfare for the people. The Chinese Constitution has already been promulgated, and the people should strive for freedom under the Constitution. In the afternoon, the Ambassador again received Chinese reporters and issued a statement saying that the biggest reason for publishing the letter to the Chinese people a few days ago was the feeling that there had been three glorious achievements in Chinese history in the past 30 years: the overthrow of the Manchu Qing government, the Northern Expedition, and the War of Resistance Against Japan. In these three achievements, on the one hand, the leaders such as Mr. Sun Yat-sen in the past and Chairman Chiang today demonstrated their outstanding talents, and on the other hand, the people were able to unite and exert their strength. After the War of Resistance, most people felt distressed, at a loss, and ignored that China today already has a constitution to define the framework of national affairs. If the people can contribute their own strength under the Constitution, they can help the government complete the modernization of the democratic system. The Ambassador also said that the current problem is that the vast majority of the people have failed to unite under the Constitution to launch a new revolutionary movement.

The Ambassador continued: The Chinese people have shown good performance in the struggle against communism, but their forces are scattered, localized, and not collective and comprehensive. The Chinese people's understanding of communism is very clear. Communism is a representative of authoritarianism, and communism symbolizes the decline of human rights and the loss of humanity. The Chinese people not only have a mind but also an understanding of communism, which is not a problem. The problem is that the Chinese people cannot find a good, democratic, and effective path to struggle. In fact, this path is in front of us, which is the power given to us by the Constitution to reform politics. They are only passively dissatisfied with the current government and have not thought of participating in the government's reform work. How to reform? The most effective way is to gather together. There are many ways. Some people say to form a new political party, but the party must have a correct goal, organized for national democracy. At the same time, they themselves must believe that they can reflect the opinions of the majority of the people and strive for a democratic country. If the original political parties want to continue to survive and have the power, they must serve the majority of the people and lead the people to the right path. If someone asks me (the Ambassador said himself), a new revolutionary movement must have a leader, who is the leader? I can answer: "Chairman Chiang." Because only Chairman Chiang is trusted by the majority of the people, and only Chairman Chiang has the ability to lead the majority of the people. The current problem is that the majority of the people have failed to participate in the road of national affairs and exercise their civil rights. If the Chinese people can all exercise their civil rights, they can make the country焕然一新 and secure stability.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] US Ambassador to China Stuart, met alone with Feng Guozhen, director of the English Department of the Central News Agency, on the evening of the 22nd, and denied that he had told the Associated Press that "the most likely solution to the China issue is the reopening of negotiations between the KMT and the CCP." The Ambassador narrated his statement in response to the Associated Press reporter, saying: "What I told the Associated Press reporter is the same as the opinion I stated a few days ago. I said that when China is facing such a serious situation, those who love their country, especially educated patriots, seem to have a great opportunity and responsibility to work together to study what is the country's problem, and to awaken and guide the people of the whole country so that they can realize a democratic government. If so, the intellectuals' distrust of the government will surely disappear, and they will support the government and strive for peace in China." The Ambassador continued: "I know that some people have made special efforts before Mr. Gullman (referring to the Associated Press reporter in Beijing) raised special questions, but I don't know the details. I think the United States seems to consistently hope that China can find a way to end the civil war. I think the Chinese people can hope to find a way to unite and solve their various difficulties. I didn't specify what kind of solution or how to solve it. The United States' policy is the same as in the past. The United States is giving China aid in the hope that before China may obtain other fundamental solutions, US aid can give China temporary relief." The Ambassador stated that he had summoned US reporters in Beijing this morning to explain the misunderstanding caused by the Associated Press report. The Ambassador said that the Associated Press reporter had apologized for misunderstanding his statement. The Associated Press reporter himself thought that the paraphrase was correct, but his inference of my statement was absolutely not my original intention. Dr. Stuart continued to answer another question raised by the reporter, saying that the reason why he specifically pointed out intellectuals and educated people is because they have the ability to lead the people. He believes that these people can form a new party and make constructive criticisms of the government, or they can only establish a few groups to advocate some reform proposals and progressive movements. The Ambassador continued that the negative attitude adopted by intellectuals and educated people, such as the professors of some universities, towards the government surprised him very much. He hoped that some of those who criticized the government but had never done anything should actively fulfill their responsibilities under the new constitution to help solve the country's problems. At a time when Americans are paying full attention to the issue of aid to China, they expect China to launch such a progressive movement under the support of its government. The American people have high expectations for this so that their assistance can achieve its maximum effect. In order for the government to assist in the development of this progressive movement, China still needs its people to maintain a consistent spirit of loving the Kuomintang. This spirit was fully demonstrated in the Kuomintang's overthrow of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, the completion of the Northern Expedition, and the leadership of the entire country in the War of Resistance Against Japan. In the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance, the national public opinion unanimously supported Chairman Chiang. Ambassador Stuart believes that under this spirit, the progressive movement can proceed smoothly. The Ambassador continued: China's communist problem will eventually be resolved. He believes that the pacification of the Communist Party cannot rely solely on military force. The government should also try to eliminate the various factors that can nurture communism. The Ambassador pointed out that there should be close cooperation between the government of each province and the officials, military, and people of each county. He said that because Hebei Province has this kind of cooperation, it feels that it can fully control the situation in the province. The Ambassador said that he learned that the people of Northeast China hate communism, so this kind of cooperation between officials, military, and people is needed to improve the current situation. The Ambassador said that he believes that all problems can be solved, and said that he has always had the highest hope for the Chinese government and has always wholeheartedly supported the Chinese government. He hopes that wise men will give support to the government and help it improve the places that they are not satisfied with. The Ambassador did not mention the leaders of the government and said: "I have the greatest admiration for them. I have known many of them for many years. Compared with officials from other countries, they are really no worse."

### Chairman Chiang Concerned About Agricultural Loans: China Farmers Bank Plans a Scheme, Urgently Loans Over 5 Trillion in the First Half of the Year

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Chairman Chiang is extremely concerned about the issue of agricultural loans for this year. On January 6, he personally ordered the Joint Board of Four Banks, writing: "This year, the Joint Board of Four Banks should regard agricultural loans as the most important task, and must list as many agricultural loans as possible and decide quickly."

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 22nd] The Chinese government will provide aid to Chinese farmers in the amount of 10,000,000,000,000 yuan (approximately US$71,000,000). This proposal follows the decision on a special donation of 10,000,000,000,000 yuan, with the intention of suppressing the rich and helping the poor. This decision was made by the government at a meeting of the Joint Board of Directors, which is co-chaired by Chairman Chiang and Zhang Qun.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] According to sources concerned: the Central Bank's entrusted to various banks and bureaus to purchase finished products from manufacturers during the Spring Festival holiday has now come to an end. The total value of purchases is 32.4 billion national currency, of which coal accounts for 22.6 billion, and the remaining leather, cigarettes, matches, etc. account for 9.8 billion yuan. The disposal of the purchased finished products will be decided by the head office.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 22nd] In order to solve the difficulties of industrial loans and coal allocation, the industrial circles in northern Hunan recently appointed Li Jianting and five others to form a petition group, and they are scheduled to set off within days.

### Joint Board of Four Banks Handles Affairs: Reviews Lending Policy

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The Joint Board of Four Banks will hold a special review meeting at 9:00 am on the 23rd to review the loan principles and lending policies decided at the Board meeting on the 21st. Zhang Jiaao, Xu Baiyuan, and others will participate. The board will also hold a loan group review meeting in Shanghai on the 23rd, which will be convened by Liu Gongyun. Relevant personnel from the Joint Board of Four Banks have gone to Shanghai to participate.

### US Supplies Materials to Our Air Force: Already Loading Ships on Saipan, 150 Transport Planes Will Fly to China

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] State Department officials said on the 21st that materials supplied to the Chinese Air Force under the contract signed on November 6 were loaded onto several Chinese ships on Saipan last week. According to the contract of December 20, 150 transport planes sold to China will fly to China.

Secretary of State Marshall told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that China began loading munitions onto landing ships in the Mariana Islands on February 14. State Department officials said that the remaining supplies in Hawaii and the munitions contract in the Mariana Islands will be implemented quickly.

It also said that most of the materials have been packed and prepared for shipment.

However, none of the 150 transport planes sold to China have been delivered so far. US military assistance to China's anti-communist forces, including surplus munitions and aircraft, are supplied at greatly reduced prices.

The State Department has sent a memorandum to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, stating that in recent months, several contracts have been approved to sell wartime materials to the Chinese National Government.

This is obviously the State Department's response to Congress' criticism of the newly proposed economic aid to China of $570 million. Some congressmen have said that the plan is very inappropriate because it does not supply military materials, and only supplies aviation gasoline and oils.

### Kowloon Incident Negotiation: Sino-British Agreement Expected

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 22nd] A Foreign Ministry spokesman said on the 22nd that the differences between the Chinese and British governments on the Kowloon issue have "gradually narrowed," and an agreement is expected to be reached within two weeks.

It is said that both China and Britain have put forward several solutions, and future negotiations will determine a way for both parties to fulfill.

[United Press, Hong Kong, 22nd] It was learned today that the 29 suspects in the Shah Incident on the 16th of last month will open court.

### Australian Government Improves: Regulations on Chinese Immigration, Our External Negotiations Have Results

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] According to the report from the Western Australia Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, requesting negotiations with the Australian government to improve the regulations on Chinese immigration, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was requested to instruct our minister to Australia to actively negotiate. It is heard that an agreement was reached with the Australian government last year. The improved measures are as follows: (1) Chinese people who do business in Australia and have an annual trade volume of 2,500 Australian pounds can apply for one assistant. Vegetable garden workers with a total trade volume of 750 pounds can also apply for two assistants, and they can stay for five years. After the expiration, they can apply for an extension once. (2) When permanent residents die or retire, those with an annual trade volume of 2,500 pounds can ask Chinese to inherit the business. In the past, there was no such provision. (3) Chinese businessmen who trade in Australia with 500 pounds of capital are considered import and export merchants and can live for seven years. If the capital increases by 500 pounds, they can apply for one more assistant. (4) Chinese people residing in Australia can bring their families and live for five years, and can apply for an extension of five years after the expiration. (5) If Chinese people in Australia need to change their careers, it must be decided by the Chinese Consulate and the Australian Immigration Department. In the past, it was almost not allowed to change careers. (6) Chinese students who go to Australia to study must have their parents in Australia and be between the ages of ten and fourteen before they are allowed to enter the country. Now, as long as there is a guardian who can provide a guarantee deposit of 100 pounds, they can enter the country. Junior high school students can stay for three years, and can apply for an extension when the limit is reached. There is no time limit for college students, and it is purely limited to the completion of the course. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has informed the various overseas Chinese affairs bureaus.

The bandit will restore utilization, now strong 工　　　　　　立屯 railway, about kilometers long.

Yesterday at 6:00 pm, four elders from the Northeast arrived in Shanghai from Beiping. From right to left, Ma Zhanshan, Wan, Zhang Zuoxiang, Zhang Yuanfu. (Photo by Central News Agency)

### Ma Zhanshan and Others Arrive in Shanghai: Say the Situation in the Northeast Is Not as Serious as Reported, Will Go to Beijing Tonight to Meet Chairman Chiang and Discuss Major Plans

[Our Report] Four Northeastern elders Ma Zhanshan, Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, and Zhang Yuanfu, accompanied by several followers, flew to Shanghai from Beiping on a China Airlines "Air King" special plane at 2:50 pm on the 22nd, and arrived at Longhua Airport at 6:05 pm. Shi Bingyan and Shi Weipu, standing directors of the Northeastern Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, and Wang Defu and others, representatives of the Beijing Fellow Villagers Association, went to the airport to welcome them. After arriving in Shanghai, Ma and others were taken to the board of directors of the China Industrial Bank in Xieqiao Lane by Fu Rulin, president of the bank, for a short rest. According to Ma Zhanshan, they will visit Chairman Chiang in Beijing to discuss major plans for the Northeast, but they did not bring a "suggestion" as rumored outside. The recent situation in the Northeast is not as serious as reported outside, and the military strength in various places is sufficient to maintain local security. As for whether Ma himself will participate in planning the actual military affairs of the Northeast again, it will be decided after the central government's instructions. Regarding Zhang Xueliang's return to power, as of now, there is no sign. Wan Fulin told reporters that he believes that organizing and training the militia is an urgent task in the Northeast. Zhang Zuoxiang said that he has been away from the Northeast for a long time and is not very clear about the local situation. Zhang Yuanfu said that the four of them are scheduled to take a train to Beijing on the evening of the 23rd. Before departure (3:00 pm), they decided to host Chinese and foreign journalists at the board of directors of the China Industrial Bank to report on the current situation in the Northeast.

[Another Dispatch] Northeastern elders Wang Shuchang, Zhai Wenxuan, and Mi Chunlin in Tianjin set sail for Shanghai by ship on the 21st, and are expected to arrive on the 24th, and then transfer to Beijing to meet with Ma and others.

### Chen Cheng Meets Zou Zuohua

Expresses That There Is No Need to Be Pessimistic About the Situation in the Northeast

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng met with Zou Zuohua at 11:00 am on the 22nd and expressed that the current situation in the Northeast is by no means as difficult as reported outside. The National Army has all the pre-arranged deployments, and it is certain that it can contain the bandit army's offensive, and there is no reason for pessimism. The Northeastern elders suggested strengthening local forces, and the government intends to adopt it. The detailed measures are being studied by the relevant authorities. Wei Lihuang had asked Zou to make a report to Chen Cheng on his behalf, and Zou had relayed it on behalf of Chen during his visit.

[Another Telegram] After arriving in Beijing, Zou Zuohua has successively visited Mo Dehui, Liu Zhe, and other Northeastern elders to exchange opinions, and is scheduled to visit President Zhang on the 23rd to make a report and ask for instructions. According to Zou, he came to Beijing this time to take up the new position of strategic consultant and, at the same time, to discuss with the Northeastern elders the measures to strengthen the military force in the Northeast at the call of the central government. Besides, there are no other tasks. Zou believes that the evolution of the situation in the Northeast to this day is due to the wrong views of the receiving officials, who should bear great responsibility. The official believed that diplomatic negotiations could take over the Northeast. When the people of the Northeast were eagerly looking forward to the government taking over after the victory, peace talks were actively pursued, which led to the increasing strength of the bandits. This also gave the Communists a good opportunity to develop. Now the foundation of the Communists in the Northeast is solid, and it is difficult to eliminate them in the short term, but the Communists' attempt to enter the pass from the Northeast will never succeed. The Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact is Automatically Extended

### Shi Zhaoying Speaks

The Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact is Automatically Extended

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Shi Zhaoying, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated on the 22nd regarding the continued extension of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact for two years: The pact was signed on August 21, 1937, and its Article 4 stipulates that the validity period is five years. If either of the contracting parties believes that there is no need to continue, it can notify the other party six months before the expiration (before February 21) to declare its termination, otherwise it will be automatically extended for two years. After the extension of two years, the method of treaty survival will be the same. The pact was automatically extended three times in 1942, 1944, and 1946. This year is another time for decision, but as of the 21st, neither party has submitted a notice declaring termination, so the pact will be automatically extended for another two years after its fourth expiration on August 21 this year, until August 21, 1950.

### Communists Sign Secret Far East Trade Pact with Soviet Union

### Mayor Li of Qingdao Arrived in Beijing: Petitioned for Opening of Industrial and Commercial Loans

Also hoping to solve the coal and grain panic in Qingdao.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] Mayor of Qingdao, Li Xianliang, came to Beijing from Qingdao on the evening of the 21st to request the Central Government to resolve the difficulties of coal and grain shortage in Qingdao and to appeal for the opening of industrial and commercial loans in Qingdao. According to Mr. Li's conversation with reporters on the evening of the 22nd: Qingdao is short of coal and grain, and the number of refugees concentrated in Qingdao is the highest in the country, resulting in three major difficulties in Qingdao. After the loans were stopped, Qingdao's industry and commerce lacked working capital, and many factories are in danger of closing down. (Continued on page 2, column 4)

### Belgian Missionary's Special Plane Detained in Kunming for Unauthorized Entry

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 22nd] A special plane belonging to a Belgian missionary, which flew from Calcutta to Wujiaba Airport in Kunming at 2:30 PM today, was detained by the Fifth Air Force General Station because it had not obtained permission from our government and had intruded into our airspace without authorization, violating international civil aviation reciprocity agreements. It will only be allowed to leave Kunming after the Belgian Embassy negotiates with our government for permission. The plane carried a total of eight Belgian missionaries, who were originally scheduled to fly directly from Calcutta to Hong Kong, but landed in Kunming due to insufficient fuel.

### Bandits in Western Shandong Crossed the Yellow River and Fled Northward; Bandits Invading Lanfeng in Eastern Henan Were Defeated; Weichuan County Town Recaptured by Troops Yesterday

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 22nd] One regiment of Chen Yi's bandit troops has crossed the north bank of the Yellow River at Sunkou, and the remaining five regiments are still in southwestern Shandong, where they are being suppressed by the National Army.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 22nd] The 1st, 4th, and part of the 6th regiments of Chen Yi's bandits in western Shandong have been attacked by the National Army for days. Most of them are in the southwestern area of the city, and part of them fled north across the Yellow River from Linji on the 21st.

### Bandit Situation in Residual Areas of Shandong

[Our Yanzhou Dispatch, 22nd] The bandits who have fled back to southwestern Shandong have increased their numbers to eight columns. Among them, except for parts of two columns, which are still lingering in eastern Henan due to being encircled and suppressed by the National Army, two columns are in the area south of Shanxian County, and another part has returned to the north bank of the Yellow River. The remaining approximately four columns are still wandering in the triangular area north of Heze and Cao County. Chen Yi's headquarters has also fled to Hongchuankou, southwest of Dancheng. Chen Yi's original goal was to be in the Central Plains, but after being severely suppressed by the National Army, he believed that southwestern Shandong was a relatively safe area, so he fled back for reorganization. However, after the two battles of Zhuliao and Caoxian Dintao, the bandits suffered annihilating blows, resulting in a part of the remnant bandits having to cross the river first. The attempt to use this to reorganize and restore their strength has been severely挫敗. In eastern Shandong, Chen Yi originally had only four columns, but recently it has been reported that five local regiments have been formed into a new column, but their combat power is negligible. In central Shandong, the bandit's central Shandong headquarters has been moved to Lucun (southeast of Laiwu) in the Yimeng山区 area, and 10,000 new soldiers are being trained in Puli, southwest of Lucun, and 5,000 new soldiers are being trained in Zhuzhuang, southeast of Lucun. The National Army has prepared a plan for suppression, and it will not be difficult to subdue them.

### The Construction Problem of Provincial Enterprises

— An Ren

(I)

Post-war economic construction involves countless tasks. Broadly speaking, it is nothing more than state-owned and private enterprises. State-owned enterprises include local enterprises, and local enterprises are provincial enterprises. Provincial enterprises and state-owned enterprises complement each other and are mutually utilized. Only then can various national industries be developed in an orderly manner. Recently, since Mr. Song Ziwen took charge of provincial administration in Guangdong, he has attached great importance to promoting economic construction. As a result, provincial enterprises have gradually become a dynamic business. I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the future of provincial enterprises.

State-owned and provincial enterprises have their basic conditions. If these basic conditions are lost, the effectiveness of state-owned and provincial enterprises will also gradually disappear. The basic conditions for state-owned and provincial enterprises: (1) It must take the most advantageous route. (2) It must be what the state and locality need most. (3) It must be what individuals and a small number of people cannot manage and can take sole responsibility for. (4) It must choose the most suitable location in the locality, and the supply and export of raw materials have the prospect of development. With these basic conditions, both state-owned and provincial enterprises can be expected to exert the greatest effect. However, there are various ancillary conditions that both state-owned and provincial enterprises must pay attention to: (1) The profits of this kind of state-owned and provincial enterprise must all be turned over to the public without any omissions. (2) The person in charge of this kind of state-owned and provincial enterprise and all its staff members must be honest and law-abiding and absolutely not corrupt. (3) The person in charge of this kind of state-owned and provincial enterprise and its staff members must be experienced and technically proficient talents in this kind of enterprise and absolutely not place private individuals to benefit themselves at public expense. (4) After the profits of this kind of state-owned and provincial enterprise are turned over to the state treasury and provincial treasury, it is guaranteed that the capital can be increased again to create new state-owned and provincial enterprises and absolutely not be diverted to other non-productive enterprises. (5) A portion of the net profits of this kind of state-owned and provincial enterprise is used to increase the various happiness and benefits of the people and is designated for use, so that it will not be converted into bureaucratic capital and harm the future development of state-owned and provincial enterprises. (6) Although this kind of state-owned enterprise is not solely for profit, the profits it obtains increase the benefits to consumers. (7) This kind of state-owned and provincial enterprise must be strictly managed by officials, with economical expenditures, avoiding bureaucratic style and habits, and professional personnel who are not changed easily. The above seven points are all ancillary conditions that state-owned and provincial enterprises should pay extreme attention to. If these seven ancillary conditions can be truly achieved, then we can wish for the future of our country's public enterprises. If public enterprises run counter to these seven ancillary conditions, then their future will soon fall into failure.

(II)

How to divide provincial enterprises and private enterprises is a problem that is currently not easy to solve. (1) From the perspective of regulating capital: If private enterprises develop to the extreme and the state adopts a laissez-faire policy, allowing private enterprises to develop freely, then it will fall into the path of capitalism and cannot be changed. Therefore, provincial enterprises should focus on regulating capital, exerting the power of local capital and expanding it for large-scale industries, so as not to excessively expand private enterprises and concentrate capital and wealth in one corner. (2) From the perspective of China's post-war economic construction: The eight-year war was harmed by Japanese aggression, and the people's capital and productivity suffered a great blow. The people who were腾　　的大　　为小　，小　　　赤贫. Eight out of ten people have fallen into the hunger line and hope that they can shoulder the responsibility of post-war economic construction, which is not easy to do at present. I believe that both state-owned and provincial enterprises should bear the heavy responsibility of post-war economic construction. After the public's vitality has recovered slightly, a small part of the public enterprises can be transferred to private management, and then the root and branch will not be misplaced. (3) From the perspective of supporting the people's enterprises: If all established and emerging industries are run by state-owned and provincial enterprises, although it is to develop national capital, it is not within the reach of the country's resources, and in the current situation of various outdated industries in the country, even if there are resources, it is impossible to do. In order to take care of the construction of various industries after the war, both national capital and people's capital must be expanded at the same time before they can work together. How to support the people's capital to make up for the shortcomings of public enterprises? I think that giving the people various conveniences for building industries and protecting their strength, on the one hand, absorbing overseas Chinese capital so that overseas Chinese capital can be concentrated on the development of various industries, and on the other hand, absorbing the people's idle capital so that it does not move towards speculation, hoarding, and non-productive paths, but towards the road of industrial construction. This depends on the government's good-will leadership. (4) From the perspective of the development of public (provincial) enterprises: Each locality should internally reorganize its existing industries so that they can strengthen their foundation and not be abandoned halfway. It should also allow a part of the shares of the promising new industries to be purchased by overseas Chinese shares and business shares, and use the collected capital to build new factories by provincial enterprises, one after another, so that economic construction can achieve the desired goal. This is a method of 推陳出新, and also a method of 暗渡陳倉. (5) From the perspective of cracking down on bureaucratic capital: The enterprises and companies operated by bureaucratic capital are neither public nor private, but a distorted phenomenon of economic development. These companies appear to be similar to state-owned or private enterprises, but they are neither fish nor fowl. In fact, bureaucratic capital uses the signboard of state-owned and public enterprises as a cover, and uses its political pressure to monopolize the commercial industries or distribute materials in trading ports. As for private commercial firms that want to import light and heavy industrial equipment and materials with legal procedures, their import licenses and requests for foreign exchange settlement are often shelved. This is what those who want to develop national capital and local capital to build people's livelihood industries should not ignore.

(III)

From the perspective of the Measures for the Reorganization of Provincial Enterprises promulgated by the Executive Yuan: The Measures for the Reorganization of Provincial Enterprises of each province promulgated by the Executive Yuan on October 30th last year (1947), as far as I can see, do not currently support the provincial government in operating various enterprises and selling them to private management immediately, but must take the fourth point method mentioned above. Because the general situation of the economic chaos after the war has a great impact on the people, even those with right resources may not be willing to inherit all of a certain type of enterprise, and even if they inherit it, how is the management and distribution plan, how is the experience and technology of the staff, and may not be able to cope with the current effective enterprise and continue to develop it. For example, allowing the people to purchase part of its stocks, and the government and the people jointly operate it, and achieve common steps. If we cooperate and work together, the development can be拭目以待. Now I will talk about the construction problem of Guangdong provincial enterprises. Most of Guangdong's provincial enterprises tend to be heavy industry. Guangdong is located in a remote coastal area, and its transportation with the world is earlier, and its emerging industry is basically higher than other provinces, but in fact it is not, compared with Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces,瞠平其后. According to estimates, there are more than 2,000 private factories in the province, most of which are small handicraft factories with immature technology and simple equipment, and are not considered large-scale industries. In recent years, due to the impact of the economic downturn, half of them have closed down, and the survivors are also in difficulty. As for the province's Guan营 factories, there were originally 28, and there were also 9 small Ying工厂, but all of them lacked machinery and raw materials. Each of the former three has stopped production and sold them, and only two of the latter can barely support them. In Guangzhou in October last year, there were more than 300 textile factories, now there are only more than 200; at the beginning of the resumption of cigarette factories, there were 192, now there are only 6; in February last year, there were more than 30 larger rubber factories, and about 200 household handicraft factories, now there are only about 20 of the former. It can be seen that the province's industry was revived for a while after the recovery, but then gradually declined. Based on the above statistics, it can be seen that the current situation of Guangdong's industry is that it should develop provincial enterprises and build various industries, and use the government's power to supplement and encourage the size of private industries.

(IV)

Afterwards, Guangdong's public enterprises that have now resumed work include the cement plant under the jurisdiction of the Construction Office. There are six companies under the jurisdiction of Guangdong Industrial Company: Shunde Sugar Factory, Textile Factory, Beverage Factory, Ice Making Factory, Brewery, and Machinery Factory. In addition, there are three companies in preparation: the Chemical Industry Factory, Silk Weaving Factory, and Industrial Experiment Factory of the Construction Department; several factories are being reorganized and planned, including the Guangzhou Paper Factory, Meilu Ramie Weaving Factory, Transportation Equipment Factory, Printing Factory, and Maoming Sugar Factory of Guangdong Industrial Company. The lack of Guangdong's emerging provincial industries is so great. In future construction, the existing factories should be reorganized and planned: What is the situation of its production and sales? How is the allocation of its raw materials? How is its labor technology? How is its management method? How is its promotion scope? How is its machinery power? All should be taken into account one by one, and then people can be used to their talents, land can be used to its advantages, things can be used to their full extent, and goods can be circulated smoothly.

(V)

After the First World War, the Soviet Union entered a new construction period in 1928. The Five-Year Plan was not a figment of the Soviet Union's imagination, but was decided by the Soviet authorities based on the situation of the national economy at that time and after the consideration of thousands of experts. During the revival period, the Soviet Union's power generation and machinery power manufacturing had been fully developed, and there were so-called guiding industrial sectors. The development of this industrial sector, in the view of the Soviet authorities, had a decisive significance for industrialization. How is the development of China's construction and Guangdong's construction after the war? In the future revival period, the guidance of the industrial sector has its own decisive significance. Now, focusing on the industrial construction of Guangdong: I believe that the ice making factory and beverage factory should be sold to private management in their entirety (if the people have the ability to bear it), and their funds should be transferred to equipment (1) Guangdong Food Production and Sales Management Company, or Food Production and Sales Administration. It is necessary to give priority to purchasing and storing food from all parts of the province and food imported from overseas, and then sell it to food stores and food merchants in various places, stipulating prices and reselling it for them. After there are many materials in the food production and sales company operated in the province, then we can talk about food control, food management, food distribution, and food can be grasped and tend to be stable, and then the prices of various commodities can not rise with the rise of gold and foreign exchange. (1) Expand the machinery manufacturing plant. The industrial company originally had a machinery factory, which has been transferred to the textile factory management, in order to 大　　　　　大量 agricultural implements. This factory can be expanded separately to become a machinery manufacturing factory. The main purpose of the Soviet Union's industrial construction was to turn an industrially backward agricultural country into a modern industrialized country. In the four years after 1932, the Soviet Union's machinery manufacturing had increased four times, such as aircraft manufacturing, aircraft engine manufacturing, chemical machinery manufacturing, automobile manufacturing, steel equipment manufacturing, metallurgical machinery manufacturing, mining machine manufacturing, textile machinery manufacturing, printing machine manufacturing, instrument manufacturing, and radio manufacturing. China's construction after the war should take Guangdong in South China as the main base. Only by paying attention to the expansion of this kind of machinery factory can we enter a brand-new period. (3) Establishment of a transportation equipment factory. In the first Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union prepared to build about 60,000 kilometers of national roads, and the reconstruction of old roads was planned to be one million kilometers. However, the problem caused by the highway is the increased need for automobiles. Before the revolution, the Soviet Union did not have an automobile factory, and all automobiles were imported from foreign countries. Therefore, the Moscow factory and the Yaroslaf automobile factory were specially built, and a further step was taken to build an automobile factory. All the equipment was handled by the American Ford Motor Company, and it could produce 100,000 automobiles annually. The construction of our country's current transportation agencies is not talked about for a while, and the construction of transportation agency equipment can be manufactured by various provinces. If the financial resources are insufficient for a while, you can entrust the American company to invest in setting up factories in the transportation districts of various provinces to manufacture. This is the idea of Sun Yat-sen to absorb foreign capital in the industrial plan. (4) Establishment of a food canning factory. Guangdong is famous for producing fruits. The fruits produced annually are no less than dozens of kinds. Because the canning industry is underdeveloped, the fruits produced cannot be preserved for a long time due to time constraints, and today the goods are discarded on the ground, and many good fruits cannot be stored in cans and transported abroad, which is a pity. This is what I hope the Guangdong Industrial Company will establish recently to complete it. (5) Establishment of a fertilizer factory. Guangdong produces less than tens of millions of stones of food every year. This is due to the fact that many wasteland has not been developed and cannot be produced as much as possible, and it is also due to the insufficient supply of fertilizers to general farmers. Even if there is an import of foreign fertilizers, the value is very expensive, and general poor farmers cannot purchase them. I believe that the Guangdong Industrial Company should quickly design and establish this factory; for Guangdong丰业　　　　　　, should not think　　　　　　　either.

(VI)

The above is just about Guangdong Province. In fact, our country is an industrially backward country, so that all provinces can work hard on the construction of emerging industries in the future, and after five years, it is not difficult to move towards the road of revival by proceeding according to the prescribed planned steps. In the past ten years, the Soviet Union has progressed from an agricultural country to an industrial country, and its journey has many things that we can imitate. The Soviet Union's New Economic Policy is the same as Sun Yat-sen's economic policy. The Soviet Union has revived the country with three five-year plans and has tracked the advanced countries, and China's post-war construction is confident that it can also strive forward and keep pace with them. According to the Guangdong Five-Year Construction Plan, the premise is to seek sufficient supply of steel, and the five-year industrial construction is headed by the steel industry, and the iron ores of Qiongya, Yunfu, Lechang, Ruyuan, Yangshan, Zijin, and Xinyi are used to establish a foundation for ironmaking. With the production of steel, the use of various mother machines and sub-machines can naturally inherit and develop from the machinery industry. However, this creation is not easy, and I deeply hope that Chairman Song, who is in charge of provincial administration, and those who are responsible for construction, will gradually cultivate it, which is the humble intention of the writer.

### Zhenjiang Rice Prices Turn Stable

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 22nd] Zhenjiang rice prices are slightly stable today because the weather has cleared. The opening price of top-quality rice is 2.1 million, but oil prices remain high due to high prices in the production area. Soybean oil is now sold for 5.5 million per 100 jin. According to a rice merchant in Hexia, the rice prices in Zhenjiang and Wuxi rose after the Spring Festival. A large number of grain boats from the Anhui province production area originally planned to sell directly in Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Shanghai. However, because Nanling and other counties in Anhui province require a tax of 12 jin per stone of rice leaving the country to subsidize the county security expenses, the grain merchants dare not rashly sell because of the heavy burden. It is also known that there are more than 100 grain boats currently滞留 in Nanling and other places.

### The Real Culprit in the Murder of Xu Shoushang Was Arrested

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 22nd] The real culprit in the murder of Xu Shoushang, the head of the Chinese Literature Department of National Taiwan University, has been arrested. The Taiwan Provincial Police Department announced at 10:00 PM today: The murderer in this case is Gao Wanche, a 22-year-old resident of Taipei City. He was a laborer hired by Xu when he was the director of the Taiwan Provincial Translation and Compilation Office. According to Gao's confession: On the night of the 18th, when he sneaked into Xu's house to steal, he was discovered by Mr. Xu, so he acted cruelly. The lost clothing box from Xu's house and the bloody clothes worn by the murderer have also been recovered. The murderer also confessed to the stabbing. Reporters asked Xu Shiying, Xu Shishen, and Tang Zhaoheng, three members of Mr. Xu's family, for their opinions on the case. They replied: "This is a case of谋财害命. We will wait for the court to resolve it." Xu Shijuan also said: "My father was a scholar who was kind to people throughout his life. Now he has lost his life like this, which makes me feel sad about the world." Gao Wanche will be punished according to law. Other suspects arrested in this case have been released.

### Bandit Bohai Military Sub-district Commander Zhao Jizhou Ousted Due to Infighting

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 22nd] Internal strife among the bandits in North China is intensifying. High-ranking officials and factions are ousting each other. For example, Zhao Jizhou, commander of the Third Military Sub-district of the Bandit Bohai Military Region, was recently dismissed and investigated by the Bandit East China Military Region Headquarters.

### After Hebei Teachers' College Merged with Ping Normal University, Students Opposing the Entrance Exam Beat Students Who Support It

Attack Carried out Behind Closed Doors, Five People Injured

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 22nd] Students from Hebei Provincial Teachers' College engaged in a major brawl in Beiping over the issue of merging with National Beiping Normal University. After the Ministry of Education ordered the merger, the Teachers' College students came to Beiping and resided at 22 Chengfang Street, awaiting participation in the Normal University's placement exam. However, due to repeated refusals by some students to participate in the exam, a stalemate ensued. Yin Zuying, the dean of general affairs of the Normal University, upon assuming the post of Commissioner of Education of Hebei Province, formulated three measures in conjunction with the Normal University to give the Teachers' College students another opportunity: (1) all Teachers' College students must participate in the placement exam; (2) students who do not participate in the exam will be dismissed; (3) students who participate in the exam but are not admitted will be placed by the Department of Education. These measures were conveyed to the students by Jin Zhuofeng, the principal of the Teachers' College. On the 20th, over eighty Teachers' College students visited Yin, demanding a guarantee of admission to the Normal University. Yin refused. The petitioning students returned without achieving their goal. That night, some students who opposed participating in the entrance exam drove the students who supported participation to the central courtyard, tightly closed the gates, and beat them. Fortunately, no weapons were used. Security authorities arrived after hearing the news, preventing a major incident. Only five people were injured. Currently, Commissioner Yin, for safety, has moved those who support participation in the entrance exam to the Normal University, while those who oppose it remain at the original location. However, they may still participate in the entrance exam if they wish. The Normal University's placement exam is scheduled for the 24th and 25th.

### Qingdao Mayor Requests Opening of Loans

(Continued from Page 1) His visit is specifically to request the central government to find a solution. Regarding the food issue, it is proposed to request the central government to allocate 300,000 bags of flour, 60,000 bags of rice, and 60,000 bags of coarse grains to alleviate the current urgent needs. Li arrived in Nanjing on the 21st and immediately visited Food Commissioner Yu Feipeng that evening. In principle, Yu agreed to assist, but the specific methods are still under discussion. Regarding the coal issue, Qingdao requires approximately 30,000 tons of coal each month. Currently, the central government only ships over 15,000 tons of coal to Qingdao each month, while the power plant alone requires over 12,000 tons of coal, which is insufficient. It is proposed to request the central government to supply 30,000 tons each month. The issues of refugees and opening up loans will also be discussed with relevant agencies to find solutions. Li is scheduled to visit President Zhang Qun on the 23rd to report on the food and coal difficulties in Qingdao and the issues awaiting resolution. On the morning of the 22nd, Li visited Zhang Jia'ao to request the opening of loans to save Qingdao's industrial and commercial crisis. Zhang replied that the opening of loans is a comprehensive issue. If loans are opened, Qingdao will also be handled according to the general situation. However, currently, apart from the method of purchasing finished products, loans have not been restored.

### Cooperative Enterprises Association Opens Fifth Annual Meeting

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The 22nd marked the eighth anniversary of the establishment of the China Cooperative Enterprises Association. The association held the opening ceremony of its fifth annual meeting at the Jieshou Hall. Attendees included Chen Guofu, Shao Lizi, Li Zonghuang, Hong Lanyou, Zhao Baoquan, Xie Zhengfu, Tang Qiyu, as well as representatives from the Ministries of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Forestry, and Finance, and Liu Siying, Ye Qianji, Zhou Zhenhua, and Zhang Jingrui from the Four Joint Offices, totaling over 300 people. Representatives from the Taiwan branch associations, Gao Liangzuo, Huang Nanyang, and Su Haishui, traveled from afar to participate for the first time, which is truly commendable. The conference began at 9:00 AM with ceremonial proceedings. Chairman Shou Miancheng, the director-general, reported that future work should strengthen the association's affairs, attract socially enthusiastic cooperative individuals as members, and strengthen publicity to transform resistance into assistance. Agricultural cooperation should be the focus of China's cooperative movement. The government is currently focusing on the production of food, cotton, and export goods, and cooperative organizations should closely coordinate with them. The Constitution has clearly stipulated that cooperative enterprises should receive national encouragement and assistance, which is the focus of discussion. It is hoped that everyone will express their opinions for the government to adopt and implement. Committee Member Chen Guofu, Secretary-General Shao Lizi, Secretary-General Li Zonghuang, and others delivered speeches successively, followed by the singing of the Cooperative Song and a group photo. Lunch was held at noon, and the meeting continued at 2:00 PM in the afternoon to amend the association's charter, pass the amended outline of the China Cooperative Movement, and over twenty other proposals. A general outline of the principles of how the state should encourage and assist cooperative enterprises during the constitutional period was passed and handed over to the association's board of directors to continue researching detailed plans.

### Main Culprit in Changchun Gold Case Fined 50 Million Circulation Certificates

Used for Refugee and Infant Relief

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 22nd] The Changchun gold case that caused a sensation in the city has recently been decided by the joint meeting of Changchun city party, government, and military cadres, with a fine imposed as punishment.

### Amidst Talk of Government Staff Reductions, First Cut Dry-Salary Personnel

"Hunan Daily" Writes Article Advocating It

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] According to news from Changsha, amidst the nationwide implementation of government staff reductions, the "Hunan Daily" in Changsha recently published an article advocating that "the province's staff reductions should start with the councilors receiving dry salaries." According to the newspaper, these councilors are mostly concurrently serving as provincial councilors and openly receiving dry salaries, which is extremely illegal and has long been ridiculed by the public. However, "let them laugh and scold as they please, I will still receive my dry salary." In the dictionary of provincial councilors receiving dry salaries, there are no words for "integrity" or "shame." During the last provincial council meeting, some people, driven by conscience, proposed "not receiving councilor's dry salaries," but ultimately, due to the belief that "personal integrity is a small matter, legal tender is a big matter," no conclusion was reached. This is a stain on the history of Hunan's civil governance.

### Haihe Engineering Bureau Formulates New Ge Village Cut-off Plan

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 22nd] The Haihe Engineering Bureau, in order to improve the Haihe waterway, has recently formulated a Ge Village Cut-off Plan and will request special funds from the Executive Yuan for construction. Regarding the Ge Village Cut-off, during the enemy-puppet period, the Japanese had started construction based on our country's pre-war plan. The new river channel had been excavated for 1,808 meters, but was later interrupted. In the original plan, the new river channel was to be 8,400 meters long, which was too large a project and lacked funding. The Haihe Engineering Bureau's new plan has shortened the river channel project to 4,880 meters. After excavating 3,072 meters in addition to what the Japanese had already done, it can be completed. It is estimated to take three years and cost 125.9 billion.

### US Reaction to Aid China Plan

[United Press, Washington, 21st] Regarding the government's proposed $570 million aid to China plan, an initial trend is quite evident in the first few days of discussion in public and private sectors, newspapers, and Congress: the plan clearly displeases all sides.

Those who previously enthusiastically supported aid to President Chiang's government now deem the plan "extremely inappropriate."

Some argue that the plan lacks military assistance, while others say that it does not stipulate any efforts to stabilize China's currency system. Still others believe that both should be addressed.

On the other hand, those who previously vehemently opposed aid to the central government believe that the proposed plan is simply a waste of money. They believe that since it will have no practical effect in China, it would be better to use it elsewhere or save it.

Observers believe that those who have no strong opinions on the issue of aid to China are now confused by the debates on all sides and do not know what to do.

President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall's statements regarding the plan are seen here as indicating that the plan was proposed at the request of the Republican Party, not because the government genuinely believes that proposing the plan at this time is of any benefit.

Marshall bluntly told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that if Congress cannot discuss the aid to Europe plan and the aid to China plan simultaneously, then it can pass the aid to Europe bill first, leaving out the China portion. This statement gave everyone the above impression.

Although Marshall admitted that without American aid, the Chinese government might collapse, allowing the communists to control all of China north of the Yangtze River, thereby weakening America's position in Korea and Japan, he still made this argument.

This statement also failed to dispel confusion about the government's true intentions.

On the other hand, those who oppose providing large sums of money to aid China have proposed various different suggestions. Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton requested that the United States enter China with a substantially large aid plan to control the entire situation.

Chow Yide and the Washington Post, whose opinions on China issues are often consistent, now both agree that silver coins should be used to recall the current highly inflationary paper currency.

Conservative Evening Star columnist Blanc did not discuss the possibility of stabilizing the currency value, but requested military aid to China so that it could defeat the communists.

Post Comments on Marshall's Testimony

Yalta Conference Was a Grave Mistake

[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] Regarding Marshall's statement to the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday that he was not aware in advance of the concessions made to the Soviet Union on the Northeast issue at the Yalta Conference, the Washington Post recently criticized the Yalta Conference as a "grave mistake."

It stated that the late President Roosevelt paid a considerable price to induce the Soviet Union to join the Pacific War, and that "under the current circumstances where the Soviet Union and China do not cooperate, this price weighs heavily on the conscience of the American people. The Soviet Union, through the Yalta Agreement, sought to make the Northeast a Soviet colony, disregarding China's rights. The Soviet Union, in President Chiang's current predicament, has only expressed its friendship and support for President Chiang through silence and inaction." The newspaper quoted an unnamed authoritative source as saying that Marshall told the late President Roosevelt at Yalta that Japan could surrender within six months after the collapse of Germany, and stated: "There are few mistakes in this war greater than Yalta."

Star Asks Marshall to

Clarify Stance on Nationalists and Communists

[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st] A Washington Star editorial asked US Secretary of State Marshall to clarify the US stance on the relationship between the Chinese Nationalists and Communists. The newspaper stated that President Wu's message to Congress regarding aid to China has failed to quell the controversy in the United States over China policy. Since coalition governments of communists and other parties have proven impossible in countries around the world, has the State Department recognized this fact and changed its view? The newspaper concluded: "Since an agreement between the Chinese Nationalists and Communists is clearly impossible, what is the alternative?" These questions should be clearly explained so that Congress and the public can have guidelines.

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 21st, United Press] The San Francisco Chronicle today published an article titled "China and the 1948 Presidential Election," stating that the Republican Party is using the China issue as an attack point against the government's foreign policy, and the President is also using political advantages, but "both seem not to have thoroughly examined the China issue, which is truly unsatisfactory." The American people, who are more concerned with world peace than with who will be in the White House in the next four years, should demand better performance from the responsible leaders of both parties.

### Rapid Developments in the Czech Political Situation: Washington and London Closely Monitoring; the Only Democratic Nation in Eastern Europe Faces Calamity

[Reuters, Washington, 21st] State Department officials dismissed with a laugh the Moscow radio report that US Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, Steinhardt, instructed non-communist members of the Czech cabinet to resign. US officials stated that the US government is closely monitoring the Czech political situation, with the US Embassy providing reports to the State Department at all times. Officials here are extremely concerned about recent developments in Prague. The announcement by Premier Gottwald of a foiled coup plot, his ousting of non-communist cabinet members, and the arrival of a Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister in Prague, indicate that Czechoslovakia, the only country in Eastern Europe not yet under full communist control, will inevitably face the same fate as other small Eastern European nations. The maintenance of Czech political integrity and independence is considered more important here than that of other Eastern European countries. The reasons are as follows: Firstly, the United States and Czechoslovakia have a traditionally close relationship. The foundation of the Czechoslovak Republic was laid during World War I with the assistance of then-US President Wilson, by the first Czech President Masaryk (father of the current Czech Foreign Minister) and the current Czech President Beneš, who were based in the United States. Therefore, a successful communist coup in Czechoslovakia would likely evoke a sharper reaction in the US than developments in other Eastern European countries. Secondly, Czechoslovakia has always been seen as a bridge between Eastern and Western Europe, especially regarding the Marshall Plan. Although Czechoslovakia was forced by Soviet intervention to withdraw from the Marshall Plan, it is hoped here that trade between Czechoslovakia and countries participating in the plan can play an important role in supplementing the effects of the aid plan. Finally, it is believed here that the relationship between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, at least in theory, can be a test of the Soviet claim that "the goal of its foreign policy is solely to ensure that neighboring countries are friendly to the Soviet Union for security reasons." In fact, Czechoslovakia has consistently supported the Soviet government's views in international conferences, and its political and economic ties with the Soviet Union are sufficient to demonstrate its friendship. Therefore, recent developments in Czechoslovakia may reveal the true goals of the Soviet Union's proclaimed foreign policy.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st] Developments in the Czech political situation are causing considerable concern here. Observers say that the Czech government is the last bastion of Western European democratic and liberal ideals. The communists want to destroy it to establish a political system similar to those in Eastern European countries, in accordance with Soviet demands. This offensive has been brewing for some time but had not yet reached fruition. The sudden outbreak is due to Moscow's great alarm at the strengthening of Western European unity, believing that the opportunity must not be lost to prevent Western European countries from negotiating on the German question. Non-communist cabinet members will still launch a major counterattack, but it is widely believed that communist Premier Gottwald will propose a reorganization of the government with the communists and left-wing social democrats as the main players. The communist strategy in Czechoslovakia is to win the sympathy of the Social Democrats, which should not be difficult, as the communist efforts in the past two months have already won the support of the working class.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st] The Foreign Office has just received a report from the British Embassy in Czechoslovakia regarding the Czech coup. The Foreign Office has also received copies of the resolution on the German question issued after the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia in Prague, as well as the Soviet-Hungarian treaty. All three documents have been forwarded to Foreign Secretary Bevin for further study.

### Czech President Tries to Avert Cabinet Crisis: Urges All Parties to Work Together and Continue Cooperation; Communist Party's Attitude is Firm and Determined to Fulfill Demands

[Reuters, Prague, 21st] Czech workers held a mass rally in the square outside Prague's Old City Hall. After listening to a speech by communist Premier Gottwald, they passed a resolution demanding that President Beneš accept the resignation of the twelve non-communist cabinet members and form a "Gottwald government without reactionary cabinet members." The rally then dispatched a delegation to meet with President Beneš, who assured them that the new government formed after this political crisis would still be led by Gottwald. He also stated that the new government would be a government under a parliamentary system, and not a non-partisan transitional government. No party, whether communist or any other party in parliament, would be excluded. Beneš also called on all parties to work together and cooperate during this difficult time.

After giving a speech at the mass rally, (the content of which was reported yesterday) Premier Gottwald, accompanied by Interior Minister Nosek, met with Beneš. Beneš later met with three leaders of the Social Democratic Party: Deputy Premier Fierlinger, Party Chairman Lausman, and Secretary-General Vilím. Beneš then left Prague for his Lana villa, 55 kilometers northwest, for the weekend. There is no hope of resolving the cabinet crisis before his return. The Communist Party has convened a meeting of 8,000 representatives of the National Trade Union Council to be held here on Sunday for further demonstrations.

[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 22nd] Trade unions and communists belonging to the Czech Communist Party convened a congress of representatives of the Trade Union Council in the Czech capital today, deciding to hold a one-hour strike next Tuesday to warn the government and implement their demands.

[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 21st] All bridges of compromise between President Beneš and the Communist Party now seem to be completely broken. Communist leader Gottwald, while convening what he called "the greatest parliament of Czechoslovakia," a national meeting of labor council representatives, delivered a fierce and threatening speech, demanding the immediate formation of a new government, excluding all right-wing and centrist parties. The uncompromising attitude of the communist leader has rendered all attempts at mediation and understanding ineffective. Although Gottwald did not explicitly mention the president's name in his speech, his words were clearly addressed to Beneš.

### Czech Communists Demand Formation of an All-Communist Cabinet

[Reuters, Prague, 21st] The Czech Communist Party, led by Premier Gottwald, today demanded that President Beneš accept the resignations of the twelve non-communist cabinet members in the coalition cabinet. In the name of the Presidium of the Czech Communist Party, signed by Chairman Gottwald and Secretary-General Slánský, a letter was submitted to President Beneš, stating that according to public opinion, constitutional provisions, and democratic practice, the President should immediately initiate negotiations to fill the vacancies caused by the resignations. The letter also expressed the belief that the Social Democrats would certainly continue to participate in the government with the Communist Party. The letter further requested that President Beneš accept public opinion and agree to the Communist Party's demands to promote a happier development of the Czechoslovak People's Republic. In another letter to the Executive Committee of the Social Democratic Party, the Communist leaders argued that the current crisis could be resolved jointly by the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party, and that both parties have a responsibility to ensure the peaceful development of the Republic and promote socialist development. The letter also pointed out that accepting the resignations of the non-communist cabinet members is the only way to resolve the crisis.

### London Conference Opens Today: France May Participate in the Full Merger of West German Zones; US Resolutely Rejects Soviet Protest

[Reuters, Paris, 21st] French Prime Minister's Office Secretary-General, Minister of State Apel, revealed to reporters after today's cabinet meeting that France may participate in the merger of the three occupied zones of Germany if it receives satisfactory conditions. The cabinet meeting's communique stated that the cabinet has approved the instructions drafted by Foreign Minister Bidault for the French delegation to the London Big Three Conference. Apel also said that the French delegation would pay particular attention to the discussions on the international control of the Ruhr and the German political structure. France favors the establishment of a federal state in Germany, but is not completely opposed to the reunification of Germany.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] In a note delivered to the Soviet Ambassador to the United States on the 21st, US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett emphasized that the Soviet government's actions have made it necessary for the US, Britain, and France to convene a conference in London on the German question. Lovett stated that since the Soviet government has failed to comply with the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement to establish a unified German economic organization, the other three powers must consult on the reorganization of the German economy for the benefit of the German and European people. Lovett claimed that the Soviet protest could only be interpreted as the Soviet government shirking its responsibility for Germany's current division. Lovett concluded that the United States still hopes that the Soviet Union will participate in the Four Power Conference to find a way to unify Germany.

### Japanese Newspapers Mostly Criticize Ashida After His Election as New Prime Minister: Accuse Him of Engaging in "Black Market Deals" with the Socialist Party

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] According to commentaries and news reports carried in major Tokyo newspapers today, Ashida is beginning his duties as Prime Minister amidst widespread criticism from the press and labor circles. The editorial of the "Yomiuri Shimbun" launched a particularly fierce attack, entitled "The Most Hideous Thing Under Heaven," criticizing Ashida for engaging in "black market deals" with left-wing members of the Social Democratic Party to seek their support for his nomination as Prime Minister. The article stated: The failure of the Katayama cabinet was due to the opposition of left-wing members to the Democratic Party's policies. Now, they have turned around and supported Ashida, which indicates their lack of responsibility and political integrity. Conversely, Ashida has also made successive concessions to the left-wing members whom he had denounced bitterly two weeks ago. The article strongly criticized the Ashida cabinet and expressed absolute opposition. Although the "Asahi Shimbun" was not as harsh as the "Yomiuri," it also expressed regret that power was not transferred to the opposition party, which it deemed a violation of the constitution. The newspaper stated that the establishment of the Ashida cabinet was based solely on policy agreements between the government parties. The "Mainichi Shimbun" published an article advising Ashida to strictly adhere to these policies, stating that his nomination did not receive the support and understanding of the Japanese people. The "Jiji Shinpo" and "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" also criticized the Democratic Party for violating the constitution and compromising with socialist policies. In addition to these criticisms unfavorable to Ashida, it was also believed that since Ashida was a member of the previous Katayama cabinet, he could continue Katayama's work, preventing a sudden interruption of government work as would have occurred if the Liberal Party had succeeded in nominating a prime minister. At a time when the national economic situation is precarious, maintaining the continuity of the government in general can avoid other chaotic situations.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] After the failure of the Liberal Party in the prime ministerial nomination election, it immediately convened successive meetings of its members to discuss how to deal with the Ashida cabinet as an opposition party in the Diet in the future. At the same time, it also decided to continue the movement for a new conservative party, regardless of MacArthur's opposition. General political observers believe that although Ashida has obtained the position of Prime Minister, his cabinet formation process still faces considerable difficulties. Yoshida, who failed in this election, has about the same strength as Ashida in the House of Representatives, but surpasses Ashida in the House of Councillors. If Mr. Yoshida can revitalize the spirit of the opposition party, the Ashida cabinet will not only have to be cautious in its policies, but he will still have great prospects on the political stage in the future.

### Hashimoto Kingoro Once Created the Northeast Incident

The International Tribunal Has Filed Charges

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] Hashimoto Kingoro has recently been charged with creating and inciting fascist-like incidents to expand Japan's invasion routes.

The evidence indicates that before the "Manchurian Incident," he strongly advocated taking "active action," and later he incited the incident.

### Security Council Prepares to Break the Deadlock Between the Netherlands and Indonesia

Will Authorize the Mediation Committee to Resolve the Dispute

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 21st] The United Nations Security Council appears likely to authorize the Three-Nation Committee to continue mediating the Dutch-Indonesian dispute, with a view to reaching a final solution, despite Soviet opposition. The Soviet Union and Ukraine have both attacked colonial powers, claiming that these powers are now forcing the Indonesian Republic to accept unilateral mediation agreements in order to achieve their imperialist goals. But although the Soviet Union has attacked the Three-Nation Arbitration Committee composed of the US, Belgium, and Australia, it does not intend to use its veto power.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 21st] The Indonesian Republic has reiterated its request to strengthen the powers of the United Nations Arbitration Committee. The Indonesian representative told the Security Council that the Netherlands' activities since signing the Renville Agreement have still caused unrest. He also attacked the Netherlands for establishing new native states in East Java against the wishes of the local people. He then thanked the representatives of China and India for sympathizing with the Indonesian viewpoint as spokesmen for the two major Asian powers. He emphasized that China strongly supported the strengthening of the powers of the Three-Nation Arbitration Committee. He warned that if the committee's powers could not be strengthened, both sides might not comply with the agreement. The Colombian representative stated that he might suggest that the Security Council should take direct responsibility for the Indonesian dispute.

### Khuang Aphaiwong Nominated as New Siamese Prime Minister

### Pakistan Withdraws from the Sterling Area

[United Press, London, 21st] The British Treasury announced that Palestine will no longer be part of the sterling area from midnight on the 21st, and its remaining sterling balances will be temporarily frozen. This measure is in preparation for the abandonment of the mandate on May 15, but will ensure that the Holy Land has sufficient funds to operate before the mandate ends. The Palestinian pound is linked to sterling, and Transjordan also uses the Palestinian currency, so it will be temporarily excluded from the sterling area. However, Transjordan has notified the British government that it intends to enact legislation to rejoin the sterling area.

Turning Minor Matters into Major Matters and Major Matters into Minor Matters

Following the Pearl Harbor incident, our informal relations with General de Gaulle deteriorated due to the unreasonable action of the Free French forces, under his command, to forcibly occupy the French islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon near the coast of Newfoundland. The incident occurred on Christmas night while the President was entertaining Prime Minister Churchill at the White House.

These islands were originally under the administration of Governor Robert of Martinique. We had reached an agreement with Governor Robert, and therefore we insisted on maintaining the status quo of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and our insistence was guaranteed. This agreement was renewed several days after the Pearl Harbor incident. In November and December, we also held negotiations with Canada regarding a powerful radio station on Saint Pierre Island, because both Canada and we were deeply concerned that it could guide the activities of German submarines. We agreed that Canada should send telegraphers to monitor the messages sent by the radio station, and if the local governor refused to acknowledge this Canadian action, we would act in concert with Canada to apply economic pressure on the two islands.

On December 4, the Canadian government informed us of a suggestion from the British government that these two islands should be occupied by Free French forces. This suggestion was deemed undesirable by both Canada and ourselves.

At the end of November, De Gaulle sent his "Minister of the Navy," Muselier, to inspect the Free French light fleet operating with the British near the coast of Newfoundland and to try to involve Miquelon Island in his actions. Muselier went to Ottawa to seek the opinion of the Canadian government. The Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs did not grant permission.

On December 15, the British Foreign Office stated that Prime Minister Churchill believed it was better for Free French forces to land and control the radio station than for the Canadian government to take action, as the latter could create an embarrassing political situation. The Foreign Office also said that no further action would be taken without the prior permission of the United States and Canadian governments.

On the same day, Muselier went to see Moffat, our minister in Ottawa, to seek the opinion of the United States government on the issue of Free French forces landing on these islands. The President read Moffat's telegram and said that he did not approve of any policy that would allow the Free French to be involved in the Saint Pierre-Miquelon situation, and he informed Moffat by telephone.

Moffat informed Muselier of our views on December 16. Muselier told Moffat that he felt we were making a mistake, but he would accept the decision.

On December 22, Laun, the counselor of the Canadian Legation in Washington, said that he could inform us that any action by the Free French forces had been prevented.

However, at the same time, Muselier communicated with De Gaulle, who ordered him to proceed as planned.

Therefore, Admiral Muselier, without prior warning to Canada or the United States, landed a small number of troops on the two islands on Christmas night and took them over. Our consul in Saint Pierre, Paske, reported to us on December 26 that Muselier had expressed deep dissatisfaction with De Gaulle, saying that his actions were like those of a dictator. Muselier said he wanted to resign, protesting against De Gaulle's unilateral order to him without obtaining the approval of the United States and Canada. Some time later, Muselier indeed broke with De Gaulle.

On Christmas Day, with the President's approval, I issued a statement pointing out that the incident caused by three "so-called Free French ships" was "a unilateral action against the agreements made by the parties concerned, and the United States government was certainly not aware of or authorized it in any way beforehand."

Unfortunately, many influential people in the United States and abroad failed to understand the broader implications of the incident and launched fierce attacks on the State Department and me for the statement issued regarding the Free French occupation of the two islands. Rarely has such a minor action caused such intense opposition.

We were particularly attacked for the word "so-called" in the phrase "so-called Free French ships" in the statement. Those who attacked us believed that by using this word, we meant to express doubt about the existence of the Free French or to doubt that they were free. In fact, what we meant by the phrase was simply "three ships assumed to be Free French."

Using the issue of the occupation of these islands as a medium, I had a frank conversation with Prime Minister Churchill at the White House regarding our entire problem with Vichy France. The President fully agreed with my position. He was also present when I discussed the matter with Mr. Churchill, but he remained on the sidelines, allowing us to have a frank exchange.

I accused De Gaulle of being a troublemaker who hindered the work of others with meaningless actions, directly violating the will that Britain, Canada, and the United States had already expressed. I demanded that the Prime Minister persuade him to withdraw his troops from Saint Pierre and Miquelon and allow Canadians and Americans to be responsible for supervising the Saint Pierre radio station.

Mr. Churchill said that if he insisted on such a demand, his relationship with the Free French movement would be harmed.

I replied that if the Free French remained on these two islands and we did nothing, it would affect our relationship with the Vichy government. I reiterated the importance of continuing to maintain this relationship, as it allowed us to use our influence to prevent the French fleet and bases from falling into German hands and to maintain observers in Vichy France and French North and West Africa.

Mr. Churchill agreed that this relationship with Vichy was as important to Britain as it was to the United States.

I directly asked the Prime Minister if he could do anything to stop De Gaulle from continuing to attack the United States government in the radio stations and newspapers.

When Churchill doubted whether he could exercise such censorship over De Gaulle, I said that De Gaulle's opposition to our propaganda campaign was supported by British funds, and if Mr. Churchill could threaten to stop the subsidies, De Gaulle would soon be helpless.

Mr. Churchill agreed to consider the points I had raised.

Just as things were developing to this point, the Prime Minister went to Ottawa and delivered a speech on December 20, fiercely attacking Vichy and praising De Gaulle to the skies.

The day after Mr. Churchill delivered his speech, I sent the President a memorandum in which I said: "Our British friends seem to believe that all French people firmly support De Gaulle, but according to all the information I and my colleagues have obtained, about 95 percent of all French people are anti-Hitler, and of these 95 percent, more than 95 percent are not De Gaullists and will not follow him. This fact has a direct impact on our North African plans, and therefore we should not count on De Gaulle's cooperation."

Regarding this last point, the President had long decided that De Gaulle should not be included in any plans for an Anglo-American invasion of French North Africa, and he had tried his best to explain this decision to Mr. Churchill. He felt that including De Gaulle could affect the confidentiality of the plan and would automatically provoke resistance among the French in North Africa.

Churchill returned to Washington almost immediately after delivering his speech in Ottawa. On January 2, I saw him at the White House and unhesitatingly said that his remarks about Vichy and De Gaulle were "extremely irritating" and had caused profound damage to me and the State Department.

I pleaded with him, saying that since our relationship with Vichy was of great value to Britain, as it was to the United States, because he himself had repeatedly admitted this to us, if he could "say a few words" indicating that although Britain was unwilling to maintain relations with Vichy, the relationship maintained by the United States was valuable for the common purpose, it would be extremely helpful to us. Otherwise, I said, the current popular impression that the United States was appeasing Vichy in direct contradiction to British wishes would continue to spread.

The Prime Minister did not agree with this suggestion.

I then asked the President to use his personal influence on Churchill to deal with this unusual situation. But Mr. Roosevelt said he had done what he could and could do no more. The attitudes of the President and the Prime Minister were so contrary to their later attitudes, because later both of them were extremely hostile to De Gaulle and remained so.

I immediately drafted a proposed agreement that I believed could be acceptable to the United States, Britain, and Canada, and that De Gaulle could agree to the withdrawal of Free French forces from these two islands. This stipulated that the United States, Britain, and Canada would jointly supervise the two islands, neutralizing and demilitarizing them.

The President agreed to my proposed solution. We then presented it to Mr. Churchill. He indicated his acceptance, conditional on De Gaulle's agreement. At the same time, Pétain had indicated his agreement. But De Gaulle refused.

De Gaulle never agreed to our proposed agreement to resolve the dispute.

Finally, as the commotion caused by the incident gradually subsided, I felt that the wisest course of action was to put the matter aside until the end of the war. The President agreed to my suggestion, and so the matter gradually dwindled into one of history's footnotes, when at the time it had the dangerous potential to develop into an entire chapter of history.

Our relationship with De Gaulle was not improved by the incident. In the minds of the President or myself personally, there was no doubt that De Gaulle was personally responsible for violating his obligations to Britain and directly violating the will of the United States and Canada. We believed that his personal ambitions were too great and that he was not as reliable as we had previously imagined.

Regarding myself, the President's refusal to exert pressure on Mr. Churchill to clarify Anglo-American relations over the De Gaulle and Vichy issues was one of several factors that almost led me to resign as Secretary of State in January 1942. I really wanted to resign and actually wrote a note in pencil, submitting my resignation.

Perhaps it is appropriate here to summarize our policy towards Vichy. Unfortunately, this policy aroused so much emotional agitation in the United States that even today, some people still believe that it was worthless, just a most tragic piece of darkness. Among these people, some seem like certain readers of history who always pay attention to the dramatic figures on horseback, blindly following them, seeing no faults in them, and treating all those who refuse to recognize their authority as deadly enemies. Strangely, many British and Americans regard De Gaulle as Joan of Arc, supporting him even more enthusiastically than most French people who follow him.

The first point is that President Roosevelt and I held the same views on both Vichy and De Gaulle.

The second point is that Prime Minister Churchill also firmly supported the maintenance of relations with Vichy, as advocated by the President and myself. Sometimes Eden did so as well, even though they themselves criticized Vichy, making it difficult to maintain relations.

The third point is that our relationship with Vichy gave us tangible benefits, namely, maintaining contact in Vichy France and French North Africa. If we had broken off relations with Vichy, this contact would have been completely severed.

In addition, it also allowed our representatives to remain in the area and try to convince France that no matter how long the war lasted, the Allies would win, and Vichy France should not cooperate with Germany. At the same time, it was possible to keep the French people's fundamental concept of freedom alive in their minds and hope that France's free system would be restored. Furthermore, it played a role in preventing the transfer of bases and materials to Germany in May 1941. This relationship also had an impact on preventing the French fleet from falling into German hands.

The fourth point is that if we had completely broken off relations with Vichy or forced Pétain into Hitler's arms, we would not have been able to find a prominent French leader with whom we could have a relationship. Diplomatically recognizing De Gaulle completely was equivalent to diplomatically no longer recognizing Vichy. The disadvantages to us clearly outweighed the advantages. But we did indeed go so far as to provide De Gaulle with military assistance, trying to make him a military leader and general of the French army, as he should have been, and hoping that he would later separate himself from political relations and focus solely on fighting the Germans on the battlefield.

The fifth point, and the most important, is that our relationship with Vichy allowed us to have consuls in North Africa, which paved the way and left room for planning and dispatching Anglo-American expeditionary forces to the western Mediterranean and for assisting British forces in their activities east of that region.

### On the Eve of the Assembly Meeting, Receptions Held to Solicit Opinions from Various Districts, Half of the 217 Senators Have Already Registered, Mayor's Report on Governance to Open This Morning

[Reported by this newspaper] The fifth plenary session of the first Shanghai Municipal Council will officially open at 9:00 AM today in the assembly hall of the council on Tanggu Road. The first meeting will be held from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, where Mayor Wu will report on governance. There will be a recess in the afternoon. The second meeting will be held tomorrow afternoon from 2:00 PM, featuring work reports from the directors of the Finance, Education, and Land Administration Bureaus, as well as inquiries from the senators regarding finance, education, and land administration, and the directors' responses. As of yesterday, 118 senators had registered, and it is expected that more will attend today. Senators from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties are participating in this meeting, totaling 217 people. The seating arrangement for the senators will be re-determined by drawing lots. The secretariat of the council has received 41 proposals as of yesterday. The municipal government's report on governance has also been submitted to the council.

Council Speaker Pan and Deputy Speaker Xu of the Municipal Council believe that the district chiefs and chairmen of the district people's representative assemblies in various districts of the city are all representatives of the people. However, due to time constraints during council meetings, they do not have the opportunity to express their opinions one by one. Therefore, a reception was specially arranged on the eve of the meeting, at 3:00 PM yesterday, to invite the district chiefs and chairmen of the representative assemblies to solicit their opinions, so as to submit them to the general assembly for discussion. In addition, the council has also scheduled the fourth meeting on the 26th to invite representatives elected by the district chiefs and representative assemblies to attend the general assembly and report. In addition to the district chiefs and people's representatives, those who attended yesterday's tea party included Municipal Council members, Secretary-General Zonglian Shen representing Mayor Wu, and directors of various bureaus, totaling about 80 people.

Council Speaker Pan presided over the reception and stated in his speech that this year is the year of constitutional governance for the country. However, due to the rebellion of the communist bandits, it is necessary to first suppress the rebellion. Superficially, suppressing the rebellion is a military matter and seems incompatible with the implementation of constitutional governance. However, in fact, to implement constitutional governance, the communist bandits cannot be allowed to rebel, so it is necessary to suppress the rebellion, which is actually the work of the people. How to advance local autonomy from political tutelage to constitutional governance is something that representatives of the people should discuss as much as possible, putting aside personal relationships and thinking for the citizens, and then submit your opinions to the general assembly of the council for discussion.

Secretary-General Shen then stated in his speech that implementing democracy requires respecting public opinion. In the future, local handling of conscription, allocation of food, etc., will increase the workload in various districts, and implementation may be difficult. It is hoped that the district chiefs and people's representatives will raise these issues, so that the municipal government can understand and promote the improvement of municipal administration.

Opinions Expressed One After Another

Subsequently, the chairmen of the district people's representative assemblies and the district chiefs spoke one after another. The chairman of the Xincheng District People's Representative Assembly stated that based on past student movements, dance bans, labor strikes, and other events, there may be communist elements causing trouble, but considering the actual situation, it can be seen that the central government's consideration of the implementation of laws and regulations may not be thorough enough, resulting in such consequences. Therefore, it is hoped that in the future, before implementing laws and regulations, the central government should first seek the opinion of the council. The chairman of the Yangshupu District People's Representative Assembly requested three points: (1) The Municipal Council had previously approved the establishment of municipal primary and secondary schools in the district, but they have not yet been established. It is hoped that they can be implemented soon. (2) The rear hospital No. 25 is located in this district, and local thugs often exploit the wounded soldiers and commit all kinds of evil deeds. It is requested that the municipal government find a way to relocate the hospital. (3) The branch roads in the district from south to north are extremely dirty and unsightly. It is hoped that they can be improved. A representative from Pudong District, seeing newspaper reports that household registration will be handled by the police bureau, believed it was inappropriate and requested the council to explain the reasons to the Executive Yuan so that it would still be handled by the district office.

Dissatisfaction with Rent Standards

A representative from the Laozha District expressed dissatisfaction with the rent standards passed by the municipal administration meeting, saying that the municipal government's investigation that rents on Nanjing Road were 30,000 or 40,000 times higher than before was inaccurate. According to the actual investigation of general household rents by the district people's representative assembly, the maximum was less than 10,000 times. That is, the previous dispute in the district caused by Hartung's unreasonable rent adjustment was only 3,000 to 8,000 times. The Chang Bureau should consider the interests of general households and not use large hotels, large shops, and large buildings as the standard. The district chief of Zhabei District said that the district office is often surrounded and disturbed by citizens. The government and bureaus should cooperate. Suppressing the rebellion should not only focus on military affairs, but must pay attention to whether the people cooperate. It is hoped that the people's self-defense force will be increased and the Baojia system will be strengthened. In addition, there are many refugees in Zhabei, and it is hoped that they can be provided with relief. A representative from Tilanqiao asked the authorities to think more about the poor and not make the poor bear taxes in the same way while only the rich enjoy the benefits. There is no water or electricity in some areas of the district, causing great suffering. A representative from Wusong District said that the location designated by the Land Administration Bureau for the district office is far away at Paotai Bay, more than three miles away from the town, which is extremely inconvenient. It is hoped that a portion of the public land of the God of Wealth Temple at the intersection of the Chamber of Commerce Road can be allocated. There were also those who did not have time to speak, and their opinions were submitted in writing.

Subsequently, Ren Xianqun of the Civil Food Distribution Committee attended and reported on the issue of rice distribution. (See page 7)

Finally, Deputy Speaker Xu stated in his speech that the issues discussed at this council meeting are quite numerous, such as suppressing the rebellion, conscription, public security, rent, tax increases, etc., all of which are very important. The first thing to be reported to everyone is that all cases will be resolved reasonably by the council, and those that cannot be implemented will definitely be rejected impartially. Suburban citizens receive fewer benefits because they are far away and cannot be taken care of. It is not that the municipal government favors urban citizens. It is also hoped that the municipal authorities will pay attention to both near and far in the future. The reception ended at about 5:00 PM.

### Zhao Banfu, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Takes Office Today

Zhao Lifu, advisor to the Social Affairs Bureau, has been ordered to be promoted to Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau and will take office this morning. The former Deputy Director, Jianhua Li, has been transferred to serve as a counselor to the municipal government.

### Zhang Xiaosong Intends to Retire, Feels Conscription is Difficult to Handle

[Reported by this newspaper] The municipal election office is scheduled to cease operations at the end of this month, and the staff will be transferred back to their original agencies, but the office will not be closed. Zhang Xiaosong has recently expressed his intention to retire again. According to him, this has nothing to do with the election. The main reason is that the conscription issue is difficult to handle. The district defense headquarters has telegraphed the city to hand over 1,500 draftees by the end of March. A conscription meeting will be held on the 29th of this month, where this will be discussed.

### Shi Meiyu Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing, Denies Taking Position as Presiding Judge of the Special Criminal Court

Shi Meiyu, Presiding Judge of the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals under the Ministry of National Defense, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday. According to reporters, the trial of war criminals will end between April and May. There are still more than one hundred pending cases, which are being expedited. Shi denied rumors that he will also serve as Presiding Judge of the Special Criminal Court.

### Shanghai Lixing Friendship Society Holds New Year's Party Tonight

The Shanghai Lixing Friendship Society is a friendship group organized by key figures from the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors in the city. Through a year of promotion, the number of members has increased to more than 170. In order to celebrate the Spring Festival and congratulate members Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Luo Beichen, Shui Xiangyun, and Xu Enzeng on being elected to the National Assembly, Zhang Fengzeng on being elected as an alternate delegate to the National Assembly, and Ma Shuli, Wang Genzhong, Fei Xia, and others on being elected as members of the Legislative Yuan, Wang Zhuyi and Xie Renzhao on being elected as alternate members of the Legislative Yuan, a New Year's party will be held at the Hushe at 6:00 PM today. In addition to wonderful Peking opera performances such as Dr. Mei Lanfang's son and daughter Bao Yue and Bao Jiu jointly performing "Silang Visits His Mother," and the Xiasheng Drama School performing the famous play "Baluo and" (Hong Bi Yuan), and cross-talk performances by Tu Yunfu and Jiang Shaolin, there will also be raffles and other entertainment.

### Draftees Aged 21 to be Selected First, Starting Next Month, Funding of One Hundred Billion Needed

According to reliable sources, after the city's conscription meeting is held on the 29th of this month, the conscription work will begin on the first of next month, first handling the investigation of the draftees' family backgrounds, and then proceeding with the procedures of registering and reviewing, etc. It is expected that 6,000 draftees will be recruited by the end of June. This time, a lottery method will be used. The age of the qualified draftees will be from 21 to 24. The lottery will be drawn from those aged 21 first. If the number of 6,000 is reached, no more 22-year-old draftees will be drawn. Otherwise, those aged 22 and above will be drawn year by year until the quota is filled. The problem now is the conscription funds, because the total expenditure last year was 12 billion. This year, the estimated cost for each draftee, such as uniforms, food and lodging, welfare, and family support, will reach more than 10 million. Then the number of 6,000 will reach 100 billion. This is indeed a huge figure, and Changju is working hard to raise funds for this.

### Deadline for Demolition on Tianmu Road Expires Again: Residents Reiterate Previous Request to Avoid Demolition, Appoint Representatives to Continue Appeals to Authorities

[Our Newspaper News] The Tianmu Road demolition incident caused a sensation last year. At that time, due to repeated appeals from local residents, Mayor Wu personally inspected the area and approved a temporary postponement of the demolition until after the Spring Festival. Now that the deadline has expired again, residents, facing the current housing shortage, feel unable to relocate. Therefore, they earnestly request that the authorities exempt them from demolition. Recently, they have again appointed representatives to continue appealing to various government agencies, including the Municipal Government and the Municipal Council. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, they hosted the press to issue a public statement, stating that Tianmu Road (formerly Jielu Road) is a combination of Old Xinmin Road and Tianmu Road, with a width of more than 60 feet, which is two to three times the width of Zhejiang North Road and Henan South Road. Usually, vehicles and pedestrians move freely, a world apart from the traffic congestion and chaos on Nanjing Road, Jiangxi Road, and Fujian Road. Furthermore, the north side of Tianmu Road was widened by 28 feet in March of the 36th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1947], leaving ample space. Therefore, no matter which train arrives at the North Station, there is absolutely no crowding of vehicles or pedestrians, as seen by officials and travelers to and from Beijing and Shanghai. If the purpose of demolition and road widening is merely to improve the appearance of the city and seek grandeur, then all the buildings on Tianmu Road, whether newly built or old, are above average and do not obstruct the view. If the municipal authorities truly have the determination and concrete plans to improve urban traffic, they should prioritize widening congested areas first, making the widening of Tianmu Road unnecessary (point one). Moreover, the houses on Tianmu Road are densely packed, and the residents rely on them for their livelihoods and businesses. Once the houses are destroyed, they will have nowhere to live and will face the hardship of relocation. Shops and factories will close, leading to unemployment. School children will be unable to transfer schools, resulting in interrupted education. All of these factors will increase social unrest (point two). Furthermore, due to the Communist bandits harming the country, the Central Government has issued a clear order for mobilization to suppress the rebellion and to simplify the suppression, which is promulgated nationwide. Unless it is a construction project that is essential for people's livelihood and unavoidable, all projects should be stopped. Now, the residential shops on Tianmu Road number in the hundreds, including many high-rise buildings worth hundreds of millions. Once demolished, the losses will be enormous. The residents will be swept away by the flood, and the municipal authorities will not only waste the national treasury but also violate the national policy of saving resources for the suppression of the rebellion (point three), and so on.

### Chairman Pan Submits a Motion Requesting the Central Government to Clearly Define the Organization of the Shanghai Municipal Bank

[Our Newspaper News] Yesterday, the Municipal Council received more than ten motions, including: (1) A motion submitted by Chairman Pan, the content of which is to request the Central Government to clearly define the organization of the Shanghai Municipal Bank. If it is a joint public-private venture, it should be a joint stock venture in accordance with the law. If it belongs to the provincial bank organization, it must also be supervised by representatives from local public opinion organs in accordance with the law. However, the current organization of the Municipal Bank, although publicly run, has not been handled according to regulations. (2) A motion submitted by Zhang Zhihan: "Please severely punish the masterminds who instigated thugs to destroy the Social Bureau, release the innocent, and withdraw the prohibition on dancing to promote the rule of law and ensure the well-being of the people." (3) A motion submitted by Yu Rupin: "When telephone subscribers apply to the city telephone company for additional extensions, they often delay or ignore the requests, resulting in longer call times and inconvenience to users." (4) Another motion: "Please request the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau to set up public telephones in Zhabei and the four suburbs to benefit the citizens and improve public safety." (5) A motion submitted by Wang Weiqin: "Please ask the government to use real estate as collateral for bank loans to revitalize land finance in the city and alleviate the housing shortage." (6) A motion submitted by Qian Songping: "Please stop armed personnel from extorting money under the guise of investigating building permits in the suburbs." (7) A motion submitted by Rong Hongsan: "Suggest that the Central Government's new plan for local administrative facilities should be submitted to public opinion organs for review and approval before implementation to ensure prudence, and that powers should be unified to increase administrative efficiency." (8) A motion submitted by Chen Peide: "Please stipulate the time for dumping manure to emphasize hygiene, and please stipulate the daily fee to avoid disturbing citizens." (9) A motion submitted by Zhang Zhongyuan: "Please expedite the construction of the art museum on the land dedicated for that purpose."

### Seeking Welfare for Tenants: Organizing a Tenants' Union

Since the municipal government meeting passed the method of calculating rent according to index standards, all tenants in the city believe that this method is obviously biased because the municipal government meeting only has representatives from the real estate industry and no representatives from the tenants' association. They have jointly launched the establishment of the Shanghai City Tenants' Union and submitted a request to the Social Department and the Social Bureau to approve the organization of the Jiangsu Provincial Tenants' Union as a precedent in order to seek welfare for all tenants in the city on a regular basis. The initiators of the organization of the union include the Nanjing Road Business Federation and the Tenant Joint Office of the British firm Arnhold & Co., Ltd., the Yuxingli Tenants' Association, and the Cihou Northli Tenants' Association, etc., more than ten organizations.

### Fellow Townsmen of Songjiang in Shanghai Held a Dinner Yesterday Afternoon

Finally, Zhang Zenghui, who will soon study engineering abroad, expressed his farewell wishes. Everyone gathered together and parted happily.

### Lake Society Holds Spring Tea Party, Welcoming Fellow Townsmen to Participate

The cost of the meal is 200,000 yuan per person, and reservations are required in advance. All fellow townsmen, regardless of gender, are welcome to participate.

### New Year's Garbage Cleared Yesterday

Flying Squads Organized for Scheduled Operations

The amount of garbage in the city increased sharply during the Lunar New Year, increasing by 500 to 800 tons per day. Usually, there are only 2,400 to 2,500 tons, but during the New Year, there was an average of 2,900 tons per day. On the fifth day of the New Year, it reached 3,600 tons. Due to the heavy fog a few days ago, the barge was suspended, resulting in nearly 2,000 tons of garbage piled up at wharves such as Maigen Road and Xinkai River. The garbage was not cleared until yesterday.

The Cleaning Corps of the Health Bureau has set up two dedicated telephone lines, 19923 and 13635, to facilitate citizens' requests for garbage removal. It has also newly repaired four trucks to form two flying squads. Two squad leaders, sixteen garbage collectors, and two drivers were transferred from the original organization. Each car is equipped with four efficient garbage collectors and one squad leader. One squad is stationed at the main workshop on Jianguo East Road, and the other is stationed at the sixth squadron's vehicle park on Sha Jing Road in Hongkou. It is planned to establish and dispatch them from March 1st.

### Traveler at Dafang Hotel Attempts Suicide

### Hoping to Promote the Spirit of the Northwest Nationalities, Preparing to Build a New Gansu: Guo Jiqiao Urges Fellow Students from Shanghai to Work Together

The Gansu Alumni Association in Shanghai held a tea party at the Fudan Teahouse of Fudan University yesterday to welcome Guo Jiqiao, Chairman of Gansu Province. More than 200 people attended. The meeting was first welcomed by Mao Hongpan, chairman of the conference, followed by Guo's speech, the main points being: 1. The Northwest is the birthplace of Chinese national culture. The reasons for its backwardness are: (1) The scourge of feudal thinking, (2) The people themselves do not seek progress. 2. The Northwest has an important position. Our current urgent tasks are two, namely (1) to seek progress in unity, to truly do everything for the country, everything for the people, and to eliminate selfish and self-interested viewpoints, (2) to find a way out of difficulties. Gansu is poor and financially distressed. Last year, more than 92% of the annual expenditure was subsidized by the central government. Although the environment is difficult, we are now working hard to overcome the difficulties and develop economic proposals. For example, the original industrial and mining construction projects cooperated by the central and provincial governments are now being taken over by the provincial government to strive for development, and transportation and water conservancy construction are the most urgent needs for the construction of the Northwest. 3. The three main points of Gansu Province's administration include: (1) Integration of peacetime and wartime, (2) Layered responsibility, (3) Strengthening local self-defense forces. Guo also put forward the four major construction centers in the Northwest: (1) Self-defense (2) Production, (3) Culture, (4) Health. Finally, he put forward two hopes for the students in Shanghai: first, to promote the spirit of hard work, frugality, and hard work of the Northwest nationalities. Second, pay close attention to technical studies, and prepare to return home to serve and build a new home and a new Gansu. The speech was followed by a photo session and the meeting was adjourned. Guo visited Song Ziwen, Chairman of Guangdong Province, yesterday to exchange views on local provincial administration and had a pleasant conversation. He then left. Guo was originally scheduled to go to Beijing by night train last night to report on his duties, but it has been changed to tonight due to circumstances.

### Newly Created Motorized Tricycle: Beautiful Design, Convenient Driving, Travels at 35 Miles per Hour

In this city, the government's austerity order is being implemented, so the issuance of car licenses and the distribution of gasoline are strictly restricted. Western tricycles violate humanity and obstruct the city's appearance, so they are also being eliminated. However, in this metropolis of millions, under these circumstances, the seriousness of the transportation problem will increase day by day. It is learned that Wang Errong Hua Kun brothers and Ji Lianfu of Litong Automobile Co., Ltd. on Nanchang Road in this city have created a kind of motorized tricycle, which is roughly similar to an ordinary tricycle, but the chassis is lower and the style is better. (The picture shows the speed reaching 35 miles per hour, and each gallon of gasoline can travel 75 miles. Driving is extremely easy, and it only takes five minutes to learn. Management is also very simple, and the selling price is only about twice as high as ordinary tricycles, which is not a huge expense. The oil consumption is extremely low, which does not conflict with the austerity order. At the same time, driving is convenient, no manpower is required, and the style is beautiful. It is heard that Litong Automobile Co., Ltd. believes that this motorized tricycle can solve a part of Shanghai's traffic problems, so it will submit a request to the Municipal Council for discussion at the conference, hoping to promote it. At the same time, according to the Wang brothers, ordinary tricycles can also be modified. The first batch of products has been completely ordered by Taiwanese customers for use. If the authorities in this city approve, this new type of vehicle will also be seen driving on the streets of this city.

### Charity Sale of Houses Progresses Smoothly: Expected to be Completed by the End of April as Scheduled, Alley Names Planned to Use "義" (yi - Righteousness)

[Our Newspaper News] The Charity House Building Department and Purchasing Group of the Winter Relief Committee held a meeting at the Public Works Bureau of the Municipal Government a few days ago, presided over by Zhao Jikang, Director of the Public Works Bureau, to report on the progress of the project and discuss ways to supply building materials on schedule. According to Director Zhao, after the meeting, the house building project is progressing very smoothly and is expected to be completed by the end of April as scheduled. The Charity Houses are divided into five sites, building five alleys. Watchman's residences will be added at the entrances of each alley. For the sake of prudence, a wall will be built around the alleys and decorated with exquisite door plaques. In order to commemorate the Charity Houses, the names of the alleys will begin with the character "義" (yi - Righteousness). In order to promote our country's ancient moral principles of "loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace," the alleys are planned to be named "Yi Zhong New Village," "Yi Xiao New Village," "Yi Ren New Village," "Yi Ai New Village," etc. However, the official naming of the New Villages is planned to be presided over by Mayor Wu. In order to supervise that all projects are implemented strictly according to the drawings, a supervision team has been formed, with representatives from five groups: the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Social Bureau, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the General Labor Union, who will take turns inspecting the construction during the construction period.

Estimated Value: Expected to be 3 Billion

According to Director Zhao's careful estimate, the cost of a Class B house is about 700 million yuan, and a Class A house is 1 billion yuan. However, once completed in the future, the estimated value can reach 3 billion yuan. This is because the land for the Charity Houses is loaned interest-free by the National Bank, the building materials are supplied by the Winter Relief Committee, and the various construction industries undertake the project at the lowest labor price. In the future, when building raw materials rise and the cost of living increases sharply, the price of the houses will inevitably increase several times compared to the cost. Therefore, Director Zhao firmly believes that the Charity House lottery tickets will be sold out before the lottery draw in early March.

Construction Progress: Invitation to Visit

[Another Report] The Charity House Lottery Department of the Winter Relief Committee has determined that the lottery ceremony for the Class B tickets (i.e., those priced at 100,000 yuan each) will be held at the Municipal Gymnasium next Monday afternoon. The lottery method will still follow the original regulations, using three balls for the draw, which will be absolutely public. As for the Class A tickets (i.e., those priced at 200,000 yuan each), because they have not all been sold, the date of the lottery draw for the Class A tickets will be announced again when the Class B tickets are drawn on the first day of next month, but there will be no long delay.

In order to allow all sectors of society to understand the construction of the Charity Houses, the association has specifically designated 11:00 AM tomorrow to invite reporters from various newspapers to visit the construction project at 1503 West Zhongzheng Road to inspect the construction project. Mayor Wu will also go there at that time and make a report.

### Supervisory Committee Member He Postpones Return to Beijing to Collect Election Case Information

[Our Newspaper News] Supervisory Committee member He Hanwen came to Shanghai to investigate the election fraud of the Legislative Yuan and is currently actively collecting information. The day before yesterday, he also visited President Guo of the High Court for discussions. According to He, the situation is complicated, and he has decided to postpone his return to Beijing.

### Regulations for the Custody of Traitor Houses to be Implemented by Order of the Enemy Property Office

Regarding the regulations for the custody and use of traitor houses, the Enemy and Pseudo-Property Clearing Office has recently been ordered by the Executive Yuan to implement the following: Article 1: After a traitor's house has been sealed up in accordance with the law, before it is sold, a public agency may apply to the Executive Yuan for approval to take custody of it for use. Article 2: A public agency that has taken custody of a traitor's house for use shall exercise the same care as it would in managing its own affairs. In addition to bearing the cost of repairs itself, it shall pay a monthly usage fee. Article 3: A public agency that has taken custody of a traitor's house for use shall not alter its original condition or add any buildings. Article 4: A public agency that has taken custody of a traitor's house for use shall not transfer it without the approval of the Executive Yuan. Any unauthorized transfer shall result in the termination of the agency's custody and use, and the Yuan shall dispose of the house in another way. Article 5: The handover and charging of fees for the custody and use of traitor houses shall be handled by the local enemy and pseudo-property handling agencies. Article 6: After a judgment confiscating a traitor's house has been finalized, the house shall be sold by auction in principle. The agency that has taken custody of the house for use shall not be allowed to purchase the house directly without the approval of the Executive Yuan. Article 7: If a judgment determines that a traitor's house should be returned, the custody and use shall be terminated immediately and the property shall be returned to the owner.

### Youth Detained for Patronizing Prostitutes

[Our Newspaper News] Pan Songlin, a youth from Yongji, is 26 years old and lives at 17 Wenyuanfang, South Tibet Road. He is fond of women and often frequents prostitutes outside. Recently, he often does not return home at night. His wife, Xie Meiyue, probed in various ways and learned that Pan had a passionate affair with Cai Sibao, a prostitute from the Cai Sibao brothel at 65 Lane 3, Shantou Road (known as one of the "Four Little King Kongs" in the flower world). They often rented hotels for secret meetings. The night before, she learned that Pan had gone with Cai to the Jielu Hotel on Tibet Road and opened room 467. She did not move, but secretly reported to the Laozha Police Station at midnight. The police rushed to the scene and arrested the pair of illicit lovers and brought them to the police station, where they confessed to adultery without hesitation. It is reported that relatives and friends have come forward to mediate, and it is unlikely that they will go to court.

### Public Utility Bureau Considers Adjustment of Public Utility Prices Reasonable

Since the implementation of the automatic adjustment formula for public utility prices, the prices of various public utilities in the city have been adjusted monthly. It is heard that some councilors will propose at the upcoming Municipal Council meeting to request the central government to cancel the automatic adjustment formula. The reporter asked Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utility Bureau, for his opinion on this. According to him, the adoption of the automatic adjustment formula for public utilities is in accordance with the central government's orders, so that the major public utility companies will not face suspension due to excessive losses. The increase in the price of coal, gasoline, and the increase in foreign exchange rates are the main factors that have led to the increase in the prices of public utilities. The impact on the cost of living is still small. The central government used to adopt a subsidy policy for public utilities, but currently the central government cannot afford this subsidy, so the only reasonable way is to apply the automatic adjustment method.

### Iron Block Explosion Injures Squatter

[Our Newspaper News] Jiang Guozhu, a squatter in the Sun Temple squatter area in Zhabei, was injured in his left hand and head by an explosion at about 5:50 p.m. yesterday when he was hammering an old iron block. He was taken to the Pingmin Hospital for treatment.

### Wharf Worker Exposed for Stealing Items from Haihuang Steamer on First Attempt

[Our Newspaper News] The state-run China Merchants Bureau sent a thief, Yu Jinguang, to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation the day before yesterday. On the 18th of this month, when the China Merchants Bureau's Haihuang Steamer was berthed in Jiangxin, three wharf workers stole two pulleys and tarpaulins from the steamer onto a small boat, and fled along the side of the ship. They were spotted by the inspectors on the steamer, who ordered them to stop. The wharf workers on the boat were anxious and accelerated their escape, pushing the stolen goods into the river in an attempt to destroy the evidence. Because the small boat was moving very fast, they eventually escaped. After investigation, wharf worker Yu Jinguang was suspected, arrested, and interrogated. Yu confessed to theft, saying: "I originally wanted to work on the Haihuang Steamer, but I was late and didn't get the job. Seeing them stealing items from the steamer successfully, I temporarily joined in, wanting to get a share, but I was exposed on my first attempt. As for the other two wharf workers, because they were temporary partners, I don't know their names."

### Romance on the Same Boat Leads to Elopement After Marriage

[Our Newspaper News] Wang Ruxiang of Cheng Ba, residing at 49 Meiquanli, East Taiwan Road, married Yuan Bingwang, a girl of the same village and age, through a matchmaker on December 20th last year. Unexpectedly, six days after the marriage, Bingyu eloped and did not return. Afterwards, Wang searched everywhere. It was not until 9:00 AM yesterday morning that he learned that Bingyu was hiding in the squatter area at the southern end of Dapuqiao, South Central Zhinan Road, living with Yang Zhengfan, a fellow villager. He reported the information to the Songshan Police Station, who arrested Yang and brought him to the station for interrogation. According to Bingyu, she was escorted to Shanghai by her brother Bingyao before her marriage. When she took a civilian boat, she met Yang and they fell in love at first sight. A relationship then developed. After the marriage, Yang continued to pursue her, lingering in the alley every day, inviting her out. She was moved by him and is now willing to follow Yang and become his wife, and does not want to return to Wang, etc. The police station believes that Yang is suspected of enticement and plans to hand him over to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal action.

### Traitor Zhou Bingding to be Interrogated Today: Fan Wenliu's Wife Seeks Justice for Her Husband

[Our Newspaper News] Traitor Zhou Xiaobing was originally a subordinate of Zhao Yousheng, the commander of the Second Brigade of the puppet Jiading County. He was fond of killing people. He was arrested after the victory and is currently detained at the Tilanqiao High Court Detention Center. The Special Criminal Court of the High Court is scheduled to hold a trial today. According to Fan Jinshi, the wife of the victim Fan Wenliu, she filed a complaint with the High Court, stating: "My husband, Fan Wenliu, studied poetry and books since childhood and understood the great righteousness. He served as the village chief of this village for more than ten years before the war. During the War of Resistance against Japan, he refused to take up guerrilla work and went through all kinds of hardships, which is well known to the local people. However, because the matter was not kept secret, Zhou Xiaobing, a notorious bully under Zhao Yousheng (on the run), the commander of the Second Brigade of the puppet Jiading County, who was known for killing people without blinking an eye, learned of it. On the fourth day of the first month of the lunar calendar in the 29th year of the Republic [i.e., 1940], while my husband was returning home from visiting relatives in Shanghai for the New Year, when he passed by the Tianzu Temple in Luyang Village, he was kidnapped to Maqiao without asking for any reason and shot to death immediately, and his body was thrown into the field. After I learned of it, I asked people to search everywhere. Three days later, I finally found him in the field west of Maqiao, but his clothes were stripped off, and his flesh and blood were blurred, making it difficult to recognize him. The misery of the situation is difficult to describe. Because the area was all under the control of the enemy and puppet forces at the time, there was no way to appeal. For eight years, the grievance has been suppressed until now. Recently, I learned that Zhou Xiaobing, the murderer who killed my husband, has been arrested. I am filing a complaint to pursue the truth of the crime and plead with your court to investigate."

### National Drug Trafficking Case: Two More Key Criminals Arrested in Wuxi

### National Grain Merchant Representatives Gather for the Inaugural Meeting of the Grain Association, Today's Election of Directors and Supervisors and Discussion of Proposals

[Report from this newspaper] The first general meeting of members of the National Federation of Grain Business Associations of the Republic of China officially opened yesterday (the 22nd) at 2:30 PM on the third floor of 377 Minguo Road. In attendance were the Minister of Social Affairs, the Minister of Food, Ye Shifu representing the Mayor, Lu Jing, the Deputy Minister of the Central Agricultural and Industrial Department, Chen Quan representing the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ji Mingzhai representing the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, and over a hundred other guests and member representatives, all gathered together. The opening ceremony concluded at 4:00 PM, followed by a ten-minute break, and then the first general meeting commenced, adjourning at approximately 6:00 PM.

Yesterday's membership included representatives from 18 provinces and 9 municipalities under the direct administration of the Executive Yuan, accounting for about seven-tenths of the country. Among them were four provincial federations (Zhejiang, Anhui, Sichuan, and Jiangsu), and nine municipalities, totaling thirteen units. There were fifteen provincial municipalities, totaling twenty units, and sixty-one county-level units, totaling sixty-seven units. In total, 104 member units participated, with over seventy representatives actually present, and approximately sixty proposals received. The presidium of the general meeting consisted of fifteen people, including Wan Molin, Huang Tongsheng, Zhang Chao, Wang Zhupu, Qu Zhenhua, He Jinwen, Han Dezhao, Zhang Jingwei, Chen Yucai, Zhao Zhangji, Chen Xinzhi, Cai Yushu, Zong Minglun, Yan Jikuan, and Peng Zuo.

A Bridge Between Grain Merchants and the Government

At the opening ceremony, the preparatory director of the association, Wan Molin, first read the opening remarks, stating briefly: This association, after five months of preparation, is now officially established, and we are deeply grateful for the participation of government officials, guests from all walks of life, and grain merchant representatives from various provinces and cities. He then continued to say that the domestic rice issue today is not as dire as imagined. The global food shortage problem is also not as severe as it was last year. Furthermore, last year's domestic rice harvest reached about 70%. As long as there is proper regulation, there should be no issue with rice. Currently, five major cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, have already begun rationing food. Grain also accounts for a large portion of the relief supplies from the United States. The government is actively enriching the grain supply and stabilizing society and the people's livelihood, and the industry should also study how to enable cooperation between the government and the people, so that everyone has food to eat and the strength to eat it.

Then Qu Zhenhua of the presidium delivered a speech, briefly stating: The establishment of this association is a bridge between grain merchants and the government. In the future, we hope to promote cooperation between the government and grain merchants through this. Qu then invited government officials and guests to speak in succession.

Minister Gu Hopes for Two Points

Minister Gu gave a speech, briefly stating: The existence of a national united organization of grain merchants is the first since the founding of the Republic of China. This move has significant meaning for food itself, people's livelihood, and the suppression of the rebellion. Articles 1 and 7 of the Commercial Association Law clearly stipulate the purpose and tasks of commercial associations. Therefore, regarding the establishment of your association, I hope for two points: (1) Strive to improve the organization of your association, achieve the tasks of a commercial association in accordance with a specific purpose, and in addition to safeguarding the interests of the industry, also correct the malpractices of the industry. (2) Assist the government in implementing food policies to stabilize society, people's livelihood, and the economy. Food is the most important thing for the people, so I hope that grain merchants will take on the responsibility of regulation, and in particular, pay attention to safeguarding the interests of the industry under the premise of safeguarding national and social interests.

Minister Yu and Ye Shifu, the representative of Mayor Wu, delivered speeches, hoping that grain merchants would assist the government in stabilizing grain prices. From Mayor Wu's position, he especially hopes that the grain prices in the Shanghai market can be stabilized for a long time.

Chen Quan, the representative of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, gave a speech, briefly stating: I hope that the mission of your association is not only to safeguard the interests of the industry, but also to study how to exert the contribution of the federation. Therefore, I deeply hope that your association will take on the responsibility of guiding grain merchants.

Grain Financing Should be Opened

After the guest Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, Ren Xianqun of the People's Food Allocation Association gave a speech. Ren made three points: (1) The current grain price is not considered high compared to general commodity prices. Therefore, I personally advocate that grain prices should have a reasonable level compared to general commodity prices. The Four Joint Offices has passed measures for national banks and agencies to handle financing for daily necessities, with a monthly interest rate of only five percent, which can reduce transportation costs. Therefore, I personally advocate that grain financing should be opened first. (2) The transportation capacity of grain merchants after the war is far inferior to that before the war, resulting in a shortage of food reserves in some consumption areas. According to statistics, the city's food reserves are only 200,000 dan, so it is not easy to stabilize grain prices for a long time. After studying the situation, it is proposed that the Ministry of Food open grain financing for some cities and store some grain. (3) Under the situation where Shanghai's grain prices are inverted with those in the interior, I deeply feel that today's grain prices cannot be controlled, so I sincerely hope that the government will find a way to restore Shanghai as a center for grain transit, so as to stabilize grain prices.

### Build a Food Fortress and Eliminate the Root of Internal Chaos

Finally, Ji Mingzhai, the representative of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, gave a speech, suggesting that after the representatives return to their respective places after the closing of the conference, they should establish food fortresses separately and jointly eliminate the root of internal chaos.

After the opening ceremony was completed, the first general meeting was held at 4:10 PM. In addition to distributing the preparatory report, Chairman Zhang Chao of the Presidium discussed and passed the association's charter, and the meeting adjourned at about 6:00 PM. The preparatory committee of the conference hosted all the attending representatives at the sixth floor of the China Merchants Bureau on Guangdong Road.

The conference is scheduled to convene group review meetings this morning, and the second general meeting will be held at 2:00 PM this afternoon to elect directors and supervisors and discuss proposals. If time permits, the closing ceremony will be held at 5:00 PM this afternoon. The elected first board of directors and supervisors are scheduled to be sworn in at 2:00 PM on the 24th, followed by the first meeting of the board of directors and supervisors.

### Improve Nutrition for the Seriously Injured and Sick, Preparing to Set Up Military Service Stations

The Joint Logistics Headquarters, in order to plan for various military hospitals and improve the special nutrition of seriously injured and sick military officers and soldiers, specially dispatched Zhu Jingtao, the director of the News Department of the headquarters, to Shanghai. Yesterday, at the Shanghai Port Command, he invited relevant personnel to hold a meeting. After Zhu explained the mission to Shanghai, he immediately discussed thoroughly improving the staple and non-staple foods for injured and sick soldiers, and handling special nutrition issues for seriously injured and sick soldiers. It was decided that the Joint Logistics Headquarters would invite the Military Friends Association to first prepare to set up military service stations for wounded soldiers in the above-mentioned four wounded soldier hospitals, specializing in improving the special nutrition of military casualties. After successful results are achieved, it will be promoted to other military hospitals across the country.

### Gonghexiang Wharf Warehouse, Cotton Burning Causes Heavy Losses

[Report from this newspaper] At about 3:00 PM yesterday, a large batch of foreign-made cotton was suddenly burned in the Gonghexiang Wharf warehouse in Hongkou. It was not until about half an hour later that the fire department drove to the scene to extinguish the fire, causing significant losses.

### Looking at the Issue of Royal Restoration

— First Letter, Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing

[Reuters, Brussels, Fourteenth] Brussels, known as "Little Paris," the Western European flower capital, has become larger and more prosperous than the real Paris after this war.

Having traveled across the European continent for more than half a year since leaving New York, this is the first time I have seen such beautiful department stores and such a prosperous market scene in Brussels. In the evening twilight, if you stand at the North Railway Station of Brussels and look south at the parallel wide roads and the neon lights that rival New York's Times Square, a foreign tourist will be dazzled. In Belgium, you can buy the most expensive French cosmetics, the most modern American fashions, and the most valuable British cigarettes. Belgium also nominally has a "coupon" rationing system, but any store welcomes customers with "coupon" tickets. The Belgian market is free, so free that genuine American goods are more reasonably priced than in New York. A pair of American "nylon" stockings selling for one and a half dollars costs only forty-two Belgian francs in Brussels (about ninety-seven cents). Camel brands, Morris brands, Lucky Strike brands, and a large number of American cigarettes may be cheaper than even the best Belgian cigarettes. Dozens of movie theaters in Brussels, with the exception of a very few that maintain traditional spirits, are almost uniformly showing Hollywood new releases. If it is said that the massive production of the United States after the war must find a market for "dumping" in Europe, Belgium is undoubtedly one of the best in their eyes.

This Year's United Nations General Assembly

To be held in Europe, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Lie, roamed Europe a few days ago to find a "suitable" city. Lie was warmly welcomed in Belgium, and the Brussels municipal authorities are doing their best to win this trophy. According to estimates by Belgian friends, holding a United Nations General Assembly would require at least four or five thousand people, or even six or seven thousand people. It would be difficult to find a city in Europe that can unconditionally and continuously supply such a large amount of material consumption, but Brussels has that qualification. According to them, the only shortcoming is that Brussels cannot find a large venue. There is one in the countryside, but it is too far from the city center. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference was held in Brussels in the past, but that was only on a small scale. The scale of the United Nations General Assembly is undoubtedly much larger.

Prosperity is Never Accidental

First, Belgium's political stability. Although Belgium experienced a major "royal dispute" after the war, Emperor Leopold III remained in Switzerland very sensibly. Recently, he even leisurely took a boat to the New World to roam. Prince Charles, the brother of Leopold III, is now the Regent of Belgium, a typical royal family member who is quiet and self-loving and is very much loved by the Belgian people. Therefore, in general, Belgium's politics are stable. After this war, Belgium also had a considerable number of communists. As a result of last year's election, the Communist Party won four seats in the Senate and twenty-three seats in the House of Representatives (the House of Representatives has a total of two hundred and two seats). However, the Communist Party of Belgium has rarely had disputes. They take a consistent stance with the Socialist Party on opposing the restoration of Leopold III and are very persistent. Other than that, they have no further intentions. When I arrived in Belgium in 1945, people throughout Belgium liked to talk about the "royal issue." More than two years have passed, and the issue has not yet been resolved, but the Belgian people are much more indifferent. After Mr. Spaak, the former President of the United Nations General Assembly, was honorably appointed Prime Minister of Belgium last year, the Parliament passed a resolution authorizing Spaak to negotiate in detail with Emperor Leopold on whether to restore the throne and what conditions would apply. Spaak has the preliminary full power to decide. Before the Emperor crossed to America, Spaak took his entourage to Switzerland once. It is said that he talked with the Emperor for two hours. The royal family provided a lot of evidence that Leopold opposed the Nazi fascists, proving that he did not willingly "submit" to Hitler. The most powerful piece of evidence was that the Emperor once had a secret "blood edict" that was brought to the Belgian government-in-exile in London a year before the Nazi collapse, advocating "fighting to the end and the Nazis will be defeated." This matter was published in a newspaper. However, Spaak's trip to Switzerland was not made public. What is the medicine in the gourd? Outsiders have no way of knowing. One day, I was eating at the home of an aristocrat who had relatives in the royal family. The Baroness told me: "All the devout Catholic believers in Belgium welcome the Emperor to return." She also determined that Spaak himself also loved the royal family, "because he is a capable and visionary politician." Later, I asked a gentleman from the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He shook his head and said, "Let's not talk about this issue. This issue is now in a state of hibernation." However, after I repeatedly circled the question, he said, "The current Prime Minister Spaak is a Socialist, and the Socialist Party's decision is to oppose the Emperor's restoration!" He laughed and said, "So, the problem becomes complicated, and the reason for the complexity lies here!"

Those who oppose the restoration of the royal family are not only the Socialist Party. The Communist Party is undoubtedly the "obvious responsibility," and some people in the Liberal Party also express the same opinion. Only the Catholic Party is 100% purely "royalist."

The Catholic Party has always been the largest political party in Belgium. Currently, out of the forty-four seats in the Senate, the Catholic Party has twenty-one seats. Out of the two hundred and two seats in the House of Representatives, the Catholic Party occupies ninety-two seats. They almost all occupy an "overwhelming injury." Before Spaak came to power, Belgium was a coalition cabinet of the Socialist, Liberal, and Communist parties. At that time, the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union had not yet become extremely acute, and the Eastern and Western European blocs had not yet been divided too clearly. Therefore, the three parties formed a coalition, and the Catholic Party was excluded from the opposition, becoming the only opposition party. Spaak's rise to power was after the division and confrontation between the Eastern and Western European groups. On the other hand, it also reflected the rightward turn of the Socialist Party in Western Europe, the so-called "Second International" in Western Europe. Therefore, he courted the Catholic Party to join the cabinet, kicked out the Communist Party in the first step, and then excluded the relatively weak "Liberal Party." Relying on the mutual international support of the Socialist Party in Western Europe and Spaak's outstanding talent, he has the means to stabilize the political situation in Belgium. In addition, the industrious character of the Belgian people...

All industrial recovery has exceeded the pre-war state. When I arrived in Brussels in 1945, shortly after the end of the war, I already felt that it was a paradise in Western Europe after the disaster. This time, revisiting, I feel that such a small country with abundant resources and a prosperous people is lovely. Many international businessmen say that Belgium is the richest country in the world besides the United States today. I once mentioned this "overpraise" to Mr. Wass of the Information Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He laughed happily and said: "We dare not say rich, but we dare to boast that Belgium's recovery and construction are rapid. Whatever Belgium had before the war, Belgium has today. The degree of recovery in many industries has long exceeded 100%. Therefore, we have today's superficial prosperity!"

### New Recruits from Wuxian, Wujiang, and Other Three Counties Gather in Suzhou to be Dispatched

[Report from Suzhou, this newspaper, 22nd] The new recruits from the first phase of conscription in the three counties of Wuxian, Wujiang, and Changshu under the jurisdiction of the Wuxian Regiment Management District have been gathered in Suzhou and are scheduled to take a car to Xuzhou for training on the morning of the 23rd.

It is specifically stipulated that it is not allowed to force their way into people's homes and arrest the selected draftees. Those who violate this will be severely punished in accordance with the crime of obstructing military service.

### Early Spring Southern Kapok Red

[News from Guangzhou, this newspaper, 20th] After the Lunar New Year, the weather has been clear for days, with gentle breezes and bright sunshine, making it a good day for spring outings. The kapok trees, a special product of Guangzhou, have bloomed early due to the particularly warm spring this year. The bright flowers on the trees are blooming red all over Yuexiu Mountain and various parks, embellishing the spring scenery of this southern country and making it more charming. However, in today's high-pressure life, who has the leisure to appreciate it? Although the spring scenery is good, it is only to be disappointed.

A Wave of Inflation

After the "People's Day," everything in the city returned to normal activities, and people were gathering their energy to wait for the good news brought to them by the New Year. Who knew that what came with the spring breeze was a terrible wave of inflation. First, public utilities took the lead: the electricity bill per degree increased from 8,000 to 16,000 yuan, the basic telephone bill increased from 200,000 to 400,000 yuan, and the water bill also increased to 19,000 yuan per mile, an average increase of one time. As a result, general merchants, with the opportunity to take advantage, also raised the prices of goods uniformly. In addition, in recent days, the financial and commodity price fluctuations in Beijing and Shanghai have had an impact, and the market prices of gold and foreign currencies have risen step by step; and daily necessities such as rice, oil, salt, sugar, flour, miscellaneous grains, cotton textiles, and firewood have all skyrocketed. This made the general public, looking back at the increase in commodity price indices last year and looking forward to the days after this year, truly shudder.

Salary Adjustment

This year, people's lives are so difficult, and the government, which is supported by the people, is naturally even poorer. The deficit in Guangdong Province's government expenses is becoming increasingly large and is already an undeniable fact. This time, the central government clearly ordered the adjustment of salaries for civil servants nationwide. Guangzhou is listed as the second district and pays salaries according to 115,000 times the salary. This was originally good news for civil servants, but Guangdong Province's finances are fundamentally unsustainable. The central government can only subsidize 70% of the increased government expenses after the salary adjustment, and the remaining 30% must be raised locally. According to the current income situation in Guangdong Province, although local tax revenue has increased in recent years, the difference is still far away. Therefore, under the principle of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, the Guangdong Provincial Finance Department is now only actively organizing tidal flats and preparing to open a slaughter tax to increase revenue. Because tidal flats are a very large source of wealth in Guangdong Province, distributed in coastal areas along the river. According to pre-war statistics, there were more than 5 million mu in the province, and tidal flats are formed by alluvial deposits and are newly created every year, so there must be more than this figure now. Unfortunately, they have not been organized for more than ten years, and only 900,000 mu are currently taxed. The remaining 4 million mu have not been taxed. If, after being organized, their ownership is determined, the government's tax revenue will be very considerable. However, these are all future problems. Organizing tidal flats and opening a slaughter tax must go through a period of time before they can be implemented. However, the salary adjustment is a pressing issue that needs to be resolved. Under these circumstances, the provincial government can only take the path of layoffs. The number of layoffs is expected to be 10%, that is, more than 700 people out of more than 7,000 civil servants in the provincial-level agencies. It is said that this method has been decided, and the standard for leaving or staying depends on the merits of the work. Those who are laid off will be given a severance payment of one month to one and a half months and will be introduced to work in various counties. Then, there will be more than 700 more people in the ranks of the unemployed.

Administrative Plan

Chairman Song Ziwen has been in Guangdong for several months since taking office, and on the surface, it is really impossible to see any significant achievements; but he is a pragmatic person who is never willing to pre-issue "blank checks" and would rather announce the facts after they are available. In fact, in these few months, he has deeply understood the actual situation of the place, collected a lot of valuable information, and has a comprehensive plan for the entire political and economic construction of Guangdong Province and South China; this plan can be seen slightly from the declaration jointly issued by him and Mr. Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the Assets Committee. Chairman Song really has superhuman vision. All of his facilities not only stabilize the present, but also look forward to the future and plan for the future; such as building dikes to prevent floods is one example. Last year's floods in Guangdong Province were severe, as everyone in the country knows. Chairman Song first paid attention to this issue at the beginning of his tenure, and soon launched various circles to organize and establish a dyke committee responsible for handling the repair projects of the dykes around the rivers. It started construction in December last year, mobilizing 190,000 civilian workers every day, and is expected to be completed before April of this year, so that the floods in the spring of this year will not flood and cause disaster.

Economic Construction

In terms of food, the authorities also made preparations early; in addition to the fundamental aspect, the government lent a large number of high-quality rice seeds to farmers and guided them to improve cultivation methods to increase production; at the same time, it strengthened the control of food and severely investigated and punished the smuggling of food exports; and in order to meet the needs of the hunger gap, it purchased grain from neighboring provinces such as Hunan and Guangxi before and after, reaching 60,000 dan, and more than 10,000 dan are still on the way. Recently, it has also asked the central government to negotiate with the Siamese government to find ways to help Guangdong with Siamese rice; therefore, it is believed that there will be no grain shortage this spring and summer. In addition, there are various economic construction plans, such as: Wengjiang Hydropower Station, Henan Textile Factory, Qiongya Iron and Steel Factory, Shunde Sugar Factory, and the development of the Ruyuan Baziling Coal Mine, which are all in active progress. In recent days, overseas returnees and some foreign businessmen have had frequent contact with Chairman Song, and they are completely negotiating these issues. Therefore, our vision for the economic construction of South China is infinitely glorious and brilliant; the current obstacle to all this development is the harassment of bandits in various places, which is the most regrettable thing.

### Min Caijin Arrested on Suspicion

### A Conversation with Mayor Zhou Xiangxian by West Lake

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 26th] Spring has arrived, and the renowned garden city of Hangzhou is gradually adorning itself with delicate colors, captivating all who see it. The spring season on West Lake this year is expected to be more lively than in previous years, as many have anticipated. Zhou Qiyu, the veteran mayor who has served three terms in Hangzhou, shares this view. He happily told me, "In previous years, only foreigners came to Hangzhou for the Spring Festival. This year, many people from Shanghai are coming to Hangzhou to spend the Spring Festival. I believe this year's spring pilgrimage will far surpass last year's." He also said, "From the time of the Lunar New Year until today, not a single robbery has occurred in Hangzhou. During the Spring Festival, rickshaw pullers, boatmen, and laborers have all earned exceptionally well, which helps stabilize the lower strata of society. If this spring pilgrimage is another prosperous year, then everything in Hangzhou will be stable."

Hangzhou is truly a city that "relies on one spring after three winters." Last year, business conditions were quite good in various places, including Shanghai and Nanjing, so many people will take advantage of this time of renewal to spend money and enjoy the scenery of the lake and mountains, without worrying about anything else. In Hangzhou's taverns and restaurants, it is still possible to order full-course meals, and more lavish options are also available. Compared to Shanghai, it is naturally much more liberal. This is partly because the banquet tax from food establishments accounts for a large portion of the municipal government's revenue. Mayor Zhou also has a theory about this, namely that Hangzhou is a scenic area, and people who come to scenic areas are naturally more likely to sightsee. If sightseers are restricted in their dining options, it will inevitably dampen their spirits. Moreover, Hangzhou's food establishments rely entirely on tourists. If regulations are too strict, the food establishments will not be able to survive. Mayor Zhou told me that thrift is good, but thrift still depends on conscience. If, in terms of dining, one eats a dish and then the plate is taken away only to be replaced by another dish, such thrift is futile. The Pacific Travel Agency has been in contact with the municipal government, willing to undertake the renovation of the famous historical sites around West Lake in Hangzhou, but it wants to place advertisements for major manufacturers. Mayor Zhou told me that assistance to the municipal government in constructing scenic spots is naturally welcome. We will see whether it is effective this year, otherwise, the original agreement will be cancelled. As for the reconstruction of the Leifeng Pagoda, it is not something that can be easily discussed in the short term. According to him, there are more urgent matters than the Leifeng Pagoda, so the reconstruction of the Leifeng Pagoda can only be discussed later."

According to Mayor Zhou, the prices in Hangzhou are still relatively stable, much cheaper than in Shanghai. Some people from Shanghai who ate at Lou Wai Lou once exclaimed how cheap it was, and others who stayed in a high-end hotel for one night also found it very affordable. Therefore, although Hangzhou people "scrape cucumbers" during the spring season, it is still cheaper than in Shanghai at ordinary times. However, with the spring pilgrimage approaching, the Hangzhou municipal government is urgently organizing the repair of various roads and scenic areas. According to Mayor Zhou, all the asphalt roads need to be repaired. Based on last year's experience, 540 barrels of asphalt are needed. Currently, the price of asphalt is 5 million yuan per barrel, so 500 barrels of asphalt will cost 2.5 billion yuan. In addition, painting and renovating the railings of Hubin Park, decorating the front of Zhongshan Park, repairing the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, and slightly arranging the various scenic spots will cost a total of 5 billion yuan. Although the municipal government does not have money, it is necessary to do this. So, 1 billion was raised to secure the asphalt. The municipal government's financial situation is certainly very difficult. For January and February, they wanted to supplement the new salary standards for their colleagues, but Zhou believed that if they supplemented the new standards, they would have to delay paying the new standards for March, which would only make the colleagues feel more hardship. Therefore, it is better to pay salaries according to the new standards from March onwards, so as not to cause delays. Currently, the Hangzhou municipal government has a total of 320 employees, excluding those in business units. It is said that according to the central system, there should be 520 employees, so the municipal government can avoid being affected by this round of staff reduction in Zhejiang Province.

During my conversation with Mayor Zhou, I asked him whether the merchants who benefit from the flourishing spring pilgrimage could contribute to the scenic areas after the pilgrimage. Zhou shook his head with a smile and said, "Now the currency is devalued, and everything is difficult to handle. Before the war, the municipal government's annual budget was 3 million yuan, and the monthly operating expenses were 150,000 yuan, which was sufficient to cover everything. Now the figures are huge, but there is a sense of neglecting one thing while attending to another. It is really difficult. I think that when the currency stabilizes, the municipal government can carry out a major revival. Under the current circumstances, this is the only way." He felt deeply distressed that Hangzhou's social activities today are not lively enough. In order to ensure that this year's spring pilgrimage is more lively than in previous years, and to prevent the crowds coming to visit and burn incense from becoming too congested, leading to a night spent walking on the streets, sleeping on boats, or lingering on rickshaws as they did last year, Mayor Zhou has ordered all hotels to prepare a large number of canvas beds to accommodate travelers, so that people coming to Hangzhou will not find themselves with money but no place to stay.

### Expansion and Reorganization of Jiangsu Provincial Security Command

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 22nd] In order to cooperate with the national policies of mobilization and suppression of rebellion, the Jiangsu Provincial Security Command has decided to expand and reorganize its original structure. Chairman Wang will continue to serve as the commander, and the command will have three departments: Staff, Police Security, and News. Except for the head of the Staff Department, whose selection is pending approval from the central government, the Police Security and News Departments will be reorganized from the Fourth Section of the Civil Affairs Department and the expanded Political Department of the command, respectively. The reorganization is expected to be completed by March 1.

### Recent Developments in Shandong Politics

[Our Jinan Airmail Dispatch, 19th] The military developments of the past six months have caused the Shandong battlefield to gradually fade from the memory of the people. With the National Army's recovery of the Yimeng Mountain area, the stabilization of Jiaodong, the liberation of Yantai, and the successive southward escapes of Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi's main bandit forces to Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, countless people have been shouting, "The Shandong war is nearing its end," and "Shandong has virtually become the rear of the rear!"

This view is based on some factual basis. In particular, the unimpeded passage of the Xuzhou-Jinan section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway for more than two months has given the people of Qilu, who originally lived in the flames of war, a temporary respite. Those who live in the Northeast and Hebei-Shanxi-Chahar, where the flames of war are still raging, and those who live in Jiangnan, which was originally the most stable but is now approaching the brink of war, will naturally all say in unison, "Shandong has entered a relatively stable period of prosperity!"

In fact, although a part of Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng's main force was defeated in Shandong, their remnants adopted empty-city tactics and quickly fled south. Moreover, due to the tight situation in the Northeast, the National Army, in order to control the Beining Railway, transferred a large army that originally occupied more than one-third of the government-controlled area in Shandong to the south or north before they could completely eliminate the local Eighth Route Army of the Shandong Communists. This objectively gave the Shandong Communists an opportunity to take advantage of. "Wildfires cannot be extinguished; they will spring up again in the spring breeze." The local Eighth Route Army and the regular 2nd, 7th, 9th, and 13th Columns of the Shandong Communists, possessing 96 regiments and occupying an absolute advantage, are once again playing "you come and I go, you go and I come."

As of October last year, when the Shandong war reached its climax, the National Army occupied 67 counties and 3 ordinary cities out of the province's 107 counties and 3 ordinary cities. However, due to the large-scale external transfer of the National Army and the insufficient allocation of troops, non-strategic points had to be abandoned again. Therefore, as of now, only 41 counties and cities remain in the hands of the National Army, and only 14 of these counties and cities are truly under the full control of the government. The rest are still semi-controlled areas and stronghold-controlled areas.

Faced with this riddled situation, Wang Yaowu, the concurrent chairman of Shandong, once personally formulated five key tasks as the guidelines for this year's administration: cultivating cadres, organizing the masses, consolidating local armed forces, eliminating scattered bandits, and increasing production. Regarding the shortcomings of the past local troops, Wang said that the main problems were: "lack of training for cadres," "inadequate training methods," "unreasonable recruitment and compensation system," and "complex and inconsistent organization," which made it difficult to use them flexibly and prevented their strength from being brought into play. Therefore, Wang proposed that this year's reorganization method should focus on the four major goals of "unified organization," "unified treatment," "unified education," and "unified command," and vigorously advocate the spirit of "one person, one gun." He did not adopt the method of formal expansion, but insisted on thoroughly transforming the troops in terms of concepts, awareness, spirit, and substance before they could restore the strength of defending their homes and pacifying the local area.

Whether the Shandong war can truly come to an end depends mainly on the effectiveness of the five key tasks marked by Chairman Wang. In these five key tasks, consolidating local armed forces is the "key of keys," because stability comes first. Without sound and powerful local armed forces, it is impossible to achieve the purpose of stabilizing the local area. (Special Correspondent Li Tian)

### Comparison of Chinese and Japanese Raw Silk Exports

(Continued from Page 7)

According to statistics from the US Reconstruction Finance Corporation, in March of the 36th year, the US Commercial Company sold 1,525 bales of Japanese raw silk in the US, worth $948,893. Since the US Commercial Company began selling Japanese raw silk in July of the 35th year, it had sold a total of 28,248 bales of Japanese raw silk by the end of March of the 36th year, worth US$27,669,173. As of the end of March, the company had a total of 56,216 bales of Japanese raw silk in stock. As of the end of February, Japan's domestic raw silk inventory available for export totaled 61,407 bales. Comparing these figures with the aforementioned figures for China's raw silk exports to the US in the first eleven months of last year (approximately 11,000 bales), it can be seen that Japanese raw silk still occupies an overwhelming advantage in the US market.

Japan plans to produce 300,000 bales of silk annually for export in the next five years, and its largest customer will undoubtedly be the United States. According to estimates by US silk industry experts, the US raw silk market can absorb 600,000 bales annually in the future. If China can produce 300,000 bales of silk annually for export within five years, it can still compete for half of the US raw silk market. However, as a result of this war of resistance, China's silk industry has suffered enormous losses and is difficult to recover. According to estimates by the China Silk Company, China's wartime silk losses are as follows: A, Silk production losses: (1) Losses in domestic silkworm silk production: 1,603,000 dan. (2) Losses in tussah silk production: 400,000 dan. Total: 2,003,000 dan. B, Equipment losses: (1) 2,600,000 silkworm farming households were damaged, with a total loss of 2,360,000,000 yuan. (2) Seed production decreased by 4,600,000 sheets, with a total loss of 10,900,000 yuan. (3) The silk industry lost 45,000 silk looms, with a total loss of 28,100,000 yuan. (4) Other losses totaled 2,500,000 yuan. Total equipment losses: 300,000,000 yuan (pre-war legal tender value). C, Mulberry garden abandonment losses: (1) 2,180,000 mu of mulberry gardens were abandoned, with a loss of 1,132,000,000 mulberry trees. (2) 5,360,000 mu of mulberry gardens were damaged, requiring the replenishment and renewal of 868,000,000 mulberry trees. The total number of mulberry trees lost was 2,000,000,000. With such huge losses, seeking to restore pre-war production and seeking to increase it has become a major current issue. It is estimated that the silk production in the 37th year will be as follows: Factory silk, spun silk, and native silk in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui areas can reach 44,000 piculs. Factory silk, small factory silk, and native silk in the Sichuan and Yunnan areas: 15,000 piculs. Factory silk and native silk in the Guangdong area: 12,000 piculs. Tussah silk: 10,000 dan. Silk from other provinces: 1,400 piculs. The total is approximately 82,400 piculs. Excluding domestic sales, the amount that can be exported is likely to be 55,000 dan, which is also extremely limited. In the future, how to provide technical improvement, business guidance, financial support, and export promotion for China's silk industry all require the concerted efforts of all parties in order to increase production and expand sales channels. Otherwise, it will be difficult to gain a foothold in the competition with Japan for the raw silk market in the future. (January of the 37th year, Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office)

### Jixi Asbestos Mine with National Defense Value

[Our Huizhou Dispatch, 18th] Jixi is located in the heart of southern Anhui and Huining, through which the Huangshan Mountain range passes, and is rich in mineral resources. In addition to gold, tungsten, and silver deposits, it also contains asbestos, which is highly valued throughout the world. The mine was discovered in the early years of the Republic of China. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, the Anhui Construction Department sent mining experts Shen Guozhen and Mai Jianzhi, Dean of the College of Science of Wuhan University, to Jixi for inspection. The results of the inspection showed that the mineral quality was excellent.

Experts value the discovery of the mine. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, villagers near the mine saw piles of rocks in the mountains that were white in color and extremely hard, and thought they could be used to make lime. They took them to burn, but they remained tough and difficult to melt into ash. Therefore, they used the water power of the mountain stream to grind the stones into fine powder in a water mill, mixed it with slaked lime, and used it to plaster walls. Not only was it strong and white, but it was also exceptionally beautiful. Later, it was discovered that it had fireproofing properties. Experts also determined that these rocks were undoubtedly asbestos ore.

In the 23rd year of the Republic of China, a product exhibition was held along the Wuhu-Tunxi Highway in this province. The villagers in the mining area also sent this stone to the exhibition. After experts examined and researched it, they also recognized that this type of asbestos was of excellent quality. For a time, it aroused the attention of the authorities in this province and local merchants.

Large area

The location of the mining area is in Xikengtou, northeast of Jixi County, on Chenggong Mountain and Huanglian Ridge in the Shuishi Village Society. The mining area is full of rocky mountains, and the stones are mostly gray in color. In the middle of the gray stones, there are strips of white stone with very clear textures. This white stone is asbestos. The large stone vein surface of the mining area has overlapping scaly stone flakes as large as rice bowls, like dragon scales. The mining area covers an area of approximately 42 ares, with a thickness of about eight inches.

Heat resistance

Asbestos has great uses, and is most resistant to burning. Even in extremely high heat, it cannot damage its silk filaments. Its only unique effect is to prevent fires. It can be used to make all fire fighting tools. It is the most valuable mineral in science. It is rarely seen in China. Even in all countries of the world, asbestos with national defense characteristics is very important and extremely needed.

Development value

In the 25th year of the Republic of China, Dean Mai of Wuhan University personally visited the mining area and submitted a report to the Construction Department for registration, obtaining a license to mine the mine. Subsequently, Hong Yulin, a Shanghai mining merchant, also submitted an application to the Construction Department to mine the mine. The total area of the asbestos mining area is 42 ares and 25 square meters. However, the mining was suspended due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan.

Recently, a businessman in the county, Mr. Hu, intends to develop the valuable resources of his hometown, and plans to unite with farmers in the mining area, collect their own funds, and try to mine it using indigenous methods. It is said that he has consulted with mineralogical experts in Beijing and Shanghai, and this plan is scheduled to be carried out this year. (Special Correspondent Yu Ningpo)

### Fudan Punishes Students for Participating in the Tongji Incident

[Our Dispatch] Fudan University held its tenth moral education meeting the day before yesterday. Regarding the small number of students from the school who participated in the Tongji University dispute at the end of last month, they did not abide by school rules, but there was no transgressive behavior at the time. Moreover, given that the school is close to Tongji University, it was decided that the participating students may have been motivated by temporary curiosity. Therefore, a severe warning will be given, and they will be observed at all times to see the effect. If there are any further violations of school regulations or actions that harm the reputation of society, heavier penalties will be imposed to maintain school discipline. As for the four students who were present to see them off at the time, Chen Baorong, Guan Baoquan, Tang Huina, and Zhong Zaipu, they had previously violated school rules and had been punished with probation. Chen Baorong should be ordered to suspend school starting from this semester. Guan Baoquan, Tang Huina, and Zhong Zaipu, in addition to being placed on probation, should be ordered to bring their parents and guarantors to the school to write letters of repentance before they are allowed to register.

### Wusong Fisheries College Adopts New Five-Year System

New Student Entrance Exam to be Held on the 24th

[Our Dispatch] Before the war, Wusong had a fisheries school, which was founded by Zhang Jian and others during the late Qing Dynasty. After the establishment of the National Government, Cai Yuanpei and others advocated for the establishment of specialized departments such as deep-sea fishing and navigation. Over the decades, it gradually developed into the center of technical talent for China's fishing and navigation industries. Graduates served in regions as far as around the world and enjoyed considerable prestige internationally. The school was destroyed in the war during the Anti-Japanese War, which is a great pity. After the victory, local gentry and various fisheries organizations, joint organizations, Chinese and foreign fisheries experts from the Executive Yuan, and the alumni association of the Wusong Fisheries School, in view of this, repeatedly suggested to the city's Education Bureau to submit the application to the Ministry of Education for approval to restore the school. It was designated as a new five-year college, called "Shanghai Municipal Wusong Fisheries College." Hou Zhaohai, the former principal of Wusong Fisheries School, was appointed as principal and actively prepared for the restoration of the school and recruited well-known domestic fisheries and maritime experts as professors. The training class building of the Fishery Management Office on Fuxing Island in Yangshupu was temporarily borrowed as a school building. At present, various equipment is largely in place, and recruitment of first and second-year students of the fishing major has begun. Those taking the first-year exam must have completed junior high school, and those taking the second-year exam must have completed advanced fisheries or one year of senior high school. In addition to Shanghai, recruitment is also being conducted separately in Qingdao, Taiwan, Guangzhou, Xiamen, and other places. The registration locations in Shanghai are China Fisheries Corporation on East Changzhi Road and Fishery Syndicate on Jiangxi Road. The entrance exam will be held on the 24th of this month at Gezhi High School on Guangxi Road. New students will be exempted from tuition fees, and the remaining fees will be handled in accordance with the regulations for fees at Shanghai's specialized colleges.

### Lu Yinggeng Hosts Banquet to Welcome Catholic Education Representatives and Celebrate Tian Gengxin's Elevation to Cardinal

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday was the second anniversary of Cardinal Tian Gengxin's ordination as a cardinal. Lu Yinggeng, president of the Shanghai Catholic Action General Association, hosted a banquet at his private residence last night to celebrate and welcome the representatives of the National Catholic Education Conference. Those in attendance included Cardinal Tian Gengxin, Apostolic Nuncio to China Archbishop Li Peili, Archbishop Yu Bin, Bishop Hui Jiliang, Archbishop Zhao Xinji, Archbishop Mei Zhankui, Archbishop Zhou Jishi, Archbishop Li Lujia, Archbishop Wan Jiulou, and dozens of others. The Lu brothers provided diligent hospitality, and the atmosphere was grand and lively.

Lu's Speech

During the banquet, Lu Yinggeng rose to deliver a welcome speech, which briefly stated: "The First National Catholic Education Conference held in Shanghai is an unprecedented event, and I am extremely pleased. I am hosting a small feast to fulfill my duty as a host and to celebrate the anniversary of Cardinal Tian Gengxin's elevation to the rank of Cardinal by Pope Pius XII in Rome two years ago today. I am honored to have so many distinguished guests present. The ancient scriptures record that Saint Abraham met three travelers on the road one day. Because they were tired from the journey, Saint Abraham welcomed them to his home and treated them sincerely, expressing the affectionate sentiment that 'all within the four seas are brothers.' Unexpectedly, the three travelers were angels sent by God. I am unworthy, but I can only imitate the saint and entertain you priests, who represent Jesus in the world. I am extremely pleased.

Recalling the Past

Recalling that when I was young, my late father, Bo Hong, told me that after the Lu family was converted to Catholicism by Xu Guangqi during the late Ming Dynasty, in the early Qing Dynasty, when Catholicism was not yet developed in China, our ancestors received bishops and priests in their private residences, allowing them to study Chinese literature before sending them to various places to preach and run charitable education in the countryside. There were also Catholic followers who stayed at home to study doctrine and read scriptures. Therefore, the church still allows mass to be held in the chapel in our home to commemorate the occasion, and a special ceremony is held around Easter every year, which I am deeply honored to be a part of. I wish to follow the legacy of my ancestors and am very willing to receive you priests at any time, and I ask for your teachings at any time," etc. After the speech, he raised his glass to celebrate Long live the Pope, Long live President Chiang, Long live Cardinal Tian, Nuncio Li, Archbishop Yu, Bishop Hui, and all the bishops and priests may have good health and flourishing virtues. Finally, Bishop Zhang Weidu of Xinyang, representing the entire group, gave a speech of thanks, praising the late philanthropist Lu Bohong for establishing charitable education and dedicating his life to the church and family. He made many contributions and was deeply admired. Everyone applauded, and the guests and hosts parted in joy.

### Soaring Prices, Sharply Increased Tuition: Xiamen University Students on the Brink of Dropping Out: Request Ministry of Education to Grant Full Public Funding

[Our Xiamen, 20th Dispatch] Xiamen University students are feeling great difficulty in their lives due to the soaring prices in recent days. Those receiving public funding can make up for it slightly, but the half-public funded and self-funded students, who account for more than half, are largely unable to pay the monthly tuition of 7-8 million yuan and are truly on the verge of dropping out. A group of students from the school recently launched a joint petition to the Ministry of Education requesting full public funding (i.e., changing all students to publicly funded students), which has been supported by more than 400 students. The proposal has also been telegraphed to the school president in Nanjing, urging him to strive for it nearby. It is also reported that because of increased expenses this semester, a small number of poor students are unable to afford them and have automatically dropped out of school since this semester, with more than 40 people.

### People's Livelihood Education: Grasping the Historical Center of Gravity: Solving People's Livelihood Problems

— Wang Yukai

People's livelihood is the center of gravity of history. The rise and fall, order and chaos recorded in history, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, are all reflections of people's livelihood problems. The time of prosperity and governance of a country or dynasty is when its people's livelihood problems are fully resolved. Conversely, the time of decline and chaos is when its people's livelihood problems experience severe panic and social unrest. Successful heroes and wise statesmen all follow this historical iron rule.

How can we determine the center of gravity of history and prevent the country and society from following the wrong path of the past? It depends on education. You can conquer the world on horseback, but you cannot govern the world on horseback. Those who govern the world must use civil rule, that is, education. Therefore, I put forward people's livelihood education to contribute to those who govern the country and bring peace to the world, to help grasp the center of gravity of history.

People's livelihood education is roughly the same as Mr. Du Wei's advocated "life is education." Education cannot be separated from the practical life of the people. In other words, education must help the people seek solutions to their lives. The Principle of People's Livelihood in the Three Principles of the People is based on the idea that people's livelihood is the center of gravity of history and sets out a plan to solve people's livelihood problems, which depends entirely on education to realize it. This is the task of people's livelihood education. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the basic elements of people's livelihood problems. Education should impart relevant knowledge and skills to the people in these four areas so that everyone can enjoy their convenience. Taking clothing as an example, from winter fur to summer linen, to winter wool to summer silk, the source and supply of these raw materials raises the two issues of production and transportation. In terms of food, China is based on agriculture, but there is a shortage of food. Since ancient times, people have known that food is the most important thing for the people, but the people's food is worrying, and there are more problems that need to be solved. In terms of housing, from afforestation to construction, are all specialized knowledge, and Chinese housing does not pay attention to environmental design. Since the restoration, the increase in the urban population has made the housing problem serious. How will we solve it? In terms of transportation, if we measure the level of national civilization by the shortness of the roads, then China's transportation requires us to double our efforts to build roads. And the construction problem, the Principle of People's Livelihood has a plan to guide, which requires people's livelihood education to implement it.

We should frankly admit that our education, both in the past and now, has not been able to shoulder the mission of people's livelihood education. Although the purpose of education includes the development of people's livelihood, education and life have still not been able to be coordinated in the past ten years, let alone education is life. Someone said: The difference between Chinese and American education is that Chinese education teaches people things that are not completely needed, while American education teaches people things that are completely needed. Today we should correct this. Education is one of the vital forces of modern countries, and it should not be misunderstood again, let alone be separated from the Principle of People's Livelihood. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's definition of the word "people's livelihood" is: "The people's life, the survival of society, the livelihood of the country, and the life of the masses." But the people's life (clothing, food, housing, and transportation) is the most important, so livelihood, survival, and life are only the enrichment and expansion of life. Therefore, people's livelihood education also focuses on seeking solutions to the people's life. It regards the survival of society, the livelihood of the country, and the lives of the masses as enrichment and expansion of the people's lives. Solving the problem of people's lives will naturally solve the three problems of survival, livelihood, and life.

People's livelihood education is education that uses both hands and brains. Using the brain on one hand and using the hands on the other, there is no distinction between those who labor with their minds and those who labor with their bodies, and there is no distinction between gentlemen and commoners. Only in this way can we achieve equality in education and stabilize the center of gravity of history, without the cycle of prosperity and decline, order and chaos. The people's lives develop upward, enrich, beautify, and bring happiness. People's livelihood education is also living education, doing on one hand and learning on the other, and what we do and learn is what life needs. When we learn agriculture, the farmland is the experimental field. When we learn industry, the factory is the research institute. Living education is also society is school.

Today there are too many problems in education, that is because people's livelihood problems have not been properly resolved. Therefore, everyone has their own opinions and each has their own argument. Those who start from the perspective of occupation advocate vocational education. Those who start from the perspective of production advocate production education. These can all be included in democratic education. Anyone who recognizes that people's livelihood is the center of gravity of history and grasps this center of gravity to seek the country must implement people's livelihood education.

### Hong Kong Side Proposes Five Suggestions for World Cup Football Selection: Rong Qizhao Will Forward to the Sports Association for a Reply

[Our News Agency] The Hong Kong Branch of the Sports Association has been in a state of disorganization due to previous issues. Since Chen Rongbai, the vice chairman of South China Sports Association, came forward to mediate, after several consultations, the Sports Association branch was finally reorganized, with Cai Huihong as the chairman, Zhong Zhiqiang as the secretary-general, and Lei Ruixiong as the treasurer. The organizational work of the various associations is currently underway separately.

At present, the selection of World Cup football players has been decided to be handled by the Hong Kong Sports Association Branch. Chen Rongbai, due to the heavy workload of the Sports Association, specially invited representatives of all sports associations to a gathering at his residence on the evening of the 16th, on the one hand to discuss how to handle the World Cup selection. On the other hand, it was to celebrate the success. That night, representatives of the 11 basic members of the Sports Association were present (the eleven basic members are South China, Sing Tao, Kwong Wah, Eastern, Kitchee, Chinese, Bus, Chung Mou, Taikoo, Chinese Recreation Club, Youth Society), and Rong Qizhao was also invited.

Hong Kong's Five Points of View

Chen Rongbai gave a speech first: He said that Hong Kong's overseas Chinese sports are developing vigorously, especially football, and should not be restricted by outsiders everywhere. In order to unite and face the outside world, the Sports Association should step up its full cooperation. Then they discussed how to proceed with the selection of players to participate in the World Cup. The Hong Kong Chinese Football Association had submitted five points of view to the Association for reference, and the secretary-general Zhong Zhiqiang read out the five points of view in public. Regarding the inquiries: (1) Guarantee of players' travel expenses. (2) Please announce the selection of the football team leader immediately. (3) How should the family living expenses be handled during the players' departure period. Regarding the two suggestions: (4) The preliminary selection adopts a regional competition system, and the champion team's selection of players must not be less than six people and no more than twelve people. The runner-up team will select from four to nine people, and the third-place team will select from two to six people. The number of people who are not enough will be selected from other teams participating in the preliminary selection. (5) In addition to the original five members of the selection committee, the Hong Kong Sports Association Branch may send two more members, and the Overseas Chinese Association may send two more members.

Rong Qizhao's Reply

After reading, Rong Qizhao replied separately: (1) Regarding the football team's return travel expenses, the government has allocated 150,000 US dollars for the World Cup delegation's expenses, so there is no need to worry about the return travel expenses. (2) I will be responsible for the football team leader, but if there are any talents, I welcome them. (3) Regarding the players' living expenses (referring to family living expenses during the departure period), Rong Qizhao said that it should be handled in accordance with the National Sports Association's amateur rules. Before these rules are changed, I dare not propose other methods. As for the fourth and fifth items, because there are conflicts with what was originally set by the National Sports Advancement Association, I must send a letter to ask for instructions before I can reply.

At this point in the meeting, the Hong Kong Sports Association Branch first discussed how to carry out the work, and resolved: (1) All five suggestions from the Chinese Football Association were accepted. (2) The suggestions will be forwarded to Dr. Rong to be presented to the Association. (3) Regarding the preparations for handling the selection work, South China, Sing Tao, Eastern, China, Kwong Wah, Kitchee, and Bus will each send one representative to discuss the implementation.

### Great Britain Is Actively Preparing for This Year's Olympic Games: Seventeen Sports, Fifty Countries Participating

This article is written by Sir Burghley, Chairman of the Organizing Committee of the British Olympic World Games. It is published in The Sunday Times of London. It elaborates on the true meaning of the Olympic World Games and reports on the progress of the preparations for this session. This newspaper has specially translated it here.

At 4:00 PM on July 29th this year, the 14th Olympic Games will be declared open by the British monarch. The international friendship generated by athletic competition is of profound and significant meaning. This torch of amateur sports, before the war, shone brilliantly in all nations. This year's "Olympic Torch" will also, like those of ancient times, use a giant magnifying glass on Mount Olympus in northern Greece to concentrate sunlight to ignite the torch. Then, athletes from various countries will relay the torch, passing it on day and night, regardless of wind or rain. On the afternoon of this historic opening day, the torch will arrive at Wembley Stadium in London and light the sacred flame in the stadium—it will burn day and night throughout the competition period. Countless homing pigeons will rise into the air—in ancient Olympic times, they were used to spread the news of the opening to all regions, and even those at war had to stop. Kipling's "Olympic Hymn," conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent's orchestra, will be performed by a large choir. Contingents and other teams from various countries will form a historically significant procession. The greatest sporting festival of the era will be declared open.

Within this, one can find genuine hope and evidence that allows one to believe that the world is not necessarily pessimistic. In this arena where humanity connects and works together, there is, in any case, a genuine basis for mutual understanding among the people of the world.

The various preparations for this session are progressing smoothly. Not only has the government provided assistance, but the majority of sports-loving British people have also made every effort to support it. We have invited sixty countries to participate, and fifty have already accepted the invitation. It is estimated that the total number of athletes from various countries attending this session will reach 6,000. They will compete for the highest honor in seventeen categories of sports.

Seventeen Sports

Track and field, as well as the semi-finals and finals of hockey and soccer, will be held at Wembley Stadium. Steeplechase horse racing will be held at Hurst Park, where you can see the world's best horses jumping. Swimming will be held at the Empire Pool, and boxing, fencing, and gymnastics performances will be held near the pool. The Harringay Arena will be the venue for wrestling, weightlifting, and basketball competitions. Cycling competitions will be held at Herne Hill. Rowing will be contested on the Henley River. The Aldershot Ground will be the venue for shooting, equestrian events, and the pentathlon. Torquay will be the location for speedboat racing. Art competitions are planned to be displayed separately at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

The Organizing Committee has been operating regularly for many months, planning how to use the few venues available due to insufficient labor and building materials to hold all the competitions. Fortunately, with the convenience provided by the Air Ministry, the Ministry of Defense, and the Ministry of Labor, housing to accommodate athletes from various countries has now been completed, and the transportation of athletes to and from the venues has also been planned. Along with the athletes, a large number of spectators will come to visit and sightsee in Britain. The work of preparing appropriate lodging for them has been handled directly by the Travel Association of the Ministry of Trade in consultation with the Hotel Industry Association.

I have read in the newspapers the opinions of one or two people who believe that, given the scarcity of resources, it is better to abandon hosting the World Games, since we cannot entertain our guests as we did before the war. From my perspective, these two gentlemen lack an understanding of the intentions of the audience of the Olympic Games. The audience is certainly aware of the various difficulties we have experienced in promoting the work, but they also know that we must do our best to show the traditional spirit of hospitality. According to the reports of representatives from various countries, they are quite satisfied with our hospitality plan. They are especially moved that our country was ultimately able to complete this arduous task in such difficult national circumstances.

All the World Are Brothers

The audience comes from afar, not to find targets for criticism, but inspired by the spirit of "all the world are brothers" and to appreciate the young elites of various countries competing for the honor of world champions. I believe that after returning to their home countries, the audience will take pride in having been guests at this unprecedented sporting event. International amateur sports will undoubtedly become a bridge connecting the nations of the world. It has an important task to rebuild the mutual trust and understanding that is lacking in the world today.

This World Games is not just a few important world championship finals. The true Olympic spirit of international friendship can be summarized by a famous quote from Baron Coubertin: "The important thing is not to win, but to fight well. The main thing is not to conquer, but to participate."

This session of the World Games will be held in this spirit. At this critical moment in world history, it is a great honor for the United Kingdom, the cradle of amateur sports, to be chosen as the host of the Games.

### No Problem with Rice Supply in This City: Full Rationing to be Implemented Next Month; Price Adjustment for Workers, etc., to 800,000 Yuan per Stone

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau has returned from attending the five-city rationing conference in Beijing and has been busy planning the preparations for rationing in this city in recent days. According to him, full rationing in this city is scheduled to be implemented starting in March. There is no problem with the rice supply, and various procedures are being actively prepared to avoid delays.

Another dispatch: Mr. Ren Xianqun of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, when attending the tea party hosted by Speaker Pan for district chiefs and district people's representatives yesterday, reported to the district chiefs, etc., on the method of allocating and selling rice and stated that the implementation method was determined by considering the interests of citizens, rice shops, rice merchants, and even transportation personnel. The rice allocation was originally scheduled to begin on March 1, but it may be delayed because the numbering is not completed. If the district offices can assist in the numbering, it can be implemented as scheduled.

Another dispatch: The Civil Food Allocation Committee originally calculated the price of rice for industrial workers at 240,000 yuan per stone, but it has now been adjusted to 800,000 yuan per stone because the difference from the market price is too large. The Allocation Committee has already begun issuing rice for January of this year at two dou per person.

### Price Increases in Chengdu Not Yet Subdued; Provincial Government Issues Four Emergency Measures for Strict Prohibition

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Chengdu, 22nd of This Month] The rising prices in Chengdu have not yet been subdued. On the 22nd, the new price of rice was 2,600,000 yuan per double stone. The provincial and municipal governments today issued four emergency measures to strictly prohibit hoarding, report profiteering, dredge grain sources, sell stored grain, and allocate one million stones of overdue grain to prevent rice shortages.

### Wuxi Rice Prices Retreat

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Wuxi, 22nd of This Month] The excessively high prices of rice and paddy in Wuxi City have begun to decline. This is mainly because the weather is clear, arrivals are more abundant, and sales are sluggish. White japonica rice outside the market is 2,160,000 to 2,170,000 yuan, early indica rice is 2,035,000 yuan, yuan rice is 965,000 yuan, a decrease of more than 100,000 yuan. Wheat, however, continues to rise, with a price of 2,850,000 to 2,900,000 yuan, with little change. Soybean oil is 5,040,000 yuan, a decrease of 60,000 yuan. Double Fish yarn is 55,600,000 yuan, an increase of more than 1 million yuan.

### Soaring Prices in Guangzhou

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 22nd of This Month] Financial and commodity prices here continue to rise wildly. The Hong Kong dollar has reached an unprecedented record of 430 from 396. General commodity prices have risen again by more than 10%. The market is extremely chaotic, and people are panicked, awaiting effective suppression by the authorities.

The Guangzhou Financial Management Bureau has actively cracked down on the financial black market. On the 21st, it cracked down on two major black market exchange houses and will continue to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the city's banking industry. In addition to the Central Bank raising interbank deposit rates, it has also released a large amount of cotton yarn. However, the city's credit remains very loose and excessive.

### Sharp Price Drop in Baoding

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Baoding, 22nd of This Month] Commodity prices in Baoding have been falling sharply in recent days. Grain is being transported from the suburbs, and the Ping-Bao Highway is clear. Coal is also being transported in large quantities. Flour has fallen by 250,000 yuan per bag and is now selling for 1,300,000 yuan. Cloth and daily necessities have also fallen.

### Flower and Yarn Cloth Management Committee Establishes Office in Guangzhou

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 22nd of This Month] The Ministry of Economic Affairs believes that Guangdong and Guangzhou have a great need for yarn and cloth. After the restriction on southward transportation, South China weavers have been greatly affected. In order to develop the South China textile and dyeing industry, the restriction on transportation has been lifted, and a branch office of the Flower and Yarn Cloth Management Committee has been established in Guangzhou, with Lü Gu'er as the director, to manage the transportation of flower and yarn cloth.

### Seized Yarn and Cloth Should Be Returned to Merchants and Citizens

Shen Shihao Earnestly States Reasons

During the occupation period, the puppet Merchants' Association forcibly purchased yarn and cloth stored by merchants and citizens. Among them, members of the three trade associations of the dyeing and weaving industry, cotton cloth commerce, and cotton yarn commerce were forced to sell more than 200,000 pieces of yarn and cloth. Although the puppet Merchants' Association stipulated that the purchased yarn and cloth would be paid for in gold and cash, the purchase price was vastly different from the market price. Merchants and citizens have suffered greatly. Moreover, after paying part of the gold, the puppet Merchants' Association did not have time to pay the cash before it collapsed with the surrender of the Japanese.

According to Pan Shihao, the chairman of the Dyeing and Weaving Trade Association, "I have been fully promoting the matter of returning the seized yarn and cloth since the victory. I once drafted an article entitled 'Should the Seized Yarn and Cloth Be Returned?' to arouse the attention of the government and the public. However, the government has not taken any active measures, which is regrettable." In terms of legal principles, "all treaties and contracts signed under duress are invalid. The puppet Merchants' Association called it a purchase, but in reality, it was a plunder carried out in a high-handed manner, as everyone knows. After the victory, the government took over the remaining materials of the puppet Merchants' Association. The ownership is very clear. The remaining yarn and cloth should be returned to the affected merchants and citizens, without the need for further explanation," and so on. It is reported that there are more than 10,000 pieces of cotton yarn and 40,000 pieces of cotton cloth, or more than 1,600,000 bolts of cloth, seized.

### Borneo Timber Shipped to Shanghai

The forests of Sumatra, Borneo, and New Guinea have countless varieties of trees. A few days ago, a batch of Lauan timber from Borneo arrived in this city. The quality is excellent, comparable to Lauan from the Philippines. This cargo was loaded by the Java Shoulin Company, and the Shanghai representative is Shi Shouhou. In terms of transportation, the British Jingyi Timber Company and the Dutch Java Mail Line contributed the most.

### Central Trust Bureau Announces Tung Oil and Bristle Market Conditions

The Central Trust Bureau reported yesterday on the domestic and foreign tung oil and bristle market conditions this week as follows:

The international tung oil price is sluggish because the U.S. government is investigating the sales situation of Chinese tung oil to the U.S. and has not yet announced the results. Importers and manufacturers are afraid to import goods. Moreover, some importers are trying to take the opportunity to lower prices and profit from it. Our exporters are aware of their tricks and have unanimously decided not to compete for sales to avoid affecting prices. The government is reportedly also planning to take measures to stabilize the international tung oil price in the near future. Therefore, although the tung oil price was once in a precarious situation, it has now turned around slightly. The New York spot price is still US$0.245 per pound. The Hong Kong price is US$0.235 per pound C&F New York. The London price for barrelled oil is £176 per long ton CIF.

Domestic oil prices are 4,000,000 yuan per shi dan in Shanghai, 2,360,000 yuan in Chongqing, 3,420,000 yuan in Hankou, 3,350,000 yuan in Wuzhou, and 3,508,000 yuan in Guangzhou.

The international bristle price is stable. Only Shanghai bristles are slightly softer. Chongqing No. 27 black bristles are priced at US$2.20 per pound CF&New York. Hankou No. 17 black bristles are US$3.05. Shanghai No. 17 black bristles are US$2.10. Tianjin small No. 55 black bristles are US$4.80. There have been some transactions.

Domestic prices for Shanghai bristles are 4,000,000 yuan per guan dan, which is slightly lower than before the Lunar New Year. However, the U.S. dollar exchange rate has risen by 10% on the 20th, so prices are likely to rise slightly. In Chongqing, Hankou, Tianjin, and other places, the market has not fully recovered as the Lunar New Year has just passed.

### Comparison of Chinese and Japanese Raw Silk Exports

— Chen Quan

Raw silk is a major export commodity of our country. Before 1908, it occupied the leading position in the international raw silk market. At that time, the Japanese silk industry was not yet fully developed. Japanese raw silk began to be sold abroad in 1880. The export quantity in that year was only 8,840 piculs, while China's export quantity was 49,321 piculs. However, the development of the Japanese silk industry gradually became a strong competitor to China's raw silk exports. Since 1909, the export quantity of Japanese raw silk has increased year by year, far exceeding that of our country. Its position in the international market has also become increasingly important, while China has lagged behind. From 1880 to 1946, the lowest amount of raw silk exported from China was 49,321 piculs, and the highest amount was 114,894 piculs; while Japan increased from 8,840 piculs to 351,352 piculs. The speed of its progress makes people feel insignificant in comparison. According to the Shenbao Yearbook, the national raw silk production in China during the 15th and 16th years of the Republic of China was estimated to be about 252,000 guan dan; and the export figures from the 14th to the 18th years of the Republic of China were around 200,000 piculs (including waste silk). Domestic sales were estimated to be 60,000 piculs. Therefore, the national production, including waste silk, should be more than 250,000 piculs. The above estimate of 252,000 guan dan should be calculated excluding waste silk. By the 21st year, the production sharply decreased due to the impact of the silk industry panic. Since then, the export figures have been only about 40% of those from the 17th and 18th years; while Japan's raw silk exports during this period were making rapid progress.

The average quantity of raw silk exported from China in the ten years before the war was more than 70,000 piculs. In the ten years, the highest export quantity was more than 114,000 piculs; the price dropped from more than 2,000 yuan per dan in the 16th and 17th years to more than 700 yuan in the 23rd year. By the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, it rose to more than 1,100 yuan. The ten-year average was 1,638 yuan. The average quantity of waste silk exported in the ten years was more than 61,000 piculs. The highest export quantity in the ten years was more than 96,000 piculs. Compared to raw silk, the difference was only a little more than 10%. The price once dropped from more than 210 yuan per dan in the 18th year to 70 yuan. The ten-year average was 149 yuan. After the war, China's raw silk exports were sluggish due to increased domestic costs and occasional declines in international market prices. In the 35th year, the export of various types of raw silk from China was about 8,500 piculs; the average price was about 3,500,000 yuan per dan. In addition, about 7,500 piculs of waste silk were exported. The average price was about 275,000 yuan. Comparing the export quantity with the pre-war quantity and the pre-war currency value, the extent of its decline can be seen.

As for the exporting countries, the United States ranks first. The United States has a larger consumption of raw silk than other countries. Therefore, if we can grasp the U.S. market, we can be successful in raw silk export trade. However, compared with the past situation of raw silk exports to the United States, it is worrying. In the years from 1926 to 1935, the U.S. raw silk consumption accounted for 15% of the world's raw silk consumption, about 700,000 dan per year. Most of them were Japanese silk, and Chinese raw silk accounted for only a small part. The situation after the war is also not optimistic. The analysis is as follows:

In the period from 1891 to 1941, the proportion of Japanese raw silk exports to the United States in the total amount of raw silk imported by the United States gradually increased, from about 50% to about 90%. The highest amount reached 97% (such as in 1934). After 1921, except for the period from 1921 to 1923, Japanese raw silk sales in the United States accounted for more than 80% of the total amount of raw silk imported by the United States, occupying a very superior position.

During this period, the proportion of Chinese raw silk was always at a disadvantage. Although it reached 25% from 1895 to 1897, it gradually decreased afterward. Since 1931, except for 1940 and 1941, when it exceeded 10%, the remaining years were all below 10%. In 1934 and 1938, it even decreased to 2%. The statistics of raw silk exports from China and Japan to the United States from 1921 to 1941 are listed in the table below. The above is the general situation before the war and in the early stage of the Anti-Japanese War. As for the situation after the war, there are also many concerns. In the past, China's raw silk exports were unable to find a way out due to the oppression of the development of the Japanese silk industry. Domestic people all believed that Japan had suffered war losses after the war and would not be easy to recover for a while. Its silk industry would be no exception. China can take this opportunity to seize the U.S. market and replace Japan's raw silk position. However, the actual situation is just the opposite. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce statistics, in the first eleven months of 1946, China's raw silk exports to the United States were 11,500 bales, about one-seventh of the quantity of Chinese raw silk exported to the United States in the same period of 1939. On the other hand, the Japanese raw silk industry is in a much better situation than China.

After the war, Japan lost its original colonies, so the food needed domestically had to rely on imports from foreign countries, and the quantity was very large. If the food problem cannot be solved, it will be difficult to ensure the stability and security of Japan. The U.S. military authorities stationed in Japan, in order to solve this serious problem, planned to import food and other necessities on behalf of Japan. Therefore, they went on to raise foreign exchange to pay for the import of food. As a result, they adopted a policy of supporting Japanese raw silk exports: and the Japanese raw silk industry, under the maintenance of the occupying authorities, has been flourishing again, and the U.S. market is the main market. As for the mode of operation and export, it is presided over by the Trade Bureau established by the Japanese government, which purchases raw silk from the people in Japanese currency and transfers it to the U.S. occupying authorities. Then, the American Commercial Company affiliated to the American Reconstruction Finance Corporation determines the selling price according to the market situation. For this reason, the selling price of Japanese raw silk in the U.S. market is not related to its production cost. Even if its domestic production cost increases, it will not affect the export of raw silk.

### The Struggle for Uranium

— Qiang Hua

As everyone knows, uranium is an essential raw material for manufacturing atomic energy. Moreover, in this day and age when atomic bombs are not yet subject to international control, everyone believes that whoever obtains more uranium obtains a greater guarantee of national security. In particular, the United States and the Soviet Union, with their keen sense of security, are engaged in a struggle for uranium.

What is the current situation? To what extent have the two sides progressed? To answer these questions, let us list the world's major uranium-producing areas and point out the state of supply of each uranium mine.

The United States can purchase uranium ore from the following places:

The Belgian Congo produces the most uranium. According to a report by the United Press, geologists estimate that this region contains 70 percent of the world's known uranium reserves. The fact that all of its production is supplied to the United States has become a heated political debate in the Belgian parliament. The Belgian government is unwilling to disclose the total production figures. Recently, the New York Herald Tribune reported that studies from reliable sources show that 2,000 tons of ore sand were produced in 1946, and 1,600 tons were produced in the first three months of 1947.

Communists and leftists in the Belgian parliament claim that the price paid by the United States is "ridiculously" low, and that American uranium ore experts simply treat Belgium as a "colony." Prime Minister Paul-Henri Spaak replied that the wartime agreement with the United States is still in effect and must remain in place until the United Nations decides to abolish it.

The Great Bear Lake area in the Northwest Territories of Canada is the second richest in uranium production. In fact, all of its production is also supplied to the United States. However, the tonnage figures are unknown. Canada retains a small portion of the mined ore sand near Chalk River for its own use in manufacturing atomic energy.

Colorado in the United States proper has recently stepped into a prominent position in uranium production. It is reported that the uranium treasure in this area is so abundant that Americans do not have to rely on foreign sources.

While the United States is concentrating its efforts on buying up uranium mines in every corner of the world, the Soviet Union is also engaged in developing its own domestic treasures. Because the Soviet Union occupies one-sixth of the Earth's land area, the idea that the Soviet Union can produce enough uranium for its own needs is not a problem.

This year, the largest prospecting campaign in Soviet history has begun. According to a Moscow dispatch from the Washington Post, this prospecting work includes 150 aircraft, 3,000 motorcycles, and 6,000 horse-drawn carts engaged in this task. Although the Soviet Union has so far kept the results of the exploration a secret, some facts are already well known. For example, South Turkestan, the Ural Mountains, Lake Baikal in the Far East, and many other places within Soviet territory all have many uranium ore deposits.

A recent United Press dispatch also said that Dr. Bamke, a famous German atomic energy scientist, has agreed to conduct atomic energy research jointly with Dr. Peter Kapitza, a world-renowned Soviet physicist. According to Dr. Bamke, the uranium that the Soviet Union may have obtained from South Turkestan has been used to make several experimental atomic bombs.

In addition, uranium ore is said to have been discovered in Soviet-occupied Europe. For example, some reports say that uranium ore has been discovered in the Erz Mountains, but Dr. Bamke said that the German government also searched for uranium there from 1940 to 1945 without success. However, news continues to spread that this area has been forbidden to enter or leave at will. According to a United Press dispatch, German geologist Dr. Walter Lutz once said that the area contains the only known large uranium deposit in Europe. Other unconfirmed reports say that 100,000 Soviet and German people are engaged in uranium mining along the German-Czech border. The Jachymov mine in the Czech Republic is known for containing abundant uranium. In fact, Madame Curie first discovered uranium by refining it from two tons of pitchblende obtained from this location. The Czech government says that it has no intention of conducting atomic research and that there are currently no mined uranium ores available for export, but the Czech Republic is clearly under Soviet control.

In addition to the United States and the Soviet Union, many neutral countries also have uranium deposits, but the ore deposits cannot yet be sold.

France is one such country. It has uranium ore in its own country and on the island of Madagascar, but its domestic atomic energy researchers are searching throughout French territory. Dr. Kwath, technical director of French atomic energy work, said that 60 to 70 personnel are engaged in this work.

It is widely rumored that Sweden contains a lot of uranium ore, mixed in shale rock. The Swedish government began drilling oil wells domestically during the war due to the interruption of coal and kerosene imports, and it was then that uranium ore was discovered.

In January of last year, Dr. Guotav Egloff, chairman of the Petroleum Division of the American Chemical Society, said upon returning from an inspection in Sweden that their radioactive ore shale contains about 200,000 tons of uranium ore.

Several days later, the authoritative British science journal Nature reported that Sweden had organized a Swedish Atomic Energy Commission and designed a plan for an experimental atomic energy manufacturing plant.

Norway and Argentina have both discovered uranium, and Norway has also established an atomic energy commission.

South Australia is also said to have considerable uranium ore, enough to supply current power for one hundred years.

Mexico, Brazil, New Zealand, and many other countries have all claimed to have discovered uranium ore within their borders. In addition, Travancore, India, is famous for producing thorium. Recently, the United Kingdom and Chile and Argentina fought for sovereignty over the Falkland Islands because of uranium ore.

In the future, the scientific community may find many minerals to be used as raw materials for atomic energy. However, so far, there is only one material in nature that is suitable for this purpose, namely U-235 in uranium. However, U-233 can be extracted from thorium. The main thorium deposit is in France.

This ore in France caused one of the most feared problems for the Allies in World War II because they were deeply afraid that Germany would use it.

It is said that there is uranium ore in Xinjiang, China, and there is also uranium ore in Guangxi, which is being prepared for surveying.

Although this struggle is just beginning, every country knows the value and importance of uranium. The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission has also agreed on the principle of only allowing the use of atomic energy in peacetime, but the struggle for uranium continues unabated.

### The Contribution of Atomic Energy in Peacetime

— Translated by Qu Sou

Considering the above-mentioned technical and economic points, our conclusion is that the use of atomic energy to generate power can become a secondary source of power in generally industrialized home countries; but even if current fuel prices rise by another 50 percent, uranium will still not become the primary energy source.

Using uranium to generate power will have a great impact on workers, especially coal miners. If current coal prices continue to rise, then some large factories will have to be forced to use uranium as a power source. In this way, general coal mining companies will have to do their best to increase production, and on the other hand, coal can also be converted to other more reasonable uses.

When wages in a certain industry are too high, thereby increasing the price of the product, people will adopt other substitutes or alternative methods that have always been considered too expensive. After the invention of the diesel engine, the electrification of trains was therefore halted. And in the printing industry, every time workers demand wage increases, it promotes a new printing method, such as typesetting machines, automatic typesetting machines, stereotype machines, and faster printing machines. If mankind can have better methods of breaking atoms and better methods of using atomic energy than today, that would be a blessing, because it is a sin for mankind to use coal and oil as fuel now; these two things should be used as raw materials for the chemical industry, not as fuel. From these raw materials, we can manufacture developing chemicals for photography, medicinal drugs for treating diseases, and artificial perfumes, essences, and artificial dyes that can rival natural products; but now these large amounts of raw materials are all burned by us. Only after mankind reaches the age of using atomic energy can we fully utilize these raw materials.

The price of fuel will be the main factor in determining when and where atomic energy plants can be built. Therefore, countries like Brazil will be able to become major powers in the atomic age. Brazil is rich in iron ore sand and manganese, but lacks coal, but has a lot of thorium, which is another radioactive element that can be used to generate power in the same way as uranium. Therefore, Brazil can become a country with a highly developed steel industry. On the other hand, there is very little possibility of using atomic energy on islands in the tropics. Because in this circle near the equator, although fuel is not abundant, there is a lot of sunlight, and using the heat and energy of sunlight is of course the cheapest and most beneficial thing.

Uranium has great explosive power after being impacted, and some people call it atomic explosives. Therefore, people ask whether uranium can be used when excavating canals, digging tunnels, or digging foundations. This is also a question worth considering. What needs the most attention, of course, is radiation.

Using radioactive isotopes, doctors can observe various conditions in living organisms. At the National Institutes of Health in the United States, scientists are now able to attach radioactive metals to bacterial bodies, so they can observe how bacteria fight against antitoxins produced in the body. Tobacco mosaic virus can now be attached firmly for observation purposes, and there is hope that other viruses such as influenza and polio can also do this.

Some radioactive and selective isotopes have been used to treat cancer. After these isotopes are injected into the human body, they will cause the malignant part to glow without affecting the healthy part, and then gradually fade away after several days.

This is not a figment of the imagination or an exaggeration. The University of California in the United States has discovered several elements and compounds with short-term radioactivity that also have the above-mentioned selectivity. Therefore, it is possible to use radioactive calcium to treat cancer.

At the Barnard Free Skin and Cancer Hospital in St. Louis, USA, the use of radioactive elements has enabled doctors to have greater success in treating congestive heart failure. Leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and various cancers can all be treated with radioactive gold. Radioactive elements can also be attached to red blood cells, passing through the entire human body, allowing doctors to have a deeper understanding of coronary thrombosis. Using radioactive iron can tell us the rate at which red blood cells are produced in a person's body and how the human body absorbs and utilizes iron, so doctors will be more confident in treating anemia. In addition, radioactive elements can be attached to penicillin and other drugs, so soon, the medical community will know how these drugs kill or inhibit germs. In terms of plants, Dr. Bull of Honolulu used radioactive carbon dioxide and learned about the radioactive sugar content in sugarcane.

Some isotopes cannot be obtained in atomic energy plants, so they still have to rely on atomic smashers. But now most isotopes can be obtained in large quantities, so previously only a few scientists could do research in this area, but in the future, a large number of people can study the metabolism and other phenomena in living organisms in biology and physiology.

Therefore, after using atomic energy, we will not have an industrial and social revolution, but may have a great revolution in biology and physiology. Isotopes produced after atomic impact, although have absolutely nothing to do with the process of manufacturing atomic bombs, are the most important research tools discovered by mankind in hundreds of years. In the atomic energy plant, we can also use appropriate buildings to defend against this radioactivity, but if uranium is used to explode in mountains and rocks, then the emitted radioactivity will be attached to the scattered rocks. The land where the first atomic bomb was tested in New Mexico, USA, in 1945 was still radioactive several weeks later; the warships used as targets in Bikini Atoll were still radioactive several months after the test. When we dig a tunnel, using a small amount of uranium may be more effective than using other explosives, but these scattered rocks may not be removed until a year later, so engineers will still use the old methods instead of using uranium. As for the mining of gold, silver, copper and other metal mines, it is even more inappropriate to use atomic energy. It is only on the machines that mine rock mountains that the use of atomic energy is more possible.

Radioactivity is the biggest obstacle preventing mankind from using atomic energy immediately, but it also gives mankind great help. Uranium 235 is no longer uranium after being broken, but produces zinc and Krypton (a rare gas), carbon, or other elements, and these products are radioactive, with a time ranging from several seconds to several months. These radioactive elements are called "isotopes." Isotopes are elements in the same position on the atomic number table, but their actual weight is different from the original elements. The lightest element on the atomic number table is hydrogen, and the heaviest is uranium. There are many variants between them, such as hydrogen has three types, namely hydrogen 1, hydrogen 2, and hydrogen 3. In addition, elements such as lead and carbon also have isotopes. They have different weights and different abilities to carry radioactivity. Isotopes have been obtained in atomic smashers many years before being made into atomic bombs, but the isotopes produced in a pile after being impacted are cheap and have large quantities, so they are excellent sources. For example, if we feed a mouse with fat containing heavy hydrogen, then we can find out which part of its body stores hydrogen and how the body uses it. Fat containing heavy hydrogen weighs differently from fat containing ordinary hydrogen, so it is easy to distinguish. From this method, scientists have discovered that previous human assumptions about how the body consumes fat were wrong. After using nitrogen isotopes as a tracer, we have also gained much knowledge about how the human body absorbs proteins (which contain nitrogen) and turns them into part of the body.

Radioactive isotopes from Oak Ridge have become a very popular gift. Radioactive iodine can treat various disorders of the thyroid gland. Previously, when obtained from atomic smashers, this iodine cost $1,600 per dose, but now it only costs a few dollars from Oak Ridge. Radioactive phosphorus used to cost $2 per unit, but now it only costs 32 cents.

Under the study of radioactive isotopes, medicine, biology, agriculture, physics, and chemistry will all have new developments, and even metallurgy and industry will indirectly benefit and make progress. (Mankind will be able to manufacture metals several times harder than today's metals). Therefore, when discussing the use of atomic energy, the greatest benefits may still be the by-products of smashing atoms.

President Truman of the United States declared at the International Cancer Research Conference that radioactive isotopes will soon be exported from the United States for research by the biological and medical circles of various countries around the world. Although this move has absolutely no impact on the US-Soviet atomic energy control issue, it greatly helps restore the free exchange of scientific knowledge between countries and can break the selfish attitude of self-isolation that has prevailed in the scientific circles of various countries in the past few years.

### Sex Determination of Clonal Offspring (Continued)

— Xie Yiying

(B) Diploid parthenogenesis

Like aphids, rotifers, scale insects, spider mites, stick insects, etc., their eggs that undergo parthenogenesis do not undergo meiosis and generally have diploid chromosome numbers. In detail, the offspring of this type of parthenogenesis have the same number of chromosomes in each cell as the mother, so it is no wonder that they are all female. However, in fact, diploid parthenogenesis does not necessarily all produce female offspring. Some types of animals can produce both female and male offspring, which is truly a miracle of biology. For the sake of explanation and record, let us give examples to illustrate the two categories of diploid female parthenogenesis and diploid dioecious parthenogenesis:

(A) Diploid female parthenogenesis: Some species of animals seem to only undergo parthenogenesis throughout their lives, and their offspring are all female, with no males to be seen. For example, scale insects that parasitize the stems and leaves of plants have a lifestyle that is quite similar to that of aphids. Among them, there are many species that specialize in parthenogenesis to reproduce their offspring. Belloidse in rotifers are all composed of females, and males have not been found to this day. They also specialize in parthenogenesis to reproduce their offspring. Clonopsigalliea, an insect of the order Orthoptera, which is commonly found in Europe, also has only females. Solenobis usually has only females. All such animals that usually only have females produce female offspring as a result of parthenogenesis. The reason for this is that the mature eggs in the mother's body have not undergone meiosis. The offspring have the same amount of chromosomes as the mother, so the offspring that develop should naturally be female.

A more peculiar example is aphids. In the annual life history of aphids, there are generations that engage in parthenogenesis and generations that engage in sexual reproduction. These two generations alternate. Their parthenogenesis can be regarded as a representative of female parthenogenesis, and can also be regarded as a representative of dioecious parthenogenesis. The following is a brief description of their life history in a year:

The aphids found in early spring are all wingless female insects that engage in parthenogenesis (Parthenogenetic female). After the female insects grow up, they immediately engage in parthenogenesis, and produce female offspring by viviparity from eggs that have not undergone meiosis. The female offspring grow up and become mothers, and then engage in parthenogenesis again and give birth to female offspring by viviparity (representing diploid female parthenogenesis). This continues for several generations, until the last generation of mothers in autumn, whose eggs may or may not undergo meiosis, and thus become winged dioecious female insects (Bisexual female). Dioecious female insects do not have both male and female sexes themselves, but rather refer to the fact that the eggs produced by this type of female insect are prepared to be combined with sperm for sexual reproduction. These eggs have all undergone meiosis, so the mature eggs only contain a haploid (n) number of chromosomes. If the eggs of the last generation of mothers in autumn only reduce one or two chromosomes, so that the mature eggs become n-1 (2), then this type of egg will develop into male offspring (representing diploid dioecious parthenogenesis). The germ cells produced by the male offspring, after meiosis, produce two types of sperm, one containing n chromosomes and the other containing n-1 (2) chromosomes. Only sperm containing n chromosomes can combine with eggs. (Sperm containing n-1 (2) will eventually degenerate) to become fertilized eggs to overwinter, and until the next spring, they will develop into mother insects again and engage in parthenogenesis (Note 3). The following is a table of their life history in a year: (See Figure 1)

From the above table, it can be seen that the parthenogenesis of aphids in spring is actually diploid female parthenogenesis, while the parthenogenesis of the last generation after entering autumn is dioecious parthenogenesis. After this generation, it enters the generation of sexual reproduction. The fertilized eggs overwinter until the next spring and develop into mother insects that engage in parthenogenesis again.

The following will further discuss diploid dioecious parthenogenesis.

(b) Diploid dioecious parthenogenesis: In addition to the above-mentioned aphids (Figure 1), the same situation has also been found in grape phylloxera. According to reports by Baehr and Morgan, the reason for the occurrence of dioecious offspring is as follows:

Baehr (1908-1909) studied a species of aphid called Aphis saliceti, and found that cells that develop into females have 6 chromosomes, while cells that develop into males have only 5 chromosomes.

Morgan (1908-1909) also obtained similar facts in his study of a species of grape phylloxera called Phylloxera carydedoauois. Female offspring cells have 6 chromosomes, while male offspring cells have only 5. The parental body of the female grape phylloxera that originally engaged in parthenogenesis does not undergo meiosis when the eggs it produces mature and divide, so the eggs produced for female offspring still have 6 chromosomes. However, the eggs that develop into male offspring are not only slightly smaller in appearance, but also have an X chromosome discharged between the polar body and the egg during maturation and division, resulting in only 5 chromosomes remaining in the egg, so it develops into a male body. This is exactly in line with the principle of X chromosome determining sex. The reproduction cycle and chromosome changes are as follows: (See Figure 2)

In the above table, "A" represents ordinary chromosomes, and X represents sex chromosomes.

(C) Alternately Haploid and Diploid parthenogenesis

Animals like rotifers not only alternate between parthenogenesis and sexual reproduction, but their parthenogenesis is sometimes diploid and sometimes haploid. When the chromosome is diploid, the offspring that develop will be female, and when the chromosome is haploid, the offspring that develop will be male. The parthenogenesis of haploid and diploid chromosomes alternates, so the offspring are either male or female. Rotifers engage in parthenogenesis when the environment is suitable, and the eggs they produce do not undergo meiosis and develop into female offspring. When the environment is suitable, all the eggs produced undergo meiosis, so they only contain half the number of chromosomes. If these eggs are fertilized, they become fertilized eggs containing diploid chromosomes and develop into female rotifers. If the eggs containing half the number of chromosomes develop independently without fertilization, they will all become male rotifers. Because the parthenogenesis of rotifers and other animals has both haploid and diploid types, and it alternates, it can only be listed as a separate category, called alternately haploid and diploid parthenogenesis.

### Sorrow Greater Than a Dead Heart

— Jingwen

In my previous short essay, "Life and Culture," I only proposed that we should use a new way of life to reform social customs, hoping to enrich the culture of life and give our country and nation new blood and new life. However, it was written too abstractly, and now I want to supplement some meanings.

The decline of social customs and the widespread psychological depression of the people today are undeniable facts. However, opinions on practical matters differ. For example, some people who advocate reforming social customs believe that dancing is a decadent behavior and should be banned. I personally have no opinion on this, because I have no connection with it and am not interested in it. But I think the social issues that deserve attention today are really not trivial issues such as banning dancing or prostitution.

Behaviors like dancing may lead some who are lost in pleasure to a state of spiritual numbness, but dancing itself is not a sinful behavior. What is considered sinful is only the result of an unsound society itself.

As the saying goes, "There is no sorrow greater than a dead heart." I personally believe that the most serious social phenomenon today is the low morale of the people. The biggest sign of this is that there is only self-interest and no sense of right and wrong between people. This manifests itself in selfish, irresponsible, and insatiable greed in life. Countless examples can be cited in the fields of industry, agriculture, commerce, and academia.

For example, education is a sacred cause. In high-level universities in Europe and the United States, it is equivalent to the spiritual fortress of the country and nation. Even small schools in remote areas are the center of the spiritual life of the local people. Schools not only educate students but also guide the people. In the past, our private schools in the countryside could still gain the respect of the villagers, but since the advent of the so-called "school stores," culture has long been swept away, and the relationship between students and schools is only a transactional one. The high cost may be due to the living environment and is still understandable, but what is sad is the lack of qualified teachers and the absence of educational policies. Although there are still many responsible teachers, there are more who are unqualified. What is especially frightening is the decline of the teaching profession. For example, the incident in Nanshi last year in which the principal of a primary school raped an underage female student proves the terrible extent of the decline of the teaching profession.

I will stop here for now. Anyway, what I can see, everyone has already become accustomed to, but what is frightening is precisely that everyone has become accustomed to it, taking it for granted, and is already psychologically numb. The social symptoms of today are precisely in this.

What I said above may be a bit too serious, but it is not to say that it is hopeless, because although the situation is bleak, it is not yet desperate. The treatment methods for mental paralysis by psychiatrists are nothing more than advising patients to change to a fresh environment, and also to take some stimulants. This is the same for social spiritual paralysis. The only difference is that patients with mental paralysis only need to change their environment, while for social spiritual paralysis, it is necessary to create a new living environment.

Although words cannot fully express my meaning, my intention in writing this article is sincere.

### The Lantern Market in Beiping

— Liu Yansheng

During the Spring Festival, various places traditionally celebrate the New Year by lighting lanterns due to customs. We see in "Water Margin" that when Song Jiang attacked Daming Prefecture, Shi Qian set fire to the Cuiyun Tower. During the Lantern Festival in Daming Prefecture, two mountain-shaped lantern displays were set up, with lanterns lit up at night, fully demonstrating the idea of sharing joy with the people. This is the lantern market.

The lantern markets in various places are not quite the same. Speaking of the Beiping lantern market, it has a long history, and there are written records in various dynasties. To put it briefly, the lantern market started in the Han Dynasty, and flourished in the Ming Dynasty. Liu Tong's "A Brief Account of Objects and Scenery in the Imperial Capital" describes it in detail. Hong Rongzhai's "Rongzhai's Miscellaneous Writings" also has a section on "Lighting Lanterns on the Lantern Festival," explaining that the lantern market originated in the Han Dynasty, and also explaining that since the Song Dynasty, due to various reasons, it was changed to five nights, and later increased to seven nights. Such a comprehensive and detailed seasonal routine event has great folk power. Meng Yuanlao's "Tokyo Dream Record" and Zhou Bida's "Pingyuan Sequel" both describe the origin of the lantern market and the real prosperity of the time. According to records in "Youlan Zhi in Yandu" and "Anecdotes Heard Near the Capital" about the lantern market in Beiping, we can know that the lantern market was originally a prosperous event during the Spring Festival in Beiping, and the location of the lantern market was not the same, not in one place. "Youlan Zhi" says: "The lantern market is located in the east of Wangfu Street, Donghua Gate, and the west of Chongwen Street, spanning more than two li. On both sides are tall buildings, with lanterns lit on them at night, looking like a windy street." According to "Anecdotes Heard Near the Capital": "Every Lantern Festival, on the five nights, in the east of Xima Market and under the Dongsi Archway, there are several lantern sheds, and each store hangs colorful lantern balls, like pearls and jade, like colorful clouds, or interspersed with various colored gauze lanterns. From the lantern market to the east to Dongsi Archway, they are connected continuously. Every time the new moon rises, the street dust does not rise, scholars and women gather, and children cheer." As for the appearance of the lanterns in the lantern market, the "Customs of the Capital" has a detailed record, such as: "The lanterns have various styles, such as large, small, tall, short, long, round, square, etc. There are gauze paper, glass, sheep horn, and Western styles. The painted figures include the states, the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West, Investiture of the Gods, Water Margin, Strange Tales, etc. The flowers include orchids, chrysanthemums, plums, osmanthus, daylilies, bamboo, peonies, etc. The birds and animals include phoenixes, dragons, tigers, horses, cows, chickens, dogs, fish, shrimps, insects, ants, etc. The colors are bright and beautiful, and the postures are lifelike. There are many varieties, which are difficult to list. The most peculiar are the ice lanterns, which are carved from ice into figures, flowers, birds, insects, fish, etc. The ice is solidified, and it does not melt for a long time. The carvings are exquisite, and the viewers appreciate them." Such ingenious and various lanterns, hung on the streets, are indeed like Bai Juyi's poem, describing "lanterns and lights in every house in the market, singing and music in every building," no wonder "who can sit idly when they see them, where can they hear the lanterns and not come to see them"!

The location of the Beiping lantern market, as mentioned in the "Youlan Zhi in Yandu," is in the east of Wangfu Street, Donghua Gate, Beiping. Chu Baishi's "Renhai Ji" also says it is outside the "Donghua Gate" in the inner city. This place is now "Dengshikou." Although the lantern market has been abandoned for a long time, and the lanterns have been moved to other places, the name of Dengshikou still exists, and it is clear that it was the location of the lantern market in the Ming Dynasty. In the Qing Dynasty, the lantern market was almost moved outside Qianmen. According to "Shuicao Qingxia Lu": "In recent years, the only places with something worth seeing are the major stores outside Qianmen, and the silk and satin shops and ginseng shops on Xiheyan Street, and the Diamochang, and the east and west Jiangmi alleys." This situation still exists every year, but the lanterns are simpler or more elaborate. The existing ones, such as the Three Kingdoms lantern paintings of Ruifuxiang in Dashilan outside Qianmen, the Water Margin of Donghongji and Xihongji, and the lanterns in the various lantern painting shops in Langfang Toutiao, can all attract tourists to stop and watch. The painted figures and landscapes are particularly delicate. Outside Qianmen, there are also the wheat lanterns and ice lanterns displayed in Xiaomen Jiangdian outside Di'anmen, which are also a temporary spectacle. In the early years, when people watched lanterns during the Lantern Festival in Beiping, many jokes were discovered due to the crowds, all made by people in the market taking advantage of the chaos. Since the Republic of China, the lantern market has not been banned, but many items are lost every year, which is a special embellishment of the Spring Festival in Beiping.

This year, due to the price relationship in Beiping, it is probably impossible to see many specially hung lanterns, but only the existing ones are routinely hung to decorate them. If we seek the prosperity of the past, it is no longer possible to get it. The "Shihu Yuefu" has a long poem about the lantern market, with a sentence saying: "Yantai is a prosperous place in ancient and modern times, and I especially love the lantern shadow play on the Lantern Festival. Before spring and after winter, the weather is fine, and the lantern market has already been set up on the street." Such records and descriptions are already historical traces.

### A Sense of Loss

— Jinjin

The things in the world that can move people are not necessarily the explosion of an atomic bomb, love stories that exhaust all the joys and sorrows of parting and reunion, or unexpected luck such as winning the lottery in a charity house purchase. Sometimes, small details in daily life can also make people feel a sense of loss.

Even now, a vivid picture remains in my mind. It was the morning of the second day after Christmas last year, at most around 6:30 a.m., because I liked to get up early and go out. As I crossed the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road, I saw a cleaner in red clothes pushing a garbage truck coming towards me. On top of the garbage truck, incongruously lying was a neatly trimmed Christmas tree. The gold-sprinkled paper strips and other decorations were still shining in the dim morning light. But its fate was already to be mixed with garbage and waste. As the saying goes, "When a pearl gets old and yellow, it's worthless." Looking at this Christmas tree, the pearl doesn't need to turn "yellow." As long as its owner has another love, its end is in sight.

Another time, let's go back more than ten years. I was still in middle school. Because I had a habit of getting up early since I was a child, on a certain snowy morning, I went out around six o'clock as well. The street was a white expanse, and the accumulated snow completely covered the asphalt road and the pebble street. Therefore, the footprints left on the snow were particularly distinct, sparse, and it happened to show that someone had walked on this street before me. On such a cold morning, the wind in the face was as sharp as a knife. Who would be willing to leave the warm bed and run around outside? Leaving me aside at the time, it seems quite puzzling except for those who have to run around for food and clothing, but it can just reflect the severity of the pressure of life.

Generally speaking, any occasion that reveals true feelings can arouse our resonance. When we lack this kind of experience in our real life, we can also experience many touching scenes in realistic novels and movies. I think anyone who has read "Les Misérables" must be inspired by the great personality of the protagonist Jean Valjean, who sacrificed himself and dedicated himself to the people. And when a tragedy develops to its climax, at least many female audience members wet their little handkerchiefs. As far as I am concerned, I saw Li Lihua playing the roles of mother and daughter in "Autumn Begonia" a few years ago. After their reunion, the daughter saw her mother coming slowly from a dressing mirror, as if it were an illusion. Another example is in "Waterloo Bridge," when Robert Taylor returned from the war and met Vivien Leigh at the station. At this time, the latter already had an unspeakable sad history. She was full of words, but she didn't know where to start. These two scenes couldn't help but make me feel sad.

### Extraordinary

— Yun Gong

One of humanity's fundamental desires, according to an analysis by Dr. Ivan, a professor at the University of Southern California, is to be "Above the average." To translate it into a more Chinese way, it is to be "Extraordinary."

It is said that every American wants to be somebody, but in fact, everyone in the world is like this, and the Chinese are no exception. A worker wants to be a "big shot," a store clerk wants to be a "manager," and a college graduate is proud to be able to go abroad for further study. To take a step back, even those great men who claim to be indifferent and retire to the mountains do not want to show that they are different from the "bustling" masses with their leisurely lives?

### Wandering Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Ten: Voluntary Sacrifice (77)

Just as Zhu Zhai was about to get out of bed, Little Wang's mother walked in and said, "Please sleep. It's not the boss who's back." Zhu Zhai asked, "Who is it?" Little Wang's mother said, "It's the milkman." Zhu listened, and lay down again. Little Wang's mother said, "It's getting light. I'm not here. Let her sleep well for a while." She smiled and walked out. Zhu Zhai had spent the night in a daze and had not rested. Now that it was dawn, Qi Wan had no news, and it was useless to worry. As soon as Little Wang's mother left, she covered her head with the quilt. At this time, her mind calmed down a little, and she fell asleep. When she woke up, it was already past nine o'clock. After a hasty snack, she rushed to the bank. At the bank for several hours, she called Little Wang's mother several times to ask if the boss had returned. The other side replied that she hadn't returned yet. Until she got off work in the afternoon, she rushed to Qi Wan's house and saw a cream-colored new car parked outside the door. The driver in the car was wearing a military uniform. She didn't know who had come. She hurried into the door and passed Little Wang's mother, who was holding a washbasin and was about to go upstairs. When she saw Zhu Qi coming in, she nodded and said, "The boss is back." Zhu Zhai was overjoyed and rushed upstairs. Little Wang's mother whispered to stop her, "Don't go up. There are guests upstairs!" Zhu Zhai was stunned and asked, "Who is it?" Little Wang's mother said, "I don't know. It's the boss and him who came together. Wait for him to leave before you go up." Zhu Zhai listened and involuntarily felt a sour feeling from the soles of her feet to the top of her head. Ignoring Little Wang's mother's obstruction, she rushed upstairs and looked out of the guest room. She saw Qi Wan and a military guest sitting on the sofa talking. (End of this chapter)

Chapter Eleven: Full of Doubts

It turned out that Qi Wan and Li Manying had returned from performing in Jinan and Qingdao. Manying introduced her to Chief Miao Zhongjie. After Zhongjie met Qi Wan, he was very enthusiastic and repeatedly wanted to come to Qi Wan's house for entertainment, but Qi Wan refused. Seeing Qi Wan's persistence, Manying sincerely persuaded her several times, saying that Chief Miao Zhongjie was newly arrived from the south and had considerable power in Beiping. She couldn't offend him, and he was very generous. If you could make him happy, you could make a big profit. Because Qi Wan was about to marry Zhu Zhai, she didn't want to associate with him anymore. Although Manying had persuaded her several times, she had never agreed. This day, because her nerves were quite agitated, she wanted to practice her promise to Yu Ru and break off the idea of Zhu Zhai. Only associating with Miao Zhongjie could anger Zhu Zhai and make him break away from the relationship on his own. Qi Wan was in a state of extreme agitation at the time and did not think carefully. After going out, she went straight to Manying to express her meaning. Manying was afraid of offending Zhongjie for this matter. When she heard that Qi Wan was willing to move the wine barrel to learn, she was very happy and quickly called to inform Zhongjie. Zhongjie then invited them to the Liuguo Hotel for dinner. Qi Wan knew that Zhongjie invited her to the Liuguo Hotel with bad intentions, but since she came with the idea of sacrifice, she was not afraid. After arriving at the Liuguo Hotel with Manying, Zhongjie had been paying attention to Qi Wan for a long time. Today, fortunately, he had the opportunity, so he was naturally unwilling to let go and tried his best to be attentive.

From our daily life, the principle of "hope to be extraordinary" dominates everywhere in the invisible. We love to smoke Sanjiu brand cigars or "mild and mellow" cigars worth a dime in U.S. dollars; we love to talk eloquently to show the depth of our knowledge and express our unique insights; we look down on Hollywood's mindless martial arts films and beast films, and even have a contemptuous attitude towards the audience who "only value low-level tastes." If economic ability permits, we naturally like to live in Western-style houses with "coal, electricity, sanitation, and telephone" all available, wearing expensive and well-tailored clothes, and travel by car; and our material desires are likely to be despised by scholars who advocate quietness and inaction. These scholars pride themselves on being "the only ones who are sober when everyone is drunk," "being extraordinary and escaping from the world," or "entering the mud and not being stained." In the final analysis, it may be another subconscious function of praying for "extraordinaryness" that is at work.

People often pursue "outstanding" but cannot get it. If they cannot go through the right path, they have to find another way. This is especially true in the United States, where the curiosity psychology is very strong. For example, an American writer hung a sign on his body that read "Selling U.S. dollars, each dollar sells for only 75 cents." Although it is a loss-making business, it can attract the attention of pedestrians. Another example is when a new film is released in Hollywood, the film company must find a way to have New York reporters interview the protagonist of the film in California from a long-distance call. The conversation is limited to trivial matters such as the weather, but even this long-distance telephone call is enough to cause a sensation.

I also know from some essay-style texts that describe New York life that New York women like to wear rubber "fake breasts." Considering their intention, they are not in seeking "extraordinary" beauty. Whenever I read the above-mentioned examples, I often have an indescribable feeling of humor and sadness mixed together in my heart.

### Remembering Mr. Chu Nanqiang

— Yu Jianhua

Yesterday I read Ling Xiaohan's "Wuyi Yixing" article, which mentioned Mr. Chu Nanqiang, believing that he deserves to be the strength of the South. I knew Mr. Nanqiang through the introduction of my predecessor, Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang. At that time, it was around the 20th year of the Republic of China, and Mr. Chu was trying his best to repair the Zhanggong and Shanquan Caves, and specially invited me to visit them in a letter. During my spring vacation, I accompanied my painting disciple Xu Peiji from Wuxi to Yixing, and enjoyed the two caves and other scenic spots. I was treated very kindly by Mr. Nanqiang. Although we communicated several times after we parted, we never had the chance to meet again. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, I heard that he led guerrillas to fight against the enemy. Whenever I met people from Yixing, I would inquire about him, but unfortunately I didn't know the details.

The two caves of Yixing are truly wonders in the southeastern provinces. Zhanggong Cave is divided into front and rear caves, majestic and great, spacious and accommodating. Stone stalactites hang from the top, like the face and crown of a Buddha, solemn and beautiful. Shanquan Cave is divided into upper and lower caves. The upper cave is warm in winter and cool in summer. In winter, warm air fills the cave, and visitors must take off their fur coats when they enter. In summer, the cold air is eerie, and visitors must add clothes when they enter. The colder it is outside the cave, the hotter it is inside the cave, and the hotter it is outside the cave, the colder it is inside the cave. The lower cave is winding and secluded, half land and half water. There are small boats that can pass through it. The stone walls are rugged and the stone stalactites are piled up, presenting various strange shapes.

Since the two caves are famous in the southeast, Mr. Nanqiang believes that to revitalize the commerce of Yixing and prosper the city of Yixing, there is nothing better than repairing the two caves as a slogan. When tourists gather, transportation, commerce, and hotels will be prosperous. Therefore, he spent ten years and exhausted his family fortune to inspect, open up, build, and construct. When his financial resources were insufficient, his daughter-in-law sold her dowry to supplement them. His enthusiasm and perseverance were truly moving, and the name of the two caves became famous as a result. The number of tourists did increase a lot because of this.

Mr. Nanqiang's morality and knowledge have long been admired by his peers. His repair of the two caves was entirely out of a sincere desire to benefit the town. The motive was good, and there was nothing to criticize. However, Mr. Nanqiang's personality was very strong, with a spirit of the foolish old man who moved mountains, but he lacked aesthetic sense. As a result, the natural beauty of the two caves was inevitably damaged, and all the buildings were inevitably ugly and could not match the natural scenery. Although he worked hard, it was half a waste. Many of those who traveled with him had this feeling. However, in view of Mr. Nanqiang's excitement, they did not dare to speak out. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, the situation of the two caves changed a lot. I don't know what they are like now.

Mr. Nanqiang was extremely healthy. Although he was in his sixties, he was still strong and vigorous, with a compelling heroic spirit. The leather shoes he wore had iron plates inlaid on the bottom, each weighing three pounds. Every day he wore these shoes and followed us up and down the mountain caves, walking as fast as flying. His home was inside the North Gate of Yixing. Four old-fashioned red lanterns hung in the living room. Whenever a good guest stopped by and was given preferential treatment, he would shout "Light the red lanterns" as a secret code. When the family heard this, they knew it was an important guest and prepared a sumptuous feast. Otherwise, they knew it was an ordinary guest and served the usual food. In his study, books, calligraphy, paintings, and antiques were arranged almost to the full. The wine utensils carved from bamboo roots that he collected were as many as dozens of kinds. There was an iron lion that was not even a foot long, which Mr. Nanqiang used as a pillow to sleep on for decades. Mr. Nanqiang's calligraphy was peculiar and unrestrained. He liked to write extremely small characters with an extremely large brush, so it was blurred and difficult to recognize. Those who got his letter (he liked to use postcards) often spent several days deciphering it.

I heard that Mr. Nanqiang had the elegant name of "Local Emperor" in Yixing. I don't know if it's true, but I can imagine his hard-working spirit. Recalling his voice and appearance, I can't help but feel regretful.

### Reasons for Divorce

— Wu Qi

A woman in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, filed for divorce from her husband and won the case. The reason for the divorce was that her husband served in the military during the war with the rank of major. After his discharge, he forced his wife to shout "Major" every time she saw him, and also had to salute.

A woman in Missouri filed for divorce because when she cooked a pot of onion ribs for dinner, her husband always divided the dish into two, eating the ribs himself and telling his wife to eat only the onions.

A woman in Pittsburgh filed for divorce because when she was sick, her husband called the funeral home to send someone to see her and also ordered plain wreaths in advance.

### The Socialization of Universities (Part 2)

— Wu Geng

In universities around the world today, there are many students, often insufficient classrooms, inadequate equipment, and a lack of teachers, resulting in a situation of too many monks and not enough porridge. Our country is no exception. I humbly suggest: instead of adopting a centralized system, why not switch to a decentralized one? Now that dance halls have already been banned, why not follow the principle of simplification and further utilize tea houses, bookstores, theaters, and the like as educational venues? For instance, Hu Shih could lecture on "Textual Research" at "Seventh Heaven," Feng Youlan could teach "Philosophy" at "Five-Story Building," Wu Jingxiong could lecture on his "Jurisprudence" at "MGM," and Yan Huiqing could recount his "Diplomatic Memoirs" at "Gao Le Bookstore." This way, on the one hand, it solves the problem of venues for scholars to lecture, and on the other hand, it raises the educational level of the general public. People spend their precious time listening to "Pingtan Masters" narrating "The Three Smiles Romance" because they lack better ways to arrange their time. If Yan Huiqing truly recounted his "Diplomatic Memoirs" at a bookstore, people would surely know what's good for them, naturally choosing the latter over the former.

As for the methods of lecturing, one could adopt the "Lecture Style": giving public lectures at a set time. One could also adopt the "Waiting-for-Instruction Style": sitting in a public venue, available for inquiries and discussions from those eager to learn. Or, one could adopt the "Blitz Style": scholars suddenly appearing at a certain dance hall, as the mood strikes them, to give an insightful academic lecture. As for the "tuition fees" as compensation, one could adopt the "Ticket System": specifying a certain ticket price, with attendees entering the venue with a ticket. One could also adopt the "Voluntary Contribution System": if the listener is satisfied, they can give the lecturer a certain amount of legal tender, the amount depending on the listener's financial ability or their level of satisfaction. Or, one could adopt the "Hybrid System": in addition to purchasing a ticket, if the listener feels that a certain scholar's knowledge is truly profound and deep, they may further contribute some funds to support their scholarly pursuits. Such education is truly "Democratic Education." Furthermore, with the state or private individuals establishing more complete libraries and science museums, university education would also be close to

If we manage education in this way, it would be the socialization of "education"; with such a strong academic atmosphere in society, it would be the "universitization" of society. Such university education provides opportunities for people of all walks of life in society, whether they are scholars, farmers, workers, merchants, military personnel, or others, is the first benefit; what people receive is not merely a formal four-year education, but lifelong and endless education at any time, is the second benefit; there are no age or class restrictions, benefiting the rich and poor alike, young and old, is the third benefit; unlike formal education with strict time constraints, people who are already employed can still pursue their careers while also having the opportunity to immerse themselves in an academic atmosphere, is the fourth benefit.

Under today's university education system, students spend four whole years of their precious time on so-called "studying," staking everything on a single bet, which is a great waste. Those who are willing to spend four years at university seriously overestimate the university, which is not as sacred as they imagine. Also, some people believe that they can learn everything they need in four years at university, which underestimates "education" too much; "education" is not that simple. Those who understand this will surely agree with my above-mentioned method of popularizing universities and will not criticize me for being humorous. I hope that righteous gentlemen and social elites will carefully consider my words.

United Effort by:

Shen Bao Newspaper and

Renhe Hospital, Baoli Hospital

Red Cross Hospital, Shangxian Women and Children's Hospital, Huisheng Obstetrics Hospital

Jointly Organize Assisted Childbirth

Mr. Jinhua Feng Generously Donates 280 Million Yuan

Hoping Impoverished Pregnant Women Apply Early, Enthusiastic Benefactors Donate Generously

In January, the "Assisted Childbirth for Impoverished Women" campaign helped a total of forty-two impoverished mothers, with twenty-four births at Renhe Hospital, costing over 20 million yuan; twelve at Shangxian Hospital, costing over 30 million yuan; five at Baoli Hospital, costing over 4 million yuan; and one at the Red Cross Hospital, costing over 2.6 million yuan. The total delivery costs for the four hospitals were 57.601 million yuan, and according to the contract, this newspaper should bear half of the delivery costs for the collaborating hospitals, which is 28.8305 million yuan. Compared to the childbirth assistance costs in December, January saw an increase of approximately 200 percent, which is indeed a difficult burden to bear for the "Assisted Childbirth for Impoverished Women" campaign, which relies entirely on reader donations.

However, Mr. Jinhua Feng, with the same generosity as in the past few months, helped us solve this immediate problem. In other words, he independently paid the entire cost, totaling 28.8305 million yuan. We hope that kind people in society will be as benevolent as Mr. Feng, so that the "Assisted Childbirth for Impoverished Women" campaign can expand day by day, benefiting both impoverished pregnant women and the care of infants immeasurably.
