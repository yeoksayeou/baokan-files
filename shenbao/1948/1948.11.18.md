### National Army on Pinghan Railway Advances North, Attacking Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, Completely Changing the Battle Situation South of the Yellow River; Annihilation Battle Underway Near Suxian

[Our Newspaper Bengbu Dispatch, 17th] According to reliable military sources: The main force on the Pinghan Railway is advancing north. The Huang Corps from Fuyang is crossing the Ying River and advancing north. The two routes will advance separately and strike together, attacking Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, cutting off the Longhai Railway, blocking the retreat of the bandit troops committing aggression in Xuzhou, and annihilating them in a decisive battle.

[Our Newspaper Xuzhou Dispatch, 17th] In this great victory of the Xuzhou campaign, the National Army routed Chen Yi. Chen Geng and Liu Bocheng's sixteen columns were defeated, with over 100,000 bandits killed or wounded. This is equivalent to dealing a devastating blow to the main bandit forces between the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers. The bandit army south of the Yellow River will have no strength to make trouble within half a year. This is not only enough to stabilize the Jianghuai region but is also the key to reversing the entire battle situation. Currently, the National Army's land and air forces are fiercely pursuing and annihilating the fleeing bandits, intercepting and encircling them. The battle situation south of the Yellow River is about to undergo a complete change. Nearly 20,000 bandits surrendered to the National Army on the 16th, and a large number of weapons were seized.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Military News Agency urgent telegram from the Xuzhou front at 6:00 PM on the 17th: The annihilation battle with Suxian as the center of gravity on the southern front is currently underway. The National Army on the southern route is advancing north along the Jinpu Railway. After recovering Guzhen, they are pursuing the victory. The vanguard has advanced to Qiaoche Station, heading towards Suxian. Furthermore, the rapid advance of the elite forces of the National Army moving south along the Jinpu Railway is also extremely rapid. The bandit army in the area near Suxian is being attacked from the north and south by our forces. Their morale is gradually collapsing, and they are already showing signs of fleeing.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Military News Agency urgent telegram from the Xuzhou front at 8:00 PM on the 17th: The National Army's Sun Corps launched a mopping-up operation on the 17th afternoon in the area within 20 li southeast of Xuzhou, completely annihilating the entire 20th Regiment of the 9th Division of Chen's Third Column, and then occupying the high ground at Xushan, Yangshantou, Wanjaying, and Tengjiazhai.

[Central News Agency Xuzhou Dispatch, 17th] Approximately two divisions of bandits advanced from both sides of the Jinpu Railway towards Weijiahe, Fengyuan, southwest of Pantang Town, which is more than 20 li southeast of Xuzhou, and Hou'erbao, as well as Xingzhuang and Shigang to its west. After a night of fierce fighting, the National Army's air force and artillery cooperated in a joint attack and annihilated all of them by this morning. It is estimated that the troops annihilated near Pantang Town were one division of Chen's Eighth Column, and the troops annihilated in the Hou'erbao area were two regiments of the 9th Division of Chen's Third Column (the other regiment was also annihilated there two days ago). In addition, a certain unit of the National Army launched a surprise attack on the bandits in Fengxian on the 16th under the moonlight, killing more than 4,000 bandits, capturing more than 1,000, and seizing hundreds of long and short guns and eight mortars.

Powerful forces advancing from Guzhen have passed Renqiao and may reach Longwangmiao tonight, taking Suxian directly with the main forces on the left and right wings. The bandits are showing signs of wavering. (Another telegram) Most of the traffic police have retreated from the front lines to Bengbu, with wounded soldiers among them. The railway protection unit has taken them in, and the community is launching a campaign to comfort the troops.

[Our Newspaper Xuzhou Dispatch, 17th] After being defeated by the National Army on the eastern front, the remnants of the 1st, 3rd, and 10th Columns of the bandits crossed the Bulao River and fled north yesterday. Because the National Army tracked and pursued them, the remnants of the bandits turned around and fled west towards Yaolou, Yian Mountain, and Mao Yinzhai (all located 12 kilometers southwest of Xuzhou). The National Army shelled the bandits overnight last night. This morning, the National Army's mechanized units continued to pursue the remnants. Large formations of the air force continued to extensively bomb the Bulao River and the crossings along the Grand Canal, cutting off the bandits' escape route north.

[Central News Agency Xuzhou Dispatch, 17th] A certain unit of the Li Corps successively captured Chenjialou, Zhengji, Taipingzhuang, and other strongholds northwest of Daxujia on the eastern flank today. After being surrounded, a bandit regiment in Taipingzhuang repeatedly attempted to escape but was ultimately annihilated with the coordination of tanks. In Zhengji, 11 light and heavy machine guns and 3 rocket launchers were seized. The loot in Taipingzhuang and Chenjialou was more than ten times that amount.

[Another telegram] The Suppression Headquarters announced: The bandits on the eastern flank of Xuzhou are under the control of our Qiu, Huang, and Li Corps and have no way to escape the battle. In order to avoid being completely annihilated by us, the bandits have no choice but to continue to fight like cornered beasts. The bandits fleeing south of Xuzhou, fearing being cut off along the way by our forces, are also making a last-ditch effort to counterattack us, attempting to contain the pressure on our eastern flank in order to cover their escape. In addition to our southern front forces dealing a head-on blow to the counterattacking bandits and scoring many victories, our eastern flank main forces are continuing to fiercely attack the bandits in their face, striving to annihilate the main force of the bandits in order to achieve a permanent solution.

### Xuzhou City is Extremely Quiet; Foreign Reporters Report No War Fires Within Twenty Miles

[Gao Erya, Director of the United Press China Branch, Xuzhou Dispatch, 17th] This important military town in northern Jiangsu was extremely quiet on the 17th, as if it were hundreds of miles away from the battlefield, and unlike a city whose fate is attracting worldwide attention and is enough to determine the overall situation of the war. There is no war fire within twenty miles around Xuzhou. The reporter came to Xuzhou by civil aviation plane on the 17th. No fierce fighting between the two armies was seen along the way, nor was there any troop movement. The residents of Xuzhou City are as quiet as ever and not panicked at all. The north and south airports are no different from Shanghai's Longhua Airport. However, the cruel reality is that from a point 25 miles east of Xuzhou (near Nianzhuang) to a battle line 50 miles east of Xuzhou at Xin'anzhen, and within 20 miles of Xuzhou City, there are only small-scale sporadic artillery battles.

The plane flew back and forth between Bengbu and Xuzhou, but saw overturned rails, crisscrossed sleepers, and locomotives lying everywhere. Chinese Flying General Tang Jun told the reporter: "The situation around Xuzhou has become calm in the past two days, and the situation has improved. As far as the current situation is concerned, this place is not threatened."

### America's Policy Toward China Remains Largely Unchanged; Presidents of Both Nations Exchange Views; Remaining Military Aid Funds Will Be Disbursed as Quickly as Possible

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] Truman, while entertaining reporters in Key West, Florida, on the 16th, briefly discussed the situation in our country. Truman stated that the United States' policy toward China remains largely unchanged. When asked if he planned to take any new actions against the Communist threat, Truman replied that he and President Chiang were currently exchanging views through correspondence. Truman did not disclose the subjects discussed in his correspondence with President Chiang. When asked if he planned to provide any emergency aid to China, he simply replied that he was executing an act of Congress. Truman explained that of the $125 million in military aid to China approved by Congress, $112 million had already been disbursed, and the remaining amount would be paid out as soon as possible.

[US Information Service, Key West, Florida, 16th] At today's press conference, President Truman was asked what kind of emergency aid the United States could provide to China. President Truman stated that he was executing the orders of the 80th Congress, which had approved $125 million for China. This money could be used for military purposes. He said that of this amount, the Chinese government had already spent $112 million, and that the most effective use of the remainder was being studied. He also stated that no new emergency aid could be given before the 81st Congress convened in January. He firmly stated that no special session of the 80th Congress would be called. President Truman stated that the US government is maintaining contact with President Chiang.

[United Press, Washington, 16th] It was widely rumored on the evening of the 16th that Chinese Ambassador Wellington Koo, when meeting with Acting Secretary of State Robert Lovett, had requested him to forward a personal letter from President Chiang to President Truman, appealing for emergency aid to China. When asked if this was true, Wellington Koo replied, "No comment."

[Associated Press, Washington, 16th] President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall have agreed to review the global situation here on the 22nd, during which the situation in China and possible responses will be a major topic. Any action the Truman administration takes, beyond issuing a statement of support for China and accelerating aid plans, will likely be presented to Congress in the form of recommendations.

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] Diplomatic authorities here speculate that President Truman and the State Department are considering President Chiang's call for a reaffirmation of the US policy of aiding the Chinese government to boost morale and public spirit. Undersecretary of State Robert Lovett will hold a press conference at 5:00 PM (standard time) on the afternoon of the 17th, but it is not certain beforehand whether a statement on the situation in China will be made at that time. Sources with inside information say that the unveiling of major US policies is more likely after the President meets with Secretary of State Marshall at the White House on the 22nd. China is currently requesting the US government to provide an additional $1 billion in aid, $600 million of which is for military and $400 million for economic purposes. China apparently hopes the US will accept the same commitment as to Greece by actively participating in the anti-Communist war, which Washington authorities are still hesitant about.

Editorial

### How to Implement the Import-Export Linkage System

According to Article 10 of the revised Gold Yuan Note Issuance Regulations, anyone holding Gold Yuan or Gold Yuan Notes may purchase foreign exchange in accordance with government regulations on foreign exchange management. The regulations on foreign exchange management, in the portion concerning import-export trade, should be formulated in accordance with the linkage system. According to this regulation, the import-export linkage problem, which has been debated for over two years, has finally reached a decisive resolution. What remains to be supplemented is how this system should be formulated, namely, the technical problem regarding implementation.

First, how to link: Should a combined linkage or an individual linkage be adopted? The so-called individual linkage means a rigid regulation that a certain export commodity must be exchanged for a certain import commodity. For example, in February of this year, the Full Economic Commission planned to exchange cotton cloth and silk fabrics for cotton, rice, hemp, and hemp products from Southeast Asia and India, and to exchange tung oil, hog bristles, and mineral ores for transportation equipment from the United States. We believe that this formalized method is absolutely unsuitable. Because the needs and competitive conditions of foreign markets vary greatly, and the power does not entirely rest with us. Furthermore, the production and sales of goods available for export in our country, whether raw materials or finished products, are not always constant and must be adjusted at any time to suit the situation. For example, the fluctuating sales of cotton cloth in recent years are a clear proof of this. Therefore, for the sake of flexible operation, it is better to adopt a general approach rather than tying one's hands and adding more restrictions.

Second, the scope should be limited to the Yangtze River Road. Should the linkage be comprehensive or partial? Currently, import-export trade is still under strict management. It seems that goods permitted for import and export should not be restricted to linkage. As for certain goods that are not allowed to be imported or exported, or should be restricted from import or export, it is not difficult to clearly stipulate in the above-mentioned management regulations, and it is also unrelated to the scope of linkage. The main points that should be limited are (1) the amount of imports and exports must be offset, and exports should not exceed imports to prevent the outflow of gold and (2) within a certain period, the total amount of imports of various goods may be adjusted to avoid uneven damage.

Third, should the foreign exchange obtained from exports be allowed to be transferred? Those who advocate not allowing transfer are concerned about avoiding the emergence of black markets and avoiding stimulating prices, and their intentions are certainly understandable. However, they may not know that there are too many reasons for price fluctuations, not limited to the black market foreign exchange. Furthermore, black market foreign exchange has never been completely eradicated before the restoration of the free foreign exchange market. There is no need to reject food because of choking and uniformly prohibit its transfer. Moreover, import and export businesses each have their own specialties, and it is impossible to force them to operate concurrently. Even for those who originally operate concurrently, the goods they import are not necessarily what they themselves need. Therefore, the foreign exchange obtained by exporters, in addition to their own concurrent import business, should be allowed to be freely transferred without any restrictions. Moreover, the foreign exchange received, in addition to the requirement to import at least the equivalent amount of permitted goods within a specified period, should not be subject to other conditions. Because the sole purpose of the linkage system is to exchange goods internationally to alleviate the shortage of foreign exchange. As long as an equal amount of imported goods is used to replenish exported goods, the goal is achieved, and it does not originally require that the importer must be the original exporter. In other words, the goal of compensation is in goods, not in people. If human intervention is mixed in, many troubles and malpractices will be added out of thin air, and the result will greatly weaken the function of linkage.

Fourth, should there be a specified time limit for linkage? This is a very important issue and also a rather difficult one, because if the import deadline is not specified in advance, exporters may take the opportunity to use materials as an attempt to evade capital. On the other hand, if the deadline is set too short or too strict, it may also shackle exports and cause many inconveniences. This is very clear: overseas market prices, locks, competition, or other temporary changes are not easily predicted by exporters. There are many examples of this, and the durability and seasonality of various goods also vary. In addition, due to the shortage of materials after the war and frequent labor strikes, various orders are often delayed for a long time and cannot be delivered within a short period of time. Therefore, when implementing linkage, how to stipulate a reasonable deadline so that this linkage procedure can be fully completed is indeed not an easy task. Some people advocate handling exports first and then imports; others advocate completing the import application procedures at the same time as exporting. This is just a kind of prevention against the evasion of export foreign exchange and prohibited imports.

Fifth, how to take into account the government's need for foreign exchange? It is feared that the foreign exchange from exports will be completely taken by importers, and the government will not be able to cope with its huge expenditures. In fact, private individuals can operate export businesses, and public institutions can also operate them concurrently. In the past, the Central Trust Bureau and other institutions handled barter trade and export sales, and the quantity was not small. However, whether the goods exported by the government and the foreign exchange it obtains should be subject to the linkage system is, of course, another question. Moreover, the remittance portion of overseas Chinese, the transfer portion of foreign currency, and possible loans are not within the scope of import and export linkage. However, with the implementation of linkage, imports and exports offset each other, and the government no longer needs to bear this huge import expenditure. Therefore, it seems that there is not much problem with the government's required foreign exchange position. Some people believe that (1) the foreign exchange obtained by exporters, in addition to handling imports themselves, should still be settled with the Central Bank if there is a surplus; (2) the government may as well extract one or two tenths from each export foreign exchange for public use. This also seems to be superfluous.

We have always consistently advocated this linkage system, believing that it is an effective way to promote export and increase import. However, we only regard it as one of the effective methods, and other methods should still be promoted separately from various aspects to expand international trade. Because the decline of the countryside, the obstruction of transportation, and the various goods available for export have already declined year by year to a very fragmented point. As a result of soaring prices, it often forms an inverted situation with overseas market prices. In addition, the original foreign markets have been repeatedly seized, and it is not easy to recover and pass on. Therefore, if we have excessive expectations after implementing import and export linkage, thinking that this method alone can immediately and completely restore the export business, I am afraid that we are viewing the problem too simply. The details of how to implement the linkage system are currently being drafted. We hope that these detailed rules must take into account the facts and avoid creating complications to avoid losing the original intention. At the same time, the competent authorities should still take a positive attitude and earnestly promote various methods related to promoting exports to supplement the deficiencies of the linkage system.

### Fujian Profiteers Suffer the Consequences; Raising Prices Causes Credit Tightness; Poor Turnover Causes Multiple Bankruptcies

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 17th] Under the phenomenon of high prices and tight credit, several important commercial firms have recently gone bankrupt in the wholesale distribution centers of Shanghang Road and Xiahang Road in Fuzhou. Each firm has debts of more than 300,000 Gold Yuan, all due to poor cash flow. The bankruptcy of these commercial firms shocked the entire market, causing general speculators to lose color. Since the start of the resource buying spree, they have absorbed large quantities of goods at any interest rate to engage in hoarding and seek huge profits, eventually destroying the government's price limit line and making the lives of most people even more difficult. As a result of their raising prices, credit has become tight, causing those with weaker turnover capacity to have to declare bankruptcy. On the other hand, floating capital continues to concentrate in Shanghai, and the Shanghai exchange premium is even higher than before the August 19 currency reform. This extraordinary economic situation is rare in the past.

### The Three Powers Refuse to Negotiate with the Soviet Union Before the Berlin Blockade is Completely Lifted; Formally Reply to the Appeal of Evatt and Lie; The Berlin Dispute is Still Handled by the Security Council

[Our Newspaper] Paris, 17th Radio: Evatt Lie issued a joint statement, again urging the four powers to quickly resolve the Berlin crisis. This statement was issued hours after the Western powers rejected the proposal to resume four-power talks.

[United Press, Paris, 17th Dispatch] The United States, Britain, and France today formally replied to the peace appeal of UN General Assembly President Evatt and Secretary-General Lie, accusing the Soviet Union of hindering the resolution of the four-power dispute and advocating that the Berlin issue continue to be handled by the Security Council. The US reply reiterated that it is unwilling to negotiate the Berlin issue under the threat of a Soviet blockade. Once the blockade is lifted, it will be prepared to negotiate with it. The British reply stated that the Soviet Union's rejection of the mediation proposal of the six neutral countries has hindered the resolution of the Berlin issue. The US reply was signed by Secretary of State Marshall, stating that the United States had directly negotiated this matter with the Soviet Union until it became clear that the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin was intended to achieve political goals, and the Soviet Union had no right to these goals. We therefore submitted this issue as a case of endangering peace to the Security Council for discussion, and it is still on the agenda of the meeting. The Berlin dispute involves the basic principles of the United Nations Charter, that is, whether the Soviet government may use force, whether it is a blockade or economic pressure, to deprive Western countries of their right to participate in the administration of Berlin. Evatt and Lie did not express their opinions when they received the replies from the three countries. According to well-informed sources, the two will continue to mediate despite being rebuffed. The US reply also stated that in addition to preparing to participate in the Security Council to resolve the Berlin issue, the United States also intends to participate in any efforts to address the fundamental disputes involved in this issue, so that the threat to peace can be lifted and all parties concerned can sincerely accept it.

### President Truman States That the US Stance on the Berlin Issue Remains Unchanged and Is Willing to Meet Stalin in Washington

[US Information Service, Key West, Florida, 16th Dispatch] President Truman told reporters today that the US stance on the Berlin issue has not changed. The United States will not negotiate with the Soviet Union on the Berlin or the entire German issue until the Soviet Union lifts the land blockade of Berlin. Truman said that he will review the overall international situation on November 22 (the day after returning to Washington) and will meet with Secretary of State Marshall and Economic Cooperation Administration European Inspector Harriman. Harriman returned to Washington today and will conduct consultations with all parties for two weeks. The President said that he has learned of the proposal of Evatt Lie. Marshall has drafted a reply, which has been approved by himself.

When reporters asked about the rumor that Marshall was about to resign, the President said that he would discuss this matter when he met with Marshall. Marshall had intended to retire after resigning as Chief of Staff. His appointment as Secretary of State was driven by patriotism. Answering other questions, Truman said that he had no plans to send a special envoy to the Soviet Union, and his wife did not intend to go to the Soviet Union to meet with Stalin, but he was eager to meet with the Soviet leader in Washington at any time. At the same time, Soviet Representative Vyshinsky has submitted a reply to the proposal of Evatt Lie, reiterating the position of the Soviet Union in its note to the West on October 3. Vyshinsky said that the Soviet Union agreed with Evatt Lie's view that "the resolution of the Berlin issue will affect the resolution of other issues, such as the treaties on Germany, Austria, and Japan." The Soviet government "also believes that personal contact and mutual trust among the leaders of various countries are essential to improving international relations." Observers pointed out that Evatt Lie's proposal did not mention a meeting of the leaders of various countries. Vyshinsky raised the issue of the entire Germany, while Evatt Lie's proposal did not touch on the entire Germany, but only advocated resolving the Berlin issue.

### Soviet Union Agrees to Resume Negotiations, Still Considers the Four-Power Directive on Berlin to be Valid

[TASS News Agency, Moscow, 17th Dispatch] Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation to the UN General Assembly, sent the following reply to UN General Assembly President Evatt and UN Secretary-General Lie on the 16th, according to instructions from the Soviet government:

"The Soviet government has received your letter of November 13. The Soviet government expresses its deep gratitude for your efforts to mediate the existing differences. As early as October 3 this year, the Soviet government sent a note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, in which the Soviet government suggested that the directive issued to the Berlin commanders on August 30, which was agreed upon through negotiations, should be recognized as an agreement reached between the four governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France to resolve the Berlin issue. At the same time, the Soviet government suggested convening a meeting of foreign ministers to review the Berlin issue and the issue of the entire Germany in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The Soviet government still adheres to this same position. The Soviet government shares your opinion that the resolution of the Berlin issue will have a positive impact on the resolution of other issues, such as the treaties on Germany, Austria, and Japan. Regarding the great significance of direct contact and mutual trust between the leaders of strong countries for the enhancement of diplomatic relations, the Soviet government also shares your opinion."

### Marshall to Return to the US Tomorrow or the Day After to Meet with the President to Review the Overall Situation; Rumors of Major Changes in Cabinet Personnel

[United Press, Paris, 17th Dispatch] US Secretary of State Marshall and US Permanent Representative to the Security Council Austin will return to the US by plane on the 19th or 20th.

According to the US delegation, Marshall does not intend to return to Paris.

[United Press, Washington, 16th Dispatch] Harriman said that he had no comments on the rumor that if Marshall resigned, he might become Secretary of State.

[United Press, Key West, Florida, 17th Dispatch] Well-informed sources said that President Truman has generally made a decision on the retention of cabinet members, but does not intend to announce it until suitable candidates are found. Truman said at a press conference that since the election, everyone except himself has been overstepping their authority and reorganizing the cabinet on his behalf. He said that he has a plan when the time is right. Many people interpreted this statement to mean that the president's so-called opportune time refers to January 20 of next year, when his second term begins. Changes in personnel inside and outside the cabinet remain a mystery. It is expected that Secretary of Defense Forrestal and Undersecretary of State Lovett will both resign. Marshall will return to the US soon to report to the President on the UN General Assembly and the European situation. His departure will be decided at that time.

[United Press, Paris, 17th Dispatch] Nine days after General de Gaulle's French People's Alliance won a victory in the Senate elections, de Gaulle received reporters at the Alliance headquarters on the 17th and suggested organizing a new global strategic system in which France would be responsible for Europe and North Africa, the United States would be responsible for the Far East and the Pacific, and Britain would be in charge of the Middle East and East Africa. De Gaulle also called for elections to the National Assembly, saying that France would collapse completely politically and economically if it did not overthrow its centrist coalition government.

The National Assembly is the lower house of France and has great legislative power. So far, the French People's Alliance has not gained a seat. De Gaulle hinted that he might dissolve or ban the Communist Party once he takes office. He advocated abolishing the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and replacing them with a global strategic bureau composed of the US President, the British Prime Minister, the French Head of Government, and senior military advisors from the three countries.

### Minister of Interior Accuses the Soviet Union of Inciting Labor Unrest in France

The Cominform is Indeed Providing Substantial Aid to the French Communist Party

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 16th] French Interior Minister Moch on the 10th formally accused the Soviet Union and its satellite states of inciting and financially supporting the labor unrest in France, deliberately undermining the Marshall Plan. Moch told the Parliament that he had documents proving that the Communist Information Bureau (Cominform) had guaranteed the French Communist Party substantial aid to prevent the strikes from ending prematurely. After the Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), controlled by the French Communist Party, appealed to Zhdanov, the chief Soviet representative of the Cominform, the aforementioned guarantee was obtained. Zhdanov had passed away two months prior. Moch continued, stating that émigrés from many Eastern European countries had been secretly funneling large sums of money to France to assist the strikes, and the Cominform had agreed to provide 459,000 francs for inciting the strikes.

### Over 50,000 Japanese Miners Implement Regional Strikes

Coal Production Losses are Incalculable

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 17th] Fifty-eight thousand coal miners today held their eighth day of rotating strikes. The first round of rotating strikes is scheduled to end today, and the second round of rotating strikes will begin on November 23 if labor and management fail to reach an agreement. Japanese coal production will suffer losses due to this strike, but the exact figures for these losses, except for the Yamaguchi district in southern Kyushu, are currently impossible to calculate. In the Yamaguchi district, the total amount of coal lost due to the coal miners' strike has reached over 6,000 tons.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] The All-Japan Coal Mine Workers' Union, the Japan Coal Miners' Union, and the Japan Coal Mining Association, three labor unions, held a joint struggle committee on the 16th to discuss concrete measures for the second phase of the strike. It was decided that from the 23rd to the 25th, the strikes would be implemented in three regions, each reducing coal production by 33%.

### Execution by Hanging for Seven War Criminals, Including Tojo, to be Advanced; MacArthur to Make Final Decision Next Monday

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 17th] Well-informed sources stated on the 17th that MacArthur and Allied officers will meet on the 22nd to discuss the sentences of Japanese war criminals. Tojo and the other six Japanese war criminals sentenced to hanging will be executed within the next five or six days. However, no official announcement has been made to date. Allied officers and Eighth Army officers are tight-lipped about the execution of the hangings and how the bodies will be handled. It is generally believed that the execution of the Japanese war criminals is imminent, and there is evidence to support this view.

MacArthur only allowed the defendants' lawyers eight days, from November 12th to 19th, to file appeals. Well-informed sources stated that the reason for the swift execution of the hangings is to prevent the defendants' lawyers from turning the entire event into a legal dispute and delaying it. The defendants' lawyers are attempting to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the United Nations, and other institutions. Officials, prosecutors, and the general public here at the Far East International Military Tribunal believe that the appeal is unlikely to succeed, and the final decision rests with MacArthur. Based on past experience here, it is generally believed that the hangings will be carried out by Eighth Army officers in Sugamo Prison. Whether reporters will be allowed to visit the execution site is still uncertain. Observers say that unless reporters are allowed to attend, rumors that Japanese war criminals have not been hanged will likely arise frequently. Such rumors emerged after Japanese war criminals in the Philippines were secretly executed.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 17th] Former Japanese Prime Minister Hirota Koki, one of the Japanese war criminals sentenced to hanging by the Far East International Military Tribunal, has reportedly had his son hire a lawyer to prevent anyone from petitioning MacArthur for commutation of his sentence.

### China Believes the Japanese War Criminals' Verdict is Extremely Fair

Shang Zhen, the head of the Chinese delegation, has received an invitation from MacArthur to attend the meeting of the Allied Committee on Japan and the heads of the Allied delegations to Japan on the 22nd to express his opinions on the verdict. According to the original verdict, Tojo, Doihara, Itagaki, Matsui, and four others were sentenced to death, sixteen were sentenced to life imprisonment, and two were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment. In the review of the verdict, MacArthur only has the power to reduce sentences and not to increase them. The Chinese side believes that the verdict is very fair and there is no need for revision.

Including this month, the number of Japanese prisoners of war to be repatriated by the Soviet Union is estimated to be 37,000, which is 13,000 fewer than the total number agreed upon by Allied Headquarters and the Soviet Union each month. The two sides agreed to repatriate 50,000 Japanese prisoners of war each month.

### Comet Seen in Tokyo; Extremely Beautiful

The light from its tail is especially beautiful. The observatory will begin to invite people from all walks of life to observe it starting next week. This is a new phenomenon in the astronomical world that has reappeared on Earth after thirty-eight years.

### Yoshida Urges the Diet to Pass the Japanese Civil Service Law

Indirect Criticism of Soviet Opposition

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] When the Japanese Parliament discussed the revision of the Civil Service Law this afternoon, Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida implicitly criticized the Soviet Union. He stated that the Allied Headquarters' letter of July 22, which stated that government civil servants should not collectively bargain or strike, has the ultimate decision-making power for the Japanese government. He also stated that the government is not considering the opinions expressed against the letter by the Far Eastern Commission, which clearly refers to the Soviet Union's firm opposition to the Allied Headquarters' measures. Yoshida also urged the Parliament to quickly pass the revision of the Civil Service Law with tactics to accelerate the dissolution of the Japanese Parliament, which is considered by all to be an acceleration tactic. He also emphasized that for the Japanese government, the Allied Headquarters' letter should be considered first.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] The Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, Katayama, visited MacArthur at noon on the 17th to discuss the amendment to the Civil Service Law in the Diet. The meeting lasted about one hour.

### Two Ships Carrying Rice from Hong Kong and Taiwan Arrive in Shanghai; October Rice Ration to be Distributed by the 25th; Authorities are Negotiating for the Release of Rice Seized in Various Regions

[Our Dispatch] The government has temporarily borrowed 9,800 tons of rice from Hong Kong, with Jardine Matheson & Co. handling the loading of 5,000 tons and Taikoo & Co. handling 4,800 tons. The first ship, Jardine Matheson's "Zexheng" (澤生) , carrying 1,700 tons, arrived in port yesterday afternoon and berthed at the Gonghexiang (公和祥) Wharf for unloading.

[Our Dispatch] The city's Food Conference was held at the City Hall Conference Room yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, presided over by Mayor Wu, with the attendance of more than ten representatives from relevant agencies. It is reported that Jardine Matheson's "Zexheng" (澤生) has already arrived in Shanghai, carrying 1,600 tons of rice from Hong Kong. In addition, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Zhongxing" (中興) has also arrived in Shanghai, carrying 500 tons of rice from Taiwan. Goods can be picked up starting today. Technical issues related to unloading were discussed during the meeting. It was also learned that the city's October rice ration will be completely distributed by the 25th of this month. The November rice ration is scheduled to begin distribution on December 5th.

The city's food supply has gradually improved due to a slight improvement in the situation of transportation obstructions in various regions in recent days, and the most severe period has passed. Most of the October rice ration has already arrived, and the remaining approximately 30,000 dan (石) are expected to arrive before the 20th. The Food Emergency Procurement and Storage Committee will soon begin planning for the November rice ration. It is reported that the city's rice ration has been seized by local authorities in various regions. Among them, the larger amounts include 10,000 dan (石) in Zhejiang Province. The original agreement was to exchange the rice for fertilizer, and the fertilizer had already been delivered to and received by the Zhejiang Provincial Government. However, the Zhejiang Provincial Government insisted on "deducting" 5,000 dan (石) to have the "819" price limit repurchased by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, resulting in a stalemate. In addition, of the 50,000 dan (石) supplied to Shanghai by Jiangxi Province, only over 6,000 dan (石) have been approved for transportation to date. The relevant authorities are continuing to negotiate for the release of the above-mentioned seized rice.

[Our Dispatch] According to news from the City Government News Office, Wuxi deducts two dou (斗) per shi (石) of rice purchased by Shanghai merchants, and the Lujiaxiang (陸家浜) Security Team under Kunshan County detained more than 40 rice boats passing through the area. After learning of the above-mentioned situation, Mayor Wu immediately telegraphed Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Ding Chizhi (丁治醫) yesterday morning, requesting immediate rectification.

### December Rice Ration for Public School Teachers to Still Be Distributed by Rice Shops

### Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Explains High and Low Labor-Capital Dispute Indices in Detail, Hoping for Cooperation to Eliminate Disputes

[Our Dispatch] The City Government has announced that the employee living index for the first half of this month is 8.1 times. Many employers believe that the multiple is too high and they cannot afford it, but some employees still believe it is too low and express doubts about the method of compiling this living index. Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau made a special statement yesterday, saying that the index was based on on-site investigations and was jointly reviewed and approved before publication. Although the representatives of the General Labor Union repeatedly questioned it at the time, they expressed understanding after the attendees explained it. However, since the opening of price limits on the 1st of this month, the market fluctuations have been more extraordinary than usual, and because the supply of some goods during this period was insufficient, the owners arbitrarily bargained for prices without standards, which inevitably gave people a deep impression. In fact, however, it is often a matter of having a price but no market, and not all of them are actual transactions. These virtual bids cannot be used as the basis for statistics. As for the dates of the price surveys for various items in the living index, they are routinely Tuesdays and Fridays. The City Government Statistics Office sends personnel to conduct on-site surveys. Among them, vegetables, rice, and noodles are actually purchased to use the purchase price as the price for the day, which is indeed reliable and well-founded, and different from the virtual bids that arbitrarily bargained for prices. Director Wu also said that although the investigation and compilation of this index are conducted by the City Government Statistics Office, he also sent personnel to participate in the investigation in order to be thorough in preparation for this highly abnormal situation on the market. The staff members have badges for easy identification, and it is also a fact that the owners may be more cautious and dare not raise prices excessively when bargaining. Director Wu said that in the past, during the extremely severe rice shortage, rice prices had jumped wildly, and citizens felt a great threat, but factories often borrowed and issued rice to employees or allocated in-kind items to help regulate them. In addition, workers largely pre-paid one month's wages in November and were allowed to temporarily not deduct them, which helped workers' lives to some extent. During this period of price adjustment, the results of the index compilation will inevitably differ from person to person and it is difficult to fully meet the ideals of all parties. Director Wu sincerely hopes that labor and management will continue to earnestly refer to the spirit of cooperation in the past to eliminate disputes.

### Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Explains Various Salary Issues

[Our Dispatch] Since the wage system in various industries in the city has been restored to the living index-based salary calculation method, some factories have calculated wages according to the previous period or the previous month's index, and there is no index for October. There are some misunderstandings between labor and management about how to calculate, whether to use the gold yuan obtained on August 19 as the base, whether the discounts stipulated by the government in the past should continue to be implemented, and the date of wage payment. Wu Kaixian, Chairman of the Labor-Capital Assessment Committee of the city, specially issued the following explanation yesterday: (1) The base salary of wages in various industries should be based on the gold yuan obtained after the currency reform and calculated according to the employee living index announced by the City Government (that is, one gold yuan in the past salary is 8.1 gold yuan in the previous period of wages in November). (2) If the wages have been calculated according to the previous period's index in the past, the wages for the first half of November will be settled according to the current period's index because there is no index for the previous period. In the future, it will be handled according to the original habit. (3) The base salary will no longer be discounted if the wages have been converted into gold yuan according to the government's regulations. As for the employers, if the business or production is not good and the wages cannot be borne, those who have agreed with the labor and management to formulate a separate discount method will still follow their agreement. (4) The date of wage payment is still handled in accordance with the regulations of the Wage Payment Guidelines for Factories in Various Industries decided by the Labor-Capital Assessment Committee (that is, each factory will set its own fixed payment period within seven days after the index is announced).

### Seamen and Sailors Demand a Double Increase in Salaries

[Our Dispatch] The China Merchant Marine Officers' Association and other five seafarer and sailor organizations submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday for the announcement of the compilation method and calculation base of this living index because the index was too low and the salaries obtained could not maintain life. They also said that if this period's index cannot be changed, please notify the shipping companies to increase the salaries by one time according to the 8.1 times index to maintain life. It is reported that the freight has increased by 15 times compared to before.

### Chinese Employees of Taikoo Shipping Company Went on Strike Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] The Chinese employees of the British Taikoo Shipping Company went on strike due to the stalemate between labor and management over the price of four dou (斗) of rice rations.

### Bribery Case of Fuel Management Committee Officials; Fifth Trial Concludes with Closing Arguments; Manager of Suzhou Electric Company Testifies, Describing Invitations to Banquets and Delivery of Funds

[Report from Our Newspaper] The District Court judges Shen Tianbao (Presiding Judge), Xie Zhiying, and Shao Renjie continued the trial of the Fuel Management Committee officials accused of bribery yesterday. The defendants Yang Yunfu, Zou Jidao, Zhao Bojun, Mao Meixuan, Sun Jice, Lin Kezhen, Miao Shouzi, Dai Weihua, Xu Baoguang, Ren Hui, Han Chengpu, and Sun Zhigang were brought to court, along with Sun Zhigang, and the trial concluded with closing arguments from morning until evening. The verdict is scheduled to be announced at 9:00 AM on the 24th of this month.

Yesterday was the fifth trial session of this case. At the request of the defendants, including Sun Jice, the manager of the Suzhou Electric Company, Zhang Bintong, was summoned to testify. According to Zhang's testimony, the company needed 3,000 to 3,500 tons of coal per month. In order to facilitate the allocation of coal, they hosted Director Sun and others at the Xinghualou and International Hotel in the city twice at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. This spring, Sun Jice's family traveled to Suzhou, where they were hosted at a banquet and given various local products before their departure.

Equivalent to the Price of 100 Dan of Rice

Zhang further stated that at the end of 1947, Director Sun sent someone to Suzhou to borrow 100 dan of rice. At that time, Zhang declined due to the company's financial difficulties and the approaching New Year. However, in January and February of this year, the Fuel Management Committee reduced the coal allocation, citing the unavailability of the Beining Road and requiring the company to go to Beijing to collect coal. Because the company urgently needed coal, they reluctantly sent Director Sun a New China Bank cashier's check for 100 million yuan (equivalent to the price of 100 dan of rice at the time) during the Lunar New Year. In March, the coal allocation was restored to the original amount. On September 22 of this year, Director Sun claimed that a friend needed 1,000 gold yuan, and the company immediately sent someone to deliver the money. When questioned about this, Sun repeatedly claimed that it was exchanged for a watch, but Zhang denied this in court. Sun then stammered, saying, "The money was sent by Manager Zhang voluntarily." Lin Keying was then questioned about Zhang Shitong's offering banquets and sending money. Lin denied receiving money but admitted to being invited to the International Hotel and receiving local products. After examining the other defendants, the closing arguments began.

Providing Reporting Opinions

Le Zhuangxin, Section Chief of the Municipal Government's Investigation Division, first provided several reporting opinions from the perspective of handling the case: (1) This case is a官商勾結 [collusion between officials and merchants] bribery case. The main task of the Fuel Management Committee is to control fuel and regulate supply and demand. The law is well-intentioned, but those who implement it take the opportunity to enrich themselves, which greatly affects legitimate coal merchants and creates black market coal. (2) The defendants Dai Weihua, Xu Baoguang, Ren Hui, etc., worked diligently in the committee and did not handle external affairs. Although they received bribes, they did not know what they were receiving, so their criminal behavior is relatively minor. (3) In Mao Meixuan's case, he handled the procurement certificates for 500 tons of coal, which included a 2% commission. Mao did not know this, so if Mao is at fault, it is for handling the procurement certificates. (4) Sun Zhigang, as the general affairs officer of the Jiangzhe Shipping Company, was only acting on orders to deliver the bribe.

The Evidence of Bribery is Conclusive

(5) Han Gupu was entrusted to sell coal for various shipping companies, which is a commercial activity, and he did not purchase the coal himself, so it does not constitute bribery. (6) Regarding the five defendants Yang Yunfu, Sun Jice, Zhao Bojun, Lin Keying, and Zou Jidao, the evidence of bribery is conclusive, and they should be dealt with according to the law. The court adjourned at noon and resumed at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. Prosecutor Zheng Yanjun stood up and stated the prosecution's intentions. The defendants' defense lawyers, including Pan Zhenya, then presented their arguments in turn. The court finally questioned each of the defendants individually and scheduled the verdict to be announced on the 24th. Yang Yunfu and the other eleven defendants were remanded in custody, and Sun Zhigang was ordered to return.

### Public Utility Prices to Be Adjusted Automatically; Public Utilities Bureau Sends Personnel to Beijing to Request Instructions

It is reported that the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has agreed in principle and has sent personnel to Beijing last night to request instructions from the Executive Yuan, and they are expected to return to Shanghai tomorrow. If approved by the central government, it will be implemented in the short term. It is said that the new prices will increase by about two to three times.

### Sino-Japanese Air Route of China National Aviation Corporation Decided to Be Temporarily Shelved

[Report from Our Newspaper] The China National Aviation Corporation's planned Sino-Japanese air route was rumored to be opening at the end of last month, but it has not yet materialized. It has been learned that this plan has been decided to be temporarily shelved because the main purpose of opening the air route was to attract US military personnel stationed in Japan to travel to China. However, with the current war situation in the country, the United States is busy evacuating its citizens, and American personnel in Tokyo are unlikely to be interested in traveling to China at this time. Therefore, the opening of the Sino-Japanese air route would be meaningless, and the China National Aviation Corporation has decided to shelve it.

### Bureau of Education Disagrees with Private Schools' Increase in Tuition and Fees; Assistance Should Be Sought Through Other Means Due to Teachers' Hardship

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Private Primary and Secondary School Federation held a meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon at the Municipal Education Association to discuss the issue of increasing tuition and fees. Representatives from the faculty also attended. The faculty members spoke enthusiastically, believing that the Legislative Yuan has already approved adjustments to the salaries of public school teachers, which is vastly different from private schools. Therefore, the faculty demanded a surcharge exceeding four times the original amount. Director Li attended the meeting to advise them. The meeting ultimately decided that the surcharge should not exceed four times the original amount in principle, and the name of the fee would be determined by each school.

According to Director Li's statement to reporters, he does not agree with the four-fold increase in tuition and fees. The method of subsidizing the faculty's hardship should be discussed jointly by the school, student parents, and faculty members. Donations should be made voluntarily based on the parents' financial ability, and the amount cannot be rigidly stipulated.

### Many Municipal Secondary Schools Have Not Resumed Classes; Representatives' Congress to Be Held Today

### Municipal Primary School Faculty's Attitude to Depend on Municipal Secondary Schools

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Primary School Principals' and Faculty Association will hold a representatives' congress at the Sapo Sai Primary School at 3:00 PM this afternoon.

### Zheng Jie Issues Statement on Scholarship Issues

[Report from Our Newspaper] The presidents of various public and private universities and colleges in the city criticized the Municipal Department's Hang Vice-Minister at a meeting the day before yesterday for the delayed issuance of unified scholarships for this semester. The presidents of various private universities and colleges also decided to waive the scholarships. Zheng Jie, the secretary-general of the Shanghai Municipal Scholarship Unified Review Committee, issued the following statement yesterday: (1) The reason for the relatively late issuance of scholarships this semester is that the schools failed to submit application forms or lists of tuition-free students to the committee on time. For example, the application form from Daxia University has not yet been submitted, and the application form from Hujiang University has not been returned to the committee after being retrieved for re-examination. As for primary and secondary schools, many schools, including the attached high school of the Law School, have not yet submitted the list of tuition-free students, which has greatly affected the review work of the committee. (2) Chairman Pan Gongzhan and Vice-Chairman Li Ximou have always advocated that scholarship issuance procedures should be handled quickly. Therefore, despite their busy schedules with other official duties, they promptly reviewed the committee's official documents. As for myself and the four staff members of the committee, we have done our best to expedite the committee's affairs and do not believe there have been any delays on our part. (3) Although this semester's scholarships were individually donated by various groups at the International Hotel on August 27, all donations could not be collected immediately. As of now, some groups have not yet sent their donations. As for the safekeeping of scholarships, except for those kept by the donating groups themselves, the remaining funds are immediately deposited into the Municipal Bank upon receipt by the committee. Moreover, the committee's withdrawal procedures from the Municipal Bank require the seals of Vice-Chairman Li and myself. Chairman Pan does not manage the committee's donation receipts and expenditures. Furthermore, the committee's mission is to fulfill its responsibility to needy students at all levels of public and private schools, and even bank interest is allocated to scholarships. However, the current devaluation of the gold yuan was unexpected. (4) This semester's scholarships for needy students in public and private colleges and universities have been separately sent by the committee to the schools for distribution, and many schools, including the Lixin Accounting College, have already received the funds. In order to ensure that the scholarship distribution procedures of the committee and the donating groups are cautious, they are slightly stricter, which we hope will be understood by the schools.

### Jianghai Customs Announces Revisions to Regulations on Carrying Gold, Silver, and Foreign Currency Out of the Country

Transit or tourist passengers who still need to carry gold, silver, and foreign currency out of the country must declare them to the customs upon entry and hand them over to the Central Bank or its designated bank for safekeeping. They may be retrieved upon departure, but if they fail to request their return for carrying out of the country within six months of entry, they shall be exchanged for gold yuan or gold yuan notes at the prescribed rate. (3) Those who violate the provisions of items (1) and (2) shall have their gold, silver, silver coins, or foreign currency notes confiscated.

### On the Eve of the Household Registration Check, a Gang of Violent Robbers is Arrested; Confesses to Ten Cases in the City and Other Locations

[Report from Our Newspaper] At around 9:00 PM on the 8th, during the city-wide household registration check, Xu Dezhong, a patrol officer of the Criminal Division of the Songshan Road Police Station, led police officers Chen Fusheng, Liu Dengdi, Hao Wende, volunteer criminal police Fei Leimeng, Xu Yushi, Lu Huinu, etc., to conduct a check in the Dakang Lane on Jianguo East Road. They saw five people lingering in the alley, attempting to avoid the check. They immediately blocked their path, questioned them, and found their actions suspicious. They were taken to the police station for interrogation and it was discovered that they were indeed violent robbers. They confessed their names as Gao Zheng, Huang Shaoxiang, Chen Boqing, Zhu Liang, and Yu Jinghai. Section Chief Shen Zuoluo ordered the handling police officer to go to the home of the criminal Gao in the Yaojiaqiao shantytown on Tongbei Road and seize a pistol, eight bullets, a pure gold ring, and 58 silver coins. Gao was interrogated again and confessed that the gold ring and silver coins were all stolen goods. On the 15th, the police continued to apprehend three accomplices, Shi Fengzhu, Zhang Diancai, and Li Daiyueying (female), at 55 Saiyuan Lane, Yuezhou Road. They confessed to committing eight robberies in the city and two robberies in Chongming and Haimen. It is said that there are three more accomplices, Chen Guiqing, Zhang Xiaochu, and Wang Chengli, who have been arrested by the police in Haimen. It is reported that the gang of robbers used the guise of conducting a household registration check for each robbery. The gang leader, Gao Zheng, had a large following in the Haimen area of northern Jiangsu, and they all called Gao "Big Brother," which showed potential influence. The police had long intended to arrest him, and he was finally captured unintentionally, which can be said to be a case of the mills of justice grinding slowly but surely. There are also three receivers of stolen goods: Gu Yutang of the Lu Tianbao Silver Shop on Xizang Road, Zhu Xiquan of the Xinbinfeng Silver Shop at 953 Jiaozhou Road, and Wu Junda, a pawnbroker at 1 Lane 881 Haining Road, who were also apprehended one after another, and part of the stolen goods were seized. The police are asking the owners to identify their stolen goods. The case has been fully investigated, and the criminals are scheduled to be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation this morning.

In the other two games last night, the Class A team, Swatow, defeated New Life with a score of sixty-one to forty-four, the first half ending twenty-five to sixteen. In the Class B game, Tie Lian defeated Tai Kang Hei, twenty-four to seventeen, the first half ending fifteen to six.

The Chinese Youth Basketball Hall was packed with over eight hundred fans last night, an unprecedented spectacle for the Chinese Youth. Morning Friends' victory was due to their familiarity with the court, their tacit cooperation, and their ample strength. Wang Boyuan gave a particularly outstanding performance, scoring twenty-four points alone. H威力's performance was greatly below par, their luck with the ball was poor, and they repeatedly missed shots. Their tactics encountered difficulties on the small court of the Chinese Youth and could not be effectively deployed. Moreover, their formation was chaotic, and they failed to contain Wang Boyuan, allowing Morning Friends to penetrate their defense with ease. If they can maintain their composure from now on, there may still be a glimmer of hope.

Morning Friends' Shooting: As if Divinely Assisted

H威力's starting lineup was: Wang, Cao, Tian, Zhang, Wei. Morning Friends' lineup was: He, Fu, Liang, and two Wangs. Wang Rong scored the first points with seven jump shots. H威力's Wang Yongfang made all his free throws. Morning Friends' Liang Xiong biao made two layups, giving Morning Friends an early lead and maintaining it throughout the game. H威力 repeatedly failed to score. At fourteen to eight, H威力 called a timeout. The situation gradually became more balanced, and H威力 chased the score, tying it at sixteen. The battle reached its climax, with both sides attacking at a high speed and putting on a very exciting show. However, Morning Friends' score began to rise again. Boyuan and Weibiao's shooting seemed divinely assisted. H威力 appeared slightly flustered. In the first half, Morning Friends led by ten points, thirty-three to twenty-three.

H威力's Counterattack: Ineffective

After the break, Morning Friends' momentum did not wane, and they continued to advance. At forty-six to thirty, the difference became increasingly large. H威力 substituted Shang Chongyue for Tian Fuhai and launched a desperate counterattack, but failed to alleviate the pressure from Morning Friends. At fifty-two to thirty-eight, Fu Qixia was fouled out for the fifth time and replaced by Sun Moses. H威力 also brought Zhang Pu and Tian Fuhai back in. The score began to narrow slightly, but Sun Moses scored on a steal, and they fell behind again. The final score was sixty-six to fifty-one, a difference of fifteen points.

### Implementation Details Slightly Revised: Gold and Silver Exchange Begins on Monday; Gold and Silver Reserves Valued at 12 Billion; Finance Minister Xu Kan Arrives in Shanghai from Nanjing Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] The implementation details for the exchange of gold and silver for deposits were taken to Nanjing for instructions by Liu Gongyun on the 16th. Liu has already returned to Shanghai yesterday. It is reported that there are still some revisions to the implementation details, but the date of commencement of the exchange has been decided as next Monday. Unless there are unexpected reasons, there will be no changes.

The person in charge of the Central Bank convened a meeting of the heads of the Bank of Communications, the Central Farmers Bank, and the China Development Bank at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday to discuss the exchange procedures for the substitute exchange banks. According to the Central Bank's current gold reserves of approximately 5 million taels and 100 million silver dollars, if all were exchanged, it could recover 12 billion gold yuan.

[Our Dispatch] Finance Minister Xu Kan flew to Shanghai from Nanjing at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. After arriving, he immediately held discussions with Yu Hongjun and Liu Gongyun, reportedly related to the exchange of gold and silver and the issue of increasing the capital of financial institutions. Xu is scheduled to host a reception for reporters at 5:00 PM this afternoon, where he will make a report.

[Our Dispatch] The import and export trade linkage measures were taken to the Executive Yuan in Nanjing by Shao Huihua, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, and others. They have returned to Shanghai after completing the process. The implementation issue is currently being discussed with the Transportation and Management Committee. It is expected that the full text of the measures will be announced today.

[Our Dispatch] The Jianghua Company's Huayuan ship returned to Shanghai from Chongqing yesterday afternoon, carrying 674 boxes of silver dollars. These were reported for shipment by the Central Bank. After arriving in Shanghai, Yuanhe Public Transportation Company was responsible for customs declaration and delivery.

### Yarn Market Trends Downward

Cotton Cloth Asking Prices Rise and Then Soften

Due to the great victory of the National Army in Xuzhou, the yarn market became pessimistic. Scattering increased, and selling began again. Asking prices in the market stepped down. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was quoted at 9,450 yuan. Tomorrow's release was 10,200-10,300 yuan, but there were few buyers. Finally, it was released at 9,800 yuan, leveling with the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix also stepped down to 8,700 yuan at the close.

32-count Silver Moon 8,000 yuan, 21-count Double Horse 6,800 yuan, 20-count Jincheng 6,300 yuan, 16-count Guangming 6,700 yuan, 10-count Boy Scout 4,000 yuan. Throughout the day, the prices of all counts of coarse and fine yarn were generally lower than the previous day, ranging from 100-200 yuan to 600-700 yuan.

Another Report: The cotton yarn market was temporarily closed for trading yesterday. No trading took place in the market. The reason for the temporary closure was that the entry permits had not been completely exchanged. For several days after the market opened, the front door was not open, and personnel entering the market were entering and exiting through the back door. The authorities corrected this, so trading was temporarily suspended yesterday. Personnel arriving at the market were trading outside the market. Market conditions were smaller than yesterday.

Yesterday, cotton cloth asking prices outside the market continued to decline following the previous day's weakness. 12-yard Nengtou fine cloth initially asked for 300 yuan, briefly declining to 290 yuan. Later, as credit conditions eased, buyers took advantage of the low prices to make purchases, and local retail sales also came to replenish stocks. Sellers, hearing that rice prices were rising, were mostly unwilling to sell lightly. At midday, prices stepped up to 320 yuan at the close, recovering 10 yuan from the previous day. Four Gentlemen yuan beiji also improved 15 yuan, to 330 yuan. After the close, hearing that yarn prices were trending down, sentiment weakened again. 320 yuan for Longtou fine cloth found no buyers.

### Cotton Market Flat and Soft

The spot cotton market remained flat yesterday. Cotton yarn trended weak, and factories showed no interest. The Joint Purchasing Association absorbed a small amount. Prices were slightly weak. Zhoupu seed cotton continued to trade at 280-300 yuan.

### Credit Conditions Ease: Ample Funds

Yesterday, credit conditions trended loose and harmonious. The supply of funds in the market was very strong. Although there were also many demanders, turnover was exceptionally flexible. The hidden interest rate was between 7.5 and 9 jiao per month. Cash funds were particularly ample. Financial institutions uniformly increased the withdrawal limits.

### Overseas Remittance Income Increases Sharply

[Our Dispatch] Since the implementation of the revised measures for the gold yuan, overseas remittance income has increased sharply. As of the 15th of this month, the Nanyang overseas remittances received by the Xiamen branch of the Bank of China alone reached a substantial amount of 1.5 million US dollars and 6,000 Hong Kong dollars.

Another Report: The Ministry of Finance convened a meeting in Nanjing on the 13th of this month to discuss the issue of using special foreign currency certificates of deposit. Representatives from the Central Trust Bureau and the Transportation Management Committee of the China Industrial Corporation attended. After the measures were agreed upon, they were submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is understood that, in principle, the portion of the government's compulsory purchase can be fully used, while the portion allocated for sale will be given at the official price.

### Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Weaving Manufacturers Come to Shanghai: Requesting a Reduction in the Allocated Price of Artificial Silk

The Central Trust Bureau allocated the 80th installment of rayon to silk weaving manufacturers in various regions last week. Because the fixed price was too high and market prices were frequently falling, the silk weaving manufacturers did not go to collect their allocations. They unanimously requested the Central Trust Bureau to reduce the allocated price. According to the regulations of the Executive Yuan, it should be calculated at 80% of the market price, but the Central Trust Bureau has not yet agreed. Silk weaving manufacturers from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces sent representatives to Shanghai yesterday to meet with silk weaving manufacturers in Shanghai to negotiate with the Central Trust Bureau today to request a reduction in the allocated price and continue the allocation, in order to avoid fueling rampant black market silk weaving prices during the suspension period.

### Office of the Supervisory Commissioner: Can Be Closed by the Beginning of Next Week

[Our Dispatch] Since the government changed its policies, the Office of the Economic Management Supervisory Commissioner in this city has been working to close all cases handled in the past, and it is expected that all cases can be completed by the beginning of next week. As for the case of exchanging 20,000 bolts of cotton cloth for rice, the account books and documents of the rice merchants have not yet been submitted, so it is still impossible to complete the closing work.

### Sugar Market Calm

Because the Taiwan Sugar Company's allocated quantity of Taiqi sugar was slightly more than the previous installment, local buyers' stomachs were saturated, and market sentiment was stable. The various other commodities were mostly weak, and local retail sales were sluggish. In the market, supply and demand were balanced, and the trend was calm, with no drastic fluctuations from the opening to the closing of the market.

### Demand From All Sides is Very Strong: Rice Continues to Rise

Yesterday, rice prices continued to rise. White geng was approaching seven guan. Although the supply to the market was smoother than before, merchants took the opportunity to support prices because of strong demand from all sides, and the market trend rose sharply. Yesterday, the markets for various industries outside the rice market all fell, but rice prices alone rose, because some rice shops still did not sell rice widely, and after the cost of living index was released, some employees bought food after receiving their salaries. Because supply was less than demand, market prices rose again. However, rice prices in the surrounding rural areas were still cheap, and rice prices at the place of origin were also between 300 and 400 yuan. In theory, rice prices in the Shanghai market should not rise sharply.

Yesterday, 1476 shi and 6 dou of goods arrived at the South Market, and trading was brisk. White geng traded at 600 yuan, thin rice at 600 yuan, and early rice at 580 yuan. More goods arrived at the North Market, totaling 1910 shi, and the opening prices were higher than those in the South Market, with white geng at 660 yuan, thin rice at 680 yuan, and early rice at 680 yuan, an average increase of about 30-40%.

Because of fluctuations in rice prices, the flour market saw strong retail sales and strong buying interest, and market prices rose uniformly. Laoche flour initially opened at a high price of 200 yuan, but because its price exceeded yesterday's by 40 yuan, hoarders took advantage of the high prices to sell, and market prices turned weak, closing at 185 yuan. Delivered Laoche flour traded at 193 yuan. Bingship flour opened at 200 yuan and closed at 180 yuan, an increase of 30 yuan from yesterday's market. Delivered traded at 190 yuan. Other brands, such as Peacock 187 yuan, Lighthouse 195 yuan, Red Bee 175 yuan, and Jiancheng 177 yuan, all uniformly rose by about 20%. Bran turned strong. Fuxin Fufeng opened at 130 yuan, with a highest price of 145 yuan to 140 yuan, closing at 118 yuan.

The prices of miscellaneous grains uniformly rose, and trading was slightly more active. Corn rose by 25 yuan, peanuts rose by 40 yuan, and soybeans rose by 40 yuan to 60 yuan, etc.

Due to the rise in commodities outside the market and the increase in retail sales in the oil market, the price of pure raw oil from the local factory was 1150 yuan, an increase of 100 yuan from yesterday's market. Raw vegetable oil opened at a high price of 820 yuan, but the subsequent market weakened to 750 yuan at the close. Cooked vegetable oil traded quite a bit at 700 yuan. Soybean oil from the local factory opened at 950 yuan. After the opening, hoarders sold off a lot, and the subsequent market fell back to 880 yuan. Changzi bean cake was 82 yuan, also up 10 yuan from before.

### New Atmosphere in Lin'an: Climbing to the Eastern Tianmu Mountain

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Chu Yusheng

[Our Dispatch from Hangzhou, 16th] Traveling west from Hangzhou along the Hanghui Road, passing through Yuhang to reach Lin'an, I had traveled this road at the end of the summer of 1946. At that time, the highway was dilapidated, and the towns were almost completely destroyed by artillery fire. The broken ruins were a terrible sight. This time, I was invited by the location scouting team of the China Electric No. 1 Factory's "Searching for Dreams" film, and I was able to revisit this old place. In the two years since I had last been here, the dilapidated highway had been transformed into a flat road, and the chaotic places had become orderly. In particular, the newly emerging municipal construction in Lin'an County had transformed the dilapidated county government office into a new, magnificent county government office. The destroyed streets had been rebuilt into flat roads, and the houses that had been burned and demolished were being rebuilt along both sides of the road. Most commendably, it was impossible to find a single beggar in Lin'an City. Shops opened at 6:00 AM and closed at 10:00 PM. Amidst the current economic turmoil, it was truly a Shangri-La rarely seen in cities.

85% Harvest This Year

The counties of Yu, Lin, Yu, and Chang all had bumper harvests this year. Lin'an had more than 85%. The best income came from tea, because Longjing tea was selling well this year, and tea merchants came to Lin'an to purchase tea for sale as Longjing tea. Next was silk floss. This year, cocoons sold for a lot of money. One dan was enough to exchange for several dan of rice. Bamboo shoots also sold well. Although the output of sand peaches and green beans was not high, they also generated good income. The increased value of goods produced in the countryside guaranteed the peace and tranquility of Lin'an.

County Magistrate Yang Weili told me: "If you want to run the county government well, you must have sufficient tax revenue. To have sufficient tax revenue, you must eliminate tax evasion. When paying taxes in Lin'an, I am the first to pay the taxes that I owe myself. This makes it embarrassing for everyone not to pay. If there are still people who deliberately fail to pay, they will be severely punished. Therefore, the collection of land tax, house tax, business tax, and slaughter tax in Lin'an is quite good.

Loans to Build Houses

"Regarding local construction projects, we will never impose levies on the local people. For example, the construction of the county government office used the county government's surplus from the past two years. The repair of the roads also used this money. The county government loaned half of the funds to build the shops on both sides of the road, with grain as the loan object. The interest rate is only one jin of grain per dan and can be repaid in installments. The people are grateful for such low costs and naturally build houses.

"The rural roads have all been completed, using labor service during the agricultural off-season. Telephones have also been installed throughout the county. As for small-scale farmland irrigation, as long as the people apply, the county government will conduct a field survey and, if it is true, will lend grain for construction without any conditions."

Commissioner Tan of the Ninth District

Lin'an is the location of the Commissioner's Office of the Ninth District of Zhejiang Province. Commissioner Tan Naida used to be a division commander. He told me: "Nothing has happened in the Ninth District this year." Judging from the situation in Lin'an, it is indeed very peaceful, and the farmers are also able to get by.

Lin'an boasts the beauty of Eastern Tianmu Mountain (Note: Yuqian has Western Tianmu, which I visited in 1946 and wrote about). It is about 40 li from Lin'an County. The road from the city to Eastern Tianmu Mountain was built by the county government, which mobilized labor service. Cars can travel on it. Although the road surface is not as good as the highway, it is not easy to develop this road with the county's resources, especially with several dangerous construction projects along the way.

Arriving at Eastern Tianmu Mountain and Climbing the Mountain

As we approached Eastern Tianmu Mountain, we saw clusters of trees, piles of houses, heads of cattle, and flocks of chickens and ducks along the way. The fields had all been harvested, and the firewood was stacked neatly. White tea blossoms covered the tea bushes, and bamboos whispered in the wind.

We arrived at the foot of Eastern Tianmu Mountain and walked a little more than half a kilometer, ascending the mountain step by step. For every half kilometer climbed, there was a section of flat road. Arriving at Sanli Pavilion, we looked down at the mountains and the quiet villages, which were like paintings. The red leaves were abundant, interspersed with tender yellow and deep green branches and leaves.

Climbing further to Sili Pavilion and Wuli Pavilion, we saw a waterfall hanging in the distance, more than ten zhang long. Above Wuli Pavilion, people in the valley shouted, and the mountains echoed. At this time, we saw red leaves all over the mountains, blood-red azaleas, and Nandina domestica like red beans. Pines and junipers occupied the mountains on all sides.

Zhaoming Temple is Like a Fairyland

Climbing another four li, we saw towering trees, all several arm spans in circumference. Further ahead, there was a stone bridge, ancient and mottled, with moss covering the steps. Next to the bridge was a pavilion. In front of the bridge was a stone wall with a hanging waterfall. We passed under the bridge and entered a deep ravine. We crossed the bridge and climbed up the steps. Beside the mountain was a pavilion. Further up, there was a forest of giant trees, and under the forest was a stone path leading to Zhaoming Temple. The grand sound of a bell struck deep into our hearts, and we felt as if we had entered a "fairyland."

The temple was very large, capable of accommodating thousands of people. The Buddha statues were not as grand as those at Lingyin and Jingci Temples, but many people came from Fuyang and other counties to fulfill vows and burn incense, and all stayed at the temple. According to the old monk, "There were electric lights before the war. The generator was donated by Mei Lanfang, and Cai Yuanpei also came here." We went to the Washing Eyes Pond, where Prince Zhaoming washed his eyes. Prince Zhaoming compiled scriptures in Eastern Tianmu, and his eyes went blind. He washed his eyes at the Washing Eyes Pond and regained his sight, hence the name. From here, we could see arhat pines growing on the opposite mountain peak.

China Electric Films the "Searching for Dreams" Film

I feel that the beauty of Eastern Tianmu lies in its elegance, while Western Tianmu has towering ancient trees, giving it a majestic atmosphere. China Electric No. 1 Factory filmed a newsreel here called "Autumn in Tianmu." Because of its excellent location, they came here specifically to film the location scenes for "Searching for Dreams." "Searching for Dreams" tells the story of a journalist, directed by Tang Huang and starring Du Lizhu. The county magistrate was very helpful and helped them find solutions to the problems of food, lodging, and accommodation.

The county magistrate also told me: "We are planning to build another highway to Western Tianmu." Then both Eastern and Western Tianmu can be visited from Lin'an.

During my two days in Lin'an, I truly felt that this county was very peaceful. I hope that it will strive for even greater progress in its peace.

### Stable Bengbu City

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Fei Chaoran

[Our Dispatch from Bengbu, 15th] Because our forces in Bengbu City are strong, people's hearts are exceptionally calm. Commerce, which had been stagnant for many days, is gradually recovering. The Victoria and National cinemas and other theaters are still operating as usual, and the audience is still extremely crowded. Li Yannian, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, convened a meeting of the heads of various agencies in Bengbu City on the 14th and announced 24 important points: All agency personnel are not allowed to take leave, and they must provide written guarantees of their thoughts and actions. The Bank of Communications, the Central Farmers Bank, and various flour mills must not suspend operations. The municipal government will organize rescue, transportation, and communication teams to assist the garrison in defense. A census will be conducted to prevent spies. Internal and external defenses of the urban area will be strengthened. Curfew in the city will begin early, at 9:30 PM every night, etc. Later, Deng Wenyi, Director of the Political Work Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, announced that there was indeed a good chance of victory in the Xuzhou campaign. Commander Hu reported that the city's forces were strong and that public order was absolutely guaranteed. The tracks on the Jinpu Railway from Shimenshan, Xiaoxihe, Zhanglaoying, and on the Huainan Railway from Xiatangji and Zhujiaxiang were successively blown up in small sections by bandits, but were quickly repaired and reopened. On the night of the 14th, the bridge near Wudian on the Huainan Railway was also burned by bandits. It is being repaired on the 15th and should be open to traffic on the 16th.

In recent days, prices have soared like wild horses. Rice is 300 yuan per shi, flour is 60 yuan per bag, pork is 8 yuan per jin, sesame oil is 8 yuan per jin, and other items have risen by seven or eight times. The common people are all crying out in pain. The trains on the various lines are not on time, and passengers are extremely crowded, to the point where there is no room to stand.

### From the Communist Army's Strength and Strategy: The Xuzhou-Bengbu Great Battle

— Yang Li

[Times Agency Dispatch] The Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign is another battle with the largest troop concentration in the Central China region since the Yellow River Flooded Area campaign. In the month or two prior to this, the Communists had been actively operating in the Huaihe region. Local Communist forces formed the Huaihe Military District, with Chen Qingxian, commander of the 12th Column of the Communist Army, as the military district commander. The Communist bandit troops of Jin Shaoshan, Wei Fenglou, Zhao Huichuan, and Sun Chuanjia grew from several thousand people to one or two tens of thousands of people each, attempting to occupy the areas on both sides of the Jinpu Railway and the areas on both banks of the Huaihe River, opening up a corridor to the Dabie Mountains, in order to lay the foundation for the Communist main forces to come south in the future. Therefore, after the Yellow River Flooded Area campaign, Liu Bocheng left behind seeds in this area. After the National Army launched encirclement and suppression operations in northern Jiangsu, two columns of Communist troops had fled back to southern Shandong, and one column remained in northern Jiangsu. The Yancheng-Funing area had never been completely pacified, and local Communist teams continued to operate on the north bank of the Yangtze River. Before the Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign, two columns from southern Shandong again fled back to northern Jiangsu. After Dongtai was captured, the Communists attempted to bypass and attack Taizhou and Baoying, isolating Gaoyou and Baoying and impeding the National Army's actions west of Hongze Lake. The Communist troops moving south also moved through the Lian-Shu area to Si County, Lingbi, Fengyang, and Xuyi and Tianchang, coordinating with the Communist troops in the Huaihe River region to complete the encirclement of Bengbu. Although this was mostly the activity of local Communist forces, it had a great impact on transportation to the rear, and their intentions could not be ignored.

Furthermore, looking at the strength and deployment of the Communist regular army: Chen Yi has five corps, a total of sixteen columns. Eleven columns may be used in Xuzhou-Bengbu, distributed in southern Shandong, the Jinpu front, and western Shandong. Liu Bocheng has twelve columns. Six columns may be used in Xuzhou-Bengbu, part in western Shandong and part in eastern Henan. Chen Geng has four columns in western Henan, and two columns may flee east. In total, the maximum number of Communist troops participating in the Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign is nineteen to twenty-one columns, with a force of 350,000 to 400,000 people. Gathering the main forces of the three Communist armies, its scale will not be larger than the Liaoxi campaign. After the National Army's forces have been assembled, they are more than twice the size of the Communist army. Combined with the convenience of transportation and supply lines, their mobility is greater than that of the Communist army. Therefore, launching an offensive with an inferior force is not allowed in the Communist strategy. "Do not fight a battle without a chance of winning" is what the Communists have repeatedly emphasized. In the Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign, can they still use the "human wave tactics" to fight? Therefore, there are few opportunities for a direct decisive battle in the Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign. The Communist attack method may adopt the following approaches: First, go south from southern Shandong, passing between Xuzhou and Haizhou, cut off the Xuzhou-Huaiyin transportation, and enter the west bank of Dao Hongze Lake, threatening Bengbu, or even advancing further south of Bengbu. Second, bypass the Yellow River Flooded Area from western Shandong, enter northern Anhui, and coordinate with local Communist forces to enter southern Anhui, threatening the left wing of Xuzhou-Bengbu. Third, a force may come east from the border between Henan and Hubei, re-enter the Dabie Mountains, advance to western Anhui, and threaten the Chaohu area. In summary, the Communist army is using the southern section of the Jinpu Railway as the strategic attack center. After a fierce offensive, it may adopt the tactics of "expanding the area," "isolating points," and "cutting off lines" to create a long-term disturbance in the Huaihe region and on both sides of Hongze Lake. It may also send a force of infantry across the Yangtze River between Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi to disturb the rear areas of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang, threatening the rear of Nanjing and Shanghai. A diversionary battle may also be launched in the outer areas of Wuhan or the southern section of the Pinghan Railway. Therefore, the Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign is a decisive battle between the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers. This decisive battle can determine the situation between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers. At the same time, this battlefield is on the periphery of Nanjing and Shanghai and can also be seen as the defense of Nanjing and Shanghai. The National Army is determined to win without defeat. It has prepared for two months in terms of time, and has abandoned unnecessary burdens in terms of strategy. As long as the main force of the National Army is intact, the ins and outs of the points and lines cannot determine the overall situation. In this decisive battle, if more than half of the Communist main forces can be annihilated, the points and lines abandoned south of the Yellow River can be recovered in a matter of time. The current problem is that the National Army has the confidence to annihilate the Communists. It depends on whether the citizens of Nanjing and Shanghai can provide the soldiers on the front lines with spiritual or material assistance. In particular, the rear must first seek stability for themselves. A victory in battle will solve all problems. The defense of Nanjing and Shanghai depends on this one battle!

### Prices Driving People Mad

Four Members of a Xi'an Family Throw Tiles at People Due to High Prices

[Our Xi'an dispatch from the 13th] Amidst cries of soaring prices, Bao Yuzhen, a forty-year-old butcher residing in Dapiyuan, Xi'an, and his family of four, were so deeply affected by the situation that they went insane. They climbed onto rooftops and threw tiles at people, doing so every night while shouting, "Do you have any gold yuan notes?" Disturbed and unable to sleep, neighbors have tied them up inside their home and are seeking medical attention.

### Destitute and Desperate - Urgent Job Seeker Appeals for Sympathy and Assistance

Hoping that kind-hearted people can find a way to offer job opportunities. Editor:

A month ago, I wrote a job application letter, and I am grateful for your kindness in publishing it in the service section.

A month has quickly passed, and apart from two friends who sympathized with me and provided me with financial assistance and sympathetic consolation, I still have not found a job.

The storms and waves of the past month have pushed my entire family to the brink of death. There is no rice at home, no vegetables, and no cotton clothes. My weak wife and the children crying all day, what should I do!

I urgently hope to find a job (I can do copying, stencil cutting, and English typing) to continue the life of my family. If you can give me another opportunity to publish and forward letters on my behalf, so that I can continue to support myself on this not-so-long journey of life, it would be an act of kindness equal to rebirth.

### Baby Theft Incident

— Thunder

Recently, a baby theft case occurred in Tianjin, the protagonist of which was a young woman, Han Guo Hongti, who pretended to be nine months pregnant (see this newspaper on the 14th of this month). In today's extremely difficult living conditions, what the young woman stole was not money, nor food, but a rather cumbersome baby. No wonder people generally find it "strange," and some even think it is a rather humorous comedy.

This is indeed a ready-made comedy material because it seems to have elements of lightness, humor, and a bit of unexpectedness. However, this is just the view of outsiders. In the heart of the lead actress, Han Guo Hongti, she not only does not feel the above atmosphere at all, but on the contrary, she is acting in an atmosphere of tension, terror, and excitement, this scene that seems to be a comedy on the surface, but is actually a genuine tragedy. Because the initiator of this incident is not Han Guo Hongti, who actually committed the theft, nor her family members, such as her aunt and husband. Its real director is an invisible and intangible potential force, a very strong potential force deeply hidden in the hearts of ordinary people. In a word: it is the lingering poison of the feudal system that has been traditional in our country for thousands of years.

The annotations of this remaining poison, found in the classics of sages, are: "There are three forms of unfilial piety, and having no descendants is the greatest"; "A mother is honored through her son"; "…: those without sons shall be expelled." In the past, even now, the traditional thinking of the Chinese people has always been accustomed to pushing all crimes onto the weak. (Recently, didn't we also see the movie "Weakness, thy name is woman"?) Therefore, the crime of "unfilial piety" is borne by women; the crime of not being "honored" because of having no "son" is also borne by women; even the crime of being "expelled" is naturally borne by women. "Blaming fate and not complaining," of course, has nothing to do with the husband.

For example, the clause "those without sons shall be expelled" no longer seems to constitute a condition for divorce. However, the husband can hold up the big hat of "having no descendants is the greatest" as a reason for taking concubines. From a legal point of view, it does violate current laws, but this law-breaking husband can easily obtain the forgiveness and sympathy of his family, the forgiveness and sympathy of society, and even the forgiveness and sympathy of his wife. In such cases, although the wife is not publicly "expelled," isn't it equivalent to being semi-publicly "expelled"? And such events, for people like us in our forties, who have heard and witnessed them, are really not few.

Based on the above analysis, plus what we may have heard and seen, we can get a glimpse of the pain in the heart of the lead actress in this comedy. Therefore, we cannot just see the light surface and ignore the sour content.

Now let's chew over the process of this fact. First, she "pretended to be pregnant, since February, and it has been more than nine months now"; second, she "went to Ma Daifu Hospital several times, asking for a baby, but to no avail"; third, she "went to the hospital again on the tenth, and in desperation, she stole a baby from the nursery and walked out"; fourth, she "falsely claimed that it was born by her cousin and was admitted to Tongde Hospital." (The original text is all from this newspaper)

This is the process of her performance in this comedy. From this process, we can see how painstaking she is. But who did it for her, who caused it? Can we still look at her with a comedic mood? Can we still add the crime of theft to her?

What kind of punishment should she receive legally for this incident? I don't understand. But if you say that she has a well-deserved crime, then this crime should be attributed to the remaining poison of the feudal system!

Who is to blame for this kind of thing still happening today?

### Talking About Qualifications

— A Dan

Civil servants, except for specially appointed officials who do not consider qualifications, others, from employees to senior officials, all need to talk about qualifications. The person in charge of personnel can report to the superior authority for qualification and salary determination based on qualifications. However, the items listed on this "Civil Servant Resume Form" make people who are new to officialdom feel very troublesome.

Name, alias, gender, address (divided into present and permanent), date of birth, must specify the year, month, and day of the Republic of China, current age, party affiliation, and religious belief must also be filled in. Doctor's physical examination, divided into: height, left and right eyes and ears, chest circumference surplus and deficiency difference, limbs, heart, blood pressure, physical characteristics, lungs, others, overall evaluation, etc. Family members are divided into name, age, alive or dead, occupation, and notes. Education must specify the name of the school or training institution, department, start and end years of study, graduation or肄業, and degree. Examinations are also divided into year and name, type of subject, grade, certificate number, and examination authority. Name of writings or inventions, academic category. Specialty, interests, or rewards and punishments received must also be written clearly, and four photos must be attached.

Job assignment and salary depend on experience. All previous experience must be reported. However, qualifications for positions held under the Beijing government before 1927 cannot be written in. Writing it in does not count. Experience is divided into service agency name, position, duties, grade salary, date of arrival, date of resignation, and name of certificate, etc. The most important thing is the resignation certificate. If there is only a dispatch order for arrival and no resignation certificate, then even if you have done a long job for ten or eight years, it will only be counted as one month. There is also the銓叙 process, the number of steps to fill in, if not, naturally, you can not fill in. And in a resume form, in addition to the signature and seal of the person, the signature and seal of the head of the agency and the person in charge of personnel are also required. At the same time, two civil servants with higher positions than the person must sign a letter of guarantee before the formalities are completed and you are officially a civil servant.

Graduates with a high school degree, the initial salary is 75 yuan, and those with a junior college degree or above are 140 yuan. If you start from a university graduate and want to reach a荐任 position, it takes seven years, and to reach a簡任 position, it takes seventeen years. These years must be uninterrupted work, and the assessment can be promoted. Otherwise, even if you hold a certain position and receive a certain level of salary, it is a matter for this agency, and the銓叙 will not pass.

The qualifications of overseas Chinese affairs, Mongolian and Tibetan committees, and secretaries-general and secretaries of various agencies are not limited, which is special.

If the certificates for the War of Resistance are lost, the proof of the principal, teacher, or classmate, or former superior colleague, can be used as an official certificate, but the service agency of the person issuing the certificate must be stamped with a seal. Because there is this flexible approach, countless false certificates are produced. Some people, for the sake of friendship, "do good to others," then prove that someone has held a certain position and received a certain salary, etc. Personnel managers know the falsehood, and most do not pursue it. Therefore, during the War of Resistance, countless civil servants' salaries increased. If there are real lost certificates that cannot be obtained, and are downgraded, this is really "deserved" and has nothing to do with others.

### Frost

— Xi Hou

"The thinnest is the autumn frost." When I was young, after hearing this sentence, I had a deep impression of the emptiness and harshness of autumn frost. Compared to near middle age, not only are the grasses withered and the trees bare, and the seasons are alarming; but even the delicate jade and pearl rice are cooked, and the clothes are wide and the belt is left over, I also deeply feel the autumn frost-like taste of the world.

In fact, the frost in nature is solemn and beautiful. Although it is not as lively as the sound of rain, or as easygoing as the moonlight; but when you get up early on a clear autumn day and look out the window, the tiles are tiled, white and black, like a pattern, as if you are in an art class. At this time, the streets are silent, only the magpies on the treetops, pecking at the first sunlight. Soon, the morning light sprinkles on the house, and the slight traces disappear darkly, and the shady places appear even more white. Few people are willing to appreciate this kind of scenery early in the morning.

In the thick autumn morning fog, walking in the fields, covered with frost, stepping on the frozen soil, between the broken grass and rubble, shallow footprints remain, gradually feeling the sunrise and the fog thinning; the collars and sleeves are cold and warm, the sparse forest is red and green, the narrow path is winding, the firewood doors are closed in the cold, and the茅亭is covered in white. "No one is in the lonely mountains, and the falling leaves make a dry sound." This is a broken sentence from an old mountain residence. I only hate not being able to be on the border of a remote fortress, hearing the dawn horn.

When I was a guest in Hankou, I first learned to compose lyrics, and I once used the tune "Cui Lou Yin" to sing about frost. The topic was very new, and few people had written about it. Later, I read "Hui Feng Ci" and found this topic. The Guizhou poet Zhou Yuhuang also had a collection of "Poems about Frost from One Word to Seven Words," with the concluding sentence being "Nothing can be sold except the center of the mirror." I remember that my clumsy words had "A wisp of flying soul, taking advantage of the small sideburns and yellow flowers, sticking with fragrance." Also, "Sorrowfully, the people on the Banqiao Bridge are far away, and it is impossible to find them again." They were all extremely naive. At that time, I asked Mr. Wang Zhupu for advice, and I was also given a harmonious demonstration. Now I silently remember Wang's words below:

The wild geese carry sorrow, the crickets talk about coldness, the west wind is thin and the yellow flowers are. The perching birds startled the moon, choking the flute, the coldness sneaking through. Threads of fragrant heart, ask the little Yunying, how long have you been holding on? Pavilion interest, Lin Fei纈, pointing to the red砧 woman. Recognize it, shallow grass pond, a small mandarin duck first arrived, dawn traces added. Stealing red maple leaves; it is also white 收 芦絮. Emei暗妒, calculate off 婵娟, the moon shame 斜去. Heaven should allow, deceiving Pan 岳, 负奋恋舞. (Cui Lou Yin)

Now, after nineteen years, having experienced the vicissitudes of life, I have long been in danger and have no words. The autumn wind is on the sea, the view is bleak, remembering the old and thinking of the people, unconsciously my temples are starry.

### Remembering Wu Shuangya

— Chen Zuogao

The eclectic master Wu Shuangya (named Mei, courtesy name Qu'an, Shuangya is his hao), wrote and possessed the strengths of composing lyrics, making scores, and measuring voices. He was particularly rich in nationalistic ideas throughout his life. At first, he learned to write songs, mostly asking his friend Wu Cuilun (named Youxiao) to fill in the gongchi. In the year of Gui Mao, he began to write "Blood Flower Flying" (a legendary name), writing about the bloody events of the revolution, implying the massacre in the Tartar court and the slaughter of all barbarian races. At that time, Qu'an's father was still alive, fearing disaster, so he burned it. He said that later, in the year of Jia Chen, he wrote "Wind Cave Mountain," and in the year of Bing Wu, he wrote "Warming Fragrance Building" (both legendary names). He received guidance from Huang Moses, and his learning improved day by day, while Pan Yangchun guided him in advance. What he saw and heard, and what he gained from making friends, was compiled into "She Motha Room Song Talk." In his own inscription on the legend of "Wind Cave Mountain," he said: "Well, well, Tang Tang swallows ancient sorrow, Hong Ya himself 按 梁州, Moling Mountain color 珠江 moon, not抵崖山 a leaf boat." It is said that Emperor Sizong of Ming committed suicide, and the people of the southeast, calmly did their best, and the cabinet minister Lin Gui, swore an oath, and the feelings of passion were overflowing.

He was a descendant of Wu Qingfang (named Zhongjun), a member of the Hanlin Academy of the late Qing Dynasty, and was of the same clan as Wu Weiru (Yusheng). One was registered in Changzhou, and the other was registered in Yuanhe. Both of them inherited family instructions and encouraged each other with integrity, generation after generation. In the years of Ji Ji and Geng Wu, he resigned from the professorship of Zhongda University and responded to the invitation of Mr. Wang in Shanghai to teach his children. He drank a bottle of brandy and listened to茄立克 every day. The guests and hosts rejoiced, and the southeast was beautiful. Later, he left for other reasons. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he moved west with the government. He traveled long distances and endured hardships. Finally, he ended up in Dayao County, Yunnan. Then, he was trapped by the loss of his voice, and accumulated illnesses and could not get up. He died at the home of his disciple Li Yiping, and was temporarily buried in the back garden of the Li family. According to Huang Xiaozhi Xiangjian (Zi Duanmu) of the Ming Dynasty, his father Kong Zhao, once served as the magistrate of Dayao County. When the Ming Dynasty was about to perish, the passes were blocked, and Xiaozhi traveled alone for thousands of miles to reach the county to find his relatives. These two people, both came to this land, "loyal to the country, a filial to relatives, worthy of 후선표병." Three years after his death, his disciples Xu Yifan and others initiated a third anniversary sacrifice in Shanghai, and exhibited his posthumous works and practiced singing posthumous songs. For a time, Guan Yan gathered and mourned together.

### Chickens Wearing Glasses

— Qiang

Don't think that chickens are gentle birds. In fact, they are inherently combative. The spurs on the legs of roosters are specially used as kicking hooks, and the weapons of hens are their sharp calls. Fights between chickens can cause bloodshed at the slightest, and death at the worst, which is a great loss to the owners of chicken farms. One of the tools to prevent chicken fights is a special kind of glasses. These glasses are made of aluminum and artificial ivory. After they are placed on the chicken's eyes, the chicken's field of vision is restricted; it can only see to the sides, and cannot see straight ahead. Since it cannot see ahead, the chickens cannot fight each other.

### Lushan Misty Clouds

— Gu Ting

### A Trip to Qibao

— Zhang Yiqu

Twice a year, I go on an outing: Taowu is fragrant and Jupu is quiet; the seasons change with the flowers and trees, and I take my children to recognize spring and autumn (spring outing to Longhua, autumn outing to Qibao, both with my children).

The villagers scoop water and talk about the harvest, draining the pond to fish is a struggle for food; the eyes are full of 涸 　 regardless of size, also helping each other with saliva to live (on the way to Qibao, seeing farmers scooping water to fish).

Looking at the southern and northern fields, hundreds of acres are all good fields. Shennong is not a myth after all. Who said that farming has lost its secrets (Qibao has a new agricultural school, reclaiming hundreds of acres of land)?

I leave a cup of Beihai at will, and the chrysanthemums can entertain the wine, and the host is busy; countless碎黄贞白 autumns, drunk eyes still pity the green buds (President Chai Zifei of the agricultural school left wine to enjoy the chrysanthemums, among which green chrysanthemums are the most precious).

### Eulogy for Mr. Bu Lei

— Cangbo

Blood and tears accompany the loyal soul, the country is safe;

Life and death are related to great plans, the society has spirit.
