### President Reaffirms Determination to Suppress Rebellion; Will Personally Preside Over Memorial Week and Deliver Instructions Today; To Convene Central Political Committee Meeting to Review the Current Situation

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 7th] President Chiang will personally preside over the Kuomintang Central Memorial Week and deliver instructions. The content will reaffirm the determination and significance of suppressing the rebellion, emphasizing that rumors of peace with the communists are not to be believed. It is hoped that all compatriots nationwide can act in unison to continue the military campaign to complete the suppression of the rebellion. Following the Memorial Week, a meeting of the Central Political Committee will be held, during which the current situation will also be reviewed.

["United Press, Nanjing, 7th"] President Chiang will deliver a major policy speech on the morning of the 8th, clarifying the government's consistent determination to suppress the rebellion to the end. At the same time, President Chiang will make sweeping changes in diplomatic and domestic policies, and loosen his personal management of political affairs. Well-informed sources say that when the President delivers this speech at the Memorial Week on the 8th, he will call on the entire nation to quell the Chinese Communists and emphasize confidence in final victory. The policy changes are said to include the following three items:

(1) The President will relax his management of national political affairs, giving regional commanders full authority to handle military affairs without interference, and promoting the existence of a true responsible cabinet.

(2) The government will take a tough stance against "bureaucratic capital" and "powerful families."

(3) Foreign policy towards the Soviet Union will be hardened, and cooperation with the West will be clearly defined.

The above changes are said to be the subject of a petition submitted to President Chiang by all members of the Control Yuan. The petition will be submitted to the President on the 8th and then made public. At the same time, the "Nanjing Evening News" reported that Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, is currently discussing with the Legislative Yuan Committee whether a number of legislators should go to the United States to "seek assistance." The newspaper said that no decision has been made so far. The above developments occurred after President Chiang held talks with senior party and government officials. The President's reaffirmation of his determination to suppress the rebellion on the 8th is intended to dilute the atmosphere of peace demanded by Chinese intellectuals. Many intellectuals, under the leadership of legislator Liu Butong, appealed to President Chiang and Mao Zedong on the 6th to stop the war and form a multi-party coalition government.

[United News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] It is learned that President Chiang summoned Zhang Zhizhong and Sun Ke for a meeting on the morning of the 7th before going to church with his wife for worship. All parties are now eagerly awaiting the President's report on the current situation during the Memorial Week on Monday.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 7th] Premier of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao, met with the President on the morning of the 7th to make a report. The President again expressed his intention to retain him in person regarding his resignation. It is learned that Weng's intention to resign has not changed, but while on indefinite leave, he will continue to be responsible for the affairs of the Executive Yuan until a new cabinet is formed. It is also learned that if Weng insists on resigning and cannot be retained, the party is still said to favor Zhang Qun as his successor, but Zhang has not yet expressed any consideration to accept the position.

### Situation of Stocks of the Yangzi Company

Executive Yuan's Reply to the Legislative Yuan

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 7th] The Executive Yuan replied to the Legislative Yuan regarding the inquiry made by a member of the Legislative Yuan on October 10th about the reason for handling the stocks of Shanghai Yangzi Jianye Company. According to the telegram and attachments dated the 29th from the Shanghai District Management and Supervision Office, Yangzi Company reported its inventory for registration on September 25th (the first day of the city-wide general registration and inspection of daily necessities in Shanghai). The office then handed it over to the Municipal Police Bureau for inspection, and after the police station reported the inspection results, it requested the bureau to handle it in accordance with the provisions of the general registration and inspection method, and to deal with any violations according to law. As for the inventory of Yangzi Company, the competent authorities have been notified to allocate and sell them to various manufacturers and general commercial firms at limited prices in accordance with the regulations. According to the reporter, this telegram was issued before the announcement of the supplementary measures for management and the abandonment of limited prices. The inventory list of Yangzi Company sealed on October 1st attached to the telegram includes more than 60 items of goods, including 2,563 boxes of Western medicine, 38 boxes of daily necessities, 93 boxes of cosmetics, 13 boxes of women's leather shoes, and 168 handbags. According to the police station's report, the inspection results showed that all the inventories, except for the boxed items that were difficult to count, were the same as the inventory list. The report also stated: "Some of the medicines (more than 1,000 boxes) are stored in an air-conditioned room, and some of the cod liver oil, etc., have deteriorated, but the storage time has been more than a year."

### US Adopts a Consistent Anti-Communist Policy; Will Help Me Recover the Northeast; Washington Diplomacy Experts Discuss

[United Press, Washington, 7th] Diplomacy experts said on the 7th that, contrary to outside criticism, President Truman supports effectively assisting China to avoid falling into the hands of the communists. Observers said that communism recognizes the United States as its greatest enemy, and the Communist Party is now attacking non-communist governments around the world. Truman and Congress, in view of this, will inevitably adopt a consistent policy of deterring communism. Some observers believe that, in the case of China, the US anti-communist policy may include assisting China in restoring its territorial integrity, including the recovery of the Northeast.

They pointed out that the United States is doing this partly because of the traditional US advocacy of China's right to independence and territorial integrity, and partly because the Northeast is a treasure trove of raw materials, and the restoration and development of the entire East depends on it.

### Military, Political and Economic Affairs of North China; Under the Overall Planning of Fu Zuoyi; Bai Chongxi Flew Back to Wuhan from Beijing Yesterday

[Our Beiping Correspondent, 7th] After Commander-in-Chief's journey south and return north, what changes will there be in the major plans for military and political affairs in North China? Because Fu and his associates are speaking cautiously, it has not yet become clear. It is only heard that after Fu returned, he once told people that after the military defeat in the Northeast, the situation in North China has become more serious than before, but if all sectors in North China can work together, it is an excellent opportunity to complete the suppression of the rebellion and build the country.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 7th] Bai Chongxi, Commander-in-Chief of the Central China Bandit Suppression, was summoned to Beijing for consultation by the President and flew back to Wuhan at 2:00 pm on the 7th.

### "Still Dreaming of Seeking Peace?" The Capital Central Daily Refutes the "Appeal for Peace" Argument

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] Several dozen professors from universities in the capital submitted a letter to President Chiang on the 5th, and also sent a letter to the Communist bandit Mao Zedong, appealing for peace. The Central Daily News here published an editorial on the 7th, refuting it, titled "Still Dreaming of Seeking Peace?" The full text is as follows:

Recently, the local military situation has been unfavorable, and the National Army, which has been isolated in the Northeast for many years, has suffered setbacks. The nerves of the general public are tense, which is a common phenomenon in any war. The suppression of the Communists is no exception. However, many intellectuals, especially a small number of university professors, are even more restless than ordinary citizens. They are flustered and take action. What do they express? The only magic weapon is "appealing for peace."

We firmly believe that university professors are responsible for imparting knowledge and stand at the forefront of the nation. Their personalities are outstanding. Therefore, the motivation for "appealing for peace" must stem from concern for the country and the people, and certainly not from a desire for opportunism. However, upon examining the content of their "appeal for peace," it is discovered that they are so ignorant of the historical development of China over the past century and the true state of the current situation in China, and so alienated and unclear, which is quite surprising.

What caused the turmoil in China today? As the saying goes, "Everything that happens is inevitable, and every reason has its justification." In recent years, Western powers have invaded the East with their incomparably strong economic, political, and military power. At this time, the internal "contradictions" of Chinese society have developed to a saturation point. The action of external forces has triggered internal problems. Thus, internal turmoil and external troubles have been like a pair of twins for a century, arising together, mutually generating each other, mutually benefiting each other, and mutually invading each other. The historical life of this ancient empire is on the verge of extinction. In this extremely difficult and painful process, knowledgeable intellectuals have risen up and launched reform and national salvation movements. Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao and other gentlemen advocated the Reform Movement first. After Kang and Liang failed six times, Sun Yat-sen continued the revolution. After the Xinhai Revolution, there was the Northern Expedition. After the Northern Expedition, there was the War of Resistance Against Japan. These successive undertakings led by intellectuals all aimed to achieve national independence, political freedom, and economic equality. We remember the serious sense of responsibility and the correct and far-sighted vision of the advanced intellectuals towards the nation, and comparing them with today, our admiration increases.

However, the forces of destruction and the forces seeking a way out for China are like demons following angels, inseparable, closely following the positive and affirmative changes. The great and small disturbances that have occurred constantly for a century, in addition to the Taiping Rebellion, include the Miao Rebellion, the Yunnan Rebellion, the Guanlong Rebellion, and the Xinjiang Rebellion. Now, there is the Communist Party disaster. The Communist Party disaster did not arise accidentally but was produced by the internal maladies of Chinese society being exploited by the Communist International. The Communist Party disaster did not begin today but has a long history, starting as early as 1927 when the Communist Party engaged in the so-called "Soviet Movement." The Communist Party engaged in the "Soviet Movement" for ten years, and as a result, it was utterly defeated and fled to the Northwest, on the verge of death. Later, under the guise of resisting Japan, it revived from the ashes, taking advantage of the exhaustion of the nation's vitality, the impoverishment of the people, the depletion of wealth, and the social unrest caused by the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. The current situation is a manifestation of the established policy of the Communist International and a concrete step in the Communist Party's attempt to achieve the goal of seizing national power by violence and establishing a "dictatorship of the proletariat." Since the essence of the situation is such, would it not be laughed at by Communist political conspirators to simply "appeal for peace"?

Some intellectuals are deluded by the current superficial phenomena, failing to see through the surface and discern the essence of things, confusing political shortcomings with the path the country should take. They believe that the current turmoil in the country is due to a struggle for power. It must be understood that today's armistice between us and the Communist Party is not about the transfer of power but about whether the nation is independent, whether the people are self-reliant, and whether cultural traditions continue. If, unfortunately, the Communist Party succeeds in its ambitions, then China will surely follow the weak and small countries of Eastern Europe and become an appendage of the strong, the people will be enslaved forever, without freedom, and historical and cultural traditions will inevitably be interrupted. Not only that, but the entire way of life will change. At the most critical juncture of the current suppression of Communists, "appealing for peace" is another name for advocating surrender. Advocating surrender to the Communist Party is also supporting China becoming an appendage of a foreign country, supporting the people being enslaved forever, supporting the abandonment of China's history and culture, and completely changing the way of life. Is this what those who are truly responsible and love the country and the people should do?

Perhaps some people believe that the people are currently suffering extremely, and regardless of who is right or wrong, the war should be stopped so that the people can rest and recuperate. The motivation of those who make this argument may be good, but on the one hand, they lack value judgment, and on the other hand, they do not understand the nature of the Communist Party, which is absolutely incompatible with peace.

Now, in the midst of the suppression of Communists, millions of people are displaced, and countless ordinary people's lives are plunged into extreme hardship. This phenomenon is worrying and distressing. However, on the one hand, it is due to the Communist Party expanding the unrest and wantonly destroying things, and on the other hand, it is caused by wealthy families and consortia using special political connections. Therefore, the people's suffering should only be blamed on the cooperation between the Communist Party and the rich. In general, the phenomenon of suffering during wartime is unavoidable in any war. There was also the phenomenon of people suffering during the War of Resistance Against Japan, but many people did not say that the War of Resistance Against Japan should not have been fought because the War of Resistance Against Japan was the right thing to do. The suppression of the Communists is essentially the same as resisting foreign aggression. How can we therefore demand an end to the suppression of Communists and surrender to the Communist Party by "appealing for peace"?

The Chinese Communist Party, like its Communist brothers who are actively active in many countries, is fundamentally combative in its theory and organization. The Communist Party is a follower of Heraclitus, their philosophy is "militant materialism," their central tenet is "class struggle," and their organization is a completely combative body. They use "rectification" and "purges" within the party, and show favor and win over outsiders before gradually settling scores and "struggling" against them. To hope for peace from such a group full of the nature of struggle is like climbing a tree to catch fish. These intellectuals are just shouting slogans of peace, while the government has tried to achieve peace with facts. Not only has it tried to achieve peace with facts, but it has also exchanged blood for peace. The facts of the past, at most two years, how can they be so forgetful? At the beginning of the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the government convened a Political Consultative Conference first, promulgated a military reorganization plan later, and issued three ceasefire orders. The National Army was beaten, and the five-person group and the three-person group were in a mess. In the end, it was all in vain. The Communist Party used these opportunities to overcome one military crisis after another and expanded and developed into a major disaster. When the Communist Party's strength was far less than it is today, it still had no sincerity for peace. Now, when its arrogance is in full swing, to hope that the Communist Party will stop the unrest and achieve peace is like daydreaming in broad daylight.

Intellectuals should have a serious sense of responsibility for the nation, and they should also have a correct understanding of the true state of reality and the future of history, and use true knowledge and insight to guide the times.

Editorial

### Shanghai Holds Population Census Today

Shanghai Municipality began a comprehensive household registration check today. The check time is from 9:00 PM to 2:00 AM the next morning, and it is expected to be completed in districts within four hours. This comprehensive household registration check, also known as the population census, is an initiative of unprecedented scale in the modern history of household administration in our country. The Shanghai Municipal Government's handling of the population census is well-planned and fully prepared, which is worthy of praise from the citizens. Prior to the announcement of the census time, the municipal government announced a "Outline for the Implementation of Household Registration Check, Reissuance of National Identification Cards, and Distribution of Purchase Certificates," ordering all levels of supervisors and citizens to comply. Several days before the check day, each baojia distributed new national identification cards and index cards with purchase certificates based on the household registration survey register, and each household filled them out in advance to prepare for on-the-spot verification and issuance of new certificates and collection of old certificates at the time of the check. At the same time, personnel participating in the census were trained and given household administration knowledge. Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan, etc., based on academic theory and facts, gave speeches to the citizens on the significance of the population census, so that the citizens could better understand the significance of implementing the new policy. Today is the day of the city-wide comprehensive entry check. Traffic has been controlled, and the census personnel have also been mobilized. The population of each jia and each household is well-known. Starting at 9:00 PM, they will remain stationary and wait for the arrival of the census personnel. This is a very gratifying thing.

The administrative and theoretical significance of the population census has been demonstrated in advanced countries. Kunming and Chongqing during the War of Resistance Against Japan also had brilliant achievements. This newspaper's editorial on October 9th has elaborated in detail. What we want to point out today is that in Shanghai, which is currently turbulent and uneasy due to the impact of changes in the war situation and the economic crisis, the emotions of most citizens are uneasy and their lives are chaotic. Under this state of unease and chaos, the effect of implementing a new policy related to livelihood will naturally be different from that in normal times. Therefore, we hope that the authorities, the census personnel, and all citizens will deal with it calmly, carefully, and patiently, and enthusiastically support it, and pay attention to the following points:

First, the population census is a static statistic, which takes the actual population as the criterion. There is no doubt about this in academic theory and statistics. However, the important purpose of this Shanghai Municipal population census is to reissue new national identification cards at the same time as the census, and the legal basis for the national identification card is the new Household Registration Law. According to the household registration survey referred to in the Household Registration Law, it is a dynamic statistic, which takes the legal entry as the criterion. The comprehensive household registration check held today, in principle, focuses on the "actual population on the spot," that is, the actual population. If there is a household registration, identification card, and a reliable certificate from the baojia proving that they are going out or traveling, it is hoped that they can also reissue new certificates according to the Household Registration Law, so as to avoid conflicts between laws and regulations and make citizens feel disappointed. This is a kind of technical flexibility, and it is hoped that the authorities and the census personnel will pay attention to it.

Second, the national identification card is a notarization of the people's nationality and identity, to show personal rights and obligations, and thus receive legal protection and government protection. This system is well implemented in advanced countries and has deep educational and civil rights significance. It is hoped that the citizens of Shanghai will not misunderstand and cause disturbances. The "National Identification Card Statement" and the date of birth and nationality on the card are related to personal rights and obligations, so they must be filled in accurately and must be consistent with the birth and nationality declared in the past household registration. Military service refers to serving in the military and military officer (adjutant) service, and compulsory labor refers to performing corvée, which are related to personal obligations and behavior, so they must be filled in accurately and must be consistent with the military service certificate. Do not make false reports, which will hinder the promotion of military service. In short, the citizens' statements must be accurate and credible. If there are any items that they do not understand, they can ask the baojia or the census personnel for explanation, so as to comply with the principle of accuracy and credibility. Third, the implementation of the population census is to facilitate administration. The importance that the citizens of Shanghai attach to the exchange of identification cards is due to the dazzling 144 shopping coupons. Every citizen hopes that after receiving the new card, they can purchase daily necessities with the card. It is heard that after the price limit is cancelled, the distribution of goods has not been completely abolished, but it is difficult to determine when it will be implemented. Therefore, it is hoped that the government authorities will immediately consider implementing the distribution of goods after the exchange of identification cards, so as not to disappoint the citizens and affect the implementation of any new policies in the future. Otherwise, this exchange of identification cards and issuance of purchase certificates will become an administrative waste, and will only be criticized for disturbing the people. This should not be ignored.

Fourth, the purpose of conducting the population census should be simple and should not involve anything else, so as to avoid harassment and leave a better impression of the new policy on the people. In the past, it was rumored that the "underground warehouses" would be investigated on the day of the check, which caused panic among the citizens. Later, the Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau issued a statement denying it, and the citizens' confusion was dispelled. The population census is a statistical work, and the implementation of this statistical work and educational work should not only not investigate the people's property and materials, but also should not hinder the people's freedom, and use excuses to arrest them, etc. In this Shanghai population census, the citizens are enthusiastically supporting and joyfully supporting it, which is a rare thing in the turbulent situation. It is hoped that there will be a good start and a good ending, and that a good impression will be preserved for the citizens in difficulty.

In short, the population census is a very important measure. The government and the citizens need to be patient and careful to complete this work smoothly. Do not let any complications arise, and do not cause disturbances. This is what we call for again.

### Molotov's Speech Has Moderate Wording: Sends Overtures to Truman; Criticizes Republican Party for Leading America to Adopt Adventurous Policies; Generally Believed that This Soviet Expression May Reopen the Door to Peace Talks

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 6th] The celebration of the 31st anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution was held at the Bolshoi Theatre at 7 PM tonight. All senior Soviet government officials, such as Molotov, Malenkov, and Voroshilov, attended, but Stalin was absent.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 6th, United Press] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov hinted that the Republican Party should be held responsible for the US's adoption of an "aggressive policy." Some people believe that Molotov's move is intended to open the door for peaceful negotiations with Truman to end the Cold War. Molotov's speech stated that Truman's re-election was due to the American people's opposition to the Republican Party's open aggression plan. On the issue of Japan, the Soviet Foreign Minister stated that Japan's war industry must be "completely eliminated." He also said that the Soviet Union was very dissatisfied with the long delay in concluding peace treaties with Japan and Germany, and that the Soviet Union could not turn a blind eye to the situation in Germany. It is because the United States, Britain, and France are fostering Nazi leaders in Germany and restoring their former status. Foreign observers here believe that Molotov's speech was relatively moderate. The speech did not make any new attacks on Western countries, implying that the hostility between the East and West worlds may ease. Molotov revealed the following seven points to the audience: (1) Stalin's interview with reporters from Pravda has pointed out a way for peace-loving people to crush anti-Soviet conspiracies. (2) The so-called Western European Union, the proposed Atlantic Alliance, and the possible Mediterranean Alliance are all part of the aggressor's war plan. (3) The Berlin crisis has not been resolved because the United States and Britain believe that their domination of the world has become a reality. (4) Britain and the United States are restoring Nazi power in Germany and abandoning various wartime agreements. (5) The Soviet Union's efforts in the United Nations to destroy the atomic bomb were obstructed by Western allies. The Soviet Union's proposal for major countries to reduce their armies by one-third has been rejected by the United States, Britain, France, and China. (7) The Marshall Plan has established several markets for the United States, making Western countries economically enslaved by the United States. Molotov also accused the United States of establishing military bases around the world and asked why the United States' military budget was eleven times higher than before the war. On the domestic front, Molotov said that the Soviet Union's current industrial production is 17% higher than the pre-war standard in 1940, and that Soviet heavy industry is now able to produce all kinds of machinery currently needed. The success of agriculture is also very significant.

### Neutral Country Representatives on the Security Council Advocate: Four-Power Summit; May Break Berlin Stalemate

[United Press, Paris, 6th] According to authoritative sources on the 6th, the neutral countries on the Security Council believe that it is necessary for the heads of the four powers to meet in order to resolve the Berlin crisis. They believe that only if Truman, Attlee, Queuille, and Stalin personally meet can the deadlock be finally broken. This meeting may also deal with other serious issues, such as atomic energy and the future of Germany.

Efforts by the United Nations to find a compromise solution have been blocked by the Soviet Union's use of the veto power. It is generally believed that a second failure will determine the fate of this world organization. President Truman's public expression of willingness to find a new basis for future negotiations with the Soviet Union is expected to generate a unified effort to resolve the Berlin issue. Neutral countries have also determined their position, because they believe that neither the East nor the West intends to start a war, and that both sides are willing to compromise if they can do so without losing face.

### Atlantic Alliance: France Plans to Submit Draft

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 6th] French experts are now extremely busy preparing to print the original text of the Atlantic Treaty drafted by France. This draft will greatly contribute to the upcoming consultations on the Atlantic Treaty. According to reliable sources, the French draft is a compromise between the Brussels Treaty and the Rio de Janeiro Treaty. Informed sources emphasized that the final form of the Atlantic Treaty will depend on several points that have not yet been discussed. The obligations stipulated in the treaty will obviously be flexible depending on the number of signatory countries. The provisions of the Atlantic Treaty are only an expression of free participation, and not all countries bordering the Atlantic must be bound by it, nor are all non-Atlantic neighboring countries excluded. This plan is based on the decision of the signatory countries' meeting of the Brussels Treaty held in Paris last time. After this, the Standing Committee of the five Western European countries will review the French draft and the drafts of other signatory countries. After the Standing Committee reaches a conclusion, it will convene a formal meeting with the United States and Canada.

### Egypt and Israel Conduct Ceasefire Negotiations; Egypt Proposes Two Conditions

### Truman Vacations in Key West, Florida: Officials in Washington Summon Heads of Departments and Will Compile Next Year's Tightened Fiscal Budget

[United Press, Washington, 7th] President Truman and his family took a special plane, "Independence," to Key West, Florida, for vacation today.

[United Press, Key West, Florida, 7th] President Truman is scheduled to arrive here today with his family for vacation, and the city is preparing a warm welcome. This is the President's fifth visit to this city, but the nature is different from the previous four times.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th, United Press] President Truman has formulated a policy of tightening expenditures for the fiscal year of 1950. According to Budget Director Webb, this budget will reduce federal spending to the lowest possible level. The above statement was announced after Truman consulted with cabinet members. Secretary of Defense Forrestal stated at the meeting that he did not intend to continue serving in the government. It is generally estimated that the budget for 1950 will be approximately 45 billion yuan. Webb said: The President ordered him to follow a tight budget policy.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th] President Truman, on the day after his return to Washington, which was also before his two-week vacation, separately summoned a large number of cabinet members. Those who were summoned and requested to visit the President included Acting Secretary of State Lovett, Secretary of the Navy Sullivan, Budget Director Webb, Secretary of Defense Forrestal, Secretary of Commerce Sawyer, and Secretary of the Treasury Snyder. Lovett and Truman met for half an hour. This meeting was considered the most important, especially since Lovett was not on the official list of visits to the President, and he entered and exited the White House through the side door, avoiding reporters. The White House and the State Department refused to comment on the meeting, which was held amid speculation in diplomatic circles. This speculation refers to the fact that the Soviet Union, ignoring the consensus on diplomatic issues called for by Republican and Democratic leaders after the election, has concentrated its efforts to break through the US bipartisan foreign policy. Lovett has put aside many extremely important diplomatic issues during the President's two-week absence, waiting for the election to end before making decisions. Lovett accompanied Ambassador Douglas to the UK, who returned to the US today for instructions, for a second visit with Truman. At the same time, the State Department did not comment on the news from Nanjing that Marshall had guaranteed that he would change the State Department's cold attitude towards aid to China in the future. People close to Truman said: Truman very much hopes that Marshall will decide to continue to serve, and Truman believes that Marshall is a great Secretary of State.

[United Press, Moscow, 7th] Soviet Defense Minister Bulganin issued a letter to the military today, pointing out that opponents of the Soviet Union's peaceful policies will inevitably fail.

### Vyshinsky Speaks at the Political Committee: Refutes Dulles's Remarks; US Building Bases Widely as Attack Targets

[United Press, Paris, 6th] Soviet representative Vyshinsky launched another general attack on Western countries in the Political Committee today. The focus of Vyshinsky's speech was to refute the remarks made yesterday by US representative Dulles, who claimed that the United States had stopped disarming because the world was afraid of the Soviet Union. Who is threatening the United States?

How does the Soviet Union threaten the United States? In fact, it is the United States, not the Soviet Union, that threatens other countries. The United States has two military bases in 28 locations in the Atlantic region alone. If the United States does not dream of controlling the world, why build so many bases around the world? To say that the United States does not want to control the world is just to deceive children. Vyshinsky also pointed out that British representative McNeil showed "strategic concern" for Greece. The Political Committee is scheduled to continue discussing the issues of Greece and the Balkans on the following day.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 6th] The Political Committee passed a resolution authorizing the chairman of the committee to negotiate with the Greek authorities regarding the impending execution of ten Greek labor leaders by a Greek military tribunal for rebellion.

When asked if he believed that the Soviet Union already had atomic bombs, Einstein replied: "Who knows? They may have it, but if they have atomic bombs, I think they may not be as effective as American atomic bombs."

The allocation quantity is still limited to 20 bags for direct users and 100 bags for sugar merchants. It is also reported that before being ordered to change the method, the company decided to allocate 10,000 tons per month as usual. The company currently has a sugar inventory of 38,000 tons in Shanghai. Furthermore, the Taiwan Xizhou Sugar Factory will start producing sugar within one or two weeks. It is expected that the new sugar will be available on the market and shipped to Shanghai in December of this year. Therefore, the company has full confidence in the sugar supply.

It is said that it will depend on the materials we need for barter. The Allied Headquarters in principle hope to export processed products, while we hope to import raw materials, so further negotiations are needed between the two parties. If a deal can be reached, the 100,000 tons of sugar will be shipped in the first half of next year.

### Confessions Obtained Through "Fatigue Interrogation" Cannot Be Used as the Basis for Judgment; Joint Proposal by Lawyer Zhou and Others

Zhou 馄 and more than 40 other members of the Shanghai Bar Association, recently, in view of the fact that police agencies in various parts of our country often adopt the so-called "fatigue interrogation" method, which continues for several days and nights, causing the offender to suffer from nervous breakdown and forcing confessions, which is an inhumane act.

### The Gold Control Bureau Announces the Financial Inspection Along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Line; 59 Banks and Money Shops Penalized for Violations

According to the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau, the Shanghai Financial Administration Bureau previously sent a large number of auditors to inspect the businesses of banks, money shops, and other financial institutions in Suzhou, Wujin, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and other places along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Line. The inspection reports have now been compiled separately. After detailed review by the bureau, penalties were proposed based on the severity of the circumstances, and were approved by the supervisor on the 5th of this month. It is estimated that the bureau inspected a large number of banks and money shops this time, including provincial banks, county banks, commercial banks, money shops, credit cooperatives, and underground money shops, totaling five categories. The number of institutions inspected included 1 head office of the provincial bank and 4 branches, 4 county banks, 22 commercial banks, 25 money shops, 14 credit cooperatives, and 3 underground money shops, totaling 59. Except for the credit cooperatives and underground money shops, which will be announced separately, the inspection results and penalties for provincial banks, county banks, and commercial banks and money shops are listed below:

Illegal Circumstances of Commercial Banks and Money Shops

(1) The illegal circumstances of the various commercial banks and money shops can be divided into: (1) establishing hidden accounts and secret ledgers; (2) managers, assistant managers, and staff of various departments using their authority to embezzle bank funds to engage in commerce; (3) concealing income and evading the payment of deposit reserves; (4) establishing branch offices in other cities without approval and engaging in private remittances; (5) discounting without recording or improper procedures; (6) not signing contracts for intercity remittances; (7) not collecting term loans beyond the limit; (8) using bank funds to hoard goods; (9) arbitrarily offsetting customer's accumulated bills before collection; (10) granting excessive credit loans; (11) accepting black market interest on deposits and loans; (12) improper accounting practices.

Wuxi and Zhenjiang Have the Most Serious Circumstances

The above-mentioned illegal circumstances all violate or are in breach of the relevant provisions of the "Banking Law," the "Measures for Restricting Loan Interest Rates," and the "Measures for Strengthening Financial Business Control." The Gold Control Bureau therefore imposed penalties in accordance with the penalty methods stipulated in the various laws and regulations. Among them, the most serious violations were found in the Wuxi Yuanfeng Renji Money Shop, Fuyuan Money Shop, and Zhenjiang Dingchang Money Shop, all of which were ordered to stop new business, stop clearing, and were handed over to the court for investigation. Those with relatively minor circumstances should be warned and their business corrected. There are 2 banks and 5 money shops. There should be further investigation. There are 1 bank and 3 money shops. The person in charge should be replaced and fined. There are 2 banks and 2 money shops. There should be a warning and a fine. There are 1 bank and 4 money shops. The person in charge should be replaced and handed over to the court for investigation. There is 1 money shop. There should be a fine and the person in charge should be replaced and handed over to the court for investigation. There are 2 banks and 7 money shops.

Replacement of Persons in Charge of County Banks in Four Locations

(2) After inspection of the county banks in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang, it was found that they either set up secret accounts to collect secret interest, colluded with customers to evade deposit reserves, embezzled treasury funds for other operations, or concealed income and recorded inaccurate accounts. Moreover, the senior officials in charge of each bank used their official positions to embezzle bank funds and engage in commerce and private lending. The circumstances of the crimes are significant and are in violation of Articles 33 and 43 of the Banking Law and Article 6 of the Measures for Strengthening Financial Business Control. In accordance with Article 13 of the Measures for Strengthening Financial Business Control, the persons in charge of each bank should be replaced, and operations should be improved in accordance with Article 11 of the County Banking Law in order to rectify the situation. The illegal personnel have also been instructed by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to investigate. Furthermore, the Wujin County Bank was previously ordered by the Ministry of Finance to replace the person in charge. In reality, the bank only replaced non-essential positions in an attempt to evade responsibility, showing negligence of official orders. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance has also been ordered to reorganize the board of directors to facilitate supervision.

Five Officials of the Agricultural Bank's Head Office and Branches Dismissed

(3) The Provincial Bank, namely the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank, was inspected. It was found in the head office and the Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang branches that (1) the person in charge or internal staff embezzled bank funds for illegal operations; (2) the loans were excessive and exceeded the business scope of the Provincial Bank; (3) the discount did not have legal transaction certificates and was not handled in accordance with the discount acceptance method; (4) when collecting money from customers, the customer's address was not investigated in advance, and the loans were all credit loans with incomplete procedures; (5) overdrafts, without signing contracts or complying with the overdraft limit, often exceeded the limit; (6) improper accounting practices. In addition to instructing the Jiangsu Provincial Government to dismiss Liu Xunwu, the head of the cashier section of the bank's head office, and Zhao Jieshan, Qiu Youxin, and Cheng Runzhen, the auditors, and to investigate Guo Shoudao, the deputy manager of the Wuxi branch, the Gold Control Bureau also ordered a thorough correction of the remaining irregularities in business and accounting.

### A-League Table Tennis Final; Jingwu Red Wins the Championship; Huamei Loses by a Narrow Margin of 4-5

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the final of the third Shanghai Table Tennis League Championship last night, Jingwu Red defeated Huamei 5-4 and won the championship. The process was tense and exciting. More than 2,000 spectators in the gymnasium created an unprecedentedly enthusiastic atmosphere. After the competition, Ms. Wang Yi presented the awards, and this year's Table Tennis League came to a close. The results of the two teams last night are listed below:

[Jingwu Red] [Huamei] Score

(1) Wang Youxin - Chuan Qifang 21-18

(2) Zhang Fuwei - Li Zongpei 12-21

(3) Ouyang Wei - Xue Xuchu 21-18

(4) Wang Youxin - Li Zongpei 21-16

(7) Wang Youxin - Xue Xuchu 22-20

(8) Zhang Fuzhang - Fu Qifang 25-23

(9) Ouyang Wei - Li Zongpei 21-23

Table Tennis Committee Chairman Wang Yi delivered a speech, and General Secretary Chen Linsheng reported. Then, photos were taken and the competition began. All-China champion Wang Youxin flew from Taiwan to cheer for Jingwu, and won all three games last night. However, Xue Xuchu's defeat to Ouyang Wei in the third game and Fu Qifang's defeat to Zhang Fuwei in the eighth game were fatal blows to Huamei last night. Otherwise, the score would have been tied at 4 each, and the ninth game would have been the decider, making it impossible to say who would have won the championship.

### Disposition Circumstances Ruling Execution

The disposition circumstances of the above three numbers have been executed separately by the Gold Control Bureau in accordance with the supervisory responsibility ruling. Among them, the disposition circumstances of commercial firms and villages have been ordered by the Gold Control Bureau to be followed and complied with. The remaining parts of the Soviet Jiangsu Farmers Bank and County Bank were sent by the bureau to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Department of Finance for review and execution. The entire process of discussing the illegal firms and villages was also reported to the Ministry of Finance for filing by the bureau. Regarding firms and villages in other regions and other financial institutions, because they have never been strictly inspected in the past, they have developed a bad style. The Gold Control Bureau, in the face of this real situation, has handled the disposition with leniency this time. For the four places of Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou and Zhenjiang, and other places where the firms and villages have not been inspected, they should be made to be vigilant and check themselves. The bureau is still prepared to send personnel to inspect the business of the villages around Shanghai at any time, hoping to bring them into line.

### Before the Salary Adjustment Order is Received; Municipal Government Employees Allowed to Borrow Money First

According to Tian Yongqian, Director of the Finance Bureau, the municipal government has not yet received a formal order from the central government regarding the 1.5-fold increase in salaries for public education personnel. At present, in order to take into account the difficult living conditions of municipal government employees, efforts are being made to raise funds to lend living expenses first. The amount will depend on the fund-raising situation. Since the salary adjustment of public education personnel, the municipal finance has been unable to balance income and expenditure. In addition to making every effort to rectify the source of taxation, each taxation office has been ordered to actively collect business tax.

### New Prices Approved for Eight Public Utilities; Not Calculated Based on New Coal Prices

[Our Newspaper's Report] The new prices for the eight public utility categories of water, electricity, gas, telephone, public buses, trams, ferries, and small railways in this city were meticulously calculated by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau after inviting representatives from each company to discuss the actual costs of each company. They were presented to the mayor, who sent people to Beijing, and have now been approved by the central competent authorities for implementation. It is reported that after the new prices were submitted to Beijing, the price of coal per catty increased slightly, but the authorities did not recalculate the prices based on the new coal prices, and approved them according to the originally approved figures.

### The Second Home for Female Workers; YMCA Female Workers' Night School; Free Supply of Spiritual and Material Food; Teachers and Students Have Harmonious Feelings and are as Close as Family

[Our Newspaper Special] The flowers in the warm room, the darlings in the palace, when they are in the magnificent and Westernized school gate, they would never dream of a group of laborers being excluded from the school gate. In order to study, they are willing to cheer up after 12 hours of tiring work and go to the labor night school to attend classes.

The Chinese Christian Young Women's Association established six night schools for female workers in this city to meet the intellectual worries of laborers. Three are located in Huxi, located around Caojiadu and Xiaoshadu Road, and three are located in Huxi, located around Yangshupu, all of which are densely populated factory areas, providing female workers with spiritual food for free, and have long become the second home for female workers!

The female workers' night school has been established for more than 20 years. It is designed specifically for female workers, and everything is for female workers. The class time is from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm every night, which does not conflict with their work, and the time can be flexible. If any of the students are assigned to work the night shift, the teacher will make up the class for them the next morning, so that their grades will not fall behind. And those female workers are all diligent and good students. After working hard all night, they do not eat or sleep, and are willing to drag their tired bodies and gather their spirits to go to their own school to attend classes the next morning. The female workers who study in the night school are models of students. They are never late, never leave early, never miss class easily, and are disciplined and polite.

Teaching Materials are Practical and Useful

The female workers' night school provides adult education, which can also be said to be literacy education. It is practical and useful. Under the premise of "learning for application," the teaching materials are compiled by the National Association of the Young Women's Association. The female workers' night school is divided into three classes: elementary, intermediate, and advanced. Each level studies for two terms and graduates in three years. Teaching is mainly in Mandarin. The most troublesome tortoise-rabbit race word problems in elementary school teaching materials have long been eliminated, and replaced by elementary abacus calculation, which is undoubtedly much more practical for female workers. Female workers who graduate from night school often have a Chinese language level that exceeds that of elementary school graduates. They can continue to subscribe, read simple books, and write ordinary letters.

Expenses are Donated

In addition, the most prominent feature of the labor night school is the harmonious relationship between teachers and students. It is not only a school, but also a family. Teachers are like parents, teaching students to read and solving their personal problems for them. Occasionally, if a student is absent from class, the teacher will definitely visit them to see if they are sick or if an accident has happened. It is truly a case of teachers and students becoming one, and students love this night school as much as everyone loves their own home. The expenses of the female workers' night school are taken from the Young Women's Association, and the Young Women's Association's expenses are donated by the society. Therefore, the female workers' department is always the first to respond enthusiastically when the Young Women's Association holds a fundraising conference every year. Moreover, at the end of the fundraising, the group awards of all previous sessions belong to the female workers' department. During the fundraising period, they are so excited that they cannot sleep and run around all day. The precious achievements are accumulated from pennies and nickels of hard-earned money.

Looking Forward to Social Assistance

Currently, there are more than 900 female workers studying at the female workers' night school, which has already reached the saturation point that the six schools can accommodate. However, at the beginning of each semester, there are always a large number of new students requesting admission. This shows that life has deprived them of their right to study, and work has taken up their time to study. Although only two hours are left, their desire to learn to read is still very high. However, the Young Women's Association, due to the limitation of enrollment, finally has to heartbrokenly watch them leave in disappointment.

The Young Women's Association has been hoping to expand the female workers' night school for several years, but it has not been able to fulfill its wish due to limited funding. This time, the 40th fundraising conference of the Young Women's Association has already opened. They hope that this year's fundraising can have unexpected gains, so that the Labor Department plans to open another female workers' night school to benefit the female workers. This is practical work to eliminate illiteracy and is the most meaningful charity. May people of insight help!

The Dyeing and Weaving Industry Continues to Handle Distribution; Special Allocation to Stores, Quoted and Approved Allocation

The cotton cloth produced by the machine dyeing and weaving industry in this city, during the price-limited period, in addition to being sold by each factory on its own and reporting to the association for record, the cloth woven from the allocated cotton yarn will be submitted to the association for joint distribution in order to show fairness. A total of four phases of allocation have been received and distributed to the members of the cotton cloth, sewing, hardware decoration, and embroidery industries. Later, the price limit was canceled, the yarn allocation was stopped, and it came to a temporary end. This method has been praised by the authorities, who believe that in the current situation where the source of goods for retailers is not smooth, it is necessary for other industries to start implementing it, and they have been instructed separately to expedite matters. After receiving this instruction from the authorities, the Dyeing and Weaving Association convened the distribution committee yesterday. After detailed discussions, it was decided to continue the joint distribution, and it was agreed that retailers should be given priority in the allocation in order to supply the market and restore the city's appearance. As for the distribution method, it is intended to refer to the quotation and approval method set by the Textile Building Company in order to help suppress cloth prices. It is reported that the industry association has submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for filing and is actively preparing for implementation.

### General Commodity Prices: Market Activity Extremely Low, Commodity Prices Rise in a Straight Line

Since the promulgation and implementation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs, which included price controls for over two months, ultimately, due to improper implementation and lack of coordination, a buying spree has been created, pervading the entire country, with goods hidden and nine out of ten stores empty. Under this severe atmosphere, the authorities had no choice but to stipulate supplementary measures. The main points of the supplementary measures are as follows:

(1) Grain is to be traded easily at market prices, with free transportation and sales. (2) Cotton cloth, sugar, coal, and salt will have their prices set by the central authorities, based on cost, for overall regulation. Other important goods, including daily necessities and industrial raw materials, will be managed by local governments, authorized to refer to supply conditions and follow the principle of cost-based pricing. (3) Public utilities and transportation enterprises should calculate costs, and the competent authorities should approve and adjust prices. (4) Salaries of civil and military officials and teachers should be adjusted appropriately, considering the necessities of life. (5) Wages should be adjusted appropriately, considering the needs to maintain workers' livelihoods. (6) Regarding commodity taxes and other ad valorem taxes, collection should be adjusted based on commodity prices, in accordance with tax laws. From the promulgation of the new economic plan to the announcement of the supplementary measures on November 1st, it took exactly seventy days. We believe that: (1) The price control policy has, in fact, been completely abandoned. (2) The effectiveness of currency reform has also been mostly destroyed. (3) In economic terms, it is a 180-degree turn, with everything almost reverting to the original state of the legal tender era. (4) Merchants who sold goods according to price controls, as well as law-abiding citizens who exchanged gold certificates, have suddenly suffered a great loss. (5) The future economic situation will become even more difficult, and we do not know how the authorities will manage the aftermath or how they will appease the majority of good people who have suffered losses.

Last week, transportation businesses nationwide, under the restraints of price controls for the past two months, adjusted their new prices one after another. (1) Starting from the 5th, passenger and freight rates on ships increased uniformly by four times, while those calculated in Taiwan currency increased by 120 percent. (2) Starting from the 7th, railway passenger fares increased fivefold, and freight rates increased by onefold. (3) The price of domestic regular letters is proposed to increase to ten cents per piece, and telegrams to four cents per word, to be implemented after completing the legislative process. (4) Public utility prices in this city are about to be adjusted, including water, electricity, gas, telephone, and other items, with some saying that an additional charge will be added starting from the 1st. Last week, the trend of market commodity prices, due to the lifting of price controls, was as if they had been liberated. At the beginning of the week, due to being caught off guard and negotiating pricing, very little business was conducted. Later on, chaotic bidding occurred, with prices rising madly in a straight line. First, let's talk about cotton cloth. Because supplementary measures stipulated that the central government must set the price based on cost, there was only off-market bidding in this city before the central government's approval. Long-absent 40-count Blue Phoenix brand cotton yarn was first bid at 3,900 yuan on Tuesday. After that, it soared all the way, once breaking the 10,000 yuan mark on Friday, settling at 9,500 yuan. By the weekend, it created a high price of 12,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse yarn rose from 2,200 yuan on Tuesday to close at 7,300 yuan at the weekend. Dragon Head shirting was bid at 90 yuan on Tuesday, rising continuously. In one day on Friday, it jumped from 180 yuan to 250 yuan, and at the weekend it continued to climb to a peak of 310 yuan.

At the opening of the grain market on Monday, the negotiated price for top-quality white rice was 80 yuan, but because production costs had risen sharply, the negotiated price could not take effect. By the weekend, the market was tending to stall again, with black market prices soaring.

The rise in coarse grains was rampant. Edible oil and flour were not transacted, but off-market bidding rose relentlessly. On Friday, soybean oil was bid at 550 yuan, and vegetable oil at 500 yuan. In the flour market on Wednesday, miscellaneous brand flour was bid at 31 yuan, and on the weekend, "Warship" brand flour was bid at 73 yuan. Daily necessities such as cigarettes, soap, and matches were all rising continuously at high peaks, with no signs of stopping. In short, the surge in market commodity prices last week was so fierce that even the legal tender era could not match it. After some commodities were opened for negotiated pricing, they were immediately renegotiated, as if in a major reaction to the high pressure of price controls for the past two months. Regarding the amount of Gold Yuan Notes issued, according to the third inspection announcement by the Gold Yuan Note Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee, as of October 31st, a total of 1,595,386,691.00 yuan of Gold Yuan Notes had been issued. This was an increase of 638,634,196.60 yuan from the issuance amount of 956,752,494.40 yuan at the end of September, an increase of approximately 67 percent. With such a sharp increase in the issuance of Gold Yuan Notes and commodity prices soaring relentlessly, it is becoming increasingly difficult to balance government revenue and expenditure, and we are indeed being forced back onto the old path of vicious inflation.

### Currency and Finance: Northern Capital Flows South, Money Market Gradually Strengthens, Public Sentiment Revived, Interest Rates Rise Quietly

Last week, the money market in this city still exhibited a very tight situation in the first half of the week. Starting on Monday, the authorities decided to abolish price controls and instead use negotiated pricing. This was tantamount to giving a stimulant to the long-fatigued public sentiment. Everyone in the market felt that commodity prices could rise sharply from now on. As a result, deposits in banks were withdrawn entirely, causing an unprecedented shortage of orders in the industry. In desperation, banks had no choice but to cope with this panic by borrowing money from outside the industry or using cash for compensation. However, the people outside the industry also showed no weakness. Despite the tight money market and commodity prices jumping several times, the trend of rushing to buy goods in the market was still extremely popular. This benefited the owners of capital, and interest rates rose to one high point after another. On Thursday, the money market interest rate reached as high as ninety cents, and ordinary interest rates were also bid at over sixty cents, which was truly an irresistible blow to the banking industry. Although bank interest rates, from Tuesday onwards, had been adjusted several times at the request of the industry, to six percent for deposit interest and one cent for loan interest, and one cent and five points for interbank lending, they were still far behind the high interest rates. With banks reporting shortages of funds one after another, they had become mere transfer agencies for customers. Last week, there were rumors that some banks were unstable. Although it was later proven that nothing went wrong, the precarious situation of the banking industry can be imagined. By the second half of the week, the situation in the financial world was completely different. This was to be expected. With the Northeast fallen and North China already suffering an unprecedentedly severe threat, capital, known for its sensitivity, flowed south in torrents, seeking its refuge. This temporarily eased the tight money situation in this city. The shortage of orders in the industry generally improved, and the amount of bounced checks decreased from Thursday onwards, and cash reserves were no longer as tight as in the past. Last week, interest rates repeatedly reached high peaks. On Monday, ordinary interest was charged at four cents, and by Wednesday, interbank interest rates of five cents and four points were commonly seen, with the highest even reaching beyond six cents. The money market interest rate was forty-eight cents on Tuesday, but on Thursday it rose to ninety cents. Although Northern funds arrived on Friday, the money market interest rate still stood at seventy-five cents, and other interest rates were also around sixty cents.

The exchange situation of national banks and bureaus had a surplus in the first half of the week due to tax revenues and other income, which naturally exacerbated the tight money situation. In the second half of the week, the banks and bureaus went from surplus to deficit, with even a deficit of several million yuan on Thursday. It is said that the authorities are considering resuming the publication of the exchange deficit of national banks and bureaus. It is remembered that during the price control period, the authorities prohibited national banks and bureaus from publishing the exchange deficit, presumably to avoid stimulating the bullish sentiment with the large deficit figures. Now, if they resume publishing the deficit figures, it may be to give a counter-stimulus to the bullish sentiment with the large surplus figures from the sale of goods. If so, then in the near future, national banks and bureaus may have continuous large surpluses.

Last week, the interbank exchange rate remained at the maximum price control rate of 24/1000. In addition to the fact that the actual exchange rate differed greatly from the price control rate, the interbank exchange rate of national banks and bureaus was also brewing for adjustment last week.

Regarding foreign exchange rates, the authorities have repeatedly denied any talk of liberalization. It is said that export businesses are being supported by export loans. As for how to increase remittances from overseas Chinese, there are no specific measures to be found. The Hong Kong foreign exchange market showed little fluctuation. Gold was at HK$305.5 per tael on Monday, HK$306 on Tuesday, and then rose by another half yuan on Thursday. The market price of US dollars was 5.26 yuan on Monday, once fell to 5.24 yuan on Tuesday, and then rebounded to 5.26 yuan on Thursday.

### Xiong Shihui in Nanchang: Talks About the War Situation and Jiangxi's Condition, Predicts That by the End of the Year or Next Spring, the World Will Have a Startling Event

— Our Reporter Liu Zao

[Our Nanchang Telegram, 5th] Mr. Xiong Shihui recently returned to Jiangxi from Nanjing. When passing through Jiujiang, he stayed briefly at Guling. After arriving in Nanchang, he attended the tea party of the Provincial Assembly and the expanded commemorative week of various circles in the provincial capital. He also attended a reception held by the Provincial Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, which was in the midst of a dispute over the re-election of the chairman. At each gathering, Xiong emphasized that the current situation of the National Army is not as pessimistic as the general pessimists believe. He also believes that by the end of this year, or at the latest next spring, even more startling events will occur in the world. At that time, China's situation will naturally change from independently supporting itself and fighting against the communist army to becoming a main force in the world's upholding of justice and war.

A Military Man's View

He said: Recently, the National Army's abandonment of Changchun, the loss of Jinan, and the successive retreats of Zhengzhou and Kaifeng have made everyone believe that the Communist bandits are gradually approaching success and that the military discipline of the National Army is greatly deteriorated and morale is low. In fact, this is not the case. In the current military situation, Changchun and Jinan have long become isolated islands. As long as the bandit army is willing to fight to the death at the cost of sacrifice, we can abandon them after obtaining a considerable price.

The retreats of Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, from a military man's point of view, are not at all surprising in military significance. Because in the past, our failures were due to military affairs being constrained by politics. For example, the last time Kaifeng fell, the National Representatives, Supervisory Committee members, and local figures in Henan all petitioned the central government for reinforcements. As a result, the National Army, in order to take care of political public opinion, caused the strategic situation to become passive, stationing troops everywhere, being weak everywhere, and being beaten everywhere, just like Jesus being nailed to the cross, unable to move his hands and feet.

Actively Seizing Opportunities

Now, our strategy has changed. Although we have withdrawn from Kaifeng and other places, we can mobilize troops flexibly, increase our combat power, and adapt to our strategic needs. We can actively seize opportunities to annihilate the bandit army. Xiong also made a summary comparison of the strength of the National Army and the Communist army to illustrate the future of the war and the final victory. He said: Looking at the entire military strength of the bandit and our land, sea, and air forces, there is no doubt that the National Army has an absolute advantage. Specifically, in terms of the army alone, the bandit and our military strength in the Northeast is comparable, the National Army has an advantage in North China, and it goes without saying in Central and South China. In the past, the National Army was deploying troops everywhere and being passive everywhere. Now, this rigid strategy has been completely corrected. Xiong further cited the President's public announcement in the central government to predict the future of the war, believing that the communist bloc cannot lead the world, and the Chinese Communist Party is a tail of the communist bloc, and of course, it is even more impossible to succeed in China.

Establishing a Pacification and Construction Base

Speaking of the situation in Jiangxi, Xiong emphasized the personality, experience, and knowledge of Chairman Hu Jiafeng, believing that Jiangxi can be made a base for suppressing the rebellion and a vanguard for national construction. However, he believes that the prevailing clan fights and factional struggles in various counties of Jiangxi are hindering Jiangxi's progress and harming the people.

He said: Now, the general public in Jiangxi, when thinking of the communist army's claim to cross the river, is holding unnecessary excessive panic. This is a wrong mentality. From the perspective of military deployment, he further explained that the current defense of Jiangxi is prepared for any eventuality. Because there is the Quzhou Pacification Headquarters in the east, the Changsha Pacification Headquarters in the west, the Central China剿總 in the north, and the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters in the south. The provincial territory is surrounded by careful military deployments. As long as we work hard to organize and train the masses, strengthen the day-to-day defense forces, and refine the teams, so that the invisible bandits cannot hide and the tangible bandits cannot enter, we have fulfilled our security responsibilities and should also fulfill our national obligation to suppress the rebellion. For example, if the country needs soldiers, we will send troops if we have them. If the country needs grain, we should send grain if we have it. We hope that the bandit disaster will not repeat itself in Jiangxi, so we should send troops, send grain, and fulfill the local responsibility to suppress the rebellion. We should also put out the clan fights and factional struggles in various counties, everything for the people, everything for pacification and construction. In the future, Jiangxi can become a base for suppressing the rebellion and a vanguard for national construction.

### The Case of the Woman from Huangdu Township Being Raped to Death: The Question of the Culprit Has Not Yet Been Clarified

[Our Qingpu Telegram, 6th] The case of Shen Pang Guiying, a woman from Huangdu Township, being illegally detained by the former Qinglong District Office and raped to death on July 17, has been more than three months. The County Judicial Office has conducted four investigative hearings, but the identity of the culprit has not yet been clarified. It is now heard that the defendant, District Chief Xu Jiwu, etc., believe that the cause of death of "suicide by hanging out of shame after being raped" as identified by Su High Court forensic doctor Xuan Fang in the previous exhumation and examination of Shen's remains is unscientific and difficult to accept. If the Judicial Office determines that they are guilty of rape, they will jointly file a complaint with the High Court against Xuan Fang and request that another forensic doctor be sent to examine the body again. The current Judicial Office has been ordered to be upgraded to a District Court, and the new President Wang Shichun has arrived in Qingpu. After its establishment next month, it will be tried by the District Procuratorate.

### Starting from "Boiled Ice Cream"

— Suo Jian

This summer, many people cannot afford ice cream, so they buy ice cream powder. But after buying the powder, they cannot make ice cream, so they have to mix it with boiling water and taste the hot "boiled ice cream." Yet no one complains that this "boiled ice cream" is not cold, and everyone praises it, saying that "the taste is delicious and the quality is good." Now, many people cannot afford milk, so they comfort themselves by saying, "Ice cream powder can replace milk, it tastes better than milk, and it doesn't cost sugar." Many mothers of infants, because fish and meat are expensive and milk is becoming increasingly scarce, are also vying to use ice cream powder as a substitute for milk powder to feed their babies. Without discussing the composition of ice cream powder, it is certainly insufficient to replace milk powder, but it can at least barely satisfy the infants' hunger, because ice cream powder was initially quite cheap, and the parents in the salaried class could barely afford it.

However, the government never makes overall arrangements to distribute these long-accumulated, cheaply "conceded" materials from friendly countries to benefit the salaried class, but instead allows them to flow continuously into the hands of the "cattle party," with most of them scattered on both sides of the road, raising prices every day and making high profits. It was not until the buying spree broke out and the "salaried class" was on the verge of death that the government remembered the few remaining leftover materials, saying that it would implement rationing. Although there is not much left, and half of it is moldy, it can at least save the urgent needs of some teachers and civil servants. As a result, many people took their ration purchase certificates and were overjoyed. No one investigated the government's past "crimes" of continuously allowing smuggling, waste, and mold. The leniency and forgiveness of teachers, civil servants, and the general salaried class in our country towards the authorities is truly unparalleled!

Who knew that after the price controls were lifted, commodity prices jumped seven or eight levels in a row, and many prices were successively "ordered" to be adjusted, while the treatment of teachers and civil servants was still under discussion for improvement, with permission to increase by one and a half times. By the time they receive the new treatment, it will be late November or early December. Just at this moment, the Materials Supply Bureau announced a few days ago that it would close its doors and raise prices, depriving the teachers and civil servants of their only meager "cheapness"! In all countries of the world, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, the harsh treatment and abuse of teachers, civil servants, and the salaried class is probably unparalleled! In the world, the injustice of things and the unreasonableness of reason probably reach their peak with this measure of the Materials Supply Bureau!

Government! I want to ask you: Leftover materials can be allowed to rot, and can also be allowed to benefit the scalpers, is it really impossible to sell them cheaply to the teachers and civil servants who are on the verge of death and whose families are hungry?

### Hypnotic Anesthesia

— Mao Yi

Due to the lack of anesthetics, it forced doctors San Biman and Wu Qulefu of a prisoner of war hospital near Singapore to try to replace anesthetics with hypnotism. They decided to first select dental and surgical conditions to try hypnotism.

When performing hypnotism, the patient is asked to lie supine on the chair. The method adopted is a "concentration fatigue method", asking the patient to stare fixedly at the tip of a pencil, the distance between the pencil and the eye is extremely close, so close that if it goes a little further, it will appear blurry. This method was first created by Dr. James Braid around 1840, and he called this method hypnotism. His main purpose was to put the patient into a "state of suggestion" in order to treat various diseases.

Among the patients of San Biman and Wu Qulefu, twenty-three people had their teeth extracted. Other cases included nail removal and incision and drainage of suppurating wounds.

It is important for the hypnotist to verbally assure the patient during hypnosis that they will not feel pain during and after the surgery, and that they will not remember the surgery afterwards. If the patient feels pain after the surgery, it is either because the hypnotist neglected appropriate suggestions, or because the patient was awakened too quickly after the first suggestion was made (i.e. less than ten minutes).

In the mid-seventeenth century, someone tied the feet of a chicken, placed it on the ground, and after it stopped struggling, drew a straight line in front of it with chalk, which could hypnotize it and keep it still. However, the general public still does not trust this operation very much. One scholar was even forced to resign from his position as a medical lecturer at the University of London in 1838 due to practical hypnotism.

The success of the two doctors Shan and Wu overturned past prejudices. Now is the time to thoroughly review the relationship between hypnotism and suggestion to surgical medical skills.

### Remembering Mr. Liang Juchuan

— Qinghua

In the midst of a scene of panic buying, queuing, and confusion, I don't know why, it reminded me of this old gentleman who has been dead for more than thirty years. He was Liang Ji (Juchuan) of Guilin, Liang Shuming's father, who drowned himself in Jishuitan, Beijing, in the morning of the seventh day of the tenth lunar month in 1918 (the seventh year of the Republic of China).

His death is vaguely said by general compilers of modern history to be martyrdom to the Qing Dynasty, which seems somewhat out of context, without the patience to study his lengthy multiple letters of more than sixty pages. His death once again became a major debate between the shocks of the new and old literary circles. Speaking calmly from our current perspective, his death seems to be the most loyal and even the most extreme expression of loyalty to democracy in the Republic of China. For example, he saw the rise of the Republic of China, the collapse of old morality, and the new morality Zhu invented. "High-ranking officials and contemporary talents advocated gambling, prostitution, and all kinds of ridiculous pleasures, which became popular for a while and spread to each other." "Reforming bureaucrats missed the best opportunity. ... Each department was reorganized, not first taking character and integrity as the standard, but still being warm and affectionate, only calculating to place private individuals." The earliest original order of not calculating the position and generally paying a living allowance of sixty yuan was later repeatedly improved, forming a source of profit. This place made him hate Yuan Shikai and Zhao Bingjun, the premier of the cabinet, the general of Yuan's staff, known as "Zhian." (Zhao was also a key figure in the assassination of Song Jiaoren, and it was later rumored that Xiangcheng poisoned him.) Mr. Liang was a good civil servant who valued tranquility and obeyed the law. He also served as an official of the Republic of China, but he still adhered to the old rules of the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods of the late Qing Dynasty. Except for not seeing superiors privately in the office, he never solicited Zhao, and he still published an old letter to Zhao Bingjun, hoping that he would realize his mistake, before his death. Although it was somewhat close to "seeking skin from a tiger," the cover of the will stated that people should call the authorities to let them know: "Yun Juchuan left a public letter and died."

When he decided to die as a martyr, "knowing that the general trend is difficult to save, and donating this small amount to preserve a line of national character," he was still very yearning for the parliament of the early Republic of China, and asked his children several times when the parliament would open. "Unexpectedly, after the parliament opened in the year of the癸丑(1913), the general parliamentarians were all not the parliamentarians that they had hoped for in their hearts, and they were not at all concerned with saving the people and the country, making trouble and doing things for themselves, and not succeeding in anything." This cut off his idea of ​​going to the parliament in person to "earnestly state the people's livelihood and national plan." His suicide was precisely to shock and revitalize, and never to seek fame and praise for himself. He once said with emotion: I am so old, even if I live for another twenty years, I will only listen to operas and eat at restaurants every day. Although I do not compete with the world, what good is it for the country? It turns out that this old gentleman was still one of the people who promoted new dramas in the late Qing Dynasty, and had compiled the script for the drama "Women Love the Country", which was performed in the capital in the year of Bingwu (1906) of Guangxu. It was based on the story of the daughter of Lu Qishi worrying about Lu. He usually believed that "gathering thousands of people to give orders in person is no more than a drama theater," so he paid great attention to its profound educational nature.

This old gentleman was a decisive, intelligent, meticulous, thoughtful, and observant person. The entire will, with closely spaced words and detailed notes, hooks, strokes, circles, and dots, can truly be said to be full of repeated reminders, lingering and sad. What is especially admirable is that he wrote these texts for a period of about five or six years. Whenever he had free time, he would close the door and write quickly. If something suddenly interrupted him (once it was a meeting of the electric light company), he would also explain it on the paper and continue writing when he had time. He often locked it in a drawer and kept it secret, not letting anyone know. According to his own record, "癸丑甲寅 second daughter Shi Lu prevented the investigation," and after several years, he was still able to fulfill his long-cherished wish, and he truly died peacefully!

His will has a photo-written version. In 1940, when I first met Liang Shuming in Hong Kong, I asked if this book could be reprinted, and Shuming looked sad. I dare to say that this book is very rare outside. The ancients said that when you hear the drums, you think of generals. We, however, suddenly mention Mr. Juchuan during this bitter period of restlessness, naturally cherishing his uncompromising attitude towards life. Xian Si

### Odds and Ends

The general commodity prices in the United States now average 69% higher than before the war (1939); prices in Iceland are 207% higher than before the war; Mexico is 205% higher; Czechoslovakia is 178% higher; and Newfoundland is 72% higher.

Among the surplus materials of the US Navy, there is a type of seawater (seawater) soap, which no one asked about and was left for a long time. Later, it was all bought by a company in Gaza, and it is said that it is very useful for washing camels with many fleas using Da Zhong soap.

### Grasping Life

— Song Xian

Professor Osigin of Columbia University once published an article describing how a disabled student, Regina Pike, faced death and completed his studies.

Pike was unfortunately born with progressive paralysis. The symptoms of paralysis were gradually progressing in his body. He sat in a wheelchair because his legs could no longer move.

Doctors told Pike that his only hands could remain healthy for two years, and when the symptoms of paralysis progressed to the heart, there would be no cure. Pike remained energetic and maintained an optimistic attitude. He decided to make good use of these short two years of life; friends raised money for him to attend school.

Within two years, his grades were outstanding and he was praised as the best student in the entire school, but he never mentioned that he had an incurable disease.

Professor Osigin once asked him: "Why are you only preparing for two years? What do you plan to do after two years?"

He smiled and said, "I will be dead after two years."

Pike's spirit is admirable. After his death, his face still shone with the glory of victory. He had used his only two years of life to meet the approaching grim reaper with calm courage day by day.
