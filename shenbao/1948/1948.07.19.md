### Reaction of Political Circles in Beijing to the Saying That the CCP Will Split

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] Political figures in the capital have the following reactions to the views reported by the Associated Press that some officials in North China believe that the CCP is about to split: (1) They believe that the government's policy of adhering to suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion will not change. (2) The CCP Central Committee resolved on the 10th of this month to agree with the resolution of the Communist International Intelligence Bureau condemning the Yugoslav Communist Party and began a new cleansing movement to review and liquidate nationalists within the Communist Party. Within the CCP, there is no shortage of people who have been influenced by the Yugoslav Communists' separation from the Communist International and their inclination towards nationalism, but there is no force to split the bandit party. (3) The CCP's response to the resolution of the Communist International is the final proof of the party's international espionage nature. People who have been deceived and made mistakes in the past, if they return to the embrace of the motherland and strive to save the country and build the nation, will naturally be welcomed by the government. (4) Since the constitution has been promulgated, the so-called "coalition government" is an act of opposing the constitution and disrupting constitutional government. In a constitutional government, no one can consider it.

Editorial

### Large Denomination Banknotes Have Indeed Been Issued

Although the relevant authorities have repeatedly denied the rumors of issuing large denomination banknotes, dismissing them as purely rumors, most people are unwilling to believe them deeply. This newspaper also published an article on the 15th, elaborating on the current situation and predicting that it would be realized in a short period of time. This is not because everyone has foresight and is able to speak accurately; nor is it because we have obtained any secret information and know in advance that this would happen. In fact, before each previous issuance of large denomination banknotes, similar routine articles were invariably published, and the result was that the stronger the denial, the closer it was to the truth. Therefore, everyone has long tacitly understood this type of denial statement and made a reverse inference.

Now, the issuance of large denomination banknotes has indeed been formally announced yesterday. The denominations are Customs Gold Units of 10,000, 25,000, 50,000, and 250,000, which are equivalent to legal tender of 200,000, 500,000, 1,000,000, and 5,000,000. The term "large denomination" can be said to be worthy of its name. At a time when cash is extremely scarce and credit is tight, these types of large denomination banknotes may indeed be needed. However, if the country's issuance policy continues along this path and refuses to make a decisive change, then as a result of the rising prices, there will still be a "need to issue banknotes of larger denominations to redeem the current banknotes." Before long, today's large denomination banknotes will probably become small denomination banknotes again. Therefore, we hope that the few promises made by Central Bank President Yu, who said that "the government has certain (measures) (for) reducing currency in circulation and stabilizing prices," are not just empty official rhetoric, but can be quickly realized.

When the Legislative Yuan discussed the general budget bill on July 2, the government authorities also formally stated that the total state budget for the second half of the 37th year, including the ordinary budget expenditure of more than 3,200 trillion yuan and the special budget expenditure of more than 5,900 trillion yuan. Ordinary expenditures will be offset by tax revenues and there will be a surplus, while special budgets will be offset by the sale of state-owned property and other means, and no additional currency will be issued in the second half of the year. In addition, legislators have also made important proposals to freeze the issuance of a balanced budget. Therefore, we also firmly believe that the large denomination banknotes issued this time should not be specifically for making up for deficits, but for the purpose of redeeming the current banknotes. As President Yu said, "The issuance of banknotes with larger denominations this time... only increases the face value of the banknotes and does not increase the amount of issuance." However, how exactly will the current small denomination banknotes be redeemed and destroyed? We hope that the authorities should have a definite plan and statement.

As for whether the issuance of large denomination banknotes will affect prices, it should be judged by whether or not the amount of issuance is indeed not increased. If, on the one hand, large denomination banknotes are issued in large quantities, and on the other hand, small denomination banknotes are not withdrawn, or small denomination banknotes of equal value are not withdrawn; then, judging from the quantity theory of money, the responsibility for affecting prices should not be entirely placed on the shoulders of "speculators." Even if they are accused of "disrupting the financial market" and "investigated according to law," I am afraid that the currency will still not be contracted and prices will not be stabilized. President Yu has served as Minister of Finance for a long time and has a deep understanding of the relationship between currency and prices. He should know that these words of ours are definitely not intentionally spoken on behalf of "speculators."

The foundation of a nation lies in credit. Confucius said, "A people without trust cannot stand," and also said, "If a person is not trustworthy, I do not know what he can do." On the one hand, denials are made with certainty, and the ink is not yet dry, and on the other hand, large denomination banknotes of 1 million and 5 million are suddenly issued. Although it is said that there is no deceit in war, and that in this period of military suppression of disorder, it may be appropriate to use tactics and quickly achieve success; but in the perception of the people, there are indeed regrets. In the future, if we encounter the same request from "responsible persons of the chamber of commerce and the banking industry that there is a need to issue banknotes of larger denominations to redeem the current banknotes," we believe that being open and honest with the public may also be a path of democratic politics.

President Yu also said in a written statement: "Recently, there has been a shortage of banknotes in various places, and industry and commerce are deeply troubled by the difficulty of turnover." This is indeed the current reality and a legitimate reason for issuing large denomination banknotes. However, finance values nature, and commerce values stability. Whether it is for issuing large denomination banknotes or for suppressing prices, all artificial means that suddenly contract or release, bordering on disrupting the market, should be avoided as much as possible in order to achieve the goal of "benefiting the people." Even if the political skills are very clever, after repeated performances, when the general public, based on past experience, is completely aware of the truth, their effectiveness may be limited.

### Britain is Building Roads on the Border of Kang and Tibet, Started in Early Spring of Last Year, and Erecting Boundary Markers and Building Houses in the Kang Territory

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 17th] Since this newspaper first published the news that Britain is building a highway on the border of Kang and Tibet, it has aroused close attention from the world. According to reliable reports from the Kangbao Security Command, in mid-April of the 35th year, more than a hundred people of mixed ethnicity, including Zayu, Langhuang, and savages, carried road-building equipment to the Deranma area on the border between Tibet and India, and proceeded toward Zayu. They were transporting it to Walong to build roads. At that time, Daran, from the top to Tangrongna (that is, the meaning of mountain), had been built, but the section from Tangrongna to Walong had not yet been built, and the section from Walong to Zayu was being built at an accelerated pace. It was also mentioned that a certain party had advanced to the border of Kemai County in Chayu line in January of the 35th year, erected boundary markers and built houses. Judging from their intentions, it seemed that they intended to use Chayu as a base to open up lines eastward to Yunnan, north into Xikang, and west through the Tibetan border to reach India. The difficulty felt by the local authorities is that the area west of the Jinsha River is the sphere of influence of the Tibetan side, and it is not easy to go deep into it. According to a report from the Yunnan Provincial Government, the two administrative bureaus of Deqin and Lijiang on the Yunnan-Kang border will be changed to counties for the purpose of prevention. The Pacification Headquarters has forwarded this to the Central Government for approval.

### South Korean Police Harass Overseas Chinese Merchants; Improvements Made After Our Negotiations; Searches of Stores Require Contact with Consulate

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 18th] Overseas Chinese merchants in various parts of South Korea are finding it difficult to maintain their businesses, or are even being forced to close down, due to extortion by South Korean police and local gangsters. After repeated negotiations by the Chinese Consulate General in Seoul with the US military government, the situation has improved slightly. In Seoul, for example, as many as thirteen local police agencies had the authority to search Chinese-owned stores in the past. In addition, there were six agencies, including the Central Price Control Bureau and the Police Department's Investigation Bureau. The so-called thirteen local police agencies, in addition to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, also included the twelve police stations under the jurisdiction of Gyeonggi Province, all of which had the authority to search stores at any time under the pretext of investigating black market transactions. Incidents of extortion and gangsters posing as police officers occurred frequently. After the consulate's negotiations, the search authority of these thirteen agencies has been unified. From now on, matters concerning the local police and overseas Chinese will be handled by the Metropolitan Police Agency (called the First Police Supervisory Office); at the same time, when officials from various police stations go to search Chinese-owned stores and residences, they must contact the consulate or be accompanied by consular staff. Night searches are also to be avoided as much as possible. As for the unification of the authority of the Police Department's Investigation Bureau, the central police agencies, and the six agencies of the Price Control Bureau, the consulate is currently negotiating with the US military government.

### Tax Rates and Sales Prices; Unreasonable Regulations

Overseas Chinese Merchants Find It Difficult to Survive

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 18th] Overseas Chinese merchants in South Korea are finding it difficult to survive, in addition to being extorted by unscrupulous elements in the South Korean police.

However, before the goods can be sold, the Price Control Bureau sets price limits, and violators are severely punished. The limited prices are almost half the black market prices. More than one hundred Chinese-owned trading companies in Seoul have requested the consulate to find ways to protect them. The consulate is currently negotiating with the US military government, hoping that it will either levy import taxes based on the limited prices or raise the limited prices to achieve a balance.

### Overseas Chinese in Various Parts of South Korea Form Autonomous Organizations

Eliminating Bad Elements Such as Opium, Gambling, etc.

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 17th] The more than 14,000 overseas Chinese in South Korea have implemented a "South Korean Overseas Chinese Autonomous Organization" similar to the Baojia system. It is likely that South Korea is the only place in the world where overseas Chinese have a sound autonomous organization. According to a reporter's investigation, there are currently 45 chambers of commerce in South Korea, as well as the Seoul General Chamber of Commerce. In areas with a chamber of commerce, there is also an overseas Chinese autonomous district office, as well as the Seoul General Office. This system was initiated by the Consul General in Seoul, Su Menggong, who also promoted it and took responsibility for guidance. It was implemented simultaneously in various parts of South Korea on June 15. The personnel of the autonomous district offices are generally elected autonomously by the overseas Chinese. The most important tasks of the district offices are to eliminate bad elements such as opium, gambling, and prostitution among the overseas Chinese, run adult literacy classes for overseas Chinese, assist overseas Chinese who have fled from North Korea to South Korea, report South Korean gangsters who impersonate overseas Chinese, copy domestic news broadcasts so that the general overseas Chinese population can understand the situation in their motherland, and register the movement of overseas Chinese in order to facilitate concentration in the event of an emergency. The organization of the various district offices has been approved by the South Korean authorities, and their connection with the consulate is even closer. According to Consul Su Menggong, more than 20 overseas Chinese involved in opium, gambling, and prostitution have been reported by overseas Chinese since this year before the establishment of the various district offices. After the consulate confirmed the reports, it forced them to return to their country.

### The Victory at Longshan is the Greatest Victory on the Shandong Battlefield; Celebration for Combat Heroes; Using Flesh and Blood and Courage to Earn the Most Honorable Symbol

[Our Jinan Air Dispatch] Due to the victory at Longshan, the Qian Baiying Brigade and Wang Jingzhen Brigade of the National Army's Cao Zhenduo Division defeated the Communist bandits' Bohai Column, achieving the greatest victory on the Shandong battlefield since the Changwei Campaign. In order to reward those with merit, the units recently held grand celebrations in the suburbs of Jinan. During the celebrations, each brigade selected the officers and soldiers with the most merit in this battle as "Combat Heroes" by company, with soldiers selecting themselves. Each brigade selected over seven hundred people, for a total of over one thousand four hundred people.

Our reporter was also invited to participate in the celebration. The venue for the celebration was on the square near the brigade headquarters. A mat shed was erected as a command platform, and at the very front of the platform was a pine and cypress decorated archway with the words "Combat Hero." This was the "Combat Hero Seat" for those who had contributed the most in this battle. To the left was a "List of Heroes" six to seven feet high and over thirty feet wide, filled with the names of each combat hero written in red ink. In addition, each hero wore a red cloth strip with the words "Combat Hero" on the left breast, which demonstrated the most honorable symbol earned with their flesh and blood and courage.

At the start of the ceremony, Commander Wang Yaowu personally distributed awards and merit certificates to each "Combat Hero," and used the most accessible language to encourage everyone to be a "Combat Hero" and "not to be a bad seed." Following this, Division Commander Cao encouraged everyone, stating that today each brigade only has over seven hundred combat heroes, and he hoped that everyone would become a combat hero in the future, that everyone would have merit, and that they would become a "Hero Brigade" and expand into a "Hero Division." Afterwards, Mr. Yao, an inspector from the Ministry of National Defense, said: "A soldier's career is on the battlefield, and achieving merit on the battlefield is the greatest glory for a soldier. Comrades who achieve merit are role models for all of our officers and soldiers. Everyone should achieve merit and do everything with merit to eliminate the bandits and defend the country."

Finally, after a representative of the combat heroes gave a response, the ceremony came to a close. After the ceremony, the reporter interviewed over a dozen combat heroes. One of them, named Guo Sheng, was a 20-year-old light machine gunner. In the battle to attack the Yujiazhuang north of Longshan, he was the first to carry a machine gun under the cover of artillery smoke bombs and rushed to the front of the Communist bandits' bunker. Unfortunately, at this critical moment, the smoke screen dissipated. He saw the bandits, and the bandits saw him. The bandits fired at him with two machine guns. Fortunately, the bullets slipped past the sides of his legs, only scratching the skin. At this time, he used a volley of machine gun fire to defeat the bandits and then occupied the Communist bandits' trenches, killing five bandits. At this time, the squad leader walked over and saw the blood flowing from his legs, mistakenly thinking that he had been seriously injured, but he firmly said: "This is nothing, just a scratch." As a result, he was selected as one of the heroes of the company.

The second person was Yao Jun, 25 years old, from Fuyang, Anhui. He was a volunteer soldier. When he was defending Xiangchengzhuang southeast of Longshan, two battalions of bandits attacked his two squads. Because of the disparity in numbers and the fact that many brothers had died in battle, and the bunker was broken into by the bandits, in a moment of extreme urgency, he cleverly placed his machine gun on the door panel on the upper level of the bunker. He hid in the weeds inside the bunker in the darkness, and the bandits neglected to see him. At dawn the next morning, the bandits suddenly retreated, and he took out his machine gun again and killed over 20 bandits, and rescued the platoon leader who had been wounded by the bandits nearby, seizing three enemy machine guns and twelve rifles.

In addition, the reporter also interviewed over a dozen people, including Private Cao Jiacheng and Huo Lianzhong. Their heroic fighting spirit left the most profound impression on me.

The next item on the program was for everyone to sit on the ground in the square for a meal. The brigade headquarters specially set up honorary seats for each combat hero, with one guest accompanying each seat. When the reporter asked the combat hero at the same table why the unit could not fight in the past but can fight now, he told me that this was entirely due to the change in the past practices of all of the company commanders, the ability of everyone to share weal and woe, and the ability of officers and soldiers to achieve a real sense of unity in their lives. One of them even said bluntly: "We are not fools. If we are asked to risk our lives entirely to maintain or establish the interests of a few people, we will not do it!"

After the celebratory banquet, there was also a performance to comfort the troops. The reporter did not have time to participate due to time constraints. On the way back, Brigade Commander Qian Baiying told me that this celebration meeting was completely learned from the Communist bandits and had a significant impact on boosting morale. Now the slogan we are following is: "Look for the shortcomings of the Communist bandits to attack the enemy, learn the strengths of the Communist bandits to attack the enemy."

The Japanese authorities charged the overseas Chinese with selling private lottery tickets without the permission of the Japanese government, violating the Criminal Law and the Securities Law. It is reported that the overseas Chinese planned to issue 70 million Japanese yen in lottery tickets to raise funds to repair the hospital, with half of the proceeds going to rebuilding the hospital and the other half going to prizes.

### Western European Union Five Foreign Ministers Meeting Today in The Hague; The Berlin Crisis Will Be The Topic of Discussion

[Our News] London 18th Broadcasting, the Berlin situation is becoming increasingly serious, the "Western European Union" five strong foreign ministers are scheduled to convene a meeting in The Hague tomorrow (19th) to decide whether to implement a showdown with the Soviet Union, or seek another way to open the Berlin situation. The United States will not send representatives to attend the meeting, but Britain will notify the United States of the meeting. The questions to be discussed are extremely delicate, so the party strictly keeps secrets. This meeting was originally a quarterly meeting scheduled by the five countries. The last meeting was held in March of this year, when the Brussels Treaty was signed. In peacetime, the scope of the meeting was limited to the progress of joint defense plans and obtaining US assistance. However, at present, because the Berlin issue has completely changed the goal of the meeting, it has shifted to how to open the Berlin deadlock and how to deal with the Soviet Union.

[Reuters, London, 18th] The most important chapter of the Western European Union will begin on the 19th when the foreign ministers of the five countries meet in The Hague. Before starting off, Foreign Minister Bevin said at Waterloo Station that he hoped that when he returned, he would obtain the military alliance treaty of the five Western European countries. Minister Pideault also stated at the Paris North Station that France would demand the recognition of the need to conclude a military alliance of five countries at the meeting in The Hague. In addition to Bevin and Pideault, those participating in the Hague meeting were Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, Dutch Foreign Minister Botsler, and Luxembourg Foreign Minister Beck. The first meeting was chaired by Dutch Foreign Minister Botsler. The main task of the meeting was to seriously deal with the long-delayed military alliance issue of the five countries. The permanent military committee of the five-nation alliance has completed a preliminary research report on the military alliance after secret discussions in London, which will be submitted for discussion at the meeting in The Hague. British Foreign Office officials revealed that Britain has also drafted a military draft treaty, which will be submitted by Bevin to the Hague meeting, and French Foreign Office officials said that France has also prepared a counter-proposal, which will be submitted by Pideault. In addition, the Hague meeting will also discuss the issue of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg assisting the Western powers with the airlift between West Germany and Berlin. It is reported that Holland is ready to supply a fleet of aircraft for the British to deploy. Although Mr. Attlee denied last week that he had requested the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to assist with the airlift, judging from the close relationship between the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg and the three powers' London negotiations, it can be concluded that under the current emergency situation, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France will never act alone. Another issue to be discussed at the Hague meeting is the unification of Western Europe's colonial policies in Africa. The uranium in the Belgian-controlled Congo and French-controlled Madagascar, and the iron ore in Southern Rhodesia, may be utilized jointly by the five Western European countries. The detailed rules and methods have been drafted by the two committees in London and Paris, and will be submitted for discussion at the Hague meeting.

### Three Powers Continue Negotiations; To Issue Another Protest to the Soviets; Soviet Concern Rises Over American Superfortresses Flying to Europe

[Reuters, London, 17th] The committee comprised of British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Strachey, U.S. Ambassador Douglas, and French Ambassador Massigli will begin daily meetings next week to monitor the Berlin situation. Simultaneously, they will study how to mobilize the military and economic power of Western allies to indefinitely maintain the Berlin airlift. The committee will also study whether the three Western powers must prepare for war over the Berlin issue, and what resources the three powers could mobilize in such a situation.

[United Press, London, 17th] Authoritative sources admit that convening a Four-Power conference to discuss the entire German problem is the only way to avoid a dangerous showdown with the Soviets over Berlin. Currently, the U.S., Britain, and France will remain silent, awaiting the outcome of the Western European Union's Five-Power conference in The Hague tomorrow before deciding on the next course of action to address the Berlin crisis. At this conference, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault will conduct a comprehensive review of the Berlin problem, seek the opinions of the Benelux countries, and then draft a reply to the Soviets.

[United Press, Washington, 17th] The U.S., Britain, and France are preparing to issue a protest to the Soviet Union over the Berlin issue. Authoritative sources state that the new note might be completed by the end of next week. These sources say that the new note will meticulously refute Moscow's blaming of the Western powers for the Berlin blockade, but will simultaneously avoid any challenging language about breaking the blockade with forceful action in the near future. Officials believe this is particularly important, as submitting the dispute to the United Nations or an international court would allow the blame for threatening peace to be placed on the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the military strength of the Western powers in Germany is insufficient to back up any threatening words.

[Reuters, Berlin, 17th] According to political figures in close contact with the Soviet military government, the Soviet Union may send a squadron of Soviet Superfortresses to Germany in response to the American deployment of sixty Superfortresses to Europe. It is said that Chief of Staff of the Soviet Military Government, Lukanchenko, Soviet Air Force Commander in Germany, Alexandrov, and other Soviet leaders in Germany held a meeting this morning in Karlshorst to consider the Soviet Union's countermeasures to the American action. Several senior Soviet officials stationed in Germany will fly to Moscow over the weekend to meet with Defense Minister Bulganin. Soviet sources in Berlin said that the arrival of American Superfortresses in Britain is more significant than any protest note, indicating that the Western allies are no longer just making political protests, but will demonstrate actual strength. The Soviet sources further stated that Soviet Superfortresses have the same firepower as American Superfortresses, but surpass the latter in range and speed. It is said that they were modeled and improved based on an American Superfortress that was forced to land in Manchuria in early 1945.

### British Parliament Decides to Adjourn, Allowing for Immediate Recall

[Reuters, London, 17th] During the ongoing Berlin crisis, the British government will request that Parliament remain in a state where it can be recalled at any time. Parliament was originally scheduled to conclude this session on July 30th. It is understood that due to the Berlin situation, Parliament will only announce an adjournment on that day. During the adjournment, the government can recall Parliament to reconvene within a day. If it were to convene another session, the King would legally be required to preside over the opening, which would take at least three days to convene.

### Soviet Air Force Day: Grand Performance in Moscow

[Reuters, London, 18th] The Soviet Union is using today, its Air Force Day, as an opportunity to declare that it will continue to strengthen its armed forces and air force, and to warn "warmongers" to recognize Moscow's strength, in response to the demonstrative action of a large number of British Superfortresses arriving in Europe. A large-scale air force exercise, including performances by jet fighters, air combat exercises, and parachute jumps, was held in Moscow on the 18th to celebrate Air Force Day. Moscow Radio reported Defense Minister Bulganin's address to the troops, emphasizing the unlimited development of the Soviet Air Force. The "Daily Chronicle," the official newspaper of the Soviet military government in Germany, specifically urged Germans to recognize the fact that the Soviet Union produces 40,000 aircraft annually. Titled "The Powerful Soviet Air Force," the newspaper instructed Western warmongers and Prussian military personnel to look at today's grand air force exercise in Moscow. An editorial in Pravda stated that the Soviet people are paying attention to the actions of warmongers, while continuing to strengthen their armed forces and air force as faithful protectors of their homeland.

### Bad Weather in Berlin Affects Airlift; Soviet Air Force Exercise Postponed

[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] Heavy rain in Berlin today has caused American aircraft participating in the airlift between West Germany and Berlin to cease operations. British aircraft, however, are continuing to land at Gatow Airport using radar-assisted blind-flying equipment. By noon, 80 British aircraft had landed in Berlin, carrying milk, flour, sugar, and other supplies. British military headquarters stated that no Soviet aircraft were detected in the Berlin air corridors today, likely due to the Soviet celebration of Air Force Day. Soviet aircraft performed flying displays throughout the Soviet zone of Germany today.

[United Press, Moscow, 18th] The Soviet air force exercise originally scheduled for today has been temporarily canceled due to bad weather and postponed to next Sunday.

### Czech Premier Travels to Romanian Capital to Sign Mutual Assistance Treaty

[Agence France-Presse, Prague, 17th] Czech Premier Zápotocký and Foreign Minister Clementis, leading a delegation, departed for Bucharest tonight to sign a Czech-Romanian treaty of friendship and mutual assistance.

[Agence France-Presse, Bucharest, 17th] Romania has decided to cancel its concordat with the Vatican. According to an official statement, this move is intended to fully implement the provisions of the new Romanian constitution regarding religious freedom.

### Czech Authorities Arrest Reactionaries; Fabricate Various Charges to Eliminate Dissent

[United Press, Prague, 18th] The people of Czechoslovakia are in a state of anxiety, awaiting the storm that has been brewing for weeks: a wave of arrests. On the evening of the 17th, the authorities unexpectedly announced that they had apprehended 79 "unhealthy" elements instigated by the United States, on charges of sabotage, terrorism, violence, and assassination. As a result, prisons are being filled. A joint statement from the Ministries of Interior and Defense accused the United States of sending spies and assassins into Czechoslovakia to "attack the people's democratic regime and serve the bidding of international imperialist reactionaries." It also warned the Czech people that enemies of the current regime "stop at nothing and resort to the most shameful crimes against humanity." Czechoslovakia is rounding up the opposition, generally accusing them of assassination, sabotage, and destruction. The head of the blacklist is a former National Socialist Party committee member accused of organizing an assassination squad, along with several former parliamentarians and leading figures from the National Socialist Party and the Catholic People's Party. The initial reaction of the Czech people to this is that "this is the beginning of the end for non-communist parties, and one-party rule will soon become a reality in our country." A month ago, the Ministry of Interior announced that it would try 55 arrested National Socialist Party members, with former Minister of Justice Prokop Drtina listed first. Drtina unsuccessfully attempted suicide after the coup and remains hospitalized. Drtina had previously uncovered a secret communist arms cache while in office, thus deepening his resentment, and four weeks ago, the Czech people marched in opposition to the communist regime, supporting President Beneš, further strengthening the Czech communist resolve to eliminate dissent.

### News from Behind the Iron Curtain: How Tito Avoided Soviet Assassination Attempt

[United Press, Paris, 18th] "France-Soir" reprinted an article on the 18th stating that the Soviet government originally planned to arrest Yugoslav Marshal Tito, secretly transport him to Soviet territory, and then publicly condemn him through the Cominform. However, Tito received a tip-off in advance and was able to escape in time. The newspaper claimed that its information came from "authoritative sources in an allied secret organization." It also stated that "the Cominform, especially its director Zhdanov, decided to capture Tito for interrogation, even executing him without trial, but Tito was exceptionally vigilant, and the plotters suffered the consequences themselves." The article claimed that the Soviet Union sent an aircraft carrying Tito and Ranković to Moscow, while one Soviet agent and one pro-Soviet agent were already in Belgrade.

### Iranian King Visits England

[Reuters, Tehran, 17th] The private plane of the Duke of Gloucester of England arrived here today to welcome the King of Iran to England. The King is scheduled to depart on the night of the 17th.

### French Cabinet Faces Serious Test Over Opposition to Military Budget Cuts; Schuman Demands Confidence Vote from Parliament

[Reuters, Paris, 17th] Premier Schuman told the National Assembly today that the maximum reduction in the defense budget that the government could accept was 8.5 billion francs. Amendments proposed by the Socialist Party and the Radical Party were unacceptable to the government, and the government would resign if either one was passed by the National Assembly. The cabinet held an emergency meeting this afternoon before the National Assembly resumed the defense budget debate in a tense atmosphere, and has likely decided to treat the amendments proposed by the Socialist Party and the Radical Party, or one of them, as an informal vote of confidence. The Socialist Party's amendment calls for a reduction of 12 billion francs in the defense budget, while the Radical Party's calls for a reduction of 1,000 francs, to express its impeachment of Defense Minister Teitgen. The effect of an informal vote of confidence is the same as a formal vote of confidence, but it does not have to wait 24 hours before being voted on, as required by the constitution. If the informal vote of confidence is not passed, the cabinet may also be forced to resign. The vote will be held on Monday.

### Jerusalem Armistice Holds, But Jewish Side Claims Arab Forces Still Firing Machine Guns and Artillery; Egypt Opposes Full Ceasefire in Holy Land

[Central News Agency, Cairo, 17th, United Press] A ceasefire order for all of Palestine is now awaiting approval from Arab leaders. Arab leaders have expressed agreement to a ceasefire in Jerusalem. According to sources in Tel Aviv, after the Arab League leaders agreed in Lebanon to accept the United Nations order, Jerusalem began a ceasefire tonight.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 18th] The Jewish radio station in Jerusalem announced that the Arab forces in the Old City of Jerusalem fired artillery and machine guns at 5:30 this morning, violating the ceasefire agreement.

[Reuters, London, 18th] Reports from Cairo say that the Egyptian forces based in southern Palestine, including in locations such as Nitzanim and Gaza, will not comply with the Security Council's ceasefire order to take effect at 3:00 PM standard time on the 18th. The Egyptian front-line commander will not only disregard the Security Council's requests, but will also ignore the Arab Higher Committee's decision to accept the ceasefire. Egypt's influential Al-Ahram newspaper, declared in a headline, "Accepting another ceasefire is tantamount to declaring the death of the Arab world. The Arab world must take a decisive and final stand against the ceasefire resolution." Arab leaders will hold a meeting before the start of the ceasefire period to decide their final stance. As the Arab side remains hesitant, the Israeli army is prepared to lay down its arms and observe the ceasefire on time. The Israeli government formally notified the United Nations on Friday of its readiness to accept the ceasefire. Israeli Foreign Minister Shertok said in Tel Aviv today that he hopes the Arabs will not force the Jewish army to continue fighting. Since the Jerusalem ceasefire began at midnight on the 16th, the area has been silent. Jewish and Arab representatives met today under the leadership of United Nations representative Vigier to determine the demarcation line between the two armies.

### Arab League Holds All-Night Meeting; No Decision Yet on War or Peace; British Officers Retired From Transjordan and Return Home

[United Press, Cairo, 18th] A dispatch from the Lebanese capital today said that the Arab leaders held an all-night meeting, and after a short break today, continued to meet to discuss whether to accept the United Nations Security Council ceasefire order.

### Split in the American Democratic Party

Southern States Oppose Protecting Black People; Nominate Separate Presidential Candidate to Compete with Truman

[Reuters, Alabama, 17th] The Southern States' Democratic Party held a secret meeting here today to prepare to secede from the Democratic Party's policies in protest against the black civil rights platform passed by the Democratic Party convention. The chairman of the meeting, former Alabama Governor Dixon, described the plan to protect black civil rights as an unconstitutional effort to reduce white people to a second-class race, destroying the future of white people and their descendants. He also frankly pointed out that the sole purpose of this black civil rights plan was to obtain votes from northern black people. The convention's resolutions committee subsequently passed a declaration insisting on the principle of racial segregation, freedom to choose associates, and opposition to civil rights initiatives.

[United Press, Birmingham, Alabama, 17th] South Carolina Governor Thurmond accepted the presidential nomination on the 17th, leading the States' Rights ticket in the southern states.

### Opposition Between Japanese Parties; Ashida Cabinet Shakes

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] Recent developments in the Japanese political situation have become more nuanced due to various instances of friction between the Democratic Party and the Socialist Party. The respective cabinet members from both parties have been giving political speeches in various locations since the 10th, and have now expressed completely opposing stances. The relationship of so-called friendly parties and the so-called policy agreements have become bewildering. Based on this deduction, the fate of the Ashida coalition cabinet has likely been decided, and its disintegration in the short term is undoubtedly certain.

### Problem of Controlling Atomic Energy to be Submitted to UN for Discussion

Remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Marshall

[United Press, Washington, 18th] Secretary of State Marshall declared today that although the United States has reached a stalemate with the Soviet Union on the issue of international control of atomic energy, it is still constantly striving to achieve it. Utilizing atomic energy for the benefit of mankind is an extremely important issue for humanity. It will be raised again for discussion when the UN General Assembly convenes in September.

### To Reduce Burden on Japan, US Plans to Sell Japanese Goods to Europe; To Undertake a Portion of the European Recovery Program

[United Press, Washington, 17th] Officials at the headquarters of the Marshall Plan here said on the 17th that they have some hope of organizing direct exports from Japan to Europe to undertake a portion of the European Recovery Program. They said they are considering increasing Japanese trade and reducing the burden on American taxpayers regarding Japan. However, they acknowledged that in the near future, the prospects of directly selling Japanese goods to Europe are not as optimistic as selling Japanese goods in European countries' Far Eastern colonies. As the United Press learned last week, great attention is being paid to the latter matter. The theoretical basis for directly exporting Japanese goods to England, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the other sixteen countries participating in the European Recovery Program is: (1) These countries need goods and equipment; (2) Japan needs to export; and (3) The United States has already allocated $4 billion to pay for goods needed by Europe. It is generally argued that some of this amount can be spent in Japan, as this would reduce the amount of funds allocated by the United States to support the Japanese economy.

### Prospects for the American Presidential Election (Part 1)

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Mao Shuqing

[New York, airmail from July 9th] People in New York and Washington generally believe that there is little doubt that the Republican presidential and vice-presidential candidates, Dewey and Warren, will be victorious in the election. The day I arrived in New York from Paris, the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia had just begun. Public opinion across the United States has a very high opinion of Dewey's "emergence." Many American magazines and periodicals have used Dewey's photograph as the cover of their latest issue.

The reasons why the Republican Party will win in November are: first, Dewey's personal prestige in American society is unmatched by other politicians. The "New Republic" magazine, once edited by Wallace, stated: "Today, there is no one in the entire United States who does not know and admire the name of Thomas Dewey. His lofty political prestige and his skillful and sophisticated campaign tactics are unmatched by any other person." In the past, during Roosevelt's four terms as president, Dewey was the only one who could compete with him. Furthermore, Republican vice-presidential candidate Governor Warren's popularity and achievements in the West Coast are also praised by Americans. In the last California gubernatorial election, Warren was nominated as the sole candidate by both the Republican and Democratic parties. When I traveled to California in 1946, I met Warren and learned of his humble, meticulous, and simple style. In the past three years, the American Pacific coast has been booming and developing at an accelerated pace, and Warren's popularity and political achievements have also contributed to Dewey's victory.

Secondly, the Democratic Party has occupied the White House for sixteen years, and the historical mission of President Roosevelt's era has passed. After Roosevelt's death, the party split, and Truman's talent, courage, and prestige were insufficient to serve as the chief executive of a world-leading country. When I filed this report, the Democratic National Convention was still three days away, and a tumultuous "dump Truman movement" was brewing within the Democratic Party. New York Mayor O'Dwyer, in his capacity as an incumbent administrative official, loudly proclaimed: "Truman is not fit for reelection, and the Democratic Party should try to save itself." New Jersey, across the river from New York, was originally a Democratic stronghold. The state's "party boss" (referred to as a "party machine" in English), Hague, said: "If the Democratic Party nominates Truman as a candidate, it would be tantamount to handing over hundreds of thousands of votes in New Jersey to the Republican Party."

Another major "machine" of the Democratic Party is the Kelly-Nash machine in Chicago (Kelly and Nash were influential supporters of Roosevelt's campaign). The current boss of the machine, Arvey, recently rushed to New York and secretly plotted with Mayor O'Dwyer to carry out the "dump Truman movement." Arvey's ideal Democratic presidential candidate was General Eisenhower. This opinion was warmly supported by Roosevelt Jr. (the eldest son of former President Roosevelt), the head of the California Democratic Party branch. Roosevelt Jr. launched a large march in Los Angeles to "nominate Eisenhower for president," which aroused a warm response from the southern states (the Democratic Party's stronghold). Senator Kefauver also said that General Eisenhower should be the most ideal candidate. (Eisenhower has publicly refused to run for election).

Eisenhower's prestige could compete with Truman, but Eisenhower himself is not a member of the Democratic Party. Eisenhower himself often comforted himself as a "non-partisan person." In his statement declining the endorsement, he repeatedly mentioned: "I do not wish to belong to any party." According to people familiar with the inside workings of American politics, Eisenhower's political relationships have been closer to the Republican Party rather than the Democratic Party. From Eisenhower's personal point of view, it would be unwise to compete with Dewey this year (New York Daily News editorial). Recently, letters and telegrams have piled up in Eisenhower's office at Columbia University, where he serves as president, all of which are letters of "persuasion." In a letter replying to a veteran in Florida, Eisenhower said: "I plan to devote myself to the most interesting educational career in the next few years. I have decided to decline any political activities."

In recent days, Eisenhower's actions have been surrounded by news reporters and political groups. Eisenhower's every move has been the best lens for news. Last night, 5,000 people claiming to be Eisenhower's "admirers" shouted slogans not far from my residence at 60 Morningside Drive, the residence of the president of Columbia University, asking Eisenhower to run for president. Eisenhower waved his hand and repeatedly said "Good night!" "Please come to the school office to talk if it is convenient!" He still did not mention political campaigning.

Some Democrats still advocate nominating Eisenhower as a presidential candidate, regardless of whether Eisenhower agrees. However, some "dump Truman" people, such as Mayor O'Dwyer, are vigorously recommending Justice Douglas of the Washington Supreme Court. Douglas is a senior Democrat and belongs to the left wing of the Democratic Party, but his prestige is far less powerful than Republican Dewey. A large portion of the Democratic Party's "orthodoxy" is still trying to win Truman over, and their slogan is: "Unite as one, with one heart and one mind, don't create opportunities for the enemy party, don't let your strength be dispersed!"

If Eisenhower could change his mind, then Eisenhower would be a formidable opponent for Dewey. But as it stands, Eisenhower will definitely not "emerge" to save the Democrats. Then Truman will undoubtedly remain the Democratic presidential candidate. If so, it will create an even more favorable opportunity for Dewey. The Republican Party may achieve an unprecedented overwhelming advantage in November.

### President of the National Bank Officially Announces Immediate Additional Issuance of Four Types of Customs Gold Notes; Denominations of 10,000, 25,000, 50,000, and 250,000

President Yu of the Central Bank gave a speech on the afternoon of the 18th, declaring: "Recently, there has been a shortage of banknotes in various places, and industries and businesses have felt difficulties in circulating capital. This bank has repeatedly received letters and telegrams from various parties requesting the issuance of banknotes with larger denominations. Responsible persons from the local chamber of commerce and the silver and money industries have also made the same request. At the same time, due to the recent surge in prices, the current denominations of banknotes are inconvenient for the public to purchase goods and carry them. There is also a need to issue banknotes with larger denominations to redeem the current banknotes. Therefore, with the approval of the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance of this bank, we will immediately issue banknotes with larger denominations, including four types: (1) Customs Gold 10,000 yuan, (2) Customs Gold 25,000 yuan, (3) Customs Gold 50,000 yuan, and (4) Customs Gold 250,000 yuan, to meet the needs and facilitate redemption." Yu also stated: "The government has a comprehensive plan to contract the currency supply and stabilize prices. The issuance of banknotes with larger denominations this time is purely to facilitate the people and meet practical needs. It only increases the denomination of banknotes and does not increase the amount of issuance, so it should not affect prices. If speculators use this to spread rumors in the hope of disrupting the financial market, they will be investigated and punished according to the law."

### Strictly Prevent Price Gouging: The Authorities Have Measures Ready

Selling Off Materials and Tightening Credit

The long-rumored large-denomination banknotes are set to be released today. To prevent speculators from taking the opportunity to spread rumors, raise prices, and harm people's livelihoods, the financial authorities have been in contact with various parties to exchange ideas for days. Although yesterday was a regular weekly holiday, Yu Hongjun, Wu Guozhen, Liu Gongyun, and heads of relevant agencies were in frequent contact. They have devised concrete and effective measures to suppress prices and tighten credit, which will be implemented starting today. Organizations such as the Yarn Control Committee will also sell off large quantities of materials such as cotton yarn, cloth, and sugar to increase market supply and vigorously tighten credit. In addition, the security authorities will severely punish those who spread rumors, raise prices, and manipulate the market in accordance with the Emergency Measures for Disrupting Financial and Economic Order during the Suppression of Rebellion.

### Dispatching Additional Personnel to Monitor the Market

It is reported that, to prevent speculative and illegal merchants from taking advantage of the Central Bank's issuance of large-denomination banknotes to disrupt the financial market and raise prices, the military and political authorities of this city have decided to dispatch additional personnel today to monitor various markets. The Central Bank and various agencies owning materials will also sell off goods at any time depending on the market situation to curb the rising trend.

### Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters Joint Meeting of Cadres: Chairman Fang Proposes Ideas for Reforming Party Affairs

The Kuomintang Central Committee's Review Meeting on Reforming Party Affairs is about to be held. The Shanghai Municipal Party specially convened a joint meeting of cadres at Huzhou Society on Guizhou Road at 9 a.m. yesterday to provide ideas for reforming party affairs. More than 800 people attended, including all executive and supervisory committee members of the Municipal Party Headquarters, committee members of various district (branch) party headquarters, and cadres at all levels. Chairman Fang personally presided over the meeting, and the atmosphere was extremely harmonious.

Seeking Progress and Unity

In his speech at the meeting, Chairman Fang first analyzed the current unstable phenomena in society in detail, and urged party comrades to work hard to alleviate the people's suffering. He then put forward the principles of reforming party affairs, explaining that the Kuomintang is a political party with 60 years of glorious history. Today's reform aims to seek progress and unity, so that it can continue to strive for the new life of the party under the leadership of a unified organization and a single leader. Any reckless division will not be tolerated. Fang then pointed out with a tone of regret that party members in politics, once they become officials, only know how to be officials and forget that they are party comrades; they only know bureaucracy and forget the Three Principles of the People, causing many members of the party to be slandered. Therefore, in the future reform of party affairs, party headquarters at the same level should have the power to remove party members in politics at the same level.

Reform Should Be Thorough

After Fang's speech, cadres at all levels took the floor enthusiastically. The main points of their speeches are summarized as follows: (1) The task of reforming party affairs cannot be completed by a few central committee members alone. The will of all party members must be solicited. Therefore, the central government should be requested to convene a national congress as soon as possible to review party affairs and seek genuine reform. (2) The government should be requested to implement the program of the Principle of People's Livelihood to achieve equalization of land ownership and restriction of capital. (3) This reform should be thorough, avoiding bureaucratic style and preventing those who use the name of reform to engage in other attempts. The meeting adjourned at around 12 noon.

### Second Propaganda Training Class Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday

The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, in view of the great importance of propaganda work during the period of suppressing rebellion and suppressing bandits, specially held the second training class for propaganda workers. The opening ceremony was held at Yucai Middle School on Shanhai Pass Road at 8 p.m. yesterday. All members of the Municipal Party Headquarters and more than 200 trainees attended. Chairman Fang personally presided over the ceremony. After the ceremony, he delivered a speech on the spot, giving instructions and encouragement. Next, Dean Tan Yimin reported on the preparations and the statistics on the trainees' occupations, educational backgrounds, and ages. Finally, guests delivered speeches successively. The ceremony was completed at 10 p.m. It is reported that there are more than 160 trainees in the class, all of whom are selected from various district party headquarters. Their training level is at the high school and university levels.

### Economic Police Temporarily Suspend Investigation of Yarn Numbers, Intensify Investigation of Bank Notes

The Economic Police Brigade of the Municipal Police Department is currently heavily burdened with monitoring market transactions. The work of general investigation of yarn numbers has been temporarily suspended. In the future, the brigade will assist the Financial Management Bureau in intensifying the investigation of bank notes to thoroughly prevent speculation.

### Public Utility Employees Request Restoration of Rice Subsidy

Employees of the city's six major public utilities used to enjoy a rice subsidy of 120 pounds per month before the Anti-Japanese War, as well as educational subsidies for employees' children. These were canceled after the city fell into enemy hands. Recently, the employees plan to make a request to the companies to restore the rice subsidy and educational subsidies. The employees of the telephone company, etc., have initiated discussions. However, the companies' burdens have increased sharply in recent months, and they have no profits. In fact, it may be difficult to do so.

### Public School Teachers to Receive Half-Month Salary Increase: Municipal Finance Bureau to Issue Tomorrow

[Report from this newspaper] The authorities, in order to ease the difficult living conditions of public school teachers, especially when the price increases of June have just passed, and the price increases of July are following, have decided to increase the June salary by half a month. After receiving the order, the municipal government made every effort to raise funds. According to the Municipal Finance Bureau yesterday, the half-month salary increase is expected to be issued tomorrow.

### Joint Inspection Team Established Today

The joint inspection team of the military, police, constabulary, navy, army, and air force has been officially established today and will begin inspection work immediately.

### Railway Bureau Conducts Solemn Test Run: Express Train's Maiden Voyage This Morning If Everything is Satisfactory, Service Will Begin on the 22nd

[Report from this newspaper] The "Express Train," the most complete, newest, and fastest train in the history of Chinese railways, named by Minister of Communications Yu himself, has been completed yesterday after more than a year of hard work by the Qishuyan Locomotive Factory of the two railway bureaus. The entire train is scheduled to depart from the Qishuyan Factory at 5:20 a.m. this morning for a test run, arriving in Suzhou at 6:20 a.m. After stopping for five to ten minutes, it will return to the factory at 7:30 a.m. The various parts of the machine will be subjected to a strict and thorough inspection again. If the results are good, another test run to Shanghai will be conducted tomorrow morning, either in the early morning or late at night. If the test run results are completely satisfactory, it can be officially added to the Beijing-Shanghai line on the 22nd of this month.

Traveling Between Beijing and Shanghai, Only Stopping at Zhenjiang and Wuxi

For the addition of this train, the Railway Bureau has specially adjusted the entire line's train schedule. The upbound express train (Train No. 202) departs from Shanghai North Station at 7:30 a.m., stopping at Wuxi and Zhenjiang along the way, and arriving at Nanjing Xiaguan Station at 12:30 p.m. The downbound express train (Train No. 201) departs at 6:00 p.m. and arrives at Shanghai North Station at 11:00 p.m.

Ticket Prices

After repeated consultations among the heads of various departments of the Railway Bureau, the ticket prices for the express train were drafted by the Transportation Department yesterday. Shanghai to Nanjing is 6 million yuan, to Zhenjiang is 5.72 million yuan, and to Wuxi is 3.95 million yuan. The Transportation Department immediately submitted this ticket price to Director Chen Bozhuang for final decision on the same day.

Factory Director Gao Talks About the Reasons for the Delay

According to Gao Zhenzhou, director of the Qishuyan Locomotive Factory, the air-conditioning equipment, comfortable chairs, radios, and paint of the observation car of the train were all completed at 5:00 a.m. on the 15th of this month. However, the generator that supplies power to the entire train's air conditioning broke down, so the factory departure period had to be postponed. The new generator was just shipped from the United States a few days ago and replaced. It was rushed to be installed and completed day and night, and the power generation performance was very satisfactory. Therefore, the air-conditioning part should no longer have any problems.

Train Hostesses Provide Services on the Train

For the train attendants on the express train, the Railway Bureau has specially selected the most outstanding personnel and subjected them to strict training. Five "train hostesses" were also tried out to serve in the observation car's bar and dining car. The Railway Bureau had very high standards when recruiting. It is said that all five "train hostesses" are high school graduates. The selection of women as train service personnel is an innovation this time, and it is expected that "train hostesses" will become a new profession for women after "air hostesses."

### Director of Taiwan Provincial Railway Bureau, Lang Zhong, Leaves Shanghai and Returns to Taiwan

Lang Zhong, Director of the Taiwan Provincial Railway Bureau, came to Shanghai and turned to Beijing to discuss the allocation of US aid. He has now completed his official duties and left Shanghai on the 18th on the Jingxing transport ship to return to Taiwan. It is reported that the results of the negotiations were quite satisfactory. Also, Lang had an audience with President Weng in Beijing to report on the current situation of the Taiwan Railway. President Weng praised Lang's achievements.

### August Rice Ration Coupons Distributed to Households on Schedule

If citizens do not receive the ration coupons at that time, they can collect them from the neighborhood chiefs on the 29th and 30th. The school rice ration coupons for this month will also be distributed to the district offices by district from the 22nd to the 24th, and the original applicant units will prepare and go to the district offices to collect and distribute them. As for the August poverty relief coupons, they will still be distributed by the neighborhood chiefs to poor households for signature on the 31st of this month in accordance with the original plan.

### Two Places Discover Queuing to Buy Rice

Yesterday, although it was the weekly holiday and the markets were closed, the retail price of rice in the food market soared. High-quality white japonica rice reached the 40 million yuan mark. In the household rice retail stores in the Jiangning and Putuo districts of western Shanghai, the poor were found queuing up to buy allocated rice in the afternoon yesterday. The police station in charge dispatched armed police officers to the rice stores to protect them and maintain order.

### Perpetrators of Two Theater Incidents to be Tried Today by Garrison Headquarters

The Military Law Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters decided to initially interrogate the perpetrators of the bloody cases at the Grand Dance Hall and the Co-Stage Theater on the evening of the 16th this morning. The 9th Regiment of the Military Police had completed the investigation report yesterday. The 23 perpetrators originally scheduled to be transferred to the Garrison Headquarters yesterday were changed to be escorted this morning due to the weekly holiday. As for the three soldiers Huang Rong, Li Hongren, and Qu Wenzhong of the Independent Brigade's 5th Regiment who carried hand grenades while watching a play at the Co-Stage Theater, the person in charge has promised to escort them to the Garrison Headquarters this morning.

### Two Airlines to Adjust Fares Starting Tomorrow: Approved by Ministry of Communications, Price Increase of One and a Half Times

China and Central Airlines have reduced the number of flights and suspended the Beijing-Shanghai line since yesterday due to insufficient fares to maintain costs. According to accurate information, the Ministry of Communications has approved an adjustment of aircraft fares by 150%, which will be officially implemented from the 20th (tomorrow).

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th] China Airlines will readjust ticket prices as follows from the 20th of this month: (1) Boeing, Beiping-Qingdao 102 million yuan, Beiping-Shanghai 207 million yuan, Beiping-Hong Kong 567 million yuan.

### Stocks Denominated in Taiwan Dollars to be Listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange

[Report from this newspaper] Stocks denominated in Taiwan dollars will soon be listed and traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. A certain state-owned industrial and mining company in Taiwan has a large scale, with more than 40 units including coal mines, textiles, steel, and other industries. The development of its business is also quite smooth. Steel production has doubled compared with the Japanese colonial era. However, due to the lack of capital in Taiwan Province, loans from national banks are not a fundamental solution. A plan has recently been formulated to issue 30% of the company's shares for public listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. This plan will soon be approved by the Taiwan Provincial Government, and then submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval for listing. It is also said that this kind of Taiwan dollar stock has been printed in Shanghai. Because it is calculated based on the value of 1945, the face value is not large. However, because the value of Taiwan dollars is adjusted from time to time due to rising prices, it is expected that the market for this kind of stock will be good after listing.

### The Miserable "Shanghai Young Master": Bowing His Head Before the Price Surge Waking Up From a Luxurious Dream and Starting to Taste the Bitterness of Life

[Special Report from This Newspaper] For decades, Shanghai has always been the gold rush and entertainment district in the minds of the public. It seems that anyone can easily start from scratch and live a carefree life as long as they mess around in this city for two years. Look at the people weaving back and forth on the road. Aren't there many standard "young master" types striding forward? The definition of "young master" is quite difficult to explain. Anyway, he is elegant, knows a little bit about human relationships, has a mind for dealing with the world, and has enough food at home to last a few days. At least, in the eyes of ordinary servants, he is always a "young master."

The rapid disappearance of the golden age of Shanghai young masters has only happened recently. Several intense price surges in a row have destroyed the foundation for carefree enjoyment. Young masters have only begun to taste the bitterness of taking every bit and using it like mud. According to statistics: cinema revenue has plummeted after price increases, and upper-middle-class Western clothing stores are desolate. Also, night gardens and dance halls are completely relying on middle-aged and older people to prop up the scene. Now the young masters are already powerless.

What the young masters find most heartbreaking is that movie tickets have increased to 2 million. What kind of mass entertainment is this? Let's line up to buy tickets at a limited price. What a long line! If, by chance, you encounter your nemesis and your lover gracefully arrives, then your face will be lost, and what will you do? After careful consideration, the result is to buy a synopsis and read it carefully. Understanding the plot can also be a consolation. But walking out the door, the luxurious scenes on those advertisements are really tempting, making people feel discouraged and weak all over. Calling a pedicab, asking for 300,000, the young master faintly bargained for half the price. The pedicab driver more faintly replied: "I can't afford to ride it! Let's walk!" What? Can't afford to ride it? This insult made the young master feel too embarrassed.

In fact, there are many more embarrassing things! Young masters have rarely gone to dance halls recently, but they can't help but go occasionally. It is said that the tea fee has exceeded 1 million. The courage to summon a dance girl to sit with you suddenly disappears. Two well-known waiters still compete to show enthusiasm: "Young master, Zhenzhen is calling you!" Really, isn't Zhenzhen also showing you a tempting smile? But why is she so entangled with ordinary old men? Just like in the past, she was by your side. The melody is leisurely, and the scenery of the dance floor is no different. The past is not necessarily a dream! Several price surges have made the young masters bow their heads.

It's Difficult to Add New Clothes; Old Clothes Stacked in the Trunk

If the price surge only revolves around the entertainment sector, the young masters can still endure it as much as possible. But in fact, clothing and food expenses are also constantly challenging the young masters' appearance. Vitamin supplements costing tens of millions have not been taken for a long time, and even a bowl of pork rib noodles costs 600,000. Malnutrition, dull complexion, what about further studies? What about work efficiency? Where do you start talking about it! A Western suit costs 300 million. From head to toe, if you want to look neat and tidy, it will cost 600 million. The young masters can't prepare new clothes, but the old clothes are indeed quite impressive. Before going to bed in the evening, take them out of the trunk, one by one, carefully folded. Thinking of the grace and demeanor that he had adorned with these clothes in the past few years, he pointed to the box and said to the maid: "Don't look down on it. This little fortune was enough to open ten banks before the war!"

One evening, a young master came to a fortune-telling stall near the Great World. He told the blind gentleman that he was indeed a "young master," with deep ancestors and a small fortune. But in the recent price surge, he was also stretched thin. So he wanted to calculate when the price surge would subside. The blind gentleman was startled and quickly shook his head: "This is a catastrophe! You can't calculate it." The young master didn't seem to be used to hearing the word "catastrophe." He laughed and said: "At least the young master doesn't do it, isn't it the same as being a street runner for speculative bosses and a guide for underwater divers?"

How Can You Bear to Come Back to the Old Place Again? All are Worried About Firewood and Rice

A gardener in a park in the West District once witnessed this fact: A pair of lovers appeared in the depths of the lush forest last spring. The man was a "young master" from a certain family near the park. They snuggled together and lingered all day long. They got married in less than a month. It is a matter of course for a "young master" to get married. There is nothing to discuss. But he went on to say: The night before last, they brought their child to the park again. This was the first time this year. They still sat in the old place. As soon as they sat down, the couple quarreled. The center of the quarrel was originally to save expenses. This scene is sad enough to imagine. Gentle love, how long ago? The sound of bamboo and the new moon are still like those of the year, but after several price surges, the Shanghai young master collapsed so sadly.

### Theater Industry Has Difficulty Maintaining Operations: Hoping Military Personnel Will Understand Business Difficulties Theater Business Association Expresses Opinions

In the case of a soldier throwing a grenade at the Grand Stage and the Co-Stage theaters a few days ago, the business of theaters throughout the city has suddenly declined. According to the Shanghai Theater Business Association, the theater industry was originally in a state of collapse due to market turmoil, reduced audiences, and increased prices and expenses. However, they have been trying their best to support it and temporarily prolong their breath. In recent years, they have been constantly disturbed, and they deeply feel the difficulty of doing business. They are grateful for the maintenance of the authorities, the sympathy of all parties, and the assistance of all parties, so that they can barely maintain it until now.

However, such a major unfortunate event happened again yesterday, endangering the safety of employees and audiences. It is really impossible for the industry to survive. The city's one hundred and dozens of theaters feel the seriousness of the danger, and they all advocate immediate closure due to the difficulty of doing business in the future. Yesterday afternoon, the association held an emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors, saying that at a time of suppressing rebellion, a complete closure would inevitably affect social tranquility. They strongly urged their colleagues to take the overall situation into consideration and continue to operate as usual. The loyal and brave soldiers have been fighting hard and bathing in blood, which they have always admired. However, it is not easy for merchants to make a living. They hope to understand the difficulties of merchants and give them more maintenance, so that the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people in the city who depend on the theater industry will not be interrupted, and citizens can obtain legitimate entertainment." According to the industry association, "The prices are so high now, the industry's expenses are huge, and it is difficult to maintain operations. The cost of living index for the first half of the month announced a few days ago has increased by almost double compared with the past. The salary issued to employees alone is difficult to bear, and it has already been on the verge of collapse and cannot withstand accidents." The industry is also deeply grateful for the temporary suppression of the military, constabulary, and police this time.

### Municipal Industry Association Completes Preparations Officially Announces Solicitation of Membership

The preparatory committee of the Municipal Industry Association has completed its preparations and officially announced the solicitation of membership from various industry associations from today. All notices and forms have been sent out yesterday. The membership fee has been set at twice the base number of the membership fee, which is calculated based on the civil servant cost of living index of 1.07 million times for the first half of July. The deadline for registration is the end of this month at the latest. The inaugural meeting is scheduled to be held in early August, in principle on Sunday, so that all members can attend. At that time, representatives from various industries, local officials, and the press will be invited to participate, and a declaration will be issued. The preparatory committee has appointed a declaration drafting committee to rush to draft it so that it can be publicized to the country at the inaugural meeting.

### Bookbinding Workers Strike Yesterday, Demanding Change to Base Salary System

The bookbinding workers in this city started a strike yesterday. The reason is that the workers' wages have not been calculated according to the cost of living index, and they only get between 4 million and 5 million yuan per month, which is really difficult to maintain life. The Municipal Printing Industry Union has sent letters to the industry association twice, requesting that the base salary be changed to 35 to 40 yuan, calculated according to the cost of living index, but the management has ignored it. Therefore, the workers are indignant and have started a strike. The union will submit a request to the Social Affairs Bureau for handling.

### Master Fafang Returns From Overseas

[Report from this newspaper] Master Fafang recently returned from overseas and is temporarily residing at the Jade Buddha Temple. He will be going to Beijing soon. The master has studied in countries such as Siam. His return to China will contribute to culture, religion, and society. The Shanghai Buddhist Youth Association's Xin Guang Sunday Lecture invited the master to speak on "Buddhism and Indian Philosophy" yesterday morning, and a banquet was held at noon to welcome him.

### Wilson Arrives Today

[Report from this newspaper] The American President Lines' new mail ship, President Wilson, is arriving in Shanghai for the second time. It is scheduled to arrive at 11 a.m. today, docking at the Hongkou Gonghexing Wharf, and will leave Shanghai at 10 a.m. on the 21st, returning to San Francisco via Yokohama. Passengers must board the ship before 9:30 a.m. on the 21st.

### Shanghai Nurses: Diligently Battling Death Day and Night, Reclaiming Lives from the Brink

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Municipal Police Department's Fire Brigade operates an emergency ambulance corps for citizens, which people have nicknamed "Shanghai Nurses." Using five ambulances as the backbone, each vehicle is equipped with one nurse, three police officers, and one driver. A doctor serves as the central command. The diligent service of these public nurses has snatched many lives from the hands of death.

On this particular day, the "Shanghai Nurses" first went into action at 2:03 AM. In the Fire Brigade building on Henan Road, the telephone with the number "18600" rang especially loudly in the quiet night. The alert officer on duty answered the call. In less than a minute, a white ambulance sped out. The call came from Minsheng Company at 378 Dongda Road. The ambulance raced through the quiet streets shrouded in darkness and quickly arrived at its destination. The victim was a worker named Wan Xiaobao, whose foot had been crushed by a copper box. His left big toe was completely fractured, and he was bleeding profusely. This type of injury was considered minor by the "Shanghai Nurses" staff, who had seen much worse and rescued many injured and ill people on the verge of death. They effortlessly lifted the worker into the ambulance, washed the wound with gauze and cotton, and bandaged the injured foot with a triangular splint and tourniquet. Meanwhile, the ambulance was already heading towards the nearest Shanghai Health Sanatorium. After arriving at the hospital, they handed the patient over to the hospital staff, thus completing their first mission. The ambulance returned to the Fire Brigade in the still-silent streets. Faint moonlight began to appear in the previously pitch-black sky.

Spending Time in Tension From that moment on, the "Shanghai Nurses" spent their busy day constantly in tension. At 5:20 AM, a section member at the Jiangwan Police Sub-bureau suddenly had a relapse of an old illness, but by the time the ambulance arrived, he had recovered and refused to go to the hospital. The "Shanghai Nurses" had made a wasted trip. At 6:44 AM, a Mr. Shen on Raul Road fell from a building, injuring his face and deeply lacerating his nose. He was constantly dizzy, so the "Shanghai Nurses" took him to the Red Cross Hospital. At 6:56 AM, a Mr. and Mrs. Jia on Guangxi Road were stabbed by an enemy with a knife. The man lost too much blood and was unconscious, while the woman was only slightly injured. Both were sent to Renji Hospital. At 7:41 AM, a Mr. Zhuang at the intersection of Jiangsu Road and Yuyuan Road was riding a bicycle and was run over by a truck. By the time he was taken to the hospital, his heartbeat and breathing had stopped, and resuscitation was unsuccessful. At 8:45 AM, someone on Bailinan Road had abdominal pain and vomiting. At 9:15 AM, someone on Jianguo Middle Road fell from a roof. At 9:34 AM, a house collapsed on Fangbang Road in Xiaodongmen, injuring people. At 9:54 AM, someone on Beijing East Road was vomiting blood. At 10:45 AM, someone on Beijing Road suffered a sudden illness. At 1:00 PM, someone at 119 Zhaopu Road called for the "Shanghai Nurses," but by the time they arrived, the patient had already been taken elsewhere. At 1:39 PM, a member of the Hongkou District team, surnamed Song, suffered from acute appendicitis. At 2:40 PM, there was a fight at Longhua Temple, and a Mr. Ye suffered a chest contusion with possible fractures. ... At 5:38 PM, a young boy surnamed Weng on Huiming Road was bitten in the left leg by a dog ... At 7:12 PM, a boatman on the Suzhou River was scalded by boiling water ... At 8:15 PM, someone in a hotel near the Great World took poison ... At 11:18 PM, a navy soldier at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road was hit by a tram ... The final call of the day was at 8:20 PM when a resident named Xue Xingsheng on Maigen Road and Tokyo Road had drunk too much alcohol and was unconscious. The "Shanghai Nurses" took him to Hongren Hospital.

First Aid Given in the Vehicle Similar to the emergency rescues of that day, the "Shanghai Nurses" regularly provide free service to citizens. Their staff works in shifts, day and night. As soon as they receive a call, they drive the ambulance to pick up the injured or ill person, bandage and apply medication for first aid in the vehicle, and then transfer the patient to the hospital, entrusting the patient to the hospital before completing their mission. In July, they have to go out thirty-three times a day. From 1934 to June of this year, they responded to a total of 10,067 emergency calls, rescued 10,356 people, treated 1,628 epidemic cases, and rescued 1,675 people. What they are fighting for is time. If you see a white ambulance with the telephone number "18600" painted on it speeding through the crowded streets with its siren blaring, this is the "Shanghai Nurses" doing their duty for the citizens.

### Chinese Laborers on Australian Island Refuse to Board Ship to Return Home

Australian Officials Shoot and Kill Four

[Reuters, Sydney, 17th] On Nauru Island, an Australian territory located west of the Gilbert Islands on the equator, a conflict occurred between Chinese laborers and Australian officials. The officials opened fire, resulting in the immediate deaths of two Chinese laborers and two others who later died from their injuries. The Chinese laborers were hired to work on the island for a period of two years. Recently, their term expired, but the laborers refused to board the ship to return to China. They set up barricades and armed themselves with shovels, axes, sticks, and other weapons, and threw stones at the Australian officials. The officials ordered them to lay down their weapons, but they refused and instead charged towards the officials. The officials first fired shots over the heads of the laborers, but this failed to stop their advance. Chaos ensued, resulting in deaths and injuries. There were a total of 1,500 Chinese laborers serving their terms. Australian Overseas Minister Walter declined to comment on the matter before receiving an official report.

### Heroes on Heroes' Slope: Kuling's Two Thousand Sedan Chair Carriers Support the Crown of Summer Resort

— Special Correspondent Liu Wenqu

[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Kuling, 15th] In the sweltering heat, even the comfortable Shanghai-Kuling联运 (Lianyun) bus cannot resist the scorching power. Nanchang is one of China's four hottest cities; by 7:00 AM, one is already sweating profusely. Jiujiang at noon is somewhat cool. Taking a car to Lianhua Cave brings a slight breeze. Only ten or so miles away from the summer resort, I thought to myself, "In two hours, what can the heat do to me!" Choosing a mountain sedan chair, I broke through the encirclement of the chair carriers, stepped in, and watched the carriers start. The swaying chair poles gave a slightly light feeling, and my heart was full of longing for the coolness of the mountain - but it wasn't to be.

Eight Shoulders Carrying One Person Climbing a mountain is not easy. "A summer resort" is not easy to ascend. Now, eight feet have replaced two, and eight shoulders bear the weight of a hundred and several dozen pounds and the responsibility for one person's safety. The chair carriers' outfits are mostly the same: bare backs (only a very few wear short jackets), a strip of white or blue cloth draped over their shoulders, rubbing the flesh of their right shoulder (which must be switched to the left shoulder after a while) against the stiff carrying pole. A black or blue cloth belt is tied around their waists, and the trouser legs are rolled up. They are barefoot, wearing a pair of straw sandals. Their chests, backs, arms, and thighs are bronze-colored, showing health and strength. They are all young men in their twenties and thirties, but as soon as they lift the chair and take big steps, sweat immediately appears on their backs, turning from the size of rice grains to the size of soybeans. Unable to stay, it carves gullies on their backs, rolling down, wetting their waistbands, trouser legs, and straw sandals. The person sitting in the chair is exactly facing this scene - personal happiness built on the suffering of others! The hoped-for enjoyment of coolness and the appreciation of the mountain scenery are dispelled by this scene. Watching the chair carriers sweat, feelings of sympathy and pity arise in one's heart, and one cannot help but feel hot.

Nearly two thousand chair carriers support the crown of Kuling as a "summer resort." They replace the stream of visitors in sweating profusely, and they exchange the intense heat for the coolness of the vacationers.

Sweat Not Wasted Of course, the chair carriers' sweat is not wasted, and their lives depend on their shoulders and legs. The current price for a mountain chair from Shuhua Cave to Kuling is 5.8 million yuan. Passengers weighing more than 160 pounds require two additional chair carriers, costing an additional 2.9 million yuan. Out of the 5.8 million yuan, 1 million yuan is for medical expenses for the chair carriers who were beaten and injured in the previous strike. Each chair carrier receives only 970,000 yuan, with the rest going to the management fee of the administrative bureau. Due to the large number of chair carriers and the lack of overly enthusiastic tourists, it is lucky to be able to take one turn a day, going back and forth thirty miles, earning 970,000 yuan.

Unresolved Old Case Generally speaking, the chair carriers of Kuling are divided into two gangs: one is the local gang, with approximately 1,400 people, and the other is the Hubei gang, with approximately 500 people. The strike in early July was initiated by the local gang. The administrative bureau wanted the Hubei gang to maintain transportation, and the local gang took their anger out on the Hubei gang. When they were eating, a sudden attack came. The Hubei gang chair carriers were "sitting at home when disaster fell from the sky." A whirlwind of violence resulted in seven seriously injured, over twenty slightly injured, and two missing. The case is being heard by the Jiujiang District Court and has not yet been resolved. This is just a chance event. After the incident, the two sides did not seem to harbor any hatred, and transportation between Lianhua and Kuling was restored. They shouldered the heavy load again.

From Summer to Autumn Living fills the days, and they continue to climb up and down, carrying vacationers to visit scenic spots. It is easy for a single man to get by, but most of them have families, wives and children, living in Lianhua Cave, relying on their shoulders and legs to support them. "Living expenses are high, and a pair of straw sandals costs 50,000 yuan!" This is their catchphrase.

The best time for business is from 5:00 AM to 7:00 PM, when they can make three round trips. But that is rare in a summer. Being able to carry the chair twice will attract countless envious glances. If one does not get a turn once a day, one can only blame bad luck.

In a summer, there is generally no shortage of business. Vacationers throw large amounts of money at Kuling, and the chair carriers also share a portion to support their families. When autumn and winter come, the problems arise. In winter, it is rare for anyone to go up the mountain, so the local gang all return to the fields and start the busy farming season in July. The Hubei gang has no land, so they have to do odd jobs or cut firewood on barren mountains. That life is even more difficult, so they would rather sweat profusely to earn the 970,000 yuan.

Lucky Members of the Presidential Residence The chair carriers in the Presidential Residence total eighteen people, one of whom is the leader. Every eight people carry a mountain chair, one for the President and one for the First Lady. Another person is a substitute. They are only busy for a while when the President goes up the mountain. However, the President rarely goes up the mountain more than twice a year, and each time he rarely stays for a month. Therefore, their work throughout the year may only be one or two months, and the rest of the time they have nothing to do. The busiest time was in the summer of 1946, when the KMT-CPC negotiations were in full swing. The President and his wife stayed on the mountain for a long time, and Marshall came and went nine times. Marshall had a special sedan chair prepared, also carried by eight people. These eight people were selected from the two thousand chair carriers in Lianhua Cave, and they also had a good summer.

Hope for This Year This year, the chair carriers have great hopes. There are quite a few vacationers in Kuling, especially foreigners. The chair carriers are preparing more sweat and more strength to serve the vacationers who want to enjoy themselves. Heroes' Slope has more than nine hundred steps. It takes at least twenty minutes to climb this section of the road. This group of chair carriers are all well-trained "heroes." They have not considered the ruggedness of the path, let alone the scorching sun or the torrential rain. They will continue to support the crown of "summer resort" with their shoulders and legs.

### Lobotomy (4) New Achievements of Young Doctor Liu Mingduo

— Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi

[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Qingdao, 12th] On July 8th, Doctor Liu Mingduo gave a special report at the Qingdao Medical Association, talking about the method of performing frontal lobe lobotomy. He said: "Regarding the method of frontal lobe lobotomy: anesthesia can be Avertin or Ether mixed with oil for rectal anesthesia, or general anesthesia. Make a transverse incision 6cm from the upper edge of the cheekbone and the outer angle of the eyebrow on the supraorbital margin, or an arc-shaped incision. Separate the temporalis muscle, find the frontal-parietal suture of the skull, and open the skull with a skull trephine at that location. Cut the dura mater and cut the frontal lobe cortex vertically with a sharp blade. Then, put a blunt metal plate into the cut in the cortex and cut the white matter until the cerebral falx, Teritorium Cerebrum. Move the metal in a fan-shaped direction to complete the cutting. But be careful not to damage the temporal lobe and the posterior part of the frontal lobe. If the cut in the frontal lobe is too forward or too shallow, the surgical result will be poor or ineffective. If it is too far back, it will damage the motor center, the speech motor center, and the writing center. If it is too deep, it will injure the cerebral falx and cause unstoppable bleeding. Therefore, the position and depth of the incision are particularly important."

He held up a skull specimen and showed me the site of the burr hole and incision, and then drew a sketch. Two mental patients, He He and An Shuwen (a patient unable to speak), were operated on here. The location is approximately the upper-posterior area of the so-called two "temples." Wen Huisheng (epilepsy combined with left hemiplegia) had his skull opened on the right side of his head.

Each operation takes two hours. Opening the skull takes the longest time, and most of the surgical time is spent on this. After the incision is sutured, the skull will slowly grow back.

A patient with shaven hair, anesthetized, lies on the operating table, illuminated by bright shadowless lights. The head is wrapped in gauze, exposing only the surgical site. A group of doctors surrounds them, several pairs of hands tending to the opened hole, blood flowing. There are only footsteps, the clinking of metal instruments, and short, low whispers in the operating room. The scene is no different from other operations. The skull is opened, revealing the mysterious brain, which is active, the blood vessels pulsing faintly. This soft life is displayed in view. The key point of the operation begins at this time, and the incision is sutured immediately in a few minutes. Doctor Liu Mingduo's surgery is successful.

How many madmen in the world are urgently awaiting this effective cut! (End of the entire manuscript)

### Reproduction Farm for Chiah Stone Sheep: The Corriedale Breed Develops in a Vigorous Climate

— By Our Reporter Chen Jianxiong

[Our Newspaper Jiaxing 14th Dispatch] The Jia region has always been known as a land of fish and rice, and in terms of its products, it is indeed an economic treasure. There is rice to eat, silk and wool to wear, rapeseed in Pinghu, tobacco leaves in Tongxiang, bricks and tiles in Jiashan... It can be said that there is nothing lacking in the daily necessities of life. Why is it that the farmers of the Jia region today still complain of hardship? This is entirely due to the farmers' ignorance of improvement and their adherence to old methods.

The former Tenth District Commissioner's Office, in order to exploit this treasure, cooperated with the Livestock Experiment Station of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and in October of last year, selected a site at the foot of Dongshan Mountain in Chiah Stone, Hai'ning, to establish a Jia District Sheep Breeding Farm, using the Australian "Corriedale" sheep breed to improve the local sheep breeds of the Jia District.

Currently, the farm has a total of 100 "Corriedale" sheep. "Corriedale" is a world-renowned breed with fine, long, and soft wool. The wool on its head alone can reach more than four inches in length and can be spun into 56-count yarn, which is about three times longer than the local breed on average. It is sheared once a year, yielding about nine catties. It is said that the local breed can only yield about two catties per year, so the quantity is also three times greater. According to the farm's estimate, if the Jia District has 300,000 local sheep, producing a total of 600,000 catties of wool, if all of them can be improved with the "Corriedale" breed, the wool production can reach 1.8 million catties. Furthermore, if the selling price per catty is 50% higher than that of the local breed, then the true contribution to the economy of the entire Jia District would be incomparable to things like "agricultural loans."

The method of improving local sheep breeds is to use a progressive system. A purebred "Corriedale" ram is used to mate with local sheep, and the resulting lambs are the first generation of improved breeds. The wool quality and quantity of this generation of improved breeds can only be increased by one time compared to the local sheep. Then, this generation of improved breeds is mated with purebred "Corriedale" sheep, and the resulting second generation will have wool quality and quantity that are one-third of that of the purebred. After three such matings, the improved breeds will have the same wool quality and quantity as the purebreds.

Currently, the farm has surveyed ten locations in Jiaxing's Wangdian, Haiyan's Shendang, Wuyuan, Hai'ning's Yuanhua, Jinshidun, Chang'an, Chongde's Zhi Bridge, Andeng Bridge, the urban area, and Tongxiang's urban area to establish mating stations, which are actively underway. Each mating station is equipped with two or more purebred "Corriedale" sheep. Each purebred sheep can naturally mate with a maximum of 300 sheep. Since the Jia District has a large number of local sheep, the farm is not limited by the number of matings. Director Xu of the farm has previously gone to Beijing to request artificial insemination equipment. Once the equipment arrives, the number of matings will be increased threefold. This economic development endeavor will undoubtedly provide considerable economic assistance to the farmers of the Jia District.

### Yang Mei's Hunger Strike Mystery Fully Revealed; Only 21 Days of Hunger Endured; Confirmed to Have Secretly Eaten Multiple Times; Chongqing Health Bureau Stops Active Inspections; Fabricators of Mystification Are Truly Unforgivable

[Our Newspaper Chongqing 17th Dispatch] (Late Dispatch) The Yang Mei Research Committee today issued a public statement saying: The Health Bureau appointed Doctor Gan Tianyou to preside over and secretly monitor Yang Mei, and discovered the following facts: At 9:00 AM on the 3rd, she ate congee, about one bowl. At 8:00 AM on the 4th, she ate about half a bowl of salted soybeans. At 12:00 PM on the 4th, she secretly entered someone else's bedroom, secretly opened a cabinet, and the amount of white sugar in a jar decreased. At 2:00 PM on the 5th, she put rice into her mouth. On the 10th, she ate burnt soybeans. At 3:25 PM on the 12th, she ate two pieces each of braised pork and potatoes. At 9:00 AM on the 14th, she ate a piece of grain husk. At 7:45 PM on the 15th, she ate congee, with one grain still remaining on her lower lip. On the 16th, an anal examination revealed coffee-colored matter, the odor of which was the same as feces. At 7:00 PM on the 17th, she secretly urinated once in the bathroom. It was also said that she had returned to Jiulongpo.

[Central News Agency Chongqing 18th Dispatch] The Chongqing Health Bureau formally released a public statement on the 17th regarding Yang Mei's secret eating. The bureau stated that Yang Mei only had research value for being able to endure hunger for 21 days. The examination held by the bureau in May, lasting 21 days, confirmed that Yang Mei did not eat. During this examination period (from the 20th of last month to the present), Yang Mei secretly ate a small amount, which proved that Yang could endure hunger for up to 21 days, and it was deemed that there was no value in actively requesting an examination. Therefore, future work will be determined based on the request of Yang Mei or her guardian. If Yang or her guardian requests an examination, the Health Bureau will propose certain conditions for the examination to proceed. However, it is generally believed that after Yang Mei's secret is exposed, she will soon return to the rural area of Shigui. Furthermore, regarding the consequences of this incident, it is believed that Yang Mei is a rural woman and bears little responsibility, but her guardian knew that Yang Mei needed food to live, and yet deliberately fabricated such a mystification, which is truly unforgivable.

### Murder Case Occurs in Wuxing; Mutual Contract; Night Attack on a Local Tyrant; Six Criminals Arrested

[Our Newspaper Wuxing 17th Dispatch] Yang Dabao, a resident of Ximuwei, Fourth Bao, Yiwu Town, is a well-known local tyrant. This year, due to heavy flooding in the countryside, the fields were submerged. On July 13th, when the farmers of the wei were working together to rescue the situation, Yang Dabao suddenly arrived and forcibly claimed that a farmer named Jiang was not pumping water effectively and demanded a fine of two shi of rice as a warning. Jiang, a barber's assistant, could not afford it and politely asked for an exemption. However, Yang Dabao insisted that his words were like mountains and refused to retract them, which aroused public anger. Eighteen victims initiated a mutual contract, agreeing to share the consequences together. On the night of the 14th, they ambushed and killed Yang Dabao to eliminate the scourge. However, the matter was discovered by the local bao chief, who reported it to the Yiwu Town Office. Soldiers were dispatched to arrest the six murderers, including the monk Seng Pinlian, and they were all transferred to the county government for legal action.

[Our Newspaper Jinan 15th Airmail Dispatch] Facing the current situation, which is far more difficult than at any time in the past, the Shandong authorities, in order to passively provide education, relief, and training to a large number of out-of-school and unemployed youths, and to gather and preserve a strong force for the country, and actively cultivate a large number of basic-level military and political cadres for reconstruction to strengthen the combat system, have recruited and trained 8,000 young soldiers in Shandong, following the "100,000 Youths, 100,000 Soldiers" slogan called for by the head of state during the War of Resistance, and established the Youth Education Corps.

A Grand Gathering in White Horse Mountain

The Youth Education Corps is divided into three regiments, with a total quota of 8,000 people. Except for the Second Regiment, which has not yet started due to the repair of the camp address, the remaining First and Third Regiments, with approximately 5,000 people, officially held the induction ceremony on the 10th at the old site of the former Provincial Cadre Training Corps in White Horse Mountain on the outskirts of Jinan. On the day of the induction ceremony, almost all the leaders from all walks of life in the provincial capital attended. Undoubtedly, in terms of Shandong, this was an unprecedented grand gathering.

5,000 Young Soldiers Take an Oath

At 9:30 AM, the induction ceremony began. The 5,000 young soldiers first read out their oath in the most high-pitched and majestic tone: "Faced with the country's many difficulties, we, based on conscience and sincerity, are willing to use the fire of enthusiasm and the iron of will, under the leadership of the supreme commander, to obey orders, abide by discipline, not fear difficulties, not fear death, create a new revolutionary force, implement the Three Principles of the People, and accomplish the great mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation." Then, Wang Yaowu, also the corps commander, encouraged them with four things: "Set great ambitions, be loving and sincere, don't fear hardship, and don't fear death."

Don't Miss the Time to Rise and Dance at the Rooster's Crow

The most unique aspect, which also won enthusiastic applause from the entire audience, was the poem composed on the spot by Pei Mingyu, Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, to present to them: "Eight thousand disciples rise from Qingqi, Reorganizing rivers and mountains with extraordinary ambition, Vowing to sweep away the evil atmosphere and pacify the national crisis, Willing to rely on their own hands to save the people from disaster. The songs of Yan and Zhao are full of heroes, Generous heroes and heroines from their daughters, Suppressing the rebellion is now the time to test courage, Don't miss the time to rise and dance at the rooster's crow."

Then, Lu Ziren, Speaker of the Jinan Municipal Assembly, gave a speech, calling the young soldiers "people of lofty ideals" and urging them to maintain and promote the traditional spirit of the Whampoa Military Academy, remove the obstacles to the Three Principles of the People, and stabilize people's livelihoods. Finally, a representative of the young soldiers delivered a reply. After the ceremony, all the guests and young soldiers sat on the ground and shared a large pot of vegetables.

The Valiant Soldiers Sing the Corps Song at the Top of Their Lungs

The 5,000 valiant soldiers then marched into the city, parading for a week. The corps song was also deeply embedded in the hearts of the 700,000 citizens of Jinan. In particular, the following few sentences cannot be forgotten: "Look, war is raging, and the victims are everywhere. Parents, wives, and children are displaced and scattered. It is a catastrophe for humanity, it is the riot of traitors and bandits, making the world lose its paradise of happiness." "Mount Tai is in anger, the Yellow River is calling, urging us youths to shoulder the heavy responsibility of the times. We are youths, we are heroes. We ignite the fire of anger in our hearts, hold high the torches, and drive away the evil atmosphere. Strive forward!"

### General Prices: Strong Expectations of Rising Prices; The Future is Truly Alarming

The general prices last week, at the beginning of the week, opened flat. Due to the excessive rise at the end of the previous week and the announcement by the authorities that they would sell large quantities of goods to tighten credit, people were cautious and sellers offered to sell. For example, cotton yarn fell back by about 10%. In the middle of the week, due to tight credit, high black market interest rates, and mixed ups and downs, the trend was relatively stable. From Friday onwards, due to the authorities' announcement of the cost of living index for the first half of July, which was 1.38 million times for workers and 1.07 million times for police officers, coupled with rumors of issuing large denominations of currency, prices rose again. The overall wholesale price index for the past week was 3,637,135 times, up 34.18% from the previous week, breaking through the 3 million times mark. Looking ahead, it is truly alarming. The credit situation last week, judging from the exchange situation of the Central Bank, was not too tight, but black market interest rates once reached over 70%, which shows the weakness of everyone's confidence in legal tender and the strong expectations of rising prices.

Due to the depletion of cash chips, the Central Bank previously stipulated that each bank could receive cash amounts of 4 billion yuan, 10 billion yuan, and 20 billion yuan per day. Last week, due to the announcement of the mid-month index and the arrival of the payroll period, the need for cash was particularly urgent. However, the authorities repeatedly denied the issuance of large denominations of currency for fear of stimulating price increases, which caused great inconvenience to the market. In recent days, there has been an abnormally high phenomenon of remittance rates in various places, which is undoubtedly related to the lack of cash chips. As a result of inflation, the amount of chips naturally increases dramatically. The authorities cannot come up with more countermeasures from the root cause, and this method of picking up the scraps and chasing after the end is indeed in need of correction.

Regarding the national general budget case for the second half of this year, President Weng submitted it to the Legislative Yuan for discussion on the 2nd of this month. According to the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan: "The main points of the general budget: (1) Ordinary budgets can be offset by tax revenues and may have a surplus. (2) Special budgets can be offset by selling various materials and other methods, and no more currency issuance may be added in the second half of the year."

It is also learned that: The national general budget for the second half of the 37th year includes ordinary budget expenditures of over 320 trillion yuan and special budget expenditures of over 590 trillion yuan. The general budget also states that ordinary expenditures are offset by tax revenues and have a surplus; special budgets are offset by selling state-owned assets, materials, compulsory borrowing, and debt income, and no more banknotes may be issued. The case was first reviewed in groups by the Budget Committee of the Legislative Yuan and then comprehensively reviewed on the 14th. According to the Legislative Yuan's news team, the income part was generally increased and the expenditure part was reduced.

The first major thing that the constitutional government should be responsible for to the people is the budget issue. However, this time the Legislative Yuan's review of the budget was always conducted in a "secret" meeting, which seems no different from the style before the constitution. The people, as the masters of the house, do not know the details. We not only feel regret, but we should also awaken the people to pay more attention, form a trend, and urge the government to publicize the budget, because an unbalanced budget is the source of all current economic ills and cannot be ignored in the slightest.

In addition, in the midst of the budget review, we feel that the government still has many areas in which it should do but has not done in terms of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. For example, the recently established Suppression of Rebellion and National Construction Committee is said to have as many as 900 to thousands of members, all with senior-level treatment. For such measures, the state's expenditure of huge amounts of public funds is truly in need of discussion. We would like to awaken the authorities that today's price index is more than 3 million times higher, and countless people are sacrificing under high prices. The government must not waste any of it.

The general price trend in the commodity market last week was that, due to the high level at the end of the previous week and tighter credit, it hovered in a tired state at the beginning and in the middle of the week. Since Friday, the Central Bank's exchange difference has been as high as 1.3 trillion, credit has loosened, the news is positive, and buying sentiment is strong. All goods have rebounded in unison, close to the original level at the end of the previous week, but few new prices have appeared.

The wholesale price index classified by use last week is as follows:

The wholesale price index classified by degree of processing last week is as follows:

The wholesale price index classified by country of production and sales last week is as follows:

### Currency and Finance: Tight Monetary Conditions Once Prevailed, with Widespread High Interest Rates in the Black Market

Last week, although the city's monetary conditions were extremely tight for a period, it lasted only two or three days before easing again. The reason for the temporary tightening was indeed the impact of the authorities selling off goods and the substantial deficit of national banks and bureaus. However, it is reported that the suppression of remittances from various locations on Tuesday also contributed. Nevertheless, this method of building dams and cutting off the flow cannot be sustained, so by Friday, the easing of monetary conditions had become a widespread trend.

Another phenomenon last week was the continued shortage of cash. This was naturally stimulated by the sharp rise in prices, which made the amount of cash available seem insufficient. However, with the high internal exchange rates, it became profitable to transport cash because of the significant losses incurred when remitting funds to other ports. This was also one of the main reasons for the shortage of cash in the city. The scarcity of cash led to the emergence of discounts on the market. Consequently, the increased issuance of promissory notes and traveler's checks further exacerbated the degree and severity of inflation.

Last week, the prevailing black market interest rate was 5.4%, with the lowest being above 4%. In some cases, it even reached 6%. As for the daily interbank lending rate on the market, which amounted to 25 yuan, if calculated as a monthly rate, it was already above 7%, which was unprecedented.

From Monday to Friday, the national banks and bureaus had a total deficit of 138.67 billion. However, this included the transfer of 100 billion from the Central Bank to the Bank of Taiwan on Thursday. Therefore, the actual deficit of the banks and bureaus in five days was only slightly over 380 billion. This also shows that the so-called sale of goods could hardly match the enormous expenditures of the national treasury.

However, the surplus of foreign banks during the week was quite remarkable. From Monday to Friday, the total surplus was 528.89 billion, setting a new record. From this, it is not difficult to see that the flight of capital is still intensifying.

Commercial banks and firms generally experienced uneven positions. Before Thursday, there was a general shortage, so interbank lending was quite active. On Friday, however, positions eased, and lending decreased sharply. After the clearing of accounts by firms after number 60, from Monday to Friday, the total deficit was 643.45 billion. Even after deducting the 100 million in funds transferred by the Bank of Taiwan to the Central Bank, the indirect deficit still reached over 500 billion. Such a high amount was also rare in the past.

Internal and External Exchange Rates

Last week, the city's internal exchange rates generally remained high. The exchange rate for Guangzhou was 450 yuan from Monday to Thursday, slightly dropping to 400 yuan on Friday. The exchange rate for Xiamen rose repeatedly throughout the week, from 450 yuan on Monday to 500 yuan on Tuesday, and further to 550 yuan on Friday. This fully indicates the trend of capital flowing south. Even if the funds remitted from the city to South China were discounted by half, it was still considered worthwhile.

The exchange rate for Chongqing was 200 yuan before Thursday, slightly decreasing to 160 yuan on Friday. The exchange rate for Hankou rose from 400 yuan on Monday to 450 yuan on Tuesday, then dropped to 300 yuan on Friday. Another significance of the high exchange rates is that the prices in the city are higher than in other ports, which may lead to the reverse flow of goods into the metropolis. Last week, the exchange rate for Tianjin was at par before Thursday, but returned to a discount of 50 yuan on Friday.

The price of foreign exchange certificates fluctuated significantly last week. It was 3 million on Monday, rising by 250,000 on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then falling back to Monday's level on Thursday and Friday. The exchange rate for Hong Kong remittances had shrunk to a ratio of 100,000 legal tender to one Hong Kong dollar from Monday to Thursday. The market price of US dollars in Hong Kong was approximately 5.45 yuan, while the price of gold per tael rose from 324.75 yuan to 329.50 yuan.

Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets

At the beginning of this week, monetary conditions were still loose. The Chinese stock market was actively sought after, with investors eagerly participating. As a result, as many as 19 stocks rose to the daily limit. Wing On Textile hit a new high of 9,475 yuan, up 860 yuan from the previous week. On Tuesday, due to the authorities' massive sale of goods and the overall tightening of monetary conditions, the deficit of national banks and bureaus reached a huge sum of over 32 billion. The stock market then showed a volatile trend. While Wing On Textile initially reached a new high of 10,350 yuan, and Mei Ya once hit the daily limit of 5,950 yuan, they soon weakened and plummeted. Wing On Textile closed at 9,200 yuan, showing significant fluctuations in one day. Most other smaller stocks fell to the limit. On Wednesday, the strong monetary conditions persisted, and cash was particularly scarce. The stock market experienced a phenomenon of inability to settle transactions, with a general slow decline. As many as nine stocks fell to the limit. Wing On Textile fell to a low of 8,500 yuan, then slightly recovered to close at 9,280 yuan. On Thursday, monetary conditions became even tighter, and many stocks fell to the limit. Wing On Textile, relying on the support of the Cantonese community, barely managed to hold on outside the 90 million mark. On Friday, due to a large influx of speculative funds from other ports, monetary conditions eased again. The stock market, which had been sluggish for several days, showed a comprehensive recovery. Retail buying was active. Wing On Textile, Mei Ya, and Xin He all rose to the limit at the opening. Other stocks also followed suit, with as many as 21 stocks rising to the limit, an increase of 10% to 20% compared to the previous day. Wing On Textile only traded at one price of 10,055 yuan throughout the day.

Foreign stocks did not trade this week.

### Industrial and Commercial Dynamics: Uncoordinated Economic Measures

The authorities' various economic and financial measures often demonstrate extremely uncoordinated steps. While the authorities may remain indifferent to this inconsistency, at most bearing the reputation of being untrustworthy, it represents a significant loss for the industrial and commercial sectors and the general public. Several facts from the past week are listed below:

(1) Regarding the issue of price increases for public utilities, on the 3rd of this month, Governor Yu of the Central Bank announced to the press that the issue of stabilizing the prices of public utilities in Shanghai had been discussed and decided upon, and would be implemented immediately, stating that this was an important step in stabilizing prices. However, on the same day, Mayor Wu had already approved the new prices for water, electricity, and gas for July, with the new prices increasing by an average of 175% compared to the previous month. Public transportation services had also increased their prices by more than 50%.

(2) Regarding the cost of living index and layoffs, although the cost of living index for June announced by the authorities was only half of the average price index for that month, it had already increased by more than 100% compared to the cost of living index for May. This measure can be said to have met the minimum requirements of public sentiment, and the fact that labor-management relations in the city did not completely break down can also be attributed to the continued increase in this index. However, unexpectedly, the authorities themselves plunged into the vortex of labor disputes. On the afternoon of the 7th, the Shanghai Public Transportation Company of the Public Utilities Bureau announced the dismissal of 75 drivers from the 21st class and 127 ticket sellers from the 18th class, causing a major uproar in the transportation sector. All internal and external staff of the company unanimously expressed their sympathy and support, resulting in the non-operation of more than 300 buses on all lines on the 8th, paralyzing half of the city's transportation.

(3) Regarding the issue of preventing the influx of speculative funds from the north into the city, reports indicate that the Shanghai authorities have decided on five measures, the first of which is to control the contraction of currency and credit, which includes four suggestions: first, to suggest that the central government restrict deposits and withdrawals and prohibit commercial banks and firms from handling Shanghai remittances; second, to limit the amount of cash that ordinary people can bring into Shanghai to no more than 200 million yuan. However, in reality, Shanghai remittances from the Northeast and North China have already been opened, and Governor Yu of the Central Bank has also stated that the purpose of opening Shanghai remittances is to allow legitimate industrial and commercial funds to be remitted. Regardless of which theory held before and after is correct or incorrect, it at least indicates that the authorities' decisions are hesitant and inconsistent.

(4) Regarding the allocation of US aid materials and the issue of import handling, the import industry had placed great hope on it. However, it is said that the allocation of US aid materials, such as cotton, tobacco, diesel, gasoline, and other equipment and raw materials, is limited to a few industrial and commercial enterprises and American import merchants, causing great dissatisfaction among the import and export industries, who have protested.

As for the issue of importing US aid materials, as of last month, it is said that only petroleum is handled by petroleum companies. Shen Xirui of the US Aid Utilization Council also stated that because there are many technical issues in transporting US aid materials from the United States or US territories to China, it must be handled by American import merchants. However, Chinese import merchants hope to handle it themselves. If this cannot be achieved, the sacrifice of the rights and interests of domestic industry and commerce will be considerable!

(5) Regarding the issue of whether the import quota for the seventh quarter will be reduced, the city's import industry and industrial and commercial sectors are extremely concerned. In theory, the US aid bilateral agreement has already been signed, and the export foreign exchange settlement figures for June have exceeded US$20 million, setting a record for export foreign exchange settlement this year. Therefore, the import quota should be relaxed, which can indirectly promote the increase in exports. However, it is now reported that the quota for the seventh quarter will not only not increase but will also decrease, which may be a blow to the newly implemented foreign exchange settlement method.

(6) In order to make up for the financial deficit, the authorities are also making every effort to sell state-owned enterprises. It is reported that the government has ordered the Central Bank to organize a syndicate to preside over this matter. It is also estimated that the sale of state-owned industries is worth more than US$500 million. If it can be implemented smoothly, this is certainly a considerable income. However, if the temporary property tax proposed by the Legislative Yuan is implemented, no one will buy state-owned enterprises, and the industrial sector will certainly not want to bear high taxes for purchasing industries. It can be seen that the two measures are also contradictory. In short, the more chaotic the situation, the more uncoordinated the various measures taken by the authorities will be!

### Government Continues Negotiations to Stop Capital Flight to Hong Kong

Issuing Currency by Local Governments is Not Permitted by Law

[Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 18th] The Ministry of Finance has been paying close attention to the issue of capital outflow. Previously, in order to prevent capital flight, it successively established limits on the amount of national currency that could be taken out of the country, with a limit of 5 million yuan per person, and foreign currency limited to 100 US dollars or the equivalent in other foreign currencies. It also prohibited banks and firms in various domestic locations from handling remittances of national currency to Hong Kong and Macau, restricted travelers from carrying foreign currency and securities out of the country, and strictly prohibited black market trading of Hong Kong dollars. Subsequently, in order to thoroughly crack down on capital flight to Hong Kong, it also negotiated a Sino-Hong Kong financial agreement with the Hong Kong government, in order to cooperate in cracking down on the black market for foreign exchange and smuggling in South China. The agreement has already been partially implemented. Currently, in order to further effectively stop capital flight to Hong Kong, negotiations are continuing. As for the figures for capital flight, because it is carried out secretly, it is impossible to accurately calculate. The Ministry of Finance has not heard of the rumor that the Guangdong provincial authorities plan to issue banknotes independently within the province. Without the approval of the Ministry of Finance, provincial-level local governments adopting special monetary systems is not permitted by law.

### Supplementary Measures for Restrictions on Circulating Coupons and Northeast Remittances Announced

The Beiping and Tianjin municipal governments will immediately stop applying for registration. Those who have already registered will still follow the original method until the exchange is completed. (2) The restrictions on the withdrawal of remittances from the Northeast will still be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance. However, in Beiping and Tianjin, the daily limit for the withdrawal of remittances will be 500 numbers.

The current total stockpile of coal at the mines is 468,256 tons.

### NTU Contract Termination Dispute: Wei Yanxi Seeks Mediation

[Our newspaper's Taipei dispatch on the 18th] The dispute over travel expenses for professors whose contracts were terminated by National Taiwan University (NTU) has not yet been resolved. The terminated professors believe that the hiring system is a good traditional practice in China that should not be destroyed, so they insist on a universal payment of travel expenses and four months' salary. The NTU authorities believe that subsidizing travel expenses is out of sympathy, and cannot be universally paid, and the amount should be determined based on need. The two sides are in a stalemate. Chairman Wei has instructed Zheng Bingru, commander of the military management area, to mediate.

### Special Interview with Universities #4: Private Shanghai University

Brief History

Shanghai University was founded six years before the founding of the Republic of China (1906 AD). Originally named Shanghai Baptist Theological Seminary and Baptist University, it was established by American missionaries from the Northern and Southern Baptist Conventions, who raised 120,000 yuan to purchase 165 acres of land on the banks of the Huangpu River to build the school. It was renamed Shanghai University in 1915. In 1927, the board of directors was formally reorganized in accordance with the regulations for private school boards published by the government. In January 1928, Dr. Liu Zhanen was elected as the first Chinese president to carry out the registration procedures. In March 1929, the Ministry of Education approved the registration. In 1931, the College of Commerce in the city center was subsequently established. In 1937, the Battle of Shanghai broke out, and the Yangshupu campus was located in the war zone, so the school hastily moved to the city center and continued classes at the College of Commerce. On April 7, 1938, President Liu Zhanen was assassinated in Shanghai by enemy and puppet forces for his loyal service to the country, becoming the first person in the educational field to sacrifice for the country since the War of Resistance. Afterwards, the school continued to promote school affairs in an extremely difficult and harsh environment, and formed the East China Christian University Association with St. John's University, Soochow University, and other schools, offering joint courses and libraries, and holding joint graduation ceremonies, demonstrating the unique spirit of Christianity with harmony and mutual assistance. In the winter of 1941, the Pacific War broke out, and the enemy and puppet forces occupied the entire city of Shanghai. Due to the unchanged environment, the school had no choice but to announce its closure. In order to maintain the school's long-standing excellent faculty and students' studies, the alumni association took over and changed it to Shanghai College. At the same time, the American founders and alumni association in Chongqing planned to move the school westward and re-establish it in Chongqing. In February of the following year, they finally succeeded. Initially, it was combined with Soochow University to form the Soochow Shanghai University College of Law and Commerce, and later, Zhejiang University joined, forming the College of Law, Commerce, and Engineering. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945, Shanghai University immediately resumed its operations in Shanghai, and in mid-April 1946, it moved back to the Yangshupu campus to hold classes.

Present Situation

The current president of the school is Ling Xianyang. The colleges and departments and their heads are as follows: Yu Rixuan, Dean of the College of Arts and concurrently Chairman of the Department of Political Science; Wang Zhixin, Chairman of the Department of Chinese Literature; Wcstbrook, Chairman of the Department of Foreign Languages; Fang Tongyuan, Chairman of the Department of Education; Shi Chunjiang, Chairman of the Department of Sociology; Zhu Qidong, Chairman of the Department of Music. Zheng Zhangcheng, Dean of the College of Science and concurrently Chairman of the Department of Biology (Pre-medical and Nursing program attached to Biology); Tang Ningkang, Chairman of the Department of Chemistry (Industrial Chemistry attached); Ren Lang, Chairman of the Department of Physics (Electrical Engineering attached). Zheng Shicha, Dean of the College of Commerce and concurrently Chairman of the Department of International Trade; Ling Xianyang, Chairman of the Department of Business Administration; Chen Deheng, Chairman of the Department of Accounting; Zheng Hui, Chairman of the Department of Banking.

Admissions

This fall, the school will recruit freshmen for all departments in Shanghai and Guangzhou. There will be two admissions in Shanghai. The first exam period has passed. The registration date for the second admission is August 16 to 18, and the exam date is August 20 to 21. The registration location is on the second floor of No. 20, Huchiu Road (Museum Road), and the examination hall is at the school on Jungong Road, Yangshupu. The exam period for Guangzhou admissions is July 16 to 17, the same as the first time in Shanghai. The location and examination hall are at Pui Ching Middle School, Peizheng Road, Dongshan, Guangzhou.

[Additional News] The College of Commerce of Shanghai University in the city center has now been changed to the school's commuter department.

It was originally named Aurora College, with preparatory and undergraduate departments of arts and sciences. The school was located at the old Xujiahui Observatory. In the 34th year of Guangxu, it moved to the current site on Lupan Road. In the 3rd year of Xuantong, departments of medicine and law and political science were added.

It is said that Weng Wenhao, Yu Bin, and Hong Lanyou were also early graduates of the school.

Present Situation

The school is located at two sites, Chongqing South Road (formerly Lupan Road) and Changle Road (formerly Pushi Road).

The architecture is magnificent, and the environment is clean. There are currently 149 faculty and staff members, many of whom are authoritative scholars from China and abroad. The total number of students in the university headquarters last semester was 1,339. The school has always encouraged students' extracurricular activities. Previously, during the war, it organized wounded soldier hospitals, refugee service groups, traveling rescue teams, free education parks, lecture groups, sports associations, and so on. In recent years, due to the unstable environment and student groups, it has temporarily limited itself to academic exchanges, fellowship, and sports.

### Olympic Torch Advances Under Tight Security by Greek Army: Ambushed by Greek Guerrillas in Katakolon Port

[Athens, July 17, report from the agency] The Olympic torch was carried by runners today, starting from Olympia village in Greece, to begin the first leg of the 2,000-mile journey. Because several foreign journalists and officers of a Greek destroyer were attacked by guerrillas in Katakolon Port on the way to Olympia village to watch the lighting of the torch today, the route of the torch is under tight security by the Greek army. A guerrilla broadcast announced that General Markos had ordered guerrillas to stop the Olympic torch from reaching London. The attack on British and American journalists is probably related to this. Before the start, the first runner was fully armed. After the torch was lit, the runner took off his military uniform, put down his weapons, and dressed in shorts, began to set off as an athlete, holding the torch high. The torch was carried to Katakolon Port, 50 miles from Olympia village, and then transported by a Greek destroyer to Crete, where it was handed over to another runner to be transported to the British destroyer to Bari Port in southern Italy, and then carried forward by Italian runners. It is scheduled to arrive at Wembley Stadium on the afternoon of July 29.

[Reuters Athens, July 17] According to a report from Patras: Foreign journalists and an officer of a Greek destroyer were attacked by Greek guerrillas today while watching the Olympic torch lighting ceremony in Olympia. The guerrillas were later repelled by the Greek army. It is reported that one Greek soldier was killed.

### Jinlan Achieves Undefeated Record in First Round of Group A Tennis: Defeats Lianmei 9-6 Yesterday

Jinlan defeated Lianmei 9-6 yesterday, maintaining an undefeated record in the Group A tennis league. Except for the match postponed due to rain last Thursday, the second round of the competition will begin this Thursday. The current situation is as follows:

In addition to the Jinlan-Lianmei match yesterday, Tiyun defeated the home team Enpai 10-5, and Green Light defeated Youlian 13-2 on the home field.

Both Jinlan and Lianmei had strong lineups, and the competition was very intense. In particular, the defeat of Yu Wenzheng and Cai Guoji's team by Ye Guanhong and Li Guofan's team was the most eye-catching and was appreciated by the audience. Lianmei's strength was greatly affected due to Lin Baohua, Xu Peizhi, and Zhu's absence, especially the failure of the third group, which suffered the most.

The fourth and fifth pairs started the trial first. Unexpectedly, Lianmei could get all six points, but in the third set of the last four groups, Yu Tianguang's "match point" was lost, and the set was lost instead, reducing one point. The same situation occurred in the fifth pair. Lianmei won each with a score of 2-1, and Lianmei scored 4 points and Jinlan scored 2 points. The second pair was a combination of Li Wencheng and Liu Delin, and Tao Guanqiu and Zhou Guanjun scored three points, and the score became 5-4, with Jinlan scoring one more point. The third pair took the stage, and Chen Yi fought hard, but Wu Jingxue was weak and was made an attack point. Jinlan Cai and Wei scored three consecutive sets, and the score became 8-4.

The first pair, Ye and Li, had nothing to offer. Wang and Cai won the second and third sets easily with a score of 6-2. Ye and Li's high kill blocks were quite successful, winning with scores of 6-3 and 6-4, and the total score became 9-6. Cai Guoji's doubles performance was the best, but he made a "foot fault" when serving, and Yu Tianguang's jump should be paid special attention to. The results are as follows:

[Jinlan defeats Lianmei]

(1) Wang Wenzheng Cai Guoji

6-2 3-6 4-6

Ye Guanhong Ji Guofan

(2) Tao Guanqiu Zhou Guanjun

6-0 6-0 6-4

Li Wencheng Liu De

(3) Shi Sun Tang Baojia

### 73 Teams Participate in the Competition: The Third Table Tennis League Opens Tonight: 14 Matches in Groups A, B, and C

The third Shanghai Table Tennis League, organized by the Municipal Sports Association Table Tennis Committee, will be contested by 73 teams, divided into Groups A, B, and C. The first week's order has been arranged and will start at 6:30 pm today (19th) in the nine ballrooms of the Jingwu Main Branch Post Office, etc. All venues will not sell tickets. People from all walks of life are welcome to visit nearby to promote the sport.

There are a total of 14 matches today, including 2 matches in Group A, 4 matches in Group B, and 8 matches in Group C. The players of each team must participate in the competition according to the list of team members in the handbook. If there is any impersonation or unauthorized substitution of players, the qualifications will be immediately revoked upon discovery. The organizers hope that after the competition, the winning team will send the record sheet to Chen Linsheng, Hualian Tongle Club, No. 194 Nanjing East Road, for sorting out in order to publicize the results. The order of the two Group A matches tonight is as follows:

Huamei - Qinglian (Group A) 8 pm Jingfen

Jingwu Huang - Nanhua (Group A) 8 pm Jingzong

Huamei has emerged as a dark horse with strong strength. Xue Xuchu, Fu Qifang, and Li Zongpei, the three swordsmen of the Shanghai Star team, are all key players in the team. Although Qinglian has emerging stars such as Liu Baotai, Ma Gengyao, and Xiao Maojin, they are obviously no match for Huamei. However, these young players will uphold the spirit of perseverance and resist strong teachers in order to gain combat experience, and will not be disgraced even if they lose.

Nanhua is the incarnation of Hualian. Lu Wenliang, Zheng Jiakun, and Zhong Zhihui are all good players from the Hualian team. There is also Cai Xiuyu, the Shanghai women's champion who attended the National Games, participating in the battle. Jingwu Huang is not weak either. Players such as veterans Li Longbiao, Li Peiran, and Liang are all veterans who have fought on the battlefield for a long time. The strength of the two teams is difficult to distinguish, and a fierce battle is inevitable. The following is a record of the order of each match in Groups B and C tonight

### The Story of a Car Salesman

— Lv Man

Casually flipping through a newly arrived American magazine, you can easily find many colorfully printed advertisements, and the most exquisitely designed and widest-ranging are often car advertisements. Ford Motor Company's advertisement often features a Westerner's crystal ball for fortune-telling, and next to the crystal ball is a slogan that says, "You will always buy a Ford car in the future." Really, who doesn't want to buy a beautiful car for transportation?

However, forty years ago, the average American still often held a skeptical attitude towards cars. At that time, the roads were far from as wide and flat as they are today, and the cars themselves were not yet manufactured to perfection, so it was common to "break down" in the middle of the road, and it was quite troublesome to repair. Selling cars was really a thankless job.

Therefore, car salesmen used their brains and kept racking their brains to think about sales "gimmicks."

One day, a short advertisement suddenly appeared in a Los Angeles newspaper, saying that "the weather is extremely cold, and half of the oranges in my garden have been frozen and damaged, resulting in huge losses, so I have to reluctantly sell cars at a low price." Enthusiastic and curious people went to the unfortunate person's home to see the cheap car. It just so happened that the car owner had excellent eloquence and described the benefits of the car in glowing terms. As a result, he quickly found a buyer. But did the latecomers leave empty-handed? Not at all. It turned out that when the second buyer who wanted cheap goods came, there was another old car waiting there. As a result, the family sold many old cars and made a lot of money. The car owner was only about twenty years old and had already established himself as a self-made man. He was not lying. There were indeed orange trees in his backyard, but there were only two in total. In this cold snap, one of them was indeed frozen and damaged.

Slowly, the young car broker officially became the branch manager of a local car company, and he enthusiastically promoted various new cars. However, most of the local residents still felt that the price was too high, and although they loved them, they were reluctant to take out large stacks of banknotes to buy them. The manager had a flash of inspiration and came up with another trick. He said that he sold cars, but customers did not necessarily have to pay money: customers could exchange things with him. After this method was announced, business immediately flourished, and residents flocked to exchange their diamonds, horses, carriages, real estate, orchards, etc. for new cars. But when the manager sold those diamonds, horses, real estate, etc., the money he got was much higher than the car's price. A small trick not only sold countless cars, but also made a lot of money for himself.

However, even though his powers were vast, he inevitably failed occasionally. One day, a veterinarian came to his store and took a fancy to an old Jackson-brand car. He wanted to test drive the car, but the genius salesman was secretly anxious. It turned out that this "antique car" produced in 1905 was really not able to withstand much "testing"; but for the sake of business, he had no choice but to agree happily and personally drove the car to send the veterinarian home. Unexpectedly, he was blessed by good fortune, and the car arrived safely without breaking down. The veterinarian was overjoyed and sat in his kitchen to prepare to sign the car purchase contract, but he suddenly stopped writing, turned around, and asked a question that was difficult to answer.

He said, "Your car is not bad. But let me ask you a question: If the person buying the car is not me but yourself, do you think this car is worth buying?"

The salesman's heart skipped a beat. He was still young, and he desperately wanted this deal to succeed so that he could earn a commission that he urgently needed. Just as he was hesitating, he looked up and saw a banner with words embroidered on it hanging on the wall. The banner clearly read:

"God is listening to your every word."

As a result: He drove the broken car back—the deal was not successful.

You may want to know the current status of this car salesman, right? Indeed, it is impossible for such a person to end up unknown.

He is Hoffman, the big boss of Studebaker Corporation in the United States. President Truman knew of his abilities, so on April 5 of this year, he entrusted him with a job that concerned the safety of the whole world. Since that day, Hoffman, the chief executive of the European Recovery Program, has become one of the most popular and busiest people in Washington's political circles.

### Recent Poetic Talks

— Shi Damu

In recent times, Yang Yunshi once served as a private secretary to Wu Peifu, naming his residence "Jiangshan Wanli Lou" (Ten Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains Pavilion). His poetry followed the style of Old Du (Du Fu), possessing a certain meaning beyond the words. I once saw his three poems on crickets, and now I record one of them: "Also knowing my late birth, the seasons have already gathered the cicadas, the lamp reflects in the pool pavilion like water, the passes and mountains are filled with clouds. The sound counts as the stars about to dawn, a lonely guest makes the night a year, why is the anxious heart so troubled, who is wiser than you in enduring the levies?"

Longyang talent Yi Shifu was as famous as Fan Fanshan, author of the "Four Souls Poetry Collection," namely Soul East, Soul West, Soul South, and Soul North. Yi was seen as a child prodigy since young, said to be able to compose poetry at seven years old, but his poetic realm is desolate, could it be that poverty leads to skillful writing! Such as the poem "Remaining Summer": "The lingering summer is distressing, rain easily brings autumn, the chirping of crickets is like lingering anger, the cold cicadas rest, the water covered in smoke as the water chestnuts withered, the lonely tree stands tall, and the moon is bright above the pavilion, towards the evening the west wind is urgent, pacing back and forth and singing the four sorrows."

Wang Lixi was from Jiangxi, a famous writer of his time, who once served as the editor-in-chief of "Reading Magazine" at the Shenzhou Guoguang Society, which was very popular for a time. In the early years of the War of Resistance, he unfortunately died on the way representing the National Literary Association to comfort the front-line soldiers. Wang could write poetry, and I saw a poem he casually composed in early autumn: "The years urge me to age, autumn wind is upon me again, I have failed the country in vain, learning to rely on others in poverty! The mountain willows droop and frown, the forest insects enter the ear anew, alas, my seven-foot frame, is but suffering in the wind and dust."

Dr. Liu Bannong excelled at composing limericks, calling himself the master of "Ringtonghua Zhidou Tang" (Ringtonghua Sesame Soybean Hall), which meant that his ringtong flowers, peanuts, sesame, and soybeans could all be used to make oil. Therefore, his works were mostly simple and easy to understand. There is a self-lamenting poem that says: "Sitting and possessing a city of books, I boast, but is the inkstone field and pen array a livelihood, Heaven gave me this Chinese body but it is useless, just like a grain of sand in the Ganges."

Shen Yinmo was skilled in writing quatrains, and his works were clear, elegant, and gentle, quite like Wen Tingyun of the Tang Dynasty, such as "Casual Spring Day": "Green water flows, a boat reflecting the evening glow, the cold plums have fallen and spring is blooming again, the young woman in her boudoir looks from the tower, fearing to see the wind teasing the slanting willows."

Hu Huaichen, originally named Ji　, was a prominent figure in the "Saturday School" back then. Later, seeing his kinsman Hu Shi advocating the New Literature, he also rose up to imitate it, with "Dajiang Ji New Poems" echoing Hu Shi's "A Book of Experiments". He also founded the "Novel Revolutionary Army", but its impact was minimal. In his later years, he taught at Daxia, Chizhi, and other universities, dying in poverty and distress. He worked very diligently on literary history throughout his life, often forgetting to eat and sleep, and once created the theory that Mo Di was an Indian, which caused a public outcry for a time. After his death, many volumes of "Jichen Miscellaneous Poems" remained unprinted. I obtained a poem "Spring Rain": "The mist is hazy and the weather is not clear, the east wind blows the sound of cuckoos, a day of floral rain at the late firewood gate, the three months of fish growing in the spring water, the purple swallows carrying mud dislike the slipperiness, the white clouds coming out of the mountain are also clear, the peach blossoms are originally from the celestial land, falling into the human world with lightness of gain and loss."

Ms. Lu Yin graduated from Beijing Women's Higher Normal School, and her old poems had a solid foundation. She wrote many works in her life, but unfortunately, she scattered and discarded them at will. I have a poem lamenting chrysanthemums, signed Huang Ying. The poem says: "The lingering fragrant soul is seen in dreams, several times my heart breaks at the time of the dawn frost, the yellow withering makes the sadness quick, the chastity that was gathered in those days is regretted, wine cannot pour away sorrow, only crying, the flower cannot laugh in purple, sadly unknowing, originally the forms and appearances have all become illusions, busying the poets to write elegiac poems."

Lin Huiyin was the daughter of Changmin, and married Liang Rengong's son Sicheng as his wife, she was indeed a contemporary female poet. I once saw Lin's quatrain that says: "Hibiscus flowers bloom, a heart-breaking red, secrets, subtle waves gently communicating, wanting to let a small boat go and gather on the river, how many times the sad rain and sad wind." A subtle and beautiful, recitable work.

### "Sleep Gas"

— Tiao Ying

"Summer days are long, good for sleeping." But why do people need to sleep?

Many people have answered this question, but so far, there is much disagreement and no conclusion.

The most wonderful is the late Professor Munila of the French National Academy of Sciences, who said that there is a mysterious gas in the air, called "sleep gas," which makes you want to sleep when you breathe it. He said that "sleep gas" is most abundant in the country air, so it may be produced by plants. He has repeatedly tried to put "sleep gas" in bottles, but unfortunately, he did not succeed.

### Street Corner

— Ji Mo

Almost every day, I have to pass through the crossroads several times, especially in the central area around Jiangxi Road. From about 10 am to 5 pm, that area becomes even more crowded, with pedestrians and vehicles coming and going, a chaotic scene. Each person's eyes have their own direction of walking. Although there are traffic lights to control, pedestrians still take the opportunity to pass through the narrow gaps between vehicles. At that time, their situation of rushing to all sides was not in the form of a "cross", it was simply in the form of an "asterisk"!

Writers like to use "crossroads" to symbolize the hesitation and divergence of the parties involved, but from my perspective as an observer at the crossroads in the central district, the pedestrians and wheels do not hesitate at all when they come and go; on the contrary, they are all very determined, and they are determined to go in the direction they want, even close to stubbornness. A tricycle driving obliquely almost knocked down a teenager riding a bicycle. The teenager hurriedly jumped down, and scolded angrily, but the tricycle was already far away. It seems that those who are hesitating at the "crossroads" are only those daydreamers who only speak lofty words. The practical people do not take it as a matter at all.

### Fragments

— Xian Si

President Truman now has the following means of transportation dedicated to his personal use: (1) the plane "Sacred Semi"; (2) the yacht "Williamsburg"; (3) several specially made cars; (4) a specially made bulletproof train carriage. The train carriage is especially well-made and will not be damaged even if a bomb is thrown at it.

The Nazi books seized by the American military stationed in Germany were not destroyed. The reason is that they have reprocessed the paper of these books into pulp and used it to make new paper for printing textbooks.

Hitler's private yacht was obtained by a British nightclub at auction for $300,000.

The seats on the plane used by King George VI of England all face away from the direction the plane is traveling. It is said that this is safer in case of a forced landing.

### Insect Language

— Shi Shufan

Listening to the clear sounds of cicadas during illness, I roughly understand their meaning and translate it into insect language as follows:

Thirsty, drinking the cool wind, hungry, eating the clear dew, relying on height to look far, the heart is full of worry and fear. No noble, no humble, together facing the 　tomb, 　　my voice, what the common people utter, Heaven listens from below, reflect on yourself, do not be angry!

Not things are the disaster, but human plans are really short, the official shows an example, calculating every penny, climbing step by step, who can control Heaven's will? Blame those merchants, going far from governance day by day, a quick knife to cut silk, courageous in one cut!

Careful planning is essential, clarity is not scrutiny, promote the good and reject the bad, as water flows to the level, the crime deserves death, the reward does not exceed the merit, Wei Yang moved the wood, the order must be carried out, the official is evil, the government fails, expand and purify.

Wildfires knot spring weeds, chaos like grass, why not train the young and strong, the homeland is self-protected, 　its command, relax the levy, living defends the home, plowing does not waste rice, geographical advantage and human harmony, why worry about old teachers?

To fight without teaching, is surely a waste of manpower, forcing them to go to war, also destroys families, if the laws are truly good, the abuses will come out in clusters, then let the traitors, be able to release slippery tongues, driving fish into the abyss, it is unspeakable pain.

A salary to foster honesty, what is it like today? To heal hunger and save from cold, is called greed and harshness, taking from the people, the people's resentment increases more and more, isolated government offices everywhere, reflected in the dangerous waves, changes arise in the elbow and armpit, what if the dike collapses?

The river and sea are the measure, the instrument cannot be narrow, talents emerge from generation to generation, how many factions are there? Seeking a doctor as if thirsty, worshiping when hearing goodness, illness is too great, creating enemies is great, Zhang Yuan's westward journey, is what the past generations warned about!

In youth, spirit is strong, worries and joys are too numerous, easily angered and easily moved, true feelings cannot be controlled, only sincerity can be measured, foolishness is not willing to be played with, forgive those who cross the line, do not wrongly condemn those who are kind, taking ten thousand and receiving one thousand, may exhaust its use!

Recently, Tian Jun came to Ping to handle school affairs, and his conversation with guests was very interesting and alerting. He said: "In the past, teachers managed students, but now students manage teachers." Tian Jun is now in the education authority, but in his early years, he was the one being educated.

According to our generation's education era, small school disturbances were unavoidable, there was no such thing as a student movement, nor was there any organization of self-government associations. Each class elected a class leader, and matters related to public affairs were discussed by the students, and the class leader reported to the authorities. Generally, in a school, apart from the teachers in each class, the most closely related to the students were one being "Educational Affairs" and the other being "Management". The name of the manager might be "Dean of Residence", "Residence Supervisor", and "Supervisor of Studies", which is now "Dean of Students" and "Director of Student Affairs". Because they have the responsibility of guiding, supervising, admonishing students' character, behavior, food, lodging, and hygiene, they are of the same status as the ancient "Guards and Mentors" and "Teachers". Although they do not teach, they are also "teachers", and their nature is different from "General Affairs and Logistics".

In the old days, students occasionally had requests, such as dissatisfaction with textbooks or teachers, which led to conflicts, which mostly concerned educational affairs. The educational affairs office had the principal above, the teachers on the side, and the students below, and each level spent a lot of energy. However, the residence affairs office (or supervisor) followed the rules and did not have any particularly worrying issues. However, in the past twenty or thirty years, it has been exactly the opposite. The school has a student self-government association, and the self-government association resolves to strike. Although the teachers are in class, there is no one, and if they decide to march, the administrators can only stare blankly aside and cannot stop them. If any accidents occur outside the school, or there are conflicts with the local authorities and detentions, then bailing them out, comforting them, etc., they will be too busy to handle. Therefore, the "Dean of Students" of today and the "Supervisor of Studies" of the past differ in ease and hardship by more than can be measured.

The two words "manage" and "teach" have always been connected. The teachers in the old private schools also "taught" and "managed", combining the two in one. Just look at the play "The Peony Pavilion Disturbs the School". Chen Zuiliang, because Miss Du arrived at the school late, first reprimanded the girl for the things that women should wake up early and the things about the discipline of women, which is "Guidance". Then he explained the Book of Songs, first the words, then the great meaning, which is "Teaching". In modern-style schools, there are many people and the organization is tight, so educational affairs and management must be divided. However, the teacher managing the students is still the same. Even in today's primary and secondary schools, it is still the case, especially in primary schools. The dignity of the teacher and the obedience of the students are not much different from the old days, but in specialized schools and universities, the atmosphere has changed dramatically.

I remember in the first year of the Republic of China, Dr. Yan Jidao took office as the president of Peking University, and invited Liang Rengong to give a speech to the entire school in the auditorium. Yan said: Now it is the Republic of China, and the people have freedom, which is recorded in the provisional constitution. However, there are only two types of people who cannot have freedom: one is the army, and the other is the students. The reason is that only because they do not know something and cannot do something, they enter the school to ask the teachers for advice. If they think that what they know and can do is above the teachers and do not obey the rules, then why enter the school? Liang advised them in three points: (1) obedience, (2) tranquility, and (3) opportunity; learning can be successful, and entering the school is not in vain. Are the words of the above two great celebrities now things of the past?
