### Cleveland's Arrival in China: Expected to Fly to Shanghai in Four Days

[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] Cleveland, the head of the China Program Office of the Economic Cooperation Administration, departed for China tonight and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in four days. He is accompanied by Mr. Ssu Tsung-li, Yen Chia-kan, and Lin Wei-chun.

The success of these plants is closely related to the effort to contain the communists in the area. It is extremely important for maintaining non-communist China and the interests of other countries. The destruction of railway and power facilities, in addition to posing difficulties for the military commanders of the North China government, could lead to other more serious situations.

### Editorial: Attracting Overseas Chinese Capital and Production Enterprises

Since the currency reform, one of the positive developments has been the dramatic increase in remittances from overseas Chinese. There are two main reasons for this: one is increased exports, and the other is a reasonable exchange rate, with the latter being the most important. Because the exchange rate was too high, it was too unprofitable for exporters, who were forced to resort to concealment and smuggling, as evidenced by the facts of the past few years.

To prevent a large-scale evasion of these funds, the government promulgated on July 27th of this year eleven articles of measures for overseas Chinese capital and overseas Chinese citizens' funds to invest in domestic production enterprises. The purpose was to open avenues for foreign exchange funds staying abroad or overflowing into other regions to return to the country. However, the conditions were too harsh and the restrictions too strict, placing heavy burdens on overseas Chinese businessmen with remittances, depositors with overseas funds, and importers who commissioned the import of goods. They hesitated and made no progress. For a month, until the economic reform on August 19th, these measures were practically just empty talk and had no effect. This was due to the short time frame, and most parties involved were not yet ready to take action. The designated uses were limited to agriculture, forestry, fisheries, animal husbandry, industry, mining, water conservancy, public utilities, and transportation. The establishment of new enterprises or the expansion of old ones required various conditions. The imported production equipment had to be confirmed as being for the applicant's own use, and the quantity of imported raw materials was limited to no more than six months of production needs. Any violation would result in the applicant or the commissioned importer being permanently banned from receiving raw material allocations and permanently disqualified from applying for any goods. These strict restrictions and penalties were too burdensome and frightening, discouraging any interest in running a business. Why? Those with foreign capital may not have a deep interest in or experience with the aforementioned production enterprises. If an overseas Chinese businessman has accumulated considerable capital, he must have been abroad for a long time and may not be familiar with the economic situation in the country, making it even more difficult for him to return willingly. Therefore, these measures were more accurately described as restricting the inflow of foreign exchange rather than attracting it. The ancient saying "going south by driving the chariot north" aptly describes such measures.

Since the promulgation of the Financial and Economic Emergency Measures Decree, and the simultaneous announcement of Measures for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets of Citizens of the Republic of China Deposited Abroad, the situation is now different. The Measures for Overseas Chinese Capital and Overseas Chinese Citizens' Funds to Invest in Domestic Production Enterprises are reportedly being revised by the relevant authorities. With the Measures for the Registration and Management of Foreign Exchange Assets of Citizens Abroad already providing a framework, the remaining issue is only overseas Chinese capital, which is a narrower scope. The key points are reportedly: (1) how to prove it is overseas Chinese remittance, and (2) when investing in production enterprises, there must be a production plan approved by relevant domestic authorities (see this newspaper's issue of the 28th). The former is intended to prevent abuse by non-overseas Chinese citizens' funds, while the latter is intended to strengthen the restrictions on production enterprises and prevent the inflow of funds into non-production enterprises. Objectively speaking, these can be seen as necessary measures. However, in handling this issue, there are two key points that must be highlighted and brought to the attention of the authorities:

First, whether it is overseas Chinese capital or funds of Chinese citizens abroad, our greatest goal should always be to have it flow back, not to exclude it and allow it to remain abroad. This is a simple and clear reason that does not need further explanation. Therefore, all measures should only guide it, help it, and open doors to attract it, making it easier to flow in, in order to make the most of it. We should not add unnecessary procedures and troubles to obstruct its inward flow. Since the economic reform, the redemption of domestic gold banknotes has been remarkably successful, increasing the country's capital considerably. However, the registration and management of foreign exchange assets abroad has yet to be promoted, indicating that attracting foreign capital is much more difficult than redeeming domestic gold banknotes. Recently, there have been rumors that relevant authorities are considering opening up foreign exchange for personal use to maintain domestic production, mainly allowing the purchase of raw materials or equipment for import without attaching conditions such as establishing a factory for self-use. This is more reasonable and progressive than the regulations for applying to import when investing in domestic production enterprises. We sincerely hope that this idea will be quickly adopted when revising the above measures.

Second, although the so-called "production enterprises" in Article 1 of the aforementioned measures include agricultural product processing, export businesses, and handicrafts, judging from the wording of Articles 2, 3, and 4, the meaning clearly leans towards establishing factories. Factories engage in production, without a doubt. But if no one brings in raw materials and equipment for use, how can factories engaged in production have everything they need and want at will? If the produced goods are not promoted by wholesalers, transporters, and retailers, is the task of production then considered complete? Other industries such as finance and transportation may seem like ordinary commerce and have no direct relationship with production enterprises, but without these industries, can large-scale production enterprises proceed smoothly? Therefore, while guiding overseas Chinese capital to run production enterprises is an attractive slogan, we should interpret the four characters of "production enterprises" in a broad sense, and not rigidly limit it to running factories. Moreover, factories vary in size. If they are all required to handle raw materials, equipment, and even sales themselves, that is simply not feasible. If that were the case, then only the word "factory" is needed, why retain the word "business"?

We believe that foreign capital, whether it belongs to overseas Chinese or is deposited abroad by Chinese citizens, is better guided back for our own use than left abroad for others to use. Many orders are constantly left abroad and cannot be imported because they do not meet the import terms, or have already been imported but are re-exported, remaining in Hong Kong or the Philippines? If these orders are not luxury goods or strictly prohibited items, we also advocate quickly allowing them to be imported with leniency, to enrich the material supply and stabilize people's livelihoods. These matters can no longer be hesitated or delayed. Because material is just another form of capital, and the ultimate use of capital cannot escape exchanging for materials. Therefore, attracting overseas Chinese capital, registering assets, and permitting the import of orders are all the same in effect.

### Seventeen Types of Legal Tender Public Bonds: Early Redemption Starts Today; Registration for Exchange of Consolidated Public Bonds to be Done First; All Deadlines at the End of Next March, Expired Bonds are Void

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] After receiving instructions from the Executive Yuan to promulgate and circulate the Measures for Handling Government Legal Tender Public Bonds and the Measures for Handling Foreign Currency Bonds, the Ministry of Finance immediately instructed the responsible departments to prepare all procedures. Arrangements with the managing banks for handling the early redemption and bond exchange were also completed. It is learned that the ministry announced that it will begin processing the early redemption of Legal Tender Public Bonds and the registration for exchanging foreign currency bonds for new bonds starting October 1st. The early redemption of Legal Tender Public Bonds covers seventeen types. The original measures stipulated that all principal due after August 20th, 1948, will be redeemed early. Interest coupons for the most recent period of each bond that are due after August 20th will be paid at the original interest rate up to September 30th, after which no interest will be calculated. The redemption standard is based on the market price of general Legal Tender Public Bonds on August 19th of this year, and the redemption multiple is determined according to the issuance date of each bond. The corresponding amount of Legal Tender to be repaid is then converted into Gold Yuan at the statutory conversion rate. Bondholders should immediately bring their bond certificates, interest coupons, and seals to the nearest managing bank (any of the four banks: Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, and the Central Trust Bureau) to apply for redemption.

Foreign currency bonds to be exchanged for Consolidated Public Bonds cover four types. All principal due after August 20th, 1948, along with the most recent interest coupon (interest calculated up to September 30th), will be exchanged for Consolidated Public Bonds of the Republic of China for the 37th year [1948]. However, since the Consolidated Public Bonds have not yet been printed, registration procedures will be carried out first. Bondholders should bring their bond certificates, interest coupons, and seals to the nearest managing bank (also the four banks and one bureau) to apply for registration, submit the original foreign currency bonds to the bank, and obtain a temporary receipt. After the bonds are printed, they can be exchanged for bond certificates upon presentation of the receipt.

The deadline for redeeming Legal Tender Public Bonds and registering foreign currency bonds for exchange is the end of next March. Bonds that have not been redeemed or registered for exchange by the deadline will be voided. Furthermore, bond certificates and interest coupons that matured before August 19th, 1948, should be presented by the bondholder to the managing bank for redemption of principal and interest in accordance with the original redemption procedures and are not included in the above-mentioned doubled redemption and exchange for new bonds.

### Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Committee to Hold National Conference Today

Confiscated Foreign-Style Houses in the Capital to be Sold on Schedule

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] The Executive Yuan's Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Committee is scheduled to hold a national enemy and puppet property handling conference at the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 1st. More than 20 heads of enemy and puppet property handling bureaus from various regions have arrived in Nanjing to attend. The main task of the conference is to discuss strengthening the handling of enemy and puppet property, to complete the handling within a very short period of time, and to listen to reports from the heads of various units on the handling of enemy and puppet materials and the difficulties encountered in their work. The conference will be chaired by He Hao-ruo, and Premier Weng will attend to deliver a speech. The conference is scheduled for two days, but will be extended by one day if necessary.

More than 70 other houses are occupied by various agencies and will be handled in the second phase. (2) Original occupants of houses advertised for sale who are unable to purchase them will be ordered to move out within one month.

### Fujian Plans to Mine Longyan Coal Mine and Invites Overseas Chinese to Invest

### Measures for Selling Shares of State-Owned Enterprises to be Improved; Discussion Scheduled for Next Tuesday; Technical Modifications to be Discussed Next Tuesday

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] To study improvements in the techniques for selling shares of state-owned enterprises, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has scheduled a meeting for next Tuesday (the 5th) to invite relevant agencies such as the Resources Committee, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry of Finance to review the sale of shares of state-owned enterprises. Regarding rumors that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to revise the sales measures, Deng Hanliang, Director of the Commercial Affairs Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and Fei Mingyang, Director of the Control Department, both denied this to reporters on the 30th. Since the sale of shares of state-owned enterprises began, the public's enthusiasm for purchasing has not been very high, but the basic methods and principles of the sale will not change. The proportion of total asset value that is sold, aside from what has already been sold, has been allocated to prepare for the issuance of Gold Yuan, making it difficult to change the situation. For example, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company stipulates that 50% will be sold, which is already a significant amount. Selling over 600 million Gold Yuan worth of shares is already difficult. Further increasing the amount will only make it more difficult for the public to purchase. The issuance of shares is entrusted to the Central Bank to be sold by various national banks and bureaus, and this method cannot be changed. Opening up the stock market is currently impossible. However, how to increase the rights enjoyed by the public after purchasing shares will be further discussed when the Ministry of Industry and Commerce convenes a meeting with various agencies next Tuesday.

### Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense Releases "One Week of War Situation": Major Decisive Battle Expected in Central Shandong

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense released "One Week of War Situation" from September 23rd to 29th, stating:

1. Northeast Battlefield

(Liaoxi Campaign) Northeast Front: The bandit forces operating between Suizhong and Xingcheng on the Guandong section of the Beining Railway, which had been repelled by our army on the 19th, have since been reinforced with a large number of bandit troops transferred from southern and northern Liaoning, starting on the 23rd. Currently, the bandit units identified on the Liaoxi battlefield include the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th, 8th, and 9th Columns. In addition, there are also bandit cavalry divisions, the 6th Independent Division, the 8th Independent Division, and artillery units from the 18th Military Sub-district participating in the operations. Starting on the 25th, our Nationalist troops in Jinzhou, in coordination with the air force, launched a proactive offensive north of Jinzhou, engaging in fierce battles for a day and a night, killing and wounding over 10,000 bandits, inflicting a major setback on their forces. The bandit forces and our troops have been engaged in fierce fighting in recent days. In the Jinxi, Xingcheng, and Suizhong area, although bandit units such as the 4th Column, the 6th Independent Division, and the 8th Independent Division have repeatedly harassed the area, our army has calmly confronted them, preventing any major advances by the bandits. On the Yixian front, our troops have fought bravely and tenaciously, and as of the 29th, the bitter battle has lasted for 17 days. Parts of the 3rd, 7th, and 9th bandit Columns have repeatedly clashed with our troops on the outskirts of the city, suffering heavy casualties. Our city defenses remain firm and intact. As for the main bandit forces around Changchun and Siping, they are gradually concentrating in the areas of Xinlitun and Zhangwu, preparing for a major decisive battle.

2. North China Battlefield

The 11th Column of the Li Yunchang bandit forces, which had been harassing the Guannei section of the Beining Railway, and a part of the local bandit military district forces, have been repelled by our army this week. All strongholds along the line have also been successively recovered. The units of the Nie Rongzhen 2nd and 4th bandit Columns, which had invaded the southeastern area of Shunyi, are urgently attempting to flee south for reorganization and replenishment, but are being pursued and suppressed by our main force on the Pinggu Line. They are still wandering around the eastern and western areas of Pinggu. However, the main force of the Nie Rongzhen 1st and 2nd Columns and a part of the 6th Column have been fleeing north to southern Suiyuan from the southwestern area of Datong since the 25th. Our Nationalist troops have concentrated their forces in advance to deploy a counterattack, and have moved the units from Liangcheng and Jining to the flanks of the bandits. On one hand, the local government is leading the people to thoroughly implement a scorched-earth policy. Currently, the bandits are attacking various strongholds between Zhuozishan, Jining, and Guisui. The battle near Guisui began on the 27th. Our troops are fiercely resisting, and the air force has also been mobilized to bomb. The bandits' intrusion into Suiyuan has now officially encountered a counterattack coordinated by our army and the people.

3. East China Battlefield

During the week from the 23rd to the 29th, the East China battlefield showed two different situations. One was that Jinan, isolated on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway on the edge of the Yellow River, was captured by the bandits. The other was that in northern Jiangsu, eastern Henan, and northern Anhui, the main force of the bandits, after being pushed north of the Haizhou Road by the Nationalist army, continued to gather in the central Shandong area, creating a situation in which a major decisive battle is expected to occur soon. Currently, the Chen Yi's bandit troops on both sides of the Jinpu Railway have a total of sixteen column designations, of which five columns suffered heavy losses in the Jinan battle. The remaining bandits in Jixiang, Yutai, and Chengwu in western Shandong have been gradually driven out by the Nationalist army and are retreating towards Jining and Caozhou. Currently, the bandits' 1st, 8th, 10th, and 11th Columns are firmly defending this line with three lines of fortifications, appearing to be preparing to resist step by step.

The Jinan campaign is the prelude to the major battle in central Shandong. Although the bandits occupied Jinan, they had not yet caught their breath when they urgently transferred the 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns, and the 2nd and 12th Columns, which had retreated from northern Jiangsu, to both sides of the Jinpu Railway south of Yanzhou, in order to defend against the advance of our main army and prepare for stubborn resistance. The intention to flee to eastern Henan to disperse our forces. We have thorough plans for the suppression of the Chen and Liu bandit troops and can ensure that the bandits dare not squarely face the eastern Henan battlefield or attempt to escape by chance.

### International Control of Atomic Energy Problem: Political Committee Begins Debate; Canada Asks UN General Assembly to Adopt U.S. Plan; Vishinsky to Present Reply Today

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th Dispatch] The United Nations Political Committee held its first meeting yesterday afternoon, deciding to place the following six items on the agenda first: (1) Report of the Atomic Energy Commission; (2) Soviet disarmament proposal; (3) Palestine issue; (4) Greek issue; (5) Korean issue; (6) Colonial issue. It is expected that it will take six to seven weeks to complete the discussion of these six items. After that, the Political Committee will hold another meeting to decide on other items that need to be discussed.

[United Press, Paris, 30th Dispatch] The UN General Assembly Political Committee met on the 30th to consider two proposals by Soviet representative Vishinsky: "Banning Atomic Bombs" and "Five Great Powers Reduce Armies by One-Third." Canadian atomic energy expert McNaughton said in a speech that only the United States has enough atomic bombs to launch an atomic war. McNaughton also praised the U.S. international atomic energy control plan and said that the Soviet plan has no definite guarantees. He said, "The control stipulated in the Soviet plan only aims to drastically reduce the military strength of the United States, because the United States is the only country that possesses atomic bombs, at least the only country that has enough power to launch an atomic war." He said that he hoped that the UN General Assembly debate could produce a basis for the resumption of negotiations on atomic energy control between the East and West. He then moved to request the UN General Assembly to pass the U.S. atomic energy control plan and urged all member states of the United Nations to accept the U.S. plan as a basis for the development of international control plans. McNaughton said that the public knows that atomic bombs exist in the world, and their power is enough to destroy civilization. He warned that the discovery of new fissile materials, the development of new types of bombs, and other new discoveries in the development process will make future atomic bombs far more devastating than those suffered by Japan. McNaughton's cautious wording did not completely deny the possibility that the Soviet Union also has atomic bombs, but undoubtedly indicated that in terms of quantity and quality, the United States can look down on the world. McNaughton said that the atomic bombs used in Japan were "prototypes," of which only a "small amount" of nuclear power was emitted. He also said that the current efficiency has been "greatly improved," and even said that "the possibilities in this area can be expressed by moving a decimal point." U.S. representative Austin blamed the Soviet Union for the slow progress in atomic control, because the Soviet plan only prohibits atomic energy without stipulating effective international control. "Because the Soviet Union insists on its sovereignty above the safety and survival of the whole, fear has replaced hope. We must work together to bring the discovery of the atom back to life. Only with international guarantees can the application of atomic energy not be used for destruction, and only then can we have long-term security." Austin firmly declared, "The United States is still willing to place its atomic development monopoly under international control with safety guarantees." After Austin's speech, a lengthy procedural debate broke out in the committee. Other committee members were unwilling to speak on the Canadian motion. Chairman Spaak was about to announce the end of the general debate when Vishinsky suddenly objected. He said that the Canadian representative's motion was only circulated on the morning of the 30th, so he did not intend to speak quickly. The meeting was postponed to October 1st, when the Soviet Union is expected to present a reply. According to McNaughton's motion, the UN General Assembly is required to pass the report and recommendations of the Atomic Energy Control Committee, including the U.S. control plan, and "call on all countries to accept the control basis adopted by this committee and assume responsibility for the people of the world." The preamble acknowledges that if the world wants to survive in the atomic age, "there is no other way to go on the atomic issue except for countries to voluntarily share sovereignty."

### The Berlin Incident is a Concern for International Security; the UN General Assembly Faces a Major Test; Dulles Advocates That Major Powers Stop Using the Veto

[U.S. News Agency, Paris, 29th Dispatch] Dulles, Dewey's foreign policy advisor, gave a speech at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace here tonight, stating that there is reason to submit the Berlin issue to the United Nations Security Council, as its purpose is to safeguard peace and justice.

Dulles admitted that it is a major burden for the United Nations to handle the issue caused by the Soviet Union's land blockade of Berlin at this time. He said that the existence of the Berlin issue is a great regret, but since this issue exists and international peace and security are facing a major test, any possible way to seek a solution should not be dismissed without trying. The United Nations is not only an appropriate venue for orderly handling of the situation, but also the only international venue. Regardless of the risky nature of this work for the United Nations, even if these risks do exist, efforts to safeguard peace and justice are paramount. Peace can never be achieved without taking any risks. When discussing the work of the Security Council, Dulles believes that its greatest function is to peacefully resolve disputes, and said that in terms of peacefully resolving disputes, the veto power of major powers should automatically be suspended.

### Japanese Cabinet Embroiled in Corruption Case; Minister of Economic Stabilization Agency, Kurisu, Summoned; Ashida Cabinet May Be Forced to Resign

[United Press, Tokyo, 30th Dispatch] Some Japanese officials here predicted on the 30th that the Ashida Cabinet, which has been in power for seven months, may resign due to one of its cabinet members being involved in Japan's "largest post-war corruption case." Kurisu, the Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board, is heavily suspected in the large-scale corruption case involving the loan from the Japan Reconstruction Bank to Showa Denko, Japan's largest fertilizer manufacturer. The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office is prepared to issue an arrest warrant for Kurisu, but will delay action until after the interrogation.

Kurisu was serving as the President of the Reconstruction Bank at the time of the loan. Other key officials from various ministries of the cabinet who have been arrested in this case have reached 25 people. A cabinet spokesperson strongly denied rumors that the cabinet is considering resignation. He said: The cabinet has "absolute trust" in Kurisu.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 30th Dispatch] Japanese Prime Minister Ashida summoned Minister of Justice Suzuki and held a meeting with Tomibechi on the 30th due to Kurisu being summoned. After the meeting, he made a statement saying: "After listening to President Suzuki's report, since Kurisu is being summoned and not arrested, the cabinet does not need to immediately express its attitude, and there is no need to convene a cabinet meeting on the 30th. We will observe the development of the situation and then decide on the government's actions. Therefore, the issue of Kurisu's successor as Minister of State does not need to be resolved in advance."

[Another Dispatch] The Director of the Social Democratic Party's Diet Policy Committee, Yonekubo, spoke about the Social Democratic Party's attitude on the Kurisu being summoned issue on the 30th, saying: "If Kurisu is prosecuted, the Liberal Party will submit a motion of no confidence in the cabinet. Our party is a friendly party of the government and cannot coordinate with the Liberal Party." He also said that Kurisu will resign after being prosecuted, and the cabinet does not need to bear joint responsibility. However, if the incident develops further and the reason lies in the actions of the Ashida cabinet, our party may demand the resignation of the entire cabinet, not just Kurisu's personal resignation.

[United Press, Seoul, 30th Dispatch] According to an unofficial translation of the speech given by Republic of Korea President Syngman Rhee to the National Assembly on the 30th, Rhee emphasized the need to build a Korean defense army to defend this new republic. Rhee said: The government will implement a military service system and organize an "elite national defense army." He said: "The scale of the national defense army will be kept small, and it will be used to pay for crises during peacetime and protect our national policy."

He also said: The Korean government, in close cooperation with the United States, will strive for the friendship of "many countries" and assume Korea's international obligations. Rhee said: Korea's basic national policy is to "create a democratic country that is capable of maintaining the welfare of the people and maintaining national prestige, and pass it on to future generations without end. The Republic of Korea is a completely sovereign and necessary country and will never reward the privileges of individuals or groups." He also announced the establishment of a "National Defense Bureau" as part of the administrative plan. Rhee said that the Republic of Korea, in accordance with the obligations of the Allied countries, "has obtained the support of most Allied countries" and established "a country that is deeply believed to advocate justice and peace, and our country must be recognized according to the example of China, the United States, and the Philippines." He hopes that Korea can join the United Nations, request to participate in the peace treaty with Japan, and reserve the right to demand "legal" compensation from Japan.

### Indonesian Army Division Mutinies; Has Joined the Communist Army

Rumors that the Netherlands has Sent Troops to Aid Indonesia

[United Press, Batavia, 30th Dispatch] Yogyakarta Radio admitted on the 30th that a part of the Indonesian 4th Division of Yogyakarta suddenly mutinied. According to reports, it has entered the communist camp and is advancing towards Surakarta, 35 miles north of the rebel base of Madiun. The broadcast Zhu explained the strength of the mutinying troops. Surakarta is located 50 miles east of the rebel-occupied Pwerda area and is home to the Royal Dutch Shell oil refinery and Standard Oil Company property. The Indonesian official Antara News Agency reported that 100 rebels attacked an army barracks in Madiun, 25 miles from Yogyakarta. It also said that there was a brief artillery battle between the two sides and the rebels were repelled. There were no casualties on either side.

### Personnel Changes in the Soviet Government: Strengthening Organization to Advance Plans

[United Press, London, 29th] Before departing for vacation from Moscow, Stalin reorganized the Soviet government to strengthen its organization in preparation for the harsh winter. This can be seen in the gradual replacement of key Soviet government personnel over the past month, but the slow pace made it difficult for outsiders to notice immediately. The most significant change is likely the reorganization of the Ministry of Railways, with Stalin replacing Kovalev with Beshchev as the Minister and appointing four new Deputy Ministers, indicating dissatisfaction with the Ministry's performance. However, these railway personnel changes are not enough to alarm Soviet political experts, as it is widely known that railways are a crucial part of the Five-Year Plan. Furthermore, due to the increasingly tense international situation, Stalin intends to streamline the railways. Another important event is the appointment of Krutikov as a Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Central Government. This inner cabinet, composed of several Deputy Chairmen, is each responsible for a specific political or economic function, coordinating the work of the permanent ministers, such as Andreyev's oversight of agriculture, Kosygin's responsibility for finance, and Beria's exclusive control over atomic research. Krutikov was originally the Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade, so he will likely oversee foreign trade, but as Foreign Trade Minister Zhukovsky is also a Deputy Chairman, the division of powers between the two remains questionable.

### More Suspects Arrested in Fuel Management Committee Corruption Case: Sun Jice and Others Transferred to Court, Two Coal Merchants Still Detained at Police Station

[Our Own Report] There has been a major development in the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee's coal transportation corruption case. The Police Bureau's Special Criminal Court, acting on a secret order from the Municipal Government the day before yesterday, arrested suspects related to the case: Sun Jice (former head of the Fuel Management Committee's Distribution Department), the current head of the Coal Adjustment and Supply Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; Section Chief Lin Keying; Section Members Miao Shouzhu; Dai Weihua; Clerks Xu Baoguang; Ren Hui and coal merchants Sun Zhigang and Han Chengpu. The suspects were interrogated by Liu Fangxiong, Director of the Municipal Government's Investigation Office, together with Ying Zhichun, Section Chief of the Special Criminal Court's Third Section, until 11 PM. Due to strong suspicion, they were detained. Yesterday afternoon at 3:40 PM, Lin Keying and the other six were transferred to the District Court. The remaining two coal merchants were still under investigation, and an application has been made to extend their detention for seven days.

Sun and the others were sent to the District Court yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, where Judge Shen Tianbao opened the trial. Sun Jice and Lin Keying completely denied the accusation that they colluded with the Jiangzhe Shipping Company during their tenure at the Fuel Management Committee, obtaining 475 tons of coal per month from the Committee and selling it at black market prices for huge profits. Sun also stated that he was a member of the Youth Party and currently the head of the Municipal Coal Adjustment and Supply Office. As the office had just been established the morning before, and internal personnel had not yet been appointed, the office's operations were suspended after his arrest the night before, which greatly affected the city's coal distribution work. He and Lin jointly requested bail. Subsequently, Miao Shouzhu, Dai Weihua, Xu Baoguang, and Ren Hui successively stated that they all denied receiving the 42 million yuan check from Zhou Jidao. Each of the four had financial dealings with Zhou, either lending money for profit or borrowing money from him for temporary use, but there was absolutely no transfer of money for bribes. As for whether the loans to Zhou had been settled or not, there were no records. When asked by the court whether Zhou's loans to them were a disguised form of bribery, they all vehemently denied it, saying that they often borrowed from him because Zhou's financial situation was better. All subsequently requested bail. The court considered this to be a major corruption case involving a wide range of people. The police bureau had not yet transferred the entire file to the court, so the request for bail was denied. The court adjourned at 5:00 PM.

### Dying Struggle, Frantic Screams and Curses: Mastermind of Plot to Sabotage Power Plant, Wang Xiaohe, Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday

[Our Own Report] Wang Xiaohe, the mastermind behind the plot to sabotage the Shanghai Power Company's machinery, was executed by firing squad at the Special Criminal Court yesterday.

Wang Xiaohe was an employee of the Shanghai Power Company and a standing director of the Power Workers' Union. He attempted to sabotage the power company by instigating Wu Guozhen and others to mix iron filings into the machinery's axles, attempting to cause the machines to explode and create a world of darkness in order to achieve the purpose of disrupting public order. After the incident, he was arrested by the Garrison Headquarters. The Special Criminal Court sentenced him to death. On the 24th of this month, the Central Special Criminal Court upheld the death sentence upon review. Yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, the Special Criminal Court took the accused Wang from the Longchang Road Detention Center for execution. Wang was 25 years old, physically strong, with disheveled hair, wearing an old striped shirt, blue work trousers, and black cloth shoes. His attitude was extremely stubborn, and his hands were handcuffed behind his back. At 9:15 AM, Prosecutor Zhu Cheng took his seat and brought Wang to the case, verifying his identity and informing him that he was ordered to be executed today. When asked if he had any last words, Wang stated three points in court: (1) The Social Affairs Bureau used this means to seize the Power Workers' Union; (2) The Garrison Department extracted a confession through torture; (3) The Special Criminal Court did not allow defense lawyers to appear in court, conducting a secret trial. He also shouted: "Dying unjustly, the Special Criminal Court is murdering people!" When asked by the court if he had any last words for his family, he said that he wanted to see his family and would not write a will. He was urged to drink alcohol to reduce his pain, but he only took a sip, saying that he did not know how to drink. At this point, Prosecutor Zhu ordered the accused Wang to be taken to the execution ground. On the way from the court to the execution ground, Wang continued to scream and curse incessantly. During the execution, because Wang's body kept swaying from side to side, he was tied to a chair. Ye Yaopeng, the squad leader of the Second Squadron of the Security Police's Machine Gun Corps, executed him. One bullet entered from the back of his head and exited from his left cheek. After being untied, he fell to the ground, still moving his mouth and heart. Two more shots were fired to finish him off. It was exactly 10:30 AM.

Three Points of Appeal, Rejection Upon Review

Also, the Central Special Criminal Court's review document, regarding Wang Xiaohe's part, in addition to detailing Wang's instigation to conspire to sabotage the motor, also responded to the three main points of the appellant's review application, namely: (1) Failure to notify his appointed defense attorney to appear in court to defend him, and a secret trial, was a clear violation of the law. (2) The confession and statements made by the applicant at the Garrison Brigade were all extracted through torture. (3) Placing coarse iron layers in the motor axles would never cause an explosion and would not result in a criminal outcome. According to the law, his sentence should be reduced or waived. The arguments were rejected separately. The original text stated: "This court finds that for crimes violating the National Emergency Criminal Law During the Suppression of Rebellion Period, the trial of the case, according to Article 10 of the same law, may only allow defense personnel to appear in court to defend, and does not adopt mandatory defense. The original trial did not approve the defense attorney selected by the applicant to appear in court to defend him, and therefore did not violate the law.

Social Affairs Bureau Proves That Torture Was Not Used

(2) The court found that when the Garrison Brigade interrogated this case, it was handled jointly with Fan Cai Kui, a specialist from the Social Affairs Bureau. According to the specialist's in-court testimony in the original trial, they cooperated in the interrogation and confirmed that torture was not used. (3) According to engineer Wang Feiyun's testimony in the original trial: "Coarse iron filings are not easy to penetrate. If they are fine filings, they may explode immediately. If the time is slightly longer, the coarse iron filings can turn into fine iron filings, and an explosion is certain." Therefore, the applicant's claim that placing coarse iron filings would not result in a criminal outcome is obviously insufficient. The applicant's claims are all untenable." The conclusion stated that "Wang Xiaohe instructed Zhang Shibao to supply iron filings and handed them over to Wu Guozhen to put them into the motor axles. Inquiring into his intentions, he believed that when the current stopped and Shanghai became dark, chaos would occur, thereby supporting the Communist bandits and overthrowing the government. His heart is punishable, and his situation is absolutely unforgivable."

The drivers, cargo escorts, and Gan Xiaochang, the person in charge of the Zhongnan Transportation Company, were all summoned by the Municipal Police Bureau yesterday. According to Gan's confession, the items loaded on the two trucks were all consigned by various scattered households in Kunshan. All five were released on bail pending trial. As for the loaded cotton cloth and sugar, which are all on the list of prohibited goods, they were ordered to sign a pledge for safekeeping and will be dealt with according to the law. The cigarettes, fruit, and other items, which are not on the list of prohibited goods, will be returned.

### Public Utilities Demand That All Coal Prices Remain the Same

Representatives Sent to Petition in Beijing Yesterday

[Our Own Report] It is reported that public utility companies from all over the country, due to the Executive Yuan's promulgation that the price of coal used by public utilities will be charged at the old price before "August 19th" for up to 70%, and the new price for the remaining 30%, felt unable to bear the losses. Therefore, they sent multiple representatives to Beijing yesterday morning to petition the relevant authorities to maintain the "August 19th" allocated price for all coal.

### Municipal Government Employees' Welfare Society Distributes Woolen Cloth

After the Municipal Government Employees' First Welfare Society reopened its stores, purchases were extremely enthusiastic. As it is now late autumn, and Municipal Government employees urgently need to purchase winter clothes, the Society specially negotiated with China Textile to allocate woolen cloth, and registration has already begun. In the future, if confiscated materials are sold off, the Society will also distribute them as much as possible to promote the welfare of colleagues.

### October Rice Prices to Remain the Same; Rice Ration Coupons Will Be Distributed Starting Today

[Our Own Report] Regarding the rice price for October, the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee received a telegram from the Central Government yesterday, deciding to maintain the original price from September, that is, 3.2 million Legal Tender per dou for whole rice and 1.6 million Legal Tender per dou for broken rice. The rice ration coupons for October are now ready by the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee and can be distributed to the district offices starting today. It is expected that citizens in each district will be able to receive the rice ration coupons before the 5th of this month.

Furthermore, according to the person in charge of the Allocation Department of the People's Livelihood Investigation Committee, the rice shipped from the United States stipulates that broken rice must account for one-third. However, the sales of broken rice have been poor in recent months. Prolonged accumulation is not a good policy, so the authorities will change their methods to sell this batch of broken rice.

### Automotive Gasoline Conservation: Implemented Starting Today

[Our Own Report] Regarding the strict implementation of automotive gasoline conservation in the city, the deliberation committee resolved on three plans, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. Now, in order to cooperate with the Central Government's method of reducing the city's gasoline quota, the Municipal Government has revised the temporary measures according to the third plan through the deliberation committee and has ordered the Shanghai Gasoline Allocation Committee and the Public Utilities Bureau to implement them separately starting today. The temporary measures are recorded below:

Temporary Measures

(1) A. Public buses and long-distance buses; B. Automobiles that maintain municipal administration and public service; C. Automobiles that enjoy diplomatic privileges; D. Cargo trucks and taxis with formal licenses will not be reduced. However, if cargo trucks and taxis use or dispose of allocated gasoline for improper purposes, once discovered, their license plates and oil purchase permits will be revoked, and in serious cases, their licenses will also be revoked. (2) Except for the above-mentioned vehicles, the remaining vehicles will conserve gasoline by referring to the principle of reducing automobiles by "four-to-one" or "two-to-one."

The Director of the Public Utilities Bureau has issued a statement saying that if there are illegal speculators who take the opportunity to sell gasoline on the black market, or automobiles that only obtain the basic oil allocation secretly rely on the black market, once discovered, the vehicle licenses will be revoked for both those selling on the black market and those buying from the black market, and severe penalties will be imposed.

### Authorities Decide to Launch General Inventory Check: Inspect One Type of Material in the Same Period to Prevent Concealment and Evasion of Materials

[Our Own Report] Jiang Jingguo convened the ninth economic inspection meeting at the Central Bank conference room yesterday morning at 11:00 AM. The committee members present included Zhang Shi, Cheng Yikuan, Lin Chongyong, and Yu Jiyu. It was resolved at the meeting that to promote future economic management work, it is first necessary to conduct a survey and statistics on daily necessities. Therefore, it was decided to launch a general inventory check within days, inspecting the same type of materials in the same period to prevent concealment and evasion. This task is scheduled to be completed within three days. In order to prevent disturbing the people, unified inspection regulations will be established, and inspection personnel will be issued badges for identification. Supervisor Jiang solemnly stated at the meeting yesterday that the Central Government has decided to overcome all difficulties and implement established policies. At the same time, it is planned to coordinate all regions of the country to stabilize prices. Over the past month, the work of stabilizing prices has had a considerable foundation, and there is still much work to be done in the future. He hopes that colleagues will intensify their work. Furthermore, the enthusiasm for exchanging gold certificates this time is enough to show the people's faith in the government, which he is deeply moved by. However, most major households have not yet fully exchanged all of their gold, silver, and foreign currency, which requires us to continue to work hard to enable them to contribute all of their possessions to the country.

### Trial of Dagong Bank Case Opens: Manager Claims Deafness and Denies Responsibility to the Outside World

[Our Own Report] The case of Dai Chunfeng, former manager of Dagong Commercial Savings Bank, and Ma Jiaxin, assistant manager, being accused of violating the Banking Law, opened in the District Court yesterday afternoon. Dai Chunfeng, due to his deafness, prepared a written defense at the opening of the trial, stating: "There is a general manager above who has overall responsibility for all bank affairs, and an assistant manager below who is responsible for management. Because the defendant suffers from deafness, he is not responsible to the outside world and has not violated the Banking Law." Ma Jiaxin also denied the matter in his subsequent confession. The court ordered a postponement for retrial, and both defendants were released on bail pending trial.

### Administrative Fee Changes to Gold Yuan, Implemented in this City Today

Company Licenses Increase Thirty Thousand Times

[Report from Our Newspaper] Due to currency reform, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in accordance with the supplementary measures for organizing finance promulgated by the Executive Yuan, revised various administrative fees and collected them in Gold Yuan (9) (see the detailed table on page 5 of yesterday's newspaper). The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has received an order from the Ministry to adjust various industrial and commercial registrations, licenses, registration, and other fees from today, according to the new standards set by the Ministry. The new standards are tens of thousands of times higher than before. For example, the company license fee was originally only 500 legal tender, but now it has increased to 5 Gold Yuan, an increase of 30,000 times. The commercial establishment registration certificate fee was originally only 500 legal tender, but now it has increased to 2 Gold Yuan, an increase of 12,000 times.

### Assisting the Government in Implementing Financial and Economic Measures, Realizing the People's Livelihood-Based Social Movement, Wang Sheng Reiterates the Mission of the Suppression and Reconstruction Corps and the Youth Service Corps While Hosting News Reporters

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Chiang Ching-kuo's cadres in the Suppression and Reconstruction Corps, like Chiang Ching-kuo himself, seem to be regarded as legendary "heroes" in the minds of many Shanghai people today. In fact, Supervisor Chiang is just an ordinary public servant with courage and a sense of justice, and his cadres in the Suppression and Reconstruction Corps are also an ordinary team working for the people with justice. Their activities certainly make unscrupulous merchants tremble and powerful families lose their courage, but they are not three-headed, six-armed, or murderous characters.

It has only been a little over a year since the establishment of the Suppression and Reconstruction Corps. In the early part of the 36th year of the Republic (1947), the authorities deeply felt that the military and civilians in the various pacification zones were disconnected, the Baojia system was corrupt, and spies were rampant. They felt it was necessary to cultivate a group of new talents to assist in the basic-level administration in areas close to the war zone. Therefore, the President issued a handwritten instruction to open a Suppression and Reconstruction Class under the Central Training Corps and established a training committee to supervise the matter. Zhang Lisheng was appointed as the director, and Chiang Ching-kuo was the deputy director. Hu Gui, a graduate of the third term of Whampoa Military Academy and deputy director of education at Chiang's intelligence (two) regiment, was responsible for the actual training tasks. He is now the commander of the Suppression and Reconstruction Corps.

Does Not Directly Inspect or Arrest People

The Sixth Brigade, originally in Tangshan, has been transferred to Shanghai for more than a month, but the public's understanding of the nature and mission of the team is still very vague. Some people even think that they are special figures who can say anything. For this reason, Brigade Commander Wang Sheng specially hosted the press yesterday. He solemnly stated again that the mission of the Suppression and Reconstruction Corps is very simple, that is, to "mobilize the people, assist the government, and implement the emergency measures for finance and economy." The Suppression and Reconstruction Corps itself is not a government office and is absolutely not responsible for directly carrying out inspections or arrests. In other words, the Suppression and Reconstruction Corps must cooperate with the military and police in this task and be in an assisting position under the command of the military and police organs. According to the brigade commander's report, the work achievements in the past month are as follows: (1) Fourteen people's service stations have been established, receiving a total of 1,871 secret reports, of which 36% were for raising prices, 15% for hoarding, 1.6% for smuggling materials, 3% for gold and banknote trading, 1.5% for housing disputes, 2.8% for political secret reports, 2.5% for corruption secret reports, 4.5% for suggestions, and 26% for other matters. All these secret reports are sent to Supervisor Chiang if they are major, and ordinary ones are handled by the economic police. The Suppression and Reconstruction Corps itself only assists in the investigation if it encounters particularly complicated cases.

Assisting in Participating in Economic Inspection Work

(2) People's discussion meetings were held in each district where people's service stations were established, extensively seeking out the people's hidden grievances. Citizens participated very enthusiastically. The general opinion was to impose the most severe punishments on unscrupulous merchants and hoped that the Suppression and Reconstruction Corps would be stationed in Shanghai for a long time. They deeply resented the exploitation of scalpers and middlemen. The Suppression and Reconstruction Corps relayed these opinions of the people to the authorities, and thus there was a large-scale capture of scalpers. In the future, they will continue to actively implement the crackdown on the exploitation of middlemen. (3) Assisting the economic police and participating in economic inspections, a total of one company of team members was dispatched and mixed and distributed among the various economic police brigades. In the past month, a total of 500 cases of illegal price increases, 100 cases of hoarding, 100 cases of black market, 11 cases of underground banks, 51 cases of buying and selling gold and banknotes, and 21 cases of evading foreign exchange have been handled. (4) Participating in the work of inspection stations organized by the military, police, and gendarmerie in the urban area, one person was dispatched to each station, and seven people were dispatched to the two railway bureau inspection stations. (5) One company of team members was sent to Wuxi to cooperate with the local administrative authorities to carry out the same tasks as in Shanghai. In the past month, many important cases have been solved, including the hoarding case of Central Pharmacy, the hoarding case of Da Ming Yarn Factory, the case of Lin Liangbao's funding of bandits with materials, and the hoarding case of Li Xinsheng Kerosene Company.

Anonymous Secret Reports Will Not Be Adopted

The work of the Suppression and Reconstruction Team is based on law and reason and has nothing mysterious about it. However, because the general public does not fully understand it, some criminals have impersonated members of the Suppression and Reconstruction Team to extort money or act lawlessly. Some foolish merchants were deceived and did not dare to speak out. The team has discovered four cases of impersonation and fraud. When the stolen money was recovered and returned to the original owners, these merchants, who were accustomed to the social atmosphere of Shanghai, were stunned and thought it was a great "miracle." Therefore, the brigade commander repeatedly urged citizens to pay attention. Whenever members of the Suppression and Reconstruction Team are dispatched for inspection or arrest, they must cooperate with the military and police and have their identification cards with them. Otherwise, they are impersonating and can be reported to the team or the security organs for detention. In addition, many of the secret reports received by the team's people's service station were not signed. After investigation, it was found that 40% were false accusations. Therefore, in the future, anonymous secret reports can only be used as a reference and will not be adopted. The name, address, and facts of the accused in the secret report should be described in detail. The secret report should be sent to the various people's service stations or mailed to the postal mailbox number Shen Zi 7009. Do not misplace it.

Will Never Allow Evil Forces to Run Rampant

Similarly, the recently established Greater Shanghai Youth Service Corps is also an organization that is not a special class, not an executive agency, has no rights, and is completely obligatory, for the country and the people. According to Wang Sheng, who is also the commander of the corps, the reason for the establishment of the team is: first, to respond to the President's instruction to "the people should take the lead in helping the government," and second, to unite the forces of justice in the local area to permanently ensure that evil forces do not run rampant.

Of the members of the Youth Service Corps, 12% have a college degree or above, 45% have a middle school degree, 25% have an elementary school degree, and 18% have other degrees. 56% of the members' original occupations were in industry and commerce, 24% were students, 3% were freelancers, and 17% were others. The organization of the corps is divided into 20 brigades, which are under the jurisdiction of 100 companies. Each company has three platoons, and each platoon is divided into three groups, each group with 10 to 15 members. The work that the Youth Service Corps will soon begin is to assist the government in its lack of manpower, such as large-scale warehouse inspections. When working, they are under the command of the government, and each person has an armband as proof, which is taken back immediately after the work is completed. Therefore, their actions are also collective actions that cooperate with the military and police. There should not be a single person or a few people harassing others alone.

Unqualified People Will Be Eliminated

Some people suspect that the Youth Service Corps has a large number of people and complicated members, which may inevitably lead to abuses. Commander Wang reported yesterday that although the Youth Service Corps has a large number of people, it also has a large number of cadres. On average, each person controls more than 30 young team members, and he believes that bad elements will never escape the hands of his cadres. At the same time, while the current young team members are receiving in-team training, he is conducting assessments. Before October 3, unqualified luxury can be completely eliminated. After October 3, they will be confirmed as formal team members. After that, they will be given small-group training, not only political training, but also opportunities to pursue further education, so that they can become the backbone of starting a social revolution and changing social customs.

In short, Commander Wang said in summary that the establishment of the Youth Service Corps will definitely not have any effect on politics or competition for power and profit. The members who participate in the Youth Service Corps should all be proletarians, and those who have property should donate it to the country. The main task of the Youth Service Corps is to realize the people's livelihood-based social movement.

### Longyan Anthracite Coal in Western Fujian

— Our Reporter Chen Xiaofeng

[Aviation News from Xiamen, Our Newspaper, 25th] Longyan is located in the center of western Fujian and has become a major town in western Fujian because it produces anthracite coal. Many people are not very unfamiliar with it. Because the domestic war has not ended, Shanghai has felt that the source of coal is difficult. Many Shanghai merchants have come to Yan to investigate coal deposits and transport Yan coal to Shanghai for trial use. However, there has been no follow-up so far, but we believe that if Shanghai's industry can jointly invest with the government to operate and come to mine and sell in large quantities, Longyan's coal will definitely have a bright future.

Most of the coal reserves in Longyan are anthracite. According to

Geological Analysis: Longyan's anthracite coal belongs to the Permian period and is sandwiched between sandstone and shale, about half a meter to two meters thick. However, the exact amount of coal reserves in Longyan is still unknown because it has not been explored with scientific instruments. According to the report of the measurement made by the Fujian Provincial Government before the war, the coal reserves in the entire county are about 27.55 million tons. Recently, according to the results of the survey conducted by Chen Qifa, a technician from the Construction Department, it is estimated that the coal reserves in the entire county are more than 30,000 tons. However, these statistical figures cannot include the entire coal area of Longyan, so the exact quantity cannot be determined.

Investigation Report: The distribution area and quantity of coalfields in the whole county are approximately as follows: In the Xinluo district of the affiliated city, from the southern extension of Xiagong Mountain to Tashi Mountain, it is about 2 kilometers long. From the east of Cui Ping Mountain through the north of Dong Bao Mountain to Tieshiyang, it is about 7 kilometers long. The coal reserves in these areas are about 13.7 million tons.

Northeast Longyan: Taking Yanshi Ridge in Yanshi as the center, it is about 5 kilometers long, with an estimated 4.56 million tons of medium-grade anthracite. The coalfield in Subang Village, Yanshi Town, is about 2 kilometers long, with about 2.7 million tons of coal reserves. The coal area in Dagicun, Shuilongtan and other areas in Yanshi Town is 5 kilometers long, with an estimated 3.64 million tons. The coal area of Keyuanting in Baisha Town is 2 kilometers around, with a coal seam thickness of 1.6 meters, and the quantity is estimated to be 5.8 million tons. Other areas such as Meihe Township, Suban Village, Jimei Mountain, and south of Yuntan are estimated to have coal reserves of about 3 million tons.

South Longyan Coal Area: It is estimated that there are more than 2 million tons in Baituzhen, Xiaokeng, Shagang Township Chuanxiang, east of Shenxi Jiangbang, and Wangzhuang area of Caoyun Township, and more than 1 million tons in Baotian, west of Shizhong Town.

West Longyan Coal Area: About 3 kilometers east of Longmen, there are a total of 3.34 million tons, and more than 1 million tons in the southeast of Tongjiang and Xiaochi area. According to the estimates of the above areas, the total amount of coal in the county is more than 40 million tons. Longyan's coal reserves account for about a quarter of the 153 million tons of coal reserves in Fujian Province.

Chemical Analysis: Anthracite coal is the best in coal mines, containing 94% carbon and 2.5% chlorine. However, Longyan's coal has been tested and is indeed the best white smoke coal, containing 64% to 86% carbon, 3.2% to 5.5% volatile matter, and 5% to 25% ash. According to the results of various tests, among the coal areas in the county, the coal in Jiulong Mountain in Neisaka Village, Longmen Town, is the best, with a carbon content of more than 90%, strong quality and black color, like dragon scales reflecting light, and strong firepower, which can be called high-grade anthracite. The next best is the coal in Xinluo district, with a carbon content of 92%, the coal in Baisha with a carbon content of 75%, and the coal in Huishi with a carbon content of 82%, all of which are rare coals. According to the opinions of general coal users, it is believed that anthracite coal contains very little moisture, which is convenient for transportation, and contains very little moisture, which is safe for storage, and contains less ash, which will not reduce the amount of maturity or block the fire door, and contains not much volatile matter, which is suitable for household cooking and winter heating. In terms of industry, anthracite coal can be used for ship transportation and factory power generation. If it can be refined into coking coal, its uses will be even wider. The quality of Longyan's coal is considered to be very good by all parties. If it can be mined by scientific methods, it has unlimited hopes in industry.

Due to inconvenient transportation and the lack of establishment of important industries, Longyan's coal still relies on 300 miners in the county to use hoes and other tools to exchange tastes. Only manpower is used to excavate about 35,000 tons per year for the cooking of households throughout the county and a small amount of charcoal burning.

As for the exploration of coal mines, machines such as drilling rigs have not yet been used. They almost all rely on past experience to use primitive hoes to explore the inner layers and walls of the mine, or add wooden pillars to support the frame to carry out mining operations. In today's construction of South China, this work is urgently needed.

### A Tour of the Zhuzhou Railway Machinery Factory

— Our Special Correspondent Huang Chao Ru

[News from Xiangtan, Our Newspaper, 26th] Zhuzhou in Xiangtan, Hunan, was originally a small town that was not noticed by everyone. Since the opening of the Yuehan Railway, this is the central station, and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and the Xiang-Qian Railway both end here. Therefore, its value has increased tenfold. Due to the beautiful geographical environment, the central government had long planned to use Zhuzhou as an industrial zone. Before the war, many large-scale factories were preparing here, but they were all interrupted halfway due to the impact of the war. Today, three years after the victory, the work of rebuilding the factories is being actively resumed here. Currently, the larger-scale factories include Yongli Chemical Factory, Arsenal, Railway Machinery Factory, etc. Among the progress of the restoration of these three factories, Yongli is still fully focused on building the water tower project, and the arsenal has only built a few buildings. Only the Railway Machinery Factory has a little scale. Although it is still far from the completion of the entire project, some parts have already started construction. Therefore, when outsiders visit Zhuzhou, the Railway Machinery Factory is the only goal. This time, the reporter accompanied the Changsha reporter group to visit along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. On the first day, they arrived in Zhuzhou and, without taking a moment's rest, drove into the machinery factory in the original car for a two-hour tour.

The Construction Process: The machinery factory is not near Zhuzhou, but next to Tianxin Station, three kilometers north. The construction work began in the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), and was initially completed in the spring of the 27th year (1938). The factory was preparing to manufacture locomotives in the future, but when the factory site was built, it only repaired locomotives and vehicles on the Yuehan and Zhejiang-Jiangxi railways. Unexpectedly, while planning to continue expanding, the Japanese invaders suddenly launched a war of aggression against China. Soon, the flames of war spread to northern Hunan, and the Zhuzhou factory was bombed miserably. During the four battles of Changsha, the enemy's traces had repeatedly infiltrated Zhuzhou. After the baptism of war, this emerging factory was completely destroyed. When the Anti-Japanese War was won, only the steel frame of the locomotive and machine factory of the year's steel and concrete buildings survived, and the rest became rubble, overgrown with weeds and desolate smoke.

Factory Restoration Project: The factory restoration project began in August of the 35th year (1946) and is divided into two phases: the first phase is the repair factory period, and the second phase can achieve locomotive manufacturing. Now is the first phase of the project, and it is planned to complete the repair factory by the end of this year. The factory buildings that have been completed now include the locomotive workshop, machine workshop, temporary casting workshop, temporary forging workshop, temporary machine workshop, temporary power workshop, vehicle workshop, material warehouse, office, etc. The casting workshop, Baishigang Power Plant, and the expansion part of the locomotive machine workshop are under construction. According to the factory's report, they can all be completed within the year. As for the installation of machines, more than 30 machines allocated domestically have been installed. The UNRRA machines that have arrived in Guannei have been transferred from Shanghai and Kowloon to the factory. More than 200 units have been transported, and about 100 units have been installed. The rest are still being prepared. As for the power plant, a 750-kilowatt steam generator has been partially transported, and factory buildings are now being built to prepare power transmission poles. When the equipment is shipped by the end of the year, the power supply equipment can be completed. At present, the factory's power temporarily relies on a 75-kilowatt diesel generator. The factory's workforce has now increased to more than 200 people.

The Future of Zhuzhou Factory: Among the larger railway machinery factories in China, those in North China are difficult to exert their effectiveness due to the impact of banditry. South of the Yangtze River, except for Qishuyan, Zhuzhou Factory is the first to be recommended. Moreover, Zhuzhou Factory was established later, and the various machines are the most modern among the domestic railway machinery factories. In the future, the mission it will shoulder in the country will be the most important. Especially Zhuzhou is located on the bank of the Xiang River, at the intersection of the Yuehan, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Xiang-Qian railways. It reaches Zhejiang and Shanghai in the east, Guangdong and Hong Kong in the south, and is a land of fish and rice by the lake in the north. Across the river is Xiashesi, where the National Resources Commission plans the power center. Steel is taken from Daye, coal and coke rely on Pingxiang, and the manpower in Hunan is not lacking. Considering the geographical advantages, it is located in the heavy industry center of central and southern China, and the future development is unlimited. My country's locomotives have always relied on foreign imports. We hope to see Zhuzhou one day drive out self-made locomotives and run on various roads!

### Old and New Newspapers in Hong Kong: Two Forces Engaged in a Fierce Battle

— By Shaozhong

[Hong Kong, 27th Dispatch] Hong Kong, a beautiful and moving land cherished by British gentlemen as a jewel in the crown of the British Empire, is now also a paradise for many adventurers from our country. Whether in the political, economic, or cultural spheres, dazzling and intense battles are unfolding. Indeed, the existence of various newspapers on this island demonstrates the intensity of the struggle. On each of these newspapers, the conflict between the new and the old, the left and the right, and democracy and totalitarianism is constantly unfolding.

Speaking of Hong Kong's journalistic circles, one cannot forget two newspapers representing the two major forces in the country: the Kuomintang Daily and the Huashang Bao. The former was founded by Kuomintang comrades overseas during the early days of the War of Resistance and has been published for many years. Renowned figures in Shanghai's cultural circles, such as Tao Baichuan, Chen Xunyu, and Wang Xinming, have all been responsible for the newspaper or presided over its editorials. The current director is the veteran journalist Pan Gongbi. This overseas party newspaper, with its historical significance, has been reorganized as a company since last year, struggling to survive. However, its position remains at the forefront of the Kuomintang's ideological struggle. At the same time, it is one of the most nationalistic newspapers in Hong Kong, repeatedly engaging in righteous and stern debates with the British government for the benefit of overseas Chinese, leaving a deep impression on them. The Huashang Bao is the organ of the Communist Party. Initially, it called for support from the perspective of the people. Later, its true colors were exposed, and it simply presented itself as Mao Zedong's mouthpiece, boasting and exaggerating. Previously, the heads of its editorial and management departments were Sa Kongliao and Liu Simu. Recently, Shao Zonghan, who was expelled from Singapore after running a newspaper there, has been reassigned to Hong Kong to oversee the redesign. The situation remains the same, and its position seems precarious.

In the newspaper arena, the Sing Tao, Wah Kiu Yat Po, and Hong Kong Commercial Daily are relatively less politically charged. These three are also among the older newspapers in the area. Wah Kiu Yat Po has the largest circulation and most pages. Sing Tao is the most outstanding representative of Aw Boon-Haw's Star Group newspapers, with more pages and a considerable readership in the Fujian and Guangdong provinces. Hong Kong Commercial Daily was founded by Sir Robert Hotung and has a relatively serious stance, reflecting the voices of Hong Kong's business community.

The two major newspapers published this year are Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po. The content of Ta Kung Pao is similar to its Shanghai edition, and it seems to have a tendency to continuously improve. Wen Wei Po still maintains its old style, unilaterally leaning into the embrace of the Communist Party. However, technically, it is somewhat immature. Whether in news or supplements, it unconsciously takes a vulgar path, perhaps to cater to Hong Kong's taste!

In addition, there are many daily and evening newspapers on the Hong Kong market with considerable circulation, which are purely yellow news. They remain stagnant in the stage of pornography and martial arts, a phenomenon that cannot be found in any other newspaper scene in the country. They often use Cantonese to write and report news, which is regarded as an indispensable "spiritual food" for ordinary citizens (including workers and women) during their leisure time. As for the upper-class Chinese living in the Mid-Levels and interacting with foreign friends, they use an English morning or evening newspaper as entertainment while having morning or afternoon tea. Perhaps their appreciation of Chinese is the same as that of the ordinary citizens mentioned earlier, being accustomed to the "Hong Kong-style" Chinese exemplified by phrases like "If you want to park, you can park here."

### Wu Huawen's Property in Bengbu Confiscated After Blindly Defecting to the Communists

— Our Correspondent Qian Mengchao

[Our Correspondent in Bengbu Reports on the 24th] Wu Huawen, commander of the 84th Division of the Reorganized Army, who participated in the outer regiment battle of Jinan near Changqing, Shandong, suddenly defected this time. When the news came, people from all walks of life here paid special attention. During the enemy-puppet occupation of Bengbu, Wu served as the commander-in-chief of the puppet Third Front Army, with strong power and a long stay in Bengbu. Almost all the major traitors in Anhui province knew Wu, and his influence was prominent for a time, which was quite feared by the enemy. Last year, Wu firmly defended Yanzhou and made great achievements for his efforts in combat, deeply relied upon by the central government, and there were plans to promote him to a certain provisional army. This time, coercing a portion of officers and soldiers to blindly defect to the communists was beyond everyone's expectations.

Wu's old father, Wu Yiqi, has lived in Bengbu for a long time and looks very old. The reporter had met him once. During the enemy-puppet period, Wu Huawen occupied a property of the Zhang family south of the Tianqiao on Dama Road, covering an area of more than two acres. Wu Yiqi and his eldest daughter (Wu Huawen's elder sister) and others often lived in the residence. A few days ago, Wu sent someone to Bengbu, saying that his mother was ill in Jinan, and soon took his old father to Jinan to live with her. Before half a month had passed, news of Wu's defection came. It is unknown whether his parents had moved in advance in Jinan. Now that Wu has been wanted, his property in Bengbu will be confiscated in the near future. A part of his residence is borrowed by Wu's relatives, and a part is occupied by the garrison.

Wu is only forty-six years old this year. In his early years, he joined Feng Yuxiang's army as a primary school graduate and was later recommended to Baoding Military Academy as a student of the regimental school. He once served as the commander of the pistol brigade under Han Fuju. He is fickle and has the traditional style of Feng and Han. His deputy division commander, Ta Tuan-yi, was originally Wu's chief of staff, following Wu for many years. He is sixty-eight years old this year and was born as a scholar in the late Qing Dynasty.

### Good News from Northern Jiangsu Cotton Production

— Our Reporter Cong Yongshu

[Our Reporter in Nantong Reports on the 24th] Northern Jiangsu, close to the textile industrial areas of southern Jiangsu, is a vast cotton-producing area. The reporter is delighted to report: "Northern Jiangsu's cotton production has increased again this year!"

According to accurate estimates, this year's cotton production in northern Jiangsu is about 1.2 million dan, an increase of more than 200,000 dan compared to last year. The distribution of production areas is roughly as follows: Nantong 385,000 dan, Haimen 145,000 dan, Qidong 104,000 dan, Funing 138,000 dan, Yancheng 41,000 dan, Dongtai 219,000 dan, Xinghua 14,000 dan, and Rugao 116,000 dan. The total cotton planting area reaches 4,146,000 mu, accounting for approximately 55% of the total cotton planting area in Jiangsu Province. (According to the cotton field estimates jointly announced by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Cotton Production Improvement Advisory Committee and the National Textile Industry Federation this year, Jiangsu Province has 7,594,000 mu.) However, this number does not include the entire cotton fields in northern Jiangsu. The eastern half of northern Jiangsu, let's call it Sudong, (the division military region established here by the Jiangsu Military Control District is called the Sudong Division Military Region) is the central area of cotton production. Especially the salt reclamation area along the coast, which is almost entirely cotton fields. To understand the area figures in this area, we went back to the investigation reports of the early Republic of China: from the Yangtze River in the south to Chenjiagang in Lianshui in the north, from the Fangong Dike in the west to the coast in the east, it is 500 li long from north to south and about 200 li wide from east to west, with an area of about 11,000 square kilometers, equivalent to 16,540,000 mu of land. Along the coast, the sea gradually recedes eastward, and the beach land extends eastward, and the newly silted land increases every year. The fastest rate is 1.6 kilometers per year. If we include the newly expanded beach land of more than 30 years, this reclamation area should have at least 20,000,000 mu. Less than half of it has been reclaimed, and the mature cotton fields are only slightly more than half of the reclaimed land, estimated at more than 5,660,000 mu, which is not a small number. We know that the rural areas of northern Jiangsu have suffered successively from the enemy-puppet's ravages, and then suffered from the destruction of the bandit army. Now, they are gradually waking up from the bandit atmosphere, which is obviously a kind of progress.

The cotton-producing area in northern Jiangsu is large, and the soil is different, so the cotton varieties are very complex. Generally speaking, American cotton is suitable for planting in the salt reclamation area, while Chinese cotton is suitable for planting along the Yangtze River. Different cotton varieties also have very different fiber lengths, ranging from 13/16 inches to only 1/2 inch. The "Tuo" American cotton that used to be planted in this area has now torn up its golden signboard and replaced it with a new name called "Degenerated Foreign Cotton." This kind of American cotton was initially very popular among farmers, but for more than ten years, due to poor management, improper cultivation, and mixing with Chinese cotton, the quality has deteriorated, and the fiber length is only 13/16 inches, and the ginning outturn is only 31%. That is, 100 jin of seed cotton can only be ginned into 31 jin of lint.

### Evil Practice of Collecting "Chicken Grain" in Qimen for Rent

Tenant Farmers Appeal for Prohibition

[Our Correspondent in Huizhou Reports on the 27th] "Chicken Grain" is an evil practice planted by landlords in Qimen. According to tenant farmers, the creator was a powerful family surnamed in Xijie, the city center, who had produced many great figures in the past. The accumulation of property was naturally very rich, and they were also one of the largest landlords in Qimen at that time. Every year during the autumn harvest, its descendants would go to the countryside to supervise the collection of rent grain from tenant farmers. In order to cultivate their land, the tenant farmers always had to kill chickens and offer wine as a treat, and they did not dare to neglect them at all. When the master saw the chickens and ducks raised by the tenant farmers' families, he could not help but show envy. In order to win the master's pleasure, the tenant farmers had to give one or two chickens to the master to take back, and this became a common practice. Every year when supervising the rent collection, they would routinely ask the tenant farmers for chickens. When the tenant farmers' families did not raise chickens, they were afraid of offending the master, so they had to replace the chicken with grain of equivalent value. Over time, this became a habit, and the evil practice of collecting "chicken grain" along with the rent was started.

In recent years, although the family of a certain surname has declined, they still want the chicken grain from the tenant farmers. There are also quite a few other landlords who demand chicken grain according to the example. Now, Wang Renyan and others from Sanli Street Bao in the county have sent a letter to Huibao, appealing for the tenant farmers, hoping that the authorities will quickly eliminate the remnants of feudalism and liberate the tenant farmers. Knowledgeable tenant farmers in the countryside will also follow up with a joint request to the county government to severely ban this practice, so that this evil practice will no longer harm the people.

### Two Tragic Cases in Yixing: Wife Raped in the Dark of Night, Husband Killed Under a Kitchen Knife, Authorities Have Obtained Considerable Clues to the Perpetrators

Old Man Beats Daughter-in-Law to Death with a Carrying Pole, Corpse Cut into Eighteen Pieces

[Our Correspondent in Yixing Reports on the 28th] The area of Guagong Mountain in Fangqiao is remote and desolate. Liu Yousheng, a resident of Jiangsi Bridge, built a thatched cottage here because of his poor family and watched over the Taoyuan taro for people, and his family lived a hard life. At about 10 p.m. on the 27th of this month, Liu Yousheng was suddenly awakened from his sleep by the sound of pushing the door open, and he lit a lamp and got up to ask who it was. The answer from outside the door was "　Tingzhen Self-Defense Force," asking for a guide because they were not familiar with the road. Before he finished speaking, they had already broken the door and entered, extinguished the fire held by Liu, ordered him not to make a sound, and tied him with a rope outside the door. Seven people came in total, one watching the door outside, and the other six went straight to Liu's wife's room, forcibly took off all of Liu's wife's small clothes, pressed her down on the bed, and raped her in turn. Although Liu's wife struggled and cried, because the place was not close to the village, she could not get any help even if she called for help. At this time, Liu Yousheng, who was tied up outside the door, heard the sound and tried desperately to escape, but the rope was strong and did not allow him to struggle. He had no choice but to shout loudly, telling his wife that it was better to die than to lose her chastity, and warning the perpetrators that they were acquaintances, so why bother to force each other like this? The perpetrators, hearing these words, in order to avoid accidents in the future, had murderous intentions, and with the thought of "doing it once and for all," they found a kitchen knife in the dark, dragged Yousheng to the road, cut off his throat and killed him. Before leaving, they looted 2 million legal tender and a piece of soap. The head of the Baojia reported to the township office, which transferred the case to the county court to send personnel to investigate. After the case occurred, Chief Feng has obtained considerable clues and it is not difficult to solve the case immediately.

[Our Correspondent in Yixing Reports on the 27th] Wu Baozhi, a resident of Tangjia Village, Yongfeng Township, Zhangzhu District, has a wife, Song, and five sons. The eldest son, Shunqing, is twenty years old. Since childhood, he has been engaged to Lu Wu Mao, the daughter of Lu Yunxian of Yanshan Township in the district, as a child bride. They have been married for three years and have a deep affection for each other. However, the parents-in-law were unusually fierce and often abused Lu Wu Mao. The day before yesterday evening, because there was no water in the water tank, Wu Baozhi scolded her and beat her with a carrying pole, hitting Lu Wu Mao's waist. At that time, Lu Wu Mao laughed wildly, and Wu Baozhi, thinking that she was still laughing, hit her again with the carrying pole, and Lu Wu Mao immediately died. Wu Baozhi knew that he had caused trouble and committed murder, and was so anxious that he did not know what to do. He immediately called Zhu Ligong, a villager, to come to his house to discuss. They decided to move the body and destroy the evidence, so they chopped Lu Wu Mao's body into eighteen pieces with a kitchen knife, packed them into three urns, and buried them at the foot of Meizi Mountain nearby at night, and gave Zhu Ligong two dou of white rice, instructing him not to make a sound. The next day, Wu Baozhi instead asked Lu Yunxian for his daughter-in-law, and Lu Yunxian euphemistically persuaded him to help find her. Two days later, although Lu Yunxian learned about the situation, he did not understand the inside story, so he immediately reported to the resident self-defense team leader and director of the Fenghuangke Office, Chen Yinfa. After receiving the report, he summoned them separately for questioning, but there were no clues. He then summoned Wu Baozhi's nine-year-old youngest son, Wu Xiaogou, and questioned him in detail. Wu Xiaogou confessed everything that had happened. Then Wu Baozhi was summoned again. Zhu Ligong confronted each other. At this point, Wu and Zhu had no way to deny it and admitted it frankly. They were then escorted to the foot of Meizi Mountain to unearth the three urns of Lu Wu Mao's chopped body. According to the information, they requested the court, and the prosecutor Han Yongling, together with the forensic official Shen Zhigao, moved the corpse urns to Xushe Town for examination. For a time, the crowd gathered, and everyone believed it was a tragic and inhuman event. More than eighty of Lu Yunxian's fellow villagers (from Hunan) knelt on the ground and asked Prosecutor Han to seek justice. In addition to comforting them separately, Prosecutor Han took Wu Baozhi and Zhu Ligong into custody for legal action.

### Production Area Prices Are High, Dealers Are Hesitant: Food Rice Transactions Are Sparse, Miscellaneous Grains Are Scarce and Expensive, and the Oil Market Is Rising

Food rice transactions are few and far between. Due to high prices in the production areas, dealers have stopped. Arrivals are scarce. Yesterday, the South City arrived with 577 shi and 5 dou, and the North City had 523 shi, so the supply is extremely small. The prices reported in the market are mostly not open. The South City opened 220 shi of red coarse indica rice, priced at 17 yuan per bag. Other openings are few. The North City's transactions are bleak, the same as the South City. There are no rice samples on the market sample table, and the industry closes early.

Flour transactions are still mediocre. Because the retail supply of raw materials is almost exhausted, it can only maintain the allocated flour and cannot supply the market. Wholesalers have no supply. The bran factory has no supply and no allocation, and transactions are completely stopped.

Miscellaneous grains are firm and expensive without goods, which makes transactions even more sluggish. Sales of soybeans are few, and there are many people who are unable to purchase. Corn is not easy to buy in large quantities, and sorghum is not sold, waiting for the price to be negotiated and approved at a good price. After the sale of buckwheat, there are no samples, and the trend is favorable. Mung beans and broad beans do not appear. Sesame is high and chic, followed by weak. Raw peanuts have a few openings.

Edible oil rises slowly, and the trend is stable. Bean oil factories have daily supply. Yesterday, Datong Factory opened at 51.40, and Zhongzhi at 51.00. Spot prices are mostly 51 yuan, so it is up more than one yuan. Shengcai oil from Dade Xin Factory is expensive and scarce, and is opened at a limited price. There is not much glory or disgrace for hot rapeseed oil. Sesame oil is flat. Raw oil stations have limited prices. Soybean cake has no supply at all, and there are no transactions for the first time.

### Keemun Black Tea Sales Are Strong

Yesterday in the foreign tea market, exporting merchants' enthusiasm for Keemun black tea and Tunlu green tea remained high, but the holders still believed that the raw tea in the production area was strong, and they were all thinking about holding on, and most were unwilling to sell lightly, so the transactions continued to be narrow, and the situation was more stable.

According to people in the industry, the tea merchants are unusually optimistic recently because of the extraordinary demand for tea overseas. Unfortunately, this year's production is not abundant, which makes it difficult for exports to become smooth, and it is predicted that the future will still have a trend of continuous brilliance. As for domestic tea, acceptance is even, and there is a lack of lightness.

### Sugar Market Continues to Rise

Yesterday, there was another saying that sugar would be released for export, and because Taiwan Sugar Company claimed that the allocated price for this period would increase, the public's sentiment once again became favorable, and there was more sucking up by people in the industry with loose funds and many useless orders, and the market was firm and chic. The 20th-period Taiwan red stock sheet saw a rise immediately after opening, circling in the middle, and the market slightly increased at the close. Xinghua red had a slightly softer market due to more selling and a sharp reduction in acceptance, while the rest saw an uptrend.

### Guangzhou Restricts Remittances

The Four Joint Offices Relay Instructions to Operating Bureaus

The Guangzhou District Economic Supervisory Office, in order to curb the black market for Hong Kong remittances, issued an emergency order to local public and private banks, stipulating three measures to restrict inward remittances: (1) Reiterate the previous order that no bank shall handle Hong Kong remittances. Violators will be ordered to suspend business and will be severely punished according to law. (2) The total amount of local remittances paid by all banks in Guangzhou City each day, including remittances purchased, shall not exceed 200,000 gold yuan. Each transaction shall not exceed 500 gold yuan. Violators will be ordered to suspend business. (3) If there is a legitimate use for a remittance exceeding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, the reasons must be detailed and submitted to the Guangzhou Branch of the Central Bank for approval before it can be handled. The above measures have been notified to the Four Joint Offices by the Ministry of Finance, which relayed the instructions to the National Banks for compliance.

### Overdrafts and Bounced Checks Will Be Investigated According to Law

[Our Report] The Financial Control Bureau recently received an interpretation from the Ministry of Finance: If the checks issued by the clients of the banks are found by the check clearing house to be bounced due to insufficient deposits and excessive overdrafts, they should be immediately intercepted, and the banks should report to the court for investigation and prosecution according to law, and the banks shall be responsible for providing evidence. If the bank provides evidence to the Financial Control Bureau, the bureau may also directly transfer it to the court for investigation and prosecution. As for the point that customers are allowed to be exempted from sanctions for suspending transactions if the returned checks are caused by delayed delivery or defective goods, if the bank can provide the bureau with conclusive evidence that the customer has stopped payment, and the bureau verifies that it is true, it can be exempted from sanctions. The Financial Control Bureau has issued separate orders to the banking, money lending, and trust industries and the check clearing house for compliance.

### Early Repayment of Public Bonds Will Begin Today

It is instructed that the managing bank should start making payments from October 1, 37, and should be handled in accordance with the instructions.

### Non-Quota Import Goods: Foreign Exchange Will Still Be Allocated Discretionally in the Future

According to news from the Export-Import Management Committee, the examination of non-quota import goods listed in Schedules (1) and (3)A of the import trade regulations has been suspended since the implementation of the new economic policy. The reporter, considering that the import quotas for the seventh and eighth quarters have been reduced after verification, the import volume of various raw materials will inevitably decrease, and whether production equipment can still be applied for import has been a matter of concern to all parties. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter inquired about this matter with a person in charge of the committee. It was said that regarding the foreign exchange issue of goods in Schedules (1) and (3)A, the committee has recently received instructions from the Executive Yuan that foreign exchange will still be approved and allocated discretionally in the future, depending on actual needs. In addition, as the application forms for this type of goods were previously sent to the responsible departments of the Examination Division, making the examination work difficult, it has been decided that from today (October 1st), all designated banks, when forwarding application forms for Schedule (1) and Schedule (3)A goods, must send them to the Fourth Section of the Non-Quota Examination Division for collection and forwarding to the responsible departments, in order to facilitate the examination work.

### British Borneo Timber Has a Market in Hong Kong and Shanghai

[British News Service, London, 30th] The chairman of the British Borneo Timber Company reported at the 28th Annual General Meeting held in London that Hong Kong is the main buyer of Borneo timber. Other major markets mentioned include the United Kingdom and Australia. However, he also said: "We occasionally also sell timber to South Africa and Shanghai, and are currently trying to sell to Japan. From the UK, our difficulty is the shortage of ships and high freight rates, but we are still able to conclude satisfactory contracts to sell a certain amount of good quality timber. Our trade with Australia is also progressing, and we are maintaining continuous trade with Hong Kong."

### 30,000 Bales of U.S. Aid Cotton Will Be Transported to Factories for Use

[Report from this newspaper] The Cotton Textile Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai convened representatives of privately-owned yarn factories that received U.S. aid cotton at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the procedures for taking delivery of cotton in great detail. It is expected that approximately 30,000 bales of U.S. cotton will be transported to factories in the recent week to step up the production of yarn and cloth, which will be fully supplied to domestic and foreign sales markets and exert a force to stabilize prices.

### Cotton Yarn Generally Rises to the Limit; Cloth Prices Continued to Rise Yesterday

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market opened with a mediocre tone in the morning, but then, because various parties still intended to purchase, the market's silver supply was still abundant, and the industry's funds were ample, people purchased as soon as they saw sales in the market. The yarn sold by the Shenxin Factory on the previous day was completely sold out, and the buying sentiment in the market was strong. There was a shortage of 16-count yarn. Yesterday, the Wing On Factory only sold 10-count Jiahe, 32-count Jincheng, 42-count Jincheng, 42-count double-strand Jincheng, and 60-count double-strand Jincheng. The Fangjian Company also opened 20-count Hongkui, Hongshuangji, Cai Kexing, Xiangfeng, and Wuzi Jiushi brands, totaling 700 pieces, with the price still at 700 yuan. Throughout the day, the supply of fine yarn of various counts was very scarce, and the weaving industry was eager to purchase it, so the price rose to the limit. 21-count Shuangma yarn was still sold for 783 yuan, trading at the limit. The supply and demand of 20-count yarn were equal, 16-count was stable, and the trend of 10-count coarse yarn was not bad, with prices reaching the limit.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market continued to rise in price, and the market showed excess demand. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth opened with a slight drop of one corner, but then gradually rose to a high of 28 yuan and 6 corners. The prices of other cloths also rose close to the limit. Subsequently, the chairman of the industry association made a public statement, saying: "The cotton cloth registration procedures have been completed, but in the future, regardless of buying or selling, applications must be submitted to prevent the escape of goods and eliminate speculation and manipulation." He also advised his colleagues not to only target Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi Yuan Bijie as trading objects. Subsequently, the directors and supervisors sold more than 400 pieces of Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi Yuan Bijie in public, and the market situation stabilized. In the end, Longtou fine cloth closed at 28 yuan, up 4 corners from the previous day. Longtou B-character, Wufu Laba Tong, and Sijunzi Yuan Bijie, etc., had fluctuations of 1 corner to 3 or 4 corners, but colored cloth Shilin cloth was still stable. The buying sentiment in the market was strong, and there were not many sales. Although the Fangjian Company opened sales, the market was still strong. The total transaction volume for the day was 1,200 pieces.

Cotton Cloth Registration Completed

In other news: The cotton cloth registration was completed on schedule yesterday, totaling 1,465,267 pieces, 521,083 sections, and 175,508 yards, 2,402 meters, 16,162 pounds, and 839 bed sheets, equivalent to a quota of 2 million pieces. It has been officially submitted to the Bureau of Social Affairs.

[Report from this newspaper] The Cotton Textile Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai held a joint yarn allocation for privately-owned yarn factories. Yesterday was the second time for the fourth phase, and a total of 250 pieces of cotton yarn were released together with the previous time. In addition, from September 27th to yesterday, the total amount of yarn and cloth sold separately by various factories for four days was equivalent to 1,385 pieces of 20-count yarn and 53,200 pieces of cotton cloth.

Cotton Market Allowed to Decline

Due to the limited price trading of raw cotton, there is rarely any opening business. The source of supply from the production areas has virtually stopped, and transactions within the industry are neither entering nor exiting. The market situation is cold, and transactions are scarce. Zhoupu seed cotton is still at the limit price, with few transactions. There are prices for other cotton, but no goods.

### Rayon Firm

The rayon market yesterday was still cold, but because of the ban on carrying it out of the country, retail sales on this street have slightly decreased. However, the inventory is thin, and the industry is very worried. Furthermore, due to the abundance of silver in the market, there are very few spot sales of late goods. The trend is firm in the middle, forming a stalemate in trading, and the market situation has turned dull. Miscellaneous brands had some sporadic transactions at the limit.

After Shanghai University's registration, tuberculosis prevention work was launched. The results of the collective examination showed that among the more than 600 old students, more than 40 female students and more than 20 male students had abnormal lungs, accounting for 10% of the total number of students.

This semester, scholarships (paid from tuition revenue) were allocated, totaling 6,900 yuan, which will be unified with the municipal government's scholarships. About 200 students will receive assistance.

The highest salary for teachers and staff is 180 yuan, and the lowest is 66 yuan. All of them are higher than before. A total of 66,000 yuan is needed, which is paid from tuition revenue. After this, their lives are stable, and they should try to achieve results in research and teaching. (Zhongqi)

### On Handling Handover

— Lao Dan

Dongfang Jun discussed the absurdity, unreasonableness, and falsification methods of reimbursement in various institutions a few days ago. The reimbursement of institutions is once a month. The inside story of the handover of new and old in the institutions is also quite a bit. Because of what Dongfang Jun said about reimbursement, I also interspersed to talk about the handover.

An official of an institution, in order to be promoted, transferred, or dismissed, has to handle the handover. In the old-style institutions' expenses, many are package-style, such as the county yamen of the former Qing Dynasty. When the county magistrate leaves office, the handover only involves seals and some archives and files. Other things such as office chairs, tables, and stationery are taken away, sold, or transferred to the successor for a price. Some even destroy stoves, windows, and doors, so that the successor has to repair them again. The files of special cases are often hidden and refused to be handed over. The account books of money, grain, and land are also made a mess. Therefore, the person receiving is easily fooled if he is not an insider. Because after the handover between the new and old officeholders, there is a routine joint report to the superior authority that the handover is clear. In this way, even if incomplete and untrue files, account books, and funds are discovered later, there is no way to pursue them anymore. You can only admit bad luck and try to remedy it.

It is not surprising that the handover of an institution takes as little as ten days and as long as ten months. The staff handling the handover are either current staff members of the institution, staff members who leave with the departing official, or dismissed staff members, who are busy burying their heads in handling the handover list like handling reimbursement.

Before an institution is about to handle the handover, in addition to the personnel department compiling a list of staff, public servants, and affiliated workers, the busiest are the general affairs, accounting, disbursement, and material management personnel. Handling the handover in large institutions in big cities is one set of methods, and handling the handover in small institutions in the interior is another set of methods. But no matter what, there is mostly corruption. For example, public property is replaced by old ones with new ones, and bad ones with good ones. This is the most common thing. For example, electric fans, bicycles, typewriters, sofas, and even cars, they can use the most dilapidated old things to replace the new and good ones used daily in the institution. Other things such as writing chairs, desks, stationery, etc., need not be mentioned. It is said that after a certain person resigned from the Minister of the Northern Government ten years ago, the stationery and envelopes he used were still printed with the name of a certain department. Since stationery and envelopes are hidden carefully, other cultural relics can also be imagined.

The outgoing official handling the handover must pre-use the seal to cover dozens of blank official note papers, in preparation for future applications. These pre-sealed note papers can sometimes be sold for money. For example, if someone needs a certificate, he can fill it out at any time. With the majestic official seal, who dares to say no. This kind of play is the most important thing in handling the handover. Even a clean and honest official must have this move for pre-sealed note papers, in preparation for any possible needs.

Those handling the handover must be insiders, and those receiving the handover must also be insiders. If both parties are outsiders, or one party is an outsider, then the degree of loss for the outsider cannot be described in any words. If it is not handled well, you can be liable for losses in a small way, investigated in a moderate way, and even be in danger of your life in a serious way. In a word, it is a trick for both parties to see whose technique is skillful and the patching is proper. This is being an official, this is public affairs.

### Mosquito-Repelling Color

— Lin

Mosquitoes seem to have the ability to distinguish colors. If the color of your clothes is black, blue, or red, then mosquitoes will definitely swarm and come to regard your blood as their delicacy. Because, entomologists have discovered that mosquitoes are particularly fond of these colors.

The colors that mosquitoes dislike the most are white and yellow. If you want to avoid mosquito harassment, you'd better wear white and yellow clothes.

These words are not baseless empty talk. In the place with the most mosquitoes in Oregon, USA, scientists have conducted careful experiments. They called seven people, wearing seven different colors of clothes, dedicated to mosquitoes' attacks, and entomologists quietly observed. In half a minute, 1,499 mosquitoes flew to the black clothes, while in the same period, there were only 520 mosquitoes on the white clothes.

### Psychological Effect

— Fei Yu

There is a so-called "pre-existing state" in abnormal psychology. What we usually call the "psychological effect" is entirely caused by the "pre-existing state." We think we have a headache, and as a result, the head really starts to hurt. When we are walking, once we think that we have walked dozens of miles and the body is extremely tired, our feet become so heavy that we can't lift them up, and we can't walk any further. In short, as long as we have a stubborn wrong idea, our actions will often be affected by it.

Many disabilities are caused by the "pre-existing state." An old woman thought she had hemiplegia. Her left half of her body was completely numb when she was awake, and she had no sensation at all. But when she was asleep, someone twisted her left half of her body. She would immediately say: "Thief, you hurt me." From this, it can be seen that the sensation in her left half of her body has not been lost. Later, a psychologist thought of many ways to break her concept of self-confident hemiplegia, and the sensation in her left half of her body was restored.

The following example can be regarded as the strangest. A young military officer who had sleepwalking was discharged from the military due to hemiplegia after being injured. His lower body was unable to move at all. One night, he had a dream that his mother-in-law was going to rob his son. So in his dream, he jumped out of bed, picked up the pillow on the bed as his son, and ran out of his bedroom. The family was awakened by him and hurried to chase him. Who knew he ran extremely fast, and in a flash, he ran to the patio outside the house, then climbed a tap water pipe and climbed to the roof of the three-story building, still holding the pillow in his hand. Others could not climb up, so they had to go up the stairs behind the house and stop him and wake him up. Who knew that as soon as he woke up, he immediately threw the pillow and fell to the ground, and then his lower body could not move again.

### Close Sentences in the Depths of the Clouds

— Bai Jiao

I have an appointment with Weishu, Fanmu and other friends to watch the moon in West Lake in Mid-Autumn Festival. However, Yuanweng returned to Beijing for official business, and Yu Ran was stuck in Shanghai due to illness. In the end, only Sanmu accompanied me. Miscellaneous sentences record the journey.

Thinking back to this trip twenty years ago, the mountain scenery on the way connects to Linping, the rest of my life is unharmed, and the sights of rice and hemp are tied to my emotions. (Impromptu in the car)

The sound of the horn urged the monk and guest out of bed, setting off from Nanping towards the water at dawn. The autumn mist adds to Dong Saiye, and the distant autumn colors are full of red freshness. (Lotus flowers are very abundant)

The color of the first sun on the mountain is bright, and a dike divides the Ming Lake. The wind on the six bridges is light and no one notices it, and the sound of planting canes can be heard in the silence. (Before dawn, I accompanied Sanmu out of Jing Temple and walked on Su Causeway)

The Zhenji Temple stands high above, with mountains rising and falling at its foot. The mountain monk's temple retains heroic spirit, but gathers its strange emotions in the Sleeping Buddha Hall. (The abbot of Zhenji Temple, Master Xuchu, led the tour into the mountains that day, and the master presided over intelligence work in one area during the Anti-Japanese War.)

I stayed overnight on the first mountain of West Lake, and the bright moon in my dream became stingy. The morning clouds obscured the mountain path, but I still saw the mountain responding to itself. (Mid-Autumn Festival at Wuyun Mountain, no moon was seen. I went down the mountain in the heavy fog the next morning)

The pagoda stands quietly by the water, and the long bridge reappears, lying new on the waves. The mountains west of the river are self-going, and I leave my cane behind, leaving a person standing alone. (Looking at the mountains of Xixing from the Qianjiang Bridge below the Liuhe Pagoda)

The lotus pickers have left and the monks have come, and the moon is opening the oars in the heart of the lake. My heart is as calm as this water, and the mountains are facing each other with each Cui Kun. (Happy View Master Yueyou Night Lake Subnight Party Return)

### Medical Record

— Hong

I had a fever for a few days. Seeing that the situation was serious, I couldn't bear it any longer. I had to pick a church hospital to seek medical treatment, because this hospital could spend less money.

The hospital is closed on Sundays. This is probably God's will: the Sabbath should be rested and not allowed to work. So the doctor stops working, the nurse stops working, and the disease must stop working.

Waiting until Sunday afternoon, I hired a rickshaw to the hospital. When I arrived at the gate of the hospital, I saw that the iron gate was tightly closed, and many patients were waiting outside the door. Some were standing, and some were sitting on the terrazzo floor. The sign hanging in front of the gate said that the outpatient clinic was from 9:00 to 11:00, but now it was only 8:00.

I couldn't stand, so I had to sit on the terrazzo floor. The autumn wind blew the French parasol trees rustling, and the cold that brought in penetrated straight into the bones.

At half past eight, the iron gate finally opened, and the patients rushed in to get ahead. When I arrived at the registration room, I lined up at the back of the queue, but I wanted to vomit again and again, and my head was dizzy.

The registration was done by a nurse. I guessed that she must still be an old maid, with a gaunt face, a thin figure, and arrogant eyes. She sat high up, interrogating the patients. With a cold tone, she seemed to be full of unhappiness.

"What's your name?" the old maid was asking for a confession.

"Surname... surname Wang..." the countryman stammered.

"How old are you?"

"Four... forty-five years old."

"Which department are you seeing?"

"Which fruit? I don't know."

"You don't even know which department you want to see! Is it internal medicine or surgery?"

The countryman was dumbfounded by this, and the old maid was even more furious, and scolded with a sharp throat:

"Asking you, outsider!"

Fortunately, the patient behind this countryman came to the rescue, asked this countryman where he felt uncomfortable, and then respectfully reported to the old maid.

Having experienced this mocking formation, when it was my turn, I obediently and automatically reported my name, age, and that I wanted to see "internal medicine," and I was not scolded.

After half an hour, I was called into the consultation room. The doctor gave me a lightning diagnosis at a high speed of two minutes and prescribed a prescription. I took this prescription to the pharmacy and squeezed out a bottle of medicine water like squeezing out a household registration.

After all, the bones of the poor are cheap, and my illness was actually cured at once. Probably this is the miracle performed by the Virgin Mary.

Amen!

### Snow Studies Rouling

Most of the warlords in the past did not die well, such as Zhang Zuolin who died from the Japanese bombing, Sun Chuanfang who died from Ms. Shi's gun; Zhang Zongchang was sniped by Zheng Xiaojiang, and Xu Shuzheng was intercepted and killed by Lu Chengwu, all ending with a pistol. These people have killed many people! And bombs and gun handles are also things they usually use. It is not surprising that those who play with water die in water, and those who play with fire die in fire. Only Feng Yuxiang's death by cremation, and in a foreign travel wheel movie theater, is very unique. A friend talked about Feng's former military power, killing people without using ordinary punishment. For example, in Henan in the sixteenth year, he "buried alive" the military leader of the Feng army, Tian Weiqin, to death, which is one example. "Buried alive" and "burned to death" are both illegal penalties, often used by savages and bandits, heretics, and village fools for vendettas. Feng's strange death, is it regarded as retribution by karma scholars?

Electric fire is different from ordinary fire, and ships are different from land. Since the fire has started, why only Feng died? (In addition, a daughter was also killed, which is also unreasonable.) After burning Feng, why did this wheel safely drive forward to Aoxport? How strange this fire is, it is only to send "General Christ to heaven"? It is also said that Feng likes to make movies himself, but his technology is unfamiliar and he accidentally started a fire. Is it true or not? There is no way to verify it. Moreover, the ship he was on was "Old Su's" ship. Old Su was originally a mysterious country, playing the "Mystery of Life and Death." In 1945, Germany was defeated, and Hitler's whereabouts were unknown. There were various suspicions of life and death, all stemming from the Soviet general's repeated denial of Hitler's death. Another example is what is the use of taking Puyi to that country? Where is he held? Is he treated well or abused? The saying is different. He is truly good at playing the "hide-and-seek" game.

### Reminiscence of Wu Qingyuan

— Chen Yixian

The newspaper on September 27th reported a New Asia News Agency Tokyo dispatch on the 26th: "The Go match between Japanese Go master Honinbo and Wu Qingyuan has now progressed to the third game (a total of ten games). Wu won the first two games. As of the fifty-ninth move of the third game, the outcome has also been determined, and Mr. Wu is again hopeful of victory. According to the rules of Go, if Honinbo loses four consecutive games out of ten, he will be deemed defeated. Therefore, Honinbo cannot but go all out for the third and fourth games. If Honinbo fails, then the other Japanese eighth-dan Go players are certainly no match for Mr. Wu." After reading the above telegram, it happened that a Go friend in the old capital saw an article I wrote about "Wu Qingyuan" in Free Talk, and recently sent a letter to inform me of anecdotes about Qingyuan after he went to the East, including extremely valuable information, so I wrote this article.

The first game in Tokyo for Qingzhou was against Mr. Katsuhara, and he won. Later, he played with Mr. Kojima, Mr. Hasegawa, Mr. Fukuda, Mr. Hayashi and others, winning ten and losing three in thirteen games. His layout was cautious, guarding firmly and attacking sharply, and he was always victorious. Moreover, he was quick-witted and moved very fast. The opponent's masters often pondered, while Qingyuan picked it up at hand, with only a little thought. Therefore, the name of genius shook the three islands. Newspapers and Go institute magazines all competed to praise him, and he was given the honorary title of "Invincible Black Go in the World". Japanese fifth-dan and sixth-dan have been defeated by the Chinese Go boy (at that time, Qingyuan was fifteen years old and had not yet joined Japanese nationality), so the celebrities did not dare to easily go out. At that time, there was Inagaki in Osaka, a seventy-three-year-old man, who was a famous seventh-dan in Japan. Seeing that his colleagues were afraid of Qingyuan, he went to Tokyo to fight. Unfortunately, the result was a big defeat of thirteen sons. What is noteworthy is that Qingyuan was only fifteen years old at that time, and his victory over Japanese masters was his inherent talent and Go skills, not because he had studied Japanese Go for many years.

The Japanese Go Institute has two major competitions every year in spring and autumn. Qingyuan came to Japan at the age of fifteen (Showa four years), and participated in the Go Institute competition in the second year, winning the first prize four times in a row, which are recorded below.

The Japanese Go saint Shusaku entered the first dan at the age of eleven and entered the sixth dan at the age of twenty. Qingyuan had the first dan Go skills at the age of thirteen and entered the fifth dan at the age of nineteen. Therefore, the Japanese compared him to their country's Go saint Shusaku.

### Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation Official Documents Long Distance Travel Sparrow's Nest How Can It Be Occupied For Long

Gao Kun asks: For 30 years, my father has rented two floors of buildings to a Hua surname resident, with a contract stipulating three years. After the expiration, the Hua surname used the excuse that it was difficult to find a house and renewed the lease for six months. Unexpectedly, after the expiration, he refused to move out. My father had no choice but to sue in court, and the court ruled that he should move out of the house, but the defendant appealed and was rejected, and appealed to the Nanjing Supreme Court, which ruled to send it back for retrial. The defendant used the appeal and judgment period to delay the time, neither paying rent nor living in the house for a long time, which is tantamount to occupation. May I ask (1) How long does it take for the Nanjing Supreme Court to make a judgment in an ordinary case? (2) If the court does not make a judgment to move out for a long time, is it illegal for the plaintiff to move in? (3) How should the defendant's arrears of room money be calculated?

[Lawyer Jiang Pingfan answers] (1) There is no time limit stipulated by law, and it is difficult to predict how long it will take in fact. (2) In the case of a removal case that is in litigation and has not yet been determined by final judgment, the plaintiff cannot directly move in. Otherwise, it should constitute a crime of obstructing freedom. (3) How to calculate the rent arrears should be determined by local conditions and mutual agreement.
