### The Flames of War Spread Along the Pingbao Line: Qingye Policies Implemented in Dingxing, Laishui, and Xincheng, Fortified Baoyuan Defenses, and Peace Maintained in the Suburbs

[Our Baoding Dispatch, 17th] The flames of war spread along the Pingbao Line. Battle reports arrived from various strongholds along the Baoding-Zhuoxian line. Dingxing City faced continuous wave-like attacks by bandits until the evening of the 16th. On the morning of the 17th, after 6:00 AM, communication between the defending troops under Commander Chen Zhiping and Pingbao was cut off. Aerial reconnaissance this afternoon reported a chaotic situation in the city. The main forces of the bandit's 2nd and 6th Columns were moving north and south, with a portion looting supplies stockpiled at military stations for transport to Pingbao. Moreover, the bandit's 1st Column and Ma's troops repeatedly attacked the outskirts of Gaobeidian, Fangshan, and Zhuoxian without success.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] A major battle looms on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. The North China Suppression General Headquarters announces that at least three bandit columns have been discovered on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. In order to concentrate forces and proactively engage the enemy, Qingye policies are being implemented in Laishui (west of the railway, on the Pingbao Line) and Xincheng (east of the railway, where Commissioner Wang Fenggang is stationed).

[Our Baoding Dispatch, 17th] Military sources report that the focus of the Pingbao Line fighting has concentrated on Beihe Store, Gucheng Town, and Caohe Bridge. The defending troops in Beihe and Gucheng are under siege by the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 3rd Columns. National forces fought back day and night, with joint land and air counterattacks causing heavy bandit casualties. As of 1:00 PM on the 17th, the large iron bridge at Beihe remained intact. The struggle has reached a fever pitch, with national forces engaged in fierce combat. Additionally, bandits probed and harassed the outskirts of Xushui on the morning of the 17th. As of 2:00 PM in the afternoon, the battle had not yet begun, but a defensive war is inevitable. At 11:00 AM on the 17th, Caohe Bridge was under heavy attack by the bandit's 7th Column, and close-quarters combat with the defending troops has begun. Tanks and armored vehicles from Baoyuan are rapidly moving north to assist in the battle and launch a full-scale counterattack. Yesterday's reports of Caohe's fall were inaccurate; the suburbs of Baoyuan remain peaceful.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 17th] A spokesperson for the North China Suppression General Headquarters stated that the fighting on the Pingbao Line may not be the full extent of the communist bandits' actions. In addition to the current operations, they may be planning another significant military adventure, which the military is closely monitoring. The Suppression General Headquarters also released a battle report stating that the strongholds of Zhoukoudian and Jiyang Village, west of Liangxiang, fell to the bandits on the morning of the 16th, and fierce fighting is underway in the suburbs of Fangshan. Bandits attacking northwest of Changxindian engaged in fierce fighting in Dongxiwangzuo and Niutouzhuang on the night of the 15th. Reinforcements arrived by 2:00 AM this morning, and by 5:00 AM, the bandits retreated towards Tuoli.

[Another Dispatch] The Suppression General Headquarters announced: (1) Bandits attacking Dingxing launched a fierce all-night assault on the city, breaching the north and south walls in two places. Aerial reconnaissance at 5:00 AM this morning reported the fiercest fighting at the north and south passes, with defending troops still holding the city walls and fortifications. (2) Aerial reconnaissance at 9:00 AM this morning reported small groups of bandits harassing Caohe, Gucheng, Beihe Store, and Gaobeidian north of Baoding. Bandits in the Saidian and Liulihe areas were pushed west of the railway by national forces. (3) Bandits harassing Fangshan launched a fierce all-night assault on the city walls. The fighting was intense, but the bandits were repelled by 7:00 AM this morning and are now building fortifications in the suburbs.

[Our Baoding Dispatch, 17th] After full contact along the Pingbao Line, the North China Suppression General Headquarters issued operational instructions to the local military authorities on the 16th. The current communist bandit strategy appears to be "big fish eat small fish," seizing small national army strongholds. Moreover, with Baoyuan's defenses fortified, any reckless attack by the communist bandits would be extremely difficult.

### The Battle to Defend Xiangyang Reaches its Climax

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 17th] The hard-fought battle to defend Xiangyang, which has lasted for weeks, has reached its climax. Yesterday, bandit troops launched repeated night assaults, resulting in exceptionally fierce fighting. Some strongholds in the suburbs have been seized by the bandits, and national forces are currently relying on city defense fortifications to continue blocking and repelling them. Furthermore, local air forces again launched a full-scale sortie this morning to assist in the fighting around the city, continuing until 7:00 PM. Military sources report that the bandits besieging Xiangyang once broke into the urban area from the southwest gate but were routed after being blocked and suppressed by the defending troops. The fighting in the suburbs is still raging fiercely.

[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 17th] The battle for Xiangyang is extremely fierce. Bandits are launching all-out attacks on the city gates. A small group once broke in but was completely annihilated by national forces. As of last night, the 16th, communication between Xiangyang and this location remained open.

### National Forces in Western Shandong Recapture Important Strongholds, All Huanghe River Crossings Recovered, Bandit Army Cut Off from Retreat Turns South and Crosses Longhai Railroad.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 17th] The crack troops of the National Army in Western Shandong yesterday successively recovered important strongholds such as Hongchuankou, Linpuji, and Dongkou. As a result, all Huanghe River crossings on the south bank of the Huanghe River have been occupied by the National Army. The retreat route and supply lines of the remaining bandits in the area south of the Huanghe River have been completely cut off. The remnants of the bandit Chen's 3rd, 4th, 8th, and 11th Columns in Western Shandong turned around and fled south. Yesterday, they crossed the Longhai Railway near Dangshan and fled south. The National Army is currently pursuing and suppressing them. The Huanghai air group today repeatedly bombed the bandits between Dangshan and Yucheng and on both sides of the Longhai Railway, killing more than 300 bandits and destroying more than 20 wagons. [Our Jinan Dispatch, 17th] A crack unit of the National Army that went north from the Dingtao area of southwestern Shandong has now advanced to the vicinity of Jining and Yanzhou. In addition to the panic of the remaining bandits, the Huanghe River crossings were blockaded by the air force. As a result, in addition to the rapid Second Column of Liangguang fleeing towards Wenxue across the Wen River, the remaining 3rd, 8th, and 1st Columns and Liu's 11th Column turned south again and fled to the vicinity of Dangshan and Lanfeng. The National Army continued to encircle and suppress them. In addition, the three regiments, 17, 19, and 21, of Zhang Guangzhong's bandit troops who attacked Lincheng have been repelled by the National Army.

### Wanxi Local Militia Recovers Zhenping

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 17th] Under the support of the National Army, the Wanxi local militia has begun a heroic campaign to wipe out bandits and save the homeland. On the 12th, they captured Zhenping in one fell swoop, defeating the new 1st and 2nd Brigades of the Chen Geng bandit troops, and are now cleaning up the remaining bandits in the suburbs.

Fighting Moves North, Sound of Artillery Heard

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 17th] The first batch of National Army reinforcements for Shanxi arrived in Taiyuan by air at 10:40 AM on the 17th. After the National Army disembarked, women and student representatives waved red and green flags to cheer the soldiers who had come from afar to suppress the bandits, and expressed their respect on behalf of all the city's people. Powerful National Army units will be transported to Taiyuan in a steady stream.

[Another Dispatch] After the fighting in the Yuci, Taiyuan, and Xuzhou triangle came to an end, the center of the fighting has gradually shifted north towards the suburbs of Taiyuan. Yesterday evening, communist bandits took advantage of the opportunity to flee north to Nanyan Xiaowuyu, about 30 li southwest of Taiyuan City. The bandits were repelled by the National Army on the morning of the 17th, suffering heavy casualties. The sound of artillery thundered this morning, clearly audible in Taiyuan City, but the people's hearts remained as stable as ever.

[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 16th] On the 16th, Tang Shuyu's fiefdom, 40 li southwest of Taiyuan and a scenic spot in Shanxi, was captured by bandits fleeing north from Qingyuan. The Shanxi war situation has reached a turning point, but the bandits are still reinforcing. It is reported that the bandit's Third Column has arrived in Shouyang from Shijiazhuang and will participate in the battle. The main battle in the Yuci, Taigu, Qixian, and Jiaocheng areas has lasted for ten days. The fighting became more intense from the night of the 15th to the morning of the 16th. A unit of the National Army successively captured Xichang, Xibian, Xiuwen, and other important villages south of Yuci on the 16th. On the night of the 15th, bandits attacked Beichangdi near Huangzhai again, launching 19 fierce attacks, suffering more than 400 casualties, and retreated to Xihuangshui at dawn on the 16th.

### Foreign Correspondents Report on North China Government Observations: Will the CCP Split? Encouraged by Southern States' Resistance to the Cominform, CCP Within the Passes May Break Away From Mao Zedong's Faction

[Chung Sheh, Local Dispatch] Certain North China government circles recently believed that it is very possible that the CCP south of the Great Wall will automatically break away from the CCP that is aligned with the pro-Cominform faction. They also believe that the Soviet Union will abandon the CCP, just as it abandoned Yugoslavia, if they believe that the Chinese reds are no longer of any benefit to global communism. On the other hand, an agency told the Associated Press that they have reason to believe that if Yugoslavia's resistance to the Cominform and the courage of nations to continue their independent nationalism is successful, the CCP south of the Great Wall may split from the communists of the northeast. Their theory is that after being encouraged by the success of the South's resistance to global communism, the communists within China Proper may split from Mao Zedong and his Central Committee and attempt to establish a coalition government with the National Government. This action, even if considered or accepted by the National Government, does not mean abandoning the northeast to Mao Zedong and his Cominform communists. On the contrary, the internal strife within China Proper will end, and all efforts will be devoted to the war to recover the northeast. However, it cannot be ignored that after this series of events occurs, there will inevitably be conflict with the Soviet Union. According to those who made this statement, they have facts that can prove their views.

### Spokesperson of the Ministry of Interior Clarifies the Publication Law, Responds to Comments From the Press

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Interior stated: After the Nanjing Xinmin Bao ceased publication, press commentators stated that some believed that the government's decision to suspend the newspaper, based on the protection of the interests of the nation and the people, was reasonable and lawful. Others expressed regret that the government's measures exceeded the degree of reason and law. Some even expressed doubts about the law on which it was based. Here are some clarifications regarding the latter's comments: (1) If a newspaper's illegal record is a first offense and the circumstances are minor, a warning may be given leniently in accordance with Article 28, Paragraph 2 of the Publication Law. However, the newspaper in question has been repeatedly warned for illegal publications over the years and has not shown any repentance. Recently, it has intensified its efforts, openly attempting to harm national interests and disrupt public order. The circumstances are serious and fully constitute the punitive conditions stipulated in Article 28, Paragraph 1 of the same law, forcing the government to take the final measure. Some press commentary suspects that the government neglected to warn the newspaper and abruptly imposed a permanent suspension, which is a misunderstanding. However, some comments believe that the government's punishment of the newspaper this time was too late, which further proves the government's tolerance and painstaking efforts. (2) Some say that the provision has lost its integrity and cannot be used to bind the obligated person. However, the "intention to subvert the National Government or harm the interests of the Republic of China" prohibited by the provision already includes two meanings, and each has its independence in application. The effect of the prohibition cannot be affected by the change in the first half of the fact. The so-called loss of integrity is obviously a misunderstanding. (3) Although Article 11 of the Constitution stipulates that people have the freedom of speech, lecturing, writing, and publication, in accordance with Article 23 "The freedoms listed in the above articles may not be restricted by law except when necessary to prevent obstruction of the freedom of others, to avoid emergencies, to maintain social order, or to promote the public interest," the government's legal restriction of the freedoms enjoyed by the people within the necessary scope stipulated in this article is not prohibited by the Constitution. Although the current Publication Law was promulgated before the implementation of the Constitution, the government's crackdown on newspapers that endanger national and social security based on the necessary scope recognized by the Constitution does not violate the Constitution in the slightest. It is regrettable that a small number of people in the press are ignorant of this. (4) When we study the history of the freedom and restriction of publication, we must understand that the modern publication management system in various countries is due to the progress of printing technology and the contradictions that have arisen in the publishing industry. It is necessary to have this law to regulate the freedom of individuals to publish and protect the interests of the public as a whole. We cannot misunderstand that the current Publication Law formulated by the National Government is a product of the Beijing government era because China once promulgated the Publication Law and Newspaper Regulations in 1914, thereby denying its existence value. Looking at the Charter of Human Rights formulated by the recent United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press, it has revealed that the freedom of expression has its relative obligations and responsibilities. And it lists violations of national security secrets or incitement of people to use riots to change the government, etc., which should be subject to legal sanctions. It can be seen that the state has given legal boundaries to this freedom. Also, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, which are known for their democratic freedoms, the crackdown on publications is also scattered in various laws and regulations and is not without restrictions. Our legislative system has always belonged to the continental law system, so the management of publications has special laws. It is difficult to equate it with the country that adopts scattered provisions in the Anglo-American marine law system. A small number of newspapers criticized the Publication Law as an unnecessary branch law other than the criminal law, which is probably not deeply understood. In short, the law is a model for the people and the government to jointly abide by. Restricting the people is exactly to restrict the government. If the people can exercise their freedom of publication within the scope of the law, the government cannot interfere outside the law. Therefore, the most democratic freedom of publication is established on the basis of the rule of law. It is hoped that the national press will cooperate in the spirit of the rule of law for the freedom of publication, which is very fortunate.

### Control Yuan Discusses the Treaty of Peace with Japan, Committee Members Speak Enthusiastically, No Conclusion Reached, Discussion Will Resume at the Next Meeting

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The Control Yuan held its 20th meeting on the 17th, chaired by Yu Youren. After the report items were completed, it proceeded to discuss the "Proposal to Request the Government to Expedite the Treaty of Peace with Japan" submitted by Xun Zhan Guan and others. No conclusion was reached, and it was decided to discuss it in the first meeting on the morning of the 19th. The case was also attached with the opinions of the Review Committee as follows: 1. After the investigation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has neither taken the initiative in the Treaty of Peace with Japan, nor can it strive for good strategies to break the international deadlock. According to the provisions of Article 97 of the Constitution, it should be corrected to urge it to pay attention to improvement. The Chairman of the Examination Committee, Hu Yiwenhui, also reported on the examination process and its results, followed by enthusiastic speeches by various committee members. Xing Senzhou spoke first, believing that a vote should be taken. Qiu Nianhe, a Control Committee member from the same province, said: Failure to take the initiative in the Treaty of Peace is also a fact, and the correction proposal can be submitted immediately. Quan Shaowen said: From the standpoint of national diplomacy, something should be expressed, but international relations are a technical issue and can be handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Chen Zhiming believed that the actual situation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be studied first. Huang Baoshi said: The international deadlock is not limited to the Treaty of Peace with Japan, and whether it is necessary to start with the review should be discussed further. Wang Guanwu said: There is no concrete proof of the facts in the content of this case, and the Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Ye Gongchao, has already issued a statement in response to reality, so if we conduct an investigation and the facts are true, the correction case is not enough, and even if it is a correction case, a censure case should also be handled. Then the original proposer, Zou Lu, explained that the power of investigation of the Control Committee members is based on the provisions of Article 24 of the Rules of Procedure, which is to "obtain" an investigation, so an investigation is not necessary. At that time, some people proposed that the foreign affairs issue should not be limited to the Treaty of Peace with Japan, and that the protection of overseas Chinese rights should be added and included in the investigation, but when it was submitted for a vote, one was based on the opinions of several people and was intended to be approved in principle. The preliminary investigation will then be submitted to the General Assembly for discussion, but after the vote, only 38 of the 104 people in the room agreed, and it was rejected by a minority. Secondly, the review opinion was put to a vote, and 46 people agreed, which was also a minority and could not be passed, and it was decided to hand it over to the next meeting (19th) for discussion (Note: The full text of the case has been published in this newspaper on July 1).

### Merger of the Direct Tax Bureau and the Commodity Tax Bureau

National Tax Bureaus Established in Various Provinces, Merger of the Direct and Commodity Tax Bureaus in Directly-Administered Municipalities Temporarily Postponed

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] After the establishment of the National Tax Administration, the Direct Tax Bureau and the Commodity Tax Bureau of each province will also be merged to establish the National Tax Administration Bureau. The candidates for the directors of each provincial bureau have also been internally determined. The merger measures are being actively drafted and will soon be announced by the Ministry of Finance. However, the merger of the Direct and Commodity Tax Bureaus in directly-administered municipalities such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Hankou will be temporarily postponed. In addition, the organization of the National Tax Administration has been approved by the Political Affairs Conference. It is divided into five departments. The first department is in charge of direct taxes, the second department is in charge of commodity taxes, and the third, fourth, and fifth departments are in charge of personnel, general affairs, and accounting.

Remarks by Jiang Shuge

Jiang Shuge, the newly appointed Director of the National Tax Administration, told reporters on the afternoon of the 17th: He was ordered to serve as Director of the National Tax Administration, and he is now busy arranging personnel and merging institutions. He has not yet put forward a concrete business plan, but it can be said that the merger of the Tax Affairs Administration and the Direct Tax Administration is of great significance. It can be divided into five points: (1) Simplify the organization, (2) Facilitate tax collection, (3) Strengthen administrative efficiency, (4) Increase tax revenue, and (5) Save expenses. The most important thing is to simplify the organization and facilitate tax collection. According to Jiang, there are about 1,100 branches of the Direct Tax Administration Commodity Tax Administration across the country. After the merger, about 600 units can be reduced. The merger is currently underway and will be completed as soon as possible. Before the institutions in various places are merged, the tax collection business will continue separately. After the institutions are merged, the various tax items will not change, but they will only be collected by a unified institution. In the past, there were often two institutions in one place, and taxpayers did not know where to pay, but this can be avoided in the future.

### Commodity Tax Still Ranked First in Various Tax Revenues in the First Half of the Year

### The Legislative Yuan Holds its 21st Meeting: The Examination Law Passes Third Reading; the Tax Exemption for Grain Businesses is Rejected; the General Budget to Undergo Final Review at Today's Joint Session

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The Legislative Yuan held its 21st meeting on the morning of the 17th, chaired by Sun Ke. The meeting continued to address the unfinished agenda items from the 20th meeting on the 16th. First, the Examination Law passed its third reading (full text in yesterday's edition of this newspaper). After minor textual revisions, the discussion turned to the proposal by Luo Qinghua and others to amend Article 2, Section 7 of the Business Tax Law to include businesses dealing in rice and miscellaneous grains in the tax-exempt category, as reported by the Finance and Economic Committee. The committee convener, Liu Zhendong, explained the committee's review opinion, arguing against tax exemptions for rice and miscellaneous grain businesses and asserting that no amendments to the Business Tax Law were necessary. The reasons cited were that tax exemptions would not stabilize grain prices, and that rice and grain business taxes were local revenue, with varying regulations across regions. The Legislative Yuan should not disregard the opinions of local public opinion bodies and rashly grant full exemptions, especially since the state was increasing various taxes to balance revenue and expenditure. The rice and grain business tax should not be uniquely exempted. Subsequently, a few committee members defended the original proposal, citing insufficient review and requesting a re-review. However, criticisms of grain merchants arose one after another. President Sun put the motion for re-review to a vote. Out of 278 members present, only 13 voted in favor. This was met with mocking applause, a first for the Legislative Yuan. The review opinion was finally passed, meaning that the rice and miscellaneous grain business tax would not be exempted. Following this, the meeting discussed the Grain Administration Committee's report and the results of reviewing three proposals related to grain administration by Sun Xiangfeng and others, Liu Yunzhao and others, and Qu Zhisheng and others. The proposal by Qu Zhisheng to establish a grain storage system was deemed insufficiently reviewed and was returned to the Grain Administration Committee to be re-reviewed in conjunction with the Finance and Economic Committee. Furthermore, it was resolved to refer the proposal by Wu Wangji and others to draft a Land Rent Reduction Ordinance to improve the lives of tenant farmers and stabilize rural areas to the Land Administration Committee, and the proposal by Jian Guan’san and others to draft an ordinance on the requisitioning and requisition of deposits and assets of Chinese people abroad, along with seven reasons for seeking a public decision, to the Finance and Economic Committee for review. The reports by the Foreign Affairs Committee on the review of the Sino-Burmese border demarcation and the draft organizational regulations of the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Judicial Administration were not discussed. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM. Due to many committees having scheduled meetings in the afternoon, the meeting was not continued.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The Budget Committee of the Legislative Yuan has issued a meeting notice, scheduling a joint meeting of all committees of the Yuan for 9:00 AM on the 18th to conduct the final review of the national general budget. The preliminary review report prepared by the Budget Committee has been completed and will be submitted at that time. The Finance and Economic Committee of the Legislative Yuan is conducting a secret review of the:

Legislative Yuan Finance and Economic Committee Conducts Secret Review

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] The Finance and Economic Committee of the Legislative Yuan met on the afternoon of the 17th. Originally, the meeting was scheduled to continue reviewing the draft Provisional Property Tax Ordinance. However, because the Executive Yuan's request for review and amendment of the Customs Import Tariff needed to be completed as soon as possible and submitted to the General Assembly for a resolution before the end of the current session, the agenda was temporarily changed to secretly review the amendment to the Customs Import Tariff. All reporters were asked to leave.

### Two Major Suggestions for the Moral Re-Armament Movement

— Chen Ruyi

The 10th anniversary of the Moral Re-Armament (MRA) Movement was recently held in the United States. Two hundred delegates from twenty-four countries attended, discussing how to use the power of morality to address world problems. The conference was divided into two stages: the first stage, from the opening on June 3rd to the 7th, was held in Hollywood, Los Angeles; the second stage, from June 8th, was held in Riverside, California, and concluded on the 14th. The joint statement issued at the closing stated, "The war being waged in the world today is fundamentally a war of ideas. Therefore, a democratic life based on individual freedom and human dignity can only endure and be passed on to future generations through theoretical thought." The conclusion emphasized, "We will strive for the re-armament of morality as the unwavering theory of the people's livelihood, and fight hard in all countries and on the world front." At a time when the world is declining and people's hearts are sinking, this grand event, with the re-armament of morality as its central theme, is like a morning bell, worthy of deep reflection and bringing people infinite hope and expectation.

The members of our Perfect Man Philosophy Research Association, in recent years, have been working with people in the domestic cultural circles to promote the "New Morality Movement," the purpose of which coincides with the MRA movement led by Americans. I originally wanted to compare the contents of the MRA movement and the "New Morality Movement" in terms of their historical background, moral standards, specific propositions, and ideological essence, in order to arouse everyone's attention. However, due to space limitations, I cannot explain in detail. Fortunately, both aim to change the world and rebuild world morality, so that people all over the world can move towards the realm of perfection. Therefore, I would like to express my sincerity and put forward two major suggestions for the future of world moral construction for the study of the world:

First, periodically convene an "International Moral Conference." Historically, international moral conferences were held twice in London and the Netherlands in 1912 and 1914 respectively; but since the war, there has been no news. Because everyone does not value righteousness between countries, treaties are equivalent to waste paper, and peace loses its guarantee. In order to maintain world peace and promote human happiness, a large-scale international moral conference should be convened regularly, so that all countries in the world can participate. The Perfect Man Association made a suggestion in this regard at its annual meeting on April 12 last year. Later, the Ministry of Social Affairs replied on June 7 last year: "After consulting with the relevant agencies, we will re-examine it." On November 18 last year, the World Moral Association held the first plenary meeting of member representatives after the victory in Beiping, and also resolved to respond and unanimously advocated. On March 14 this year, the United Nations China Association held a member conference in Beijing. I proposed to the conference that the United Nations should convene an international moral conference regularly; and it would be most appropriate to hold it in China on August 27, 1950, the 2,500th anniversary of the birth of Confucius. The meeting place can be in the capital or in Hangzhou, both are acceptable. If the domestic situation is relatively stable at that time, it would be even more meaningful to hold it in Qufu, Shandong, the birthplace of Confucius. The conference resolved to submit it to the joint meeting of directors and supervisors for discussion. Recently, I received a letter from the United Nations China Association on June 12, stating: "After the first joint meeting of the directors and supervisors of this session, the MRA conference has been held in the United States, and Director Chen Lifu of this association went to attend, this case is reserved." Although the 10th anniversary of the MRA movement is an international gathering, its essence is similar to the annual meeting of an academic group, and it is based on Christianity. Although there are 200 representatives from 24 countries, it is actually less than half of all countries in the world, and its resolutions are not binding. It is obviously not enough to replace a formal international moral conference. I believe that China and the United States, in the eastern and western hemispheres, bear the greatest moral responsibility; this matter can be discussed by the governments of China and the United States, and jointly sought the consent of other countries. Recently, our country's leaders intend to invite the leaders of the MRA movement to visit China and participate in the Confucius Memorial Ceremony. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization may also hold a conference in China in 1950 at the suggestion of the Chinese Committee. If an international moral conference can be held in a timely manner, it would be a win-win situation. There are only two years left before the scheduled meeting, and the various preparatory work should be started as soon as possible in order to cope with that great scene.

Second, formulate a "Human Moral Charter." Since the signing of the United Nations Charter in 1945, the World Education Charter and the World Human Rights Charter have been produced, all of which are milestones in human progress. We believe that in terms of morality, mankind should also sign a similar charter, as a guideline for behavior. The Perfect Man Association resolved to compile a "Moral Paradigm" at its annual meeting on April 2 last year, the content of which is divided into general terms and categories of various fields, such as political morality, business morality, lawyer morality, doctor morality, writing morality, marriage morality, etc. Because this matter is of great importance and involves too much, it is still in the process of collecting information and sorting it out. Moreover, the ideal personality among the various ethnic groups in the world is not the same. For example, Britain values "gentlemen," the Soviet Union worships "heroes," Germany admires "supermen," and other countries have different goals. We believe that the model of mankind should be "perfect man" as the common highest ideal. The scope of our so-called "Human Moral Charter" is broader than the originally planned "Moral Paradigm." It must be the competent authorities and academic groups of various countries, together with experts in various disciplines, to extract the ethical thoughts and good customs of various countries, and provide specific plans separately, and then carefully review them, so as to integrate Chinese and Western cultures and communicate the new and the old. The content of the draft "Human Moral Charter" should be translated into various languages in advance, so that each other can fully exchange opinions, and then the "International Moral Conference" to be held on August 27, 1950 will discuss it in detail and formally pass it. The scheduled meeting period is ten days, at most half a month. Then the representatives of various countries will bring it back to their own countries and, within a few days, after being unanimously accepted by the people of various countries in a solemn manner, carry out the formalities of exchanging texts and signing. It is estimated that on January 1, 1951, all kinds of daily newspapers and periodicals in the world can be solemnly published at the same time, as a common norm for the whole of mankind. Then, the disputes of the national team and the tragedies of mankind will naturally be gradually eliminated invisibly. It is like a milestone in the great era; since the 1950s, the entire human life can therefore enter a new stage. And that "four-way moral conference" has also completed its most solemn and sacred mission! We believe that the establishment of a new moral system is a prerequisite for building a new world order. Our country's ethical philosophy has always been admired by insightful people in the world, and in the future, we should do our best to draft and review the "Human Moral Charter"!

At present, the collapse and disillusionment of the Taoist association has become a recognized fact; therefore, the re-armament and rebirth of morality is the most urgent task at present. Let's not say "the road is one foot high, the devil is one foot high." We believe that the power of justice will surely win the final victory! We must emulate Qu Yuan's noble character and integrity, and change the atmosphere of the times with the spirit of being alone in the world; and take passive retirement as a warning. We must emulate Zhong Kui's righteousness and ambition, and sweep away the dregs of society with the spirit of eradicating evil; and take tolerating traitors as a warning. We know that in the world, good people are often isolated, so they are frustrated. As the saying goes, "If two people are of one mind, their strength can break gold." "An arrow is easy to break, but many arrows are difficult to break." When stripping reaches its limit, it will be restored, and innovation will be carried out; this is the time, and no one else can do it! Only good people can quickly unite to save the current crisis! Zeng Wenzhenggong said: "Where does the thickness of customs come from? It comes from the heart of one or two people." But if you want to change people's hearts, the task is heavy and the road is long, and it is not the strength of one hand or one foot, nor is it the work of one morning or evening. In the future, the promotion of the "New Morality Movement" depends on the people of the world who have lofty ideals and benevolence to rise up and support it, in order to achieve the effect of promoting it widely; and I sincerely hope to cooperate with the leaders of the MRA movement, so as to concentrate our efforts and save the world from collapsing. It is not difficult for the ideal world of the family and the earthly kingdom of Christian doctrine to be realized in the world at the same time. This is the result of moral re-armament, and this is the vision of moral rebirth!

### Song Ziwen Takes Emergency Measures; Martial Law Imposed on Sino-Hong Kong Border; Two Regiments of National Army Deployed for Defense

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 16th] (Arrived) Sha Yuchong on the Sino-Hong Kong border was attacked by bandits on the 15th, following Sha Tau Kok. About 200 bandits attacked Sha Yuchong on the morning of the 15th. A certain battalion of the 154th Brigade of the garrison immediately fought back. After a fierce battle lasting five hours, the bandits repeatedly failed to capture it. Until 12:00 noon, the defending army, unable to receive reinforcements, retreated into Sha Tau Kok led by Battalion Commander Wang Xianzhen. The defending army suffered about 20 casualties, and about 40 soldiers were captured. In addition, about 20 customs officers were captured. Currently, Director Song Ziwen has taken emergency measures on the Sino-Hong Kong border, strictly ordering the defending army and the Huian County Government to strictly enforce martial law. According to people from the border, the area is now in a state of blockade and martial law. Two regiments of the National Army have been deployed in the border area and will launch a campaign to suppress the bandits. According to Hong Kong news, the bandits were commanded by Zeng Sheng, leading more than 2,000 bandits, attempting to sabotage the traffic on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. The Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in Southeast Asia visited the New Territories on the 16th. Xie Zhennan, Director of the Political Work Department of the Sui Jing Garrison Headquarters in Guangzhou, told reporters that Sha Yuchong is the Dongjiang channel for Hong Kong people, and also a base for private smugglers. Our customs has checkpoints here. The purpose of the bandits' attack seems to be the customs, because the bandits protect smuggling and levy water fees, so they have long hated our defending army and customs.

(Note: The above news was reported by the United Press yesterday and published in yesterday's newspaper, but the content was brief and not detailed, and it is slightly different from our newspaper's special telegram, so it is republished for reference.)

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 17th] According to news, Chairman Song Ziwen of Guangdong is scheduled to return to Guangzhou on the 18th. He has been here for several days to treat his stomach ailment. It is said that his condition has largely recovered.

### Reporters' Delegation Crosses the Gobi Desert, Arrives at Dunhuang via Anxi

[Our Anxi Dispatch, 16th] After visiting the Chijin Farm on the 15th, the reporters' delegation crossed 224 kilometers of the Gobi Desert in seven hours.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 17th] Of the 34 ships donated by the United States and docked in the Philippines, a relatively complete portion has been formally accepted by the representative of our country stationed in the Philippines. In order to save expenses, the authorities contracted with the Metro Company of Manila, Philippines, to have the company send personnel to be fully responsible for towing the ships to Zuoying, Taiwan.

The first three ships have arrived in Zuoying, Taiwan. The Navy's Third Military Region Headquarters and the committee in charge of towage and custody are jointly handling the handover procedures with the representatives sent by the company.

### A Ming Dynasty Silver Mine Discovered in Gutian County, Fujian Province

The silver mine was sealed and forgotten until now. However, whether there is still silver in the mine, and how much is stored, is still uncertain.

### Zou Bingwen Talks to Reporters About Rural Reconstruction Work; the Governing Body Will Be Established Soon

[Our News] Yesterday, a reporter visited Dr. Zou Bingwen, President of the Chinese Agricultural Society, and asked for his opinion on using US aid to revitalize China's rural areas. He said: "Rural reconstruction work is something that the country should do in peacetime. Now that US aid has been allocated, it is embarrassing to talk about rural reconstruction work again, but it would be even more embarrassing if the work is not done well after accepting aid from others. To do things well, there are only two points: (1) have a plan, (2) have the right person in charge. As far as I know, China still does not have a rural reconstruction plan. This time, 21 groups related to agriculture, water conservancy, and land administration across the country contributed opinions to the government and drafted a plan for rural reconstruction in China, which focuses on three points: (1) increased agricultural production, because the largest part of the rural economy is agricultural products, the most important part of domestic commerce is agricultural products, and the country spends the most money importing agricultural products every year, so increased agricultural production should be the top priority. (2) Water conservancy: In addition to agricultural technology itself, the most important thing for increased agricultural production is water conservancy. Too much or too little water can affect increased production. (3) Rural land administration: The most important asset in rural areas is farmland, and land reform is an economic and political issue, so rural reconstruction work must pay attention to land administration issues. This time, 21 related groups gathered more than 40 experts, spent three weeks discussing the results, prepared a plan to send to the government, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Water Conservancy, and Land Administration have funded printing costs, and decided to print thousands of copies of the plan, which will be published on the 22nd of this month. If needed, people from all walks of life can write to the Chinese Agricultural Society at Shuanglong Lane, Nanjing. I am not in a position to say how perfect the plan is, but it is a contribution to the country that it is the crystallization of the research and discussion of 21 groups and more than 40 experts. Regarding the governing body of rural reconstruction work, I heard that the US Aid Rural Reconstruction Committee will be established soon. The number of committee members will be three appointed by the President of China and two appointed by the President of the United States. The 21 groups have told the heads of the Sino-US relationship that these committee members must pay attention to having specialized technical and administrative capabilities. The three Chinese members must be hired from agriculture, water conservancy, and land administration, and the two American members must also be hired from these three aspects. You must not fill the number with "all-purpose" talents, then there is hope for the success of the cause.

### Two Major Policy Guidelines for Zhejiang: Ensuring Security and Increasing Production; Chen Yi Claims Preliminary Plans Have Been Made

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 17th] Chairman Chen Yi hosted a press conference last night for the first time, clarifying that the policy guidelines are to ensure security and increase production. Preliminary plans have been made for the former, namely adjusting administrative inspectorate commissioners to specialize in military affairs. For Chen's two major tasks, he will start by improving the system and clarifying official corruption. Therefore, he will first carry out a revolution in official documents, advocating hierarchical responsibility, using vernacular Chinese, and improving the personnel system so that the transfer of county magistrates is like that of bank managers. Finally, he said: he welcomes criticism from all sectors because the more truth is debated, the clearer it becomes. Subsequently, reporters from various newspapers provided suggestions for the authorities to consider.

[Another Dispatch] Chairman Chen is very concerned about the construction of farmland irrigation in Zhejiang Province. He is planning new ways to prosper the rural areas and has secured irrigation loans of 3.14 billion, with another 4.16 billion to be loaned out soon. A committee will be established to manage the funds, and a universal irrigation benefit fee will be levied throughout the province.

### My Country's Shipping Industry is Beset with Crises; Shipping Circles Hope the Government Will Pay Attention

[This City News] People in China's shipping industry believe that the US policy of supporting Japan has a significant impact on the future of China's shipping construction. According to Jiang Keni, Secretary-General of the National Federation of Senior Merchant Marine Officers of China, the comprehensive opinions are as follows: (1) The government should immediately adopt a proactive policy to protect the shipping industry, refuse any foreign merchant ships from entering China's inland rivers, so as to maintain shipping rights. (2) The government should accept the request of Chinese shipowners and not allow Japanese ships to carry Taiwanese sugar until Sino-Japanese relations have been restored. (3) The rise of the Japanese shipping industry directly threatens the development of China's shipping industry. China should immediately demand that Japan first compensate 500,000 tons of ships (Japan currently has 1.4 million tons remaining). (4) The government should, on the one hand, effectively protect nautical technical personnel, and on the other hand, expand the equipment of merchant marine schools and actively cultivate engine and driving talents. (5) The government should assist in improving the organization of seafarer groups, effectively guide low-level seafarers, and promote sincere cooperation between labor and capital. (6) The government should select technical personnel to go to advanced shipbuilding countries to inspect and study shipbuilding engineering, in order to build new ships ourselves.

### US Increases Air Force Reinforcements in Europe; Sixty Superfortresses Arrive in England; Bombing Exercises in Germany in the Short Term

[United Press, Scampton, England, 17th] A large number of US Superfortresses, flown by veterans of the war against Japan and Germany, arrived in England today, landing at three airfields in East Anglia. This is the largest display of US air power in Europe since the war. The 28th team will be based here, while the 307th team will be distributed in Marham and Watton, both of which have longer runways for giant bombers.

[Reuters, Marham, Lincolnshire, 17th] Sixty Superfortresses flying from the United States to England to be temporarily stationed at British air force bases may be delayed due to dense clouds over the Atlantic. As of noon today, only thirteen aircraft have arrived at three airfields in England. After landing in one of the first Superfortresses to arrive in England, the commander of the US 28th Air Division said that this trip was another routine training flight, similar to those flown to Japan. There have been many such flights in the past, and there will be more in the future. He added that there may be some ammunition on board for training purposes, but it will definitely not be used to shoot people. At the same time, Lieutenant General Lee May, commander of the US Air Force in Europe, said in Wiesbaden, in the US military zone in Germany, that Superfortresses may conduct bombing exercises with US fighter planes and bombers currently stationed in Germany, and Superfortresses may occasionally land in the US military zone in Germany. The London Observer believes that the arrival of the US Superfortresses is a demonstration directly related to the Berlin crisis.

[Reuters, London, 17th] During the Berlin crisis, these US planes will continue to be stationed in Europe. US planes will use British air force bases while in England. Unconfirmed reports say that French air force bases will also be loaned to US planes. The US Air Force personnel accompanying the Superfortresses to England number as many as 1,500. Repair personnel and supplies will continue to be transported to England by other aircraft. Earlier, the British Air Ministry also announced that the Royal Air Force also plans to deploy bombers to supplement the Berlin airlift system.

[United Press, London, 16th] The US Embassy in England announced today that the United States has decided to send sixty B29 Superfortresses to England for short-term training. This is part of the long-range flight plan stipulated by the Strategic Air Command more than a year ago. After staying in England for two to four weeks, they will fly to Germany and be placed under the command of Lee May, Commander of the US Air Force in Europe. There are currently thirty Superfortresses in Germany. The London Evening News believes that the arrival of a large contingent of bombers symbolizes the first major demonstration by Western countries since the Soviet Union blockaded Berlin. It is said that although these aircraft will not participate in the airlift to Berlin, Western countries are prepared to fully resist any attempt to interfere with the aerial supply line.

### US Attaches Importance to the Berlin Situation; Congress Scheduled to Convene on the 26th of This Month; Preemptive Measures to Deal with the Soviet Union

[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] After this winter's US election, whether Dewey wins and the Republican Party takes power, or Truman is re-elected and the Democratic Party continues to govern, there will be no major changes in US foreign policy. Both parties guarantee to continue to implement the established bipartisan foreign policy, take the lead in international issues, and jointly promote a constructive peace plan to counter the expansion of communism. Congress has scheduled a special session for July 26. Truman and the government's foreign policy leaders, as well as both parties in Congress, will liaise closely on foreign policy issues in the coming weeks to develop ways to deal with the policies adopted by the Soviet Union in Germany.

[United Press, Washington, 16th] Officials announced tonight that the US increase in the number of air force personnel stationed in Europe is a forceful action in response to the Berlin situation. The governments of the United States, Britain, and France are currently considering taking tough retaliatory measures to deal with the Soviet Union in order to break the Berlin blockade and will implement economic sanctions if necessary. The concentration of a large number of US planes in England is an unprecedented event since the war. Although this does not mean that the US Air Force will immediately resume large-scale operations there, it proves that the British and American governments have achieved close cooperation in dealing with the Berlin issue militarily and politically. Air Force authorities emphasized that the dispatch of B-29 bombers to England is only for training purposes. However, with the situation in Europe so tense, the relationship between this batch of US planes and the Soviet threat near Berlin is very obvious, and it cannot be concealed by official denials that the Berlin situation is the reason for the air force deployment. According to well-informed sources, the initial use of force will be limited to prohibiting Soviet ships from passing through the Panama Canal, on the grounds that the Soviet Union has also refused US vehicles from entering Berlin. As for the implementation of economic sanctions, in addition to the Western countries, other countries will be asked to cooperate in the sanctions. In addition, it is planned to send troops to protect trucks to Berlin, ordering them to break through Soviet obstacles if necessary.

### Food Storage in West Berlin

Well-informed sources believe that if the Soviet Union refuses to pay compensation, Britain will appeal to the International Court of Justice.

### Soviet and Mongolian Troops Clash with Germans in Germany

### Soviet Aircraft Groups Practice Flying in the Air Corridor from Berlin to West Germany; The Purpose is to Interfere with the British and American Airlift

[Reuters, Berlin, 17th] The number of Soviet fighter planes practicing flying in the air corridor between West Germany and Berlin increased suddenly today. Although Soviet planes had been practicing flying there for several days, the number of aircraft participating in the group suddenly increased greatly today, with the intention of interfering with the airlift of Western allies. At the same time, Western allies have taken steps to increase the amount of airlift from West Germany to Berlin. Many British four-engine York aircraft and Royal Air Force four-engine transport aircraft originally traveling between Europe and the Far East have been transferred to Germany. Royal Air Force Chief of Staff Marshal Ted arrived in Berlin yesterday to inspect the airlift situation. British Commander-in-Chief in Germany Robertson hurried back to Berlin from Frankfurt to meet with Ted.

[United Press, Berlin, 17th] The Soviet Union notified the West on the 17th that it would intensify its air activities in the congested Berlin air corridor, including blind training flights in cloudy conditions. The Soviet Union notified the Four Power Air Safety Control Center that it would use nine airfields near the corridor, a move that appears to be further promoting a war of nerves and may even be a direct threat to the British and American airlifts. The poor weather in Berlin has hindered the progress of the airlift. German sources said that the commander of the Soviet Air Force here, Alexander Troff, and his staff were discussing ways to reduce two or three air corridors.

[United Press, Berlin, 16th] US planes flew a total of 251 sorties in the 24 hours from 4:00 PM on the 16th, transporting 1,435 tons of powdered food, coal, and supplies to Berlin. British planes flew a total of 218 sorties, estimated to have transported 872 tons of supplies to Berlin.

### France Plans to Conduct Informal Probing; Negotiate to Resolve the German Issue; Foreign Ministers of Five Western European Countries to Meet in The Hague Tomorrow

[This Newspaper News] London, 17th Broadcast: The powerful here admit that Britain, the United States, and France will not be in a position to resolve the Berlin issue with the Soviet Union. The three countries of Britain, the United States, and France will continue to negotiate with the Soviet Union to resolve the Berlin issue. Finally, Britain and the United States will agree to hold a four-power meeting to discuss the entire German issue, but there will be much "bargaining" between the two sides before this is realized.

[Reuters, Paris, 17th] Diplomatic circles believe that France's attitude towards the Berlin situation and the political development of West Germany seems to be different from that of Britain and the United States. According to reliable sources, France has been engaged in informal probes to find out the possibility of holding a four-power conference to break the Berlin stalemate. France feels that it is still too early for Western powers to adopt a final showdown attitude on the Berlin situation. France deeply hopes that the meeting of foreign ministers of the five Western European countries to be held in The Hague on the 19th can correct some of the premature showdown attitude. Although the United States does not intend to attend, the Western European Union will fully inform the United States of the meeting situation.

### Two Airlines - Unable to Sustain Operations - Suspend Passenger Registration - Request Two Points from the Ministry of Communications - Shanghai-Nanjing Flights Completely Suspended Starting Today

[Our Report] China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation, the only two major civil aviation companies in our country, have decided to temporarily suspend all passenger registration starting today due to the recent skyrocketing prices of gasoline, increased expenses, and the unsustainable operational environment. Those who have already registered will still be transported as much as possible, and mail and emergency transportation will still be maintained with great effort. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the Ministry of Communications to seek a solution as soon as possible, requesting: (1) permission to settle foreign exchange according to the official rate, without the need for foreign exchange certificates; (2) if the above is not possible, an increase in freight rates by 150% to 200% according to the current rates. If this request is not approved, air transport may be completely suspended. Liu Jingyi, manager of China National Aviation Corporation, Wang Heling, Chief Financial Officer, Chen Zhuolin, General Manager of Central Air Transport Corporation, and Cha Zhenhu, Deputy General Manager, jointly hosted a press conference yesterday afternoon to explain the actual situation of the two companies, hoping that all sectors of society would understand and sympathize. According to CATA Deputy General Manager Cha, both airlines have been striving to maintain operations under difficult conditions since the Anti-Japanese War, but the current economic situation has forced them to face the greatest crisis. More than 70% of the operating costs of both companies need to be paid in foreign exchange, including (1) gasoline, (2) parts, and (3) the salaries of flight personnel. Gasoline is the most significant expense. When the price of gasoline rose to more than 100,000 per gallon in March and April, freight rates were adjusted twice, and the government stipulated that 250,000 US dollars could be exchanged at the official rate each month from the Central Bank, so the revenue and expenditure could still offset each other at that time. In May, the price of oil rose again, and freight rates were not adjusted. In June, the foreign exchange certificate method was promulgated, and the price of oil jumped several times. Although freight rates were adjusted twice, the difference was too great. Statistics show that as of the 16th of this month, the cost increased by 2544% compared to February, while freight rates only increased by 816%. At the same time, due to the abolition of the official rate foreign exchange settlement method, the company was unable to pay the exchange rate difference for the foreign exchange certificate. Since June 8, the company has relied on loans from the Central Bank to maintain operations. China National Aviation Corporation borrowed more than 1.1 trillion, and Central Air Transport Corporation borrowed more than 800 billion. If the authorities do not take measures by the 20th of this month, air transportation will be difficult to maintain thereafter. Therefore, passenger registration has to be suspended temporarily starting today. Regarding the two points requested from the government, if it is indeed difficult to implement the method of not using foreign exchange certificates, then adjusting freight rates is a must. Currently, China's air freight rates are actually the lowest in the world. Taking the United States as an example, the freight rate per mile is 7.5 US cents, and the fare from New York to Washington is 17 US dollars, a distance equivalent to that from Shanghai to Nanjing, while the current fare from Shanghai to Nanjing is less than one US dollar.

[Another Report] China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation jointly issued a notice last night. Due to soaring oil prices and unbearable losses, they have had to completely suspend the Shanghai-Nanjing line. Other lines, such as Shanghai-Beijing, Shanghai-Chongqing, and Shanghai-Guangzhou, will reduce the number of flights to reduce losses. Airmail will still be carried as much as possible.

### Mayor's Remarks After Returning to Shanghai - Believes US Aid Can Stabilize Prices - Requests Monthly Subsidy of 2 Trillion for City Government

[Our Report] Mayor Wu returned to Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday (the 17th) after attending the joint meeting of the US Aid Utilization Committee and the China Branch of the Economic Cooperation Administration in Beijing on the 15th. He went directly to his official residence to rest after getting off the train, and went to the city government to work yesterday afternoon.

At 5:00 PM yesterday, Mayor Wu met with reporters at the city government office. He said that in addition to attending the meeting, he also visited Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan and separately visited Finance Minister Wang Yunwu and Food Minister Guan Jiyu to report on the recent price situation in the city. The central authorities also believe that the skyrocketing prices are a national economic problem and not just a leadership issue in Shanghai. Taking the price of rice as an example, when Mayor Wu was in Beijing on the 16th, the price of rice there was higher than that in Shanghai. Wu stated: US aid can be used by the end of August, of which 20 million US dollars will be used to stabilize finance, which is enough to make up for currency inflation, and he believes that prices can be stabilized in the future.

Regarding the city's financial difficulties, Mayor Wu made a statement to Finance Minister Wang, requesting an appropriation of 2 trillion yuan per month to make up for the deficit. Minister Wang agreed in principle and will submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval.

Regarding the hoarding of grain in Wuxi, Mayor Wu suggested that a portion of the tax grain, about 200,000 dan, be sold at market prices to stabilize public sentiment and stabilize grain prices. Minister Guan has accepted this suggestion.

The Social Affairs Bureau, together with the Garrison Command, the Military Police Regiment, the Police Bureau, and the Jianghai Customs, began to conduct inspections of the first batch of 34 unregistered warehouses in the city for the past two days. It is reported that the first batch has been inspected, and several have been found to be suspected of hoarding. Evidence is being collected and a decision can be made within the next week. If hoarding is confirmed, they will be sealed up and the owners will be investigated and dealt with according to law.

### Agile and Swift Action by the City Police Bureau's Flying Fortress: Duty Team Members Maintain Constant Vigilance

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] In the many major criminal cases that have occurred in this city in the past six months, the Police Bureau's Flying Fortress has given the public an exceptionally fresh and clear impression. Swift in action and effective in results, on the grand stage, facing alarming disturbances, each team member seems to possess inexhaustible energy, controlling everything from beginning to end.

The Police Bureau has put a lot of thought and planning into cultivating this energy. From the city's more than ten thousand long-term police officers, sixty team members were selected, and from the hundreds and thousands of internal and external personnel, two chief and deputy commanders and four commanders were appointed. Added to this are several mobile vehicles; that is their entire organization. But within it already reside administrative, legal, and criminal experts, nearly thirty kinds of dialects, and over ten modern skills such as shooting, driving, combat, and swimming, as well as many novel scientific knowledge. This entirely young and unmarried team has only been established for half a year, yet theft cases in the city center, especially the banking district, have clearly decreased sharply. The appropriate explanation for this fact is that robbers fear their new capture techniques and, even more so, the shortened capture speed, which is enough to threaten the time for carrying out robberies.

Deployed in 45 Seconds

Why is the Flying Fortress's deployment rate so high? This is due to the high performance of the telecommunications control room. When a victim reports an alarm using the numbers 12220 or 15380, the control room immediately triggers the bell before inquiring about the details. Before the alarm bell stops ringing, the mobile vehicles have already driven out and are standing by. The team members then put on protective vests in the vehicle, prepare their weapons and ammunition, and wipe the searchlights. Once the commander receives detailed orders, boards the vehicle, and starts it, the entire process takes no more than forty-five seconds. According to their records, it takes 13 minutes to drive from the team headquarters to Guanghua University at night, and 15 minutes to reach the Da Guangming Theater during the day. Despite the police car shouting all the way without obstruction, congested traffic still causes some variation in their arrival time.

Originally Just a Husband and Wife Quarrel

During their time on duty, the team members experience a level of nervous tension incomparable to any other profession, constantly listening to the alarm bell and always preparing for a fight. The commander works even harder, getting only three hours of rest each day. Upon receiving an alarm, he is responsible for keeping the destination secret and giving instructions on the vehicle to prevent the driver from colluding with outsiders. Upon arrival at the scene, he uses the colored lights on the front of the vehicle to direct the assembly and dispersal of the team and their movements. Every time they are stationed in the team headquarters, waiting on standby, their tense emotions often conjure up fantasies about the scene of the incident: bandits, crowds, thugs… swiftly subdue them! Just waiting for the alarm bell to ring. Once, the alarm bell rang, and they excitedly rushed to the scene, but there was no activity. Upon investigation, it turned out to be a quarrel between a young couple. The woman, unwilling to be at a disadvantage, rushed out to call the Flying Fortress for help. By the time they arrived, the couple had already turned their tears into smiles and reconciled as before.

Eloquence Defuses Crowds

To date, the Flying Fortress has not been involved in many bloody battles, but their performance in cleverly deterring stubborn enemies has been quite successful. In a major robbery in the Jing'an District, the twelve team members were outnumbered by the robbers. They used a roundabout encirclement method to delay the target until the main force arrived and made the capture. The night before last, at the Da Hua and Guo Tai theaters, a dispute over limited-price tickets after a price increase caused an uproar among the audience. It is said that they used their eloquent skills to stabilize the crowd, who were attempting to rush into the theater, in a democratic and gentle manner.

From the statistics of the number of deployments of the Flying Fortress from December of last year to the end of June this year, we can see the general public security situation in Shanghai: 34 theft alarms, 13 labor strikes, 6 student strikes, 8 riots, 69 surprise inspections, 40 false alarms, and 47 investigations of stolen vehicles.

To understand the impact of this social unrest on everyone's lives, we really should first understand the Flying Fortress's concern for every citizen and the hard work it undertakes for us.

### Military Throws Grenades at Two Theaters, Causing Tragedy: Garrison Command Sternly Interrogates Suspects

[Report from This Newspaper] The night before last, at the Da Wu Tai and Gong Wu Tai theaters, military personnel, prevented from watching the show without tickets, threw hand grenades, causing a tragic incident resulting in more than ten deaths and injuries. Afterwards, the First Battalion of the Ninth Regiment of the Military Police arrested 23 military personnel suspected of causing the incident at the scene. Yesterday morning at 2:00 AM, they were transferred to the Garrison Command along with brief statements taken during the interrogation. Yesterday, the Military Law Department of the Garrison Command conducted a strict interrogation all day. Soldier Yang Shu Yun, who was injured at the Da Shi Jie, sought treatment at the Nanyang Hospital on his own. Upon learning that he was suspected of throwing grenades at the Da Shi Jie, the Garrison Command has sent personnel to monitor him at the hospital. Once Yang's condition improves slightly, the case will be handled jointly. It is reported that the soldiers who initiated the incident will be severely punished if the facts are verified.

Youth Army Brigade Commander Discusses Investigation Process

Brigade Commander Fang of the Second Brigade of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army stationed in this city recently told reporters: Our brigade is responsible for the defense of Songhu and has the responsibility to maintain local public security. All officers and soldiers are able to strictly abide by discipline and care for the people. After the bloodshed at the two theaters the night before last, after receiving a telegram from Deputy Commander Yang of the Garrison Command, I immediately dispatched Chief of Staff Liu Changtai and Director Shen Min of the Political Work Department to the Da Wu Tai and Gong Wu Tai theaters to investigate. I also sent a squad of soldiers to guard and inspect the area around Tiantong'an Road on North Sichuan Road for any soldiers from our brigade coming and going. I also personally went to the barracks in Jiangwan to gather and call the roll of the officers and soldiers, and learned that no officers or soldiers from our brigade had gone out. Subsequently, Director Shen reported by telephone that the Garrison Command had discovered that the troublemakers were soldiers from a passing unit and had nothing to do with our division. Only then did I order the guarding troops to withdraw to the barracks. As for soldier Shen Deming of the Sixth Regiment, who was arrested at the entrance of the Da Wu Tai, he happened to be passing through the area after the tragic incident and was mistakenly arrested. This was an accidental event and he was not involved in the disturbance. However, since the Sixth Regiment is stationed in the Nanhui area, the reason why the soldier came to Shanghai, whether he had leave, has been ordered to be thoroughly investigated and dealt with by the officer in charge. Regarding the recent frequent incidents of passing military personnel causing trouble in this city, and the endless stream of cases of people posing as military personnel, our brigade has decided to discuss with the Garrison Command to jointly execute crackdowns with the military police to maintain order.

### Four Ephemeral Flowers Bloom in Splendor at the Great Shanghai Hotel

[Report from This Newspaper] At 9:00 PM last night, four ephemeral flowers simultaneously bloomed in the flowerbed of the Great Shanghai Hotel on Tianjin Road in this high city. By 11:00 PM, they were in full bloom, with red stems and white petals, exceptionally bright and fragrant. For a time, many people gathered to watch, but by around 1:00 AM, they had already withered. It is reported that the flowerbed was arranged by Li Pu Chen, the former manager of the Great Shanghai Hotel, the deceased father of lawyer Li Chao Nian. There are many famous flowers in the flowerbed, and the two ephemeral flowers have been planted for eight years. Twelve flowers bloomed last year, and five more bloomed a week ago. One also bloomed the day before yesterday, so yesterday was the third time they have bloomed. Dozens of members of the Li family gathered around the flower table last night, sipping tea and admiring them, enjoying the mood.

### Dance Craze Case Concludes: Sentence to Be Pronounced on the 23rd: Photography Reporters Invited to Testify Yesterday: Lawyers' Request for Bail Denied

[Report from This Newspaper] The dance craze case, which was tried all day the day before yesterday, continued to be heard by Judge Zhong Xian Da in the Second Court of the District Court at 9:30 AM yesterday. Except for Ye Ling, who was absent due to illness, all defendants were present in court to answer questions. Debate began at 11:25 AM and did not end until 2:30 PM in the afternoon. It was announced that the debate was over and the sentence would be pronounced at 2:00 PM on the 23rd.

When the judge, prosecutor, and clerk ascended the court at 9:35 AM, they first summoned witnesses Yang Ben Jun, Li Mao Mao, and Gu Lin Sheng, drivers from the Songshan Police Station. Gu Ting Peng, a photography reporter from this newspaper, Huang Zhang Cai, a reporter from the Shi Shi Photography Agency, and Han Cheng Qing, a reporter from the Da Gong Bao, were also invited to testify. The testimonies of the witnesses were mostly favorable to the defendants.

At 11:25 AM, prosecutor Huang Da Ping stood up and read the indictment. The defendants' lawyers then began their arguments. Zhou Yi Zhi, defending Zhu Mou and sixteen others, first said that the defendants' crimes were due to a small number of officials who were unaware of the severity of unemployment and banned dancing with a single order without passing it through the Legislative Yuan. Many people have spoken about this in the Special Criminal Court. The Special Criminal Court's ruling that it would not hear the case was wise, and he hoped that the presiding judge would make a final decision based on this principle.

Lawyer Zhou continued, saying that the defendants were willing to do anything because they were driven by hunger and were not premeditating. He pointed out that petitions are originally a legal action under the Constitution, and the indictment also stated, "The crowd was subjected to this unexpected stimulus..." He also said, "The bureau was in a meeting and was unable to come out to meet in time... leading to misunderstandings... due to the agitation of the crowd's psychology..." From this it can be seen that: (1) the Social Bureau was unable to cope; (2) the psychology of the crowd is different from individual crime and cannot be lumped together. Therefore, this is only an occasional dispute and cannot be compared to a riot. Furthermore, the number of petitioners reached more than four thousand, among whom those who truly beat people and destroyed property had already fled, and those who had a clear conscience were arrested instead. He asked the presiding judge to pay attention to how much the Social Bureau actually lost and whether the injured had injury reports.

Finally, he said that the indictment stated that the defendants were forced by life to commit crimes due to temporary emotional impulses. Therefore, he requested that Article 59 of the Criminal Law on mitigating sentences be used to impose lenient punishment. However, the article cited by the prosecutor in the indictment was the latter part of Article 136 of the Criminal Law. According to this article, it can only be applied to obstructing public officials from performing their duties. But in fact, this dispute did not target public officials. Therefore, the cited article is very inappropriate. Considering the circumstances, only Article 352 and 354 of the Criminal Law on the crime of destroying or damaging property can be cited, plus the mitigation of Article 59, to be fair.

Afterwards, the defendants' lawyers stood up and spoke one after another, generally the same as the previous paragraph. Wang Fu Qiang emphasized that the detention time of the detained people may have exceeded the date they should be detained and requested that they be allowed bail.

At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, the debate ended, and Judge Zhong announced that the sentence would be pronounced at 2:00 PM on the 23rd. The detained defendants were returned to custody, but if a medical examiner proved that they were ill, they could be granted bail. Then the court adjourned.

### Secretary's Wife Unable to Bear to Look Back: Husband Unfaithful and in Love with Another: Destitute and Ill in the Relief Association

Peng Le Shan, the English secretary of the Municipal Government during Mayor Qian's tenure, abandoned his wife Wu He Fen. Due to the pressure of life, Wu turned to the Chinese Women and Children Relief Association for assistance and filed a lawsuit against Peng in the local court for abandonment. The court ordered mediation, and Peng agreed to give Wu He Fen 20 million yuan as living expenses for their daughter. However, only 5 million yuan was paid at the time, and the rest has not been paid to this day. After the lawsuit ended, Wu He Fen, finding that the 5 million yuan she received was insufficient to support her life, still resided in the Relief Association. Her life and nutrition were insufficient, and her mood was resentful. Both mother and daughter, poor and destitute, were plagued by illness and were now in dire straits. Wu He Fen and Peng Le Shan were both from prominent families in Hunan. During middle school, Peng relentlessly pursued Wu, but was opposed by Wu's mother, so he did not achieve his goal and each got married. Years later, during the Anti-Japanese War, the two reunited in Chongqing, and their old love rekindled. Although each had already formed a family, Le Shan's pursuit of He Fen was no less than before. In the end, He Fen's husband became suspicious and divorced her. Wu and Peng finally got their lifelong wish. After the victory, Peng came to Shanghai to serve as the secretary of the Municipal Government and concurrently served as the deputy director of the Central Broadcasting Station. He fell in love with a female staff member, which ultimately led to this tragedy.

### General Labor Union Asks to Issue a Circular to Trade Associations: Wages Should Be Paid According to the Current Index

It is learned that the Labor-Capital Cooperation Promotion Association of the industry will hold a meeting today to discuss a solution.

In addition, the Anle Cotton Wool Factory, the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Union, and others petitioned the General Labor Union to request that the factories calculate wages according to the current month's index. The General Labor Union decided to ask the authorities to issue a circular to all trade associations to comply.

### Impersonating Health Bureau Staff to Extort Hotels: Arrested

[Report from This Newspaper] Chen Gui Sheng, the deputy squad leader of the First Squadron of the Cleaning Corps of the Health Bureau, was on duty at No. 725 Tibet Middle Road at 3:00 PM yesterday when he suddenly saw a suspicious person, resembling a civil servant, impersonating a Health Bureau staff member to extort the hotel at the entrance of the lane. He stepped forward and sternly questioned him, and asked him to show his service certificate, but he could not produce it. He was taken to the bureau for questioning and confessed that his name was Yuan Tong Min. He had extorted and blackmailed Sun Ju Xing's bao fan restaurant at No. 30 Pentang Lane on June 17. This was a repeat offense, and he has been transferred to the police station for strict handling.

### Youth Falls in Love with Dance Hall Girl

[Report from This Newspaper] Fan Xin Hong, a 21-year-old youth from Ningbo, living at No. 10 Tianbao Lane, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei, recently fell in love with a dance hall girl named Dong Xue Hua. Because he was opposed by his mother, Huang, the mother and son had a dispute. On the 14th, Xin Hong ran away from home and went to Room 314 of the Meng Yuan Inn on Hubei Road. After lingering for two days, at around 7:00 AM yesterday, he had a thought of ending his life and secretly took 54 sleeping pills to commit suicide. Fortunately, the tea boy Hua He Shang discovered it and reported it to the Laozha Police Station, which sent someone to transport him to Renji Hospital for treatment. By evening, he was out of danger. Fan left a suicide note to the tea boy, which is excerpted below: "Tea boy, I took a medicine to treat my illness last night. Carelessly, I took a little too much.

### Lobotomy (3): New Achievements of Young Doctor Liu Mingduo

— Special Correspondent Shao Shen Zhi

[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Qingdao, 12th by Air] Private Liu Shao Zhi, from Guizhou, 41 years old, was in combat when a large artillery shell exploded not far away. He fell to the ground in response, unconscious, but not injured. When he woke up, he became insane. He was admitted to the hospital on January 13th of this year and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His symptoms were unpredictable joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, and he often talked to himself, with a wide range of topics, repeating them over and over again, which was unbearable. He would constantly murmur to the outside world under the window in the corridor, several times a day in the same place. Apart from his name and origin, the rest of his answers were irrelevant. His movements were slow, and he maintained every small movement for a long time and without any meaning. He ate normally. His behavior was absurd, and he often looked for people to fight. He was indifferent to everything and only cared about taking care of his daily life, but without any special characteristics.

This madman underwent Lobotomy on the morning of June 18th at 10:00 AM. The operation was completed at 12:00 noon, and the situation was good. Now he has returned to normal. On the 8th of this month, when Liu Mingduo was invited to attend a report at the Qingdao Branch of the Medical Association, he was asked by the members to bring Liu Shao Zhi along. He sat in a soft car, and when he was in such a scene, he became a little nervous and uncomfortable. He is now lying down to recuperate.

"Patients need special spiritual warmth after the operation!"

Another one is Zheng Han Zhang, a 20-year-old Guangdong private, who was admitted to the hospital on March 1st. The following is recorded on the case history: "The patient's family cannot be investigated. It is said that only one member of the family has never contracted venereal disease or other infectious diseases. He suffered a gunshot wound to his left leg last year and was cured by the troops. He returned to the team after he recovered. He has never suffered a head injury. He studied for two years and can write his own name. He has been in the army for two years and is brave in combat. He has killed several enemies."

His symptoms are constant depression, tight brows, silence, but sometimes he sings alone. Or he mutters incessantly. When he gets impulsive, he destroys the furniture in the room and tears up his bedding. He suddenly runs away without a trace, and then returns to the hospital again two or three days later. When talking to him, he does not answer the question. But he remembers his name quickly. He can mostly remember the past, but if it is a little more detailed, he cannot answer. He often suspects that others want to harm him. He locks himself in his room and only takes care of his clothes, which are very tidy. He puts all the things in his clothes and does not ask about anything outside. He ignores the noise outside. At night, he becomes restless and suffers from insomnia. His appetite is normal. Sometimes he is very stubborn, refusing to change his dirty clothes or cut his hair. He is not interested in new learning. He has not forgotten what he has learned in the past, and he often repeats one action. He often shows shameless behavior. He does not know the amount of money. He likes to brag and exaggerate his bravery in combat.

This is what a madman looks like. The madness shown by this thin Chinese man is very obvious: he is completely crushed by the current life!

This madman had surgery at 2:30 PM on July 2nd, which was completed at 4:20 PM. Similarly, two holes with a diameter of about 3.5 cm were opened in the left and right parietal bones and cut. The process was good. A week later, he was able to get up and move around freely. Today, he took a photo with Dr. Liu Mingduo and answered several simple questions correctly. He did not seem to be crazy. The military hospital will continue to allow these recovered patients to stay and observe and record their future changes.

[Our Xiaoshan Office, 15th] For the nailing of doorplates throughout the county, the county government collected 18,000 yuan per household as a cost fee in March. Later, at the end of June, claiming the amount was insufficient, it collected another 20,000 yuan per household. However, the doorplates have still not been manufactured. The funds have all been embezzled by Yuan Youxuan, the Chief of the Civil Affairs Section. It is estimated that with over 100,000 households in the county, the amount embezzled exceeds 40 billion. The Fifth County Council has vehemently criticized this, and the section chief has been dismissed and is under investigation.

### Grain Profiteers Leap and Swarm in Xiaoshan; Public School Teachers and Staff Painfully Appeal

[Our Xiaoshan Office, 16th] Before the arms traffickers have been eliminated, "grain profiteers" have emerged in Xiaoshan. The salaries of public school teachers and staff throughout the county are all paid with grain coupons from the Field Grain Office. However, the various offices refuse to exchange the coupons for grain. Forced by their livelihood, the public school teachers and staff painfully sell them at low prices to "grain profiteers," who then sell them at high prices to landowners for tax payment. At the same time, the Field Grain Offices each act independently, exchanging high-quality grain for inferior grain, which has become commonplace. Moreover, the exchange rate for "using currency to offset taxes" is inconsistent, with each office consistently exceeding the local rice price by a significant amount, which is heavily criticized by all sectors. This matter is now like a raging tide in the Qiantang River, becoming a major public concern for all public school teachers and staff in the county. It is said that they will appeal to all sectors for improvements.

### Scarce Supply, Robust Sales: Rice Prices Rise Sharply; Flour and Edible Oil Also Increase by 10-20%

Yesterday, the rice market saw a sharp increase in prices. Due to the significant rise in various outside commodities and a loosening of credit, although the quoted prices in Wuxi were not high, public sentiment was particularly anxious. The morning market rose by 2 million, and due to strong actual sales, it rose by another approximately 2 million, for a total increase of 3.5 to 4 million. In the northern market, japonica, indica, and lamb indica rice were each priced at 33.5 million, with premium japonica reaching 36.5 million. The southern market also rose by 3-4 million, with rough indica rice at a final price of 27.5 million. The total arrival of goods in both northern and southern markets yesterday was 2,368 stones.

Flour prices fluctuated sharply. Factories released limited quantities. Old brand flour opened at 9.7 million, but strong buying interest pushed it past the 10 million mark, eventually reaching 10.5 million. Bingchuan flour closed at 9.8 million. Jiancheng, Hongfeng, and various other brands all increased by 1.2 to 1.3 million. Wheat bran rose by nearly 1 million, and wheat traded at 13 million, with few sellers, representing an increase of 1 million.

Coarse grains rose sharply again, with a general increase of 15%. Soybeans initially held steady, but a small quantity of summer beans was offered at 17 million, closing at 17.5 million. Winter beans were being purchased by the Qingdao group, opening at 21 million, an increase of 2-3 million. Corn and wheat bran were actively sold to the north, rising by 2-3 million. Mung beans rose by about 2 million, scarlet beans traded at 36 million, broad beans increased by 1.5 million, and sesame seeds rose by 2 million, with white sesame seeds trading at 40 million. Raw peanuts were scarce and consumed quickly, resulting in a sharp increase of 10 million.

Edible oils soared, and market sentiment was extraordinarily tight. Various oils rose by nearly 20%. With buyers scrambling to purchase at the opening, soybean oil opened at 77 million and rapeseed oil at 73 million. Near closing, there were more sellers, but prices decreased by 1 million. Dah You soybean oil traded at 76 million, Tongfeng soybean oil at 74 million, and Jitong rapeseed oil reached the huge price of 100 million, an increase of 1.5 million.

### Central Trust Bureau Ordered to Sell and Purchase Raw Silk

[Our Dispatch] The Central Trust Bureau has recently been ordered to sell and purchase raw silk to tighten credit. As of the day before yesterday, a total of 660,000 bundles had been sold. On the 16th alone, as many as 300,000 dan were sold. The selling price is determined dynamically, fluctuating with market prices. The highest selling price on the 16th was 2.1 billion. At the same time, according to market practice, payment for goods is due within five days. However, the Central Trust Bureau requires payment on the next day for the raw silk it sells, in order to reduce inflation. This raw silk sales operation will continue to be carried out in the future.

### Expiry Date Approaching: Foreign Exchange Certificates Fall

[Our Dispatch] The market price of foreign exchange certificates fell to 2.8 million yuan yesterday, before slightly rebounding to around 3 million yuan. The reason for the sharp decline is that the expiry date is approaching, and there is a shortage of funds, forcing sellers to sell at low prices. When the market price fell to 2.8 million yesterday, the Central Bank secretly bought them, causing a slight rebound. However, the current price of foreign exchange certificates is more than double the black market exchange rate for US dollars. The incentive for exports provided by the foreign exchange certificate system has gradually been lost. The National Bank is paying close attention to this and will soon take measures to ensure that foreign exchange certificates have a reasonable selling price.

### Credit Loosens; Most Banks Show Deficits

### Rayon Factory Prices Continue to Rise; Silk Prices Slightly Decrease at Closing

The rayon market continued to rise. The opening price of 120-count Jin San Ma Guang, was similar to the afternoon price of the previous day. Transactions were sparse, and it hovered for a long time. Later, due to rising prices of external commodities, the largest transaction was 2.44 billion yuan for the Monday term. The closing price for spot delivery was reduced to 2.27 billion yuan.

### Woolen Cloth Market is Expensive and Popular

Woolen cloth has recently seen an overall increase in price. The trend for mixed-color, fine-wool woven cloth is particularly strong. The market for dyed woolen cloth is also strong. Due to future environmental conditions, factories are mostly unwilling to offer their products, and stores are also mutually hoarding goods. Glossy woolen cloth is even more expensive and popular than hand-woven woolen cloth. Yesterday, English, Italian, and Western suit woolens were wholesaling for 40 million to 70 million yuan per yard, American goods for 35 million to 50 million yuan, and domestic mixed-color woolen cloth for 25 million to 35 million yuan, and dyed woolen cloth for 15 million to 22 million yuan, it is said.

### Tea Market Foundation is Solid

After the tea market's price increase reignited the day before yesterday, yesterday, due to credit remaining mediocre and the universal rise in prices of all goods, holders of goods were keen to match the price increase, and the intention to protect prices continued to flourish. Buyers, feeling that actual quality was still good, also readily accepted. However, in this situation, transactions sharply declined. Prices continued to move toward their peak, and the foundation was quite solid.

### Market Sentiment is Excited; Rise in Chinese Stocks Remains Strong

Yesterday, sentiment in the Chinese stock market was unusually excited, and the rise remained strong. Yongsheng Yarn rose to the limit and then slightly increased. New Guang and Xinyi also rose to the limit, but the addition of water made it difficult to maintain for long. There were ten struggles in the middle, and in the end, small stocks were weak. Furthermore, due to news of increased margin requirements, there was a small pullback at noon.

The morning market inherited the residual wind from the previous closing. Yongsheng Yarn opened high at 10,900 yuan. Immediately after opening, numbers 163, 95, and 126 moved up to the limit, with an additional increase of over one hundred yuan. Numbers 169, 218, 163, 67, 225, 183, 22, 145, and the Guangdong group's 202 actively sold, retreating to 10,770 yuan. Numbers 156, 224, 71, 131, 3, 178, 99, 163, and 15 all entered, and in the middle, there were eight or nine more rises to the limit. New Guang had a pullback after rising to the limit, while Xinyi and Yongye remained at the limit. Struggling until near noon, there was news of increased margin requirements, and cash was extremely tight, and credit had not widened to any extent. In the afternoon, numbers 104, 122, 16, 131, 225, 185, 156, 145, 218, and 4 were unloaded, retreating to a closing price of 10,750 yuan, while Xinhua even fell to the limit.

The morning opening price of Tong Bing was 1.12 million, with the highest price at 1.17 million, before slightly consolidating. Compared to the previous closing, Jia, Yi, and Wu each rose by 60,000 yuan, Tong Bing rose by 50,000 yuan, and Tong Ding rose sharply by 90,000 yuan.

### Cotton Yarn and Cloth Initially Rose and Then Returned; Fine Cloth Off-Exchange Once Knocked on the Door of 50 Million

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw an initial opening with still good buying from the Tianjin and Guangdong groups, and sentiment remained firm, with external factors also providing support. The quoted opening price for 42-count Lanfeng yarn was 2 billion for delivery tomorrow (19th). Later, due to the forced sales of the goods' owner, who were desperate for funds, the quoted price quickly fell to 1.8 billion for same-day delivery, and the market sentiment turned flat. Midway, local buyers took advantage of the opportunity to absorb small quantities, returning by 50 million. Eventually, news arrived that the authorities had notified the cloth market to temporarily suspend gatherings and inspect orders, which was unfavorable news. The final price for delivery next Monday ended at 1.75 billion yuan, a rise of 50 million yuan compared to the previous day. The 40-count and 32-count also initially rose and then returned. The initial transaction for 21-count Shuangma spot yarn was 1.4 billion, and buying interest from various parties was strong, with the price immediately rising by 100 million. Near closing, traders and speculators took advantage of the high prices to sell, ending with spot delivery at 1.35 billion, a rise of 90 million. Delivery the day after tomorrow traded at 1.42 billion, a rise of 120 million. The remaining yarns also showed firmness, with over 240 transactions.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw a renewed increase at the morning opening. The off-exchange price of Longtou fine cloth once rose directly to 49.56 million, an unprecedented peak. Subsequently, at approximately 10:20 am, the competent authorities, seeing that the cotton cloth market had risen sharply, telephoned the chairman of the industry association and notified them to temporarily suspend the market. Sentiment suddenly turned weak, and transactions gradually cleared. Traders from Tianjin and Shanxi sold off quite a lot. Longtou fine cloth retreated to 47.5 million near closing, a rise of 20%. However, there were reports that it was sold for as low as 46 million, while other fine cloths, bleached cloth, serge, colored cloth, and Xilin cloth, all showed firmness.

Further news: In addition to selling Longtou fine cloth by tender, the Fangjian Company also had more than ten other varieties, including second-grade gray fabric, auxiliary brand serge gray fabric, second-grade Yuanshai serge, Four Gentlemen Yuanshai mercerized cloth, Touma bleached cloth, and Caihua bedsheets. It is said that the self-filled price for Longtou cloth was 44.5 million yuan.

Those whose membership in the Shanghai Yarn Industry Association has been revoked are He Yulun, Dakang, Shencheng, Yida Company, Taichang Gong, and Guanghesheng. Sheng Yuan was notified by the Yarn Association to revoke two entry permits, while Da You and Ji were exempted from deliberation, it is said.

### Tea Merchants Request the Four Joint Offices to Relax Tea Loan Quotas; Scheduled to Visit President Yu Tomorrow to Petition

In order to absorb large amounts of foreign exchange, maintain the international market, and invigorate China's rural economy, the Shanghai Tea Export Industry Association intends to request the Four Joint Offices to appropriately relax tea loan quotas to facilitate turnover. Tang Jishan presided over a reception for reporters from various newspapers at 3 pm yesterday (17th) on the tenth floor of Wing On, explaining the importance of the issue and hoping that the press would provide strong support. In addition to submitting a telegram to the relevant authorities on the 15th, stating the whole story, the association has also scheduled to send representatives next week to visit President Yu of the National Bank, and possibly go to Nanjing to petition. During the reception, Tang said that if Chinese tea does not quickly catch up in international trade, it is feared that it will decline daily. A look at the world tea production and sales figures published by the American Tea Association reveals the overview. For example, last year, England, America, Canada, and Australia purchased 535 million pounds of black tea from Ceylon and India. Of these, England purchased 370 million pounds, Canada 44 million pounds, America 71 million pounds, and Australia 50 million pounds. In contrast, China exported only 30 million pounds of black and green tea last year. Black tea accounted for one-third of this, a vast difference compared to Ceylon and India. If we calculate China's total output, it can reach 1 million dan per year, which is 110 million pounds. Therefore, only three-elevenths of sales are achieved. It is regrettable that goods are abandoned in the fields and large amounts of foreign exchange have not been earned. Sun Xiaocun reported the actual cost of tea. He claimed: If we only consider the production cost of tea in the Pingshui area, the cost of raw tea on the mountain, as well as the materials, factory rent, packaging, labor, and porterage, are all converted based on the price of rice. This year, the purchase price of raw tea per dan is equivalent to two stones of rice, while the cost of processing and packaging of boxed tea per dan is approximately equivalent to one stone and six dou of rice. The transportation cost from the production area to Shanghai, the export location, is equivalent to four dou of rice. All transportation, storage, loss, warehouse rent, insurance, and other costs after arriving in Shanghai are equivalent to four dou of rice. Furthermore, there are 45 days from the collection of raw materials to the processing of boxed tea to the export date to Shanghai, and another month for the mortgage of boxed tea at the export location, totaling 75 days. The loan interest and high interest rates borne by the self-funded portion are approximately equivalent to two stones of rice. Based on these few items, the estimated cost of tea per dan is approximately equivalent to six stones and four dou of rice. According to the government's highest tea loan amount of 10 million yuan per bundle, it is only equivalent to a few dou of rice, less than one-tenth of the cost. At this point, Sun strongly emphasized that if the tea loan amount cannot be increased, not only will production be stifled, but there will also be many misunderstandings in the international market, as the low loan amount makes it appear that the cost is not high, and it is impossible to sell at high prices overseas. Finally, Ye Shichang and Song Qifan spoke successively. Ye compared tea prices over the years, such as 1 billion capital could purchase 3,500 dan of tea in the 35th year, but last year it was reduced to 1,000 dan. This year, although there is 50 billion capital, it can only purchase 200 dan, demonstrating the vastness of the funds needed by tea merchants. Song reported on the current international market. The meeting dispersed at approximately 4 pm.

### Kunming Student Unrest Resolved Satisfactorily: Authorities Handling Aftermath

### Visiting Jiaotong University: Acting President's Transfer Date Still to be Determined

[Our Newspaper] Due to Mr. Li Zhaohuan's firm refusal to take office as President of National Jiaotong University, the Ministry of Education has appointed Wang Zhizhuo, Dean of the Engineering College, as acting president in the interim. Meanwhile, the Ministry and university alumni are still urging Mr. Li to assume the position as soon as possible. The Student Union recently sent three representatives with an official letter to his residence, urging him to come to the university to oversee affairs. However, all three attempts to meet with him were unsuccessful. Furthermore, a reporter interviewed Dean Wang Zhizhuo yesterday. According to him, although the Ministry of Education has announced his temporary appointment as acting president, he has not yet officially taken office. President Cheng Xiao left the university two weeks ago, and the date for the handover is yet to be negotiated and decided. At that time, the Ministry of Education will be requested to send personnel to Shanghai to supervise the transfer. The graduation ceremony for this year may not be held, as the ceremony is traditionally held before the vacation, and now that the vacation has already begun, some graduating students have already left the university. Therefore, whether or not to hold the ceremony is still under discussion with the professors. Contracts for the professors for the next semester will be issued after officially taking office. Regarding rumors circulating that the university is experiencing internal unrest due to the president's issue, Dean Wang stated that this is not the case. Currently, university affairs are being handled by the three departments of student affairs, academic affairs, and general affairs, and the university's operations are not affected.

[Our Newspaper] The deadline for applications for new student admissions to Jiaotong University was yesterday, with an estimated total of over 7,000 applicants. The examination period will be from the 24th to the 28th of this month. Approximately 500 students will be admitted.

### Private Schools Not Yet Registered: Requesting Special Price Rice for Employees: Director Li's Request Submitted to the Mayor for Approval

[Dahua News Agency] The Municipal Food Allocation Committee distributes special food rice to faculty and staff of private primary, secondary, and higher education schools, according to Article 37 of the implementation regulations, which is limited to those that have been officially registered. However, school registration requires three steps: "School Board Registration," "School Opening Approved," and "School Registration," which takes at least a year. Therefore, over 300 schools in this city have not completed the registration process. Since the announcement of these regulations, teachers in these schools have been affected in terms of rice allocation, and they have been requesting assistance from the Private Primary and Secondary School Association, etc. It is reported that yesterday morning (17th), Jiang Jizhou, Yan Guodong, Wang Weiqun, Wang Bing, Wang Jincheng, and others negotiated with Ren Xianqun of the Allocation Committee, and have obtained his agreement. However, it still requires Director Li of the Education Bureau to submit a request to the Mayor for approval. Furthermore, it is understood that Director Li has already submitted a request to the Mayor with the details. If accommodation is not possible, whether it can be limited to schools that have "School Opening Approved" will also depend on the City Government's decision.

Jiaotong University Allows Accommodation for Candidates

General impoverished candidates do not have money to stay in hotels, and some have to sleep in parks or small teahouses near schools with bedding.

### University Special Interview Three: Private Guanghua University

School History Overview: On June 3, 1925, nineteen Chinese faculty members and 553 students from St. John's University, due to the patriotic movement, left the school and jointly planned to establish their own university. Mr. Wang Shengshan generously donated over sixty acres of land on Daxilu Road in Shanghai as the school's foundation. Mr. Zhang Yongni and Mr. Zhu Jingnong raised funds and planned the curriculum.

School opened on September 7th, with former St. John's students returning and new students rising up, and the university, established to reclaim educational rights, was thus established. Zhang Yongni was elected president, and Zhu Jingnong was elected provost. Four departments were established: liberal arts, sciences, commerce, and engineering. The following spring, construction of the school buildings began, and they were completed in the fall, with the university department moving in first. On June 1, 1929, the Ministry of Education approved its registration. In the fall of that year, in accordance with the organizational structure of universities promulgated by the Ministry, it was reorganized into three colleges: liberal arts, sciences, and commerce. In the spring of 1930, it began admitting female students.

Tenth Anniversary: In 1935, the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the school coincided with President Zhang's sixtieth birthday. Teachers, students, alumni, and enthusiastic people from all walks of life gathered large sums of money to build new school buildings to commemorate the occasion. There was a self-drilled artesian well, a self-provided power plant, and a sanatorium donated by the student association. The school's foundation was expanded to hundreds of acres. In 1937, the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and the school buildings were completely destroyed by the enemy on November 12th and 13th. Upon hearing the news, President Zhang personally stood by the Daxilu Railway and looked out at the flames, weeping for a long time. The school moved to a road-building area beyond the border, and then moved into the concession, continuing classes as usual. In 1938, Xie Lin, Dean of the College of Commerce, completed preparations for a branch school in Sichuan and opened it in Chengdu. The Sichuan Provincial Government and gentry merchants either allocated funds to subsidize construction costs or donated school land.

Difficult Times: In the fall of 1941, the Pacific War suddenly broke out. President Zhang knew that the enemy would intensify the pressure, so he decided to officially suspend the Shanghai school. On one hand, the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and the heads of various departments organized a committee, and publicly elected Jiang Zhuzhuang, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts, to preside over the "Chengzheng Literary Society." The Deans of the Colleges of Science and Commerce and the heads of various departments organized a committee, and publicly elected Tang Qingzeng, Head of the Department of Economics, to preside over the "Gezhi Science and Commerce Society." The main faculty and staff of the affiliated high school organized a committee, and publicly elected Wu Xialing to preside over the "Renwu Tutoring Society." The three societies were registered with the Ministry of Education, and everything was handled in accordance with the Ministry's orders. Because there was no public recruitment, the number of students decreased year by year, and finances fell into dire straits. President Zhang, worried about the times and overworked, passed away in Shanghai on the 27th before the victory.

Before and After Reestablishment: When the Japanese invaders surrendered, Zhang Xinglian and Zhang Zhilian, sons of the late President Zhang, invited Vice President Zhu Jingnong and the main faculty and staff of the three societies to discuss the reestablishment of the school. Vice President Zhu was publicly elected as acting president. The school was officially reestablished in the Securities Building, and classes began on schedule. The board of directors was reorganized, and Weng Wenhao was publicly elected as chairman. The board of directors decided to return the branch school donated by the people of Sichuan to the people of Sichuan, renaming it "Chenghua University," and appointed Zhu Jingnong and Liao Maoru as presidents of the university and middle school respectively. On one hand, permission was obtained from the Ministry of Education to allocate the enemy property at Nos. 221 and 222 Ouyang Road, Hongkou, as school buildings and to move in for classes. President Zhu also resigned from his position as Vice Minister of Education and officially took office at the school.

Dean and Department Heads: Currently, the Deans and Department Heads of the various colleges and departments of the school are as follows: Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and concurrently Head of the Department of Chinese Literature Jiang Zhuzhuang, Head of the Department of Foreign Languages Zhou Xuliang, Head of the Department of Education Sun Guiding, Head of the Department of History Lu Simian, Head of the Department of Law Guo Yunquan, Head of the Department of Political Science Geng Danru, Head of the Department of Sociology Hu Zuyin. Dean of the College of Science Rong Qizhao, Head of the Department of Chemistry Shen Zhaowen, Head of the Department of Biology Wang Zhijia (Honorary Professor Bing Nongshan), Head of the Department of Mathematics and Physics Zhu Gongjin, Head of the Department of Civil Engineering Zhu Yongnian. Dean of the College of Commerce Cen Dezhang, Head of the Department of Economics Tang Qingzeng, Head of the Department of Accounting Xue Difu, Head of the Department of Banking He Yichao, Head of the Department of Business Administration Cai Zhengzhi.

### Lin Da School Building Funds Largely Resolved: Tian Peilin Returns to Nanjing to Report: All Students of Shanxi University Arrive in Beiping

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 17th] Vice Minister of Education Tian Peilin came to Beiping to handle the problems of Northeast Lin Da and Lin Zhong. The funds for the school buildings have been largely resolved. He will fly to Nanjing at 11:00 am today to report.

[Central News Agency Beiping, 17th] Chen Kefu, Director of the Preparatory Office of Northeast Lin Da, told reporters that a total of 2,420 people from the four national universities in the Northeast have registered for Lin Da. Lin Da has now received 41.4 billion yuan in subsidies from the Ministry of Education and will first manufacture 1,500 bed boards and desks. Northeast University will manufacture 1,000, for a total of 2,500. Furthermore, it is learned that Changchun University will temporarily move from Changchun to Shenyang. A small number of students who came to Beiping will be accommodated by Lin Da.

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 17th] All students of Shanxi University can arrive in Beiping today. Because the school has not been approved to relocate, the school is taking a laissez-faire attitude, and all students are taking care of themselves. They used 40 million yuan of membership fees this month to partially buy plane tickets to fly here. Vice Minister Tian Peilin said: "Now that they are here, we can't ignore them." The Beiping authorities have agreed to follow the example of Northeast students and provide temporary food and lodging. Two-thirds of the faculty and staff have also arrived in Beiping. The school has a total of 465 students, 80 of whom will graduate this year. The students have already contacted students from various schools in Beiping and are asking for support.

### Olympic Torch Departs: Lit in the Ancient Temple of Olympia: Following 3,000-Year-Old Traditions

[Reuters Athens, 17th] The Olympic torch is scheduled to be lit at noon on the 17th in the ruins of the ancient Temple of Hera in the ancient village of Olympia in southern Greece. At that time, the 3,000-year-old tradition will still be followed, with a Greek woman in white using olive branches under a magnifying glass to ignite the olive branches using the focus of sunlight, and then using the olive branches to light a cup-shaped oil lamp, and lighting the torch from the lamp. The lamp was originally stored in the Greek Archaeological Museum and will be sent to London after the torch is lit, where it will be presented to Princess Elizabeth by the Greek Olympic Committee. King Paul of Greece is currently touring the front lines and is unable to come to Olympia to participate in the lighting ceremony. The only people present are representatives of the Greek and British Olympic Committees. After the torch is lit, it will be relayed for 2,000 miles to Wembley, where it is scheduled to arrive on July 29th for the opening of the World Games. Due to the civil war, the first leg of the journey from Olympia to Katakolon Port will be shortened from 500 miles to 50 miles, from where it will be transported by the Greek destroyer Hastings to Corfu Island. On Sunday morning, Greek athletes from Corfu Island will hand it over to the British ship Whitesand Bay, which will sail to Bari, Italy, where it will be handed over to Italian athletes. In each country, the torch will be relayed by athletes from that country until it reaches Calais, France, where it will be handed over to the British destroyer Bicester for transport across the English Channel to Dover. Starting on the night of July 28th, 75 British athletes will each run two miles, and on the afternoon of the 29th, the torch will be relayed to Wembley, where the King of England will preside over the opening ceremony of the World Games.

[Our Newspaper] Athens, 17th Broadcast: The torch for the World Games was lit at 11:00 am this morning. Athletes, protected by armed guards, have begun their journey to London with the torch.

### Wrestling Exhibition: Third Competition Today

The Shanghai Wrestling Exhibition, organized by the Jingwu Athletic Association, will hold its third week of competition at the Association's venue on Yokohama Bridge this morning, with a total of 18 pairs. In the light welterweight class, Wang Binglin vs. Wang Wending. Although Binglin won the second match without any effort, he may be dealt a harsh blow this time when he meets Wending.

### Chinese Baseball Team: Today's Battle with Amateurs: 3:00 PM at the American School

[Our Newspaper] Riding on the momentum of defeating the US Army and Helena last week, the Chinese baseball team will face the Shanghai Amateur Baseball Association for the second time at 3:00 PM today at the American School on Hengshan Road. In the first game between the two teams a month ago, the Chinese team was at the beginning of the season, and its teamwork was not as tight as in recent games. Therefore, it was at a disadvantage in every inning. However, torrential rain poured down when the amateurs were about to win in the last few innings, and the game could not continue. According to the competition rules, the results of the innings that had already been played were all canceled, and the organizer decided to replay today. In recent games, the Chinese team has fully demonstrated that its individual performance and teamwork are both at their peak, and it should not repeat the mistakes of the first game. The Chinese team's lineup today is as follows:

Pitcher: Yu Changluan, First Base: Bao Guanda, Second Base: Liang Cheng Song, Third Base: Liang Youyou, Catcher: Cao Kejia, Left Fielder: Liang Youyi, Center Fielder: Zhong Baoluo, Right Fielder: Lu Zhaosen, Shortstop: Liang Youyi, Li Qiteng, He Jinben, Mei Yingjun, Wang Nianzi.

### Tuition Calculated in Rice Value?

— Ping Zhai

Today, the decline in the value of legal tender is an undeniable fact. However, no matter how low the value of legal tender falls, it is still the only legal currency in our country. Therefore, although there are many landlords in Shanghai who are unscrupulous and only want to calculate rent in gold bars or US dollars, they still dare not openly say in broad daylight that they do not want legal tender but want something other than legal tender.

Since the use of gold banknotes is a prohibited example, how can using "white rice" as a unit be considered legal!

However, rumors have been circulating recently that the tuition for some universities next semester will be five dan of rice, and some middle schools will be three dan of rice… A few days ago, a senior official of a certain university actually told reporters that the tuition for next semester will be calculated in rice value, saying that it will be five dan of medium-quality rice, and the words were quite certain, as if it were bound to happen.

If students live on campus and eat in the school, and the school, under the current special circumstances, asks students to hand over their household rice ration cards to the school, and the school charges students at the negotiated price for household rice every month, and the rice purchased is given to the students to eat, then it would be more understandable. However, if tuition and miscellaneous fees are all calculated in rice value, then whether parents can afford it is not the only question. What impact will this have on other industries? If the government allows schools to use something other than legal tender as a payment standard, then what if other industries follow suit? For example, if doctors charge two dou of medium-quality rice for each house call in the future, and cloth stores charge several sheng of medium-quality rice per foot when selling cloth, can the government still say that they are violating the law? At that time, if landlords calculate rent in dou or dan of rice, will it still be prohibited?

Of course, the lives of teachers in various schools are indeed extremely difficult at present, and we express our deepest sympathy. In all fairness, tuition should indeed be increased. However, calculating the value in rice is a very bad precedent that must not be set. The impact of this matter is enough to kill legal tender. This matter concerns the foundation of the country, and we ask teachers to think twice!

### Animal Languages

— Guo Ping

Animals also have their own languages. Many animals "converse" using something like Morse code, while others use gestures or movements to express what they want to say in their hearts.

When a worker bee finds a flower full of honey, she quickly flies back to the hive and begins to perform a whirling dance in the center of the hive, happily reporting the good news. This dance, like language, tells the other worker bees, and they line up and fly eagerly to the flower patch to collect honey.

When a rabbit receives alarming news, it goes to the other rabbits and desperately thumps the ground with its hind legs to tell them.

Zoologists have proven that when a male wolf obtains a lot of food that it cannot finish eating, it buries the remaining food in the ground. As it sniffs the soil, it leaves a special scent, and the other wolves can find the food by this scent, which replaces language.

The way a male fiddler crab courts a female is quite similar to that of humans. When it encounters a female crab, it raises its large claw and waves it to greet her. If the female crab approaches it, it dances on its tiptoes and makes many different gestures with its large claw to express its intentions.

The way hummingbirds communicate with the opposite sex is quite poetic. When a male hummingbird sees a female, it flutters its wings and circles, flying in an arc in front of her. When the female hummingbird shows a little attention, the male hummingbird becomes enthusiastic and flies higher and higher. Finally, it soars into the sky with a cry, flying to a height of sixty feet, then suddenly descends and dances in front of the female hummingbird to win her favor.

In the tropics, there is a type of tree ant. Their "conversation" between one tree and another is indicated by the speed and strength of the sound they make by knocking on the trunk. Although the sound of the ants' feet is so faint that the human ear cannot hear it, they can hear each other.

A cow "speaks" by wiggling its ears.

We can say that all animal languages cannot escape the use of movements, smells, or faint sounds inaudible to the human ear. Some zoologists believe that this is what is called "Telepathy," but some experts believe that human senses are too dull to hear their "voices." Which is right and which is wrong remains to be proven by science in the future.

### "My Brother" and "Benevolent Brother"

— You Mojun

"My Brother" and "Benevolent Brother" are common and frequently seen terms of address in letters. The usage of the two is slightly different: "Benevolent Brother" should be used to be more polite; conversely, if they are closer, then "My Brother" is often used. What I want to discuss now is the writing of the two characters "My Brother". According to our country's writing method, there is something called "jumping out", that is, commonly known as "raising the head," so as to express respect. "Brother" is a respectful term, so it should be written "jumping out", there is no doubt about it; but now, when writing, the character "My" is separated from the character "Brother", that is, the character "My" does not need to raise its head. This point is quite debatable.

The Preface to the Holy Teachings of the Monk Huai Ren Collected from Wang Xizhi's Writings and the Inscription of the Liquan Spring by Ouyang Xun are both commonly used posts for our calligraphy practice. In the sentence "My Emperor's blessings arrive" in the Preface to the Holy Teachings, the character "My" is written "jumping out"; in the sentence "My Queen firmly holds and moderates" and "My Queen is cautious in the evening" in the Inscription of the Liquan Spring, the two "My" characters are also written with their heads raised. The reason why the character "My" is written "jumping out" is because it is a term of close respect, not a self-designation of a subject; in the midst of respect, there is a sense of intimacy, and the writing is extremely appropriate. In the letters of modern people, when addressing "My Brother", the character "My" is forcibly split apart. People are accustomed to it and do not know that it is wrong. One can only say that it does not conform to the "ancient".

The title "Benevolent Brother" is indeed "ancient". The Biography of Zhao Yi in the Book of the Later Han Dynasty records a sentence in a letter answering Huangfu Gui: "I sincerely hope that Benevolent Brother will reveal his long delay." So this title already existed in the Han Dynasty.

### Ancient Meaning

— Bi

Your home is at the head of Wu River, my home is in the outer city of Jinling, I always remember touring Jiangnan, and we were happy.

In Jiangnan, the lotus seeds can be picked, the lotus well is red and bright, picking lotus seeds and not picking lotus leaves, the leaves are a mandarin duck curtain.

On the curtain, the autumn wind is born, under the dew, the green branches fall, when the branches fall, the silk is still connected, when the person leaves, the heart is entrusted.

Entrusting each other, the river water is long, seeing each other off, the wind and waves are evil, one word to give to you, the heart is bitter and difficult to make medicine!

Second

Leisurely white clouds gallop, dimly flying crows pass by, the birds pass by and still leave sound, the clouds leave and do not look back.

Looking back is also difficult to see, seeing each other is in dreams, dense rain falls and forms a river, in which there are tears in dreams.

What if the tears run out! Blood drips onto the soil under the steps. Take the soil and make a plate, make it your rouge mansion.

Look at the red on your cheeks in the morning, and as red on your cheeks in the evening, morning after morning and evening after evening, I only see a good complexion.

### "Grabbing a Seat"

— Yi Jun

I have played many games at various social gatherings at school, and "grabbing a seat" is one of them. The way this game is played is this: arrange the seats in a circle. Assuming there are twenty people participating, there will only be nineteen or eighteen seats. When the whistle blows, everyone leaves their seat. When the whistle blows again, everyone grabs a seat to sit in. As a result, of course, one or two people will definitely not be able to grab a seat.

The job-seeking phenomenon in society now is simply like the game of "grabbing a seat." The number of "seats" in society is very limited and has already been fully occupied. There are still many people waiting beside them; graduates from schools come out, running around and getting frustrated, getting their heads broken and bleeding. If they want to grab an empty seat, they must have great skills, so most people cannot get a seat.

The game of "grabbing a seat" is, after all, a game; if you can't grab a seat, you just stand for a while. To be more harsh, you just have to sing a song or tell a joke, so that "everyone is happy," which is a pleasure. But "grabbing a seat" when looking for a job is not fun. If you can't grab a seat, you will be punished to perform "being a Yangmei," making you unable to support your parents and unable to raise your wife and children, causing pain to your loved ones and making your enemies happy.

In the game of "grabbing a seat", there is only one seat missing, at most two, so only a few one or two people cannot grab a seat; but when looking for a job, there are too many seats missing, and there are very few empty seats, so most people cannot grab a seat, and most of them. In the game of "grabbing a seat", the number of people does not increase, but in "grabbing a seat"-style job seeking, the number of people increases in large numbers year after year. The fewer the seats, the more new opponents increase, the more difficult it is to grab a seat.

Sometimes when you ask someone to recommend you for a job, they say, "Wait for an opportunity!" The meaning is: wait for an empty seat! But you are not the only one waiting for this seat to be empty, so even if God helps you, only one of you can grab the seat that you are all waiting for, and the rest will inevitably wait in vain. What's worse, the seat you're waiting for may not even become empty, so you can't grab it either. I have had such experiences several times from Jing'an Temple to the end of North Sichuan Road by tram: when I got on the tram, I didn't grab a seat, so I stood by a person who was sitting, preparing to replace him when he got off halfway, but after passing many stations along the way, seats on the left and right were emptied and grabbed by others, but only the person whose seat I was waiting for firmly held his seat and did not move until he got off at the end of North Sichuan Road. As a result, I waited in vain. The same is true when looking for a job, but the danger is even greater.

"Grabbing a seat" in a game is just grabbing an empty seat. If you can't grab it, you just give up. But in the job-seeking situation, it's not that simple. When grabbing, there is inevitably a fierce battle. After grabbing, those who can't grab a seat may squeeze those "occupied seats", so those who squeeze and those who are squeezed will inevitably fight in a group, twist into a pile, fight a big battle, and harm each other, and evolve into the so-called "man-made disaster".

There are two major problems in society today: one is the price problem, and the other is the "seat" problem; when prices stop rising and no one is grabbing for seats, there will probably be no more serious problems.

### Miscellaneous Talks on Couplets

— Jianqiu

The creation of couplets can be either magnificent or delicate. Although the approaches are different, neither should be neglected. Here are a few examples to substantiate this discussion.

Mr. Han Guojun's couplet mourning his second son reads: "To despise one's own life and cause sorrow to one's parents is called unfilial; having mourned your brother, now I see your death, what home do I have?" Each word is a tear, making it unbearable to finish reading. His son indulged in pleasure and extravagance, and one night, he was careless with wine, fell from a building, and died. Master Zi cried bitterly, and his true feelings were revealed, so he was unaware of his grief.

The Ping Shan Tang in Yangzhou has a couplet collected from the works of Song Dynasty writers: "Embracing distant mountains and swallowing the Yangtze River (Fan Zhongyan), among the southwestern peaks, the forests and valleys are especially beautiful (Ouyang Xiu); Sending off the setting sun and welcoming the bright moon (Wang Yuzhi), at the turn of spring and summer, the grass and trees reach the sky (Su Shi)." It is casually picked up and perfectly seamless. It is a fine structure, as the saying goes, "a robe patched with a thousand armpits, obliterating all traces of thread."

The couplet for the "Autumn Moon over the Peaceful Lake" in West Lake reads: "Coming through the curtains, the clear wind in summer and the sun in winter; Seeing each other with rolled up curtains, the bright moon in front and the mountains behind." It deliberately repeats, but it does not feel redundant. It also shows wisdom.

### Stories Inspired by the Yan Peixing Case

— Diao Ying

The Yan Peixing case has suddenly become silent and without substance, and everyone is inexplicably confused as to whether he is really crazy. A story recorded in an American magazine is somewhat similar to the Yan case:

There was an American businessman who was old but married a young and beautiful wife. The wealthy businessman suspected his wife of infidelity, but she flatly denied it. One day, the wealthy businessman was extremely busy with business affairs and was exhausted when he returned home. Unexpectedly, his wife brought in a doctor, insisted that he was in poor health, and wanted him to have a blood test. As soon as the doctor performed the operation, the wealthy businessman fainted.

When he woke up, he was in a private mental hospital, not allowed to see visitors. He argued to get out, but the hospital ignored him. He was locked up for twenty-seven months in a row!

But the wealthy businessman's nephew became suspicious. He hired a lawyer to go to the mental hospital and ask to see the businessman. Unexpectedly, he went more than fifty times and still could not see him. The lawyer was filled with righteous indignation, so he asked a political figure for help. Unexpectedly, the hospital still ignored him when the political figure went. Finally, they took a court summons to "summon" the "madman," and only then did they finally meet him—of course, the "madman" had only been given an anesthetic injection that day, and had no mental illness at all!

As a result, it was found that the director of the mental hospital and the doctor had both been bribed, and the wealthy businessman's wife's intentions were naturally revealed. They were all sentenced to the crimes they deserved. This type of criminal case is actually quite common. When sentencing, the doctor's crime is often the most serious (because he insisted that a perfectly healthy person had a mental illness), and the fines often exceed $10,000.

### Guangdong and Guangxi

— Gongsun Wu

Someone asked a Cantonese person, what is the meaning of "Guang" in Guangdong and Guangxi? It is easy to understand Hunan and Hubei, Shandong and Shanxi. The Cantonese person did not know how to answer. I said to him, why not ask back about the origin of Jiangxi's name? Try to look at a map. The entire Jiangxi province is indeed south of the great river. Both matters are easy to understand. Gu Yanwu's Daily Knowledge Records explains the reason, saying, "In the twenty-first year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang Dynasty, the world was divided into fifteen circuits, and Jiangnan was divided into two circuits, Jiangnan East Circuit governed Suzhou, and Jiangnan West Circuit governed Hongzhou. Later generations simplified the writing and only called them Jiangdong and Jiangxi." Today, the name Jiangdong has been abandoned. Elementary school textbooks say that Jiangsu Province is named after the old Jiangning and Suzhou. As for Guangdong and Guangxi, Gu said, "The Guangdong and Guangxi of today are also the simplified names of Guangnan East Circuit and Guangnan West Circuit. Wenxian Tongkao says that in the third year of the Zhidao era of Emperor Taizong, the world was divided into fifteen circuits, and later three circuits were added. The seventeenth was Guangnan East Circuit, and the eighteenth was Guangnan West Circuit." This is also exam material and should be printed in exam guides and other materials.

Brother Jingzhai wrote: Ying Guoboyue, together with Mr. Canweng and Mr. Qian, went to Suzhou to survey Feng Shui. He also said that Mr. Banmeng used his fortune telling to predict that his life would end at sixty-eight years old, which is this year, Wuzi, and he intends to enter the mountains to seek supreme bliss and write a poem to bid farewell to his colleagues. Jingzhai's reply chapter has the line (Why bother to ask for longevity in the Zinian year? Living in a clean studio far away is enough for a sound sleep). According to general precedents, a twilight mood is either for self-entertainment in one's old age or for arranging one's affairs after death, all of which are common sense. Most of the wise men of the past were like this. However, astrologers often calculate the flowing years and take the ages around seventy as the norm for dealing with worldly affairs. Moreover, there are alarming words that cannot be verified. For example, in the chronicle poem of Zhou Guanyu, Yu Shanfu of Jiande (the Viceroy of Liangjiang in the 31st and 2nd year of the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty), which records his fifty-second year, Wuzi, when he returned to Zheng from his post as Judge of Zhili to visit his relatives, he wrote a poem saying: "The fortune teller said that I would live to seventy-two years old, and at noon on the twenty-fourth of April, I would bid farewell to the world. How dare I believe these words? Longevity and brevity are all destined. I lament my meager talents, and I only bear the burden of wasting time. I have no intention of pursuing fame and fortune, and nine out of ten things are hindered. What is the use of living twenty more years?" He also said: "I am not yet called an old man at fifty, and the vicissitudes of life are like a reversal. I sigh that my books have been presented repeatedly, and my ambition to retire has not been realized. I dare not covet glory and profit, and I know enough to maintain loyalty and honesty. I vow to return as a senior scholar when I reach the Jiawu year." When he wrote the poem, he considered seventy as "living twenty more years", and he was content with retiring at sixty. Who would have thought that this old gentleman would live to eighty-five years old and pass away in his residence in Tianjin in the tenth year of the Republic of China (Xinyou), more than ten years beyond the number calculated by the fortune teller! Then, are the so-called predictions of passing away on a certain day, month, year, and time all old rumors? Old Zhou's collection of poems is a chronicle of events, all expressed in poetry, so it is a "poetic chronicle". By the time of Yi Si (the first year of the Xuantong era of the Qing Dynasty), there was a title "The Night of April 24th", with a footnote saying: "In the past, a fortune teller said that I would pass away at the age of seventy-two, at noon on the twenty-fourth of April. It was not verified last year, Wushen, and I was worried that this year, Jiyou, I would reach my full term. So I made a playful inscription at night and wrote a poem: "The white egret has already been met and has not stopped its whip, Heaven has given me Qingguan and more years. In my dreams, the vicissitudes of life have changed through thousands of kalpas, and a star hangs in the remaining clouds and mists of the night. Ruan Fu will light the wax to visit the mountains, and Tao Ling still ploughs and plants fields. The grass laughs at the old man for having no desires, and he wants to bathe in the river and become an immortal." He is also doing his best to enjoy his old age, which is the immortal of this world. Is there really a Zhong Lü who can save people? Old Zhou is a truly enlightened man. (Old Zhou's previous work was in Wuzi, which is the 14th year of the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty. Banmeng felt the same and wrote the same poem this year, Wuzi, which is also a coincidence.) Zhou's fourth son, Zhou Xuezhao, whose courtesy name is Jizhi, was a Juren in the Gui Si year. He was promoted by the old Yuan in the Qing Dynasty and served as the Director-General of Transport in the Changlu Salt District. In the early years of the Republic of China, he was the Minister of Finance of the Yuan government and was highly trusted. After retiring, he engaged in industry and commerce in Tianjin. In the year before the victory, he and his wife celebrated their eightieth birthdays together and wrote poems to celebrate their golden wedding (60 years of marriage). Last year, his wife passed away first, and a few months later, Jizhi followed her, returning with white hair, and both he and his father were blessed with longevity.
