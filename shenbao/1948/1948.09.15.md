### Import Quota for the Seventh and Eighth Quarters Reduced by Nearly 20 Million US Dollars; To Be Reported to the Executive Yuan Meeting and Then Announced; Exchange Rate for British Pounds and French Francs to Be Considered After Agreement is Reached

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The Economic Control Committee of the Executive Yuan held its fourth meeting at 4 PM on the 14th at the No. 1 official residence of the Executive Yuan. Committee members present included Wang Yunwu, Yu Hongjun, Chen Qitian, and Secretary-General Xu Baiyuan. Yu Dawei, Guan Jiyu, Sun Yueqi, Gu Zhenggang, and Li Weiguo, heads of relevant ministries and commissions, also attended. The meeting was personally presided over by Weng Wenhao, who also served as the chairman. First, the secretariat reported on the implementation of price controls and financial management in various regions. Then, Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian reported on the supply and pricing of coal. The meeting then proceeded to discuss (1) the import quota for the seventh and eighth quarters; (2) the issue of exchanging British pounds and other foreign currencies. According to the Ministry of Finance's report, the Central Bank is currently studying this issue. Except for US dollars, Hong Kong dollars, and Philippine pesos, which can be exchanged for gold yuan at the Central Bank, holders of British pounds, French francs, and rubles can first deposit them in the Central Bank or its entrusted banks, which will store and manage them on behalf of the holders. The Central Bank will issue storage certificates. After the Central Bank reaches an agreement with Britain, France, and other countries on the exchange rate in the future, the currencies can be exchanged or used to purchase raw materials that are permitted for import. (3) Regarding the food supply issue, the rationing system for major cities will be reconsidered. In particular, the preferential treatment given to wealthy households in large cities with the ability to obtain rations should be reconsidered and improved. Guan Jiyu reported at the meeting that the food supply situation in various cities is very good, and the sources of grain in various regions have become abundant after the new grain has been harvested.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The import quota list for the seventh and eighth quarters has been approved at the meeting of the Economic Control Committee of the Executive Yuan on the afternoon of the 14th. It will be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting on the 15th for a report and then announced in the afternoon. The import quota list for the seventh and eighth quarters approved by the Economic Control Committee on the 14th is based on Article 9, Paragraph 1 of the "Measures for Consolidating Finances and Strengthening Economic Control," and has been reduced by more than one-quarter compared to the average standard of the fifth and sixth quarters. The total import quota for the fifth and sixth quarters was 73,476,000 US dollars, while the total amount for the seventh and eighth quarters is only over 50 million US dollars, a decrease of nearly 20 million US dollars. The compilation of this quota list is purely to save the country's foreign exchange, and it adopts a combined compilation method, which is the same as the intention of the combined compilation of the fifth and sixth quarters. The list of items listed in Appendix (2) of the quota list has been reduced from 21 items in the fifth and sixth quarters to 19 items in the seventh and eighth quarters. The originally listed truck and automobile items have been deleted to avoid increasing gasoline consumption. The import of other items has been generally reduced by 25%. In addition to approving the detailed numbers of the quota list at the meeting, the following three points were also decided: (1) For machinery, industrial accessories, and industrial raw materials that domestic manufacturers have ordered abroad before August 19 and are permitted to import, the Export Control Committee will be responsible for formulating measures to register them on a regular basis and allow them to apply for import. (2) For foreign merchants in China, if they use their own funds to purchase machinery and parts from abroad that are indeed for private assembly and use, they may be allowed to import them on a regular basis. (3) The import of 500 to 600 automobiles by foreign merchants will be handled separately.

### Review of Compensation Standards for Pre-War Deposits and Loans in the Banking Industry; The Legislative Yuan Passes a Resolution Urging the Speedy Establishment of Hainan Province; The "July 5th" Provisional Martial Law Case in Peiping is Not Ratified

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The second meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 14th. After the meeting was presided over by President Sun at 9:30 AM, the reporting items were first conducted. In addition to passing the minutes of the first meeting and resolving to reject the Executive Yuan's request for ratification of the temporary martial law declared in the Peiping area on July 5th, 17 cases submitted by the Executive Yuan and the Examination Yuan were also processed. Then, the discussion items began: The first case was the report of the review of the draft Military Pension Regulations by the National Defense Committee and the Legal System Committee of the Legislative Yuan. Because the content of the draft needs to be changed again after the currency reform, the Ministry of National Defense stated in a letter, it was decided to postpone the discussion until it is revised and reviewed again. The second case was the proposal by Kong Geng and others "to re-examine and revise the compensation standards for pre-war deposits and loans in the banking industry, which were approved by the previous Legislative Yuan, in order to be fair, alleviate public resentment, completely end this case, and avoid causing trouble." It was resolved to hand it over to the Civil Law Committee and the Financial and Economic Committee for joint review, and the meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM.

The fourth case was the proposal by Zhang Qingzhen and others to urge the Executive Yuan to formulate and implement detailed measures for the registration and management of foreign exchange assets deposited abroad by Chinese citizens, in order to effectively implement the proposal, which was resolved to be handed over to the Financial and Economic Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee for joint review. The fifth case was the report of the joint review by the Internal Affairs and Local Autonomy Committee and the National Defense Committee of the proposal by Wang Jun and others to urge the government to implement the resolution and quickly change Hainan Island into a province, which was resolved to pass the "Hainan Island Province Change Case should be implemented immediately" according to the review opinions. The sixth case was the joint review by the Grain Administration Committee and the Financial and Economic Committee of the three proposals related to grain administration proposed by Sun Xiangfeng and others, Liu Yunzhao and others, and Qu Zhisheng and others, which was resolved to be passed according to the review opinions. Except for the Qu case, which involves a major change in grain policy due to the establishment of a grain depot system, which needs to be discussed at length during this session, the Sun and Liu cases are combined and decided on two points: "(1) The purchase of county-level grain taxes should be paid monthly at the market price from the time of ordering, and the funds should be allocated before the 10th of each month, and the allocation procedures should be simplified as much as possible. The detailed measures shall be decided by the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Finance, and the National Treasury Bureau through consultation. (2) The transportation of purchased grain taxes shall be the responsibility of the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of National Defense." The seventh case was the proposal by Niu Jianchu and others that land reform policies in pacification areas and non-pacification areas should be implemented simultaneously and universally in order to conform to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy of equalizing land ownership and benefit the suppression of rebellion and nation-building cause, which was resolved to be handed over to the Land Administration Committee and the Legal System Committee for joint review and to be merged with the "Land Handling Regulations for Pacification Areas" submitted by the Executive Yuan. By 6:00 PM, all the agenda items were completed, and the adjournment was announced.

### Adding Alcohol to Vehicle Fuel; To Be Piloted in Shanghai First

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 10th] In order to save gasoline, the Executive Yuan recently convened the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Transportation Control Committee, and the China Petroleum Corporation and other agencies to discuss the oil material control and adjustment plan. At the meeting, many attendees suggested that vehicles use fuel mixed with alcohol due to the insufficient supply of imported fuel. The meeting decided that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Resources Commission should jointly discuss the technical issues. Now the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has invited relevant ministries to discuss, and the result has been decided to mix alcohol with automobile fuel, which will be piloted in Shanghai first. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce will submit it to the Executive Yuan and then to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedure for mixing alcohol with automobile fuel.

### The Legislative Yuan Exercises the Power of Veto; The Discussion on the "July 5th" Martial Law Case Was Heated

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The Legislative Yuan exercised the power of veto granted by the Constitution for the first time on the morning of the 14th, refusing to ratify President's July 26th request for ratification of the July 5th Peiping martial law case. The first reporting case listed on today's meeting agenda was: "The President consults on the declaration of temporary martial law in the Peiping area from 7:00 PM on the 5th of this month (July 5th), please review and ratify the case." President Sun suggested that after all the reporting cases have been read, the discussion should be conducted directly in accordance with Article 8 of the Legislative Yuan Organization Law. Wang Hansheng, a legislator from Songjiang Province, spoke first. Based on the investigation report of Supervisory Committee members Gu Fengxiang and Hu Wenhui, he pointed out that the reasons for the temporary martial law listed in the report form of the Ministry of National Defense and the original telegram of Fu Zuoyi did not match the facts. The Supervisory Yuan is planning to exercise its powers over the government's measures to handle the July 5th incident. If the Legislative Yuan ratifies it, it is tantamount to admitting that the government's measures are legitimate. According to the provisions of the Constitution, the President has the power to declare martial law, but the power of ratification rests with the Legislative Yuan. If the Legislative Yuan ratifies it without asking the details, it is tantamount to abandoning its power and neglecting its duties. Wang's speech immediately received applause. Then, Liu Zhendong, Huang Yuren, Sun Guiji, Cheng Tianfang, Liu Minghou, Zhang Qianhua and others spoke in succession, either proposing that the case be reserved, or proposing to change the agenda, and wait for the Supervisory Yuan to make a decision on the July 5th incident before discussing it again, but the majority advocated that the decision on whether or not to ratify it should be made immediately based on facts and law. After an hour of heated discussion, President Sun asked for the consent of the attendees to first vote on whether to send it to the review. As a result, among the 306 committee members present, 121 opposed it, and 108 supported it, neither of which exceeded half of the votes. At this point, the vote was taken again on whether to ratify it. As a result, only two people voted in favor of ratification, and another person raised his hand between yes and no. President Sun declared: "The President consulted on the declaration of temporary martial law in the Peiping area from July 5th, please review and ratify the case, the resolution is not to ratify it." This topic ended amidst applause.

[Another Dispatch] An authoritative source said: The "July 5th" martial law measure in Peiping was decided by the Peiping Garrison Headquarters and approved by the Executive Yuan meeting. The President only submitted the report from the Executive Yuan to the Legislative Yuan for review and ratification. Now that the Legislative Yuan has refused to ratify it because the reasons for the measure are insufficient, the President will naturally report it back and order the Executive Yuan to re-examine and handle it. Whether the martial law measure is inappropriate, or whether the officials who decided and implemented the measure will be subject to administrative punishment, still depends on whether the Supervisory Yuan decides to exercise its power of correction and impeachment. The Legislative Yuan's decision not to ratify the measure means that it cannot obtain a legal basis before the Supervisory Yuan decides what steps to take.

### At the Welcome Meeting of Peiping City Councilors; Zhang Lisheng Spoke Eloquently; Discussing His Personality and Style, He Admitted to Being Weak; Learning from Muhammad, He Held a Sword in One Hand

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 14th] Zhang Lisheng spoke eloquently at the welcome meeting of Peiping City Councilors on the 14th, discussing his personality and style. Because City Councilor Shen Chengqing accused Zhang of being too kind in guiding the financial and economic reforms in the north, and not approaching the people much. He pointed out that Zhang's statement that Peiping and Tianjin are different from Shanghai and do not need to be too strict is unclear responsibility, and hoped that Zhang would review the past and encourage the future. Zhang solemnly replied to this, saying: Most people today are flattering, and such loyal words are rarely seen even between teachers and friends, and he will never forget them in his life. He continued: I dare not say that I am kind, I can only say that I am weak. The reason why I cannot be brave is because I cannot be kind. Wisdom, benevolence, and courage are the three great virtues. The reason why "wisdom" comes first is that it is valuable to know before acting. As the saying goes, "Heavy punishment is used to govern a chaotic world." I don't want to say more about this kind of imperial privilege. Today, we want democracy. The government cannot abuse its power and should punish according to the law. I am a northerner, and I know that Peiping and Tianjin have been exploited by the enemy and puppets for eight years. There are indeed some rich people, but most people are suffering from poverty. If we act rashly, it will not be good. Hating evil is my nature, but I can only learn from Muhammad, holding the Quran in one hand and a sword in the other. Zhang also told reporters before leaving that today's situation is rare, and I hope you will write more.

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 14th] Peiping City Councilors held a tea party today to welcome Zhang Lisheng, and Mayor Liu and others accompanied him.

Editorial

### Responding to the National Construction Through Thrift and Diligence Movement

The ancients said that thrift and diligence build a family. From establishing a family and starting a career to governing a country and prospering a nation, everything starts with these two words. Diligence means working hard, and thrift means abstaining from waste. The purpose of diligence is to increase income, and the effect of thrift is to reduce expenditure. With both root and branch addressed, and simultaneous efforts on both the active and passive fronts, how can a family be not well-managed, and a country not thrive?

However, since the opening of sea routes, extravagant Western customs have gradually spread eastward. Our people abandon the old for the new, influenced by what they see and hear, developing a Westernized style. They only know how to enjoy, not how to produce; they value pleasure, not accumulation, leading to years of trade deficits and the decline of national power. If this situation continues, even without natural disasters, man-made calamities, internal worries, and external threats, the nation's vitality will be exhausted, reaching a point where it cannot be sustained. Moreover, after ten years of military campaigns and rampant inflation, the general population, in addition to saving the dying and helping the wounded, knows that saving for future use is not as good as enjoying the moment. Therefore, they spend freely, caring only for the present, unaware of the concept of savings. The decline of rural areas and the sharp decrease in bank deposits have long caused us to worry about the future of the national economy!

Now, the central authorities, to coordinate economic reform measures, are reportedly considering a movement for national construction through thrift and diligence, the guidelines of which were published in yesterday's newspaper. Superficially, this may seem like an old chestnut, lacking novel significance. However, to become wealthy and strong, and cultivate the foundation of the nation, we must start with this fundamental work. Everyone knows that increasing production should be the basis of all economic reforms, but without the entire nation working hard and intensifying efforts, the goal of increased production cannot be achieved. As for simultaneously advancing Chinese-style production and Western-style enjoyment, production and sales will inevitably become disconnected, and income and expenditure will become increasingly imbalanced. Everyone knows that this is the fatal wound of our country's socio-economy today! Mr. Jiang Baili once said, "A country whose living conditions are separated from combat conditions will surely perish." We can adapt his saying and say that a country whose spending habits are separated from production methods will surely be poor. Therefore, the two words "thrift and diligence" cannot be ignored at any time, but they are especially urgent at this moment.

Take Britain as an example. After the Second European War, although its national strength was far less than before due to excessive consumption, its industry was developed, exports were booming, and its national income and expenditure had a huge surplus last year. In terms of consumption, it still maintains very strict rationing. In terms of work, even women are still subject to national control. It can truly be said that no land is left uncultivated, and no person is left idle. In our country, where both the public and private sectors are struggling and universally poor, shouldn't we be even more vigilant?

As mentioned above, inflation and the loss of the currency's ability to store value is undoubtedly a factor promoting waste. Therefore, when the currency value is depreciating step by step and prices are rising day by day, it is indeed not easy to require savings and interest accrual to preserve the general surplus purchasing power. However, after the currency reform, the situation is clearly different. Because the restriction of similar practices is strictly enforced everywhere, and hoarding is strictly prohibited at the same time, prices are expected to stabilize in the future, and the currency value is no longer in danger of falling. Moreover, the gold yuan is publicly issued and has a fixed maximum issuance amount to restrict it, so there is no need to worry about it being too inflated. Therefore, in our recent article on increasing the capital of banks and savings, we mentioned encouraging savings. This is because the possibility of implementing savings in the future environment is indeed much higher than before. Now, the central government is strengthening thrift and simultaneously promoting the national construction movement through thrift and diligence, presumably also to use this favorable environment to re-cultivate national strength.

The atmosphere in China has always been top-down. As the saying goes, the virtue of a gentleman is like the wind, and the virtue of a small man is like grass; the wind on the grass will surely bend it. Therefore, after this movement unfolds, in addition to hoping that all sectors of society respond in unison, we also hope that the general adults and gentlemen will lead by example, setting an example for the people. In the past, the national goods movement was repeatedly promulgated in official documents, and the authorities may have had the sincerity to promote it, but in the end, the speakers were earnest, and the listeners were dismissive. The lesson of this failure seems worthy of deep thought!

### Torrential Rain Ceases for Three Days and Nights, Most of Chengdu City is Flooded; The Disaster in Western Sichuan is Particularly Severe, All Transportation is Suspended

[Our Chengdu Dispatch on the 14th] The torrential rain in Chengdu ceased for three days and nights, causing another flood, the first since July 4th of last year. Most of the city was flooded, and the suburbs were a vast expanse of water. Rivers overflowed, houses collapsed, and material losses were heavy. Fortunately, there were few casualties, but all residents are without food and awaiting relief, a very miserable situation. The disaster in western Sichuan is particularly severe. Over half of the highways and embankments were destroyed, and all transportation was suspended. The Dujiangyan irrigation system also collapsed, and all losses are yet to be calculated.

### Xu Baiqi and Two Others; Have Not Yet Been Brought to Trial for Interrogation

Legal Procedure Issues Unresolved

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 14th] Xu Baiqi, Tao Qiming, and Yuan Yang'an were arrested by the Capital Police Department and sent to the Prosecutor's Office of the Special Criminal Tribunal in Nanjing for interrogation due to leaking the confidential information of the currency reform. However, due to legal procedure issues, the Prosecutor's Office of the Special Criminal Tribunal has not yet opened a trial. The focus of the dispute is that the Presidential Office wants to hand over the Xu case to the Special Criminal Tribunal for trial, while the Executive Yuan believes that the case is a breach of official duty by public officials who leaked confidential information and should be investigated by the Capital District Prosecutor's Office. As a result, the interrogation work of the Special Prosecutor's Office has been difficult to begin before the legal procedures are resolved. On the 14th, Chen Guangyu, the chief prosecutor of the District Prosecutor's Office, and Wang Wenjun, the chief prosecutor of the Special Prosecutor's Office, consulted on the investigation work of the Xu case. It has not yet been specifically decided whether the case will be investigated by the District Prosecutor's Office or the Special Prosecutor's Office.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The investigation report and related proposals drafted by Supervising Committee members Tang Honglie and Sun Yulin on the investigation of the leaking confidential information and stock dumping case were submitted to the Supervising Committee on the morning of the 14th. Once the impeachment and other cases submitted are reviewed and established, they can be announced.

### US Aid for Four Railways; Does Not Match the Ministry of Communications' Plan

Will Be Redrafted or Revised

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 14th] Most of the funds for the ten new economic recovery plans announced by Mr. Stuart, the head of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration investigation team, are designated for improving China's four major railways. The reporter recently visited the spokesperson of the Ministry of Communications regarding the opinions on the allocation of the amount of this aid and the plan for its use. According to the discussion, after the principle of American aid to improve the railway was determined, we drafted a detailed plan for the needs and uses. The need was to stipulate in principle the goals to be improved and the construction standards for each railway, and the use was to allocate the aid funds within the scope of the maximum possible improvement. These two plans have been drafted several times by the Ministry of Communications in conjunction with the various railway bureaus. However, the amount of funds in the original plan does not match what Mr. Stuart announced, so the Ministry of Communications will draft a new plan or revise and reduce the previously drafted plan.

### Regulations on Punishing Crimes Related to Prohibition of Opium and Drugs; Extension of Implementation Period for Two Years

It is reported that the Executive Yuan has approved this request and sent it to the Legislative Yuan for review.

### Where is Shanghai Going?

— Chiang Ching-kuo

Speech to the Shanghai Youth Army Alumni Association Conference, September 12

(I)

Today, our nation has a major flaw, which is that many people clearly know we are a poor country, yet insist on putting on a pretentious display. If we only view China from Rue Pétain in Shanghai, then China's cultural level seems very high. And if we only look at the so-called Shanghai people's luxurious clothing and fashionable cars, then the enjoyment of the Chinese people seems to exceed that of any other country. But how many Rue Pétains are there after all? And how many people are wearing luxurious clothes and riding in fashionable cars? I can say that it is a very small number. The vast majority of people still live in thatched huts and attics. There are even tens of millions of people wandering the streets and alleys, groaning in the fields and gullies. They are simply a group of beggars, even considering a pair of straw sandals a rare luxury.

We should frankly admit that our country is a poor country, and our compatriots are suffering compatriots. We must know that foreign cars, refrigerators, perfume, and nylon stockings are all white blood cells parasitic in a poor country. They are opium that destroys the national economy. Using foreign exchange to exchange for high-end luxury goods is a national suicide policy. We are not opposed to the development of foreign trade, but we should know that what we need are machines and the machines that make machines. Because only the industrialization and electrification of the country can turn a poor country into a rich and strong country. The problem in the past was that everyone refused to admit that China was a poor country and did not know that a poor country should have the plans of a poor country. Today, we are indeed a poor country, but should we continue to let it be poor? No, continuing to be poor is the road to destruction.

Why are we so poor? From the Xinhai Revolution to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, in these thirty years, our country has encountered constant foreign aggression. Even today, we have not been able to let our people breathe a sigh of relief. The external enemy should be imperialism, but what about the internal situation? Our internal enemies include local tyrants and evil gentry in the countryside and speculative merchants in the cities. These two forces collude with each other and take advantage of each other, resulting in the current instability of the country. At the same time, the development of the Communist Party has also taken advantage of this weakness. Therefore, it has further increased the difficulties of the country today. If we want to not be poor, we must eliminate these factors that lead to poverty. This is a great thing and also the most serious and difficult thing in the final stage of the National Revolution.

(II)

Since we admit that our country is a poor country, can we ignore it because it is poor? Only unfilial children look down on their poor parents; only unfilial descendants of the Yellow Emperor look down on their poor motherland. Precisely because the country is poor and the compatriots are poor, we should love, protect, and rescue it even more. The reason why heroes and heroines in history are admired by people for generations lies in the fact that their blood flowed for the country and their lives were sacrificed for the country. Loving the country, protecting the country, and saving the country are the great spirit of Chinese tradition. Serving the country with loyalty is the most glorious cause that the Chinese people believe in. However, today, some people are anesthetized by US dollars, gold, pearls, and treasures, and have forgotten the country. Still others are anesthetized by foreign, incorrect, so-called fashionable ideas and have forgotten the nation. They are all anesthetized and can no longer think of the pain of a person without a country, nor can they think of how painful it is to be abandoned by the country. They never dream that if there is no country, their future lives will probably be worse than those of White Russians and Jews.

The Soviet Union has always advocated "workers of all countries, unite!", but when the German army approached Moscow, it had to put away the slogan "workers of all countries, unite!" and replace it with the slogan "protect the motherland." The reason why the Soviet Union defeated the enemy and achieved victory was not by calling on "workers of all countries, unite!", but by calling on "protect the motherland." Tito of Yugoslavia was a disciple of Stalin and a loyal member of the Communist Party, but when he thought of the vital interests of his own country, he bravely broke away from the Communist International. From this, we can see that in today's era, world revolution and international lines are dead ends. If we want to survive, we must have a country. That is to say, we Chinese people can only have life under the banner of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth. (Continued on Page 3)

### Three Envoys Revisit the Kremlin Yesterday for Talks with Molotov, Requesting a Guarantee to Lift the Berlin Blockade

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 14th – A Moscow broadcast reported that the special envoys of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France went to the Kremlin at 6:00 PM Moscow time (3:00 PM Greenwich Mean Time) to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Previously, British envoy Roberts and French Ambassador Chataigneau had visited US Ambassador Smith to review the final minute of advice from their respective governments, before proceeding to the Kremlin by car.

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 14th – It is understood that Stalin will not participate in the four-power conference at the Kremlin on the 14th. Furthermore, unless the Soviet Union can change its attitude to make progress in the conference, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have agreed to prepare for a break. Unless the Berlin blockade is lifted immediately, the Western powers will submit the Berlin issue to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion.

[United Press London, 13th] Reliable sources say: the Western three envoys will try to hold a decisive meeting in Moscow with the Soviet authorities on the Berlin situation. Only the Kremlin can decide whether Stalin will attend the meeting. If Stalin does not intend to participate, the three envoys will likely meet with Molotov. It is believed here that the three envoys will directly ask Stalin to clearly order the Soviet commander in Berlin to guarantee that the blockade will be lifted and that negotiations on details there can continue unimpeded. After the Soviet meeting on the Berlin crisis moved from Moscow to Berlin, the Soviet side suddenly raised various technical issues, shattering all hope of reaching an agreement to lift the Berlin blockade and issue a unified currency for Berlin. British sources here believe that unrest that intensifies the Berlin situation is unlikely to be prevented from recurring unless the Soviet military commander issues a direct order to the German Communist Party to stop it.

[United Press Washington, 13th] Secretary of State Marshall met alone with President Truman at the White House today, presumably discussing the explosive situation after the Soviet Union refused to lift the Berlin blockade, but Marshall and other State Department officials declined to comment on the meeting or the stage to which the Berlin situation had reached.

### Discussion of the Disposal of Italian Colonies, Four Powers Have No Hope of Compromise, Likely to be Submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for Handling

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 14th – A Paris broadcast reported that the four-power representatives held a second meeting at 11:00 AM this morning. The French representative suggested returning Somaliland to Italy under United Nations trusteeship, to be ruled by Italy. The United Kingdom and the United States have accepted this, but the Soviet Union expressed opposition. Another French suggestion was that issues arising in the four-power meeting be referred to a committee of experts for study. The opinions of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have also aligned on this. Based on the current situation, there is very little hope of reaching an agreement on the Italian colonial issue. Even on the question of whether the four-power representatives have the authority to decide on the future disposal of Libya, Eritrea, and Somaliland, opinions cannot converge. If an agreement cannot be reached by the 15th, then in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Peace with Italy, this issue must be submitted to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion.

[Washington News Agency Paris, 14th] The report of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference on Italian colonies is now on the agenda and will be studied by the four-power representatives present.

[United Press Paris, 14th] It is understood that the United Kingdom and the United States will seek to have the United Nations pass a resolution maintaining the status quo of Italian-held Libya, because the United States has an air base in western Libya. On the morning of the 14th, the Western countries hoped to maintain the current military administration, but the Soviet Union suggested that all colonies be returned to Italy. This point is undoubtedly opposed by the Western countries. The strategic value of this issue far outweighs its economic and political value. The Soviet Union will make every effort to seize the opportunity to enable the Italian Communist Party to obtain material for anti-British and anti-American propaganda.

### The French Queuille Cabinet Wins the Confidence of Parliament

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 14th – A Paris broadcast reported that the French National Assembly passed a vote of confidence in Queuille's new cabinet on the 14th by a vote of 335 to 225.

### US Representatives to the United Nations General Assembly Depart for Paris by Ship, Secretary Marshall to Fly to Europe on the 19th

[United States Information Service New York, 13th] Most of the 71 members of the US delegation to the United Nations General Assembly departed for Paris today aboard the "America" mail ship. The delegation is led by Austin and Mrs. Roosevelt. Dewey's foreign policy advisor Dulles is currently in Europe. Marshall is scheduled to fly to Paris on the 19th.

### The US Attitude Towards the Japanese Peace Conference is Cold

[United Press Washington, 13th] Diplomatic circles say that if rumors are true that China will raise its desire to conclude a peace treaty with Japan at this session of the United Nations General Assembly, this is only China's attempt to gauge the views of the four powers on the possibility of concluding a peace treaty with Japan, not to put the matter on the agenda.

[Central News Agency Washington, 13th] According to reliable sources, senior US officials remain cool to the issue of a Japanese peace treaty. They believe that as long as East-West tensions remain unresolved this year, even convening a preliminary five-power meeting on this issue is unlikely. Although they have gradually realized the importance of the strategic situation in the Far East for Soviet expansion in Europe, senior US officials believe that raising the issue of a Japanese peace conference at this time is still inappropriate. Diplomatic sources say that it is doubtful whether this issue can be discussed at the United Nations General Assembly, as it is not on the agenda.

### US to Resume Acceptance of Air Parcels to China from Saturday

[Central News Agency Washington, 13th, United Press] The Post Office Department announced that it will begin handling air mail to Belgium, Luxembourg, and seven locations across the Pacific from the 18th. The aforementioned locations across the Pacific include Australia, China, Fiji, Hong Kong, Macau, the Philippines, and Siam.

### Indian Army Marches Directly on Hyderabad City, Fierce Resistance from Hyderabad on All Lines in the Southwest and Northwest, Muslim Public Demands Declaration of War on India

[United Press New Delhi, 14th] According to news from Karachi on the 14th: Muslim public have held marches demanding that Pakistan declare war on India, because the Indian army has invaded Hyderabad. According to the latest news from Pune, near the front lines, journalists have been permitted to enter the war zone. It is said that the Indian army is attacking Hyderabad city from all sides. General speculation is that the Indian government's declaration of a state of emergency may be a prelude to war with Pakistan. The declaration of a state of emergency is clearly intended to prevent religious riots by the minority Muslim population in India, or to prepare to repel Pakistani attacks on the border.

According to news from Bombay, where a concentrated minority of Muslims live: police and troops have stepped up patrols to prevent any possible disturbances. An army spokesman said that the Indian army is constantly advancing, but he acknowledged that it has encountered strong resistance from the Hyderabad army on the western, northwestern, and southwestern fronts.

[United Press Bombay, 14th] According to news from Pune city: Indian aircraft bombed Bidar city, fifteen miles northwest of Hyderabad city, on the 14th to assist the advance of army troops. According to the Pune dispatch of the "Free Press Journal" of Pune: the Muslim stronghold of Usberda city has been captured by the Indian army.

[United Press New Delhi, 13th] Indian troops attacked Hyderabad on the 13th under the cover of aircraft and artillery, and captured Nalgonda, a city at the intersection of railways and highways, located 200 miles northwest of Hyderabad city. Indian officials said that the Indian Air Force had been dropping leaflets over Hyderabad all day, stating: once normal living conditions in the state are effectively restored, the Indian army will no longer be stationed in Hyderabad. Thereafter, the people of Hyderabad will have the opportunity to decide their future.

### Security Council to Convene Special Meeting Tomorrow to Discuss Indian Crisis

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 14th – A Paris broadcast reported that Jebb, the President of the United Nations Security Council, is scheduled to convene a special meeting on the 16th to discuss the Hyderabad crisis in India.

### New Burmese Cabinet Formed

Government Troops Abandon Yangdong West of Rangoon

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 14th – A Rangoon broadcast reported that Prime Minister Thakin Nu announced on the 14th that the new Burmese cabinet will be organized by five members of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, five members of the Socialist Party, three members of the Yellow Band Party, and four members of the Independent Party. Political figures believe that the Minister of Interior and the Minister of Defense will both remain in their posts, and Ko Ko Gyi will serve as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. The Parliament has already accepted this new cabinet lineup.

[Central News Agency Rangoon, 13th] According to a government gazette, government troops have now abandoned Yangdong, west of Rangoon. The fall of Yangdong has temporarily halted military shipping between Rangoon and Bassein.

### British Conscription Extended by Three Months

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 14th – The British government announced on the 14th that the military service of all conscripts in the British army will be extended by three months.

### US Announces Results of Investigation into Soviet Teachers Case

### British Parliament Special Session Opens, King George Attends and Delivers Brief Speech, Bill to Reduce Powers of the House of Lords to be Reconsidered

[United Press London, 14th] The King attended the special session of Parliament today and delivered a brief speech, which read in full: "Lords and Members of the House of Commons: I have summoned you to meet at this time so that you may give further consideration to the bill to amend the Parliament Act of 1911, because disagreements arose between the two Houses in the previous session. No other business is scheduled for this session." Forty-one gun salutes were fired in respect when the King and Queen arrived at the entrance to the House of Lords.

[United Press London, 13th] The Labour government launched a campaign to weaken some of the powers of the House of Lords. The dispute between the Houses of Parliament arose from this bill. The House of Lords has already rejected the bill, and Labour now hopes to win its fight with the Lords through clever parliamentary tactics. These tactics will allow the steel nationalization bill to become law before the 1950 general election. The Conservative Party's minority of seats in the House of Commons makes it unable to oppose Labour's bill, so it can only fight in the House of Lords.

[Agence France-Presse London, 13th] The Cabinet decided that due to Prime Minister Attlee's incomplete recovery, Deputy Prime Minister Morrison will speak on behalf of the government in the parliamentary debate. The Cabinet also decided that Foreign Secretary Bevin's report on the Berlin situation and the Moscow talks should be postponed for several days.

### Korea to Request United Nations General Assembly Member States to Recognize the South Korean Government De Jure, Head of South Korean Delegation to the United Nations General Assembly Speaks in the US

[Central News Agency New York, 14th] Chang Myon, head of the South Korean delegation attending the United Nations General Assembly, said here today that Korea will ask the United Nations General Assembly to recognize the South Korean government led by Syngman Rhee and introduce all member states, requesting them to grant it de jure recognition. The South Korean delegation also includes Chang Ki-yong, Kim Hwal-ran, and Chun Kyu-hong. The delegation arrived here on the 11th and will depart for Paris aboard the Queen Mary tomorrow morning. In a one-hour press conference, in addition to expressing the above two goals, Chang also said: (1) Communist-controlled North Korea may also send representatives to attend, but because the Soviet Union has refused to allow the United Nations delegation to visit North Korea, the elections in North Korea have not been monitored by the delegation, so even if North Korea sends a delegation to Paris, it will not be able to attend the United Nations General Assembly; (2) At the request of Korea, the United States is currently training the Korean army. South Korea will soon have well-equipped troops for self-defense; (3) Korea is also requesting economic assistance from the United States.

### Where is Shanghai Going?

— Chiang Ching-kuo

(III)

(Continued from Page 2) While we acknowledge that China is poor and that China must survive independently, we should also acknowledge that China is a powerful country. China has such vast land, rich surface and underground resources, and 450 million hardworking and simple compatriots. This is truly an inexhaustible, inexhaustible natural great force. However, what we regret is that we do not have the opportunity to develop it, to mobilize it, and to make it play its role. If we want to turn our country from poor to rich and strong, we must use this force. We can say that when this force is brought into play, it will surely be the greatest force in the world. Not only that, but China also has a kind of hidden, latent spiritual force, which is the righteousness of our Chinese nation and the noble morality of the people. The Chinese nation has never yielded at every important juncture. In fact, this is the source of all strength. When Japanese imperialism attacked us, we knew that we did not have enough strength to resist the powerful warlords, but when sacrifice reached the final moment, we resolutely rose up to fight against Japan regardless of everything. Finally, we finally won the victory.

After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist Party used pressure and inducement to the government, attempting to organize a coalition government. At that time, there were even many people in the country who came out to criticize the government's decision to suppress the rebellion, but at the critical moment of life and death, the government never yielded to it. Many people thought that organizing a coalition government would stop the war, but everyone must understand that if a coalition government were established, our country would probably have become Czechoslovakia, Poland, or Romania long ago. Fortunately, we still have the traditional spirit of not surrendering and not yielding, so although we are poor and suffer today, we still maintain an independent personality. President Chiang, who leads our revolution, is the representative of this Chinese national righteousness. His greatness lies in the fact that he is in the most difficult, most distressed, most dangerous, and most complex environment, but he must be able to save the country and the people from the storm and rain without fear of hardship and difficulty. We believe that under the leadership of the leader, our country will be able to maintain an independent and autonomous position. If we take this opportunity, all our people will be of one heart and mind, work together, and continue to struggle, then our country will surely be transformed from poor to rich and strong. There is no doubt about this.

(IV)

Today, the country's environment is quite difficult. This difficult environment is indeed a crisis for the country. But we can say that this crisis can also be turned into an opportunity. Now we have reached the point where we must make a firm decision to thoroughly reform the country's politics and economy. The country needs to exist, and the people need to live. After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and three years of suppressing the rebellion, the people's lives are already unbearable. But to improve the people's lives, we must stabilize society, we must stabilize the economy, and to stabilize the economy, we must reform the currency system. This reason is very obvious. So I can say here that the new economic policy promulgated by the government now is not just a simple decree, but should be regarded as a social revolution and the beginning of the implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood. Today's suppression of commodity prices is only a technical task, and the real purpose is to eliminate the phenomenon of economic inequality in society, or more precisely, to not allow the phenomenon of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer to grow in society.

Many people doubt whether this new economic policy will be successful. This is not surprising, because many policies in the past have failed. But if this policy is regarded as a social revolutionary movement and this policy is implemented with revolutionary means, then I believe this policy will definitely be successful. Otherwise, if this matter is regarded as an ordinary government order, dealt with temporarily, and perfunctorily, then we might as well not do it. Even if we do it, it will fail. Therefore, we recognize that the nature of this new economic policy is a revolutionary movement. Therefore, from the beginning, we have advocated mobilizing the broad masses of people to participate in this great work and should tell the people that this is our own business and we should rise up to complete it ourselves. The people's affairs can only be solved by the people's own hands. Relying on others is unreliable. To turn the old society over, we must use the greatest strength and the greatest price to succeed. Today has come the time for thorough reform. As far as Shanghai is concerned, the society here is indeed corrupt. However, we should not ignore that although Shanghai is corrupt, the power of resistance still exists. Therefore, all our people must carry out this arduous work in a planned, organized, and step-by-step manner. Many people think that today's situation must change. Yes, it should change, and it is already changing. But the strangest thing is that those who used to advocate change suddenly no longer advocate change, or they say that it should change gradually. These people do not understand that social changes will inevitably encounter unexpected storms and difficulties. They are afraid when they see danger and obstacles. That will not succeed. Now that it has begun to change, it must change to the end and it must change to a reason. (Continued on Page 4)

### Special Tribunal Holds Hearing for Four Defendants in Black Market Gold and Foreign Currency Case; China Cement Company Manager and Assistant Manager Called to Testify; Discrepancies in the Testimony of Wei Boxiang and Meiji; Aiqier Admits to Selling US Dollars

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wei Boxiang, a legal foreign exchange broker of the Central Bank, his wife Yao Zaiying, Meiji, a Russian of Jewish nationality, and Xi Ren Aiqier, the general manager of Annan Bank, were previously investigated and prosecuted by the Special Criminal Tribunal on suspicion of engaging in black market gold and foreign currency transactions. Yesterday, the tribunal brought forth the four defendants, including Wei Boxiang, who were in custody, and summoned Shi Naixiu, the manager of China Cement Company, and Yao Qingde, the assistant manager, to testify. Judge Jiang Shanchu conducted a public trial.

At around 3 p.m., after the judge took the bench, he immediately ordered the four defendants in custody to stand to one side. Wei's face was fair and pale. He was wearing a checkered, light flannel suit jacket, gray gabardine trousers, and yellow leather shoes. Wei's wife looked thin and pale, her hair tied with pink silk. She wore a blue cheongsam, a light gray woolen coat, and was barefoot, wearing black satin embroidered shoes. Aiqier was tall and robust, with graying hair, a ruddy complexion, and wore glasses. He was wearing a blue suit jacket and gray trousers. Meiji was relatively thin and small, and wore glasses and a flannel suit. Wei's wife whispered to Wei, and she dabbed at her tears with a white handkerchief from time to time.

First, Yao Qingde was called to testify. The focus of the questioning was to investigate where the 30,000 US dollars used by Wei Boxiang for the transaction came from. According to Yao, he is a Shanghai native, residing at 121 Yanging Road, and is a businessman. Wei's ex-wife is his elder sister; he serves as the assistant manager of China Cement Company; because China Cement Company applied to the Import and Export Control Committee for the import of raw materials, the committee approved 40,000 US dollars per month, totaling 200,000 US dollars, which were settled in foreign exchange over the four months of April, May, June, and July. In early August, 6,000 US dollars were handed over to the Bank of China. The remaining 34,000 US dollars were handed over to Wei Boxiang on August 26 to be passed on to the Central Bank to purchase foreign exchange certificates, with a handling fee of 574,000 legal tender. He does not know what happened after the money was handed over to Wei Boxiang.

Witness Shi Naixiu stated: 52 years old, from Jiashan, Zhejiang, residing at Lane 6, No. 877 Zhongzheng Middle Road, serving as the manager of China Cement Company. His responsibilities within the company are to promote business. Economic deployment is the responsibility of Yao. He only knows that the 34,000 US dollars were borrowed from the company's general manager and handed over by Yao to Wei Boxiang to purchase foreign exchange certificates. Because this matter was handled by Yao, the details are not clear.

### Testimony of the Four Defendants

Wei Boxiang testified: After Yao handed me the 34,000 US dollars on August 26, the banks were closed on the 27th for Confucius' birthday, and the money could not be sent in time. It happened that Meiji borrowed money from me, so I temporarily lent it to him. As a designated foreign exchange broker of the Central Bank, the daily inflow and outflow of US dollars is around 100,000 yuan, so I did not initially take this temporary loan of over 30,000 US dollars seriously. I did not expect the situation to become so serious.

Yao Zaiying testified: She went to Meiji's house with Wei, but did not carry or transport US dollars.

Meiji denied borrowing 30,000 US dollars from Wei, but stated that because Wei needed money, he lent Wei a check for 120,999 gold yuan from Datong Bank, which was equivalent to about 30,000 US dollars. Wei mortgaged 30,000 US dollars. It was not a buying or selling transaction. Meiji admitted to purchasing 3,000 US dollars from Aiqier on August 18, with each dollar priced at 10.7 million legal tender (i.e., the black market price at the time).

Aiqier also admitted to selling 3,000 US dollars to Meiji, but the US dollars were not his own property. They were deposited there by a friend from Xiguo, who has already returned to France.

The hearing concluded at around 5 p.m. Yao Zaiying requested bail in court, but it was not allowed. She was instructed to submit a written application for consideration. The four defendants were all returned to custody.

When they stepped out of the trial room, photographers rushed to capture the scene. Zhang Boxiang put on sunglasses, Meiji lowered his head and walked quickly, and Aiqier covered his face with a white silk scarf. All three had their hands handcuffed and were escorted by bailiffs to the detention center of the Special Tribunal.

During the discussion of this proposal, Speaker Pan first explained that since the proposal in the Public Utilities Section "to allow the transfer of automobile ownership by the Municipal Government" has been passed, it seems to contradict the point of reducing automobiles in this proposal and should be noted. Regarding the point of stopping gasoline price hikes, the opposing and supporting parties had conflicting opinions. Later, because the number of councilors did not reach the legal quorum, it was not put to a vote. The Speaker announced that it would be changed to be discussed and decided today.

### Clerk of the Cashier Department of China Textile Company Sentenced for Misappropriating Public Funds

[Our Newspaper's Report] Huang Zheng, a clerk in the Cashier Department of China Textile Company, failed in his private business in March of this year. Colluding with Fei Yuwen, a clerk in the same department, he set up a Hu Qifan account in the Bank of Communications. Because Fei Yuwen was in charge of the company's cash, the two secretly deposited public funds into the Hu Qifan account and used bleach to remove the words "Hu Qifan" from the deposit slip and changed it to the China Textile account name to cover it up. Huang then used the money to buy and sell government bonds, once for more than 4 billion yuan and once for 3 billion yuan. After China Textile Company discovered this, the money was returned, and Fei Yuwen took the opportunity to flee. Huang Zheng was detained by the company and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. The case was heard in the District Court a few days ago. Chen Shouchi, the head of the Cashier Department of China Textile Company, testified that Fei Yuwen, who is on the run, deliberately misappropriated public funds and altered the date and amount of the deposit slip, with as many as 14 discrepancies, totaling more than 45 billion yuan. The defendant Huang Zheng admitted to embezzling more than 7 billion yuan from Fei twice. The case was recently sentenced by the District Court: Huang Zheng was sentenced to three years and six months in prison for helping others and indirectly profiting from his management affairs, and was deprived of civil rights for five years. Fei Yuwen, who is on the run, will be prosecuted separately after he is caught.

### Tongji Hospital Violates the Law; Raising Prices is Reported Secretly; Director Jiang Summoned for Questioning

### The Real Estate Industry is Gradually Becoming Active; Speculators are Stirring Up Trouble, and Prices Have Risen by an Average of 20%

[Our Newspaper's Report] After the currency reform of August 19, the fluctuation range of prices has narrowed, and the markets of various industries have tended to be calm. The real estate industry, which has been dormant for a long time, has a good chance of recovering. According to real estate insiders yesterday: After the currency reform of August 19, many of the surplus funds from the National Bank's exchange of gold and foreign currency are concentrated in real estate. Although transactions are active, the actual number of transactions is not large. This can be checked in the handling of real estate transfer cases by the Land Administration Bureau. The number of transfer cases after August 19 has not increased compared to before. He said: After August 19, real estate asking prices in the city have increased by about 50% compared to before. Most of these asking prices are stirred up by brokers, and few transactions are made. The actual transaction price is about 20% higher than before August 19. It is explained that although real estate prices cannot be artificially limited, natural price limits still exist. Those who truly want to purchase real estate can solve the problems of investment and housing shortages and win the good name of supporting the authorities' housing construction policy, so why not do it? However, if the land price is too high, the society cannot consume it after the houses are built, which is in vain. It is estimated that about 10,000 buildings have been completed in the city in the past year, but the depreciation rate of houses is also quite serious, estimated to be 5,000 buildings per year. He hopes that after everything is stable in the future, there should be a reasonable measure for real estate, and the once-popular problem of premium fees can be eliminated. Currently, because (1) the government intends to encourage funds to flow to the real estate industry, (2) land prices are not related to people's livelihood, and the government only needs to control rents, the future of the real estate industry in the city is trending towards becoming more active.

### Appropriation of Donated Land in Ai Li Garden for Construction of a News Museum Unanimously Approved: Temporary Motions by Feng Youzhen, Yue Junyi, etc.

[Special Dispatch] Senators Feng Youzhen, Zhao Junhao, Zhan Wenhu, Tang Shichang, Zhang Zhihan, and over eighty others, yesterday proposed a temporary motion: requesting the allocation of five mu of land from the Hardoon George donation for the construction of a news museum. The reasoning stated: Shanghai is the national center for the news industry, holding a leading position. The number of practitioners is in the thousands. Before the war, there was a guild hall, though rudimentary in scale. During the eight years of resistance against Japan, there was relocation and movement, and the hall was destroyed. Since the post-war restoration, the guild has been re-established for three years, but due to various difficulties, it still lacks a permanent meeting place. Recently, Hardoon George donated land in Ai Li Garden, which this council has resolved to accept, with plans to construct libraries, art museums, and other facilities on the land. The news industry is highly valued by the world, and Shanghai is particularly tied to international perception. So many journalists are employed here, but there is no place for further study or research. Domestic and foreign journalists, whether passing through Shanghai or visiting, lack a place to stay. Furthermore, people from all walks of life lack a suitable venue to interact with the press, make announcements, seek explanations, or inquire about certain issues. This is a source of suffering for journalists themselves and a deficiency for the entire city of Shanghai. We hereby suggest to the general assembly that five mu of land be allocated from the Hardoon George donation to construct a news museum, incorporating the Journalists' Association and the Newspaper Publishers' Association. In addition, a reporters' guest house and an auditorium should be built to meet the needs of national press conferences. In the future, international news conferences may be convened in Shanghai, which is not impossible. All construction costs will be jointly raised by the Newspaper Publishers' Association and the Journalists' Association, without the need to spend public funds or increase the burden on citizens. Two points are suggested for handling: (1) Allocate five mu of public land from the Hardoon George donation of Ai Li Garden for the construction of a news museum. The city government should plan this concurrently with the library, museum, and art museum. (2) The construction costs will be raised independently by the Journalists' Association and the Newspaper Publishers' Association. Result of the discussion: All senators unanimously approved. This motion was successfully passed. However, the area of land allocated will be determined by the city government in a comprehensive manner, and the exact number of mu is not yet specified.

### Post Office Employees Petition Over Salary Issues

It is reported that Director Wu expressed great sympathy for the employees' demands and will discuss the matter with union leaders again today.

### Two Pawnshop Owners Arrested for Trafficking Opium Powder

Furthermore, the Xinjing Police Precinct recently uncovered a drug trafficking case at Huachang Mat Shop at 556 Zhoujiazui Road, seizing opium powder and apprehending a man named Tong Wenyuan. Subsequently, Liang Fulin was arrested at 4 Kangding Road, Shengsheng Lane, and opium powder and raw opium were found during a search. Finally, drug dealers Liu Guangyuan and his wife were arrested at 45 Caojia Street, Old West Gate. The entire case was transferred to the District Court yesterday.

### Where is Shanghai Going?

— Chiang Ching-kuo

(Continued from Page 3) In the process of advancing our work, there are many enemies there threatening us, saying that continuing to inspect warehouses and punish unscrupulous merchants will lead to shortages and factory shutdowns. Indeed, if we stand on the position of maintaining superficial prosperity, it will disappoint the people; however, if we stand on the position of revolution, this is nothing to fear. The lack of cigarettes, wool yarn, sweaters, silk, wool fabric, or even pork, is not something to be afraid of. Because among the more than five million people in Shanghai, those who can afford to wear noble fabrics are not many. As long as we hold the daily necessities for the masses—rice, salt, oil, coal, and cloth—that is enough for life. We believe that, in order to overwhelm the power of unscrupulous merchants and stabilize the lives of the people of the city, the citizens of Shanghai will never fear the lack of luxurious clothing and abandon the courage to fight unscrupulous merchants. If speculators are not overthrown, adventurers are not driven away, and the nouveau riche are not eliminated, the people of Shanghai will never have a day of peace. As for the issue of factory shutdowns, the government's policy is guided by the Three Principles of the People, protecting private property and encouraging private enterprise. This was the case in the past, it is the case now, and it will be the case in the future. However, if factory owners use shutdowns as a means of coercion, that is nothing to fear. If you don't run the factory, someone else will. With such determination and courage, the new economic policy will never fail. From now on, as long as we continue production, the people have food to eat, and those who have money do not speculate but engage in productive enterprises, we can put Shanghai's economy on the right track and the people's lives on a regular path. Only in this way can the new economic policy be considered successful. We are not afraid of the threats of saboteurs or the intimidation of speculators. We only have the spirit of sacrifice to carry out the implementation of the new economic policy.

Furthermore, there are many so-called economic theorists who seem right but are not. They believe that solving economic problems should start from a purely economic perspective, otherwise things will become increasingly chaotic. This point of view does not understand the relationship between economics and politics, does not understand the many social and political factors hidden in economic issues, does not understand the role of social politics in influencing economics, and does not understand that the establishment of an economic structure relies on the power of social politics. Economics and social politics are difficult to separate in many complex problems. We should clearly tell everyone that the solution to economic problems should indeed be considered from an economic perspective, but if this leads to doubts about the new economic policies implemented by the government, or doubts about the severe punishment of unscrupulous merchants, this is tantamount to defending unscrupulous merchants. The result is that unscrupulous merchants can act without restraint, making it impossible for the government to implement its policies.

(V)

The economic control work in Shanghai has been going on for three weeks. During these three weeks, because the government's policies have been supported by the people, prices have been stabilized and the credit of the Gold Yuan Certificate has been established. This should be attributed to the majority of the people in Shanghai. On the second day of issuing the Gold Yuan Certificate, some unscrupulous merchants came out to attempt to destroy the price limits of August 19, in order to shake the government's credit. Everyone should remember that in those days, four or five thousand cotton yarn speculators crowded into the market, trying to use speculative capital to purchase cotton yarn and break through the set prices. We have used the power of the government to quell them. Later, although the formal exchange was closed, many people were still buying and selling outside the venue, trying to disrupt the market. We used strong force to close several large securities firms and arrested the most powerful brokers, and only then did we quell this storm. Since then, there have still been people doing a black market for gold notes, but we have finally extinguished these scum who destroy the credit of the government's Gold Yuan Certificate. The phenomena that are now gathering before us are that bank deposits have increased and interest rates have decreased, and real estate prices have also increased. This proves that Shanghai's economic life has begun to normalize. This phenomenon is beneficial to the people and legitimate merchants, which is also the goal we are pursuing. However, this is most unfavorable to unscrupulous merchants, who hope that the market will be more chaotic, because from the chaotic situation they can obtain large amounts of huge profits.

At present, Shanghai is still relatively stable, but does this mean that there will be no problems in the future? No. What we saw in front of us was not a beautiful scene of calm seas and clear skies, but a dangerous future hidden with violent storms and dark clouds, which we anticipated. We are not afraid. As long as we are resolute and brave, this storm will surely pass. We hope that the citizens of Shanghai will not waver and will be determined to eliminate all evil forces. What I want to point out in advance here is that although the big unscrupulous merchants have been closed up and those sentenced to death have been sentenced to death, their power has not been eliminated. Therefore, we must not be complacent about the work done in the short time in the past, and we must not be arrogant because we have received the praise of the people, so that we forget the more arduous struggles in the future. The work of the last three weeks is only the first step in a long-term struggle in the future. Young friends in Shanghai must not have a hedonistic attitude. Hedonism is only temporary and cannot last. What we need today is not temporary hedonism, but to see far, stand firm, and strike accurately. Only in this way can we have hope. We must work hard but not recklessly, quickly but not blindly, and practically but not chaotically. (Reckless work is irrational, blind work is unplanned, and chaotic work is without steps; on the contrary, we want to be rational, planned, and have steps.) (Continued on Page 5)

### Where is Shanghai Going?

— Chiang Ching-kuo

(Continued from Page 4) Since sending the big unscrupulous merchants to court and confiscating the hoarding of supplies, some people say that this is undemocratic and say that Chiang Ching-kuo is a robber. Many people think that I can scold you, but you cannot scold me; I can hit you, but you cannot hit me; I can do whatever I want is democracy. This is a big mistake. What is democracy? Democracy is standing on the interests of the majority of the people and using the power of the majority of the people to overwhelm the power of the minority. This is democracy. As for who is a robber, that is a question. For example, take Rong Hongyuan as an example: how much property he has, I am afraid it is difficult for him to calculate himself. I heard that he recently built a large garden and a large foreign house on Hongqiao Road, and some people say that half of Wuxi belongs to the Rong family. For example, take Wei Boxiang as an example: his property is several million US dollars. With them making any move they wish, the lives of thousands of people are threatened to starve to death, and their property foreign houses are built on the skulls of the people. Is this behavior any different from robbers? The government has now decided to confiscate the goods that are hoarded for speculation, because speculators use the goods as a tool to disrupt finance and manipulate the market, and not for the purpose of supplying the market. What we want to confiscate is not all the goods, but only the hoarded goods. The property of legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises should not only not be harmed in the slightest, but should be protected. The government has decided to sell all the confiscated goods and use the money to do relief work. Who is the robber? Everyone can tell at a glance. What is strange is that today there are people coming out to defend the robbers. Where has the conscience of this kind of people gone? Have they not seen the poor people suffering from hunger and cold, groaning and haggard? How painful a life are they living? Why do you want to defend the bloodsucking robbers instead of speaking for the poor people with no one to turn to?

The merchants in Shanghai have been influenced by the Shanghai style for more than a hundred years, and many people have long forgotten the morality of commerce. What they see is first money, second money, and third still money, but the current era is not the past era. The current era is the era of democracy, the era of the people. In this era, everyone should be equal before the national law, but in morality, we should sympathize with the majority of the poor people.

We cannot explain in detail our working style here, but there are a few things I must tell everyone: Recently, the phrase "beat the tigers" has become a popular term in Shanghai, but the so-called "beat the tigers" is individual heroism. What we need today is to mobilize the masses, organize the masses, and fight the evil forces to the end. In addition, recently someone has shouted the two words "Qingtian" (just and upright official), which is also the traditional wrong concept of our Chinese people, who do not regard themselves as the masters, and do not know that it is the duty of the state officials to relieve their pain. They themselves are the masters, and the officials are servants. I myself am young and have little knowledge, but I only have the spirit of serving the people and do what I should do. I am willing to be a servant of the people of Shanghai. If a person does nothing, then so be it; but if he does something, there must be mistakes. I hope that everyone will supervise me and correct me. Only in this way can we complete this arduous task.

The reason why many merchants in Shanghai can become rich is because they have two weapons made by their own shops: one is to fabricate rumors and deceive, and the other is to collude with corrupt officials. If officials collude with merchants, the government will punish them even more severely. Qi Zaiyu has already been shot, and I heard that in the near future, there will be similar people who will also get the same fate. This is a warning to those who are officials. As for fabricating rumors and deceiving, this is the talent of many merchants in Shanghai. They create something out of nothing, destroy the government, and shake the hearts of the people. I hope that you will not fall for their rumors and be deceived by them, and you should strike them mercilessly. Today in Shanghai, we cannot see the flames of war or hear the sound of gunfire, but we should not forget the soldiers in the front, who are fighting against the communists. What they are fighting for is to protect the unity and independence of the country and the lives and property of the people. The communists and the unscrupulous merchants are the two major enemies of the revolution. We must not let go of either of these two. We must beat them in the same way and together.

Finally, I want to say a few words to our Youth Army: Our Youth Army was organized under the leadership of our supreme leader, and it has had a glorious history in the past during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and it also has brilliant achievements now during the Suppression of Communist Rebellion. Some of us have already been demobilized, and some are still in the troops. Those who remain in the front-line troops must perform combat missions, but those who have been demobilized in the rear should also engage in economic suppression of communist rebellion. You must know that the tasks we bear on the economic battlefield are of the same importance as fighting the communists in the front. The Youth Army should have the greatest courage to engage in this arduous and historically significant great work. (End of full text)

### Women Concentrated and Distributed to Communist Troops in Qidong Along the Riverfront; Virgins Forced to Become "Temporary Wives"

[United Press International, Fourteenth Dispatch] According to residents of a certain village in Qidong, when the Communist guerrillas occupied a village along the Yangtze River estuary in the Qidong area, they concentrated all the women in the village for "distribution." During the Communist occupation of the village, each Communist soldier received a "temporary wife," and no woman who failed to escape beforehand, whether married or virgin, was spared. During the distribution, young women were assigned to older Communist soldiers, while older women were assigned to younger Communist soldiers. Those who fought bravely were assigned beautiful women.

According to residents of Chongming, although the government completely controls Chongming, because some rural areas have not yet established police stations, there are still small numbers of Communist soldiers roaming around. In a certain area, a woman was forced by Communist guerrillas to take off all her clothes and stand naked in the corridor because she expressed the hope that the National Army would eliminate the Communist soldiers.

### Genuine or Fake Divorce? Ph.D. Forgets His First Wife; Evidence Seized, Causing Disputes

[Special Dispatch from Nantong, Twelfth] A tortuous divorce case has recently occurred in this county. A man named Cao Maoliang from Caojiabu, whose family was poor, married Ge Sucheng, who had considerable savings. Cao had aspirations for further education and, with the help of his wife's dowry and ornaments, studied in England and France, earning a Ph.D. After the victory, the area fell to bandits, and Cao crossed the river, once serving in the Shanghai Police Bureau as the chief of the Economic Section. Ge fled to Nantong. Unexpectedly, Cao met a girlfriend in Shanghai and abandoned his first wife. Recently, Cao suddenly came to Nantong from Shanghai, claiming to handle divorce procedures. After the divorce announcement signed by both parties was published, Ge Sucheng published a rebuttal in the newspaper, revealing the inside story. It is said that Cao's coming to Nantong was to request a formal divorce in order to cope with the environment, and he swore "if there is any deception, may heaven and earth punish me." Two rich men from Rugao, Gu Shushan and Wang Shixiong, guaranteed it. Unexpectedly, the two guarantors published an announcement the next day, claiming that their divorce was agreed upon by both parties, and a written agreement was established and handed over to witnesses for safekeeping. It is said that when it was handed over to both parties on the third day, Ge seized the opportunity to seize the male party's agreement as well.

### Materials Adjustment Committee Resolves to Jointly Purchase Domestic Cotton; China Bank and National Private Spinning Mills Form Joint Purchase Office

[Special Dispatch] The Shanghai District Materials Adjustment Committee of the Executive Yuan's Economic Control Committee held its third meeting yesterday morning at 11:00 AM in the National Bank Conference Room. Chaired by Liu Gongyun, the meeting resolved: (1) Regarding the purchase of cotton, it was decided that the Central Bank would jointly adopt a joint purchase method with national private spinning mills in key locations. A joint purchase office would be jointly organized by state-run and nationally operated textile institutions together with the Central Bank to engage in the purchase. (2) Regarding the method of applying for permits for goods prohibited from being exported, each trade association would be responsible for reviewing and issuing permit certificates, and each association would report the quantity of goods permitted for export and the number of certificates issued to the Shanghai District Economic Control Supervisor's Office on a weekly basis for verification. Other important materials will follow the cotton purchase method, and various groups will be established under the Adjustment Committee, jointly organized by private and state-run institutions, to be responsible for adjusting raw materials and finished products.

Shanghai and Hankou Areas to Be Established First

[Further Dispatch] After the implementation of the August 19 price limit for cotton yarn, the authorities and various spinning mills felt that the price of raw materials should be reasonably controlled to maintain the new prices of finished products and raw materials, so that the cotton yarn price limit could be maintained. For this purpose, the authorities have now decided to establish a National Cotton Joint Purchase Committee, composed of one representative each from the Central Bank and national private spinning mills. The committee decided to establish a cotton joint purchase office in Shanghai to carry out the business of jointly purchasing raw cotton. It was also decided to establish a branch office in Hankou, and other locations would be set up as needed.

All Shanghai Mills Should Join

All spinning mills in the Shanghai area should join the National Cotton Joint Purchase Office. When cotton from various places is transported to Shanghai, it will be purchased uniformly by the joint purchase office, and each spinning mill may no longer purchase it separately. It is up to the spinning mills outside Shanghai to join the joint purchase office, but foreign spinning mills may entrust the joint purchase office to purchase on their behalf, so as to maintain the uniform price of national cotton. In addition to Shanghai, spinning mills in other places may still freely purchase national cotton from various places, but they must abide by the national cotton price limits in various places.

Purchase of Cotton to Be Distributed Periodically

The funds for purchasing cotton by the joint purchase office will be paid by each spinning mill in the amount of one month's worth of cotton as a down payment, and the Central Bank will also pay an equal amount of funds, with each obtaining half the amount for the purchase of national cotton. However, in principle, the Central Bank still hopes that each mill can pay more funds for purchasing cotton. The cotton that has been purchased will be distributed once every half month or one month. Matters such as the evaluation of cotton purchased by the joint purchase office will be handled centrally. As for procedures such as viewing samples, public weighing, and inspection, to be impartial, they will be entrusted to a third party to handle. It is heard that the cotton pricing will be based on: (1) the ratio of cotton prices to grain prices in the production area, so as not to harm cotton farmers; (2) the ratio of cotton prices to yarn prices, so that the prices of finished products and raw materials will not be decoupled.

### First Batch of U.S. Aid Cotton Distributed to Various Spinning Mills Starting Today

Valued at US$13 Million

[Special Dispatch] The arrangements for the distribution of the first batch of US$70 million in U.S. aid cotton in China have been prepared, and it can begin to be implemented today. The above news was jointly announced by the Director of the Cooperation Administration, Lai Puhan, and the Secretary-General of the U.S. Aid Joint Use Committee, Shen Xirui, after a meeting held yesterday afternoon between the U.S. Aid Committee's cotton group and representatives of the Cooperation Administration. Therefore, 69,878 bales of cotton can be distributed to various spinning mills in China. This cotton is the first allocation from the Cooperation Administration from April to June, valued at US$13 million. Since a basic agreement has been reached on the principles of distribution, another batch of cotton worth US$41.7 million can be distributed to Chinese spinning mills. Of the US$70 million plan, there is still US$15.3 million remaining, which will be divided into third and fourth installments, which will include October of this year to March of next year. At current prices, this amount is sufficient to purchase 100,000 bales of cotton. Therefore, the total amount of U.S. aid cotton will exceed 400,000 bales, or 200 million pounds.

### Bulk Shipment of Gauze and Cooking Oil to Guangzhou

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Central Bank's Materials and Finance Committee held its eighth meeting at 5:00 PM on the 13th, chaired by Li Lixia. It was resolved that, in order to stabilize prices in Guangzhou and strengthen the supply, the Textile Construction Company and the Central Trust Bureau should be requested to allocate and ship a large quantity of gauze and cooking oil there. As for the export of frozen eggs in the autumn of this year, the request of the Frozen Egg Industry Association has been approved, and the industry will raise funds on its own to manufacture them for export.

Another report: According to the General Manager of the China Textile Company, Shu Yunzhang, after the restriction on the export of South China gauze from this city, the source has gradually become scarce. A telegram has been sent to the company urging it to quickly ship 2,000 bales of cotton yarn and 200,000 bolts of cloth to supply the market. Currently, the export of gauze and cloth from both state-owned and private enterprises must be approved by the authorities. This batch of gauze and cloth will begin to be shipped south as soon as it is approved by the Supervisory Office.

Furthermore, the company, which was originally a special company, has now been ordered to be sold. A board meeting will be convened this week to decide on the matter of reorganizing it into a limited company. If one-tenth of the shares are sold, a shareholders' meeting will be convened to re-elect directors and supervisors in accordance with the company's regulations. Regardless of whether they are government shares or commercial shares, all will enjoy rights and bear obligations in accordance with the Company Law. The Central Bank is planning to handle the sale of shares in other cities.

### Hakka Merchants' Actual Sales Lackluster, Cotton Yarn Prices Decline, Cloth Sales Improve, Market Slightly Lively

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw tightening credit among the industry. Furthermore, with the actual demand from major Hakka merchants being lackluster, yarn dealers experienced weak sales. Most businesses were selling more than they were buying, resulting in a sluggish market atmosphere.

Transactions in the market were mostly for 10-count and 20-count coarse yarns, with prices declining gradually within the limits. Various fine yarns were abundantly supplied, and the weaving industry absorbed them well, keeping the market stable. 21-count Double Horse yarn fell to 750 yuan, a significant drop of 27 yuan compared to the previous day. Yarns below 20-count also fell by varying amounts, from 5-6 yuan to 10 yuan. Coarse yarns traded around 20 yuan within the price limit.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market, after consecutive days of decline, mostly retreated into the price limits. Hakka merchants, due to the export ban, still made few large purchases. Local stores and shops supplied for actual sales in the cool autumn, frequently absorbing stock. The market saw a surge in buying interest, and prices rose slightly.

12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth initially opened lower by 3 jiao (0.3 yuan). Subsequently, news spread that the Cloth Industry Association had requested permission from the Materials Adjustment Committee for export, and that approval for shipment was likely. It was also learned that the authorities stipulated that each person could carry two bolts when leaving the country. Shops in other cities needed goods, and "single-handedly" peddlers actively sought them out, causing Dragon Head prices to rebound to 26.8 yuan at closing, a 3 jiao improvement compared to the previous day.

Four Gentlemen Yuan Bi Ji (a type of fabric) saw surprisingly strong demand from local stores, with prices rising by more than one yuan. In addition, low-end secondary brand B-character fine cloth and Yuan Zhi Gong (another type of fabric) also saw prices become brisk. Total transaction volume for the day was around 1,600 bolts.

Another report: The Textile Construction Company opened sales of Five Fortunes fine cloth at a price of 23.9 yuan per bolt, and Taoyuangang Yuan fine cloth, Four Gentlemen Yellow Card, and other grades of Zhi Gong呢 (a type of wool fabric),坯布(unfinished cloth), sheets and other items, totaling 13 kinds. Most applicants were local cloth stores, and there were more requests for Five Fortunes and large-size fine cloth.

### If There Are Doubts About Gold Exchange, Applications Can Be Made for Joint Re-verification

[Our Newspaper's Report] Recently, there have been complaints from various places regarding the Central Bank's gold exchange, such as excessively high requirements for fineness, congestion and time consumption. Our reporter specially visited the person in charge of the Central Bank, who stated that the congestion situation has improved since the authorization of four banks to handle the exchange. As for the gold fineness, it is in accordance with government regulations, and the bank cannot arbitrarily change it. In order to improve the efficiency of the exchange, a telegram has been sent to all branches stating that the fineness or quantity should not be deliberately reduced. After the appraisal, if the person making the exchange has doubts, they should be allowed to apply for joint re-verification. Gold ingots manufactured by the Central Mint, unless there are special reasons (such as tampering or counterfeiting), should be verified and exchanged according to the original fineness listed by the factory. All efforts should be made to facilitate the exchange for those holding gold.

### Credit Conditions Remain Loose

Yesterday, the credit conditions in local silver shops remained loose. The National Bank Treasury had a deficit of 650,000 yuan in the exchange of notes among silver and money businesses. Among them, the Central Bank alone had the largest deficit of 1.45 million yuan, the Bank of China had a surplus of 1.33 million yuan, the Bank of Communications had a deficit of 600,000 yuan, the Farmers Bank had a deficit of 160,000 yuan, the Central Trust Bureau had a surplus of 550,000 yuan, the Postal Savings Bureau had a deficit of 260,000 yuan, and the Central Cooperative Treasury had a deficit of 60,000 yuan. Commercial banks had a surplus of 280,000 yuan in the large exchange, a deficit of 270,000 yuan in the small exchange, and foreign banks totaled 640,000 yuan.

### Poor Sales, Sluggish Transactions: Rice Prices Stagnant, Flour Prices Fall, Cooking Oil Market Plunges

The rice market remained weak and sluggish. Although the supply of new goods was scarce, the sales remained poor, resulting in sluggish transactions and stagnant prices. In the southern market, upper and middle-grade goods managed to hold their ground, but overnight white glutinous rice fell by 0.5 yuan, and upland rice fell slightly by 0.1 yuan. The supply of new rice from Pudong increased, but sales were slow, and the price was 0.2 yuan lower. White Yuan rice remained at the original price of 20.066 yuan. In the northern market, the prices of various types of rice were almost unchanged from the previous day, showing signs of stability. Yesterday, 970 shi of rice arrived in the southern market, and 1,170 shi in the northern market.

Flour

Continued to see a slight decline. Actual sales were scarce, and sales in the inland areas stagnated, resulting in poor sales. Old Car flour was 7.5 yuan, a drop of 0.05 yuan. Warship flour fell by 0.03 yuan, Jiancheng flour fell by 0.03 yuan, and miscellaneous brands of flour fell by varying amounts, from 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. Wheat bran continued to fall by 0.03 yuan. Wheat remained at the original price of 10.03 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

Continued on a weak path. Demand was sluggish, and actual sales remained weak. In the local market, new soybeans sold better and prices remained stable. Vehicle beans and Zha beans fell by 0.3-0.5 yuan due to poor factory demand. Vehicle beans closed at 11.3 yuan. Corn saw weak demand from northern merchants and fell by 0.2-0.3 yuan. There were still only a few transactions in Yuan wheat. Very little Tea beans opened. Red sorghum rose by 0.3 yuan due to purchases from Shantou and Xiamen merchants. Sesame fell by 0.5 yuan. Raw kernels are not opening.

Cooking Oil

The price drop was rampant, especially for raw oil, which saw the largest decline. Jilong raw oil plunged to 60 yuan, a sharp drop of 3 yuan. Bean oil factories reduced production, and spot prices fell by 1 yuan. Rapeseed oil fell by 0.5-1 yuan, because since the suspension of exports, supply has suddenly exceeded demand. Large raw oil dealers were selling off their stock, causing the most dramatic decline. Small cart sesame oil also sharply fell by 2 yuan. The bean cake market turned slightly firmer, as merchants made some purchases.

### Nearly 3 Million Yuan of State-Owned Enterprise Stocks Sold

On the 14th, agent banks sold a total of 400,440 yuan in Jin Yuan of state-owned enterprise stocks from five units, including Textile Construction and China Merchants. Among them, Textile Construction accounted for 284,500 yuan, Taiwan Sugar 100,900 yuan, and Taiwan Paper 10,000 yuan.

It is also learned that since the start of sales on the 10th, the above stocks have sold a total of 2,963,900 yuan in Jin Yuan, including 2,094,000 yuan for Textile Construction, 761,100 yuan for Taiwan Sugar, 22,500 yuan for China Merchants, 82,300 yuan for Taiwan Paper, and 400 yuan for Tianjin Paper.

### Tianjin's Exports Increased Sharply Last Month

[Central News Agency Tianjin, 14th] Tianjin's export value increased sharply in August. According to statistics from the Tianjin Commercial Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the total value of export goods inspected and approved in August was 3,970,268.04 yuan in Jin Yuan. Pig bristles still accounted for the vast majority, totaling 3,115,602.27 yuan. In comparison, Tianjin's total export value in July was over 47,669 billion yuan in legal tender.

### Detailed Procedures for Applying for Export Permits to be Announced Today

According to information from the Economic Supervision Office, the office attaches great importance to the export ban. It had previously formulated procedures for applying for permits, which are now finalized. For the sake of caution and to achieve coordination in the work, the procedures have been submitted to the secretariats of the Inspection and Materials Adjustment Committees for joint study to ensure they are comprehensive. It is expected that the procedures may be officially approved and implemented today (the 15th).

It is believed that after implementation, closer cooperation can be achieved between various departments, which will facilitate promotion. The portion of goods detained for inspection at the North Station in recent days can also be processed quickly. If it is deemed that there is no conflict with the procedures, they can be returned to the original owners.

### Western Tea Market Stable

Yesterday, the Western tea market was still actively sought after by export merchants. The process was quite lively, but unfortunately, due to scarce supply, transactions remained small, and prices remained quite stable.

It is learned that, in order to actively expand the direct export of Chinese tea, local Chinese export firms have not only sent letters to Europe, but have also compiled samples and sent them abroad for promotion. It is also reported that China Airlines will have a special flight to Africa on the 16th of this month, and tea merchants are preparing to send a large number of samples of Chun Mee green tea, Zhen Mei green tea, and other goods to that region. As for domestic tea, the balance between supply and demand has remained relatively stable.

### Production Area Prices Rise, Overseas Tung Oil Market Weakens

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Export Management Committee announced yesterday: This week (September 6-11), Shanghai's controls were strict, and the situation was roughly the same as last week. However, the inventory of various goods gradually became low, and transactions inevitably became sluggish. Overseas market conditions were generally stable. The overseas market for tung oil, one of the main export products, continued to show improvement. On Tuesday, the New York market rose to US$0.2025 per pound. Unfortunately, domestic tung oil production area prices rose, resulting in a scarce supply of goods and sluggish transactions. Also, according to a London telegram on the weekend, the local oil market weakened, and importers' buying prices were slightly lower, with barrelled oil at £152 per long ton and bulk oil at only £144.

### Li Ximou Writes to Public and Private School Teachers and Staff: Expand the Number of Free Places for Needy Students; Don't Focus on Tuition Fees and Salaries, and Disregard Students Dropping Out of School

[Our Newspaper's Report] Li Ximou, acting director of the city's Education Bureau, in order to implement the City Council's resolution on the issue of students applying for tuition reductions and waivers, yesterday issued an open letter to all principals, teachers, and staff of public and private primary and secondary schools in the city. The letter stated:

Recently, there has been much criticism in public opinion about a small number of schools overcharging tuition and miscellaneous fees; students applying for tuition reductions and waivers are often rejected or reprimanded by teachers, which has aroused the indignation of many parents. The regulations regarding the number of tuition reductions and waivers are decided by the City Council, and the Municipal Government and the Education Bureau are only implementing agencies for these resolutions.

Distorted Concepts Must Be Corrected

When approving the fee standards for each semester, the estimated income of the school is taken into account, and the number of students with tuition reductions and waivers has already been deducted. Therefore, schools setting the number of tuition reductions and waivers according to regulations will not affect the salaries of teachers and staff. Teachers in private schools in this city often believe that increasing the number of free students reduces revenue, and some principals even use this to deceive teachers. This distorted concept must be corrected so that teachers do not harbor resentment towards free students. This is the first point.

Unlimited Expansion of Free Places

Private schools advocate that tuition standards should not be restricted. In principle, the Education Bureau originally expressed sympathy, but the prerequisite is that poor students will not drop out of school due to high tuition fees. To achieve this goal, private schools must expand the number of free places without limit. If high tuition fees pose a threat of students dropping out of school, and if the attitude of school teachers towards expanding the number of free places does not change, then unrestricted tuition fees in private schools, given the current economic strength of the general public, do pose a great danger of causing a large number of students to drop out of school. This is the second point.

Empathize with the Difficult Times and Show More Sympathy

Now that the semester has already begun, poor students are worried about tuition fees and face many difficulties, wandering on divergent paths, which is very pitiful. In order to implement the resolution of the City Council, the Education Bureau will provide assistance to poor students who request tuition waivers, whether the student applies directly to the school or the Education Bureau forwards a notice, unless the school verifies and proves that they are not poor, in order to ensure that they enjoy free tuition and avoid dropping out of school. Principals and teachers of all schools should also empathize with the difficult times and show more sympathy to poor students, and should not use excuses to evade responsibility or falsely claim that the quota is full and refuse to accept them. This is the third point.

The Responsibility of the Educational Community if a Student Drops Out of School

In short, schools are for nurturing young people, and the responsibility for a student dropping out of school lies with the educational community. "From the one who brought me a bundle of dried meat upwards, I have never refused instruction to anyone," is Confucius' educational spirit. Focusing on the level of tuition fees and the richness of salaries, and viewing the problem of young people dropping out of school as if it has nothing to do with me, is definitely not the attitude that our educational community should have. May all principals, teachers, and staff of our public and private schools, together with the Education Bureau, be vigilant and encourage each other.

### Cheng Qibao Appointed Director of the Liaison Education Department

[Our Newspaper's Report from Nanjing on the 14th] Cheng Qibao, secretary of the Chinese Committee of the International Liaison Education Organization, has been hired by the International Liaison Education Organization as the Director of the Education Department. Mr. Cheng is scheduled to go to Paris at the end of this month or the beginning of next month to take office.

### Scholarships Awaiting Roster Verification, General Manager of the Unified Review Committee Speaks

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to Zheng Jie, general manager of the Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee, recently some students from various schools have sent letters to the committee requesting that scholarships for this semester be issued in advance, and the committee expresses its deep sympathy for this suggestion. However, in fact, in order to advance the scholarship issuance date, the school authorities must submit the roster of free students for this semester as early as possible, otherwise the committee will not be able to review them in advance. The greatest purpose of the committee's scholarship program is to encourage schools to accommodate as many free students as possible so that they can reach the free quota stipulated by the City Council (20% for private middle schools and 25% for private primary schools), so that all poor students in the city can receive appropriate relief. Therefore, if the committee issues scholarships in advance before the schools submit the roster of free students, it will not only lose the original intention of the committee's scholarship program, but it will also be the same as sending scholarships to schools that generally do not meet the free quota.

### Jianguo School of Law and Commerce Approved for Registration, Northeast Zhongzheng University Discontinued

[Our Newspaper's Report from Nanjing on the 14th] The Ministry of Education has approved the registration of the Nanjing Private Jianguo School of Law and Commerce because it has been operating for more than a year and its equipment, funding, teachers, and other items are satisfactory. In addition, the Shenyang Private Northeast Zhongzheng University has been unable to maintain operations due to the tense situation in the Northeast, the influx of students into the customs, and the school's financial difficulties. The school's board of directors has submitted a request to the Ministry of Education for approval to discontinue operations. In addition, the Jilin Provincial Zhongzheng Physical Education College has had no news since it withdrew from Yongji this spring. The Ministry of Education has learned from a report from the Provincial Education Department that it has already been discontinued.

### Talking About Books

— Jingwen

Recently, articles about books have frequently appeared in this publication: airing books, losing books, selling books. However, one rarely sees anyone discussing buying books, which shows the widespread poverty of today's literati. Although most of the contributors to this publication are not professional writers (I suspect), this further illustrates the hardship in the lives of honorable and upright individuals. Before the war, buying a few volumes of the "Modern Series" or other single publications was not difficult. At that time, one U.S. dollar was worth only three yuan. Currently, after the gold yuan conversion, although the ratio is only one to four, the income of the average salaried person is far less than before the war.

Personally, although I have a stable job, I repeatedly pass bookstores without entering. Fortunately, I still have some books in storage. If I read them one by one, I will have several years of entertainment. I must thank myself for running to bookstores during my past, more economically prosperous times. I can still keep two shelves of books to slightly decorate my humble abode today.

Although I enjoyed buying books in the past, I never had a bibliophile's obsession with collecting. Therefore, the number of books I have lost over the years is several times greater than the few dozen I currently possess. Thinking about it now, I feel deep regret. I haven't even kept a few of my own writing and translation works from recent years. However, I often believe that everything is ultimately external, and knowledge should especially belong to the public. Personal book collecting, becoming an obsession, can only be seen as a morbid possessiveness. How can a person digest thousands of books in their lifetime? However, before public libraries become widespread, private collections have their value in preserving cultural artifacts. But if book collecting is viewed as private property, then this significance is lost.

Because I have such views on books, I have never liked buying complete works. Sometimes I only bought the upper or lower volume. Some might find this laughable. But my opinion is that a person's life is limited, and how can one read all the books in the world? And no matter how remarkable an author is, not every book they write is worth reading. Unless one is specifically dedicated to a particular school of thought and knowledge, then reading a person's complete works is quite boring.

Of course, things like complete works have their reference value, even for those who don't specialize in that field. But speaking of reference, it brings to mind the utilitarian view of reading. Those who are good at reference work probably read with a purpose, such as helping with their own writing, teaching materials, and research. Reading with a purpose, although not entirely negative, ultimately belongs to the realm of the concrete. Books and the knowledge they inspire are merely tools for achieving a specific goal in this context, and the spiritual enjoyment is lost. Personally, I believe that the value of books lies precisely in this spiritual enjoyment.

However, due to the pressure of life, opportunities for reading for spiritual enjoyment are becoming fewer and fewer each day. I am even reduced to considering whether a magazine can provide material for writing or translation before buying it. This situation is both hateful and pitiable. Someone once said that "writing books is originally for the sake of rice and beams," but I never thought that even reading would be linked to the need for household rice!

I dare not assume that readers should be aloof and virtuous. If a person wants to take from society, they must also contribute to society, which is fair and reasonable. Therefore, even if reading is linked to utilitarian views, there is nothing shameful about it. Moreover, we have always believed in the saying that "books contain golden houses," "thousands of bushels of grain," and "beautiful women like jade"; the scholar-officials of the imperial examination era considered "excelling in learning leads to officialdom" as self-evident. However, if people have spiritual needs that satisfy themselves beyond their material lives, it cannot be considered an excessive demand, right?

However, this is like a dream today. I have an article clipped from the "New York Times" on my desk, waiting to be "assigned a role." If words have become whips to enslave oneself, then what joy and enjoyment is there in reading!

### Restaurant

— Mengqiu

I saw an old friend in a restaurant after ten years of separation.

It is certainly a happy occasion, but it is surprisingly difficult to talk as freely as we did ten years ago, laughing without regard for others. Apart from the most cliched greetings, there is simply nothing to say.

The "worldliness" learned in ten years seems to consist of only one sentence: don't hurt others. Therefore, even with people we know very well and crave to see every day, meeting is like two skilled boxers. After the bell rings, everyone tests and tests, avoids and avoids, with deep caution. Occasionally, like a dragonfly skimming the water, there is only a "touch," and then the topic is shifted far away. Or, we stop at a superficial mention.

I can't help but think painfully: Old X, this time it's over. It was a waste for us to have met!

Suddenly, he told me in a leisurely tone that Mr. H had died in the War of Resistance. The unit he joined had fallen into the enemy's trap, and the sacrifices were quite heavy. The face of the shrewd and capable H appeared before my eyes. Such a first-class talent!

I drank silently, forgetting that I was still in a restaurant in Shanghai. Suddenly, I looked up and saw him looking at me too.

There are too many times for acting; even when the mask is taken off, he still thinks I'm acting.

Only "time" can explain everything.

### Bathtub

— Cangyu

The first bathtub in the United States was shipped from England in 1820. The form of that bathtub is impossible to verify. But many people thought it was a novelty, and its owner, Whitena, displayed it in his front yard for people to visit. In 1842, Thomson, a cotton and grain manager, was the first to install a bathtub in his home. On December 20, 1842, he invited many guests to his home for dinner, followed by bathing. The next day, major newspapers attacked the practice, believing that bathing in a bathtub was harmful to health. Doctors generally insisted on their prejudices, saying that bathing in a bathtub could cause rheumatism, pneumonia, and other diseases. Many people also proposed banning the use of bathtubs, arguing that all households with bathtubs should be taxed 30 yuan per year.

### Song on White Biao's Large Calligraphy in Yun Jian

— Shen Yuzhong

I praise Uncle Fan's poetry, capable of depicting the marvels of Yun Jian. (Uncle Fan's poem to Bai Jiao praised his calligraphy and painting) Jian is originally a poet, skilled in painting, exhausting his inkstone. Puyong's famous brush gathers in your wrist, orthodox calligraphy can rise to revive the art, a heroic calligrapher is born rarely, so I know that Wang's spirit is now here. Zhong Wang's calligraphy falls into ordinary hands, the pace is cramped and difficult to drive, the common vulgar arguments follow each other, thus the ancestral method is obscured. Watching your large calligraphy spread, the large size is as you wish, it is naturally the original energy in the brushwork, the furnace is in your hands, everything is solid. In recent years, the suffering of war has not yet ended, the brush has no plan to collect the bruise, gathering worries and anger by the wine and lamp, stretching paper and seeing the divine moment. Who in the world will understand the scholar's intentions, what are you doing piling up the retired brushes!

### Poet Yi Ku An

— Chen Zuogao

Mr. Longyang Yi Ku An has been famous for his poetic talent for a long time, especially his works such as You Yang and Chu Ji, which are extremely exquisite and unparalleled. Master Fang Chong Shen of Tongcheng was a friend of his in the Old Capital Liushuiyin, and their friendship was quite deep. He said that Ku An's poems and lyrics were always composed on the bed, on the toilet, or in the car, either reclining and thinking, or 　藩 writing, or 　軾 obtaining a phrase, all completed instantly, faster than Zi Jian, hence the name "Three Ups."

When he was off duty, he often frequented the flower district, boasting of his romantic escapades. He claimed that in the year of Ren Yin, he was dismissed and sent to Guangxi Youjiang Road. When he took office, he rode in a green sedan chair, with his wife in front and followers behind. Before dusk, on the way to a certain village in Xianggui, he saw a soy milk shop, and the proprietress was looking out the door, with a beautiful and elegant appearance, shining brightly, fully expressing the state of bending over and showing her missing teeth. He then ordered a stop next to the shop and politely asked to stay for the night. The proprietress happily welcomed him, slaughtering chickens and cooking rice, and preparing a bed in the boudoir. In the evening, Ku An raised his glass and drank freely, sending away his servants in the distance, leaving only the woman to serve him. When he was drunk, he showed his intentions, and the woman also thought that he had a dragon-like appearance and a phoenix-like quality, and was very lucky to have met him, so she allowed him to rely on her. At dawn, when he woke up from his drunkenness, he suddenly changed his expression, fearing that it would not be tolerated by her husband. He said: "If this matter is reported, what will happen to my position!" The woman said calmly: "It doesn't matter. My husband knows that you are a noble person, and he feels honored that you have visited our humble home. He doesn't mind these details." After a while, her husband actually willingly stayed outside, working as usual. Afterwards, Ku An often told people about this, always calling it the most satisfying thing in his life.

In the early Republic of China, disasters occurred frequently in a certain province, and sorrowful cries were heard everywhere. A charity sale was held at the Old Capital Natong Flower Garden, and all the famous ladies and girls of Pingjin gathered there. Mrs. Xiong Xiling, Tang Zaili, and others were all invited to participate. Ku An and Han Yun also went together. The next morning, the newspaper published poems about a certain event, actually listing the two ladies as famous courtesans, with a poem attached to each. At that time, Zaili was in power, and when he found out, he was furious and mobilized his forces, finally causing Ku An to flee to Tianjin and disappear for almost a month.

When Yuan Xiangcheng was in power, he went to the Old Capital again to assist Yuan Bo 　 (Siliang) and served as a counselor in the Printing Bureau. Every weekend, he would go to Tianjin and Gu, visiting the courtesan Li Sangu, and their relationship was very close, with frequent visits. At that time, the Donganshi photography studio in the Old Capital had a huge portrait of Sangu hanging there; Ku An would often sit alone in the 　 surface noodle shop, staring at it intently for a long time. Observing the contemporary women described in his collection, all of them were said to be beautiful enough to overthrow kingdoms and as beautiful as red clouds, but when he actually saw them, most of them had repulsive faces, either Dong Shi or Wu Yan. Could it be that he was implicitly implying the meaning of a colorful brush creating flowers? I remember that Uncle Cheng Zida (Song Wan) of Ningxiang, who had a marriage relationship with him, wrote a tomb inscription and a catalog of his collections for him, repeatedly praising Ku An as a man of benevolence in the world, knowing to abide by the rules, but at the end of the article, there was a sentence "receiving prostitutes, like eating and drinking, cannot be abolished," which probably refers to what Master Chong Shen said? Ku An's name was Shun Ding, his style name was Shifu, also Zhongshi, and because he mourned the death of his mother, weeping like ointment, he was named Ku An.

### About Gromyko

— Yungong

Recently, I read in the newspaper that Mrs. Lappin, the director of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration's China Branch, flew from the United States to Shanghai to reunite with her husband. Mrs. Lappin is energetic, a capable wife, and quite famous in American social circles. One day, Soviet Foreign Minister and former UN Representative Gromyko met Mrs. Lappin at a banquet. Mrs. Lappin asked him, "What do you think of American women?" Gromyko replied with a straight face, "They make no impression on me." Seeing that the conversation was not going well, Mrs. Lappin was about to turn away when Gromyko immediately explained, "Mrs. Lappin, I was joking with you."

In addition, there are several humorous remarks by Gromyko circulating in the American press. For example:

Someone asked him what he thought of a feature article about him in the New York Times. He replied that half of it was true and half was fiction because the New York Times is a moderate newspaper, and this report was to be expected.

When he heard someone mention his youth, he retorted, "How many years do you have to live in America to be considered 'old'?"

One time, an American reporter called his home, and his daughter answered. The reporter asked to speak to her father. She replied, "He's not home."

"Do you know where he went?"

"I don't know. I never know where he is. He has never mentioned a word about his movements in front of me."

### Polo

— Gongsun Wu

Han Yu and Zhang Jianfeng played polo, and there were poems and petitions given to Zhang. Polo was a military exercise, especially to train riding skills; the method is not detailed, but it must be riding a horse to chase the ball, hitting it with a stick, the ball is not big, but very strong. Today, Westerners have a horse polo game, I wonder if it is the same as our ancient method. There is no horse polo in the National Games, because the original skills have long been lost, and there is also a preference for imitating others. Reading Mr. Han's poems, you can still imagine the heroism of the Tang people. The poem says, "Building a court a thousand steps flat as a knife, three sides of short walls circling, "this is the polo court. "Hundreds of horses gather their hooves and reflect each other, the ball startles the stick and separates," again, "leaning to the side and turning the arm to the horse's belly, the thunder should be in the hand of the divine pearl galloping," the hitting method is roughly like this. The second letter to Zhang Puye says, "Those who say polo is harmful must say that there are worries about dangerous roads and fears of shooting, the small ones hurt the face, the big ones damage the body," again, "Using it (referring to the horse) to play polo in the arena, shaking the heart and lungs, vibrating the muscles and bones, the breath cannot come in and out, the walking cannot be returned, the far ones three or four years, the near ones one or two years, there are no whole horses, then the harm of polo to people is decided. This is the real view of ancient scholars, all competitions must have small harms to people, if you see the small harm and do not see the big benefit, then you say that sports games should be abolished, it is really ignorant. However, exercise should avoid excess, his argument about horses is right, today the British make this game, people must prepare three or four horses, about fifteen minutes to change horses once.

### Lessons from Traffic Safety Campaign

— Mao Yi

The Shanghai Municipal Authorities are again promoting a traffic safety campaign these past few days. The annual "Traffic Safety Week" has been around for several years, but although it cannot be said to be completely superficial, the results are far from what was expected. Traffic congestion in busy areas remains the same, and vehicle accidents are still frequently heard. These are all in urgent need of improvement and greater effort. The small American city of East also used to be a traffic-congested city. This small city with a population of only 70,000, because of its proximity to Chicago, has the traffic of a metropolis with a population of 500,000. But through the efforts of Franklin Klim, who came from the ranks of traffic police on duty, the city was able to go without a single traffic fatality in 1945. And in four years, it won the "National Safety Council" award three times, being recognized as the safest city of the same size.

Klim's first task was to appoint a qualified expert as a "traffic engineer" to focus on the problem of speeding up traffic congestion.

He first persuaded the merchants on the main road to carry out loading and unloading operations between midnight and 6 a.m., because loading and unloading goods during the day is a major cause of traffic obstruction. The merchants complied, and the traffic situation immediately improved significantly.

Secondly, Mr. K appealed for the cooperation of employers to stagger the hours of work, not everyone leaving work at the same time. In this way, the peak of traffic congestion that occurs when people leave work is reduced.

For the safety of pedestrians, the police politely used loudspeakers to discourage them from crossing red lights, crossing intersections at oblique angles, or crossing the street in the middle of the road.

At intersections, the curbs were rounded to make it easier and faster for drivers to turn. Several roads were restricted to one-way traffic only, increasing both traffic capacity and speed.

The changes in traffic lights are timed so that cars traveling at 27 miles per hour will encounter a green light at every intersection. Parking on narrow streets is allowed on one side only, and parking time in busy areas is reduced from one hour or one and a half hours to half an hour.

Now, Mr. K has become a university "professor". He is the Dean of the Traffic Academy at Northwestern University. There are nearly 2,000 graduates, distributed in various states in the United States and Central America and Canada, specializing in solving traffic problems.

### Reader Mr. Zheng Urgently Seeks Employment

To the Editor: After graduating from the Department of Industrial Management, I was employed as the Director of Affairs and a Chinese Language teacher at a British secondary school. My income was sufficient to cover my wife's midwifery training expenses and the living expenses of my two children. Unexpectedly, the supervisor was transferred this semester, and I lost my job, which has resulted in my wife being unable to complete her one year of schooling and the hunger of my two children is even more unbearable! I respectfully write this letter to ask your newspaper to publish it in the social services column. If a kind person could introduce a job to me so that I can maintain a livelihood and support my wife's studies, I will definitely work hard to repay them. If there are letters of sympathy and assistance, please leave them at the service column of your newspaper! Respectfully submitted,

Sincerely, Zheng Shizhen, September 5
