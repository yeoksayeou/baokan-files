### Presidents and Professors of Colleges and Universities in Shanghai Oppose U.S. Support for Japan; Joint Telegram Sent to Truman and Marshall

[Our Dispatch] Ding Wenyuan, Zhu Jingnong, Li Shouyong, Hu Dunfu, Ling Xianyang, Zhang Yi, Cheng Xiaogang, Liu Haisu, Pan Xulun, Ou Yuanhuai, and 338 other presidents and professors of colleges and universities in Shanghai have recently expressed their views on the United States' support for Japan by jointly sending a letter to U.S. President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall yesterday. A circular was also sent to the education community nationwide seeking their agreement. The original text is as follows:

To U.S. President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall,

We, the undersigned, are of the view that the recent proposals by certain responsible officials in your country for dealing with Japan may lead to serious errors. We wish to offer our humble opinions from the standpoint of candid friends. We would like to state first that Sino-American relations are very close and the friendship between the peoples of the two countries is harmonious and seamless. Any statements we make regarding your policies will be made in complete sincerity and goodwill.

Your country's policy towards Japan, which takes into account the basic living needs of the Japanese people and prevents them from falling into poverty, is based on humanitarian principles and is consistent with our country's policy of leniency towards the Japanese people. However, your country has recently shown a tendency to allow Japan to increase its industry to above pre-war levels and to provide it with substantial material and financial assistance. This is not necessary. As for rebuilding Japan as an industrial center in the Far East and making China and other Asian countries its raw material supply base and its dumping market for manufactured goods, the ambition that Japan held when it launched the East Asian War will be brought to fruition by your country. Would not the sacrifices made by China in its eight years of arduous resistance to this ambition, and the loss of life and property suffered by your country during the war against Japan, be equivalent to waste?

China was the first to resist Japan's war of aggression, fought for the longest time, and suffered the most damage. The living conditions of the Chinese people are even worse than those of the Japanese people. However, your country's assistance to China, after much consideration, is not as generous as your country's assistance to Japan. When we recall that our two countries were allies fighting side by side for democracy, and that Japan was the enemy that attacked your country's vital points by shameless means and killed and wounded your country's soldiers, we are truly bewildered and unable to understand your country's current policy of supporting Japan. If judged by justice, we firmly believe that your country should transfer the aid used to support Japan to China.

If some people in your country harbor the illusion that a resurrected Japan can become your country's ally and can serve as a democratic fortress and a force for stability in East Asia, then we are very willing to expose this illusion. Japan has not changed in essence before and after the war. Its authorities have no real determination to implement democracy, other than using various deceptive means to appear obedient in order to win the favor of your country's personnel stationed in Japan. The lurking forces of its old militarists still exist. If it is allowed to maintain its heavy industrial infrastructure and given the opportunity to rearm, then the Pearl Harbor incident will surely be repeated once its wings are fully grown. Your country's observation of the situation in the Far East is sometimes inevitably isolated. We still remember that since the September 18th Incident, your country has repeatedly ignored the appeals of Chinese people, which led to an unprecedented catastrophe. Today, as we face the resurgence of the crisis, we must do our best to provide you with our loyal advice, and we sincerely hope that you will adopt it.

To seek world peace, East Asia must first be stabilized. To seek stability in East Asia, there must be an independent and strong China. Your country's far-sighted people all hold this view. This grand strategy should not be abandoned because of China's current difficult situation. The Chinese people will always love peace. China is moving in the direction of democracy. The vast majority of the Chinese people are willing to be friends with the United States. Only China can be an ideal force for stabilizing East Asia and does not conflict with the wishes of the United States. We earnestly hope that your country will resolutely abandon its plan to support Japan. Concentrate your efforts and accelerate aid to China with more materials. Enable China to embark on the road to construction as soon as possible. We firmly believe that only by practical mutual assistance between China and the United States, and by jointly cooperating with other democratic countries in the world, can the foundation for lasting world peace be laid.

### President Expresses Satisfaction at Restoration of Stability in Queshan; National Army Achieves Great Victory in Sweeping Operations in Eastern Henan

[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 31st] The bandits in the eastern border of Shan County in western Henan fled in the direction of Luoning and Mianchi. The local forces captured Guanyintang last night and advanced eastward into the territory of Guochi County.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 31st] The National Army in eastern Henan launched a full-scale sweeping operation yesterday, and most of the bandits lurking in the Huaiyang, Taikang, and Xihua areas were eliminated.

### Youth Party Statement

[Our Dispatch] The Youth Party Office announced last night: Recent reports in the newspapers about the Youth Party's participation in the list of candidates for the new cabinet are purely speculative.

### Supervisory Yuan Preparatory Committee Holds Fourth Meeting Yesterday; Many Supervisory Committee Members Still Advocate for Yu Youren as President

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The Supervisory Yuan Preparatory Committee held its fourth meeting today. The attendees included Chairman Liu Zhe, Secretary-General Li Chunshi, and committee members Ren Bingjun, Zhu Zongliang, and Li Zhengle, among more than twenty others. Chairman Liu Zhe announced the minutes of the last meeting and the Secretary's Office reported on the progress of the preparatory work. They then exchanged views on: (1) the method of electing the President and Vice President of the Supervisory Yuan by the Supervisory Committee members, (2) the rules of procedure for the Supervisory Yuan meetings, (3) the Supervisory Law, and (4) the organizational law of the various committees of the Supervisory Yuan.

According to Committee Member Zhu and others, "The position of President of the Supervisory Yuan is extremely important for the future of constitutional government. Mr. Yu is a founding elder and has presided over the Supervisory Yuan for many years, making him the most ideal candidate. As for Mr. Yu's remarks yesterday, they were merely his personal expression of humility. However, each Supervisory Committee member has a free right to elect, entrusted by the people. If Mr. Yu is elected as President, it is his duty, and we believe that he will not refuse."

### Shandong National Army Conducts Strategic Maneuvers; Abandoned Tai'an and Feicheng on the Previous Day; Intense Fighting Continues in Wand and Dakou

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 31st] Chen Yi's bandits attacked Tai'an on the night of the 29th but were repelled. However, because the bandit forces occupied Motianling east of Tai'an, the defending troops in the city were in an unfavorable position. On the night of the 30th, they proactively withdrew from the county seat and continued to strike the bandits on the defensive line west of the city. Furthermore, several sections of the southern section of the Jinpu Railway have been damaged by bandits, and we are dispatching troops to search and eliminate them.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 31st] The National Army in the central section of the Jinpu Railway, in order to adopt absolute strategic maneuvers, voluntarily abandoned Tai'an and Feicheng at 4:00 PM and 9:00 PM respectively on the 30th. On the 31st, fighting continued in Wand and Dakou to the north and south. Although the bandits suffered heavy losses and gained these two empty cities, they actually gained nothing. The National Army is now waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. Furthermore, it is reported that three of the seven bandit columns on the north bank of the Yellow River in western Shandong have crossed the river and fled south to the vicinity of Yuncheng. The periphery of Xingzhou and the Yan-Xu section of the Jinpu Railway are also becoming tense.

Editorial

### Recent Commentary on Educational Trends

Since the establishment of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), special attention has been given to the reconstruction of education and youth in countries damaged by war. Therefore, much sympathy and importance is attached to the current state of education in China. Recently, Mr. Aubry, commissioned by UNESCO to investigate education in China, has completed his investigation in Shanghai and proceeded to the capital. He will then go to various places such as Peiping, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Hankou, and Guangzhou for detailed investigation and research. In light of this, we can easily think of the current state of education in various departments of our country, especially the recent student strikes in several universities. This may give a bad impression to educators from friendly countries who sympathize with us. However, we believe that Mr. Aubry's longer and more detailed observations will not be limited to superficial appearances. In addition to urban areas, he will also look at rural areas. In addition to dynamic aspects, he will also examine static aspects. In particular, he will recognize the various internal and external difficulties faced by Chinese education, and the reconstruction achievements and progress made in the midst of hardship. We would like to take this opportunity to make some brief comments on the current trends in national education, secondary education, and higher education for discussion.

The "basic education" that UNESCO emphasizes is mainly national education in China. In the wartime and the three years after the war, it can be said that steady and substantial progress has been made in poverty and hardship. We must thank the advocacy of some education experts and the unyielding efforts of countless national school teachers. Although we were in the midst of the War of Resistance, national education achieved good results in both system and substance. However, after the restoration, national education was greatly restricted by financial difficulties under the circumstances of public and private difficulties. Therefore, the government's allocation of 800 billion yuan to local basic education funds is truly an important matter for current education to meet needs. This fund is included in the national budget. The Ministry of Education only officially disclosed it in March, and a local basic education symposium was held in early April. The main topic was the principle of allocating this fund. In mid-April, the Minister of Education also solemnly mentioned it in a report to the National Assembly. It is now heard that it has begun to be distributed to various provinces and cities according to the principles discussed by experts. In order to cooperate with the needs of constitutional governance and meet the goals pursued by UNESCO, this is an extremely reasonable and urgent measure. We hope that the distribution of this fund will adopt the principle of focusing on key points. The authorities in various provinces and cities must carefully use the special funds allocated this time to maximize their effectiveness. Strictly speaking, this matter only indicates the government's intention to promote demonstration. In fact, the increased fundraising for national education funds depends more on the county-level finance to bear the burden and the cooperation of social forces. In this time of unrest and national treasury difficulties, if the government cannot afford education funds to the ratio stipulated in the constitution, we believe that we can only encourage social and private donations more. The authorities in various provinces, cities, and counties must pay close attention to the economic hardship of education, and in addition to making good use of the basic education subsidies this time, they should also refer to the "National Education Funding Reorganization and Fundraising Measures" to raise as much funds as possible to expand basic education and consolidate the foundation of our constitutional government.

Secondary education is a link between the past and the future. Now, public and private secondary schools are equally struggling financially, and secondary education after the restoration, whether in terms of equipment, teachers, or especially student level, is generally far inferior to before the War of Resistance. We should sympathize with secondary school teachers and appeal on their behalf to reduce the burden of teaching and increase salaries and benefits—this is precisely the major premise for laying a good foundation for students above the specialized level. As for from a social point of view, an even more urgent matter is the importance of vocational education at the secondary level.

According to the Ministry of Education's statistics for the 35th academic year, among the 5,892 secondary schools nationwide, only 724 were vocational schools, accounting for only about 12% of the total, which is a really too small proportion. Considering the difficulties of our national economy, it is even more important to consider the future of young people in general. Rather than graduating from ordinary secondary school without being able to go on to further studies and having no expertise in finding a job, it is better to consider career goals before entering school and prepare for professional training. Moreover, the construction projects of various departments of the country are in need of mid-level cadres trained by secondary vocational schools. The Ministry of Education and various provincial and county bureaus should support and add vocational schools and increase the number of vocational classes in the future; and young people in general and their parents should also change their concepts, face reality, and, except for those who are determined and able to go on to further studies, should actively enter vocational schools. We believe and earnestly hope that UNESCO member states can give us valuable guidance and assistance in this regard.

Speaking of current higher education, we can simply say: the state finances (that is, the people's taxes) bear the greatest burden for education in this department, but unfortunately, the situation shown by some universities is the most turbulent and excessive! The most obvious form of this turmoil—student strikes—of course greatly damages the student level and the reputation of the academy. All mindful university professors and university students, how do they think their image given to compatriots (that is, people who indirectly bear the cost of universities) by these events, and how does their representation of our country's education give international people a perception, it should have reached the point of unbearable words and unbearable thoughts! In the difficult restoration of higher education over the past year, the most common report we have seen in the newspaper is destructive strikes. We will never ignore the youthful era of depression, the difficult life of professors, we also heard the various reasons advocated by young students; we believe that rational guidance and solutions should be added, but we really wonder: why can strikes be held by a few people and tolerated by the majority of university teachers and students? Since the student unrest in Peking University and Peiping Normal College in April, the Central University, Jinling, Chung Cheng University, Hunan University, Sun Yat-sen University of Science and Engineering, Sichuan University, and Yingshi University have had strikes in mid-May, and some have not yet resumed classes today. When Mr. Aubry inspects the universities in Peking and Shanghai, he will definitely discover that there is only too much "freedom" in the academy, too free speech, and will doubt what some propaganda calls "controlling" youth and "persecuting" youth is all about. Many emotionally impulsive and pure students still mostly do not believe that the government or public opinion points out that the Communist bandits are instigating student unrest. We will not analyze it for the time being; we only represent the fair public opinion and reiterate: strikes "only destroy the students' own studies, despise and deny the spiritual life of professors, and at the same time stifle the effectiveness of the entire education!" Therefore, we would like to sincerely appeal separately: (1) the majority of university students should have "intellectual self-awareness." Your dissatisfaction with reality and blame begin with waiting and watching, and end with being controlled by violence. Only when the majority of people exert their courage to express their true opinions can the minority be afraid of causing trouble and acting recklessly, and can maintain their studies and reputation, otherwise they will lose all social sympathy. Secondly, (2) university professors must re-use their "scientific brains" and stand up and unite to express their opinions in order to maintain the freedom of lecturing and the dignity of the academy. Because the current student unrest created by certain cores is by no means a dispute between the government and the "people," let alone a party dispute, but a corner gate between science and anti-science, education and destruction! In addition, we hope (3) that the education administrative authorities and the security authorities must be responsible and more cautious during this time. The education authorities must pay attention to eliminating and guiding more than preventing after the event, inducing pure students to be self-aware more than punishing students; and the security authorities must understand the psychology of young people, should not habitually use official jargon, let alone deal with it hastily, and should try to avoid stimulating the emotions of the majority of pure students in preventing and stopping disturbances. Today, the country is in great difficulty, and the "persecuted" higher education is facing a crisis. How to turn danger into safety and cultivate the progress of science is mainly the responsibility of the "rational" majority of professors and students.

### Yang Mei Fever Reaches its Climax, Second Stage Test Awaits Mutual Consultation, Elementary School Students Write Eagerly to Director Li, Hoping He Can Answer the Reason for Not Eating

[Our newspaper Chongqing, May 31st electric] The "Yang Mei fever" among the people of Chongqing has reached its climax today. Yang Mei and Li Zhiyu, at the invitation of our newspaper, attracted even more public interest when taking photos at the Health Bureau. British female reporter Diphneinosley and Associated Press reporter Madsen had a secret talk with Yang Mei's guardian Zhuo Songdai separately today, hoping to take over the next step of research on Yang Mei. Dr. Jiang Zhuohua, the director of the Municipal Hospital, once urged Zhuo in front of our newspaper reporter to refuse euphemistically. How this matter develops depends on whether the next step decision of the Health Bureau can be accepted by Zhuo. Director Jiang and Director Hu Xianwen both urged Zhuo to postpone the return of Yang Mei to Jiulongpo. Zhuo insisted on signing a contract. Therefore, after Zhu Shaoliang summoned Yang Mei at 2 pm, he immediately took the Health Bureau ambulance and left the hospital with Yang Mei. However, the Health Bureau still sent two nurses, Liao Junming, etc. to accompany her and continue to inspect. More than 20 photos of Yang Mei with Zhu Shaoliang, Li Zhiyu, etc., and life photos will be published in our newspaper within days. In addition, the miracle of Yang Mei's not eating has caused a serious reaction from readers due to the continuous publication in our newspaper in recent days. Li Zhiyu received a letter from Feng Baocai, a 14-year-old elementary school student from Zhangjiazhai, Zhongzheng West Road, Shanghai, on the 24th. A special excerpt is as follows: "My father is a worker in the factory. His monthly salary is very small. In addition to my mother, there are two younger brothers, one older sister, and one younger sister at home. There are six people eating at home, and only my father produces. I see my father working hard all day and returning home from the factory dejectedly. My heart is very sad. I hope you can tell me the results of Yang Mei's research and what she ate that she doesn't need to eat food. If a person doesn't need to eat food and can still do things as usual, isn't it possible to reduce my father's heavy burden? In this way, my younger brothers and sisters may be able to study for a few more years, because I am very worried that we will be called to drop out of school at any time. If you tell me the reason for not eating, not only my brothers and sisters will be grateful to you, but all the elementary school students in Shanghai or the whole country will be equally grateful to you, at least the children of poor fathers like us will have this feeling.

### Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Project More Than Half Completed

[Our newspaper Chengdu, May 27th News] The southwest artery, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, has been actively repaired since it resumed work in May of the 35th year. Before the War of Resistance, most of the bridges, culverts, and tunnels in the Chengdu-Neijiang (Jiang) section of the railway had been completed, and the roadbed stone and earthwork had been completed by more than 5 million cubic meters. From January to May of this year, 60% of the entire project in the Chongqing-Neijiang section was completed, and it can be completed this year. 40% of the entire project in the Chengdu-Neijiang section has been completed, and it can be completed next year. As for the budget for the first half of this year, it is listed as 300 billion yuan according to the January number, which is seriously insufficient.

### French Loan to Build Chengdu Trolleybus

[Our newspaper Chengdu, May 27th News] The Chengdu Municipal Government decided to build the Chengdu trolleybus in order to build a large Chengdu. Recently, it was introduced by Jia Shanna, the representative of the French Economic Delegation, and assisted by the famous French Jia Ke Meng Tram Manufacturing Company in the design. The planned total budget is 1,363,000 US dollars, including power plants (including seven generators), car factories, lines (12 kilometers long and four lines), vehicles (20 trolleybuses) and other equipment. According to Jia Shanna's talk to reporters: this budget only needs 743,500 US dollars when converted according to the new exchange rate of the French franc. The French banking group is willing to lend 90% of the entire cost, and Chengdu will raise 10% by itself. The municipal government has now invited gentry and merchants, and decided to raise funds to form a preparatory office for the Chengdu Tram Company, actively work, and issue municipal construction savings bonds to raise capital. After the short-term fundraising is completed, it will formally sign a contract with the French banking group.

### Sichuan Citizen Luo Hongzhang Invented Power Machine

[Our newspaper Chengdu, May 27th News] Luo Hongzhang from Santai, Sichuan, recently invented a kind of labor-saving power machine in Chengdu. It uses the vibration force of the pendulum and the principles of "flywheel", "centrifugal force" and lever wheel axle, and is made of domestic iron and wood. It can be used as the original power for oil pressing, sugarcane pressing, and all important industries. This machine only needs one person to shake it, without the need for an internal combustion engine or electric motor to shake it. The cost is very low, and the efficiency is more than ten times higher than that of manpower. It has now applied to the government for a patent.

### Improved Foreign Exchange Management Receives Good Response from All Parties

[Our newspaper Tianjin, May 31st electric] After the announcement of the foreign exchange settlement certificate method, the Tianjin trade community responded flatly. Authoritative sources pointed out that the current trade system will have to be completely reformed to meet this method. The import quarterly approval method cannot continue to be implemented. All parties believe that the new method will have a significant effect on absorbing overseas Chinese remittances.

[Central News Agency This City News] After the government formally announced the improvement of foreign exchange management and adopted the foreign exchange settlement certificate method on the 30th, all parties responded extremely well. The Central News Agency reporter specially interviewed leaders from all walks of life to learn about the repercussions of this new measure. The details are as follows:

Zhang Yujiu, executive director of the China Import and Export Trade Association, said: Under the new method, the import exchange rate is increased, which can protect the domestic agricultural, industrial, and mining industries to a considerable extent, and can avoid the phenomenon of excessive profits from imported goods. However, to promote exports, it is necessary to immediately supplement various nationwide loan methods under the new method, such as collateral loans, exchange loans, packing, etc., to be effective. Furthermore, the settlement certificate should be issued at the same time as the settlement, and it should not wait until the time of shipment to issue it.

Yan Jingzhong, general manager of the China Silk Company, said: The cost of raw silk has always been very different from foreign prices. However, after the announcement of the new method, if silk goods are sold, it will be in a superior profit state, and the profit is about 20% to 30%. Furthermore, if silk underwear is transported overseas, the profit will be higher. Our country's silk weaving industry should take this opportunity to quickly catch up and strive to improve quality to meet international market standards.

Anecdotes of the Ancient and Modern Are Copyrighted

Song Binglun, executive director of the Shanghai Import and Export Trade Association, said: Regarding the central bank's adoption of the settlement certificate method this time, I believe that it is a wise measure. It has two characteristics: (1) The new method enables exporters to sell the foreign exchange obtained from exports to designated banks at the listed price, and the difference between the insufficient amount can be transferred to compensation when selling the certificate. If this is the case, export trade will greatly increase. (2) Overseas Chinese remittances are expected to increase. In the future, overseas Chinese remittances will no longer have to escape in the black market, and they can gradually be brought into the right track.

Tang Jisan, chairman of the Shanghai Tea Export Trade Association, said: Promoting exports and earning foreign exchange is what the government has always valued. The issuance of the settlement certificate this time is the most thorough and fully demonstrates the government's hope for export business. We should be aware of this and strive to promote it.

[Central News Agency Hong Kong, 30th electric] The Central Bank's representative in Hong Kong said today: The foreign exchange control regulations announced by the Central Bank yesterday are actually a limited free trade system. This regulation has aroused great interest in the commercial and financial circles here. He believes that the abolition of the foreign exchange regulations controlling imports will encourage large-scale imports and overseas Chinese remittances. The new policy will also simplify my country's import and export trade, and will also have some impact on preventing smuggling. He said that he has not yet reached a decision on the rumors that the purchase and sale of my country's legal currency is prohibited in Hong Kong.

### Anti-Japanese General Wang Delin: Descendants Stranded in Shenyang City. His Wife Speaks of the Past in Tears

[Airmail report from our newspaper, Shenyang, May 26] The September 18th Incident of 1931 sparked an upsurge of anti-Japanese sentiment in the area between Changbai Mountain and Heilongjiang. The Japanese invaders, plotting to occupy "Southern Manchuria," were about to advance into "Northern Manchuria," eager to open up the passage from Korea to Northeast China, and actively planned to build the Jilin-Huining Railway. When their surveying team reached Fengsheng Zhezi in the middle section of the Jilin-Huining Road, they were completely wiped out by Wang Delin, the battalion commander of a border defense force. The Japanese invaders launched an attack with land and air forces, holding out for three months. That was the story of November 5, 1931. The name of the patriotic hero Wang Delin became known throughout the country. That was indeed an extraordinary story.

Wang Delin's Wife

Crown of Honor Lies Buried Underground. In March 1933, after a heroic struggle, anti-Japanese heroes such as Wang Delin, Ma Zhanshan, and Li Du had to lead their troops into the Soviet Union and return to China via a roundabout route. General Wang Delin, harboring the ambition to recover his homeland, went into exile within the customs. In the winter of 1935, he went to Rehe, hoping to get assistance from General Fu Zuoyi to reorganize the anti-Japanese forces in the Northeast, but his wish was not fulfilled. Unfortunately, he died of illness in solitude in the spring of 1937 in a military camp in Yishui, Southern Shandong. At that time, he was the commander-in-chief of the Restoration Army. Yishui was his hometown, and he had organized guerrilla forces behind enemy lines.

The old general rests peacefully underground with his crown of honor, but his family, consisting of his 52-year-old wife and a young daughter, lives a bleak life in a remote corner of the Northwest. If it were not for their unfortunate circumstances, they might have remained unknown for life.

Ran a Mill to Provide Education for Her Daughter. By chance, this reporter met Wang Delin's wife, who had been stranded in the Northeast for two years, yesterday. She tearfully recalled the past. Her painful life experiences made her so sad, but she would always be satisfied with General Wang's patriotism and honor. Wang's wife said:

"We met at Zhengzhou Railway Station in the 26th year (of the Republic, i.e., 1937). He said, 'You go to Xi'an, I'm going to do my thing.' After that, we never met again. When he was at the front, he often wrote in his letters that his money was enough, without asking if we had any money. I knew he was very poor..."

General Wang's death was a deep blow to Wang's wife. After shedding her tears, she had to continue living and raise her child. She opened a mill herself, grinding flour for people, and sent her child to school. Life was hard enough; she didn't even have money to cut her child's hair. At that time, some old friends of General Wang occasionally gave them sympathy and assistance.

After the victory, the Northeast was restored. Wang's wife thought that she still had a few acres of thin fields in her second hometown (Jilin, Yanji) to live on for the rest of her life, so she resolutely took her daughter, Miss Jianhong, on a refugee ship from the "Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" to the Northeast. As soon as she set foot on the land of the Northeast, she realized that she had had a beautiful dream. She could not return to her hometown, and she had no relatives to turn to, so the mother and daughter had to work in the refugee factory of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Northeast Branch, and later had to rely on the refugee camp in Tiexi. Kong Xianrong, the National Assembly representative who committed suicide in Nanjing, was a comrade who raised the flag of righteousness with General Wang Delin, like brothers. Although General Kong was unable to provide for their livelihood during his lifetime, they still received a lot of spiritual comfort. After General Kong's death, their lives became even more desolate.

Unable to Bear to Drown Her Child. Wang's wife said sadly, "I set my sights on a pool of water under the bridge in Tiexi District, but this child, Chuanghong, always stayed by my side. If I jumped, what would happen if she followed me? She is still young! She should still have her future."

A few days ago, the mother and daughter wrote to Madame Chiang, hoping that she could have pity on their plight. Wang's wife said that she would be endlessly grateful if the government could provide relief to maintain their minimum living standards. She has high expectations for her daughter's future and hopes that her daughter will be allowed to study at the school for the descendants of anti-Japanese soldiers. This lady lost her opportunity to study early and has to do some small things in the cooperative of a certain agency, which is still not enough to maintain her life. Her mother carried her from the Japanese artillery fire when she was very young and later opened a mill to provide for her education. These deep impressions often make her shed tears of gratitude.

Social figures here are very concerned about the descendants of General Wang Delin. Madame Han Quan-hua, the wife of Wei Lihuang, has inquired about their lives and has reportedly expressed her intention to send them to Nanjing.

The Life of Kong Xianrong's Descendants. The future lives of Kong Xianrong's wife and young son are also a cause for great anxiety. Recently, the mother and son came to Shenyang from Changchun. The plane tickets were all donated by various sectors of Changchun. Kong's wife said, "Kong Xianrong's troop continues Kong Xianrong's cause, which is a great spiritual comfort to me." Kong's old troops were recruited by his long-time comrade-in-arms, Lang Yunpeng. Lang said, "It is an insult to say that Mr. Kong committed suicide for some reason. His death was indeed due to his concern for the country and his indignation at the world. It was a form of remonstration through death. We should understand him, learn from him, and inherit his great spirit, and strive for the country and for the Northeast!"

[Central News Agency, Seoul, May 31] The first Korean National Assembly, elected on May 10 under the auspices of the United Nations and boycotted by the Soviet Union, opened at 2 pm on May 31, paving the way for Korean independence and unification. Two hundred representatives from the 157 electoral districts of South Korea, representing two-thirds of the Korean population, will meet to carry out the following three tasks: (1) to formulate a constitution on which the Korean government will be established and the president will be elected; (2) to seek ways to unify South Korea under US military occupation and North Korea under Soviet military occupation; and (3) to solve the difficult economic problems of the people. There are also 100 vacant seats reserved for representatives from communist North Korea, but they are not expected to participate. The Soviet Union has refused to allow the United Nations Commission on Korea to enter North Korea to oversee nationwide elections. The temporary chairman of this National Assembly will be Dr. Syngman Rhee, the 74-year-old leader of the Korean Independence Promotion Party. 85 of the members are non-partisan, 54 belong to the Korean Independence Promotion Party, 30 belong to the Korean Democratic Party, whose chairman is the pro-Japanese Kim Seong-soo, and 11 belong to the United Youth Party. Many of them are so-called independent figures who have ties to the Korean Democratic Party.

[Associated Press, Seoul, May 31] The Korean Assembly, which was created as a result of the United Nations-sponsored election on May 10, held its first meeting on the 31st. The 73-year-old anti-communist political leader Syngman Rhee was elected speaker and immediately declared with pleasure, "The Republic of Korea is reborn." Rhee's election process only took 90 minutes. He then made an acceptance speech stating that the government that the Assembly is about to create will have sovereignty over all of Korea, including North Korea, which is currently occupied by the Soviet Union. Rhee then listed his policy agenda: First, US troops should continue to remain stationed until the Koreans are able to defend themselves by forming an army. Even after the withdrawal of US troops, American technical personnel should remain as advisors, especially in the economic field. Rhee said: The Korean government will attempt to "conduct friendly negotiations directly with the Soviet Union to fairly resolve public issues between the two countries." He gave the Korean communists "one last chance to repent and return. If so, we will forget the past and not hold them accountable." Otherwise, the Korean communists will "be subject to severe legal sanctions, and no foreign power will be able to assist them." (This was clearly addressed to the United Nations Commission on Korea, which had pressured both the US and South Korea to release 3,800 political prisoners.) Syngman Rhee promised to eradicate corruption, eliminate speculation among government officials, accelerate the organization of a national defense army, control prices, and legislate to protect freedom of publication, speech, and assembly. He also said: "Although the US military will remain stationed for some time due to the international situation, once the Korean government formally requests its withdrawal, the US military will return home immediately. We should understand this point, that the presence of the victorious army will not interfere with our sovereignty." Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US military in South Korea, and Major General Dean, the military governor, both replied that the United States would never force the Assembly and was willing to assist in all aspects if invited. The transition of power will gradually unfold. According to the current plan, the US military does not intend to withdraw. The United Nations Commission has always been disregarded here because its representatives mostly drafted reports in Shanghai, so only assistant representatives from China and France were sent to attend, which greatly dissatisfied the Koreans. The prestige of the Commission has been dealt another blow. Only half an hour after the Assembly meeting began, police arrested 21 people from six groups who were distributing leaflets and waving flags against the Assembly.

### Byrnes Advocates Negotiations with the Soviet Union on All Issues Between the US and the Soviet Union. Condemns Stalin's Erroneous Diplomatic Strategies.

[Reuters, New York, May 30] Former Secretary of State Byrnes said today in a speech at the graduation ceremony of Winthrop College in Rock Hill, South Carolina, that the United States should be willing to discuss all issues with the Soviet Union that do not involve the governments of other allied nations. At the same time, the United States should continue its plan to strengthen its national defense. He believes that the United States should not forget the words of the ancient Indian chief, "Deceive me once, shame on you; deceive me twice, shame on me."

Byrnes apparently attaches more importance to the Soviet Union's recent peace offensive than Marshall. He said, "I have always believed that the Soviet Union will continue to expand its expansionist policy to the limits allowed by democratic countries. When the Soviet Union recognizes that it cannot continue to move forward without war, I believe it will abandon its war of nerves and seek a solution. The Soviet Union today has recognized that we do not have nerves that cannot be frightened; on the contrary, we have the strength and are prepared to use this strength to defend our freedom and, through the United Nations, to defend the freedom of other free nations with the courage to resist aggression." Byrnes also condemned Premier Stalin for publicly answering Wallace, the leader of the US Third Party, instead of directly addressing the President of the United States. Byrnes also said that the most important thing is not the subject of wealth, but whether he expresses sincerity in his willingness to resolve differences. The US government should be prepared at any time to discuss issues related to the governments of the two countries with the Soviet government, and the United Nations should be used as a tool to preside over negotiations on issues related to the governments of other allied nations.

### Soviet Newspapers Attack the US

[Reuters, Moscow, May 31] The long-silent Soviet official newspapers have begun to launch fierce attacks on the United States again. "Pravda" said that since Marshal Stalin suggested discussing the issues between the US and the Soviet Union, the attempt of the United States to conceal its aggressive policy with hypocritical words has completely failed. Since Marshal Stalin's reply to Wallace's open letter was published, the embarrassment of the US ruling class has become more and more obvious. Honest people all over the world not only regard Stalin's reply as proof of the Soviet Union's consistent peace policy, but also feel that it is a concrete plan put forward to consolidate world peace.

### What is the Purpose of the Soviet Union's Expansion of Military Strength?

[Associated Press, Temple, Texas, May 31] Secretary of the Army Royal declared here tonight that the Soviet Union is now spending almost three times as much on military spending as the United States, so how can it be said that it has no aggressive intentions? The Soviet Union has 175 combat divisions, plus about 100 auxiliary divisions and police, which are not included. The Soviet Union has no enemies in Europe and Asia, so why does it need this military strength? It is really difficult to understand.

### Wallace Runs for President with the Support of the American Communist Party

[Reuters, New York, May 30] The American Communist Party recently passed a resolution expressing its delight at the growing movement to support Wallace's presidential campaign. The Communist Party believes that there is indeed a need to establish such a third party in the United States. Although the Communist Party will put forward an independent plan in the election, and may even run for Congress and government positions, it will also give the greatest support to the progressive candidates of the People's United Movement.

### Soviet Scientists in Atomic Materials Receive Stalin Prizes

[Associated Press, Moscow, May 31] The Soviet government today awarded 39 Stalin Prizes to basic science researchers. The prizes range from 100,000 to 200,000 rubles (US$20,000 to US$40,000), completely tax-free. Armenian Armenians Arlehano and Arlehyang were awarded the prize for their discovery of new atomic particles while studying cosmic rays. Vosnishengsky, chairman of the State Planning Commission, won the prize for his book "The Soviet Union's War Economy During the Great War."

### Truman Prepares to Leave Beijing for a Tour Speech

### So Many People Die Unexpectedly During the American Weekend Holiday

[Report from our newspaper] New York, May 31 Broadcast: Memorial Day, the United States is on national holiday, and there is a crazy weekend of fun. As a result, 281 people have died since Friday, including 147 people who died on the road, 38 people who drowned, and 96 people who died in plane crashes.

[Reuters, New York, May 30] Police believe that after the American bank holiday weekend ends on Monday, the number of accidental deaths across the country will reach 400. On Saturday alone, 100 people have died in car crashes, drownings, and other accidents. Monday is American Memorial Day, and road traffic will be doubly crowded, and there will be even more deaths.

### US State and Defense Departments Request Congressional Authorization to Send Military Missions

[Associated Press, Washington, May 30] According to sources here, the State Department and the Department of Defense have submitted their final request to Congress, asking for the authority to send US military missions to any country that needs them. This plan has been approved by the House of Representatives, and the Republican leader of the Senate plans to pass other bills before Congress adjourns on June 19, so this plan will be shelved. Sources said that Secretary of Defense Forrestal will raise this matter at a closed-door meeting of the Senate Armed Services Committee on the 1st.

### President Truman Reiterates His Belief in Working for World Peace, Delivers a Speech on Memorial Day Across the United States

[Associated Press, Washington, May 30] Today is the American Civil War Memorial Day, and churches in various places held memorial services. President Truman laid a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery and said, "In order to promote world peace, we must have the ability to promote peace. May God give us this strength. The American nation is composed of people from all over the world, and in this country, they can live in peace with each other, and this is our aspiration for the whole world. The fundamental principle of American foreign policy is to spread peace based on justice throughout the world."

### Results of the Czech Election: The National Front Wins. The Number of Blank Ballots is Unexpectedly High

[Associated Press, Prague, May 31] The high percentage of blank protest votes in the Czech general election has forced the Ministry of the Interior to dismiss the ballot counters employed by the authorities and count the ballots itself. Blank votes in Prague average about 25 percent, and in some areas, they reach as high as 50 percent.

[Reuters, Prague, May 31] After the final results of the Czechoslovak general election on Sunday were announced, it was revealed that the Communist Party-controlled National Front won 89.2 percent of all valid votes, accounting for 80.1 percent of all registered voters. The authorities did not announce the number of invalid votes and abstentions. Since there was no opposition party running, voters who opposed the National Front could only be measured by the number of blank ballots, invalid ballots, and abstentions. The most unique phenomenon of this election was the way in which blank ballots were cast. It is rumored that some voters attached photos of Churchill and the late Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk to the ballot envelopes. Other voters wrote "Tomorrow we are coming" on the ballot papers. Prague Radio announced the victory of the Communist Party, saying that this free election proves that the Czechoslovak people are willing to have the new regime continue to govern and can also prove that the crisis in February was actually beneficial to the country. The National Front can now accelerate the implementation of its revitalizing reform plan with the support of the people nationwide.

### Britain and Egypt Reach Temporary Agreement on the Sudan Issue

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, May 30] After two weeks of negotiations between the Egyptian Foreign Minister and the British Ambassador, a temporary agreement has been reached on the Sudan issue. The issue has been pending since the Egyptian government filed a complaint with the Security Council.

### Israel Triply Encircled; Iraqi Forces Only Five Miles from Jewish Capital; Now Fully Engaged in Pursuit of Jewish Troops Southward

[Central News Agency, Cairo, 31st] A report from "Al-Samani," Amman, states that Iraqi troops have reached the coastal area north of Tel Aviv, effectively splitting Israel in two.

[Reuters, London, 31st] According to reports, a communique announced that Iraqi armored units are less than five miles from the Israeli capital, Tel Aviv, and are now fully engaged in pursuing the retreating Jewish troops from the Khulm area, pressing towards the city of Tel Aviv. Earlier reports from the Arab Legion stated that its forces had reached Ludd and Ramle, twelve miles east of Tel Aviv, while Egyptian forces in the south are also rapidly advancing towards Tel Aviv along the coastal highway. In Jerusalem, Arab forces have completed new deployments, preparing for a full-scale assault on the Jewish areas of the new city.

[Reuters, London, 30th] Although only forty-eight hours remain before the deadline for accepting the recent Security Council-imposed truce order for Palestine, the Arab allied forces have accelerated their advance to complete the encirclement of the Israeli capital from three sides in time.

The Egyptian forces in the south, after advancing to the key town of Isdud, twenty-five miles south of Tel Aviv, have concentrated their forces north of the city, preparing to continue their advance. Aside from a few Israeli aircraft carrying out attacks, there have been no reports of determined ground resistance. The Arab Legion in the central sector, although still needing to deal with Jewish troops in the new city of Jerusalem and attacking Latrun, reports that its troops have advanced to Ramle and Ludd, only twelve miles from Tel Aviv. The Iraqi forces in the north, advancing from the central plains of Palestine, occupied the village of Qalqilya, now less than eight miles east of the Mediterranean coast and only fourteen miles south of Tel Aviv. It is speculated that the intention of the Arab allied forces is to encircle the Israeli capital, Tel Aviv, before the deadline of 11:30 PM on June 1st for accepting the Security Council ceasefire order, and to isolate the Jewish areas in northern Palestine and the Jewish forces in the central region.

### Security Council's Four-Week Truce Order; Both Arabs and Jews Express Dissatisfaction; Jewish Radio Announces Request for Soviet Aid

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 30th, United Press] A senior Arab official stated tonight: that he is uncertain whether the Arabs will accept the new United Nations' demand for a four-week ceasefire and a ban on arms shipments to Palestine. This senior Arab official declined to be named. It is claimed: that there are too many points in the Security Council's new demands that are unfavorable to the Arab countries. An Israeli spokesman stated: that he does not yet know whether Israel will agree to accept the demands passed by the United Nations Security Council on the evening of the 9th, despite Israel's strong opposition. The words of the Arab official are highly significant, as countries originally believed that the Arab nations would accept the new demands of the United Nations, but after the official's statement, there is now a general fear that the Arab nations may reject them. [United Press, Tel Aviv, 31st] Jewish radio announced tonight that Jewish forces have requested Soviet assistance to combat the Arab and British aggression in the Holy Land. Since the Soviet Union has recognized the State of Israel and agreed to exchange ambassadors, it should further provide assistance. The radio station did not specify what form of assistance they hope the Soviet Union will provide.

### Rumors of Arab Forces Launching Full-Scale Assault on Jerusalem; Will Use Poison Gas

Jewish Side Claims Poison Gas Supplied by British

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 30th] A Jewish spokesman claimed on the 30th that the Arab Legion is planning to use poison gas and intensive artillery fire in two lightning offensives against Jerusalem on the evening of the 30th and the 31st. The spokesman also stated that, according to reports from Arab Command, the Arab forces plan to use artillery and poison gas to capture most of Jerusalem starting at midnight on the 30th. The Jewish spokesman implied that Britain is supplying the Arab Legion with the poison gas that will be used in the attack on Jerusalem, stating that the Arab countries have no facilities to manufacture poison gas and said, "The source of the poison gas is quite obvious."

[Reuters, London, 30th] Reports indicate that the Irgun Zvai Leumi-controlled Jerusalem water pump station at Erwins, near Tekoa, north of Tel Aviv, has been captured by Jewish forces. The station is located within a camp occupied by Iraqi forces and has been surrounded by Jewish forces for some time.

### Attlee Announces Britain Actively Promoting Truce in Holy Land

Denies Rift in Anglo-American Relations

[Report from this newspaper] London, 31st Broadcast: British Prime Minister Attlee addressed the House of Commons today on the Arab-Jewish issue, denying that the issue has caused a rift in Anglo-American relations. He stated that Britain is doing everything in its power to bring an end to the fighting there. Attlee requested that the House of Commons not ask Bevin to submit a report on the Palestine issue at this time. Attlee said that the issue of a truce is currently under consideration by both the Arabs and the Jews, and that publishing a report at this time would likely affect the realization of a truce.

### Japan Switches to Sterling for Trade; Britain, Australia, and Other Countries Have Joined; Japanese Trade Delegation Arrives in Pakistan

The chairmanship of this meeting is expected to be taken by the Indian Minister of Transport and prominent economist, Mathai. The chief Chinese representative, Li Cho-min, the chief British representative, Sir Grotte, the chief U.S. representative, Grady, the chief Soviet representative, Novikov, and the chief French representative, Mr. Moss, are all expected to arrive in Ootacamund on the 31st.

### Great Flood in the United States; Columbia River Breaches Levee

Extensive Losses in Northwest Wealthy Region

[Reuters, Portland, Oregon, 31st] The city of Vanport, built during wartime with a population of 18,000, has been completely submerged due to the breaching of the Columbia River levee. Two-story wooden houses along the riverbank were knocked down by the force of the water and are scattered like matchsticks. Waterfall-like water rushed in from the breach in the levee, houses collapsed, and debris floated everywhere. The number of deaths and injuries cannot be immediately tallied.

[Reuters, New York, 30th] Floods occurred in the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and the province of British Columbia in Canada. The floods were caused by spring flooding combined with heavy rain. The wealthy agricultural and industrial areas of the Northwest suffered extensive losses. In Columbia alone, property losses are estimated to reach $30 million.

### British Industries Fair

— (Special correspondent in England, Sa Ben Geng)

(London dispatch) The 1948 British Industries Fair was held from May 3 to May 14. The first fair was held in 1915. It is an organized exhibition of the country's major products, with the aim of encouraging and promoting commerce. The first fair was held in London and 591 exhibitors participated, covering an area of 88,714 square feet. It was organized by the Overseas Trade Department of the British government. From the name of the organizing body, we can imagine that it was not only for domestic purposes, but also for foreign trade.

In 1920, the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce also organized a heavy industry exhibition, which became the mechanical section of the "British Industries Fair". From this year onwards, the fair was held annually in Birmingham and London. The former can be said to focus on machinery, metals, and ironware, and is organized by the local Chamber of Commerce, but with the support of the government. The latter focuses on light industry and is directly managed by the government, formerly by the Overseas Trade Department, now by the Export Promotion Department of the Board of Trade. This is a very important administrative unit in the British government, and the Director of the Board of Trade is a member of the Cabinet. When the Birmingham and London fairs were held simultaneously for the first time in 1920, 1,689 units participated, covering an area of 315,088 square feet. In 1939, 2,338 units participated, covering an area of 826,433 square feet.

From the past experience, this kind of fair has two characteristics. First, it is national in nature, and only products produced in Britain or any part of the British Empire can participate. Second, with the exception of textiles, only the actual producers of the goods can participate. The former is probably because this is a fair to promote national goods, and the latter is probably to facilitate trade. The reason why textiles are excluded is probably because textiles themselves include several independent manufacturing processes, and it is difficult to determine who is the actual producer.

This year's fair is still held in London and Birmingham. It is estimated that more than 3,000 units participated. If you walk around all the exhibition counters, it is equivalent to walking 25 miles. Merchants from all over the world were invited to visit in advance. According to the latest published figures, about 15,000 foreign businessmen from 108 different locations came to visit this time. The Birmingham section is open to everyone at any time, while the London section is open to the general public for only three days. Visitors must buy tickets, naturally one ticket per person per entry, but merchants can purchase a badge with an invitation or other proof, which allows them to enter and exit the venue at any time.

The content of the exhibition can be divided into two parts. The London section is divided into two locations (however, in addition to the regular transportation between the two locations, there are also special vehicles that provide free transportation). The exhibits include chemical drugs, optical and photographic equipment, sports equipment, printing machines, musical instruments, radios, stationery, children's toys, jewelry, watches, leather, woolen fabrics, clothing, furniture, and so on. Birmingham focuses on electrical machinery. Birmingham is one of the industrial centers of England, 113 miles from London.

This fair has a promotional nature. Due to the seriousness of Britain's import surplus problem, its significance is even more important. As a Chinese person, after seeing this fair, I think there is one thing that should be mentioned here, that is, we visitors saw some things in this fair that are not available in the British domestic market at all. In other words, they really tightened their belts and brought all the good things for business. (May 16, 1948)

### Punishing Overseas Fishing; Shelling and Sinking Japanese Ships Fleeing; Military Judge Interrogates Fishermen at Night; Naval Commander Recounts Discovery and Pursuit

[Report from this newspaper] A Japanese fishing boat intercepted by our navy's Zhongjian warship in the waters near Yushan (also known as Shaweishan) off the mouth of the Yangtze River on the morning of May 29th was escorted to Shanghai yesterday by the Zhongjian warship and berthed at the Gaochangmiao River. The name of the fishing boat is not "Jingxian Maru" but "Unzen Maru No. 22," weighing 99 tons, carrying 13 fishermen and over 800 boxes of fish. In addition to Unzen Maru No. 22, the Zhongjian warship also sank another Japanese fishing boat, Unzen Maru No. 21, weighing 99.81 tons, that night. Except for one crew member who jumped into the sea and is missing, the remaining twelve crew members were rescued by the Zhongjian warship's lifeboat and were also escorted to Shanghai yesterday. Therefore, a total of 25 fishermen were sent to the headquarters of the First Naval District in the afternoon yesterday, where military judge Li Youjian interrogated them overnight, and reported to the Naval Headquarters in Nanjing and the Ministry of National Defense to request instructions on how to deal with them. Because there have been frequent reports of Japanese fishing boats intruding into our territorial waters recently, and with the current evidence, it is feared that it will lead to international negotiations.

The Zhongjian warship was given by a major country, weighing 4,000 tons, and is currently used for naval training. This time, 41 students from the Qingdao Naval Academy came to Shanghai. At noon on the 28th, they received an order from the General Headquarters, instructing them to intercept the four Japanese fishing boats intruding into our territorial waters. According to Commander Lin Fu and Deputy Commander Chen Donghai's account of the events, after receiving the order, the warship continued along its original route. At 2:30 AM on the 29th, they discovered two Japanese fishing boats about one nautical mile to the right of the course, about 98 nautical miles northwest of Yushan. The boats had lights on and were hauling in their nets. The Zhongjian warship ordered the two fishing boats to come alongside, but the other party ignored the order and continued to haul in their nets, turned off their lights, and then dispersed, one heading towards the bow of the Zhongjian warship and the other heading towards the stern, fleeing in different directions. The Zhongjian warship immediately concentrated its firepower and opened fire on the first boat. Although the fishing boat was hit by several shells, it still sped towards shallow water with injuries. After chasing for about ten minutes, they gave up due to the shallow water. The other boat had also disappeared. The Zhongjian warship then continued along its route and, after three quarters of an hour, discovered another two Japanese fishing boats, Unzen Maru No. 21 and No. 22, about 90 nautical miles northwest of Yushan.

Alert and Waiting to Capture in Advance

Given the escape of the previous two boats, the Zhongjian warship turned off its lights this time and approached at medium speed. At the same time, it was on alert in advance. When it approached, the two fishing boats were still casting their nets. However, because it was night, the warship circled the two fishing boats to prevent accidents, intending to wait until dawn before sending small boats to capture them. Unexpectedly, about an hour later, the two fishing boats exchanged light signals and fled in different directions again. Since the Zhongjian warship was already on alert, it immediately opened fire upon seeing this, sinking the twenty-first fishing boat. At this point, the twenty-second fishing boat did not dare to escape anymore. The Zhongjian warship then lowered its lifeboat and rescued the Japanese crew, boarding them onto the warship. This was around 4:20 AM on the 29th.

The Zhongjian warship commander pointed out that the position where the two fleeing fishing boats were discovered was at 33 degrees north latitude and 121 degrees 50 minutes east longitude, and the position where the two intercepted fishing boats were located was at 32 degrees 52 minutes north latitude and 122 degrees east longitude, both to the right of the Zhongjian warship's route from Qingdao to Shanghai, so they were absolutely in our territorial waters.

May All Be Military Disguised

Yesterday, the reporter saw the two fishing boat captains, Nakano Kameji, Shimomura Kazunaka, and other crew members on the Zhongjian warship. They were wearing old military uniforms and may have been naval personnel before. Photos of them wearing naval uniforms were found among their belongings, and some people were wearing round commemorative badges of the July 7th Incident, inscribed with the words "Commemoration of the Japan-China Incident, 1937 Ishiguro Team". Although no weapons were found on them, our naval personnel speculated that they may have thrown them into the sea. According to the confessions of the two captains, Nakano Kameji and Shimomura Kazunaka, the two fishing boats belonged to the Kawaminami Fisheries Industry Co., Ltd. of Japan and sailed from Nagasaki on May 16th, with a total of 20 boats. They gradually sailed towards the Chinese coast because they could not find any fish in these seas. When asked if they understood that they should not intrude into Chinese territorial waters, the two admitted that they were wrong and claimed that they did not understand international law. They also claimed that they did not dare to fish in the Hokkaido fishing area of Japan because they were afraid of the Russians.

Proper Custody Shaved Heads To Prevent Escape

The names of all the arrested Japanese crew members are as follows: Unzen Maru No. 21: Shimomura Kazunaka, Nakamura Nakayasu, Iida Shigeru, Ogawa Mitsuo, Okamoto Haruo, Shindo Tetsu Suzu, Kaneshuichi, Yamashita Hiroki, Kawaguchi Tadao, Ishitani Masukichi, Katsuo, Sakurai. Unzen Maru No. 22: Nakano Kameji, Matsuo Suekichi, Oda Takashi, Kawasaki Yoshihisa, Aramoto Hiroyuki, Nakamura Fujio, Matsuo, Nakano Minoru, Nishijima Hirokazu, Okuma Hidetoshi, Kumakura Satoshi, Koguchi Azaeji, Kishimoto Yaichi. Among them, except for one person who was slightly injured when jumping into the sea and one person who was sick, the rest were well taken care of and only some hair was shaved from the center of each person's head to distinguish them and prevent them from escaping.

### Rice Ration Price This Month at $500,000 per Dou; 15% Lower Than Market Price; Ren Xianqun States It Is Not a Long-Term Solution

[Report from this newspaper] The rationing price of rice for Shanghai in June has been decided by the authorities to be $500,000 per dou per person. Mayor Wu gathered representatives from the Food Department Ye Shifu, the Executive Yuan's US Relief Committee Pan Guangjiong, the director of the People's Food Allocation Committee Ren Xianqun, etc., at the municipal government at 5 PM yesterday, to hold the fourth Shanghai Rationing Grain Price Negotiation Committee. During the discussion, it was considered that the rice price in the second half of May was not normal. After discussion, it was decided to determine the rationing price of rice in June at $500,000 per dou based on the lowest possible interpretation, and immediately exchanged opinions with the Yuan Committee in Nanjing by long-distance telephone.

Ren Xianqun, the director of the People's Food Allocation Committee, told reporters yesterday: that he seemed very satisfied with the newly determined price of rationed rice for June. He believes that from yesterday's three-person meeting, it was found that China and the United States can still sincerely cooperate. According to regulations, the rationing price should not be lower than 5% of the market price, and the new price for June is already about 15% lower than the market price.

Forcibly Suppressing Rice Prices May Affect Production

However, Director Ren believes that forcibly suppressing the price of rationed rice is not a good phenomenon, as it may affect production. Because the current rise in rice prices is less than that of other commodities, excessive suppression will inevitably reduce farmers' interest in growing rice, so it is not a permanent solution. This kind of policy is also not favored by those with foresight. Director Ren said: The US government's continued provision of rice aid to China after June is indeed the best news at present, because the supply of domestic rice will be difficult starting next month, and almost all of it will depend on US rice aid.

US Rice Aid Extended for Half a Year

It is reliably learned: that the US Relief Committee has decided internally to extend rice aid to China for half a year, ending in December this year. The US government has also allocated US$12 million in advance to purchase rice as quickly as possible in Southeast Asia, Thailand, Burma, etc., which can purchase 75,000 tons of rice, so the per capita ration of rice in Shanghai in July can still continue.

Oil Price

The rationing price of oil for this month has also been determined to be 12 taels per person for soybean oil, rapeseed oil, and sesame oil, at $93,000. Raw sesame oil is $108,000.

### Some Labor Unions Dissatisfied with May's Cost of Living Index; General Labor Union Believes Method of Calculation Should Be Reconsidered

[Report from this newspaper] After the cost of living index for May was announced yesterday, the Municipal General Labor Union continuously received calls from industrial unions such as the public utilities and cotton textile industries, expressing dissatisfaction with the May worker index, believing that the index of 337,000 times only increased by 29% compared to the previous month, while prices in this month unfolded the so-called "May inflation", and its rising index, although there are no official statistics, is far beyond the ratio of 29%, which anyone can intuitively feel. After receiving the calls, the person in charge of the Municipal General Labor Union held informal discussions on the reasons for the daily decline in the worker's cost of living index, believing that the main reason for the low worker index is that the rice item (7.5 dou), which accounts for a higher percentage in the worker index, is calculated based on the rationing price since the city implemented per capita rice distribution. Although the rice in the employee index is also calculated at the rationing price, its percentage is lighter than that in the worker index. At the same time, the employee index lists items such as silk, wool, movies, and fruits, while the worker index lacks all of them, but in fact, movies, fruits, silks, etc. are also essential to the lives of workers, so it is recognized that the method of calculating the index in the future really needs to be reconsidered.

### International Youth Celebration Vandalized Students Storm Venue Waving Banners to Promote Anti-Americanism

[Our Newspaper] An unpleasant incident occurred last Saturday during the United Nations Shanghai Office's International Week, at the International Youth Celebration held at the Shanghai American School. When the celebration was half over, and the young people from various countries in Shanghai were getting along harmoniously, a group of "uninvited guests," Chinese students, suddenly stormed into the venue carrying anti-American banners and gave speeches opposing American support for Japan. The banners depicted "Uncle Sam" using money to cultivate Japanese warlords, displaying extreme sarcasm. The venue was thrown into chaos, and the festive atmosphere was completely ruined. Gibbs, the principal of the Shanghai American School, who had clearly stated when borrowing the school premises for International Week that the celebration had no political nature, quickly turned off the lights. In the darkness, shouts and excited voices mixed together, and the lights were soon turned back on. Gibbs protested to Mr. Jiang, the organizer of International Week. Mr. Jiang, taken by surprise, expressed great astonishment and apology. However, the students continued their anti-American propaganda, and Gibbs turned off the lights again. The celebration then ended unhappily. Gibbs officially lodged a protest in writing yesterday to the person in charge of International Week.

### A Few Students at Shanghai Law College Exhibit Reactionary Cartoons Patriotic Students, Incensed, Tore Down the Cartoons Exhibition Organizer Beats Students, Several Injured

[Central News Agency] The Shanghai Law College on Jiangwan Road held a grand celebration for the inauguration of the new president, Chu Fengyi, and the 20th anniversary of the tenure of school board member Qian Xinzhier during the past two days. A small number of professional students took the opportunity to initiate a "Current Affairs Cartoon Exhibition," which was publicly unveiled in the school yesterday. The content of the cartoons was extremely insulting and defamatory to the head of state and the government. The most absurd ones included: (1) a portrait of Mao Zedong, captioned "Leader of the People's Liberation Army"; (2) a depiction of the President and Vice President walking towards Yuan Shikai's tomb, titled "Almost There"; (3) a depiction of "China's Big Emperor" (a portrait of President Chiang) kneeling and presenting "New Twenty-One Demands" to an American, titled "Another Yuan Shikai." In addition, there were several wall posters titled "Heaven and Earth," the contents of which were all used to disparage the government and damage Sino-American relations. The majority of patriotic students in the school, recognizing that these reactionary propaganda materials were obviously created by communist elements, were filled with outrage and could no longer tolerate it. Several students angrily tore down the aforementioned reactionary cartoons at around 3:00 PM yesterday. The professional students who were in charge of the cartoon exhibition tried to stop them and tore up a portrait of "Mao Zedong" to destroy the evidence. The two sides initially argued, then started fighting each other. The fight escalated from inside the school to outside, lasting for a long time. During the fight, several students sustained minor injuries, and another student, Ru Zhefu, suffered a concussion and abrasions on his waist after jumping from a third-floor window. After persuasion from a majority of students, the conflict ended. The college president, Chu Fengyi, and the dean of students, Zhu Zhouchun, rushed to the school upon hearing the news to handle the situation. The injured students were taken to the Municipal Fourth Hospital for treatment in police vehicles. Those with minor injuries were bandaged by the doctors and then discharged. The situation inside the college has returned to normal.

During the conflict, the students reported the incident to the North Sichuan Road Police Station by telephone. Upon receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched a police car to maintain order. While passing near the side entrance of Zhongzheng Park, they encountered a group of students holding students Yao Jinghan, Liu Jiannong, and Cai Jincheng? together with the torn reactionary cartoons, and handed them over to the police, accusing them of being the organizers of the reactionary cartoon exhibition and the assailants. The police took them to the station for questioning. After separate interrogations, the person in charge of the branch bureau hastily prepared a report overnight and forwarded the collected reactionary cartoons, publications, and interrogation records of the students taken into custody to the general bureau, which transferred them to the Special Court for investigation and prosecution according to law.

Harmonious and approachable, many seek advice

Archbishop Spellman was born in Whitman, Massachusetts. His family was poor when he was young, and he worked and studied. He graduated from the North American College in Rome in 1921 with a doctorate in theology. In 1925, he was assigned to work in the Vatican State Secretariat and became close friends with Pope Pius XII. The gold cross he wears on his chest was a gift from the Pope, who took it off his own neck and gave it to him. In 1939, Pius XII ascended to the papacy and appointed him Archbishop of New York. In 1946, he was promoted to Cardinal. Archbishop Spellman was very close to the late American President Roosevelt. The President often sought the opinion of Archbishop Spellman on various issues, but Archbishop Spellman tried to avoid getting involved in politics.

The Archbishop is adventurous and has visited war zones several times. In ten years, he has traveled six times the circumference of the equator, totaling 141,000 miles. The Archbishop is open-minded, kind, and approachable. His residence on 50th Street in Massachusetts is always crowded, and people constantly seek his advice.

### Checks Cannot Be Used on the Same Day Only Silverware Industry Implements Restrictions But Those Duly Accepted or Verified Checks Are Not Restricted

[Our Newspaper] The case of bank customers depositing checks from other banks, which cannot be used until they have been collected, has been decided to be implemented on the 1st. The person in charge of the Shanghai Financial Control Bureau recently further explained as follows: This case was already circulated by the Ministry of Finance for implementation last summer. This measure is actually based on the fact that some customers prematurely issued checks before they had the money, which not only inflated credit and increased the speed of circulation but also increased the number of returned checks, causing anxiety in the financial market. Therefore, it was necessary to impose some restrictions. However, the practice of using checks as collateral has been a long-standing tradition, and it would be difficult to avoid inconvenience if it were suddenly canceled. Therefore, in order to take into account the facts, the implementation period was repeatedly extended at the request of the silverware industry and the business community, and compromise measures were formulated. Recently, various sectors have expressed concern about this, so a few points are further explained:

1. The restriction that checks cannot be used on the same day only refers to checks. Other bank drafts, certified checks, and legal bills of exchange are not subject to this restriction.

2. Even with checks, not all checks cannot be used on the same day. Those that have been duly accepted or verified are still allowed to be used at any time. Therefore, the issue lies in whether it has been "collected" or not, and not whether it is "the same day".

3. Recently, representatives from the China Industrial Association and the Industrial Trade Association came to the bureau to request that the restrictions on the use of checks be relaxed appropriately. The bureau agreed that for checks issued with the consent of the silverware bank or firm and a collateral contract has been established, the checks may still be used within the agreed valid term limit.

4. It is expected that the number of returned checks may increase in the first two days of the implementation of the measure of not using checks as collateral, but this is a temporary phenomenon and will decrease afterward. The bureau has also paid close attention to prevention and hopes that the business community will be especially careful with the checks they issue. It is best to have them certified by the bank or firm in advance or negotiate properly before issuing them to avoid returned checks.

### Market Sentiment is Timid Chinese Stocks Decline Short-Term Treasury Bill Trading Mediocre

Yesterday, Chinese stocks declined as the environment was unfavorable. Hot stocks declined sharply, while miscellaneous stocks were still flat. Due to export materials, China Silk was the only one to show profits, with a stalemate at closing.

In the early morning, market sentiment was already weak due to various adverse effects. Wing Spinning opened low at 2,650 yuan. After opening, there were no transactions and it sold to the 2,600 yuan mark. With the support of No. 69 and others, it rebounded to 2,675 yuan, but market sentiment was already lost and it struggled at the 2,600 yuan mark.

Compared to the morning closing, Sino-French, Jingfu, New Light, Matches, China Silk, and Xinhua rose by half, Tongyi Underwear was flat, and the rest rose slightly. The fortunes of various stocks outside the market varied.

Treasury Bills Short-term treasury bills were auctioned yesterday in two types, A and B. Banks helped sell them, but profits were limited and interest was low. Retail investors bought slightly. Type A retreated from 74.5 yuan to 72.5 yuan, closing at 72.8 yuan. Type B retreated from 76 yuan to 73.5 yuan.

### Dodd and the Yarn Control Committee Discuss Cotton Allocation Issues

American textile expert Mr. Dodd has decided to be stationed at the Yarn Control Committee office to assist in the utilization of US aid cotton. It is learned that Mr. Dodd arrived at the committee yesterday and discussed cotton allocation issues with various responsible departments.

In addition, the Yarn Control Committee recently issued a statement from its person in charge regarding recent external criticisms of the committee's cotton sales, stating that the sale of cotton is to cooperate with the Central Bank's tightening of credit. Because tightening credit is a comprehensive policy, if other materials are sold off without cotton, the price of cotton will inevitably rise. The Yarn Control Committee's action was taken after consultation with the Central Bank. Moreover, the sale price is lower than the market price, which proves that there is little profit involved. As for the alleged suspension of sales, it is also incorrect. The Central Bank has recently consulted and decided to sell another six or seven thousand dan (a unit of weight) or so, and will stop selling after this amount is sold.

### Tightening of Interbank Positions, Sluggish Rice Trading, People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee Continues to Sell Rice Yesterday

The People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee continued to sell rice in the rice market, selling a total of six thousand shi (a unit of volume) in the North and Second Municipalities, with the price unchanged at 5.6 million. Due to the inability to use bills of exchange outside the market, most transactions specified next-day bank drafts, causing peers to feel the squeeze on their positions, so transactions were very rare. White japonica rice, thin indica rice, initially opened at 6.8 million, but the market weakened by 50,000 due to a lack of buyers. Early rice and "Yangxian" rice prices remained unchanged, while white yuan rice retreated to 7.8 million. Yesterday's arrivals were even scarcer due to the rain, totaling 2,337 shi in the North and Second Municipalities.

Flour: The market opened early due to patronage from outside customers and the rebound in inland prices, resulting in active sales and positive sentiment, which pushed prices up. Old car flour opened at 2.13 million, and warship flour opened at 2.11 million. Later in the market, due to limited appetite from outside customers and continued supply, and poor absorption by local businesses, old car flour retreated to 2.1 million, and warship flour closed at 2.08 million, with both seeing hedging.

### Downstream Summer Woolen Fabrics

Summer woolen fabrics have continued to trend downwards recently. Although retail prices at shops have not been significantly reduced, wholesale market prices at tea parties have all weakened. The reason is that most of the sales to Japan have passed, and actual sales are gradually decreasing. With abundant goods in the market, prices are difficult to rise. Yesterday, local factory pile cloth sold for an average of 4 million to 5.5 million yuan per yard, while "Fanliding" cloth sold for 4.67 million to 6.5 million yuan.

### Tung Oil Purchase Temporarily Suspended

The China Trust Bureau's purchase of tung oil for export on behalf of the government has been interrupted since its inception due to the constant fluctuations in the black market foreign exchange rate. At yesterday's regular meeting of the Export Goods Appraisal Committee, it was noted that the government has promulgated new measures for export foreign exchange settlement, and exporters can export freely under the new measures. Therefore, the purchase of tung oil is no longer necessary. Therefore, it was decided to temporarily suspend the purchase work starting this week.

### Silkworm Cocoon Loan Approved for 63 Companies

[Our Newspaper Wuxi, 31st] The cocoon loan will be fully transferred to Wuxi before the opening of the market on the 3rd. The number of approved manufacturers in this county is 63.

Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions were affected by the inability to use bills of exchange on the same day, making sentiment even more apprehensive. Interbank credit tightened, and the sudden suspension of sales by the Spinning and Construction Company, coupled with sparse purchases by out-of-town buyers due to rain, caused long positions to unwind one after another.

42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell immediately at the opening, and although there was some price support midway, the final price was 300 million yuan due to excessive supply and limited demand, a decrease of 16 million yuan compared to last Saturday. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell by 8 million to 16.7 million.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market conditions were characterized by the imminent strict implementation of the bill of exchange restriction measures, resulting in stagnant circulating capital and tighter credit in the market. There were very few entrants into the market. Except for some additional purchases by local businesses, businesses from North Gang, Shanxi Gang, and Hankou Gang all sold, and transactions were not smooth.

12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth fell by 90,000 yuan at the morning opening. Subsequently, the new foreign exchange settlement measures improved sentiment and briefly rebounded by about 60,000 to 70,000. However, due to the tightening of positions and continuous sales by cargo owners, and the news of declining yarn prices, the closing price was 6.9 million yuan, down 190,000 yuan from last weekend. Other cloths also saw declines of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan, but the Shilin cloth market remained stable. After the close, Dragon Head fine cloth fell further to 6.85 million yuan, with few buyers.

In addition: Regarding the cotton yarn market the day before yesterday, due to the fact that bills of exchange cannot be used on the same day starting today, a special notice was issued to change the delivery procedures. In the past, the market's transactions were based on the principle of delivering goods with checks and settling on the same day. Now it is specifically stipulated that starting from June 1, all transactions in the market must be delivered with interbank drafts and settled clearly on the same day.

### The Stabilization Fund Committee Holds an Emergency Meeting, the Focus of Work Will Change

Since Governor of the Central Bank Yu Hongjun announced the new measures for import and export foreign exchange settlement the day before yesterday, the Foreign Exchange Fund Stabilization Committee held an emergency meeting yesterday morning. Chairman Chen Guangfu, committee members Liu Gongquan, Shen Xirui, and others attended, and Import Management Committee Chairman Huo Baoshu also attended. They discussed how to coordinate future foreign exchange stabilization work with the new settlement measures. In the future, the focus of foreign exchange stabilization work will shift from adjusting exchange rates in the past to balancing the income and expenditure of foreign exchange positions. The authorities believe that if the income and expenditure of foreign exchange positions can be balanced, it will be of great benefit to the implementation of the new policy. It is also heard that there will be changes in the export management policy. The new policy may be to relax the current control standards slightly. It is generally estimated that this relaxation may be difficult to implement in the short term. The authorities still need to conduct appropriate reviews of the effectiveness of the new policy over a certain period of time before they can make a decision. When Import Management Committee Chairman Huo Baoshu answered reporters' questions about the commutation policy yesterday, he only said that the Import Management Committee does not intend to change the quota announced for the fifth and sixth seasons. However, news from another reliable source said that the Import Management Committee is indeed drafting a plan to change the current control policy.

There are X-rays and laboratory reports to prove that the diagnosis is accurate. The patient's general health was very poor.

### Shanghai University Games: Competitions in Four Divisions

The Track and Field Committee of Universities and Colleges in this city held its second committee meeting at the Baxianqiao YMCA at 12:00 noon the day before yesterday to discuss matters related to the University Games. Representatives from Hujiang (Bao Heqing), Municipal Sports College (Wu Bangwei), Dongya (Dong Chengliang and Hu Xidi), Tongji (Shi Zhizhi), Fudan (Shen Kunnan), and other schools attended. Wu Bangwei of the Municipal Sports College, the chairman, first reported that nine universities, four colleges, four vocational schools, and one sports college, a total of 18 schools, had registered for the University Games. In addition, the National Defense Medical College has been asked to be responsible for the emergency medical work of the games. After discussion, many resolutions were passed: (1) The nine universities will be a group, divided into men's and women's divisions (Ordnance School, Guanghua, Tongji, Datong, Hujiang, Jiaotong, St. John's, Fudan, Jinan). (2) Since the colleges and vocational schools do not have five schools each, it was decided to merge them into a college and vocational school group, divided into men's and women's divisions (Tongde Medical College, Shanghai Law School, School of Political Science and Law, National Defense Medical College, Guangxia Business Vocational School, Municipal Teachers College, Lixin Accounting, Shanghai Dental College). (3) Only one sports college is participating, so it will be changed to a performance. (4) The list of referees was approved. (5) It was decided to hold the second meeting of representatives from participating schools at 10:00 AM on Thursday, June 3rd, in the conference room of the Municipal Sports College to distribute number cloths, order forms, and other items.

### On "Essentials of Studying the Classics"

— Xiong Shili

Editor's Note: Mr. Xiong Shili's book "Essentials of Studying the Classics" was published in the mainland, and many people in the coastal areas cannot obtain it. This is a masterpiece in the Chinese intellectual world and should not be ignored. This article is a letter from Mr. Xiong to the readers, and the important points of the book are very important. With the permission of Xiong Guangsheng, it is specially disclosed as follows.

The "Essentials" not only solves the problem of studying the classics, but also opens up a new path for the academic and intellectual circles in the two to three thousand years since the Qin and Han dynasties. It is a pity that in a declining world, scholars are accustomed to superficiality and chaos, and there is no one who can speak of this matter.

The first lecture begins with explaining the Dao, which is the main purpose of the new theory. Zong San said that the loss of printing is a ghost, and the loss of Westernization is a thing, which is very gratifying.

Next, speaking of the nine meanings of governance, the preface says, "Governance arises from following the constant Dao," which is the key sentence. The classics say that governance is indeed based on the constant Dao. These nine meanings are broad and profound, and the organization and function of the rule of law are actually included in the rule of virtue or the rule of rites. The nine meanings are extremely harmonious in this kind of place, unlike the pedantic arguments of the former Confucian scholars on the distinction between kingship and hegemony.

Worldly Confucian scholars like to talk about rites and music, but they do not really know rites and music. Among the nine meanings, the best one is on rites and music. The preface and harmony are developed very deeply and far-reachingly. Rites emphasize concession, which seems incompatible with today's Westernization, but I have grasped its basis. One is based on the theory of mutual assistance in science, one is based on the wholeness of the theory of life in philosophy, and the third is based on the spirit of democracy, which also lies in concession. Theory and fact are all-encompassing.

Westerners speak of governance, basing it on desire, while classics scholars speak of governance, basing it on nature. These are all insightful words, unchangeable arguments.

The distinction between nature and emotion was not clear to the former Confucian scholars. In the nine meanings, it is split very actively and meticulously. If you do not reflect on it with your own body, then you will just read it as words, alas.

Human Dao is finite, but desires are infinite. This meaning is vast, profound, and extremely subtle. In the nine meanings, talking about this, the writing is also vast and boundless.

Taking the three outlines and eight items of the Great Learning as the summary and essence of the Six Classics and Confucianism, the more I think about it, the more I feel it is meaningful. The reason for heaven and man is actually prepared in this, and those who are careless and superficially understand people will not realize it. Mingde Zongyang Ming is indeed irreplaceable. Sincerity, then my new interpretation corrects the mistakes of the Song and Ming masters. The investigation of things from Zhu is the most profound meaning. Concluding with Confucian conduct, the classics are complete in every meaning. In short, it is all the constant Dao, all unchangeable.

The second lecture begins with distinguishing the will, which is indeed extremely essential, but it is a pity that today's people cannot speak of this. Then criticizing fame, and explaining it with the three fears, every word is the blood of the sages. If today's scholars never understand, they will only be slaves for all generations, can they learn?

Speaking of Western learning, but not abandoning the classics, there are three meanings, all of which are grand, genuine, and cannot be ignored. The decline of China lies in unification. Chinese people are not weak in scientific thought, nor are they without democratic thought, it is a pity that the environment after Qin restricted them. Recent people only rely on Song and Ming learning, and say that Chinese and Western cultures are absolutely different. After reading the second lecture of the Essentials, they will know that it is not necessarily so.

The criticism of Lao Zhuang is golden words, which cannot be ignored. For more than two thousand years, the Chinese people have lost their vigorous and innovative vitality, Lao Zhuang and Buddhism have misled them. Can this not be deeply studied?

The few paragraphs of criticism of Buddhism are golden words. For two thousand years, Buddhists have not seen this, and those who oppose Buddhism do not study Buddhism at all, so how can they say half a word? Buddhism and Taoism, talking about the essence, are always immersed in emptiness and silence, but the Dao of our Confucian Great Change has never been empty and silent, but it is necessary to see that the essence is originally vigorous. Vigorousness is without any defilement, without a trace of attachment, and has never been empty and silent. The function chapter in the middle volume of the New Theory has already extensively developed this meaning, and my son did not reach this point when he made the commentary. In the Essentials, this kind of place is mentioned from time to time, all of which are essential and cannot be ignored.

Vigorousness is therefore constantly changing, so it is constantly growing. Confucian philosophy can incorporate the West, but it is also very different from the West, because Westerners have little self-reflection and have not seen emptiness, and they only focus on knowledge and little on life.

The evaluation of Lao Fo is the core issue of Chinese academic thought for two to three thousand years and cannot be ignored. My son has already sympathized with the distinction between Han and Song, so I will not mention it again.

The third lecture, speaking of change, still follows the new theory. Its development of vigorousness and growth, and the clarification of the opening of the universe, cannot be said that there is no mind in the age of inorganic matter, but it is just stable and not obvious. In the Qian Gua, the explanation of self-improvement is linked to the evaluation of Zhuangzi in the second lecture. These cannot be ignored. Speaking of change, all talk about governance, and also emphasize that people are autonomous and independent, and do not harm each other. If the world eventually destroys itself, then so be it. If not, then can this meaning be opposed? Modern times emphasize groups too much and harm individuals too much, turning people into machines. This is a real worry for humanity. Our classics can save mankind, and this is where it lies.

Speaking of the Spring and Autumn Annals, change does not lose its constancy. This meaning is best understood in conjunction. The disciples of Kang Youwei only use the method of copying books, picking up the words as talking points, how can they know the meaning of the three generations? In the past, Mr. Zhang Mengqu despised Youwei the most, he had a discerning eye!

Speaking of the Book of Documents, there are not many words, but the meaning is profound and grand. According to the Analects, Mencius, Zuo Zhuan, and the Doctrine of the Mean, we find the tradition of the central method of the Two Emperors and Three Kings, to see where the Dao and the rule of law come from, there is no attachment, so it can be known that the book is a classic and not a history. Speaking of the Book of Poetry, it is based on the words of Confucius. And the Confucian philosophy of life can be seen. Few poets and writers in later generations have mastered the classics.

Speaking of the Three Rites, it is most meaningful. It is necessary to develop reason to save the ills of knowing only the family and not knowing the society. However, the fundamental meaning of rites is seen in the very essence of the records of rites, and we must choose for ourselves. The world is in chaos, and my old age is sad. If the theory cannot be made, then how can it be enough to reach this?

Speaking of the Zhou Rites, there is also a far-reaching meaning. I will mention its outline, and detailed explanation will have to wait for future generations.

### Leisurely Thoughts on the Lake (1)

— Lone Gull

Humanities and Nature

The vastness of the universe can be easily imagined by reading a few modern astronomy books. When you look up at the sky at night, you see thousands of constellations densely surrounding you. But the vastness of the distance between those stars is quite amazing. The stars in space are like a few sailing boats or a few gulls on the sea. We can say that the emptiness in the universe far exceeds the truth. Although those star clusters shine brightly, you can also think that the darkness in the universe far exceeds the light.

There is the sun in the universe, the earth in the solar system, life on earth, and humans in life. The position of humans in the entire universe is really too small. For example, in the vast wilderness of the dark night, there is a little light, which at most only illuminates a few inches of land near it, and the rest is pitch black and completely unknowable. This little light emitted by the course of human life is even more appropriate, it should be like a firefly. Although the firefly flies forward, its light shines on the tail end behind it. Human knowledge can only know what has already happened, and rely on some knowledge and memory of what has already happened to rush forward, towards this infinitely unknowable future.

If you pay too much attention to the natural world, just like a pedestrian in the dark wilderness of the night, always staring into the endless darkness, it will make you terrified and confused. But some people pay too much attention to your personal life. You should know that personal life is still a nature, the same emptiness is better than the truth, darkness is better than the light, the same in the endless darkness, human wisdom has to find the truth in the emptiness and the light in the darkness, that can only be found in the accumulation of the past historical culture of the human group. These cultural heritages (accumulated by the past history of human groups) we call humanities, and use them to oppose nature. This is the truth, the light, but these are just a little light at the tail end of the firefly. How can the historical and cultural heritage accumulated in human life in the past contend and stand side by side with the entire vast universe of the natural world. But as far as people are concerned, this is the only way, this is the so-called human-centered view. In the traditional Chinese view, the natural world is called heaven, and the humanities world is called man. The Chinese use humanities to resist nature on the one hand, and highly raise humanities to stand side by side with nature, but on the other hand, they advocate the unity of heaven and man, and still want both parties to harmonize and integrate, neither talking about nature swallowing up humanities, nor wanting to use humanities to conquer nature.

Taoism also has the theory that heaven and man do not defeat each other, (see Zhuangzi) but Taoism takes too little account of the group work of historical culture. Each individual can only say that his score of heaven is more and his score of man is less. On the one hand, it is great, and on the other hand, it is small. How can heaven and man not defeat each other? Therefore, Xunzi wanted to say that Zhuangzi knew heaven but did not know man. But Xun's claim that human nature is evil does not really recognize the truth of the group work of human historical culture. If you analyze and look at one person after another, then humans do have various shortcomings and various sins. Because each person is only a part of nature. But if you understand the overall view of the historical culture of the human group, then how can all the good in the world be created by the human group work, and how can you say that human nature is evil? Western Christian thought, just as it pays attention to one individual after another, and does not inject its eyes into the accumulating work of the large group of historical culture, therefore it must also advocate that human nature is evil, and say that life and sin come together. In this way, it will inevitably erase life and return to nature. Buddhism also has the same tendency, it is necessary not to value the large group work of historical culture, then it is bound to be pessimistic about life, they only list individual lives to establish arguments, they are not willing to shift their gaze, thinking on the infinite accumulating work of the large group of historical culture. In modern Western thought, freed from their medieval Christian doctrines, they returned to the ancient Greek concept, affirming life positively on the one hand, but on the other hand they still pay too much attention to the individual. As a result, the humanities cannot catch up with natural science, and material ideas are rampant. People with a heart still have to turn back and beg for the spirit of medieval religion to remedy the current pain. As far as personnel are concerned, the way out in the future may only be to dilute individualism, convert to the collective karma of historical culture, and re-propose the old Chinese traditional concept of heaven-man balance and heaven-man unity.

### Aristotle on Individuals and Reality

— One Finger

Plato regarded Ideas as true and things as illusions - in his eyes, Ideas are Reality and things are illusions. Since Aristotle did not agree with the separation of Ideas and things, and since he advocated that concepts be obtained from things, the existence in his mind is things (generally called things, singly called individuals). However, what he calls individuals includes two aspects: (1) concept, (2) matter. The concept he calls form, and the matter he calls matter. These two parts have an inseparable relationship in individuals.

Individuals are the object of all learning. Generally speaking, all learning requires form. The principles and corollaries of science are the forms sought by science, and the concepts and categories of philosophy are the forms sought by philosophy. It's just that the forms sought by each branch of learning have different distances from matter. For example, physics and chemistry are closer to matter, mathematics is farther from matter, and philosophy is even farther from matter. Some people think that philosophy is too mysterious and not practical. In fact, what they call mysterious and impractical is because the form sought by philosophy is relatively far from matter. But everyone knows that the efforts of all learning in the world lie in seeking form, as long as it is based directly or indirectly on matter, and not arbitrarily conceived out of thin air. The form in philosophy is indirectly obtained based on matter, and we cannot blame it - this is one aspect. And the more advanced human culture is, the more everything learning is inclined towards the abstract, that is, the form sought by all learning is farther from matter. The most developed branch of learning now—such as astronomy and physics—uses so much mathematics and is getting closer and closer to mathematics. This is good evidence. Why do people dislike philosophy for being mysterious, why not further dislike mathematics for being mysterious, and further dislike astronomy and physics for being mysterious? Carried to the extreme, it will inevitably lead to disliking all learning for being mysterious, and reverting to the primitive state of ignorance, what is the point of this? This is another aspect. (To be continued)

### Debates in American Educational Philosophy

— Li Ren

Recently, a debate has emerged in American educational circles regarding educational philosophy or ideals. This debate is not purely abstract or theoretical but is related to practice, as they seek immediate reforms to current educational policies. Therefore, the various arguments within the debate are not castles in the air but have already seen some degree of practical implementation. The author believes this debate warrants our attention, and a brief report on its content follows.

From this debate, we can discern three major schools of thought in American educational trends. These three schools are: first, the "Great Books" curriculum, represented by President Hutchins of the University of Chicago; second, the experimental method school, represented by Professor Sidney Hook of New York University, author of "Education for Modern Man"; and third, the eclectic school, represented by the Harvard University report titled "General Education in a Free Society." The first school is somewhat conservative, the second somewhat progressive, and the third seeks a compromise between the old and the new.

According to the educational ideal of the first school, the fundamental nature of humanity is to know. From the knowing nature of humanity, we can deduce the education humans need. Furthermore, although human characteristics may differ slightly depending on time and place, their fundamental nature remains unchanged. Therefore, we can discover a type throughout human history. Using this type can help us understand the present and indicate the future. For the values people hold have an eternal and objective existence. These values are contained in the works of many great figures of the past and passed down to us. We only need to read the works of these great figures to understand and accept these absolute values and truths as the sole reliable guide for our beliefs and behaviors. Therefore, this school advocates that the university curriculum can be limited to a hundred great books. St. John's College in the United States has already implemented this plan.

The educational ideal of the second school opposes the first. This school believes that the arguments of the previous school are too biased towards tradition and authority. Humans do not live in a vacuum but in an environment. The relationship between humans and the environment can be changed. These relationships vary with time and place, so the answers to past problems are not necessarily correct for the present. Humans must use their intelligence to solve their problems. The answers to past problems and traditional values are merely a set of factors to consider when solving problems. The method of dealing with problems should be scientific and experimental. Education should focus on training students to use this method, but there is no single curriculum content to learn. Relying on this experimental method is the hallmark of a democratic polity.

The third school seeks a compromise between the first two, seeking a middle ground. This school, unlike the first, does not advocate for a so-called unchanging fundamental human nature, but seeks to find some common beliefs of humanity as the basis for educational policies. This school believes that some common ground can be found in the tradition of Western culture, and that this tradition contains beliefs that need to be changed. On the one hand, there are unchanging things, and on the other hand, there are things that should be changed; on the one hand, there should be similarities, and on the other hand, there should be differences. Therefore, this school advocates that the university curriculum can provide a common core on the one hand, and cater to the different needs of students on the other. We should train students to have the ability to distinguish values, but we do not need to force students to accept certain values.

Which of the above three schools of thought is correct is not for the author to decide. What the author can suggest is that debates like this in the United States have long existed in our country. The first school can be said to be the classicists, the second the New Culture school, and the third also an eclectic school. Although we do not discuss these issues much now, these issues still exist. Perhaps it is time to re-discuss these issues.

### Gleanings from the Academic World (24)

— Zhang Qiyun

Weng Wenhao on American and Soviet Political Thought

Mr. Weng Wenhao, the newly appointed President of the Executive Yuan, recently published an article in the "Thought and Era" monthly magazine entitled "The Conflict Between American and Soviet Political Thought," indicating the direction China should take in national construction. A brief summary is provided for readers. (The original article is published in the 52nd issue of the magazine, priced at 50,000 yuan per copy. Those interested in purchasing can directly contact the editorial office via National Zhejiang University in Hangzhou.)

Political systems originate from political thought. Different thoughts lead to changes in systems. Unfortunately, after this World War, two fundamentally different ideas are clashing and fighting. The current situation is one of "two major powers in contention," and China is naturally threatened by the ripples.

American thought actually originates from Europe, including countries such as England, France, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy. Even Germany before the Nazi Party came to power, Czechoslovakia before it was controlled by the Soviet Union, and Sweden and Denmark, which are striving to support it, are all on the same track. For the sake of simplification, America is used as a representative name.

In this thought, the first basic principle is human rights. Everyone recognizes that every citizen has the innate right to freedom of thought and action. This is sacred and supreme and cannot be deprived. The second is civil rights. What are civil rights? The government and all institutions are established for the benefit of all citizens. If they violate the interests of the citizens, they have no reason to exist. The third is the national foundation. The existence of the country is a necessary condition for the survival and development of all citizens. All efforts must be made to protect and consolidate it, and no loss can be tolerated. The above three points are the essence of modern political thought and the foundation of democratic politics. Many countries have repeatedly reformed and struggled to achieve this goal.

China's modern political thought also stems entirely from this thought. Based on this thought, the imperial system was overthrown, the Republic of China was established, and the backward warlords and politicians were overthrown, creating a government based on the Three Principles of the People for national construction. It is also because of this thought that all citizens vote to elect and establish a constitutional government that respects civil rights. Although progress has been gradual over the decades, the efficiency is too low, even insufficient, but in general, the overall direction is towards the path of democracy.

Soviet thought openly accuses the politics of countries like America and England as fake democracy and backward systems, without any reservations. This is noteworthy. The government produced by American-style democratic thought must have multiple parties coexisting in its legislative body. The party with more votes can govern because of popular elections, but parties with fewer votes can at least maintain the status of a minority party in the legislative body, monitor the actions of the majority party, express opposing views, and enable the national public to recognize the truth of the matter. This state is considered by American thought to be a necessary condition for a democratic system. In the Soviet constitution, although there is no explicit provision for one-party rule, in fact, there is no participation of any other party besides the Communist Party. Therefore, despite advocating for true democracy, for the collective action of the masses, in reality, the Soviet regime has no possibility of legally changing or discussing with various parties. Soviet politicians have defended this point, saying that it is not that other parties are not allowed, but that the history of the Soviet Union and the Soviet system have completely eliminated all bourgeois prejudices. This statement, of course, runs counter to American democracy.

The political system and thought of the Soviet Union are termed totalitarianism by the English and Americans, similar in nature to the fascism of Italy and the Nazism of Germany before the war. It is believed that there can be no true democratic politics in countries that practice totalitarianism, and that because this kind of politics centers on the glory and achievements of a few powerful figures, it is bound to be insatiable and become an aggressive country that constantly expands outward. Therefore, it is believed that the reason why the world has failed to achieve true peace after the Second World War and why countries still need to deploy large amounts of arms is mainly due to the poor political system in the Soviet Union and its endless ambition abroad.

In this situation of two major powers in contention, China's position, situated in between, is bound to be affected, resulting in psychological turmoil, divergent thoughts, and local chaos. On the one hand, the central government, in accordance with its historical policy of implementing constitutionalism, is returning power to the people and implementing policies in the American way. On the other hand, the Communist Party, based on the doctrines transmitted by the Soviet Union and advocating for New Democracy, is destroying the established order, breaking away from the historical chain, and igniting the flames of war, leaving the people destitute. The causal relationship between the ideological conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union and the political chaos in China is very clear.

In this situation, if our country wants to achieve political stability, it must rely on psychological calmness and ideological clarification. We should emulate the Soviet Union's spirit of active construction and rapid recovery, but its political thought and system are truly different, forming a unique style. It is neither the norm of democratic politics derived from modern evolution, nor is it the path that China should take at this time. China's national construction plan must have foresight, see clearly the trend of history, and understand the actual situation in order to properly determine what to adopt and what to discard, and determine the direction to take. Once the direction is set, we should work together and move forward, so as not to go astray or end up in tragedy.

### The Beijing School

— Bai Yu

The old painter Feng Zikai bowing down before the "skirt" of the King of Opera Mei makes me feel like a victory for the Beijing School. As a Northerner, I am proud of it.

However, the distinction between Beijing and Shanghai originally had nothing to do with birthplace. For example, Dr. Mei is from Taizhou. Mr. Xu Lingyu once referred to him as Mei Taizhou, and believed that he should be ranked alongside Xu Donghai as one of the great figures of modern Wu. If this is the case, then can Mr. Mei be considered a Shanghai School artist? The Beijing School is influenced by the old culture, does not break away from the traditional style, like those who study the classics with a family tradition, and can absorb the strengths of others to digest and nourish their talent. It's a long story, so let's start with a small example, and it also has something to do with the Shanghai School art master Dr. Mei, which can be said to be a coincidence.

I often oppose radio in my writing, especially popular songs and difficult-to-hear jazz Western music. As for the extremely vicious advertisements, which, as the ancients said, "break into the door directly," I can't stand them even more. But recently, Mr. Mei's performances, since I don't have the money to buy tickets, and I don't have the interest in making strange noises and cheering along with others, a friend lent me a radio, and I listened to it all day long. Dr. Mei is called the King of Opera, but he is old, and his voice has an unavoidable dryness. The beauty is late, how can she not be saddened! Thinking back to the time when I listened to operas in Zhonghe Garden in Beijing, I was just a junior high school student, jumping around, not caring at all, while Dr. Mei's graceful demeanor was like a fairy on Miaogu She Mountain. Later, during a charity performance at the First Stage, there were those who came from Tianjin and Tanggu, hundreds of miles away, and even put their luggage in the theater in advance, sleeping and eating there, in order to buy good tickets. How can this kind of grand occasion be seen by today's people! There is no need to repeat these things, I will only introduce the radio announcer who broadcasted Mei's opera. Although she also interspersed reports on a certain brand of wool, she spoke entirely in the gentle tone of the Beijing court, and her main task was to report the plot and tune, combining the strengths of "explaining the opera" and "telling the story," using professional terms to explain the types of tunes, and also mentioning the origin of the performances (such as the fact that "Phoenix Returns to Its Nest" was once taboo because "Phoenix" sounds the same as "Feng," which means to offer [to the emperor]), it was really pleasant to listen to, and made people feel no fatigue. I remember that Mr. Xu Lanyuan, the qin player of the former Mei Opera Troupe, told stories on the Beijing radio, which were delicate and winding, fascinating. Although this lady cannot be compared with him, in the wave of the Shanghai School, she is no less than a refreshing and sobering agent. (Editor's note: Ms. Zhiqing explained when Mei's opera was broadcast.)

Originally, the distinction between Beijing and Shanghai originated in drama. The Shanghai School emphasizes craftsmanship and is close to fire, while the Beijing School emphasizes rules and singing and is close to warmth. Now, they are often mixed together, neither fiery nor warm, both fiery and warm, and even turned into a hybrid, such as the popular Eighteen Arhats subduing Dapeng and opera fans spinning cotton in their homes. The true Beijing School should cry bitterly for this, and the true Shanghai School (such as Zhou Xinfang) would also disdain this. Isn't it impossible to please either side? Measuring Chinese culture by this standard can often be viewed in this way. The sign of neither Chinese nor Western, the houses of neither native nor foreign, the paintings of both Chinese and Western, the articles of both Chinese and Western, are all things that can make people unhappy, just like serving Western steak with Chinese porridge, it is not very comfortable to eat, or it is not even steak, it is simply stinky tofu dried radish with tomatoes!

As early as before the war, around 1933, there was a debate between Beijing and Shanghai writers. The issue was raised by Shen Congwen, Ba Jin, and others. Those who launched a revolution in literature and art were from the North, which was extremely feudalistic, while those who advocated conservatism were from the South, reaching as far as Guangzhou, Kowloon, Hong Kong, and Macao. This seems strange, but in fact, the South was the base of the imperialists, and it was no accident that they rejected new ideas. But later, the South developed into both the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly School and the revolutionary school, while the literary atmosphere in the North transformed into academic research. Literature, history, and social sciences all took a new scientific path in the North. In particular, in the fields of literature and history, a large amount of Western scientific thought permeated the Qing people's textual research methods, almost completely changing the tradition of two thousand years, and its influence on modern culture is indeed not small. At the same time, in Shanghai, the center of the Shanghai School, there still gathered flows of Jinshi graduates and Hanlin scholars, lecturing on Tongcheng prose and Song and Ming Neo-Confucianism, which is an immeasurable distance away. This is something that the Northerners did not expect.

Those who are good at preserving tradition are creative, adding new human labor on the old side base or in the old hall, so that it is new even though it is old. Those who are not good at preserving tradition are only waiting for the rabbit by the tree, until the halls and pavilions collapse and are destroyed, and then they cry and sigh and leave. Dr. Mei's opera studies, whether in terms of endowment or skill, all come from a family tradition, but in improving Peking Opera, he also absorbed the strengths of modern drama (note that this is not an incongruous, neither Chinese nor Western, Western-style facade improvement, but a harmonious, Chinese-oriented improvement). Therefore, he was able to make a name for himself in Europe and the United States and revitalize the national opera. This is the tactic of defending by attacking in military strategy, which is a characteristic of the Beijing School preserving tradition. Looking back at literature and art, it is mostly the same. Even an advertising announcer knows this trend of improvement, because they have taken the essence from history and made great use of it, and have also opened up communication between China and foreign countries in terms of geography, so their special achievements are very different from those with shallow foundations who regard ordinary stones as beautiful jade.

### A Hundred Billion Yuan for a Smile

— Kai

In the past, our country had the saying "a thousand gold for a smile," but now that times have advanced, it takes a hundred billion yuan for a smile.

The origin of "a hundred billion yuan for a smile" is a recent real event in the United States: A family's electrical wire was broken and they refused to repair it. So, on a night of wind and rain, this broken wire hung down by the side of the road. A child happened to walk by, and his face touched the wire. He was immediately electrocuted and injured, and passed out.

The child was sent to the hospital and treated for several months, and finally recovered from his injuries. His parents hired a lawyer for him and demanded that the family who refused to repair the wire compensate for the losses.

In court, the lawyer suddenly called the child to face the jurors in the court. The lawyer said, "Child, smile!"

The child tried hard to smile, but—only half of his face showed a smile, while the other half had been burned like ham that day when he was electrocuted, revealing only a few deep, ugly wrinkles.

The jurors only deliberated for a few minutes and immediately ruled in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant was ordered to pay the plaintiff damages of $20,000.

This $20,000 is the price of that poor child's smile. Regardless of the value of the black market exchange rate, even according to the statutory purchase price, isn't the value of this smile close to 100 billion yuan?

### Autobiography of a Train Porter

— Lei Hong

I am a train porter in a first-class carriage, and I have been taking care of passengers on trains for forty-three years. In the past, what you had to worry about on the train was the passengers' health, opening and closing windows, and wiping away dust for the passengers after a dusty journey...etc. But now that there is air conditioning, there is no need to "wipe the dust." Today, the first duty of a train porter is to make you feel comfortable and help you enjoy this journey.

Because the train equipment is now advanced, the responsibilities of a train porter can be reduced a lot. In fact, there are still many places where he can be of service, especially in times of crisis. There is a first-class carriage called "Daniel" because a train porter named Daniel saved many lives in a train accident. That is why this carriage is called "Daniel." Originally, the train head crashed into this carriage, but Daniel risked his life to close the car door to prevent steam from entering.

Disputes in the car, such as domestic quarrels, are not something that the train porter should advise on, but sometimes when you see that a couple is getting more and more rigid, the best way is still to boldly ask about their trouble. The most troublesome thing on the journey is quarreling. Once a young couple came on the train. They had only been married for three months. Because the woman went to another carriage to find a friend and sat and talked for two hours, the husband quarreled with her loudly when she came back. Later, she threatened to go home when the train stopped at the next stop.

"That's a good idea!" the husband said, "I think this is going back to your house..."

"Don't do that," I said to her. We recognized the two of them, and also recognized their parents and friends, who brought flowers to the station to see them off. I pulled the man aside, and said to him like an uncle, "If your wife goes back alone, it will make your parents and her parents sad, and the friends who see them off, and the people who come to meet them in New Orleans, will be disappointed. They specially came to me to ask me to take care of you during the journey. Therefore, I will lock your luggage and refuse to open the car door at the next stop. When you are in the lounge, you can let you quarrel all night.

The next morning, they ran out smiling. Now they are a happy pair of grandparents. I sometimes think, if I hadn't intervened, I don't know where the two of them would have separated.

What makes the train porter most headache is looking for lost items on the train. Once, on a train to Minneapolis, at four o'clock in the morning, a panicked old woman ran to tell me that her wife had lost a diamond ring. I knew she had gotten up in the middle of the night, so I went to the dressing room to look for it. But there was nothing. I noticed that one of the two women in the lower berth No. 10 also got up in the middle of the night. An idea popped into my head, and I "squeezed" out a "clue."

No matter who took the diamond ring, it is not convenient to admit it now, because she did not report it immediately when she got the diamond ring. I decided to let her surrender automatically, in order to respect her personality. I stood in front of the lower berth No. 10, shouting as if I was talking to the old couple: "It's okay, the conductor has telegraphed to the police station at the next stop. This carriage will be sealed off for a full inspection when it arrives." So I ran to the smoking room and waited. Not long after, the bell in the lower berth No. 10 rang, and the woman said that she found the ring in the dressing room, "but I don't know what to do!"

### Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

Most people are too bad to be good people, and too good to be bad people. —Therefore, in this world, there are few truly bad and good people, just like phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.

Don't plant roses, tuberoses, and violets in the peony garden, although they are all very fragrant and beautiful. But one kind is enough.

A rotten apple will not make the apple tree rotten, but a rotten apple tree cannot bear fruit.

Life is an endless heavy burden: there are many visible burdens of life, and many invisible burdens of emotion. Just looking at the tombstones among the weeds and poplars, there is still such a heavy burden even after death;——you can still get rid of it.

The clearly remembered happiness, even more clearly, is like looking through a veil; the forgotten sorrows, even if they are forgotten cleanly, will still suspect that it is a clear shadow in a sigh.

### Record of the "Peace Flower"

— Chen Meng'an

On May 20th of the 19th year of the Republic of China, the Palace Museum in Beiping held a large garden party to entertain Chinese and foreign dignitaries, all because the "Peace Flower" in the Imperial Garden was in full bloom. Many photos were taken at that time, and the term "Peace Flower" caused quite a sensation. However, it was not easy to see elsewhere. Some people said: this is a specialty of the palace, and it cannot be transplanted; if it is transplanted, it will not grow. According to what is said in ancient books, like the "Brief Records of Products of Yi Province": "The Auspicious Saint Flower comes from the mountains of Qingcheng. The trunk is not striped, and the tall ones are several fathoms high. The flowers usually bloom in autumn, with four petals like peach blossoms, but dozens are combined into one flower, densely packed like being sewn together, blooming one after another, with new buds opening and old ones not yet withered. The people of Shu call it the Abundant Auspicious Flower. Therefore, Minister Cheng drew a picture to report it, and it was renamed the Auspicious Saint Flower. However, there are several kinds, the small ones are called Precious Immortals, the light red ones are called Drunken Peace, and the white ones are named Jade Truth. The people of Chengdu compete to transplant them into their gardens, considering them a special delight." Gao Shiqi's "Remaining Knowledge of Heavenly Prosperity": "The Peace Flower is from Jiannan, Sichuan. It resembles a peach with four petals, with hundreds or thousands of buds clustered together to form a flower. During the Tiansheng era of the Song Dynasty, it was presented to the capital, and Emperor Renzong named it the Peace Flower. (The annotations on the poems of Jiannan are similar, except that the name given was the Peace Auspicious Saint Flower instead of Peace Flower.)" According to the above two statements, it is a product of Sichuan, but later generations regarded it as something special to the imperial palace. The Northern Song Dynasty established its capital in Henan, but I don't know when it was moved to Beijing? Then the saying "it will not grow if transplanted" is unreliable. The "Brief Records of Products of Yidu" says "the flowers usually bloom in autumn," but the garden party at the Palace Museum was held in May, so the time of blooming becomes a problem. Song Fan Chengda's poem on the Peace Auspicious Saint Flower: "Holding onto spring and living into summer, watching the fire star flow westward." This can prove that it does bloom in early summer. In the garden of Qiu at the Hualong Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in this city, there is a tree with white flowers, all with four petals, and occasionally five petals, with a slight fragrance. At first glance, it doesn't seem special, but upon careful examination, there are some unique features. The flowers are commonly called "Foreign Begonias." One day, Dr. He Shixi broke off a branch and inserted it into a vase, but no one recognized its true name. The old actor Wei Miaokan, an expert in growing flowers, having cultivated seventy or eighty kinds of exotic flowers, said: This is the "Peace Flower"! Comparing it to the photos from the Palace Museum, it is exactly right, precisely "hundreds or thousands of buds clustered together to form a flower," and also "blooming one after another, with new buds opening and old ones not yet withered," a kind called "Jade Truth." Investigating its origin, it was originally bought as a potted landscape from a flower shop, and later gradually grew larger and was transplanted to the ground, only two or three years ago. Although it hasn't reached "several fathoms high," it is already five or six feet tall. Dr. He is taking photos of it and writing poems about it, which is indeed an excellent source of poetic inspiration. The Peace Flower, a symbol of peace, has had its true identity buried for several years because the world points at a deer and calls it a horse. Now is the time for it to come into its own, right?

### 

Since entering summer, the climate has been , and the body is unable to resist, often suffering from dizziness and weakness, unable to go out, and sleeping often. When awake, I browse Qu Yuan's Collected Works to slightly break the silence, and I often have thoughts about humanity, nature, and myself. Yu Yue lectured at Jiangzhe academies for decades, serving as the elder statesman of literature in the southeast. His writings are vast and his language is classical and elegant, especially in poetry, following the style of Xiangshan, not aiming for high antiquity, but naturally elegant and rhythmic, fully expressing his intentions and emotions. His late-year works on old age are all real and true. When young people read them, they may not be able to understand them, but as old age approaches and signs of decline increase, after repeated contemplation, they feel that every word is spoken for me, but I am ashamed of not having the old man's gentle and sincere writing style. For example, he said: "Before old age, youth has already declined early, let alone this year, old age is even more declining and weak. Sparse teeth have long abandoned the toothpick, and numb bones frequently use the back-tapping mallet. When sitting, one must lean on a long pillow, and when standing, one must rely on a short crutch. I was like this at seventy, not believing that there is senility in the world." I have not reached seventy but have suffered from stomach ailments for many years, and I dare not eat my fill at every meal. However, in the year of victory, I was still able to eat one steamed bun or one bowl of rice, but in the past two years, my teeth have gradually fallen out. Every time a tooth falls out, the adjacent one will become loose and follow, once, twice, three times, until now, only three remain on the upper and lower gums, completely useless. Not only are the teeth sparse, but they are also completely gone—reading further, "In the morning, avoid meat and eat white porridge, in the evening, prevent thinning and sip black tea," and "Accumulated phlegm becomes drink and frequent sour vomiting," everything coincides with my current situation. Because of toothlessness, I can only eat thin porridge; because of a weak stomach, I often vomit after eating a little more. And sitting requires a chair, and walking requires a cane, which has been the case for some time now. The old man also said: "Living alone deeply suffers from indigestion, and I also fear the clamor of numerous guests and friends. Remembering childhood feels recent, and even thinking of outside the door feels distant." Indeed, in youth, passing a month is just passing a month, and passing a year is just passing a year, and the length and duration of years, months, days, and hours are clearly distinguished. In old age, with a slight recollection, everything seems like yesterday. This kind of feeling cannot be fully understood without reaching this kind of state. I also recall that Mr. Yan Fansun's elegiac poem from the year of Ji Si said: "I used to say that youth is hard to age, who knew that white hair would urge people on!" These are also sentences where the feeling is true because the situation is real. In my decades of life, I have either taught or written manuscripts. Of the national and private schools in Beiping, those with whom I have the relationship of guest and host account for six or seven tenths; of the newspapers in Shanghai, Ningbo, Tianjin, and Beiping, those with whom I have literary exchanges also account for seven or eight tenths. Pouring my heart and soul out of my wrist, I have written countless words (now it should be said "billions" of words)! Those who used to write at the same time have either changed careers or passed away, but I am still using this writing brush (not used to fountain pens), still bent over my desk, so the various states of decline are not unexpected. I have gray hair and missing teeth, eat little and am often sick, and prolonging life with illness has not been just for a day. I usually pay no attention to the length of life, and I feel that the old sayings about wealth, honor, and longevity are clichés, but I also feel that being passively world-weary and chanting sutras is unnecessary. I let nature take its course. Qu Yuan's old man said that he viewed life and death like traveling to and from Suzhou and Hangzhou, which is very true. As for his lines "Red dust easily ages the soaring crane" and "It is difficult to keep the white sun from going to the firm snake," they are precisely the words to write on my desk.
