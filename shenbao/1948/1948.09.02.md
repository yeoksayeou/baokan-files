### U.S. Aid Industrial Component Grant; Four Units First to Receive Assistance; Kailuan Mines, Yangzi Electric Power, Jibei Electric Power, and Taiwan Sugar Company; A Total of $4.4 Million Allocated

[Our Newspaper Report] Yan Jiagan, a member of the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee, Raymond Lapham, Director of the ECA China Mission, and Leighton Stuart, Director of the Construction Survey Team of the Mission, jointly held a press conference at the China Hotel here at 10:00 AM yesterday, announcing that among the $35 million in grants for industrial components, the first to receive assistance are Kailuan Mines, Yangzi Electric Power Company, Jibei Electric Power Company, and Taiwan Sugar Company. The total amount allocated is $4.4 million.

Importance of the Four Units

Yan Jiagan first described the importance of the businesses of the four units:

(1) Yangzi Electric Power Company, including the Qishuyan Power Plant, supplies electricity to the Nanjing Qishuyan area. Due to a shortage of components, the power generation is insufficient to meet the industrial needs of the area. It is now legally allocated $1.2 million to increase production and promote employment opportunities in the area. The project is undertaken by Andersen, Meyer & Co.

(2) Kailuan Mines Company, the amount of coal supplied by the mine accounts for 50% of the national coal production. Today, in addition to being the main coal source in North China, it is also the supply base of coal for Central China (including Shanghai). Shanghai's electricity is the source of its industry. Therefore, Shanghai's fuel supply relies on Kailuan coal. However, the current situation of the mine is extremely bad. If it is not actively repaired, the mining work will collapse as a whole. A special allocation of $1 million is made for renovation, and the project is undertaken by Jardine Engineering Corporation.

(3) Jibei Electric Power Company, this was originally one of the important projects of the National Resources Commission and is of great importance to the industrial production of North China. In the past, the company was unable to fully supply electricity due to a lack of important equipment. This time, a special allocation of $1.2 million is made to supplement it, and the project is undertaken by the Wiley & Han Company.

(4) Taiwan Sugar Company, the importance of the company lies in its ability to export surplus sugar and earn valuable foreign exchange resources for the country. Therefore, $1 million is allocated to increase production. The entire project is undertaken by the American Transportation Corporation.

Yan said: The above four units and the allocated $4.4 million are just the beginning of the utilization of the $35 million in industrial component funds. On behalf of the government and the people, he expressed his gratitude to Raymond Lapham, Leighton Stuart, and the work and efforts of the ECA Mission. He also said: With the joint efforts and cooperation of the Chinese and American governments, the utilization of U.S. aid can achieve the greatest success.

Leighton Stuart's Speech

Leighton Stuart led the Construction Survey Team to extensively study the major needs of Chinese industry over the past three months. According to his statement, the above four types of enterprises are very important in the Chinese economy, so they were selected as the targets of the first batch of allocations. Stuart also said: "We have tried our best to select appropriate targets from among the many applicants for assistance, and our goal is to make the best use of our funds within a reasonable period of time. Furthermore, we have taken serious steps in the implementation, procurement, installation, and financial allocation of the project, so that everything we implement or sponsor can achieve perfect results, in order to increase production and benefit the Chinese people. Starting with these four types of enterprises is also a test of the plans and steps we intend to take, and to determine whether they are indeed effective in practice." Stuart then explained the procurement and transportation of industrial components. He said: All components that originally existed in China or that can be manufactured domestically will be utilized as a priority, in order to save foreign exchange. Even if it is necessary to purchase from abroad, it can be purchased from any country with superior efficiency in producing industrial components. The prerequisites are the price and the length of the delivery time. Regardless of whether the required materials are produced in China, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, or any other country. Stuart specially distributed the articles of the oath that commercial groups or government agencies participating in construction and industrial component plans should sign, explaining the U.S.'s purpose in revitalizing the world and promoting international trade. Stuart also said: This oath is a direct answer to the general public's so-called purpose of U.S. aid to open up markets for U.S. surplus materials.

Stuart explained in his written remarks yesterday: The Chinese and American governments have decided in principle to allocate $70 million specifically for industrial components and construction plans. The original plan was to allocate $10 million in the form of a grant for the procurement of components, and another $60 million in the form of a loan for construction. However, after on-site surveys, it is firmly believed that what China needs most today is the supply of components. The Chinese government also agreed with this, and as a result, $35 million of the $70 million was allocated in the form of a grant for components.

He said: "We have formulated a plan to ensure that the various industries that receive assistance can proceed smoothly in the procurement, transportation, installation, and use of raw materials and equipment, and that what is transported to China is not just materials for stockpiling in warehouses, but all practical components. And in the implementation of this plan, we can obtain the sincere cooperation of our Chinese colleagues."

Raymond Lapham Expresses Satisfaction

Raymond Lapham, Chairman of the reception, expressed his satisfaction at the meeting that the component replenishment and construction plans have begun to be implemented in China. He also said that this move will greatly improve China's economic situation.

Lapham also said: "This is a real beginning, and it is the product of in-depth research by many enthusiastic people. Under our limited economic capacity, they have tried their best to improve the current situation of this great country. The Survey Team has always received the assistance and cooperation of the Chinese government in its work. This kind of cooperation makes me firmly believe that from this small beginning, we will have a great future."

Editorial

### The Key to Solving the German Problem

4.  The constitutional convention has already opened in Bonn, the hometown of Beethoven, and will begin drafting a national democratic constitution in accordance with the provisions of the London Six-Power West German Agreement. Regardless of the outcome of the Moscow negotiations, or how the Berlin crisis may evolve in the future, the imminent birth of the "Second German Republic" is a major event in current international politics worthy of attention.

The recent uncertainty in the European situation is like the hail season, with alternating sunshine and rain, almost unpredictable. On the one hand, the Moscow negotiations have made progress and could have ended with a communiqué, but they were abandoned due to the sudden rise of the French political crisis. The haze in the international situation has not yet been completely swept away; in addition, the Soviet spy case occurred in the United Kingdom, causing both sides to close their consulates. Although it will not directly affect the Moscow negotiations, the deteriorating relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union seems to be increasingly evident. On the other hand, the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin, because the Moscow negotiations have taken a turn for the better, is not as severe as before, and the Berlin crisis seems to be disappearing. However, the German Communists have been holding demonstrations in Berlin for days, breaking into the Berlin City Hall in an attempt to overthrow the democratically elected government of Berlin by force, causing a great uproar in Berlin, which has been rising and falling in crisis for more than sixty days. Although the four Allied commanders in Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, also met the day before yesterday to discuss the unified currency system and the lifting of the blockade, the world does not place much hope on it. These bright and uncertain phenomena all illustrate the depression and subtlety of the European situation after the war.

In fact, the so-called German problem was originally a common problem for the Allied countries after the war. How to clean up the post-war European mess, how to control defeated Germany so that it cannot rise again to aggression, the interests of the Allied countries were originally completely consistent; however, after Nazi Germany surrendered, the Allied countries repeatedly held international conferences to discuss the German problem, but they never reached a common and consistent policy, so that the German peace conference has not yet been convened. Now, the so-called German problem has fundamentally changed its nature. Therefore, today's German problem has become a US-Soviet problem, and both sides regard Germany as an object to be won. Nothing is more strange than this. On the Western Allied side, from the merger of the three occupation zones to the currency reform in West Germany, they have always wanted to support the revival of the German economy, so that Germany can be their anti-communist vanguard in Europe, so that the Soviet Union's power cannot cross the border. However, on the Soviet side, they are doing everything possible to win people's hearts in their occupation zone, creating an anti-American psychology among the German people, and attempting to drive the United States, Britain, and France out of Berlin, so that the German Communists can organize a "People's Government" in Berlin, participate in the new Communist International, and engage in anti-American and anti-imperialist work. Therefore, the current crisis caused by the Soviet blockade of Berlin, strictly speaking, is a battle between the Soviet Union and the Western Allies, which has really exceeded the general so-called "Cold War."

From the day the Soviet Union blockaded Berlin, it has been more than two months, and the world is watching with bated breath for the Berlin situation to turn from danger to safety. But until now, we have only seen the negotiations in Moscow. From July 30th, the envoys of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have been conducting negotiations with Molotov and Stalin in Moscow, and it has only achieved a preliminary result. It cannot be said that it has done everything possible to circumvent and twist, and this result is only that Stalin agreed that the Western Allies should jointly control the currency in Berlin, and there is still a considerable distance from the solution of the Berlin problem. Perhaps, it may be a change in Soviet diplomatic tactics. Since the Soviet Union cannot force the Western Allies to withdraw from Berlin by means of blockade and intimidation, it will naturally have to change its tactics and rely on the German Communists. On the eve of the German Communists' entry into the Berlin City Hall, more than 3,000 representatives of the German Socialist Unity Party held a conference. The party leader, Pieck, not only criticized the Berlin City Government for resisting Soviet government orders, but also openly demanded that the Western Allies withdraw from Berlin. Observing only from this perspective, the Soviet Union's intentions can be clearly seen.

In short, the Berlin crisis has not passed, and the future of the negotiations is not optimistic. The most urgent problem at present is to clarify the situation in Berlin. It is absolutely necessary to prevent any complications. If the actions of the German Communists are not stopped immediately, the Western Allies will never be able to fully trust the true intentions of the Soviet Union. The Soviet military commander in Berlin's refusal to the city government's request to delineate a neutral zone is particularly unwise. We believe that only under the condition of maintaining the status quo in Berlin can negotiations be conducted to achieve a solution. Therefore, the actions of the German Communists in Berlin are crucial to the success or failure of the four-power negotiations and are also the key to solving the German problem.

### The Entire Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is Open to Traffic; Connecting in Three Sections; Prices Along the Line Soar; Armed Theft of Materials Occurs Repeatedly

[Report from Hangzhou, this newspaper, 1st] The entire Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has opened to traffic starting today. It is now operating in three sections. The direct train from Hangzhou to Nanchang and the intercity train from Nanchang to Zhangshu remain the same. The direct train from Zhangshu to Zhuzhou operates daily in both directions. The times of the three sections are all connected, and the entire journey can be reached in fifty-six hours.

[Report from Nanchang, this newspaper, 1st] After the Zhang-Zhu section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was connected, the round-trip project of the entire 1,150 kilometers was completed starting today. The railway bureau inspection team, including Sun Cheng and others, went west to test the track, and the results were good. The team held a meeting in Zhu on the 30th and decided to strengthen transportation in the western section in the short term, and determined the driving schedule and ticket prices for the Zhangshu section. The entire section takes 19 hours and 11 minutes, which can be connected with Nan-Zhang and Nan-Hang, which is convenient for passengers. The railway bureau also decided to add stone ballast and replace light rails in the short term, which can increase driving efficiency.

### If Berlin Negotiations Proceed Smoothly, Foreign Ministers' Meeting Possible; Four-Power Governors Hold Second Meeting

[Our Dispatch] Washington, 1st (Broadcast): Diplomatic circles predict that if the Berlin negotiations proceed smoothly, a Four-Power Foreign Ministers' meeting will finally be held in Paris in late September. The United Nations General Assembly is scheduled to be held in Paris on September 19th, indicating that the meeting will provide an opportunity for the Four-Power Foreign Ministers to resume negotiations. It is generally hoped that discussions on technical issues related to Berlin currency and the lifting of the blockade will reach a satisfactory conclusion before the United Nations General Assembly convenes.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 1st] The U.S. military intelligence agency announced today that the second meeting of the Four-Power military commanders will be held at 5:00 PM today at the Berlin Control Council. The Four-Power military commanders' meeting is expected to establish several committees to study the issues discussed on the agenda, especially the establishment of a financial committee to study currency issues, and a transportation committee to study the restoration of traffic between Berlin and the Western occupation zones. However, according to Soviet officials on the Control Council who are close to Soviet news outlets, the Four-Power military commanders' meeting does not mean the restoration of the Four-Power Control Council. Furthermore, according to German sources, Berlin Soviet Commander General Kotikov has already instructed the Soviet Economic Committee and banks in the Soviet zone to take all necessary measures to make the new Soviet Mark circulate in the western districts of Berlin. It has also been learned that railway engineers are now inspecting the railway line on the border between Magdeburg and the Western occupation zone. This is seen by all parties as an indication that once the Moscow conference reaches an agreement allowing the lifting of the Berlin blockade, freight and passenger trains between the Western occupation zone and the Soviet zone will resume.

[United Press, Berlin, 1st] The Four-Power Transportation Committee discussed the lifting of the Berlin blockade on the 1st. According to reliable sources, Western supply trains may enter Berlin on the 5th. Berlin has been blockaded by the Soviets for seventy-four days to date.

U.S. Governor Clay arrived last, accompanied by a political advisor, Murphy.

[United Press, Moscow, 31st] After 24 hours of intense activity, Western envoys began to rest on the afternoon of the 31st, and the Four-Power negotiations on Berlin have apparently entered a new stage.

A spokesman for the British Foreign Office in London stated that the "current stage" of the Moscow negotiations has come to an end. He said that there will be no more negotiations in Moscow until the four commanders-in-chief stationed in Germany agree on the details of the Berlin monetary system. At the same time, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith and British Special Envoy Roberts refused to comment on the news that the heatwave of the Moscow negotiations had temporarily subsided. However, Smith and Roberts went to the British Embassy on the evening of the 31st to watch the British film "Anna Karenina," which was the first free time for Smith and Roberts in several days.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 31st] The Berlin City Council decided today that it would not hold any more meetings before the publication of the communique from the Moscow Conference. The City Council also decided that it could not further discuss the proposal to establish a neutral zone until Berlin Soviet Commander Kotikov had responded to the proposal.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 1st] None of the newspapers here today mentioned the statement issued by London regarding the preliminary results of the German question. Also, the British and American embassies here did not comment on the London statement.

### Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Meeting Concludes Suggestions on Italian Colonies Will Be Submitted to Foreign Ministers' Meeting Countries Have Divergent Opinions on This Issue

[Agence France-Presse, London, 1st] The meeting of the representatives of the Four Foreign Ministers held here has decided to submit the suggestions on Italian colonies to the meeting of the Four Foreign Ministers for discussion. The resolution of the meeting also mentioned China, one of the nineteen countries that expressed opinions on this issue.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 31st] The meeting of the Four Deputy Foreign Ministers, which began on August 9th to consider the issue of former Italian colonies, closed this evening at Lancaster House. A brief communique was issued that evening stating: "The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers will submit the suggestions agreed upon in the past three weeks to their respective governments." The communique was simple and the officials remained silent. It is generally believed that this must be due to the fact that the delegations of the four countries had very different opinions on the future of the former Italian colonies. According to reliable observers, this difference of opinion was caused by the attitude of the British delegation, because the French and Soviet delegations repeatedly supported the return of the former Italian colonies to Italy, while the British strongly opposed this solution. The reason why the British delegation insisted on this attitude was entirely due to the strategic importance of the status of the former Italian colonies.

### French National Assembly Passes Vote of Confidence Schumann Coalition Cabinet Socialist Party Meets and Decides to Join New Cabinet

[United Press, Paris, 1st] French Prime Minister Schumann stepped up his efforts on the 1st to organize a "streamlined" coalition cabinet to resist labor's wage increase and price reduction strikes. Schumann hoped to form a new cabinet on the 2nd, but still disagreed with the Socialist Party. Many Socialist Party leaders opposed the party joining Schumann's government, and Schumann calmly waited and dealt with it. The Socialist Party held a meeting on the morning of the 1st and immediately decided to join the cabinet.

At the same time, Schumann was looking for a finance minister.

### Economic Police Continue to Inspect Various Textile Factories; Yarn Stored in More Than Ten Factories Sealed; Chiang Ching-kuo Condemns Manufacturers for Not Selling and Taking a Wait-and-See Attitude; Decisive Measures Will Be Taken if They Continue to Delay

[Our Dispatch] After the economic police brigade of the Police Department sealed up the public and private warehouses in the city that stored cotton cloth and cotton yarn for more than three months, yesterday it dispatched a large number of personnel to conduct surprise inspections of textile factories of all sizes in the city. It was found that more than ten factories, including the Yong'an Third Textile Factory, had stored a large amount of cotton yarn, which had also been stored for more than three months. The inspection personnel immediately sealed them one by one and reported them to the higher authorities for processing.

[Our Dispatch] Supervisor Chiang Ching-kuo summoned the responsible persons of the China Textile Construction Company, Shu Yunzhang and Wu Weijing, at 10:00 AM yesterday to exchange opinions on the supply and price of cloth. Chiang pointed out at the time that since the implementation of price limits, cloth transactions have been rare, affecting the supply. Although the Textile Construction Company distributes cloth in a continuous stream, the cloth shops take a wait-and-see attitude after receiving the cloth, and the amount of cloth sold is not large, which is suspected of hoarding. He hoped that the Textile Construction Company could conduct a detailed investigation of this matter. At the same time, the private textile factories have sold very few finished products in recent days, and most of them are taking a wait-and-see attitude, which is not an attitude they should have. He hopes that these manufacturers can take into account the interests of the country and society and make some sacrifices. In the afternoon, Chiang summoned Wang Qiyu, a tycoon in the yarn industry, and instructed the private textile factories to sell a large amount of finished products. If the cost is insufficient, they can reduce the cost of cotton yarn production by suppressing the price of raw cotton and opening up sources of cotton. The current wait-and-see attitude of private textile factories is really undesirable. If the situation does not change, decisive measures will be taken in the shortest possible time to correct it.

### To Prevent the Smuggling of Goods; Police and Military Cooperate to Organize Inspection Stations

If any smuggling is found, in addition to confiscating all the goods, the instigator will also be severely punished. The inspection work began yesterday.

[Also] In order to make the above inspection work more detailed, Police Commissioner Yu yesterday specially ordered the Investigation Team of the Economic Brigade of the Bureau to draft inspection methods for the smuggling of goods by sea, land, air, and highway, so as to facilitate the inspection work. It is said that the measures will be drafted soon and can be implemented within a week.

### Economic Inspection Conference to Be Held Today Some Commodity Prices Are Still Restless Temporary Phenomenon Can Be Suppressed

Although some commodity prices are under the strict control of the authorities, they are still restless. However, Chiang Ching-kuo's confidence is still firm. He believes that this is a temporary phenomenon and will be suppressed with decisive action in a day or two.

### National Bank Materials and Finance Committee Decides to Expedite the Sale of Materials

### Price Limits on Rice, Oil, and Miscellaneous Grains Social Affairs Bureau Urges Compliance

[Our Dispatch] The Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday convened the responsible persons of the city's North and South Rice Markets, Rice Industry Association, Miscellaneous Grain Market, Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association, Oil Market, Oil Pressing Industry Association, and Oil Business Association for a meeting. Section Chief Ji instructed rice, oil, and miscellaneous grain merchants to strictly abide by the government's regulations and sell according to the 8/19 price limits, and not to exceed them. As for the warehouse receipts for edible oil that were previously allowed to be stored, they must be cleared within one week to prevent hoarding and speculation. The prices of rice have been preliminarily approved, and the prices of miscellaneous grains are more complicated and have not yet been determined. The Social Affairs Bureau previously convened flour merchants to talk and urged them to strictly abide by the price limits. However, according to flour merchants, if the price is based on the 8/19 price, the factory price is higher than the wholesale price, and the wholesale price is equal to the retail price. This price is difficult to maintain for a long time. The Social Affairs Bureau will ask the Economic Supervisor for instructions on this and then make a decision. After the prices of rice, flour, miscellaneous grains, and edible oil are reviewed together, they will be submitted to the municipal government for approval and announcement.

### Zhuzhen Boundary Demarcation Issue: Zhuzhen Residents Still Oppose Partition

[Our Report] The dispute over the boundary demarcation between Zhuzhen and Shanghai municipality has lasted for more than a year. The residents of the area are firmly demanding that the entire town be incorporated into Shanghai. They have repeatedly launched petitions, arguing their case rationally. However, the central government recently announced that half of Zhuzhen will still be under the jurisdiction of the provincial government. Upon hearing the news, residents were deeply disappointed, believing that this would lead to discrepancies in political facilities and hinder various constructions such as economic and educational development. Especially during the period of suppressing the rebellion, local security is a concern and will become a hidden danger in the urban area. Moreover, dividing a town into three parts is fragmented and unreasonable. The residents of the entire town are determined to continue their opposition and are unwilling to be divided at all costs. It is reported that local construction promotion associations and other social groups in the town will launch petitions again, requesting the central government to withdraw its decision and make reasonable arrangements.

### China Textile Corporation's Assets Total $300 Million USD, Inventory Taken to Capital for Government Reference

[Our Report] The news that the assets of China Textile Construction Corporation are to be converted into marketable securities and stocks will be issued in mid-month has already been reported in this newspaper yesterday. It is now learned that the company's assets were estimated at more than 145 million US dollars at that time, which only included machinery and real estate. Raw materials, finished products, public dormitories, and assets of the Northeast Branch were not included. The unincluded assets are estimated at around 150 million US dollars, so the total assets are around 300 million US dollars. The company has decided to list the unestimated assets separately and will have the company's chief engineer, Ouyang Lun, take them to the capital again today for government reference. In addition, the company is currently designing and rushing to print the issued stocks to be able to release them onto the market in a timely manner.

### Price Limits Announced, Vegetable Market Calm

Producer Pig Prices Have Risen, Merchants Fearing Supply Exhaustion

[Our Report] The price limits for various meat and vegetable dishes, after being approved by the Social Affairs Bureau, were jointly announced yesterday by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau. The two bureaus sent personnel to inspect various vegetable markets yesterday, and the situation was generally good. Pork and other daily vegetables were sold in accordance with the prescribed prices. However, there are still problems with the supply of pork. Due to the strict requirement to follow the price of August 19, there is a risk of supply exhaustion. According to pork merchants, the wholesale price of pork is 4.8 jinyuan per jin, which is based on the price of August 19. However, the price of August 19 was based on the price of August 11 and 12 in the northern Jiangsu production area. Since then, the price of pork in the northern Jiangsu production area has risen, and the pacification tax has increased by 80%. Therefore, if the current price is followed, the source of supply may be affected. At the same time, Nanjing, because it is closer to the production area, the pigs sold on August 19 were transported from the production area to Nanjing on August 14 and 15. Therefore, the price of pork in Nanjing on August 19 was based on the price of August 14 and 15 in the production area, which was higher than that in Shanghai. The wholesale price of pork in Nanjing on August 19 was 5.4 jia per jin. The Social Affairs Bureau has submitted the above situation to the Economic Supervision Officer's Office for review.

### Anonymous Citizen Visits Mayor, Donates Gold Bars as Special Contribution

### Supply Bureau's New Retail Store Overcrowded, "Scalpers" Break Twelve Pieces of Glass in Rush to Buy

[Our Report] The retail store of the Materials Supply Bureau opened yesterday on the ground floor of the Wing On Company's new building. Because the prices of general daily necessities were lower than those on the market, it became a target for scalpers. Starting at six in the morning, scalpers gathered at the entrance of Seven Heavens. Afterwards, more and more people arrived. By the time the retail store opened at around ten o'clock, nearly a thousand people had gathered outside, among whom were ordinary citizens, but the large-scale scalper contingent was clearly visible. When the iron gate opened, the crowd rushed in, and the retail store was instantly filled to the brim. Canned food, cosmetics, fabrics, and other items with particularly cheap prices were swept away. Although the Materials Supply Bureau stipulates that each person is limited to two items of each kind, scalpers adopted a cooperative method: one person buys the items and hands them to another person, who then repeatedly buys them a second and third time. They were particularly interested in canned peanuts, because the selling price was 300,000 per can, while the market price was 500,000. With one turn, each can could make a profit of 200,000. Therefore, most of them carried more than a dozen cans in their hands when they left. When the crowd squeezed to buy, the noise was chaotic, and the order was disordered. Twelve pieces of glass on the counter were broken, and transactions reached a point where they could not proceed. At this time, there were still as many customers rushing in on the road as there were villagers crossing the river, so they urgently called the police bureau to temporarily send more than 50 police officers in a police vehicle to the scene to maintain order and pulled down the iron gate, allowing only people to exit and not enter. At around eleven o'clock, the retail store decided to close and temporarily suspend business, and a sign was hung high at the door: "Various goods need to be urgently sorted. Please come early tomorrow to purchase goods." The surging crowd gradually dispersed. The method of selling today will be improved after discussion. In addition to strengthening guards to maintain order, customers will be allowed to enter in batches. For peanuts and other particularly cheap items, purchases must be made by queuing up in order from the other door. At the same time, the quantity of various items carried out by customers will be checked to prevent scalpers from buying up the goods. However, the fundamental reason for the rush to buy is that the selling price is lower than that on the market, so the Materials Supply Bureau may consider raising it.

### Journalists Celebrate Journalism Day by Holding Third General Meeting, Designating Annual Journalism Day as a Holiday

[Our Report] Shi Shaoji, a guard at the Fandeng Garden on South Shaanxi Road, introduced his friend Qian Bingjin to work as a head cook at the residence of a Westerner at 244 Yangjia Building, Hongqiao Road, last year.

### Tragedy at Hongkou Shooting Range: Abandoned Shell Explosion Kills and Injures Eight, Including Four Jinan University Students

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday at around 12:40 PM, a tragic incident occurred near the old site of the Hongkou Park shooting range at the end of North Sichuan Road, where an abandoned artillery shell exploded, killing and injuring eight people. The Naval Headquarters Shanghai Factory had taken possession of 3,531 abandoned 15mm mortar shells left by the Japanese army after the war, and these were stored at the old shooting range site. Recently, the factory, seeking to utilize waste materials, entered into a contract with the Zhu Shi Dade Hing Dye Factory, under which the dye factory would extract the explosives from these abandoned shells, the scrap iron would be used for other purposes by the Navy Shanghai Factory, and the explosives would belong to the Dade Hing Factory, with the picric acid component being used to manufacture dyes. Starting from August 16, the factory set up a boiler at the storage site to heat the shells with steam, having already processed 195 shells. Yesterday, another 76 shells were being processed. Before the incident, the old steward of the factory, Bai Fanglong, who was responsible for guarding the boiler, left for lunch and handed over the watch to a young worker named Jin Rentai. Not long after, the boiler and the shells exploded simultaneously with a loud noise. The cause may have been due to the young worker's negligence, causing the boiler temperature to exceed 200 degrees. During the explosion, shell fragments flew in all directions, killing Jin Rentai and another worker on the spot, and injuring four students from Jinan University and two passersby. The dead were later buried, and the injured were sent to the Municipal Fourth Hospital for treatment. Tang Xingcun, the manager of Dade Hing Dye Factory, has been taken to the police station for interrogation.

### Xu Jizhuang's Extradition Nears, Final Trial Scheduled

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Hong Kong Central Court has investigated the Xu Jizhuang corruption case several times, but no decision has yet been reached on the issue of Xu's extradition. Xian Bingxi, the lawyer representing our country in Hong Kong, telegraphed to Chief Judge Cha of the Shanghai District Court, reporting that the Hong Kong Central Court is scheduled to conduct the final trial of the Xu case on the 21st, 22nd, and 27th of this month. Although the hearing dates are relatively long, according to British and American law, the defendant must be given ample opportunity to defend himself. The Hong Kong side now recognizes that Xu has committed acts of corruption, which is quite beneficial to our request for extradition. If Xu fails to provide sufficient reasons for his defense in this final trial, there should be no problem with our country's extradition request. The telegram also stated that the Hong Kong government has approved our District Court's request, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to send a copy of the Xu case investigation record to Shanghai in the coming days for reference. Our side has now dispatched a reliable police officer to Hong Kong in advance to proceed with Xu's extradition procedures.

### Japanese War Criminal Matsutani, Who Committed Many Evils in Fengjing During the War, Was Executed by Firing Squad Yesterday; Before Execution, He Took a Bath, Wrote a Will, and Cut His Hair and Nails to Send to His Relatives

[Report from Our Newspaper] Japanese war criminal Matsutani Yoshimori, 30 years old, from Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan, served as a sergeant staff member in the Japanese Army Hangzhou Songjiang Dispatch Unit during the war. Stationed in Guanjing Town, he also served as a guidance officer for the puppet organization, specializing in extorting grain from the jurisdiction, killing civilians, and disturbing the local people. On the 11th day of the second lunar month of the 34th year of the Republic of China, Xu Alai, a resident of Qianda Popu Village, was carrying five dou of grain from a neighboring village, shouldering it to return home, when he encountered Matsutani, who was going to the countryside to extort grain. Matsutani falsely accused Xu of being a rice dealer, severely beat him, and detained him at the Fengjing puppet police station. Two months later, Xu was taken to an open space south of the Catholic Church in the suburbs of Fengjing Town, where Matsutani stabbed him nine times in the back and abdomen with a military sword, followed by beheading. On March 20 of the same year, Matsutani led plainclothes soldiers to the home of Mei Xingsong in Jiangjiabang, claiming to be searching for underground workers. He set fire to the 18 rooms of Jiang's house and used weapons to prevent anyone from helping to extinguish the fire. On the morning of April 11 of the same year, Matsutani led more than ten plainclothes Japanese soldiers to the home of Zhang Xingming in Huangnibang, Yixiang, intending to extort grain. Zhang Xingming saw them coming from afar and, knowing they were up to no good, immediately locked the gate and hid outside to observe the situation. When Matsutani and his men arrived, they broke into the house after seeing the gate locked. Moments later, flames suddenly burst through the roof, and within three hours, the entire house was reduced to ashes. On the same day, Matsutani went to the home of Wang Yueqi, the deputy chief of Jiexu Township, and extorted more than ten dan of food rice. He then went to the home of Wang Zhou and extorted more than twenty dan of food rice, without paying any price or issuing any receipts. In April of the same year, Matsutani went to Tangnipo, Yangziwei, Fenglin Township, and attempted to extort grain but failed. He then set fire to all the houses in the village, with only three families spared. After the victory, local citizens, including Ling Jingxing, reported and detained him. Shi Meiyu, the presiding judge of the War Criminals Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense, conducted a thorough trial. Based on conclusive evidence, he sentenced Matsutani to death and submitted the verdict to President Chiang for approval, ordering its execution. At 11:00 AM yesterday, Prosecutor Shi Yong, accompanied by Clerk Guo Zhenji, Interpreter Wang Renming, and a squad of armed military police, went to the Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison and brought Matsutani out of prison. Knowing that his end was near, Matsutani requested permission to take a bath and change his clothes. He then put on his military uniform, long leather boots, and a white collared shirt, and went out with them. He was tall and handsome, wearing tortoise-shell rimmed glasses and had well-groomed hair. The public trial was temporarily set up in the First Tribunal of the Special Criminal Court. After the court opened and the prosecutor announced the execution, Matsutani immediately requested to write three wills: one to bid farewell to his family, one to the 300 inmates in Jiangwan, and another to his beloved subordinate, Kutsuchi Kuniji. After writing, he cut off a small amount of his nails and hair in court, along with a pen, and placed them in an envelope, writing that they should be handed over to Gangcun Ningji to be forwarded to his relatives in Japan. At this point, the prosecutor announced the adjournment of the court, and Matsutani was escorted to the execution ground. Matsutani was still singing loudly when the shot rang out and he fell into a pool of blood. The time was precisely 12:45 PM. The body of the condemned was immediately buried.

### Record of the Re-Laying and Opening of the Jiangnan Railway's Nanjing-Wuhu Section

— Special Correspondent of Our Newspaper, Kang Feng

[Quick Report from Our Newspaper, Wuhu, 30th] Mr. Zhang Jingjiang, a retired revolutionary elder who is engaged in industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises, has never forgotten the re-laying and opening of the Jiangnan Railway, which he sponsored. At the beginning of July, the steel rails and accessories purchased by the Jiangnan Railway Company in the United States arrived in Shanghai, followed immediately by the arrival of the sleepers purchased in Canada. Zhou Jinsong, the acting general manager of the company, also flew from the United States to Shanghai. In order to accelerate the establishment of Jiangnan's overall war preparedness, the company decided to open the Nanjing-Wuhu section to traffic within 50 days.

On July 12, track laying began at the Zhonghuamen Station in Nanjing. Prior to this, the Ministry of Transportation had ordered the two railway bureaus to prioritize the transport of the "Jiangnan" steel rails and sleepers to Nanjing. The Ministry of Transportation provided assistance in many other matters as well. On July 12, the 75-pound steel rails were laid one by one on the roadbed of the Nanjing-Wuhu section, from which the steel rails had been removed two and a half years ago. The fishplates were installed, the bolts were tightened, the first group of track-laying workers moved forward, and the second group of track-lifting workers came to place the sleepers under the laid steel rails and nail them in place with spikes.

Two Kilometers a Day

In this way, two kilometers a day, the track-laying team, under the direction of a construction train made up of three freight cars, came from Nanjing to Wuhu. They passed Jiangning Town, Tongjing, Cihu, and entered the territory of Dangtu County in Anhui Province, passing through Caishi, Ma'anshan, Dangtu, and Daqiao, finally arriving at the Wuhu riverside station on August 27. The time was exactly within 50 days.

During the 45 days of intense work, the employees of the track-laying team, from the chief engineer Wang Yuchen, the team leader, to the workers who used the adze and iron hammer to lift the rails and drive in the spikes, were all tanned black. Fortunately, the route was flat, it was a re-laid old base, and the bridge engineering had been completed early, so the track-laying progressed smoothly. A dozen or so people who had their skin and bones broken by sleepers, steel rails, and crushed stones were immediately bandaged by Dr. Yin, who accompanied the train, with bone-setting medicine.

In the short 90 kilometers of the Nanjing-Wuhu section of the main line and the 10 kilometers of the side line, 1,540 sleepers were used per kilometer, for a total of more than 150,000 sleepers. 7,300 tons of 75-pound steel rails purchased in the United States were used. Because this was not enough, 700 tons of 60-pound steel rails that were previously stored on the route were also collected, and a total of 9,000 tons of steel products, such as fast fishplates and spikes, were laid. Other tasks, such as the erection of telephone lines along the line, the installation of electric lights at the Nanjing and Wuhu stations, the repair of station buildings, and the renovation of platforms, were all underway. In order to strengthen the roadbed, stones were quarried at Tongjing Station to fill in the thinner sections of the roadbed.

Less Than 700 People

These projects, under the personal direction of Zhou Xianjun and the leadership of Wang Yuchen, were completed by fewer than 700 people, including more than 40 management employees, 300 track-laying workers, 150 track-lifting and sleeper-laying workers, and more than 160 workers in Nanjing Zhonghuamen who loaded materials onto the train and supplied them forward! In 45 days, the work of re-laying 100 kilometers of the main and side lines was completed! On August 27, the workers' shed arrived at the Wuhu riverside station. The workers were sorting out the last section in the dim light of the waning moon. The green tents stretched out like military camps. In the second half of the night, they lay down to sleep inside, their tired bodies exhausted. In the summer night, the fragrance of fireflies and rice paddies blew in the night wind, caressing their dark, oily bodies. Although it was not the vitamin-rich fragrance that directly nourished them, it was also a silent welcoming gift from the countryside of Jiangnan in August's autumn harvest to the laborers from the city!

Everything has to be done quickly, this is the modern entrepreneurial spirit! At 8:00 AM and 4:30 PM on August 28, a passenger car of no particular class departed from Wuhu and Nanjing, respectively. On this day, travelers traveling on the Nanjing-Wuhu line exchanged a low price of 1.5 yuan for a smooth train journey. They no longer had to worry about breaking down, nor did they have to worry that their lives would be thrown into the underworld due to an occasional oversight by the driver. The travelers smelled the fragrance of the autumn harvest rice paddies in Jiangnan and watched the picturesque harvest scenes, with white geese and yellow chickens nimbly pecking in the ponds and fields, as if they had returned to the quiet life before the war.

Wang Yuzan, the head of the Transportation Section, said that their transportation forecast for these two months, September and October, is to supply 3,000 to 4,000 passengers per day. After two months, when everything is normal, they hope to increase the ticket sales volume to 5,000 passengers per day (i.e., supplying 1.8 million travelers per year). In terms of freight transport, the expected outbound goods are agricultural products such as rice, rapeseed, and goose and duck feathers, at approximately 300 tons per day, with an annual transport volume of 110,000 tons. The inbound goods are Huainan coal for the Wuhu Electric Light Company and Huai salt, general merchandise, cloth, cotton yarn, etc., at approximately 100 tons per day, or 3,000 tons per month. Currently, they are negotiating with the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway on matters related to joint transportation for both passenger and freight transport. The Yao Huamen Station of the two railway bureaus before the war had a joint transportation line connecting to the Zhonghuamen Station of the Jiangnan Railway. Now that the re-laying is complete, the agricultural products of southern Anhui can be loaded in Wuhu and transported directly to Shanghai. Industrial products for domestic sales from Shanghai also do not need to be unloaded in Nanjing before arriving in Wuhu.

It's Just the Beginning

These completed and soon-to-be-completed projects are just the beginning. Currently, the tracks have been re-laid, and there are 12 locomotives that can be used for traffic, 19 newly purchased American-made steel-skinned passenger cars, 7 freight cars converted into third-class cars, 6 old passenger cars newly refitted, and freight cars can be supplied without shortage after freight transport is launched. Zhou Xiansong, the acting general manager, talked about the founder of this railway, Mr. Zhang Jingjiang. Although he is nearly completely blind, the old gentleman sees that China is bright, and many emerging industries will replace the tragic situation of bloody battles. This old gentleman wants his business to benefit the people's livelihood and the national economy, and he wants his business to create batches of young people who can renew feudal China. Even if his eyes cannot see the light, his heart has a bright view in sight!

The Third Good News

During the war, this railway had already been opened to traffic to Sunjiabu in Xuancheng, and the track laying had passed through the mountainous area of Huizhou in southern Anhui and reached Jingdezhen, the porcelain capital of Jiangxi, and was about to connect with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway at Yingtan Station. The Anti-Japanese War dismantled the repaired Huizhou area railway, and the Nanjing-Wuhu-Xuancheng section fell into enemy hands. Less than three months after the victory, this 60-pound light rail was dismantled for the needs of other railways, leaving the Nanjing-Wuhu section reliant on small ferries and bumpy trucks for connection. Now, with the autumn harvest and the advent of the gold yuan as the first two pieces of good news, the re-laying of the Jiangnan Railway to Wuhu is truly the third piece of good news for travelers!

### Surveying Jiaozuo, the Coal Capital, from a New Perspective (Conclusion)

— Special Correspondent of Our Newspaper, Ling Songshou

[Quick Report from Our Newspaper, Jiaozuo, 28th] In the afternoon of that day, Director Li accompanied me down the mine. I put on the blue cloth worker's uniform, wore the "wicker hat" woven from rattan, and took a cane and flashlight, and went down 500 feet deep into the ground.

This is the world of coal, the dim electric lights emitting light with uncertain strength. We walked along the main passageway, heading southwest. Coal cars slid along the tracks, passing by our side. The height and width of the passageway were standard: nine feet high and eleven feet wide. But some places were very low, so you had to lower your head to pass. Sometimes, because I was preoccupied with talking, I didn't pay attention, so I bumped my head more than ten times. The layout of this mine uses the room and pillar method. A coal pillar is left every 100 meters square. Along both sides of the passageway, every 100 meters, tunnels are drilled to the left and right for mining. The passageway is supported by wooden pillars, one on each side and one above. The distance between them depends on the quality of the coal and the top pressure, averaging about 40 centimeters. Wooden pillars are the soul of the entire mine. Without them, production is impossible, and if the calculation is inaccurate or there is slight negligence during the pillar support, it affects the lives of thousands of miners. Currently, the need for wooden pillars is also one of the most difficult problems for the mine. According to general calculations, six wooden segments (i.e., two sets) are needed for every ten tons of coal produced, and the trees near Jiaozuo were cut down long ago due to wartime military and railway needs. Recently, the mine has purchased them at high prices, stipulating that five wooden segments can be exchanged for one ton of coal, but the source of wooden segments is still limited, so the mine can only dismantle the pillars of less important coal tunnels to meet the current need. The pillars that support the coal seam are commonly known as "sheds" in the mine. It is one of the most closely watched items in mining. There are dedicated people responsible for checking it every day. Because the upper coal seam gradually presses down, the unstable coal seam can easily drop pieces of coal, which may collapse the shed. The reporter saw in several places that there were large gaps above the beams and pillars, which were filled with wooden segments. This is the kind of work they do.

The main passageway of Wangfeng Mine runs about 400 feet northeast and about 4,000 feet southwest. We walked about 1,700 feet southwest along the slope of the coal seam, at an inclination of about 10 degrees, and then turned southwest again, at an inclination angle of 15 degrees, to the mining area. There are very few electric lights in this section. Coal workers live in coal piles all year round. They cannot see the sunlight, but they bring infinite light and heat to people underground.

Because the traffic is suffocated, limiting the production of coal, no new tunnels are being opened in the mine now. Only

Old Tunnels Are Being Mined

is enough to meet the current need. The main tools for mining are iron drills and explosives. After the coal is blasted down, it is pushed from the rails to the pit mouth in "yuanbao cars" that transport coal, and then hoisted by a winding machine to the coal plant. In places with particularly steep slopes, the coal cars are towed by electric winches.

The treatment of water leaking into the mine from the cracks in the rock layer is also an important task in mining. The day I went down the mine, it rained heavily overnight, so there was particularly a lot of water in the mine. When I went down the mine, the sound of dripping water from the four walls was like heavy rain. The water accumulated on both sides of the railway tracks in the mine was several inches deep, flowing towards the water pool in the original room. The electric motor in the original room was working non-stop, and it could pump away five tons of accumulated water per minute, so there was no problem in dealing with some accumulated water.

After staying in the mine for 50 minutes, I also returned to the ground with a face full of coal. Near the mine there is also an electric sorting machine, which is not used now because of the low output. In order to save expenses, the coal sorting work is not done by workers, but by Director Li Fazong leading all the employees to do agricultural labor. A light rail track is laid under the coal sorting machine, which is connected to the Xin-Jiao Railway. It is very convenient to transport coal in normal times. After the Xin-Jiao line was cut off, the branch line for transporting coal has also been idle until now. The rails are rusty, and piles of green grass grow between the sleepers.

Currently, the Jiaozuo Mine produces 100 to 200 tons of coal per day. Part of it is consumed by the mine itself, turning into power, and part of it is used to meet external needs. In Jiaozuo, various institutions, water, electricity, and coal, must be supplied by Zhongfu Company unconditionally. This consumption requires more than 4,000 tons of coal per month. The remaining dozens to hundreds of tons are only used to supply retailers, who transport them to Xinxiang for sale by trucks or human power.

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to sources from the Export Control Commission, the export of tung oil from our country in the past few weeks has been declining due to the competitive sales of exporters and the price suppression of foreign importers. The New York market price has fallen to as low as 18 cents per pound. After the currency system reform, the relevant authorities implemented export price limit measures to prevent merchants from competing to sell at low prices and causing a continued decline in overseas prices. It is now known that the New York market price of tung oil has risen to over 20 cents per pound.

Another report: The domestic sales season for tung oil has passed, and the market has been extremely sluggish recently. The prospects for foreign sales are now optimistic. It is heard that since the currency system reform, various export firms stationed in Hankou have been absorbing large quantities. In the past few days, 5,000 to 6,000 dan have been traded daily, and the estimated total has been no less than 30,000 dan. The current oil price in Hankou is 68.8 yuan per dan, plus exchange fees and transportation costs, the cost to Shanghai is about 76 yuan. The oil price in Hangzhou is 73.5 yuan, plus transportation costs to Shanghai and loss and consumption, which is similar to the price in Hankou. If calculated based on the export price limit of 20 cents C.R.F. per pound and 18 cents F.O.B., a large export volume can be expected.

### North and South City Counterfeit Education Intermingling; Rice Price Fluctuations Minimal

Flour Trading Temporarily Suspended; Oil Market Stable

In yesterday's rice market, the northern city (北市) was slightly firmer while the southern city (南市) was somewhat weaker, reversing the previous day's situation. In the northern city, due to lower prices the day before, rice shops went there to purchase, leading to brisk sales and price increases. Superior white japonica and high-quality thin indica rice rose slightly by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan, while mid-grade and lower-quality rice increased by 0.40 to 0.50 yuan. Sales of new japonica rice were sluggish, with only mid-grade and lower-quality rice rising by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan. The market in the southern city started similarly to the previous day, but shops bought less, resulting in sluggish sales, and prices fell slightly by closing. Thick and thin indica rice both declined by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan, while white yuan rice remained stable. Yesterday, a total of 3,178 shi (石) of rice arrived in the northern and southern cities combined.

Flour

Due to restrictions imposed by the Bureau of Social Affairs on old warehouse receipts (老棧單), trading has been suspended from today. Deliveries are limited to within seven days, but industry members felt the deadline was too short to meet. Yesterday, a special extraordinary general meeting was convened, resolving to request an extension of the deadline. Meanwhile, members were asked to first register their warehouse receipts. As a result, no trading took place. Reportedly, the asking price for "warship flour" (兵船粉) dropped to 6.50 yuan, while large bags of wheat bran opened at 5.25 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

Trading was generally conducted at the limited prices, but due to scarce supply, transactions were even more quiet. The price of soybeans from the production area was high, and most owners were reluctant to sell, resulting in few transactions. Only some broad beans (荼豆) were sold in the local market, with prices following the limited range. Broad bean prices did not fluctuate, and there was no supply of selected green beans. Corn from the Yantai region was being collected, with prices similar to the previous day, and trading was still active. Yuan wheat saw few transactions, with average sales and stable prices. Only some sesame was sold in the local market, with transactions at limited prices. Restrictions were imposed on the re-export of shelled peanuts (生仁), so Guang-based merchants (廣帮) did not purchase, resulting in no trading and stable prices.

Edible Oil

Warehouse receipt goods, bean and rapeseed oil were stable to weak. With the impending ban on warehouse receipt trading, holders were very willing to sell, continuing to offer their goods. Bean and rapeseed oil were initially firm but weakened later, resulting in prices similar to the previous day, showing a stable to weak trend. Raw oil (生油) was firm, with refined raw oil (凈生油) pegged at the limited price, and few offers being made. There was no supply of small cart sesame oil (小車蔴油), resulting in no trading. The bean cake market was firm and rising, with all brands pegged at the limited price.

### Money Market Remains Very Loose; Slight Clearing Differences Among Banks

Yesterday, the money market in this city remained very loose. The four banks (四行), two bureaus (二局), and one treasury (一庫) experienced slight clearing differences in bills and notes among the silver and money businesses, totaling 1.8 million yuan.

Customers approved for registration by the company can go to the company between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM on the same day to participate in the lowest price bidding, it is said.

### Illegal Use of Loan Funds

Lending Banks Should Bear Joint and Several Liability

The Provisional Rules for Interbank Rediscounting and Reloaning by the Central Bank have been approved by the Joint Board of Four Banks (四聯總處). According to a Central Bank official, the main purpose of these Provisional Rules is to support the government's emergency handling of financial and economic matters, improve interbank lending operations, control interest rates, support production, and encourage the circulation of daily necessities and export goods. The total amount of loans for which banks apply for rediscounting, relicensing, or export financing should not exceed the paid-up capital and the average total deposit amount of the previous month. The loan targets are also stricter than in the past, and the original loan interest rate is limited to no more than 3% per month. Rediscounting and relicensing may be handled at 60% to 80% of the original loan interest rate, and the discount for rediscounting and relicensing is 70% to 90% of the original loan amount. If it is found that loan manufacturers are using funds for non-productive purposes or hoarding for speculation, the lending bank shall bear joint and several liability. The above are the important meanings of this revision of the interbank rediscounting rules.

### National Banks Must Also Deposit 100% Reserves for Developing Bank Notes

[This newspaper report] It is reported that the six national banks in this city, including the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China, previously applied for exemption from the restriction that the outstanding balance of bank notes on the same day must have 100% reserves deposited with the Central Bank or the clearing house when issuing bank notes. This matter was referred by the Shanghai Financial Control Bureau to the Ministry of Finance, which instructed that no exceptions should be made. The Bureau has now ordered all relevant banks to comply.

### Interest on Deposit Reserves Reduced to 2% Per Month

The Central Bank continues to handle bank deposit reserves in accordance with the Banking Law, charging 15% for current deposits and 10% for fixed deposits. The interest rate has been reduced to 2% per month.

The National Bank Inspection Office (國行稽該處) recently issued a comparative table of the total amount of deposits and reserves of banks nationwide in August, as follows: current deposits 23,187,339,795,771.10 yuan, fixed deposits 4,339,825,484,929.62 yuan, total deposits 27,527,165,280,690.92 yuan, paid reserves 31,815,448,931,823.35 yuan.

### Timber Market Conditions Turn Firmer

Timber market conditions remain stable and uneventful, but market sentiment is firmer than before. For example, top-grade fir wood strips (杉木條子) are not being sold at 0.12 yuan, and only lower-grade goods are still available on the market. It is reported that the production cost of fir wood in Fujian is still high. The cost of special fir wood strips delivered to Shanghai is 0.17 yuan, while the selling price in Shanghai is only 0.14 to 0.15 yuan.

### Cotton Yarn Trading Becomes Active; Cloth Trading Remains Stagnant

Yesterday, trading in the cotton yarn market became active. Due to the loose money supply in the market, although the Textile Construction Company (紡建公司) opened sales, replicating merchants and visiting merchants (客帮) had an appetite for goods. Market prices were all traded at the limited price. The association is currently requesting the authorities to inform the Textile Construction Company and private yarn factories to increase supply and adjust legal profits. Market sentiment has therefore eased. Yesterday, 22 types of coarse and fine yarn were traded, totaling 43.5 pieces. Also reported: The Textile Construction Company continued to open sales of four types of coarse yarn. 10-count Fugui (富貴) was priced at 490 yuan, 16-count Three Sheep (三羊) was priced at 585 yuan, and 20-count Golden Double Chicken Running (金雙鷄·奔騰) was priced at 645 yuan each. Each household was limited to purchasing one piece, so applications were very enthusiastic.

The cotton cloth market remains stagnant. Most market prices have reached the price increase limit, and trading has automatically suspended. However, a few brokers are trying to find low-grade assorted fine cloth, but ultimately there are no sellers, so no transactions can be made. Occasionally, due to actual needs, people are willing to exchange Four Gentlemen Yuan Beaverteen (四君子元嗶嘰) plus one yuan for Dragon Head Fine Cloth (龍頭細布).

Also reported, the various cloths supplied for sale by the Textile Construction Company two days ago were mostly drawn by lot. For example, Yanghe B-character Fine Cloth (陽鶴Ｂ字細布), Jumping Carp Navy Beaverteen (跳鯉藏靑嗶嘰), Playing Umbrella Bleached Cloth (玩傘漂布), and Da Ling Special Lotus Girl (大另特荷花女), etc. Each household could receive one piece of each type, so the market supply was insufficient. Also reported: Cloth wholesalers such as Xinda Xiang and Bao Da Xiang are selling Dragon Head Fine Cloth at 29.5 yuan and Four Gentlemen Yuan Beaverteen at 28.5 yuan, supplying according to the limit, but must cut open the package to prevent abuse.

Also reported: Zhong Textile (中紡) customarily sold 13 types of yarn, totaling 1,420 pieces, with a total value of 1,347,103 yuan. Starting September 3rd, China Textile's cotton yarn registration (for replicating factories) will change to 9:30 AM, with purchase applications closing at 10:30 AM. Also, starting September 2nd, cotton cloth will be listed earlier at 10:00 AM, with orders closing at 11:00 AM.

### Supervisory Council for Issuance Regularly Announces the Gold Yuan Issuance Reserves and Figures

For this currency reform, the reserves for issuing Gold Yuan (金圓券) notes are extremely sufficient. In order to show great credibility to the people, the government has established an Issuance Supervisory Council, responsible for supervision and inspection. The Council has been formally established and has begun to perform its duties. The Council has already dispatched personnel to inspect and verify the cash reserve of US$200 million and the guarantee reserve of US$300 million. The cash reserve includes gold, silver, and foreign currencies. The guarantee reserve is the assets of state-owned enterprises, and detailed lists have been prepared separately. The Council's inspection work is carried out by members rotating each month, with Committee Member Xu Jiqing (徐委員寄廎) for August. Committee Member Xu has already inspected and verified the preparatory matters for the August inspection and the issuance figures before August 31st, and will hold a committee meeting this Saturday (4th) to report the inspection situation and the government's issuance figures to the conference, and formally announce them to the people. Also, regarding the guarantee reserve, the government is actively selling state-owned enterprises and is simultaneously organizing companies to issue stocks. 50% of the stocks sold will be used to supplement the guarantee reserve.

### Two Batches of Cotton Yarn Sold to Burma Set Sail

The Foreign Sales Committee for Textile Products handled 20,000 pieces of cotton yarn to be shipped to Burma. The first batch of 4,000 pieces has already set sail. The second batch of 4,000 pieces has been loaded onto the China Merchants Bureau’s Deng Yu (登禹) ship, bound for Burma. The ship is scheduled to clear customs yesterday, and will set sail as soon as possible. Also, the cotton needed for the 20,000 pieces of cotton yarn cannot be purchased yet, and the Foreign Sales Committee plans to temporarily borrow a portion from the second phase of the American Aid cotton from the American Aid Association for use, and in the future, the foreign exchange earned from the batch of cotton yarn will be used to purchase the same amount of cotton to repay.

### National Banks Temporarily Suspend New Loans

### Commercial Briefs

The Brick, Tile, Cement, and Sundry Materials Commercial Association of this city has submitted the prices of the 19th of last month to the competent authorities for approval, and has prepared two kinds of printed price lists for the industry's purchase prices and retail prices, which were distributed to the industry yesterday for compliance and trade at the limited prices.

The Steel, Copper, Tin, and Hardware Associations are still uncertain about the limited prices for the industry. The four industry associations may hold a joint meeting to discuss and agree on them to avoid discrepancies.

The Egg Industry Association believes that egg prices have been affected by the "August 19" price limits in recent days, so formal transactions cannot be carried out, and the agreement between the Association and the Bureau of Social Affairs has not yet been reached. The Industry Association held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss everything.

It is reported that members of the Shanghai National Paint and Sundry Goods Commercial Association, who operate commodities such as lithopone, zinc oxide, massicot, red lead, lead powder, and ink ash, have their selling prices set and distributed to each store by the Association. There is no tea party setting in the market, and no brokers are involved. However, the dye industry has tea parties in places like Qinglian Pavilion and Yijia Chun in this city, it is said.

### Dunhuang Art

— Bai Yong

The National Dunhuang Art Research Institute held an exhibition at the Central Research Institute in Nanjing from August 24th to 29th, featuring complete reproductions of the murals from the Mogao Caves of Dunhuang. The exhibits were divided into categories such as photography, selected representative works of murals from various dynasties, patterns of caissons, floral borders, and Buddha halos from various dynasties, lotus pedestals from various dynasties, and historical materials related to customs, including musical performances, landscapes, figures, boats, vehicles, architecture, clothing, animals, and apsaras. There were no fewer than a thousand items on display. In particular, the reproductions of the murals were so accurate in color and shape that they were indistinguishable from the originals, almost making us feel as if we were in the Mogao Grottoes. They were vastly superior to those who only depict a fragment and then boast of novelty.

From the Northern Wei Dynasty to the end of the Tang Dynasty, Dunhuang was an international city in northwestern China. Reading Mr. Xiang Da's book "Chang'an and Western Civilization in the Tang Dynasty" will provide detailed information. It has been determined that the Li Tang ethnicity was a foreign tribe from the northwest, but they were already heavily sinicized. However, they did not reject the Hu people (non-Han) as much as previous dynasties. Many of the ministers who made great contributions during the early Tang Dynasty were foreigners (Yuchi Jingde is the most famous, originating from the Northern Wei Dynasty, with his ancestor being from Yuqi in the Western Regions). Therefore, several major cities in China at that time were areas where foreigners gathered, such as Guangzhou and Yangzhou, which were residences for Hu people who came to China by sea, and Luoyang and Chang'an, which were inhabited by Hu people from the West. Dunhuang was the boundary between China and the Western Regions, so many foreigners came to reside there. On one hand, they admired Chinese culture, and on the other hand, they also spread Hu customs to China. Tang Dynasty music, dance, clothing, games, and food were all influenced by Hu customs, similar to how the upper class in our country today values Westernization. The more prominent the officials and nobles, the deeper the Hu influence. We generally believe that the Tang Dynasty was the most prosperous period for Chinese culture and education, but we do not know that foreign culture was on par with China at that time. Now, looking at the foreign princes, foreignized Buddha statues, and various musical performances in the Dunhuang murals, we gain a deeper understanding of the Hu customs of that time. As for the Buddha statues, their composition, clothing, etc., are nothing like the rigid ones of today. The proportions and facial features of the whole body are very similar to the models painted by Western painters today, giving us a sense of humanity rather than absurd superstition. In the beautiful harmony, the supreme perfection is revealed, and the solemn and wonderful appearance mentioned in the scriptures is truly protected.

The paintings of the Wei, Sui, and early Tang dynasties are full of majestic spirit. For example, there are two types of Buddha stories, one called "Bodhisattva Sacrifices Himself to Feed a Hungry Tiger" and the other called "The Story of the Five Hundred Robbers." The former is well known to everyone. The latter tells the story of five hundred robbers who were arrested and subjected to eye gouging. Later, they converted to Buddhism and regained their sight. These two continuous story paintings, with their rough lines and bold composition, everywhere show the characteristics of early folk art, unlike the weak and lifeless paintings drawn by painters or artisans since the Ming and Qing dynasties, which are simply like corpses with their eyes open. This comic strip style should really be used by today's artists. The Chinese nation is too old, and its blood and physique have become stagnant and decayed. It must be infused with new blood cells to be revived. Rather than peddling from Europe and the United States, it is better to seek from our ancestors. I think that the above-mentioned continuous story paintings gradually became petty and powerless after the Song Dynasty. The Buddha's renunciation story painted by the Song people is a small picture, lacking courage and spirit, far inferior to the continuous painting methods of the Sui and Tang dynasties, and the brushstrokes cannot be compared. The Western Xia Buddha paintings contemporaneous with the Song Dynasty seem to be slightly better, and their caisson patterns are no less impressive than those of the Sui and Tang Dynasties, showing how different the spirit of a rising nation is from that of a declining one. This cannot help but make us think of other departments from art.

The art and documents of Dunhuang have become famous in the world due to the exaggeration of foreigners such as Pelliot and Stein. It is a pity that Chinese archaeologists did not realize that there was such a treasure trove in the Western Regions until Pelliot held an exhibition of the treasures he had looted at the Six Nations Hotel in Beijing and boasted about it. But 50 or 60 years ago, Stein had already printed The Thousand Buddhas, and Pelliot had also printed extremely exquisite Dunhuang illustrations. Even the Oriental Culture Research Institute of Japan has printed a "Study of Dunhuang Paintings." The books by Pelliot and Stein are extremely exquisite and more valuable than gold. The Japanese one also has more than 800 pages and more than 400 illustrations, which cannot but make us feel ashamed. Now, trying to use the achievements of the Dunhuang Research Institute as a basis to print a more perfect Dunhuang catalog, not only will it be enough to preserve countless national treasures, but it will also allow artists and archaeologists to increase countless materials. Private power is limited, and the government does not seem to be able to ignore it. Standing in the position of a reader, I am eagerly looking forward to its realization day and night.

Oak Ridge, hidden deep in the mountains of Tennessee, is one of the units of the American atomic bomb factory. It is heavily guarded, with the gate guarded by an armored vehicle controlled by the security police, which is connected to the central security headquarters and every "nerve center" in the isolated areas by wireless telephone.

This is the location of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, part of the nuclear research center. It consists of one hundred and fifty buildings. A small gray house stores the "atomic pile."

The so-called "atomic pile" is a graphite brick containing refined uranium ore. These graphite bricks are accumulated piece by piece, hence the name "atomic pile."

The Oak Ridge atomic pile is dedicated to producing radioactive materials for military, industrial, medical, and other experimental or practical uses. It contains more potential energy than the total energy of all the locomotives in the world, and the radiation emitted is equivalent to one million pounds of radium.

Oak Ridge's products are also shipped to Hanford, Washington, to produce Plutonium, and to Los Alamos to manufacture atomic bombs.

In Oak Ridge, atomic materials are manufactured in two different ways. One of them is undertaken by the "Electromagnetic Factory."

The Electromagnetic Factory is six miles away from the research center (all large units are isolated by mountains to reduce the risk of explosion). It is also known as the Y-12 factory, with a total of one hundred and seventy buildings, costing $400 million to build - more than the cost of opening the Panama Canal. During construction, because the United States was short of copper, it borrowed nearly $500 million worth of silver from the US Treasury to use as conductors. This silver is still there.

This unique factory in the world specializes in separating Uranium 235 from Uranium 238. It has thousands of complex machines, managed by thousands of male and female workers. However, each person manages only a simple small unit and is ignorant of the overall machine.

The hydropower plant here is also unparalleled in the world. Its power generation is twice that of the largest "Norris Dam" in the "Tennessee Valley Authority" (TVA).

On the other side of another mountain is the K-25 factory, which is a sister factory to the "Electromagnetic Factory." However, it does not use the electromagnetic method to manufacture atomic materials, but uses the gaseous distribution method. It has seventy buildings, of which the four-story main building is the largest single factory on Earth. This building is U-shaped, with wings one and a half miles long and 133 yards wide. Adjacent to it is a replica factory, but only a quarter of its size. Both units are filled with extremely precise machinery. Their purpose is to separate Uranium 235 from uranium compounds on a large scale.

In the Daang factory, uranium is first converted into a gas and then into a solid.

True atomic fission is achieved by forcing gas through thousands of incredibly fine screens. Each screen surface has billions of holes smaller than two millionths of a square inch.

The entire mechanism absolutely prevents the leakage of secrets. The detection equipment to prevent leakage is extremely thorough. If this equipment were installed in a large city, the central control room would be alerted if any doorbell rang, an elevator went up and down, a light went on or off, a telephone was used, or a window broke.

Oak Ridge is only one unit of the American atomic bomb factory. The vastness of its engineering and the meticulousness of its organization are already amazing; how complex and huge is the entire atomic bomb factory!

### Quirks

The French poet Baudelaire dyed his hair dark green, boasted of eating human flesh, and lived with snakes all day long.

The American painter Whistler always drew a butterfly when signing his paintings and private letters. He wore a white silk ribbon on his hair every day.

The German philosopher Spinoza often spent many hours capturing spiders and making them fight each other.

Bamboo Branch

Deep in the mountains and dense forests (bamboo branch) the sky is rarely seen (daughter), loves to sing clear songs (bamboo branch) tender eyebrows in the daytime (daughter), used to traveling between Baidi and Jiangling (bamboo branch) (daughter), why bother in life (bamboo branch) to write of long separation (daughter)!

Drunken Makeup Lyrics

Walking this way, walking that way, always in front of and behind people; walking that way, walking this way, not caring about her delicate steps.

For a long time, there has been no news from the horizon, inquiring, there is a small waist, about the wandering heartless person. True, true, true!

### Churchill on Wine

— Qing

In January 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill held the historically famous Casablanca Conference.

During the conference, one morning, Roosevelt sent his most trusted staff member, Hopkins, to contact Churchill. Hopkins was slightly surprised when he arrived at Churchill's residence!

It turned out that this great British Prime Minister had not yet gotten up. He was lying in bed in pink pajamas, eating something.

And Churchill's breakfast was a bottle of fine wine!

Hopkins couldn't help but ask Churchill what it meant to drink wine first thing in the morning.

Churchill replied that he had always had a strong aversion to milk, but he didn't hate a bottle of good wine. After careful consideration, he decided to drink wine. He said that he was sixty-eight years old and had always been healthy. Throughout his life, he felt that doctors' advice was often unreliable. He said that whether it was light wine or strong wine, he would never quit—now and in the future.

### Pi Cao Studies Monetary Exchange

Since the banks opened on the 22nd, two days after the government changed the currency on the 20th, the situation in the market can be generally described. People flocked to exchange gold, silver, and US dollars for the new currency, especially those who exchanged silver for new notes, which was the most crowded. Because the private market price of silver has always been much lower than that of silver dollars, this time the regulations suddenly made it higher than silver dollars (one tael of pure silver can be exchanged for three yuan in new notes, while one silver dollar can be exchanged for two yuan, almost the opposite of the ratio before the 20th), so those who hold silver were overjoyed. Although the exchange rate for silver dollars (6 million legal tender) is slightly less than the previous private market rate (between 7 and 8), the national bank's acceptance is not very picky about minor flaws, and many students and family members bought them a few months ago to meet urgent needs, waiting for the price to rise, so the official price at this time is more than three times higher than the private price when they bought them, so they are happy. The new official price of gold is also very favorable (200 new notes, 600 million legal tender, higher than the private price), so many people are selling them. As for the old currency (legal tender limited to 10,000 yuan, which is actually rare in the market, only "Lord Guan" is still numerous), the exchange is slower, first, the exchange period is longer (three months), second, the small denomination auxiliary coins of the new currency have not yet appeared, and third, the prices of goods have not changed much, so it is more convenient to use. For example, a piece of tofu costs 100,000, but if it is marked in new currency, there will be an endless decimal of "0.3333..." under "3 cents". If the new small notes are issued, or according to the "5 in, 4 abandon 1" rule, it must be reduced to 90,000 a piece, but the merchant's mentality is to expect it to advance to "4 cents." Therefore, delaying the exchange of old currency and extending its period seems to be beneficial to both the government and the merchants. And although the old currency is worth little, the number is large, and keeping it to set off the identity of the new small notes is not without the subtle effect of "setting off the moon with clouds."

The public's interest in the new currency is due to being tired of the tedious and endless numbers for a long time, and suddenly seeing the prices of "a few cents" and "a few cents" again, there is a real impression of returning to the "good old days". Because from spring to summer, the price of ordinary transactions has also progressed from "10,000" to "100 million", and the trend will make "billion, trillion, and quadrillion" arise in series. After this reform, the word "billion" was first relegated to the cold palace, and "trillion" and "quadrillion" need not come out. And the prices marked on each item in the windows of foreign stores, many "circles," "circles," "circles," like reading astronomy to calculate the tonnage of the sun, are now all shortened, with fewer "zeros" and more decimal points, which can be called a refreshing change.

### Zhang Zixiang and Feng Chaoran

— Hu Yaguang

In the past, there was an apprentice in a barber shop on Baike Road in Shanghai who often sneaked into a painting mounting shop next door to look at paintings. When the boss asked, he searched everywhere and finally found him in the painting mounting shop. He dragged him back to the shop and beat him severely. But after a short time, he would relapse. Later, whenever he disappeared, he would simply go straight to the painting mounting shop, and it was always a sure thing. Do you know who this apprentice is? It is the now famous painter Feng Chaoran! At that time, Zhang Zixiang was also selling paintings in Shanghai and often went to this painting mounting shop. Every time he saw such a small apprentice looking at calligraphy and paintings, and looking so engrossed, he thought it was strange. He found out that he was an apprentice in the barber shop next door. One day, Zhang Zixiang asked him why he liked looking at paintings so much. Feng Chaoran replied with tears in his eyes that he really liked learning to paint, but his environment did not allow it. Zhang Zixiang asked him to bring what he usually wrote and drew to take a look. Feng Chaoran brought a large bundle of landscapes, flowers, figures, and ladies, all of which were quite decent. Zhang Zixiang was amazed and resolutely asked him to leave the barber shop and was willing to teach him to paint. Later, Chaoran not only painted very well, able to surpass his teacher, but also quite successful in calligraphy and inscriptions. This is thanks to Zhang Zixiang's efforts to promote the younger generation, but without Chaoran's outstanding talent and willingness to work hard, there would be no achievements today!
