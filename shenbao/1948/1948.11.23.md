### The Nationalist Army on the Eastern Front of Xuzhou Advances, Continuing to Capture Strongholds, Ready to Join Forces at Nianzhuang, Two Major Army Groups in Northern Anhui Close in on Suxian

[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 22nd] According to observers, the first phase of the Xuzhou Campaign has concluded. Currently, both sides are concentrating their main forces for the second decisive battle. The fighting in the eastern suburbs remains at a stalemate. The Huang Botao Army Group, which has been fiercely defending Nianzhuang for over ten days and nights, has not been relieved, but this has not significantly impacted the overall situation of the decisive phase. The northward advance of the two major army groups of Li Yannian and Huang Wei along the Xuzhou-Bengbu section can be seen as the prelude to our counter-encirclement of the Communists.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] The Qiu-Li Army Group, advancing eastward, continued to attack the Communists facing them on the 22nd. After fierce fighting until noon, they successively captured strongholds such as Dahuo Shenmiao, Xiaohuo Shenmiao, and Daxujia, continuing their eastward advance. They are now only thirty li away from the Huang Army Group and will soon formally join forces.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] On the 22nd, the Nationalist Huang Army Group firmly defended the area north of Dongdayuan, Nianzhuang, and west of Youjia Lake, including Dazhuang, Xiaozhuang, Dasongzhuang, Hehezhuang, Pengzhuangshao, and the arc-shaped area, repeatedly engaging in fierce combat with the remaining Communists.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 22nd] Military News: The army group advancing eastward from Xuzhou continued to capture strongholds such as Shaojialou, Songzhuang, and Wuyiao north and south of Daxujia on the 22nd. The fighting lasted until dawn, resulting in significant gains. The Huang Army Group, steadfastly defending Nianzhuang with extraordinary perseverance, repelled the Communists' thirteenth day and night of offensive on the 22nd.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] The Qiu-Li pursuit army groups on the eastern front are currently advancing eastward side by side along both sides of the Longhai Railway. At 11:00 AM on the 21st, the Li Army Group on the left flank, with the assistance of the air force and tanks, after three days and nights of fierce fighting, finally completely recaptured the stronghold of Maguzi (four li north of Daxujia), which was heavily defended by the Communists' 7th and 10th Columns. The reporter immediately traveled to Maguzi, the front line, by tank for inspection. Upon entering the village at 2:00 PM, it was found that all houses in the village, which had over three hundred households, were destroyed. Only an old woman of over seventy years old was seen in the entire village, and all chickens and dogs were gone. Corpses were scattered everywhere, a truly unbearable sight. The Communist artillery facing us from the Dahuo Shenmiao and Xiaohuo Shenmiao, two li away, were fiercely shelling our positions. The Nationalist artillery were returning fire, so shells were landing both in front and behind. Three shells landed next to the tank I was riding in. Our air force continued to heavily bomb the Communist army positions at Daxujia with 500-pound bombs. The artillery were concentrating their fire on the Communist positions. Black smoke filled the sky, and the noise was deafening. The reporter met General Li Mi in the village, who reported that the Communists had built three layers of fortifications outside Maguzi Village, with trenches as dense as spiderwebs, making it very difficult to capture. On the battlefield, which spanned over one hundred li east-west and seventy li north-south, both sides had fortified every village, so the Nationalist army had to fight for every inch of land and every village. The villages within the war zone were completely uninhabited. The Qiu Qingquan Army Group on the right flank recaptured Liuluji (three kilometers south of Daxujia) on the afternoon of the 21st. On the 22nd, the Nationalist army continued to advance eastward in victory.

[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 22nd] The two strong army groups of Li Yannian and Huang Wei, advancing northward from northern Anhui, have devised thorough countermeasures against the Communists attempting to hinder our actions. Our crack troops advancing towards the Suxian front are advancing towards Longwangmiao, south of Xisipo, on the 22nd. Senior military officials here have stated that it is not difficult to open the Xuzhou-Bengbu section of the northward advance and encirclement, nor will it take a long time. Furthermore, the Liu Communist 3rd and 9th Columns, originally based in Suxian, have since yesterday dispersed to both sides of the Jinpu Railway, with the apparent aim of threatening our army's flanks. One branch that fled eastward contacted our army near Lingbi, and the Communists suffered heavy casualties.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 22nd] The army groups advancing northward from northern Anhui continued to crush the Liu Communist's stubborn resistance along the way, crossed the Fei River, and entered Nanpingji, 45 li southwest of Suxian on the south bank of the Hui River, at noon on the 22nd. The army groups advancing northward from the Jinpu Line simultaneously closed in on Xisipo, southeast of Suxian. The two major army groups will be able to join forces at Suxian within days.

[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 22nd] The two sides are still at a stalemate between Renqiao and Suxian on the Jinpu Line. The Liu Bocheng and Zhang Taisheng units are gathering south of Suxian, intending to contain the northward advance of the Li Yannian Army Group. The Huang Wei Army Group, advancing north across the Wo River, is detouring west of Suxian to strike the Communists in the back. Once the four-sided deployment is complete, a large-scale encirclement and annihilation of the Communists at Suxian will be launched. The Communists who attacked Renqiao earlier were captured over a hundred, and interrogated in Bengbu. According to their confessions, the Communists used two brigades to advance southward in this battle, suffering over a thousand casualties.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] On the southern front, our Qiu Army Group advanced southeast from Liuji, south of the city, yesterday and surrounded the 28th Regiment of the Communist Chen Geng's 4th Column at Xushancun (13 kilometers south of Xuzhou). After fierce fighting until the evening, over 1,200 Communists were killed or wounded, and 136 were captured. The entire regiment was annihilated, and four machine guns and over two hundred rifles were seized.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 22nd] On the southern front, the two regiments of the Communist New 11th Column, the 94th and 96th, fiercely attacked our Cuizhuang position last night. One company of the defending army engaged in fierce fighting with the Communists until 1:00 AM on the 22nd. The Communists abandoned over a thousand corpses and fled south. 183 people, including the political commissar of the captured camp, were captured, along with 26 machine guns and over 260 rifles.

### The Garrison Army Launches a Northern Offensive, The Pingdong Troops Clear and Suppress the Area Along the Grand Canal, The Shou Army in Shangyi, Chabei Withdraws, and the National Army Advances on Three Fronts Towards Guisui

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] After the Baoding garrison army joined forces with the reinforcing Nationalist army yesterday afternoon, they jointly launched a northern offensive at 2:00 AM on the 21st.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] The Suppression Headquarters announced that the Nationalist army in Pingdong had completely controlled Xianghe and the three Hui north-south areas. Our light cavalry units have been clearing and suppressing the areas along the Grand Canal, including Hewuwu, Matouzhen, and the northern Wangjiabanqiao area east of Tongxian, for several days, with significant results.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] The Suppression Headquarters announced that Shangyi in Chabei had been safely evacuated. The Communist Jin-Cha-Ji 6th Military Sub-district troops, numbering approximately 4,500, engaged in fierce fighting with our army on the afternoon of the 21st, killing over a thousand Communists. Currently, our troops and the county government have retreated to the northwest of the county seat and are continuing to engage in fierce fighting with the Communists.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 22nd] The Suppression Headquarters announced that the Guisui National Army had launched offensives on three fronts: east, south, and west. The western advance reached Salachi, the eastern advance crossed Qixiaying, and the southern advance cleared the Communist troops in the Xigoumen area. They are currently continuing to advance towards Liangcheng and Helin.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 22nd] At dawn on the 22nd, the Communists who had failed to attack the northwest highlands of Nuoma, east of the city, regrouped after a brief respite and launched another attack on our position in the early morning. The defending army calmly met the attack and engaged in fierce fighting with the Communists until approximately 10:00 AM, inflicting over 500 casualties on the Communists, thwarting their offensive again. After 11:00 AM, the Communists and our forces engaged in intense artillery fire in the eastern mountain area, but there was no infantry contact. All other areas were quiet. Although it was drizzling on the 22nd, the air force continued to conduct air strikes, interwoven with the sounds of artillery fire from the suburbs.

### Wounded Soldiers from the Xuzhou Campaign are Airlifted to Nanjing in Batches for Treatment

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Our wounded soldiers from the Xuzhou surrounding area campaign have been airlifted to Nanjing in batches since the 21st. Over two thousand people have arrived in the past two days. While resting at the airport, they told reporters that the Communists were using human wave tactics to fiercely attack Xuzhou. The number of Communist casualties far exceeded those of the Nationalist army. During the clearing of the battlefield by the Nationalist army, Communist wounded soldiers were often found abandoned on the battlefield. Nationalist wounded soldiers, in addition to receiving rapid treatment at the front, were also airlifted to the rear for treatment, a world of difference compared to the Communist side.

### Establishment of an Economic Coordination Committee, Lai Pu-han Expresses Pleasure, Stuart Lyman Flies Back to the United States from Shanghai Yesterday, Qingdao Economic Cooperation Sub-Bureau Allocates Funds to Support Industrial Components

[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to strengthen cooperation with US aid, adjust material resources, and stabilize the financial economy, the Executive Yuan passed the establishment of an Economic Coordination Committee on the 20th. Lai Pu-han, Director of the US Economic Cooperation Sub-Bureau here, issued a statement yesterday, expressing his pleasure with this self-help measure and stating that he was willing to provide as much support as possible under the principle of full cooperation. He said that he welcomed this opportunity to allow the US aid plan to be fully adjusted in accordance with the plans produced by the Economic Coordination Committee and other implementing committees.

Lai expressed his great satisfaction with the establishment of the committee. He said that this measure was aimed at increasing production and major import and export trade to benefit the Chinese people. Its effective implementation should strengthen China's economic situation and improve the welfare of the Chinese people.

Dun also said that in addition to the US$60 million worth of materials that have already been consumed or distributed since June 30 of this year, the Economic Cooperation Administration can expedite the shipment of US$140 million worth of major materials to China in the next four months. Therefore, the effect of the US aid plan in the next four months should more than double that of the past five months. When formulating plans, the Economic Cooperation Administration will do its best to cooperate with the work of the Economic Coordination Committee in order to maximize the effectiveness of both parties.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 21st] The Economic Cooperation Administration announced today that the new approved amount passed in the week ending November 17 brought the total amount of the Administration's spending on the revival of China to US$151,791,881.

From now on, Green will continue to serve as an advisor to the Economic Cooperation Administration's construction component plan, and the work of the Witt Engineering Company will be presided over by Tailin. Tailin will be responsible for supervising and coordinating the above plan.

[Report from This City] The Qingdao Sub-Bureau of the Economic Cooperation Administration is currently providing US$2 million to support two component plans.

### Communist Broadcast Statement Opposes US Aid to the Government

[United Press, San Francisco, 21st] A Communist broadcast statement on the evening of the 21st stated: "Any assistance given to the National Government by any foreign government, and any agreement signed between any foreign government and the National Government, cannot save the rule of the National Government or protect the rights and interests of that foreign government. The Communist Party firmly believes that any economic and military assistance given to the National Government by the United States or other governments is a hostile act against China and the Chinese people and should be stopped immediately. If the US government sends armed forces to fully or partially protect the National Government, this act will constitute an armed invasion of China's sacred territory and sovereignty, and all consequences will be borne by the US government." The statement continued: "The Chinese Communist Party, the People's Democratic Government, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are willing to establish equal and friendly relations with all foreign countries, including the United States, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of all foreign people in China, including the rights and interests of Americans, but China's territory and sovereignty must be kept intact and not infringed upon."

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st] The Chinese Communist Party issued a declaration denouncing President Chiang's request for the United States to militarily intervene in China's civil war. Political circles here regard this as a test to determine the extent of President Chiang's ability to resist and the extent to which the United States intends to aid the Chinese government.

### Badawei Leaves Japan and Returns to Shanghai

He Discussed the Situation in China with MacArthur

[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] Major General Badawei, head of the US Joint Military Advisory Group, returned to China from Haneda Airport by army plane at 12:25 PM (Tokyo time) on the 22nd and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 6:00 PM (Shanghai time). Badawei came to Japan on the weekend of the 20th for an informal meeting with MacArthur. It is generally believed that the two discussed the situation in China. The content of this meeting is highly confidential, and no official statement has been issued. According to informed sources at the Allied Headquarters, it is logical for MacArthur and Badawei to discuss the situation in China and even exchange opinions on the situation in China. China is outside the scope of MacArthur's authority, so MacArthur often avoids matters related to China. However, on March 3, 1948, MacArthur made an exception when he published his views on China at the request of the Diet.

### British Ambassador Arrives in Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] British Ambassador Stephen arrived in Nanjing by plane from Hong Kong at around 3:00 PM on the 22nd. Foreign Minister Wang, Zhou Shukai on his behalf, and the envoys of India, Burma, Australia, and Canada, as well as senior staff of the British Embassy, went to the airport to greet him. Shi has been away from China for more than two months. In addition to returning home for vacation and reporting on his work, he also attended the British Empire Far East Diplomatic Conference in Singapore before returning to his post. According to those who greeted him, this conference has a comprehensive plan for the British Empire's anti-communist work in the Far East.

### Party, Government, and Military Reform Plan, The Central Standing Committee Only Tasks a Small Group with Research and Drafting

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee convened an extraordinary meeting at 10:00 AM on the 22nd to discuss the current situation and party affairs. It was decided to elect Yu Youren, Ju Zheng, and more than ten others to form a small group to study and draft a reform plan for the party, government, and military, which will be submitted to the Central Standing Committee for discussion and then submitted to the President for approval and implementation. The main purpose of the plan is to address the current situation and strengthen the military suppression of the rebellion. In terms of party affairs, new plans will also be formulated to address the current situation, promote the spirit of revolution, and serve as a guide for future work. It is also heard that this plan is related to the policies of the future new cabinet. Once the new plan and new policy are determined, new candidates can be proposed to reorganize the cabinet. Mr. Weng is currently waiting for this. The launch of this reform movement is actually due to the Xuzhou war and the economic situation, and will be a major transformation of the Kuomintang's spirit. When the meeting was held on the 22nd, Tian Kunshan presided over the meeting, and each committee member spoke separately. Regarding the reform plan, they all advocated adopting an active and dynamic approach, using suggestions instead of criticism. The small group is divided into two parts: one is to study party affairs, convened by Yu Youren, Chen Lifu, and others; the other is to study military, political, and economic issues, convened by Ma Chaojun, Xiao Zheng, and others. Li Wenfan, Zhang Qun, Deng Wenyi, Wu Tiecheng, Liu Wendao, and others participated, and it was decided to hold a meeting within a few days to complete the draft in a short time.

### US State Department Spokesman Declares, "We Will Do Our Best to Support the Chinese Government," Coke Accuses the United States of Having No Clear Policy Towards China

[United Press, Washington, 21st] A US State Department spokesman on the 21st denied that the United States had never clarified its "purpose" in China. Supporting the Chinese government is our purpose, since World War II. We have done our best in this regard.

A State Department official recently issued a statement commenting on the remarks of Admiral Coke, the recently retired commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet. Admiral Coke told United Press reporters that the United States had not clarified its purpose in the policy it had adopted in China. Admiral Coke also called for the establishment of a "strong committee" to guide US actions in China. The State Department declined to comment directly on this committee's proposal.

[United Press, Sonoma, California, 21st] Admiral Coke, former commander of the US Navy in the Western Pacific, told United Press reporters in a solo interview on the 21st that the United States was losing to the Soviet Union in the Western Pacific. He criticized the inefficiency of past US actions in China.

When asked if he thought it was too late for the United States to regain its former position, Coke replied that the United States should first answer the following two questions clearly: "What is our purpose in the East?" and "What is the necessity of their purpose, and to what extent do we support their purpose?" Coke continued, The United States has never had a clear policy toward China. At some times we have done nothing, and at other times we have taken many actions, but if we have a definite and lasting purpose, we should always support it. We cannot adopt a dual policy in China, on the one hand attempting to rebuild prosperity under the National Government to limit the development of Communism, and on the other hand allowing the CCP to receive unlimited assistance from the Soviet Union and allowing them to harass the country, and the Soviet Union has a treaty of friendship and alliance with the Chinese government.

Regarding the former, Congress approved a large appropriation for aid to China this spring, part of which was military aid, but to the best of my knowledge (although I don't know if it is correct) the first ship carrying munitions to China sailed from Seattle only a week ago. Our actions are so slow that we are losing time, and I dare say that if we continue to be so slow in allocating aid to China and shipping aid materials, and continue to be so slow in implementing the actions we want to achieve, and if the National Government fails as a result, then the consumption of our wealth will be equal to waste.

We can never get rid of our moral responsibility to China and think that we should stand idly by in China's civil war. We must never forget that we introduced Soviet power into the Northeast, North China, North Korea, and the Kuril Islands. We wasted a year and a half trying to pull the CCP into the Chinese government. In fact, in the process of the Soviet Union replacing us and controlling the Western Pacific, the Northeast had already been given to the communists. We once let the wolf into the house in China, so how can we turn around and accuse the Chinese government of being corrupt and incompetent without giving it assistance?

When asked whether the victory of the Communist Party in China meant that the Communist Party would control all of Asia, General Coke replied: "No one can answer this question, but the activities of the Communist Party in Indonesia, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies are all facts. I have no way of knowing whether they can unite, but the risk that Japan will be forced into the Communist sphere of influence has obviously increased."

### Full Text of Madam Chiang Kai-shek's Broadcast to America

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Madam Chiang Kai-shek, at the invitation of the American Broadcasting Company, delivered a radio address to the United States at 9 p.m. on the 21st. The entire speech is as follows:

Friends in America, I am speaking to you from Nanjing, the capital of China.

Recently, many foreigners have invited me to visit the United States to explain the current situation in China. Because my country is currently engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the Communist bandits, I am grateful for the kindness of all parties, but I am unable to spare the time. Therefore, I am pleased to accept the invitation of the American Broadcasting Company today to have this brief talk with you via radio.

The current situation in China is indeed very serious, and I have no desire to conceal it. Winter is approaching, and my compatriots are suffering from hunger and cold in terrible circumstances, filled with anxiety. This situation is not because China lacks food and fuel, but because, following years of devastation by the Japanese, the Communist bandits have systematically destroyed transportation, making it impossible for materials to circulate in most areas. In addition to this blockade plot, the Communist bandits have also spread cunning and ruthless propaganda, which has undeniably weakened the courage of many people. Recent military setbacks have certainly contributed to this propaganda. If you want to understand the actual situation in China, you must first understand the importance of this propaganda factor in the current situation in China.

Does the insidious and vicious nature of Communist propaganda still need to be explained to the American audience? For two years, you have been familiar with how the Communist Party has used its tricks in the United States. A loyal civil servant of the American government, who did not sign his real name, published an article in the October 20th issue of Reader's Digest, detailing how the Communist Party uses various methods to frame and coerce dissidents. After the Communist Party discovered the person's real name, they spread rumors of persecution, turning the residents of his city (I must remind you, this is in an American city) against him, even against his wife and children, forcing him to move to another state. After reading this news, I was surprised to find that this was exactly the same as the tactics of the Communist bandits in China; the methods are the same. Many misunderstandings in the United States about the situation in China are due to the Communist bandits and the Communist International distorting the facts.

The Chinese Communist bandits, like Communists in other parts of the world, are experts in using propaganda to deceive the world. In order to damage the prestige of the government at home and abroad, they spare no effort to slander the President, myself, and members of our family. When our country resisted Japan, because resisting Japan happened to suit the Communist bandits' purposes, they praised us as heroes. But today, they attribute all the ills of China to us. Some gullible people in the country, as well as others who should have a clearer understanding, have unknowingly accepted these Communist bandits' false propaganda. It is painful to say. The latter are cowards, weak-willed, and accommodating. There are also those who hope to please the Communist bandits in order to escape disaster when the Communist bandits win. Everyone understands the speculators and wavering elements in previous wars, and unfortunately, China is not exempt from this type of person. But if the Communist bandits think that these propaganda tricks have weakened the will of the Chinese government, then their estimate is completely wrong. Now, I can assure American friends that, despite some disappointing events recently, the President and I have not been discouraged in the slightest. We are determined to continue to engage in the righteous war of suppressing the Communists, lest the country fall behind the Iron Curtain. Our will is now as strong and unwavering as when we began suppressing the Communists, and our belief in final victory is extremely strong. We feel that most of our lives have passed, and we only hope that God will bless us to continue to dedicate our remaining years to the work of building a free China. This is the work to which we have been consistently and faithfully devoted for the past twenty-five years. As long as the President and I have a breath left, we will resolutely fight to eliminate the threat of the evil Communist bandits. Even if we fail, we will have no regrets other than lamenting the brevity of life and dedicating this one life to serve the country. (To be continued tomorrow)

[Central News Agency, New York, 21st] Madam Chiang Kai-shek's broadcast to the American people has received considerable attention from both the government and the public here. Some radio stations will rebroadcast the recording of Madam Chiang Kai-shek's speech for those who have not yet heard it. At the same time, the local morning newspapers will also publish the full text of Madam Chiang Kai-shek's speech in a prominent position. The front page of the New York Herald Tribune used a large-font headline to say: Madam Chiang Kai-shek appeals to the United States to provide assistance quickly, otherwise the Communist army will rampage in Asia. The New York Times also published Madam Chiang Kai-shek's speech on an inside page, with the headline: Madam Chiang Kai-shek asks the United States to provide further support in this struggle; if the United States hopes to contain the Communist military rule in Asia, it must rapidly aid China.

Editorial

### Principles for Handling Confiscated Goods

During the period of strengthened management, the quantity of materials confiscated due to general warehouse inspections, inventory declarations, and special reports is considerable. In addition to ongoing efforts to sort through and determine disposal methods, there are reportedly still many unresolved pending cases. The Committee for Handling Confiscated Goods has agreed upon principles for these pending cases and is starting to clear them up, which is naturally what everyone is eagerly hoping for.

Due to rising prices, some of these confiscated goods have actually benefited from their misfortune, gaining unexpected profits due to being "ordered to be hoarded." However, in general, the mental and material losses suffered by these depositors are a great source of pain. It is said that a certain owner of confiscated goods repeatedly appealed based on reason and was eventually granted a return. Overjoyed, he opened the warehouse to find that, due to the long time that had passed, most of the goods had spoiled and were no longer usable. He abandoned the list on the ground and left in despair. This illustrates the losses suffered by merchants. Originally, the durability of various goods varies, and there is more than one agency responsible for enforcement. By the time one stumbles around and finds an agency capable of handling the matter, and after going through procedures such as investigation, review, consultation, and decision-making, it is naturally not as simple as when the goods were confiscated. No wonder many goods with poor durability and improper storage conditions deteriorate and change.

Now that the handling principles have been decided, we naturally hope that they will be implemented promptly to avoid aggravating the losses of the owners. As for how to handle the procedures, we believe that the highest principle should still be the law.

In addition to the special laws for food, the most appropriate standards are the "Emergency Measures for Suppressing Hoarding of Daily Necessities During Times of Emergency," the "Regulations for the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce," and the subsequent regulations and supplementary points issued by the ministry regarding the suppression of hoarding. According to these laws, the penalties and confiscations are specified in Articles 17 and 18 of the measures. The conditions for hoarding are defined as: (1) Daily necessities announced by the central and local governments according to law, categorized into five types: food, clothing, fuel, daily necessities, and other goods designated with approval. In other words, items not specifically designated above and not subject to legal announcement procedures should not be subject to the above laws. (2) The elements constituting hoarding are: (a) A person who is not engaged in commercial activities or a merchant not engaged in the business purchases and stores a large quantity of the aforementioned designated items; (b) A merchant engaged in the business purchases and stores the above-designated items and engages in hoarding behavior. Hoarding behavior is defined in this law as not selling in the market and raising prices above the legal profit stipulated by the local competent authority. Therefore, if the goods have already been sold on the market and the price increase does not exceed the legal profit, or if the local competent authority has not stipulated this legal profit, it should not be considered hoarding. As for the term "large quantity," the notes for attention clarify it as: (a) For direct consumer goods, anything exceeding the needs of each person for three months is considered a large quantity; (b) For business needs, anything exceeding one-fifth to one-third of the annual needs is considered a large quantity. The supplementary points stipulate that: If the goods are needed for the business of the merchant, they should not exceed one-quarter of the annual needs, except for seasonal items. According to this supplementary provision, it can be seen that: (1) The three-month limit only applies to personal consumer goods and does not apply to business needs; (2) The amount for business needs, whether one-quarter, one-fifth, or one-third of the annual needs, is clearly inconsistent and lacks a clear legal interpretation; (3) Seasonal items are not subject to the above one-fifth, one-quarter, or one-third restriction. Therefore, the common saying that goods hoarded for more than three months should be confiscated can only be regarded as a warning to hoarders. In fact, there is no corresponding legal basis for it.

As for goods confiscated because the quantity discovered during inspection or registration does not match, or is over-reported, under-reported, or the types and colors do not match, most of these are probably due to errors in the paperwork. Moreover, after registration, reports stated that the relevant authorities had ordered that sales should continue as usual and should not be refused on any pretext. Therefore, when conducting an on-site inspection after several days, the inventory may not match due to sales in compliance with the order or replenishment at any time, which is an unavoidable fact. If a confiscation penalty is imposed for this reason, it seems unfair and lacks a legal basis. It should be noted that when the registration was carried out, most people complied with the order to report, but a considerable number of people delayed registration. Moreover, at the beginning of the registration announcement, it seemed to only mention that it was for the purpose of understanding production and sales conditions or coordinating distribution. At that time, there was no prior warning that failure to report or over-reporting would result in confiscation. Therefore, we believe that it is excessive to retroactively implement overly strict measures, and those who refuse to comply with the registration are not affected, which is too advantageous for them.

We are not saying these words to defend a group of unscrupulous merchants. On the contrary, for those hoarders who are truly guilty, we also advocate for severe sanctions. However, any sanctions must be based on the law so that they will accept it willingly. If the circumstances are excusable or if the law does not provide a clear article to invoke, the goods should still be allowed to be returned or the punishment should be reduced to protect the rights of legitimate merchants. Now we have entered the constitutional stage, and various control laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertainty. What is considered a heinous crime today and should be severely punished may suddenly become a thing of the past tomorrow and be considered insignificant. There are many examples of this. As the ancients said, "If you understand the situation, be compassionate and do not rejoice." In this era of disorder, it seems that it is better to be lenient than to be excessive, which can maintain some public support!

Therefore, they filed an impeachment case against Song and Du, which was reviewed and established by Supervisory Committee members Wang Xiangchen, Zhang Zhiguang, Ding Shurong, and others. The Supervisory Yuan has transferred the case to the Executive Yuan for disciplinary action in accordance with the law on the 22nd.

The tracks were filled with obstacles such as stones and wood. The driver immediately stopped the train. More than 50 bandits suddenly jumped out from both sides of the track, fired shots, and boarded the train. Railway police engaged in the fight, but due to being outnumbered and running out of ammunition, they were unable to resist. One person was shot and killed on the spot, and three passengers were injured. Under the cover of gunfire, the bandits boarded the train and robbed all the belongings of the 60 male and female passengers, leaving them with only their shirts and shorts. After succeeding, the bandits fired shots and shouted as they left. Fortunately, there were few passengers that day, and the tracks were not damaged. The passenger train was able to reach Kaiyuan, and the injured have been sent to the hospital for emergency treatment. The security authorities are currently reporting the incident and strictly pursuing the bandits.

### The People of Hangzhou Bitterly Resent Rice Speculator and Demand Execution of Zhong Weiquan

### Partial Labor Strike at Nantong Dasheng No. 1 Factory

Workers Vandalize Union Chairman's Residence

[Our Nantong Correspondent, 22nd] A partial labor strike suddenly occurred at the Dasheng No. 1 Factory in Nantong around 7:00 AM on the 22nd. The female workers felt that their indexed wages did not keep up with prices, and they also made informal requests for salary advances. After a week of brewing discontent, some female workers blocked the day shift from entering the factory outside the premises as the night shift was leaving this morning. Subsequently, the group went to the residence of Wang Qin, the chairman of the county's general labor union and concurrently the chairman of the factory's union, and vandalized clothing and furniture. They then dispersed in a rush. Local authorities, upon hearing the news, dispatched representatives to investigate the truth. According to the factory, workers' benefits, including indexed wages and rations, are handled according to Shanghai standards, so this incident must have been a misunderstanding. All those who caused the trouble were female workers. Only two-tenths of the workers came to the factory today, but work continued as usual. Once the truth is clarified, a reasonable resolution will be made.

### Marshall Arrives in Washington Yesterday Afternoon; White House Meeting Reviews the Overall Situation; Concerned About the Situation in China and Considering New Policies

[Our Report] Washington, 22nd Broadcast: Truman and Marshall are scheduled to meet at the White House today at 12:30 PM. An hour before the meeting began, Truman received a report from Harriman, the European Inspector of the Economic Cooperation Administration, stating that the United States' prestige abroad has greatly increased since the US election, and Europeans feel that liberalism is on the rise, enough to overwhelm reactionary forces.

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall will meet today to review the development of foreign policy in the first phase after the election. This development will largely determine the fate of China and the future course of the United States' strategy against international communism.

[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] President Truman returned to Washington yesterday on the "Independence" aircraft from Key West, ending his two-week vacation in Florida to prepare to shoulder the heavy burdens of domestic and world affairs. Secretary of State Marshall is expected to fly from Paris to Washington this morning to hold an important meeting with the President to review the global situation. Truman will also meet with Secretary of Defense Forrestal and Harriman, the European Inspector of the Economic Cooperation Administration. The main issues facing the United States are as follows: (1) What form of control should be adopted for the Ruhr region, the industrial heart of Germany? In view of France's strong opposition to any return of the Ruhr to German control, President Truman's early decision on this matter is necessary. (2) Should the United States fully support the Chinese government in its war against the Communist forces? (3) How much military spending should be requested from Congress in the 1949 fiscal year, and how should this military spending be allocated? (4) How much funding should be allocated to the Economic Cooperation Administration in the second year? (5) The issue of the North Atlantic Defense Agreement. (6) Changes in cabinet personnel.

[United Press, Washington, 21st] Responsible sources said today that President Truman will retain Marshall as Secretary of State for a considerable period of time during his meeting with Marshall today. Secretary of Defense Forrestal also seems likely to remain in office for several months. If Marshall remains in office, Under Secretary of State Lovett will also remain in his position.

### Western Response Undergoes Final Revision; Submitted to Neutral Nations Today; UN General Assembly President Believes Berlin Problem Can Be Solved

[United Press, Paris, 22nd] UN General Assembly President and Australian Foreign Minister Evatt said in a radio address to the United States today that there are now reasonable hopes that the Berlin stalemate can be resolved within the next three weeks (i.e., before the end of the UN General Assembly). The crux of the dispute between the Soviet Union and the United States, Britain, and France is a matter of timing, not a matter of principle.

The main issue is to find a timetable acceptable to all parties to lift the Berlin blockade and unify the Berlin currency. The Soviet Union requires both to proceed simultaneously, while the United States and Britain require the blockade to be lifted first before negotiations can begin.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] Financial experts from the three Western powers held another meeting today to make final revisions to the three countries' response to the memorandum submitted by Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia regarding the Berlin currency issue. Political observers predict that this response may be completed on the 23rd. Bramuglia has already received the Soviet Union's response and will compare it with the three Western powers' response to determine whether the Berlin currency unification issue can proceed simultaneously with the gradual lifting of the Berlin blockade.

### Italian and Belgian Prime Ministers Hold Extensive Talks

[Agence France-Presse, Brussels, 21st] Well-informed sources have learned that while Italian Prime Minister Gasperi was stationed here, he had extensive talks with Spaak to discuss Italy's accession to the Brussels Pact.

### National Leader's Position Consolidated; Communist Intelligence Agency's Strategy Fails

[Associated Press, Belgrade, 21st] The Communist Intelligence Agency's campaign to overthrow Marshal Tito over the past four and a half months has completely failed. Tito and other leaders now have complete and confident control over Yugoslavia. The relationship between Yugoslavia and the Communist Intelligence Agency and Western countries has the following two important aspects: (1) As far as can be seen at present, Yugoslavia intends to move politically closer to the West. (2) Yugoslavia has not suffered any economic crisis threatened by the blockade imposed by Communist Intelligence Agency countries. The above two points are worthy of attention, as representatives from countries other than Britain and the United States have the opposite views and are understood to have reported these views to their respective governments.

### East Germany Implements Production Increase Campaign

[United Press, Berlin, 21st] The Communist Party in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany is promoting a German-style "Stakhanov movement" to increase industrial production. Stakhanov was a Soviet miner who invented a new method of mining coal, producing far more than usual, and thus turned it into a production increase campaign. Germany's fake Stakhanov is a certain miner named Hennels, who looks like a counter-revolutionary. It is rumored that he personally dug out 380% more coal than the daily quota. Although this figure is exaggerated, it has been used by the Communist Party.

### United States Changes Initial Position; Refuses to Supply Weapons to Japan

Continued Supply Would Cause Trouble

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 22nd] A spokesman for the US authorities here told the news media bluntly today that the US authorities no longer take into account the demands of General Eichelberger of the US Eighth Army, who previously supported Japan, and refuse the Japanese government's request to supply Japan with light weapons and ammunition. The US authorities believe that Japan "does not need to increase other armaments in addition to its existing armaments." Eaton, head of the Police Department of US Headquarters, said: The 120,000 Japanese police have 25,000 pistols for their use, and they have ample control over this number. He believes that there is no need to supply Japanese police with rifles and light machine guns again, because this matter may cause endless trouble.

### US Intelligence Personnel Confirm Soviet Buildup in Germany; Marshal Rokossovsky's Headquarters Moves to Mecklenburg

[Our Report] London, 22nd Broadcast Berlin News: US intelligence personnel today confirmed the news reported by German newspapers that Soviet Western Army Commander Marshal Rokossovsky has established headquarters in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany. The newspaper said that the headquarters is located in Mecklenburg, and Rokossovsky has moved to Mecklenburg from Insterburg in East Prussia. The newspaper also stated that the Soviet occupation forces in Germany have strengthened their strength, and at the same time, the Soviet Union is concentrating manpower and material resources in the hope of using strong actions to promote its political objectives. The US side does not particularly believe the rumors that the Soviet Union has increased its occupying forces. They also do not believe the rumors that Rokossovsky will replace Sokolovsky, the supreme commander of the Soviet forces in Germany.

### Soviet Union Fiercely Criticizes British and American Policies; Demands Foreign Troops Withdraw from Holy Land; Britain and America Confer Secretly to Eliminate Differences

[Associated Press, Paris, 22nd] The Soviet Union today in the United Nations Political Committee accused Britain and the United States of doing their best to turn Palestine into a tool for their military policies and "their oil feuds." Soviet representative Tsarapkin rejected the Bernadotte Plan and accused Britain of manipulating Palestine by merging the Arab state in the Holy Land with Transjordan. He claimed that Britain and the United States are using "pressure" to change the United Nations General Assembly's partition plan. Tsarapkin said that the United Nations should order all foreign troops to withdraw from the Holy Land, obviously referring to the Arab armies now in Palestine. He continued, "If there were no Anglo-American conspiracies, there would be two independent countries in Palestine today without bloodshed."

[Associated Press, Paris, 21st] Britain and the United States agreed on the 21st to try to eliminate their differences on the Palestinian issue in a secret meeting, so that they could adopt a biblically consistent line on Holy Land policy before the UN Political Committee votes on the issue. British and American experts are now preparing to exchange views and find common ground to avoid the continuation of the deadlock in the committee. The United States apparently wants to let the Arab and Jewish representatives negotiate directly, and the United Nations need not give detailed instructions. But Britain supports the recommendations of mediator Bernadotte to revise the Arab-Jewish border in the original partition plan.

### Israel Establishes Diplomatic Relations with Southern Hungary and Romania

### Japanese Diet Decides to Dissolve After Amendment to Civil Service Law Passes; Prime Minister Yoshida Announces at Press Conference

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd] Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida, when hosting reporters on the afternoon of the 22nd, stated in strong terms that the cabinet is determined to dissolve the Diet. Yoshida said: "The Diet could have been dissolved originally, but the amendment to the Civil Service Law and other important bills could not be discussed and passed, so we endured it temporarily, hoping that all important bills could be passed during the session. The Liberal Party has absolute confidence in seizing power in the next general election. The next general election may be held within this year.

As for the issue of rectifying discipline, it has nothing to do with whether the Diet is dissolved. The current cabinet is determined to implement it thoroughly and will not allow similar Showa Denko incidents to happen in Japanese political circles again. After Japanese politics establish credibility internationally, foreign investment can naturally be introduced to participate in Japan's economic recovery work. In the future, if the House of Representatives again obstructs discussions on the supplementary budget bill and the amendment to the Civil Service Law, an emergency meeting of the House of Councillors will be convened to discuss the supplementary budget bill based on the new salary standards, so that it will be passed in the House of Councillors first."

From his remarks, the seriousness of the conflict can be seen. He proposed an eight-point economic plan, advocating the restoration of price controls and excessive profit taxes.

### Municipal Council Holds Symposium to Discuss Total War; Speaker Pan Vigorously Condemns Defeatism, Urges Colleagues to Help Stabilize Public Morale; Make All Citizens Unite and Defend Themselves to Become a Bastion of Safeguarding Democratic Politics

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council held a symposium at its Tanggu Road headquarters at 3:30 PM yesterday to discuss total war and the valuation of the Shanghai Public Transportation Company. The attendees included Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Speaker Xu Jiguang, and 119 councilors. Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, and more than 30 city government officials attended. Speaker Pan presided over the symposium, delivered the opening remarks. Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan successively reported on the current problems in Shanghai, the issue of total war, and the implementation of the total war program. Subsequently, Councilors Jiang Hao, Zhang Zhihan, Shi Zongde, Fei Duesheng, Zhang Zhongyuan, Zhou Xiangsheng, Wu Zheng, Ji Hao, Yu Shun, Yan Esheng, and Jiang Haoran spoke one after another. The symposium adjourned at 6:30 PM. The meeting passed the following three points: (1) The various opinions on the issue of total war will be recorded by the General Assembly Secretariat and sent to the municipal government and the garrison headquarters for reference. Councilors who did not have the opportunity to speak due to time constraints can submit their opinions in writing to the General Assembly, which will forward them to the municipal government and the garrison headquarters. (2) Regarding the issue of tax collection in the city after the price limits are lifted, the municipal government should consider collecting taxes without changing the tax rate. (3) Regarding the issue of valuation and stock offering of the Public Transportation Company, due to time constraints, it was decided that the municipal government should consider a solution, and the council will organize a subcommittee to review it first.

The various opinions expressed by Speaker Pan, Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, and the councilors are recorded below:

Speaker Pan delivered the opening remarks, stating in brief: The seventh session of this council adjourned on September 15th. At that time, the city was strictly implementing price controls, and the superficial appearance of society seemed to be the most stable period in recent years. However, in no time, due to strict management in Shanghai and relaxation in other areas, the price control policy failed. Initially, there was a rush to purchase and hoarding of goods that were not sold, followed by the government abandoning price controls, and prices soared like a runaway horse, but there was still no supply at the set prices. On the other hand, due to the reversal of the military situation in the suppression of bandits, after several famous cities in the Northeast and Henan-Shandong were abandoned one after another, the focus of the war has shifted to the Xuzhou area in northern Jiangsu. Under the mutual stimulation of this economic phenomenon and military situation, the morale of the rear cities, especially the Nanjing-Shanghai area, inevitably became volatile. In addition, Communist Party infiltrators seized the opportunity to fabricate rumors, causing unnecessary turmoil in the entire society. An atmosphere of defeatism gradually spread, and even many intellectuals and social leaders were more or less poisoned by the Communist Party's propaganda offensive and were oppressed by the Communist Party's psychological warfare, believing that the government's power would be difficult to sustain. Not only did very few people use a calm mind to consider the consequences of success or failure, or that this war is an anti-aggression and anti-totalitarian war related to world peace and national security, and then lead by example to raise the awareness of the general public, to correct international perspectives, but some people even echoed "peace rumors." If it were not for the President's decisive command, with unwavering will, to sternly refute them, the current situation would be difficult to imagine. Gongzhan believes that the key to the success or failure of suppressing the rebellion is that military affairs and popular morale are equally important. The gain or loss of a city or a pool in military affairs may not be enough to affect the overall situation, and the key to success or failure is entirely in our own minds. A single cry at night, the preservation of the desire for destruction, the song of Chu on all sides, and the defeat at Gaixia, such historical traces that can be picked up at any time, everywhere can illustrate that the psychology of defeatism is absolutely unacceptable. Here, I cannot help but point out that in the three years of the Communist Party's rebellion, the government has always been unwilling to abandon the promotion of democratic politics and has strived to maintain the "normal state." This painstaking effort should be worthy of our love, but the Communist Party has taken advantage of this opportunity to allow infiltrators to penetrate into all levels of society, creating all kinds of incidents, disrupting social order, hindering social stability, and disturbing people's minds to the extreme. The military movements on the front lines are certainly sufficient to affect the morale of the rear, and the volatility of the morale of the rear is even more sufficient to dissipate the morale of the front lines. We should resolutely stop this floating phenomenon from recurring. If what I have said above is not wrong, then my colleagues in this council, in today's difficult situation and social turmoil, should take assisting the government and stabilizing people's hearts as the first priority, so that all Shanghai citizens can unite strongly and defend themselves, and become a great fortress for safeguarding China's democratic politics. What Gongzhan wants to reiterate today is that the authorities are studying how to implement a wartime cabinet, and each war zone has gradually strengthened the total war measures under the common goal of military first and bandit suppression above all else.

Please Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan Explain the Total War System

The Nanjing-Shanghai area has recently been designated as a garrison area, and military, political, economic, and even social activities and personal lives will be placed under the form of a total war plan for reform. The general public in this city is still not fully aware of the content of the total war system. Today, I would like to ask Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan to give us instructions on the spot. However, Gongzhan believes that in order to achieve the victory of bandit suppression and military affairs, and to strive for the independence and freedom of the nation and nation, in this serious period of correcting chaos and returning to normal, the people cannot but temporarily sacrifice a part of their personal freedom, abandon certain aspects of certain interests, and accept certain extraordinary constraints. In other words, we should fully endure everything stipulated in the martial law. In terms of government administration, perhaps some departments must be coordinated with military operations, and even placed under the unified command of the military, which is also expected. Whether councilors of this council are elected by regional or professional groups, or selected by parties, they are all representatives of all citizens of the city. Under the implementation of the total war system, what work should we do and how should we complete our tasks? These are all things that are worth our deep consideration. At the same time, I also hope that our military and political authorities can appreciate that Shanghai is China's premier city, and that its reactions are very sensitive in terms of politics, economy, society, and culture. All movements in Shanghai are especially sufficient to affect the whole country. When necessary, in order to ensure the smooth implementation of all plans and to ensure that they are in line with the public opinion, they should be able to give the public opinion representatives of this council, within certain limits, the opportunity to deliberate and contribute, so that our usual insights and knowledge, and the wisdom and ability of each person, can be used to do something for the country and the local area. I believe this should be a basic condition for my colleagues in this council to fulfill their duties.

### Appeal to Citizens to Rush to Raise Funds to Protect Their Hometowns, Lives, and Property

Secondly, "Finance is the mother of all administrations." If the city's treasury income cannot be sufficient, all plans for municipal facilities will be equivalent to empty words. The current situation is difficult and close to desperation, and the financial difficulties of the city have reached an extreme. My colleagues in this council have the responsibility to supervise the city's finances, and at the same time have a moral obligation to help the municipal authorities solve their financial difficulties. We certainly hope that the municipal authorities will reduce some unnecessary expenses, especially today, there should be no more wasteful expenses to beautify the situation. However, several major events in front of us, such as the start-up costs and provisions for the establishment of the Garrison Brigade and the Self-Defense Corps, and the salaries of the city's police officers, teachers, and staff, all require financial resources to be injected. Regarding the Garrison Brigade and the Self-Defense Corps, they are the local self-defense forces that this council has long hoped for. Gongzhan remembers that at the opening of the fifth session of this council at the beginning of this year, he called on the citizens of the city to rush to raise funds and train local forces to assist the national army in defending their hometowns, to use local salaries and funds to support local militias, and to use local militias to protect local lives and property for the sake of the city's security. Today, what we are asking for is exactly the same. The citizens of the city, especially wealthy merchants and big businessmen, must be vigilant about the ancient训"Under a toppled nest, there are no intact eggs," and generously donate as much as possible under the goal of "everything for bandit suppression and everything for military affairs" to fully cultivate the local forces in the city. As for how to improve the treatment of police officers, teachers, and staff so that they can maintain a low standard of living, it is also a serious issue at present. To hope that the soldiers will bravely kill the enemy, they must have elite troops and sufficient food, and their horses must be full and well-fed. To hope that the police officers, teachers, and staff can serve with peace of mind and work hard in their posts, their income must be sufficient to support their families. The military and police are the pillars of the country, and the teachers and staff are the backbone of society, and their positions are equally important. This point, I believe, all my colleagues in this council can understand. However, how to find new sources of income is indeed an important topic at present. We would like to ask Mayor Wu to express his views. But in any case, according to our calculations, if several items in the city's taxes can be properly adjusted in accordance with the dynamic adjustment of prices, the salaries of police officers, teachers, and staff can be barely covered. And for the expenditure on the establishment of local forces, opening up financial resources is unavoidable. The financial resources that are opened up should not only be able to be dynamically adjusted in accordance with prices, but also hope that they will come from the principle of having money to contribute. Only when we truly "have money to contribute and effort to contribute" can we suppress the Communist bandits and protect the security of this city and even our country.

Do Not Miss the Current Opportunity

Finally, what I want to reiterate, but it is also the most important point, is that this symposium of this council is being held at the time when the Battle of Xuzhou has just ended victoriously. This period of time is worthy of our rejoicing and even more worthy of our treasure. Why do I say this? The great victory of the Battle of Xuzhou can be called a turning point in our country's survival. The military results of this great victory were to defeat 200,000 Communist bandits and protect hundreds of miles of mountains and rivers in Jianghuai. The political, economic, and international benefits were even greater. When the good news came, not only did people's hearts cheer up and prices plummet, but it also changed the views of the US government and the public towards our government, which is sufficient to have a great impact on the work of aiding China. These are indeed rare signs in recent years. We should make good use of this precious opportunity, learn from the pain, investigate the root causes of the past failures of the country, and make some efforts to re-establish the government's lost prestige, seek reforms in political affairs, and start anew with the people. Only then will the country have hope, and only then will we gain more support, and US aid will come without being expected, and it will be strengthened without being expected. The motivation for this council to convene this plenary symposium was originally due to the case of the asset valuation of the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Public Transportation Company, which had to wait for everyone to review it today. However, at a time of difficult situations and social turmoil, several important issues have to take advantage of this rare gathering to exchange opinions with each other in order to contribute to the country. Gongzhan is worried about the difficult times and is deeply moved. The above is inevitable, and I am not careful in my words. I hope that my colleagues will give me more advice.

### The Yangtze River is a Natural Barrier That Bandits Cannot Easily Cross; Mayor Wu Calls on People to Defend Greater Shanghai

Mayor Wu said in his speech: The most serious problems in Shanghai at present are three: (1) The food problem: The current rice panic has passed, rice is coming in steadily, and the price of rice has fallen to about 400 yuan, and it is expected that there will be no more major fluctuations. (2) Wage problem: The compilation of the index for the first half of November is absolutely correct. The reason why workers are not satisfied is that at that time, it was rumored that the price of rice was 2,000 yuan per dan, so it could not be listed as a standard. The current labor-capital disputes are being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau, the General Labor Union, etc., and can be gradually resolved. (3) Financial problem: This is the most difficult problem to deal with at present. The lives of public school teachers and staff are extremely difficult, but the city government's income and expenditure cannot be balanced. The city government hopes that the council will assist in how to adjust taxes to seek a balance of income and expenditure. As for the total war problem, the detailed measures will be reported by Commander Xuan. I personally think that the people who flee to Hong Kong are the most foolish. If the Communist bandits attack southern China, Hong Kong will inevitably become an isolated bird in two months. Where will the people of Hong Kong flee to then?

Shanghai has factories, banks, and foreign exchange, and its wealth is enough to support an army of 150,000. Moreover, the Huangpu River is a natural boundary. Defense strongholds are set up in the river, and the Communist bandits cannot attack. As long as Shanghai can hold on for a month, it can lay the foundation for victory. If it can hold on for two months, it can gain the sympathy of countries around the world. If it can hold on for three months, friendly countries will naturally provide us with a large amount of military supplies. Therefore, as long as the people of Shanghai have the determination, the courage, eliminate the mentality of fleeing, cooperate with each other, and jointly defend Greater Shanghai.

### Commander Xuan Reports on the Main Points of Total War

Commander Xuan said in his speech: The total war in the Songhu area will be jointly supervised by the heads of local party, government, military, council, and other relevant agencies to organize a committee. The main points of its implementation are (1) Military Department: Efforts should be made to enrich the forces. Whether it is the Garrison Brigade, the Security Regiment, the Security Police, or the People's Self-Defense Force, they must be actively trained to strengthen local forces. The replenishment of troops and sources of soldiers should be improved. Fortunately, there is the natural and solid Huangpu River, which can protect Shanghai. (2) Political Department: Strengthen the organization of district offices, town offices, and security offices, investigate households and ships on the Huangpu River, so that Communist Party members cannot infiltrate, severely punish corruption, strictly implement assessments, rectify political discipline, and all eligible young men must serve, and organize children's teams and women's teams to mobilize the people as a whole. (3) The economic department should also be improved, because the Communist bandits are using economic reform as an offensive strategy. We should improve ourselves first, and then we can attack them. We must win over the people, train the people, and use the people, and use the entire strength of the people to eliminate the Communist bandits.

### Senior Officials' Families Flee to Hong Kong; Councilors Criticize One After Another

Councilors' Opinions: (1) Jiang Hao: The people absolutely support the government. The various facts in the past are enough to prove that the people have not let the government down. It is only the government that has let the people down. It is not only the Communist bandits who are creating rumors, but also senior government officials. They tell the people not to flee, but their own families slip away first. At this critical juncture, the government itself must not have factional struggles, and should sincerely cooperate to save the critical situation. (2) Zhang Zhihan: During the implementation of total war, the army must strictly abide by discipline and must not disturb the people everywhere, and then we can talk about military-civilian cooperation. (3) Shi Zongde: Senior government officials sing the praises of defending the land, while their own families flee first. We hope that the local government will be stricter in checking whether there are any senior government officials among the travelers to Hong Kong. (4) Fei Shusheng: The mayor and Commander Xuan said that they are determined to defend Shanghai with the Huangpu River as the boundary. We are determined to follow the mayor and commander to jointly defend Shanghai. However, for the families of senior government officials who have fled to Hong Kong, we should tell them to return to Shanghai immediately, otherwise their property in Shanghai will be confiscated and their official positions will be revoked. The Communist bandits' propaganda newspapers and periodicals should be banned from entering the country, and the distorted broadcasts from Hong Kong should also be interfered with by radio waves so that the citizens cannot listen to them. (5) Zhang Zhongyuan: The families of Wang Yunwu and Wang Shijie not only fled to Hong Kong, but also fled to the United States. For this group of people, the government should immediately expel them from their nationality. The city should strive for social stability and sufficient food. (6) Zhou Xiangsheng: In fact, Hong Kong is not a comfortable place. It is an isolated island surrounded by water. Once it is bombed, there is no place to take refuge. (7) Wu Zheng: The mayor expressed his admiration for Yan Xishan's defense of Taiyuan. We hope that the mayor can also learn from him and express his views, and would rather make Shanghai his burial place and never leave Shanghai. (8) Ji Hao: Everyone must not have the mentality of fleeing. (9) Yu Shun: The government's policies must not change frequently, so that the people's hearts can be stabilized, industry and commerce can be normal, and the local area can be defended. (10) Yan Esheng: We should organize a review committee to review whether those who go to Hong Kong have the necessity to do so. For those who go purely to flee, each person should be limited to donating 2,000 yuan to be used as a refugee relief fund in the city. As for the business tax, we hope to reduce the donation rate to maintain the difficulties of the merchants. (11) Jiang Haoran: Central politics and local politics should be coordinated, and everything should be done according to local conditions and according to people. The young men drafted in Shanghai should not be sent to Taiwan, but should defend the local area in Shanghai.

### Zhu Jia-hua Concerned About the Economic Situation of Various Schools; Convenes Meeting of University Presidents; Special Funds to be Issued to Solve Difficulties of Private Institutions

[Our Newspaper's Report] Minister of Education Zhu Jia-hua, accompanied by Secretary Fang Zhimou, arrived in Shanghai on the 21st and returned to Beijing by night train last night.

Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Minister Zhu convened a meeting at the Academia Sinica with the presidents of public and private universities, independent colleges, and vocational schools in the city.

It is reported that during the meeting, Minister Zhu provided a detailed analysis of the overall situation, explaining that the suppression of the rebellion is related to the survival of the nation and the individual. The government is determined to quell the banditry and will see it through to the end. He hoped that people in the education sector would work together to support national policies. Minister Zhu expressed his appreciation for the hard work of colleagues in various schools who continued to work diligently and proceeded as usual despite the recent turbulent situation and public anxiety. Minister Zhu expressed his concern about the impact of recent price fluctuations and the living conditions and financial situation of teachers and staff in various schools. Minister Zhu believes that the funding for national institutions can be improved after being readjusted, and the procedures for transferring funds will be expedited as much as possible to meet urgent needs. Minister Zhu stated that the ministry has always been very concerned about subsidies for private institutions. However, due to budget limitations, the allocated subsidies can only express the central government's encouragement and concern. Private institutions are currently facing more financial difficulties than before, and special funds will be allocated for subsidies.

Presidents Zhang Yi, Wang Zhizhuo, Xia Jianbai, Zhou Junshi, and Li Xinyang spoke successively at the meeting, reporting on the situation of various schools in detail, and expressed that colleagues in the education sector are determined to adhere to their original intentions and remain steadfast in their positions so that school affairs can become more stable.

### Presidents of Private Universities and Colleges Propose Two Solutions

[Our Newspaper's Report] Various private colleges and universities in the city previously decided to increase tuition and miscellaneous fees or take an early vacation due to drastic price fluctuations and economic difficulties. Yesterday afternoon, the presidents of various private colleges and universities raised this issue for discussion at Minister Zhu's tea party. It was generally believed that increasing tuition fees would impose too much burden on students, and taking an early vacation would affect students' studies. The presidents of various schools then proposed two requests: (1) Please allow the Central Bank to overdraft 5 million gold yuan, to be distributed evenly among the schools. The schools will mortgage school property, guaranteed by the Ministry of Education, and repay it at the beginning of the next semester. (2) Private school teachers and staff should enjoy the same in-kind distribution rights as public school teachers and staff to stabilize their lives. In addition to expressing that he had requested the central government to allocate special funds for subsidies, Minister Zhu promised to work hard to implement the two requests. After the tea party, the presidents of various schools exchanged opinions on this matter. Since the early vacation period is not far away, the principle will still be that each school decides based on its own situation.

[Another Report] President Ou of Daxia University told reporters that the second tuition fee increase will not be implemented, and the school decided to maintain operations until the end of December, taking a two-week early vacation compared to the original school calendar. In addition, St. John's University does not adopt mandatory regulations for the second tuition fee increase.

### China Textile Plans to Move Spindles to Taiwan and Guangdong; First Batch Set at 50,000 to 70,000

Regarding China Textile's decision to move some spindles to Taiwan and Guangdong, our reporter learned that the reason for the move is that there is a strong need for yarn and cloth in these two places. However, the yarn factories in Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shanghai are facing a large number of spindles that have stopped operating due to a shortage of raw cotton and power. Rather than abandoning them, they would be better utilized by moving them elsewhere. Therefore, in principle, it has been decided to list a portion of the 75,000 spindles that have stopped operating in Tianjin, Qingdao, and Shanghai as the first batch to be moved to Taiwan. However, there is also a shortage of power in Taiwan, and efforts are being made to improve it. Before the power problem is resolved, only 30,000 to 40,000 spindles will be moved temporarily. 20,000 to 30,000 spindles will be moved to Guangdong.

### Tailoring Industry Dispute; Directors and Supervisors Petition

All the directors and supervisors of the Tailoring Industry Association went to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to petition. During the price-controlled period, the wage per suit was 13 yuan.

However, after the index was announced this time, the workers still demanded that the 5 yuan subsidy be calculated according to the cost-of-living index, which the employers refused to do. The workers are now skimping on the work for the suits they make. They brought suits as evidence when petitioning yesterday, requesting the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate. The Social Affairs Bureau believes that this lacks work ethic and has decided to convene a meeting of labor and management for mediation this morning.

### Trial Opens for the Case of Impersonating a Garrison Department Official and Raping a Dance Hostess; Cai Meizhen Narrates the Details of the Harm While Weeping

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yan Feng, who impersonated a staff member of the Garrison Headquarters and raped dance hostess Cai Meizhen with a gun, was brought to trial by Judge Wang Kanghou of the District Court at 4:00 PM yesterday. In addition to the victim, Cai Meizhen, a dance hostess at the Xinhua Dance Hall, Shi Weiren, a staff member of the Xinhua Dance Hall, Zhu Shunjia, a foreman, Yuan Shishan, a foreman at the Venus Dance Hall, and Ding Dasheng, a bookkeeper at the Nanjing Hotel, were also summoned to court to testify. The victim, Cai Meizhen, is only seventeen years old, and was dressed plainly. She narrated the details of the harm she suffered while weeping. According to her, she met the defendant before September 4. He called himself a staff member of the Garrison Headquarters and often brought a handgun into the venue. She was afraid to speak out because of his power and did not dare to say anything. On the evening of September 4, the defendant invited her out to dinner. After dinner, he insisted that she go with him to the New Life Club on Weihaiwei Road to dance. Three others, including a friend of the defendant and a dance hostess from a famous dance hall in Shanghai, were already there. They danced until 1:00 AM. The defendant initially wanted her to row a sampan on the Huangpu River on the Bund, and then forced her and the other three to rest briefly at Room 30 of the Nanjing Hotel. Soon, his friend and the dance hostess from Shanghai left. The defendant locked the door and raped her three times with a gun. About two hours later, his two friends came again, as well as the tea server on the third floor of the hotel, and persuaded her not to cry. She was heartbroken and left in anger. Witnesses Shi Weiren, Zhu Shunjia, and Yuan Shishan successively testified that the defendant often went to the dance hall to dance, claimed to work at the Garrison Headquarters, and did not pay for tea or dance tickets. Ding Dasheng, the bookkeeper at the Nanjing Hotel, said that the defendant had often used the name "Liu Zhong" to book rooms at the hotel for three or four months before the incident, and each time he brought a woman to stay with him. The rest of his testimony matched the victim's account. When questioned, the defendant Yan Feng flatly denied the rape. The court ordered the police to escort the victim to identify and summon the dance hostess from the famous dance hall in Shanghai, whom she only knew by sight but did not know her name, as she was crucial to the case. The court then adjourned the trial to a later date, and the defendant was remanded in custody.

### Central Bank Implements New Foreign Exchange Transaction Management Measures Yesterday; Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates Issued by Designated Banks Can be Exchanged for Foreign Telegraphic or Mail Transfers

[Our Newspaper's Report] New measures for managing foreign exchange transactions began to be implemented yesterday. The Central Bank yesterday notified all designated banks with a circular numbered One One Six Zero that all foreign exchange transactions should be handled in accordance with the following regulations starting immediately:

(1) Foreign exchange earned from the export of goods should be transferred to the Central Bank through designated banks, and the designated banks will issue foreign exchange transfer certificates of equal value.

(2) Foreign exchange remitted to the country by Chinese expatriates abroad (including all remittances from abroad) should be transferred to the Central Bank through their designated banks, and the designated banks will issue foreign exchange transfer certificates of equal value, or directly sold to the Central Bank or its designated banks at the market price of the foreign exchange transfer certificate on that day.

(3) Foreign exchange transfer certificates can be exchanged for foreign telegraphic or mail transfers at the Central Bank or its designated banks for the following purposes: (A) Payment for imported goods for which import permits have been issued by the Import Management Committee, (B) Foreign exchange needs for "non-imported goods" approved by the government.

(4) Foreign exchange transfer certificates can be freely bought and sold by designated banks or foreign exchange brokers. The validity period for foreign exchange payment with the transfer certificate is 20 days.

(5) Expired transfer certificates must be sold to the Central Bank or its designated banks. The exchange rate for the sale will be based on the lowest market price on the last day of the validity period.

(6) In the circulars previously issued by the Central Bank to various designated banks, if the clauses contradict the provisions of this circular, the latter shall prevail.

Procedure for Designated Banks to Handle Foreign Exchange Transfers

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the implementation of the "Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificate" method, the Central Bank issued Circular No. 161 to designated banks yesterday to provide explanations. The full text consists of eleven points, the main points of which are as follows:

(1) Designated banks must issue foreign exchange transfer certificates only after receiving foreign exchange. The issuance of this certificate should be done with linked numbers.

(2) The foreign exchange received from issuing transfer certificates must be transferred to the Central Bank after the end of business hours on the same day, together with the second copy of the transfer certificate.

(3) Foreign exchange may be transferred to the Central Bank in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Tianjin. However, the Central Bank's payment of foreign exchange for the transfer certificate will depend on whether the local designated bank has foreign exchange deposited with the Central Bank.

(4) Designated banks may, at the request of the customer, issue one or more transfer certificates for the foreign exchange received, but the total amount of foreign exchange may not be different, and other key points may not be changed.

(5) The foreign exchange transfer certificate is a four-part form. The original is issued to the customer by the designated bank, the copy is retained by the designated bank for reference, the third copy is handed over to the Central Bank together with the foreign exchange, and the fourth copy is submitted to the Central Bank together with the designated bank's transaction report.

Management of Transfer Certificates is More Flexible and Simple than Foreign Exchange Settlement Certificates

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Designated Banks Association held a temporary member meeting at the Bank of China at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Representatives from 28 member banks, including the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, Citibank, and HSBC, attended. Chairman Chen Changtong first reported the contents of the three circulars of 160, 161, and 162 related to foreign exchange management by Shao Zenghua, Wu Changbin, etc., and explained them point by point. Then, a meeting was held immediately to discuss and decide on the following key points:

(1) Foreign exchange transactions will resume from today (23rd).

(2) The foreign exchange transaction fee remains at 1.25%.

According to a person in charge of a designated bank, the nature of the foreign exchange transfer certificate is very similar to the foreign exchange settlement certificate before the currency change. However, the management method is more flexible and simple than before. The former had a term of seven days, while the latter is extended to two months. The former had a distinction between "ordinary" and "special," while the latter does not. Therefore, the transaction of foreign exchange transfer certificates in the future will not be subject to time and quantity controls, and can fully reflect the needs of the market, resulting in a natural level of market price. It can technically facilitate the promotion of import and export trade, and it is also very helpful for attracting remittances from overseas Chinese.

Regulations on the Ratio of Various Foreign Currencies to Gold Yuan

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the issuance of the Gold Yuan Amendment Regulations and the new measures for managing foreign exchange, the Central Bank yesterday issued Circular No. 161 to various designated banks, stipulating the exchange rate of various foreign currencies to Gold Yuan as follows:

British Pound 1 = Gold Yuan 60

British Pound 1 = US Dollar 3
Hong Kong Dollar 1 = US Dollar 0.1875
叨 Dollar 1 = US Dollar 0.35
Rupee 1 = US Dollar 0.225

Swiss Franc 1 = US Dollar 0.25

Peso 1 = US Dollar 0.50

The Central Bank may change the above ratios at any time by notifying them through circulars when necessary.

### Nearly 10,000 Stones of Rice Arrive on the Market; Rice Prices Fall Again

Yesterday, there was an enthusiastic arrival of rice, and the registered arrival volume in the two markets reached a new high. 2,952 stones, 7 dou, and 5 sheng arrived in the Nanshi market, and 6,752 stones arrived in the Beishi market, totaling 9,709 stones, 7 dou, and 5 sheng.

According to industry insiders, the surge in rice in the city is actually because the rice price in other ports is much lower than in the city. Along the Beijing-Shanghai line, the rice price in each county does not exceed 300 yuan, while the rice price in the city is close to 500 yuan for white japonica rice. Grain merchants are going to the production areas to sell rice in Shanghai due to the profit to be made, resulting in the largest arrival volume in three months.

Yesterday's market situation showed that prices continued to weaken. Market quotations were 450 yuan for white japonica rice in Nanshi, 480 yuan in Beishi, 456 yuan for thin indica rice in Nanshi, 470 yuan in Beishi, 450 yuan for early rice in Nanshi, 430 yuan in Beishi, and 450 yuan for Yangxian rice in both markets. However, actual transactions were around 420-430 yuan for white japonica rice, a further drop of 60-80 yuan compared to the end of last week.

Flour

Affected by the drop in rice prices, the market atmosphere also turned sluggish. The opening and closing price of the "Warship" brand flour was 150 yuan, and the transaction was not active. Old Che flour was 160 yuan, down 5 yuan. Other miscellaneous brands of flour uniformly turned weak, down 6-7 yuan.

Edible Oil

Continued to decline. The opening price of the local factory's soybean oil was 730 yuan, and the closing price fell to 720 yuan, a drop of 60 yuan compared to yesterday's market. The local factory's rapeseed oil was 600 yuan, and the Zhongzhi factory's rapeseed oil was 580 yuan, a significant drop.

Miscellaneous Grains

Arrival volume surged, and customers were eager to sell for cash. Immediate transactions were generally sluggish. Qidong corn was 140 yuan, Hankou green beans were 175 yuan, white sesame seeds were stable, and raw peanuts were down 30-40 yuan.

### Southern Transportation Ban Lifted, Buying Interest Strong, Yarn Prices Rise Across the Board

Yesterday, the yarn market experienced a surge in prices due to positive news such as increased consolidated taxes and the lifting of the southern transportation ban. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn once soared to 11,500 yuan before retracting to 11,200 yuan at close, marking a further increase of 1,000 yuan compared to the weekend. 21-count Double Horse yarn also saw good sales, closing at 8,000 yuan, up 800 yuan. Other counts of both coarse and fine yarns also rose by 400 to 500 yuan, up to around 1,000 yuan.

The cotton cloth market was robust. Due to the lifting of the southern transportation ban on cotton yarn, yarn prices were reported to have risen across the board. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was quoted as high as 395 yuan, eventually falling back to 370 yuan at close, a rebound of 40 yuan compared to the weekend. Four Gentlemen Yuan drill closed at 365 yuan, up 35 yuan. 190 high-end Shilin cloth prices rose to a high of 670-680 to 700 yuan, with the market also showing strength.

### Great Demand for Subsidiary Currency, Nation Prepared

[This Month's News] The deadline for the redemption of legal tender expired on the 20th of this month and has been decided by the Executive Yuan not to be extended. It has been noted that during the period when legal tender was in circulation, a portion of it was used for small change. Now that its use has been ordered to cease, the market's need for small change in gold yuan and subsidiary notes will be more pressing. The Issuing Department of the Central Bank, aware of this, has made full preparations. If businesses and industries have a need for small change and require subsidiary currency notes, they can directly exchange them at the department located at 24 Wai Street.

### The Situation in Northwestern Hunan

Mr. Li further emphatically called on the revolutionary youth of northwestern Hunan to unite and march towards the construction of northwestern Hunan, calling on 100,000 youths and 100,000 cadres to defend Greater Hunan. Youth work brigades and national reconstruction brigades have now been universally established in the counties under its jurisdiction, and they will be trained in Changde in stages and then distributed to various levels to carry out their work.

According to the resolutions of the Pacification Conference, the counties along the Xiang River have begun to strengthen the construction of fortifications. The area from Changde to the counties under its jurisdiction, especially the Eighth District, which is known as a special area without a single inch of highway, will open up new roads. The Engineering Department of the Provincial Highway Bureau has now sent specialists to survey the area, and the Telecommunications Bureau is also cooperating with this unprecedented transportation construction movement to carry out construction separately. The Seventeenth Pacification Headquarters has established a demonstration zone in Dangde and established a guidance committee, with Xie Ping, the director of the political work department, concurrently serving as chairman and the city defense commander being responsible for planning. The first phase of work has begun. The household registration of each township in the jurisdiction has been thoroughly cleaned up. The thirteen middle schools and more than thirty elementary schools in the demonstration zone are simultaneously implementing "mobilization for national reconstruction unified unit design teaching."

Northwestern Hunan is characterized by high mountains and remote areas, and the local situation is unique. Feuds occur from time to time. Local impartial individuals have witnessed that the government has not decisively handled feud cases and dares not make any moral response, allowing local tyrants to run rampant, which has been the case for more than a day. On October 18, Qin Wenquan, the deputy secretary of the Qiancheng County Party Department, was unfortunately assassinated. Upon receiving the report, the commander was furious, as it was just when Mr. Li had taken office and the Pacification Conference was in progress. He expressed his determination to severely punish Xiang Shifeng, the speaker of the Qiancheng County Council, who instigated the assassination of Qin Wenquan, according to national law, in order to eliminate harm for the people. After repeated investigations and trials, the evidence of the main perpetrator Xiang Shifeng and accomplices Luo Xinglian and Qiong Laosan, unemployed vagrants, was conclusive. They were sentenced to death and executed by firing squad in Changde by the headquarters on the 15th. This was the first salvo of Mr. Li's governance of northwestern Hunan.

### Major Theft at Yangzhou Tax Collection Office

Over Ten Thousand Gold Yuan in Inventory Vanish

[Our Jiangdu Dispatch, 22nd] A shocking theft occurred at the Tax Collection Office in this county on the night of the 21st. The safe in the cashier's office was pried open, and 12,000 gold yuan in inventory, a checkbook, a telephone, and miscellaneous items were stolen, resulting in considerable losses. The search for clues is underway.

### Indonesian Communist Leader Muso and Others Killed

[Our Batavia Dispatch, 16th] Indonesian communist leader Muso, who had stayed in Russia for 25 years, and Ali Amin, who had stayed in Russia for more than 10 years, launched a rebellion in Marifun, Java, and formed a separate "People's Government." After being fiercely suppressed by the Republican Army, both of them have been killed recently. However, their party members and troops, numbering several thousand, are still harassing and engaging in guerrilla warfare.

[Another Dispatch] This year, overseas Chinese in Indonesia can receive 103 guilders per parent for remittances to support their families. If they specify that the remittance is to be sent to the motherland, they can remit more than 110 gold yuan. If they specify that the remittance is to be sent in Hong Kong dollars, they can remit approximately 140 Hong Kong dollars. According to the current black market exchange rate, six Dutch guilders can be used to remit one gold yuan. However, the official exchange rate of the Dutch Indies government is still nine guilders and one and a half cents to remit one gold yuan. Such losses are excessive for overseas Chinese dependents. It is hoped that the government will quickly notify the Dutch Indies government to lower the exchange rate to benefit the lives of overseas Chinese dependents in the motherland.

### Changzhou Expands Winter Relief Organization

[Our Wujin Dispatch, 21st] The Winter Relief Association of this county, due to the large number of poor, orphaned, disabled, and displaced refugees in this county, making relief work difficult, has launched a widespread campaign. The chairman of the committee is concurrently held by the county magistrate, and 100 directors of various social groups and chambers of commerce, as well as local notables, have been appointed as committee members.

All sectors of society will automatically solicit donations. The funds received will be handed over to the Grain Association by the administrative group to purchase and store rice for relief purposes.

### The Mystery of Gambling Opening in Guangxi

— Our Special Correspondent, Liang Yushan

[Our Guilin Dispatch, 18th] More than a month ago, there was a rumor here: "Guangxi will lift the ban on gambling." Considering the past achievements of Guangxi's ban on gambling, this statement was simply unbelievable. As events progressed, the rumor gradually turned into a thought-provoking mystery. Although the answer has not yet been revealed, clues are emerging, and the matter is no longer just a rumor.

To make the truth clearer, it is necessary to first trace back to the beginning of last month, when the provincial government held a provincial administrative conference. The discussion of provincial issues at the meeting was very detailed. In order to solve the current financial difficulties of the province, the Provincial Security Command summoned the county magistrates and other members attending the meeting to hold a secret meeting, and put forward an informal proposal to "lift the ban on gambling to enrich the finances."

Increasing Tax Revenue

During the discussion of the issue, there were two factions, and the debate was very intense at the time. The reasons held by those who supported the proposal were: "The current financial situation is difficult, especially in Guangxi, a province known for its poverty. The economy has always been poor, and coupled with the impact of the current environment, financial resources have become even more depleted, seemingly reaching a dead end. In order to alleviate the current predicament, it is necessary to find ways to increase revenue. There are many ways to generate wealth, but distant water cannot quench immediate thirst. Some people have suggested that the province open up gambling to enrich tax revenue." The opposition faction, "led by Huang Ronghua, the director of the Construction Department, strongly opposed it. He eloquently stated that Guangxi's ban on gambling has achieved considerable results in the past two years. If we change our past approach one day, wouldn't we be abandoning all our previous efforts, and even cause chaos?" However, as a result of the debate, the supporters were still in the majority, and they said that gambling has already become prevalent, and it is better to simply open it up than to have it exist in the private sector in a hypocritical manner. Perhaps it won't be as severe, and the government can also increase a batch of tax revenue from it." The issue was deadlocked at the time, and the proposal was formally reserved, but in fact, it was awaiting the authorities' decision.

Special Zones

Chairman Huang has always respected public opinion and did not express any views on this matter. At the same time, he telegraphed a certain important person for instructions. Although he has not yet received a reply, from another perspective, even if the matter is not approved, it will at least not be rejected. According to recent official disclosures: "Opening up is inevitable, and concrete plans have also been drawn up. The entire province will designate Liuzhou, Wuzhou, Longzhou, Nanning, Guixian, Guiping, Pingle, Yulin, Yishan, and Baise as ten 'special zones.' Clubs will be established in each zone, and they will be opened up in a planned manner. Formally, a commercial contracting system will be adopted, and the heads of each zone have already been dispatched. Chen Shouyun (manager of the Guilin City Bank) has been internally appointed as the general manager of the province."

The current economic predicament is undeniable. When everyone is at their wit's end, those with simple minds may inevitably yearn for a bright future. However, the issue of public security in the future is worth worrying about. "Where do evildoers come from? They come from opium and gambling." Please give the provincial authorities careful consideration. Sooner or later, the facts will provide an answer as to what will happen in the future.

Revenue Collection Bureau

In September of this year, in order to strictly prohibit the planting and transportation of opium, the provincial government established the Opium Suppression Supervision Office in Nanning, and also established branch offices in Yulin, Wuzhou, and other places, forming a strict opium suppression mechanism. Judging from the results of seizing drugs in the past few months, the province has made a strong determination to suppress opium. However, just a few months after the vigorous campaign, another rumor has emerged, and there are already considerable signs of it. It is said that "the province's opium suppression will change its established policy. The planting and trading of opium will still be strictly prohibited in the province, but the passage of opium to provinces outside the province will be temporarily relaxed." This requires discussing technical issues. It is rumored that the authorities are considering how to reorganize the opium suppression agency and how to take the overall situation into consideration. Therefore, the Opium Suppression Office seems to be about to be changed into a "Revenue Collection Bureau." The most concerning thing is the consequences of the matter. What will the consequences be in the future? Let's wait for the near future to verify!

### Wuxi Proposes Rent Standards

[Our Wuxi Dispatch, 19th] The County Tenants Association has resolved the following rent payment standards: (1) For the former rent of eleven installments, the rent will be paid according to the previously agreed method. (2) For the first half of November, payment will be made based on the gold yuan base, with eight yuan and ten cents paid for each gold yuan. (3) For previously agreed rents calculated in rice, each dan of rice will be based on nine gold yuan, equivalent to seventy-two yuan and ninety cents per dan.

### Nantong Executes Female Bandit Leader Lu Meiying

[Our Nantong Dispatch, 19th] Lu Meiying, the 21-year-old leader of the Bandit Jinsha Women's Resistance Association, committed numerous evils and murdered many people. The Nantong Garrison Command, with approval, executed her by firing squad on the afternoon of the 18th. This female bandit was captured during our suppression campaign in early summer. After interrogation, she confessed without reservation and was sentenced to death. However, because the female criminal was six months pregnant at the time, the execution was not carried out immediately. She gave birth last month and delivered a son, who has now been sent to the local nursery for care.

### The Ugly Ku Klux Klan

— Diao Ying

"Roosevelt was a communist!"

"Roosevelt's goal was to establish a communist-ruled world empire!"

"The Truman administration is a Jewish communist government!"

Anyone with a little common sense who hears these absurd and ridiculous slanders will probably just laugh them off? However, there are people in America who are shouting and making a fuss like this, with leaflets and pamphlets flying everywhere, seemingly creating a raging movement. And what's even more unbelievable is that there are quite a few people who consider these words to be creeds and are clamoring to join this movement. Those madmen have strengthened one of the ugliest groups in American history—the Ku Klux Klan.

The Ku Klux Klan has always made it its primary task to abuse people of color. Innocent black people are often brutally murdered by them using unspeakable means. This is the famous lynching. What is strange is that even the judiciary is tolerant, feigning deafness and ignoring it. As a result, the power of the Ku Klux Klan is growing in the southern states of the United States. The American Civil War was fought to liberate slaves, but even after the war ended, these Klansmen still often held secret meetings. Around 1930, the leaders of the Ku Klux Klan were notorious for extorting money everywhere and had to temporarily disappear. However, recently, after President Truman formally proposed a bill of human rights, reiterating the protection of black people's equal status, the Ku Klux Klan in the southern states took the opportunity to stir up trouble, publicly expanding its organization and absorbing many new Klansmen!

Klansmen always cover themselves with white cloths and wear a pointed cloth hood on their heads. They cover their faces, leaving two holes for their eyes, like European executioners from the 17th and 18th centuries. On the one hand, they look hideous and terrifying, which is in line with their terrorist methods, but on the other hand, it is not because they are afraid of being recognized when they commit crimes. However, the white cloth covering the body is not very long, so the trousers worn by the Klansmen are exposed. Recently, an American journalist went to interview the Ku Klux Klan meeting and saw several Klansmen wearing police uniforms! With the police attitude like this, the lawlessness of the Ku Klux Klan can be imagined.

The leaders of the Ku Klux Klan in each state are called "Grand Dragon." The "Grand Dragon" of Atlanta is a middle-aged doctor named Green. On the day in August of this year when new Klansmen were sworn in, that "Grand Dragon" stepped onto the altar in a green satin robe and publicly declared: "The separation of races was originally the will of God! This party is determined to maintain the superior position of white people, and this party is determined to return the southern states to the rule of white people... If those northerners dare to act rashly, then don't blame us for being impolite, we are not afraid of bloodshed!"

According to that "Grand Dragon," out of the 159 cities in the state of Georgia, 130 cities have organized the Ku Klux Klan. In addition, states such as Tennessee, Alabama, and Florida all have very large organizations. Their mission is to be anti-black, anti-Jewish, and anti-Catholic. If you have ever met a Chinese living in the southern United States, he will definitely tell you that the Ku Klux Klan is really not very polite to the Chinese.

The Ku Klux Klan is not afraid of bloodshed, which may be true. In Georgia, a black couple was walking at dusk when three or five "not afraid of bloodshed" Klansmen rushed up and whipped the two black people all over with blood, and as a result, they were not punished at all. There is a dormitory in Alabama that is exclusively for black women. One night in mid-June of this year, a large number of masked Klansmen broke in and committed heinous acts—but the authorities did not investigate! The reason is that the local police chief said that there are too many Klansmen among his police officers.

Enlightened people in the United States feel that they are making too much trouble and are doing their best to curb the activities of these masked thugs. Newspapers and religious groups have constantly criticized them, but the activities of the Ku Klux Klan have never been truly sanctioned. In 1925, 50,000 white-robed monsters marched proudly down the streets of Washington, and their behind-the-scenes people took the opportunity to coerce and make tens of millions of dollars. Although the situation is different now, the politicians who are promoting the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan are also quite powerful. Their purpose is to threaten black people, prevent them from voting, and attack Truman. But Truman finally won! Does he really have the courage to resolutely challenge the local forces of evil? That will depend on the development in the next four years.

### School Janitor Ah Jin

— Xin Ren

Arriving at school against the north wind, it felt a bit chilly. I wanted to drink some boiled water to warm up, but when I picked up the thermos, it felt surprisingly light. Looking around the office, the books and records were scattered, and the desks and chairs were covered in a thin layer of dust, not at all like usual.

"Hey, where's Ah Jin?"

The headmaster replied:

"He's sick and took the day off."

Just then, Old Chen, who had seen off a guest and returned from the station, chimed in:

"Who said that? I saw him with my own eyes, carrying six dou of rice, getting on the bus."

This made the headmaster laugh. The headmaster was usually very amiable; how could he get angry about this? Besides, with only ten dollars a month, it was indeed a bit demanding to not find some extra work.

Ah Jin was a new school janitor hired this semester. He was over fifty years old and had worked for the government before. Once he took over, the school's miscellaneous tasks were all on track. Compared to the teenage girl from last semester, who even needed reminders to ring the bell, there was simply no comparison.

At first, we thought Ah Jin's enthusiasm for work was motivated by the ten silver dollars he received. Because according to the initial value, it could buy five dou of white rice, which was indeed a rare opportunity in the eyes of the villagers. But as time went on, prices rose sharply, and he still worked the same. This showed that his diligence was entirely natural and not at all fake.

For several days, he suffered from a severe case of malaria but still forced himself to come to school. Sometimes, we saw him sitting weakly in the sun, shivering, and asked:

"Ah Jin, what's wrong?"

He didn't answer, hurriedly shaking his head. Villagers have many taboos, and seeing him trying to stop people from speaking was truly amusing. Today, he had surprisingly caught up with the trend and started working as a "dan bang" (small-scale independent trader). Perhaps he heard that a stone of rice could be exchanged for a dan of sugar or four bolts of cloth? This, besides making us sympathize with his situation, also made us sigh deeply, "The scholar is useless for practical matters."

But Ah Jin's independent trading didn't seem to go as smoothly as others. Because he didn't return that day, everyone already saw the premonition. Hearing others say that because there were many people running, the profits were not as high as before. Over thirty dollars of white rice, when brought to Shanghai, no one wanted to pay even thirty dollars. The sugar and cigarettes he brought back were even more difficult to sell. But what troubled Ah Jin the most was trying to squeeze onto the train. After lining up, he was pushed off several times, and almost got knocked to the ground by the crowd. Finally getting on the train, he unfortunately got on the wrong route, going all the way to Hangzhou on an express train, resulting in fines and lodging costs, causing a lot of trouble. Returning empty-handed today, he seemed much older, with a worried face, calculating how to repay the capital of six dou of rice. Then Old Chen jokingly said:

"Ah Jin, how was the scenery in Hangzhou?"

He smiled bitterly, not saying a word. Then he suddenly looked at the clock and went to ring the class bell.

### Strange Relatives

— Cao Guoping

One day, the humorous master Mark Twain told a strange story:

I married a widow, who had a grown daughter. My father fell in love with my stepdaughter, and ended up marrying her – therefore, my father became my stepson-in-law, while my stepdaughter became my mother, because she is my father's wife.

My wife gave birth to a son, who is naturally my father's brother-in-law, and also my uncle, because he is my stepmother's brother.

My father's wife became my brother's mother, and my brother is also my grandson, because he is my daughter's son.

Therefore, my wife is my grandmother, because she is my mother's mother – I am my wife's husband, and also my wife's grandson – at the same time, I am my own grandfather!

### Miscellaneous Poems on the Lake

— Shi Shufan

Passing He Xiansheng's Yangzhou Former Residence, Lamenting for a Long Time

In dangerous times, his arm protected the mountains and rivers (he once reviewed troops and fell off his horse, breaking his left arm). After his death, he surprisingly had no acres of land. His former officials and students were all over the world. Green moss and yellow leaves fill the hall. The inscription was made on the eighth day of the seventh month (last year on this day, I drafted the epitaph for the master). Tears fall in the autumn wind in the second year. The slanting sun outside the curtain, the swallows chatter in confusion. Returning, I still say the master is sleeping.

My friend Lu Mengjiao built a thatched building on the foothills of Ziyang Mountain, drawing clouds from the sparse peaks, and is engaged in decorating it. Thinking of you turning from Eight Fujian to Suzhou, and soon again going through Guangzhou's campaign, the road has not been rested, why are you so busy? The building site was the palace forbidden area of the Southern Song Dynasty, which has been destroyed and erased for a long time.

The rustling leaves become autumn by themselves. A thatched roof, the lamps are clear, ancient sorrows. Leave it to future generations to point out again: Zhao's Grand Palace, Lu's building.

Post road, mountain journey, then the edge of the water, Qinhuai willows, Wuyi tea, temporarily living here and then hurriedly departing, tomorrow's journey clothes are wet with waves.

### Abandoned Corpse

— Ye Jun

To die without a burial place is the most tragic thing. But in the city of Shanghai, abandoned corpses on the streets have become a "common sight" for most people. Throughout the year, there are deaths from freezing, starvation, disease, poverty, the old, the young, all kinds. Among them, the young are the most numerous, which is enough to prove that in this society, the "weak" are the least fit to survive.

In addition to human corpses, there are also corpses of rats, cats, chicks, etc., which are almost everywhere. As for corpses of cattle, sheep, and pigs, they are people's best delicacies, and naturally they will not be abandoned on the ground.

Animal corpses are not enough to move people's sympathy, which is not surprising; if human corpses are also not enough to move people's sympathy, then if Mencius's saying: "Everyone has a heart of compassion" can be established, we can add a sentence: "Those without a heart of compassion are not human." The following is an example of a "non-human" matter:

Today, looking out from the window of my studio, there is a torn and ripped small corpse at the foot of the opposite wall. My students pointed it out to me, I couldn't see it clearly, I only saw a string of red and purple flesh and blood, with what seemed to be two small legs attached below, and what seemed to be a tuft of black fuzz above (probably hair). The students said it was the corpse of a child. Four or five naughty children were surrounding it, throwing stones at the corpse for fun. This scene was too tragic for me to bear watching, but I also wanted to keep watching, I hoped to be able to clearly distinguish that it was not a human corpse, but an animal corpse. However, they told me that it was indeed a human corpse.

I originally didn't want to write this down, because it was too tragic! But, later I felt that I should still write it out, so that more people know, so that this unfortunate person does not become too lonely. Please, Mr. Editor, donate the fee for this article to any children's education and care institution.

### Thunder Learning

For hundreds of years, the former capital, the beauty of all the architecture of the palace gardens, altars, temples, and monasteries, can be called the best in the country, even compared with the famous cities in the world, it can also occupy a superior position, it is a pity that these few years have been destroyed beyond recognition. Not destroyed during the War of Resistance, but destroyed after victory, not destroyed by artillery fire, but destroyed by people who have fled to reside there, not destroyed by bandits, but destroyed by "capable people" and so-called intellectual youths, which is especially heartbreaking.

The destruction of the Great Altar was briefly seen in last week's telegraphic dispatch of this newspaper, which is the situation in recent months. Before this, in the past two or three years, it had already been occupied by stationed troops, and other displaced youths had lived together, tearing down and burning, which did not happen in a day. The "Temple of Heaven" was the place where emperors of previous dynasties worshipped heaven. The emperor was known as the "Supreme," but the honor of God was above the emperor, next to the emperor was the "Son of Heaven," that is, the son of God. The emperor "faced south," that is, sat facing north and facing south, receiving the congratulations of the ministers, so-called "Under the whole world, there is no land that is not the king's land, and no subject who is not the king's subject," but the emperor was also God's subject, and could only sit beside God in the Temple of Heaven, waiting on God, called "accompanying the sacrifice." Therefore, the vastness of the base of the Temple of Heaven, the magnificence of the architecture, were extraordinarily magnificent, the altar was circular (the ancients thought that heaven was round and the earth was square), and the steps and railings around it were all carved with jade stone in the shape of clouds, dragons, and the eight treasures. Every year the emperor held a grand fire ceremony to worship heaven in the southern suburbs, arriving here outside the main gate, he had to get out of the carriage and walk, first entering the side room to fast and bathe (called the fasting palace), and then dress solemnly, bowing three times and kowtowing nine times. The dignified ninth-five sovereign, had to humble himself here, it can be known that it was incomparably solemn in those days. And now it is dim everywhere, everything is destroyed, a scene of filth and desolation, one cannot help but sigh for God!

Another major building that was destroyed was the Yonghe Temple, where even the bronze Buddha, which was more than ten feet high including the bronze base, was carried away or destroyed and sold. One can imagine the rest. This palace is located inside Andingmen, the northernmost part of the old capital, next to the Guozijian (Imperial Academy) and the Confucius Temple. In the early Qing Dynasty, during the Kangxi period, it was originally the mansion of the fourth prince, Prince Yong, Yinzhen. When Kangxi died, Prince Yong succeeded to the throne, that is, Emperor Yongzheng, moved to the imperial palace, and his former residence, the prince's mansion, was the "Potential Residence" (taking the meaning of "dragon's potential," whoever rises from the potential residence to the inner palace to become emperor, is the flying dragon ascending to heaven). It was not allowed for any nobles to live there. Yongzheng revered Buddha, and especially liked to approach Lama Yili, so he changed it into a place to enshrine foreign Buddhas, with several lamas in charge of incense. It was not called a temple, but a "palace." Large and small Buddha statues, ox-headed gods and snake-bodied gods, men, women, animals, naked embracing, the so-called "joyful Buddha," since the Republic of China, the lamas' lives have gradually become stretched, and the "palace" has been opened, with a yellow curtain covering the lower bodies of the Buddha statues. Viewers would pay money, and the curtain could be lifted, which was a kind of income, which was also pitiful. Now even this is gone, and there is no basis for life at all. If Yongzheng knew in the ground, what would he think?
