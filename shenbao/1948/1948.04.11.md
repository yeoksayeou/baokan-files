### Gu Weijun and Others Visit Lovett to Discuss the Implementation of Aid to China Plan, Truman Also Meets with Kong Xiangxi

[Our Newspaper, New York, 9th Dispatch] Kong Xiangxi paid a visit to President Truman at 3:30 pm, and was received by the American President at the White House. The nature of Kong's visit this time could not be determined. According to Kong's later statement to reporters, the visit was purely a private matter. However, Kong's visit was officially recorded in the White House's record and the conversation time exceeded a normal visit, so most people believed that it must have involved important issues regarding China. White House reporters welcomed Kong and speculated a lot about his visit to the American President. However, some believed that since Kong was a leading Chinese politician, meeting with the President was within expectations. In addition, according to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 9th, Kong Xiangxi told reporters that he thanked the American President for the aid to China.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th, United Press Dispatch] The Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, recently visited the Acting Secretary of State, Lovett, to discuss "Implementing the Aid to China Plan." Ambassador Gu told reporters afterwards that China very much hopes that the Aid to China Plan will be implemented as soon as possible, and he has informed Lovett of this intention. Gu continued by saying that China has not yet issued a letter expressing its willingness to comply with the conditions stipulated in the American aid plan because the U.S. State Department has not yet notified China regarding the form of the letter to be used. However, the American notification will be issued soon, and China will submit the letter in a timely manner. Bei Zuyi, the head of the Chinese Technical Representative Group in the United States, also accompanied Ambassador Gu to visit Lovett this time. According to Bei, he and his team members have been in the U.S. for the past few months consulting with the U.S. side on the details of the Chinese reconstruction plan. Bei said that he will return to China "soon". In addition, former Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi visited President Truman, and the meeting lasted 20 minutes. Kong stated that the visit was "purely private."

[United Press, Washington, 9th Dispatch] Lovett stated that the visit by Ambassador Gu and others was to discuss "the implementation of the Aid to China Plan."

[United States Information Service, Washington, 9th Dispatch] The Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Gu Weijun, stated today that the Chinese government will submit a "letter of intent" before the Aid to China Plan begins to be implemented. He stated that military aid of $125 million and economic aid of $338 million will take effect as soon as possible. He also stated that it is expected that materials will not be delivered immediately until the details are agreed upon.

### Discussion of the Draft Agenda, Chaos at the Meeting Almost Led to Violence

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] The National Assembly's fifth session discussed the draft agenda, and the scene was unprecedentedly chaotic. The meeting began at 9:20 am, with 2,090 representatives present. The seventh group of the presidium took turns to preside, chaired by Xue Dubi. First, the minutes of the previous meeting were approved, and then Bai Chongxi reported on the instructions of the presidium to communicate with General Fu Zuoyi, and it was decided that the General Assembly would send a telegram of condolence. At 9:45 am, Chairman Xue announced the discussion of the draft agenda. Representatives from the Henan region, such as Zhou Yanguang, successively put forward their opinions, believing that before each meeting reviewed national affairs, the heads of each ministry and commission should attend, present reports, listen to reviews, and answer questions. Before long, when Zhou Yanguang's oral explanation of his opinions touched on Chairman Jiang's report on the 9th, citing limited data and time, there were still some details that were not fully covered, which caused public outrage from some of the audience, who used jeering to stop Zhou from speaking, almost leading to violence. Some representatives protested against this, and the meeting became extremely chaotic. Fortunately, Chairman Xue cited Article 59 of the rules of procedure, reminding the attending representatives of their responsibility to jointly maintain order in the meeting. After most representatives responded with applause, the meeting returned to stability, and the disturbance was calmed down. Zhou reiterated his proposal to listen to reports by category and conduct national affairs reviews, and stated that his opinion on Chairman Jiang's report stemmed from his love for Chairman Jiang and he did not expect to be misunderstood by his colleagues. Subsequently, Zhu Huanbiao, a representative from the Soviet Area, proposed that the deadline for joint nomination of the president and vice president and the election date should be discussed and decided by the General Assembly according to law, and then be included in the agenda. Li Yuan, a representative from the Zhejiang Area, proposed that the meeting schedule should be extended to allow sufficient time to handle proposals. Most representatives cited Article 53 of the rules of procedure, which stipulates that the agenda should be determined by the General Assembly before the election, advocating that the election should be moved back to be conducted after the proposals were discussed. Some representatives also advocated adding an agenda item that candidates should attend the General Assembly before the election to deliver campaign speeches. The Xinjiang representative, Wu Tiekuer, also made his first speech since the opening of the meeting, advocating that the constitutional amendment agenda should have a longer time. The head of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission also attended the General Assembly to report on the administration of border affairs. At 10:45 am, there was a recess, and at 11:10 am, the meeting continued. After Deputy Secretary-General Liu Dongyan read more than a dozen written opinions, Liu Huan (Mrs. Zhu Shaozhou), a representative of women's groups, stated that she was prepared to be hissed after speaking. She refuted the public opinion, pointing out that the audience had made resolutions beyond the scope of the constitution in a confused state, and the National Assembly was not a Political Participation Council and should not have routine administrative reports. Some of the audience immediately roared and hissed, trying to stop her from speaking by jeering. This move immediately aroused the anger of female representatives and some male representatives. With fair support, she was allowed by Chairman Xue to return to the podium to state her full opinions. The meeting adjourned in chaos at 12:00 noon.

### Bai Chongxi Calls on Everyone to Maintain Order

The meeting continued at 3:40 pm. Chairman Bai Chongxi reported on the Presidium's submission of a written opinion from female representative Zhang Sheng et al. requesting to guarantee female representatives' freedom of speech at the meeting. He then pointed out in his capacity as a representative: freedom of speech is the foundation of democratic politics, and he hoped that all colleagues would deeply understand this and abide by the rules of procedure, maintain order, and respect the right of every representative to speak, setting an example for the constitutional government of the country. Then, Deputy Secretary-General Liu Dongyan read the written opinions of the representatives on the draft agenda, which were generally the same as those put forward in the morning. After the reading, Gu Zhenggang, a representative from Guizhou, spoke, stating briefly: the opinions of the representatives in the morning meeting focused on two points, one was that before reviewing national affairs, they must listen to the administrative reports of government officials, and the other was the agenda for the election of the president and vice president should be arranged after the discussion and decision of the constitutional amendment. However, he believed that the review of national affairs should focus on the word "review" and should not be like the past Political Participation Council, suffering from the fatigue bombing of government officials. Although the National Assembly is the highest body of power for the people to exercise political power, in fact, part of the political power has been exercised by the Legislative Yuan. According to the constitution, the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan, and whether the administrative heads must accept the decision of the National Assembly is worth considering. He said: abiding by the law is democracy, and suppressing the rebellion and implementing the constitution are the most important national affairs. As for the order of the election and constitutional amendment agenda, he suggested that they should be carried out in coordination, and the conference should be closed by the 25th at the latest.

### "Delay Wastes" is Against the Goal of Suppressing the Rebellion

He believed that a one-day delay in the meeting would not only cause significant loss of national wealth, but also give the communist bandits an opportunity to make trouble. Now student unrest has risen again in Ping and Rong, and the resignation of the main responsible persons of local departments to attend the meeting is quite related. This is enough to prove that unnecessary delays and wastes are contrary to the goal of suppressing the rebellion. He suggested that the Presidium hold a meeting to integrate the opinions of the representatives, revise the agenda, and submit it to the General Assembly for decision after the break. This suggestion was agreed by the audience with applause, and Chairman Bai announced a break at 4:15 pm.

### Related Procedural Issues Have Been Resolved

The meeting continued at 4:40 pm. After Secretary-General Hong Guanyou read the revised draft, he reported the Presidium's summary of the five revised opinions: (1) The review of national affairs should be divided into three parts: military, economic, and political, after listening to the reports of government officials, and should be carried out for three days. The government will answer the various reviews on the fourth day. (2) The discussion agenda of the constitutional amendment should be moved before the election of the President and Vice President. (3) The nomination and announcement procedures for the President and Vice President candidates should be coordinated with the general agenda and carried out as early as possible in accordance with the law. (4) The deadline for proposals will be one week from today, until 12:00 noon on the 17th, but the constitutional amendment will be discussed in advance, so the deadline is also advanced to 12:00 noon on the 14th. (5) The meeting period will be extended by two days to the 24th. After the report, Hong explained Zhu Bingbiao's questioning about the nomination of the President and Vice President candidates, taking the date of the announcement as the deadline. Chairman Bai then put the revised draft to a vote. The voting machine was unprecedentedly bright, with 1,837 representatives present, and 1,817 in favor. The proposal was finally passed with the support of more than 98.9% of the attending representatives, so that the procedural issues related to the meeting were finally resolved 12 days after the opening. Finally, Liu Dongyan reported that the motion proposed by the Henan representatives, requesting that the government military authorities quickly send a large army to reinforce the Central Plains and ensure Zheng and Bian, had been ordered by the Presidium to be handled quickly by the Secretariat. The meeting was adjourned at 5:10 pm.

### Xinjiang National Assembly Delegate Speaks, Earns Warm Applause

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] The Xinjiang representative made his first speech at the National Assembly on the morning of the 10th. Wu Tiekuer, a representative from Hesh County and the current editor-in-chief of the Uyghur newspaper, delivered his speech in Uyghur, and Tu Leqian, a representative from Zhenyou County, served as the translator, raising two points. One was that the constitution is the foundation of democratic politics, and it is not easy for border compatriots to gather in Beijing, so there should be sufficient time for the discussion of constitutional amendment proposals. The other was that the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission should report to the General Assembly on the administration of border affairs. Although the central government also cares about Xinjiang, it still lacks preferential treatment to comfort the Xinjiang compatriots' loyalty to the country. He also emphasized: "Xinjiang is an important gateway to the northwest for the country. Without Xinjiang, there is no northwest, and without the northwest, there is no country." He ended his speech in warm applause.

They also presented the proposal of more than a thousand representatives and the specific methods proposed by Yu Bin et al. (already seen in this newspaper on the 9th). The Chairman stated that the issue of the attendance of signed representatives at the General Assembly could be accepted in principle, but the methods must be reasonable and legal and still need to be considered.

[Also] Following the signed representatives, the centrally nominated representatives are also brewing a proposal to the National Assembly, requesting the General Assembly to publicly elect social figures, invite responsible authorities, and representatives from both the nomination and signature sides to negotiate a proper solution outside the meeting, and suggest that the National Government submit it to the State Council for approval and submit it to the Legislative Yuan to formulate a temporary bill, so that the centrally nominated and signed representatives can all attend.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] General Fu Zuoyi, Commander-in-Chief of the North China Bandit Suppression, became the most popular hero in the National Assembly on the morning of the 10th.

After a meeting of the Presidium, it was decided that Bai Chongxi, as a representative, would first express his condolences when he communicated directly with Fu by wireless telephone on the evening of the 9th. Bai reported on the situation of the call on the morning of the 10th under the order of Chairman Xue Dubi, stating: Fu encountered danger while returning to Ping from Jining. The plane caught fire in the air, but thanks to the superb and skilled piloting, it was immediately forced to land, and he escaped safely and was not injured. In addition to asking Bai to thank the General Assembly for their concern, Fu briefly explained that the bandits in the Ping-Sui line battle adopted a wandering strategy, and the national army has made proper arrangements and there is no major problem. After Bai's report, Wang Jinwen, a representative from Liaoning, and Liu Yanfu, a representative from Hebei, gave enthusiastic speeches, praising the army led by Fu for its strict discipline, strong combat effectiveness, and care for the people, and it was uniformly loved by the people of the Northeast and North China. They still requested that a telegram of condolence be sent quickly in the name of the General Assembly. This opinion was unanimously applauded and approved by the audience, and the telegram was issued by the Secretariat at the end of the meeting. (Details of Fu's plane crash and the National Assembly's telegram of condolence are published on another page)

### National Assembly Diary: The Unfolding of the "Anti-Hissing Gate Struggle"

Female Representative Says: "We Are Representing the Wives of All of You Gentlemen to Speak, Please Do Not Give Disrespectful Hissing!"

[Our Newspaper Special] The situation at the meeting was like the weather, once sunny and then cloudy. Chairman Jiang said "Absolutely cannot make a fool of ourselves for the communist bandits", the words were still in our ears, but the General Assembly on the 10th caused another storm due to the agenda issue, and it has entered the lens of foreign reporters.

The chairman of the General Assembly this morning was the kind old man Xue Dubi, who felt quite tricky about controlling the chaotic meeting. The applause for consoling Fu Zuoyi had just ended, and the hissing condemning Representative Zhou Yanguang had begun. The fact that there were no policy reports on the agenda and that the election was placed before amending the constitution made the representatives unbearable. The speaker's request was roughly to continue with other policy reports first, then review and amend the constitution, and then hold the election. Although the constitution does not give the General Assembly the power of "reporting" and "review", the opinion of the public is to do so, and those who know what's going on are silent. Zhou Yanguang originally held the same view, only to blame him for poor speaking skills, which led to the problems. His original intention may have been "The report of Chairman Jiang is still not detailed enough," but what he said was "I am not satisfied with the report of Chairman Jiang." This sentence ignited the powder keg, and hissing broke out in the meeting place. Someone shouted "Don't let him speak," and someone shouted "Fight the communists," and the crowd surrounded the aisle. Zhou Yanguang in front of the microphone was frightened, Xue Dubi and Hong Lanyou strongly urged everyone to sit down, but the meeting was still a mess. It was easy to calm down, allowing Zhou Yanguang to have the opportunity to finish his revised opinion and explain the misunderstanding caused by the sentence just now, but before and after the break, the opinions of the speakers were almost the same, still requiring "reporting," "reviewing," and "amending the constitution" first, and finally holding the election. Representative Liu Huan, the wife of Zhu Shaozhou, did not reduce her courage because she was a woman. It was already 11:30, and her delicate voice came from the microphone: "I know my opinion will be hissed by everyone, but I hope you will wait until I finish speaking before hissing." She expressed her opposition, pointing out that "reporting" and "reviewing" exceeded the scope of the constitution, but her voice could not correct the wrongness, but instead caused rejection. When she only said a small part, hissing and shouting covered the entire meeting place. She was forced to step down, and then encouraged by the female representatives, she went back on the podium, and then stepped down again, several times like this. She finally spoke again, but the shouting upstairs and downstairs had drowned out her voice. Xue Dubi and Hong Lanyou's restraint was ineffective, and they let the chaos go on for ten minutes. News reporters scurried around, and Liu Huan became a good target for the camera. Although someone shouted "Say less," Liu Huan finally finished speaking what no one could hear before stepping down. Female representative Zhang Shengyi stood up and appealed in the posture of the weak, saying that the number of people represented by female representatives is larger, and their responsibilities are greater than those of male representatives. She hoped that they would not be given disrespectful hissing. Her conclusion was: "The speeches of female representatives are representing the speeches of your dearest wives." This caused laughter and applause in the whole audience, and the atmosphere was a little relaxed, but it was already the legal adjournment time. People seemed to calm down a little after getting vented. The situation was better when the meeting opened in the afternoon. Chairman Bai Chongxi attended the meeting in military uniform. Gu Zhenggang's speech was straightforward and comfortable. He hoped that the General Assembly could create a democratic and law-abiding style and advocated amending the constitution and holding elections at the same time. This was the only opinion in today's meeting that could make everyone unanimously support it. Only a representative upstairs objected, saying, "We must amend the constitution before the election, otherwise, after the election, the representatives will leave and there will not be enough legal number of people, and the constitution will not be able to be amended." However, this opinion could not stand the crowd's mood of seeking peace after a long period of chaos. Bai Chongxi announced that the Presidium would summarize everyone's opinions and submit a revised proposal, which was unanimously approved by everyone.

After the break, the new agenda was successfully passed. This was the achievement of the day. A storm brought about an agenda. Looking back at the General Assembly, it has been open for two full weeks. (April 10th in Nanjing)

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th Dispatch] Today's meeting can be said to be a kind of "anti-hissing struggle." "Democracy is a political system that allows opponents to speak fully." This call was only heard today, giving those who know it the feeling of "a voice in an empty valley."

This morning, the registration office for the representatives was particularly crowded. It turned out that the "Vice Chairman Sun's Election Committee for Vice President" was distributing free movie tickets for tomorrow morning, "Six Palaces of Powder and Rouge" at the Dahua Theater and "Red Sleeves Tilt the City" at the Xindu Theater.

This afternoon's meeting was the latest to start and the earliest to end, starting at 3:40 pm and adjourning at 5:10 pm, including a 15-minute break.

Some people predict that the vice-presidential election will have to go through three rounds of voting, eliminating and eliminating before a decision can be made, because based on the current situation, no vice-presidential candidate can get more than half of the votes in the first round.

### Sunday Forum Explaining the Land Reform Plan and Answering Mr. Wu Jingchao, et al.

— Xiao Zheng

Since the Chinese Land Reform Association announced the land reform plan, newspapers and magazines at home and abroad have praised it and offered advice, for which we are deeply grateful. In particular, Mr. Wu Jingchao's article "Critique of the Land Reform Plan" in the Nanjing Central Daily News raised relatively clear questions. Letters from friends also frequently inquired about the doubts raised by Mr. Wu. I hereby respectfully provide the following answers to the main points of the original plan:

(1) The main purpose of this plan is to solve the most serious problem of tenant farmers demanding land in China in the most clear and concise way. The tenant farming system is the most common and most harmful system in China. It not only impoverishes the majority of farmers, but also gradually reduces the yield of the land. In view of the fact that the previous plan of "taxing away landlords" was not a quick fix, and the method of "buying away landlords" by issuing bonds was too slow and difficult to achieve significant results, the Association, after several discussions, decided to recommend a simple and effective method. That is, according to the bill based on this plan, if adopted by the government, on the day the bill is promulgated, the tenant-farmed land will be unconditionally transferred to the tenant farmers. This will save many roundabout methods of bargaining. Moreover, it is prepared to supplement that the landlords' hired farmhands should also unconditionally obtain the land they cultivate.

(2) In order to show that the land truly belongs to the farmers on the day the bill is enacted, the land tax must be borne by the farmers. Because the land tax is the obligation of the landowner to the state, if the land tax is still paid by the original landlord, it indicates that the land still does not belong to the farmers, and this plan loses its value. In order to ensure that the farmers are guaranteed in spirit and in law that the land is theirs, the farmers must bear the responsibility of paying this tax. Conversely, in order to let the original landlord know that from the day the bill is enacted, he has transferred the land to the farmers, he must immediately be relieved of his tax obligations. No matter how the land price is repaid, or when it is fully repaid, the land will always belong to the farmers. Only then will the farmers be spiritually liberated, cherish the land from now on, and work diligently. Only then will the production of farmland change from a gradually decreasing trend to an increasing one.

(3) Farmers are realistic. If you say that the land will be given to you after seven years, but you still have to pay rent for seven years, the farmers are not interested. Because farmers know that in the long seven years, the government may change its mind, and the landlord can also take the opportunity to overwhelm him with power. If the landlord pays taxes as usual and the farmers pay rent as usual, it is equivalent to no change in the status quo, but only a empty promise of giving land after seven years. That cannot be considered an action.

(4) Since the farmers have to bear the tax, they will no longer be able to repay the land price at the original rent rate. The reason why we set the land price at seven times the rent is because, according to all investigations, the general land price is seven "purchase years." However, it is impossible for farmers to pay seven years' rent all at once, even if they are still asked to pay it in seven years and not be taxed. Farmers will not be interested either. Because there is still no improvement in the farmers' lives today. We certainly want to give farmers spiritual encouragement. But more practically, it is to give farmers practical benefits to improve their lives. Therefore, even if the farmers are not taxed, these seven years' rent must be repaid in fourteen years. Many gentlemen misunderstood that we were only giving the farmers land after fourteen years. This is probably a problem of unclear wording. We advocate immediately transferring the land to the farmers, so it is explained in the second chapter of the plan. As for the repayment period of the land price, it is more beneficial to the farmers the longer it is. The more years it is divided into, the smaller the annual burden is. This is very obvious. We want to show that the land belongs to the farmers from now on, and we want them to bear the land tax from now on. At the same time, we want the farmers to practically calculate that the annual land price repayment, plus the land tax, is also lighter than the current rent. Only then will it have practical significance. Therefore, we stipulate that the land price will be repaid in fourteen years.

(5) So how do we plan for the landlords? To be honest, all land reform plans have no reason to plan for the landlords. But we are a country with many small landlords, and the landlords' livelihood must be considered a little. Therefore, we do not adopt the method of repaying the land in scores of years used by Western European countries. We advocate fourteen years, that is, each year the landlord still receives half of the total land price equal to the rent. But he is exempted from the tax burden. According to many investigations, now all actual levies and borrowings combined, in heavy areas, the landlord also has to pay half of the rent. In light areas, it is also about one-third. But now the landlord cannot really collect enough rent. According to our method, we guarantee that the landlord will receive half of the rent amount in land price for fourteen years, and will not have to pay taxes. It is also equivalent to guaranteeing the landlord's livelihood for fourteen years. If China is stable and progressing from now on, and is industrialized, the landlords will not have to worry about a way to make a living after fourteen years. Even the small landlords with orphans and widows will have fourteen years of net rent income, their lives are guaranteed, and they can also have a way out in the future. Otherwise, if the landlords still insist on protecting their vested interests and are unwilling to take this path of peaceful reform, I am afraid that one day, it will not be possible to protect the safety of their lives. Isn't the peasant rebellion led by the Communist Party an obvious fact? Therefore, after the Association's plan was announced, many enlightened landlords sent letters expressing their support, and said that they could not collect the rent now, but the land tax burden was very heavy. They said that our method was to liberate them.

(6) For the government's sake: No matter how heavy the actual levy is now, the actual collection does not reach one-thirtieth of the national agricultural products. This is because there are too many problems with the tax collection, and the system and calculation methods are too difficult, such as converting taels to yuan and converting yuan to actual objects. This set is still a continuation of the land tax of the former Qing Dynasty, which only facilitates the corruption of the middlemen. We, like Mr. Wu Jingchao, hope that the government will clean up the tax system in one fell swoop. In this transitional period, it is happy to say that 10% of the land's normal crop yield will be collected. The one-tenth tax is an ancient system in China, and farmers have faith in it. Each county should determine a grade for the amount of crop yield for upper, middle, and lower fields, and the government will levy taxes accordingly; and re-stipulate the standard for the division of central and local governments, and absolutely prohibit adding any apportionment to the land. Chinese farmers are the most honest and obedient, and they will never evade reasonable and legal taxes. In the past, first, the tax system was chaotic, and second, the landlords owed and evaded taxes in various ways, so the government's tax revenue was usually "the actual collection did not reach half of the "nominal collection." If we follow our method, plus the collective tax payment organization, the government's tax revenue must increase several times, and all apportionments can be cancelled without worrying about no way to cover expenditures. Mr. Wu Jingchao is worried that the farmers will get land and increase the apportionment. If the government reforms the land, but is unwilling to handle these simple and easy tax reforms, how can such a government implement land reform?

(7) Finally, Mr. Wu and many other newspapers believe that it is not enough for farmers to only obtain these small plots of land to solve the problem. We have heard this argument often. But today's China must first solve today's problems, and then talk about the perfect plan for tomorrow. If we only think about the perfect plan for tomorrow and are unwilling to solve today's survival problems, then it is really like drawing a cake to satisfy hunger, which is of no practical help. Our first step is to give farmers land, and then we will gradually merge fields, increase harvests, and even gradually implement the large farm system. We need to enable too many farmers to switch to industry and commerce, so that farmers can get more land on average. But this matter cannot be resolved unless the country is stable and the economy embarks on the road to industrialization. This is the time to "rescue the dying without delay." How can we solve the problem with those empty plans? We are willing to "be humble and have no lofty arguments" and solve the realistic problems. We hope that all wise people can recognize the seriousness of China's problems today and unanimously advocate solving the peasant problem first to seek China's stability. All further construction plans should wait until China escapes the threat of death.

As for Mr. Wu's words, it seems that there are not many tenant farmers in the northern provinces, and this plan does not really solve the problem. I would like to add that this plan is not a panacea. It can solve all problems. But it is indeed seeking a reasonable solution for the most important part of China's problems first. There are not many tenant farmers in the northern provinces, but the problem of these few tenant farmers demanding land has brewed such a big disaster of the Communist Party's rebellion. Social rebellion does not really require everyone to rise up. If 20% of the people rebel, the remaining 80% will have to follow. Moreover, about 20% of the tenant farmers is a large enough number. The Communist Party is very clever and can grasp "land reform" as the main basis for rebellion. Otherwise, why doesn't the Communist Party take other issues? What does Mr. Wu think?

According to statistics, from June last year to March this year, the export amount was more than 1 billion yuan, with camphor accounting for the majority, and the import amount was 1.4 billion yuan, with food and fertilizers accounting for the majority. The supply of materials was 1.3 billion yuan (all in Taiwan dollars). Mr. Ma emphasized the misunderstanding of the mainland regarding the transportation and sale of materials from Taiwan.

Therefore, there are still seven kinds of materials that are currently prohibited from exporting commercially: grain, alcohol, timber, camphor, coal, hardware, and fertilizer. As for camphor, tea, and pineapple, which are relied upon to exchange for foreign exchange, they have not been sold well due to the impact of international market competition. The committee currently holds 400 tons of camphor, 120,000 boxes of pineapple, and 2.4 million pounds of tea to be sold. As for what this province urgently needs to import now, it is fertilizer, cloth, flour, and wheat.

### The Legend of General Fu Zuoyi's Plane Crash

[Our Newspaper Beiping Aeronautical Dispatch, 7th] At the beginning of the month, when Nie Rongzhen's 16th and 2nd Columns turned westward from Chahar South, the winds of war rose in Sui East and Sui South. Fu Zuoyi immediately flew back to Suiyuan to deploy everything. On the 4th, the National Army was already concentrated in Guisui and Jining. Fu Zuoyi boarded a plane to return east, and disembarked briefly at Jining. After convening the newly appointed 35th Army Commander Guo Jingyun and others to instruct them on matters, he boarded the plane and took off again. When the plane left the runway and rose to a height of one room, General Fu walked into the iron door of the cockpit and ordered the pilot to "fly to Beiping." As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly fell to the door of the cockpit. It turned out that one of the plane's engines had caught fire. Although the pilot calmly shut off the throttle and made an almost right-angle emergency turn to descend, the fuselage had lost its balance and fell from the air into the fields. Only one wheel touched the ground upon landing, and it immediately overturned. The fuselage suddenly shook, and everyone inside the plane fell and passed out. Only one person, half-conscious and half-dazed, groped for the door, but could not open it.

Commander Guo Chases the Crashed Plane

When the ascending plane tilted sharply, Commander Guo Jingyun, who was seeing him off at the airfield, saw that the situation was bad and immediately chased after the plane in a jeep. When he arrived at the fallen field, he opened the door from the outside and saw General Fu's head falling into the cockpit and his feet stretching into the cabin. He was still unconscious. Fortunately, when the plane initially tilted, he was standing and talking to the driver, so he was the first to fall.

No Severe Shaking, Only Surface Scratches

He was not subjected to the severe shaking of the later landing and overturning, so only his back had some minor scratches. The other attendants were more seriously injured. Commander Guo led people to carry the people on the plane off the plane for more than ten minutes before the unconscious gradually woke up. As for the plane, one minute after the people on the plane were carried off, the fuel tank exploded and the entire fuselage was burned. If it had been a minute later, all rescue would have been useless. It is said that when the plane was taking Fu from Zhangfei to Suiyuan, the engine had already been making unusual noises. After some repairs in Guisui, it had improved, but who knew it would eventually crash in Jining?

Liu Yongsheng Treated in Guisui

Liu Yongsheng, deputy director of the operations office, and Captain Zhang of the guard team, who were most trusted by General Fu and always accompanied him, were more seriously injured and are now being treated in Guisui. General Fu flew back to the capital on the 5th on a plane newly dispatched from Beiping. Chiefs from military and political circles all went to the western suburbs to express their condolences. Fu's injuries were indeed very light, and he could already pick up a newspaper and read it with his arm. (Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Jianfu)

Escape Can Be Called a Miracle

[Central News Agency Guisui, 10th] The escape of General Fu Zuoyi from the plane crash in Jining on the 4th can be called a major miracle in history. According to eyewitnesses, Fu Zuoyi arrived in Jining by special plane at noon on the 4th, accompanied by staff members Zhi Renjie, adjutant Zhang Jingtao, etc. He immediately convened a military conference of senior generals. At 1:45 PM, he took off in the original plane, rising extremely quickly. Before reaching 200 meters, the tail of the plane caught fire. At that time, Fu was walking into the cockpit to tell the pilot to fly directly to Beiping, originally scheduled to fly to Zhangyuan. The plane crashed at this time in a hollow between two high hills. If it had deviated to the left or right, there would have been no way to escape. The plane landed sideways, so the wings were destroyed and the door faced the sky. Zhi Renjie hurriedly pulled the door, but could not open it. Zhang Jingtao was strong and powerful, and rushed forward to pull it open, but his arm was seriously injured. When the plane crashed, Fu had just left the cockpit and had not yet sat down, so he was knocked down and lost consciousness. The pilot and attendants carried him out of the cabin, but the cabin was filled with smoke and difficult to breathe. The moment Fu and all the personnel left the fuselage, the fuselage exploded with a loud noise and was completely destroyed. Everyone saw that Fu was covered in blood and unconscious, so they immediately rescued him. He soon woke up and asked what happened. He was told that the plane had been evacuated. Upon examining the blood on his body, it was discovered that the electrician in the plane had knocked out all his teeth, and was lying on Fu's body in the cabin, and all the bloodstains were from the electrician's mouth.

Normal Office Hours on the Afternoon of the 5th

When Fu took off, he forbade senior generals from seeing him off. When the police at the airfield issued a report, the senior generals rushed to the airfield, and Fu had already returned by the airfield car. On the way, he encountered a wounded soldier, and ordered the car to stop and take care of him. That night, he rested at the Jining Garrison Headquarters. The next morning, he took another plane back to Beiping. In the afternoon of the 5th, someone in Beiping received the news and went to the Bandit Suppression Headquarters to visit, and Fu was already working as usual. This time, all the personnel on the plane were unharmed except for Deputy Adjutant Zhang Jingtao, who was injured and sent to the hospital. Fu only had a scratch on his forehead and a slight bruise on his left hip. After a doctor's examination, everything inside was normal.

Miraculous Escape Is Amazing

This is the third time that Fu has escaped from a plane crash. The first time was after the Xi'an Incident, when he took off from Suiyuan at night to rescue Chairman Chiang and got lost, and was forced to land in the mountains of Yixian, Hebei. Both the people and the plane were safe. The second time was in the autumn of the year before last, when he flew from Suiyuan to the sky over Liangcheng and experienced a malfunction. He urgently returned to Suiyuan and landed. After leaving the plane, the fuselage was burned. The wreckage of the plane is still parked at the Suiyuan airfield.

National Assembly Sends Telegram to Console Commander-in-Chief Fu

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 10th] The National Assembly representatives were very concerned when they learned that Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters had been slightly injured in a plane crash. Today, they decided to send a telegram to Commander-in-Chief Fu on behalf of the Assembly to express their condolences. The original telegram is as follows: "To Commander-in-Chief Fu of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters in Beiping: You, sir, with your great talent for strategy, have been entrusted with the important task of a thousand cities. Your suppression of the rebellion has been outstanding. Every time we hear of your victories, we are deeply admired. The Assembly has decided to express its condolences. We hope that you will achieve complete success soon and stabilize the country. We respectfully inform you, and respectfully request your consideration. The National Assembly, Mao (April), Zheng (10th)."

### Lanzhou Exercises Civil Rights, Setting a National Precedent. Senator Wang Curying Was Impeached by Vote Yesterday

[Central News Agency Lanzhou, 10th] The case of the free professional groups here voting to impeach City Senator Wang Zhongying, which set a national precedent for the people to exercise the right of recall, was held today. The result was that more than two-thirds of the members voted to complete the impeachment procedure. According to reports, Wang Zhongying, as a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, was selected as a city senator of the Lanzhou Free Professional Group through a lottery. In previous meetings, he never sought the opinions of the groups he represented, nor did he speak or propose a case for the groups he represented. Moreover, he relied on his identity as a senator to forcibly occupy public property, coerce nuns, and falsely accuse merchants. Earlier, more than 200 members of the News Reporter and Western Medicine Doctor Associations jointly signed a petition to impeach Wang Zhongying on the grounds that he was incompetent and had poor behavior. Today, they completed the voting procedure according to law. On the eve of the country's constitutional government, this advocacy of the people exercising the right to recall in addition to the right to elect has great significance for the future of democratic politics.

### Riot in Downtown Bogota, Situation Confused, Revolution Suddenly Breaks Out in Colombia. President Velez Is Negotiating with the Left-Wing Opposition Party. Pan-American Conference Suspended, Marshall and Others Are Safe.

[United Press Washington, 10th] The bloody rebellion of the Colombian left-wing against the conservative government had not yet revealed its trend by dawn on the 10th. At the same time, mobs continued to flood the Colombian capital of Bogota. International wireless communication with the area ended on the evening of the 9th. The only direct source of information on this question is the State Department's report, which states that the Colombian capital has become a scene of carnage. US Ambassador Butler reported to Secretary of State Marshall that Commerce Secretary Harriman and other Americans "are safe, but exhausted." The fire outside the embassy has been contained. The State Department has received eyewitness accounts stating that the rebels did not encounter resistance from government forces. The delegates attending the Pan-American Conference were unharmed, but due to the looting of food, the delegates and more than 420,000 residents are feeling panicked about food supplies. Two or three American journalists reported eyewitness accounts stating that the riots showed no signs of abating. Delegates attending the conference have apparently decided to continue the conference in that location or elsewhere. American journalists believe the location will be moved elsewhere. Marshall has not yet indicated that he will lead the delegation back to the United States, and it is expected that he will try to keep the conference going. Colombian Vice President Santos, who is currently in New York, said that President Velez and opposition Liberal leaders are discussing solutions, "possibly on the premise of the president's resignation." He also said that 30 people died in the rebellion. Santos said that the best solution would be to expand the government to include Liberal figures. Colombian Chief Representative to the United Nations Lopez confirmed that Velez was still in power late on the 9th and was consulting with the opposition.

[United Press Washington, 9th] Secretary of State Marshall is now staying outside the Colombian capital, waiting for the situation to unfold.

[United Press Washington, 10th] The Colombian capital of Bogota was shrouded in a state of uneasy silence on the 10th. The anti-government left-wing rebellion has declared a reduction in momentum, but the outcome is still uncertain. The fires set by the mobs are still smoldering, but there is no one in the middle of the streets. The military police have disappeared from the streets, abandoning control of the situation, and it is believed that the army is concentrated in the presidential palace to defend President Velez.

[Reuters Bogota, 10th] After the Colombian Liberal Party launched a revolution to seize the government radio station in an attempt to overthrow President Velez and his government, the conservative government of Velez seemed to have regained control of the capital today. Velez issued a communiqué at 1:20 AM standard time on the 10th, broadcasting on the regained radio station that the assassinated Liberal leader Gaitan was apparently harmed by pro-Communist elements. He also said: "Although there are still minor skirmishes and riots in the city, the army is able to grasp the situation, and the government has also taken measures to restore order." The building where the Pan-American Conference was being held was also stormed by mobs, and the conference was suspended. Post-劫 Bogota is like London after the German bombing. The radio station, which was previously in the hands of the rebels, announced that the Liberal Party-appointed interim president Escandara had entered the presidential palace in an attempt to force Velez to resign. Communist Party member Baria, a Bogota local advisor to the General Confederation of Labor, also ordered supporters of the Liberal Party to go to the streets with weapons or any iron objects to participate in the revolution. The US Consul in Cali, Colombia's third largest city, reported that the revolutionaries, with the support of army and police personnel, had taken control of the city of Cali. According to broadcasts from the revolutionary side, clashes with conservatives occurred when the government radio station was taken over, and four people from the Liberal side and students died. At the National Congress Building, where the Pan-American Conference was being held, conservative police fired intermittently at the crowd.

[Agence France-Presse Bogota, 10th] Colombian President Velez issued a communiqué on the 10th stating that the unrest was instigated by the Communist Party. The President called on the Colombian people to take united action to fight totalitarianism. At the same time, the Liberal Party headquarters issued a declaration stating that the Liberal Party will no longer persuade Velez to resign as president, and will call on the people to launch an armed uprising in order to achieve the success of the revolution.

### Liberal Party Leader Gaitan Assassinated, Major Cause of Riots in Bogota. Three Major Government Figures Killed by the People.

[United Press Colombia Capital, 9th] Colombia today experienced a revolution, government offices were occupied, and a new government has been established. At least eight people were killed when armed civilians rose up in the capital, including one current government minister. The trigger for the revolution was the assassination of opposition Liberal Party leader and 1950 presidential candidate Gaitan last night. As soon as this news spread, the people were outraged and rushed to the streets with various weapons, smashing glass doors and windows, and the entire city was in chaos.

Armed crowds swarmed to the presidential palace, shouting "Kill Gomez!" Gomez is the leader of the Conservative Party of the government faction and is currently the head of the Colombian delegation to the Pan-American Conference. The assassin who shot Gaitan was also killed by the crowd, dragged to the front of the presidential palace, and dismembered to vent their anger. Most of the military police apparently agreed with the revolutionary masses, and only those loyal to the current President Velez fired at those attempting to break into the presidential palace. Armed crowds then occupied the radio station and broadcast in the name of the Liberal Party Revolutionary Committee, stating that the Liberal Party had taken over the government and controlled everything. Dr. Escandara has taken office as interim president, pending the arrival of Liberal Vice President Santos in the capital. Gaitan was shot on a street near his office, sent to the hospital, and underwent surgery to save his life. An hour later, he died of his injuries. Upon hearing the news, about 1,000 people quickly rushed to the National Congress Building, smashing windows, destroying furniture, and setting fire to several houses. The guards were outnumbered and apparently unwilling to interfere. The National Congress Building is where the current Pan-American Conference is being held. Gunfire could be heard in the square in front of the door, and the reception room was also affected by the chaos. News reporters went to great lengths to get out. The masses then marched towards the presidential palace. Afterwards, the army arrived, but hesitated because the masses shouted "Long live Colombia! Long live the people!" In the end, they remained still. At that time, Gomez, Minister of Mines Montiel, and another Conservative Party leader Valencia had been killed.

### Hoffman Collects Supplies to Meet the Urgent Needs of Five European Countries

### US House Military Subcommittee Drafts Conscription Law

Advocates Recruiting 1.9 Million

[Reuters Washington, 9th] The draft conscription law drafted by the House Military Subcommittee was released today, proposing to mobilize 1,944,000 people to join the armed forces. All men between the ages of 18 and 31 should be drafted. The number of people assigned to each military branch is as follows: Army: 700,028, Navy: 550,000, Marine Corps: 110,000, Air Force: 502,000.

### South Korean General Election Registration Reaches 8 Million

[United Press Agency Seoul, 10th] Officials said today that nearly 8 million people in southern Korea have registered to vote in the May 10 general election.

### Joint Air Force Maneuvers by Italy, France, and the United States. Government Able to Maintain Order During Italian General Election.

[Agence France-Presse Milan, 9th] Today, aircraft from Italy, France, and the United States held joint aerial maneuvers. The aircraft took off from airfields in Italy and France and flew around the Mediterranean Sea between Corsica and Liguria, pretending that an American flying fortress had fallen there. Before returning to their respective bases, the aircraft made patrol flights.

[United Press Rome, 9th] The Italian government said on the 9th that the most critical period in Italy will come immediately after the national election on April 18, but added that the military police are now ready and even airborne troops have been ordered to deal with any situation. Deputy Prime Minister Bachiati held a special meeting and assured the country that the election would be absolutely free and peaceful. He said, "The government has planned far ahead to ensure freedom of voting and public order before, during, and after the election. The government's preparations can be said to be perfect. Even in the most remote areas where it is extremely difficult for the military police to reach, the most subtle problems will be addressed with all our efforts." Since the start of the election campaign, there have been 200 political gatherings disrupted due to poor order, 13 people have been killed in political assassinations, and 64 others have been hospitalized due to injuries. The Election Truce Commission is meeting in this atmosphere. Communist leader Togliatti chaired the passage of a resolution at the meeting, calling on the country to accept the results of the election with a "calm and peaceful" attitude, in order to show that "Italy is ready to accept the test of democracy." Italians had previously worried that if the left-wing front failed, the Communist Party might take direct action. Togliatti's remarks have slightly dispelled the haze.

### U Su et al. National Funeral Today

[Reuters Yangon, 10th] The bodies of former Burmese Prime Minister U Su and the other six cabinet members who were killed at the same time will be buried on the 11th. The procession will be led by the Burmese Defense Force, and aircraft will soar in the sky. The day has also been declared a national mourning day.

### South National Air Routes

All Suspended for Unknown Reasons

[United Press London, 10th] Well-informed sources here said last night that domestic air routes in Yugoslavia have been suspended entirely since Monday for unknown reasons.

### Western Countries Compromise; Berlin Situation Tends Towards Relaxation; Britain Agrees Crash Investigation to be Conducted by Involved Nations

[Reuters, Berlin, 9th] Allied observers believe the Western powers have already decided to ease the tension in Berlin. This can be seen in the decision by the four powers not to convene the Four-Power Allied Control Council meeting on April 10th, the conciliatory tone in the letter from British Commander Robertson to Soviet Commander Sokolovsky regarding the plane crash, and Robertson's agreement that the crash investigation should be conducted by Britain and the Soviet Union, rather than all four powers.

As for Britain, Robertson's speech in Düsseldorf, while promoting the organization of a new political structure to allow West Germany to be incorporated into Western Europe, also showed Britain taking a less provocative attitude towards the Berlin crisis than the United States. Britain did not announce a large-scale airlift system after the Soviet Union tightened control over land transportation, and the armed guards sent by the Soviet army to the British sector radio station in Berlin were not expelled by the British. British officials believe that if a break with the Soviet Union over German political issues is to occur, it should not be caused by dangerous events and an atmosphere of alarming rumors.

[United Press, Berlin, 10th] British Commander Robertson today submitted a reply to the Soviet authorities, abandoning the demand for a four-nation investigation into the British-Soviet plane crash and accepting the Soviet suggestion for a joint British-Soviet investigation. The reply did not mention sending fighter jets to protect flights, but only stated that British aircraft had been instructed to strictly adhere to aviation regulations. When the special envoy delivered the reply to the Soviet headquarters, Sokolovsky was not in Berlin. Some observers speculate that he may have been summoned back to his country to consult with the government given the tense four-power relations in Berlin.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 9th] British reporters here commenting on the content of Robertson's note said, "It seems to have been written in Sokolovsky's office." American reporters also commented, "Britain is definitely on a downward slope."

### Proposal to Facilitate News Transmission Approved

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 9th] The First Committee of the United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information discussed this afternoon the draft proposal submitted by the Chinese delegation regarding various conveniences for the transmission and dissemination of news. After a detailed explanation by Zhang Pengchun, the chief representative of China, it was unanimously approved by the committee without amendment. The text of the recommendation is as follows: "The First Committee, in considering that the freedom of information in various countries can be fully realized, hereby adopts the following recommendation as an article of the General Assembly treaty, namely, that all countries should cooperate in supplying and improving various tools to facilitate the transmission and dissemination of news."

[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 9th] The Second Subcommittee of the Conference on Freedom of Information, by a vote of twenty-two to one (Belgium), passed the proposal of the Chinese delegate Zhang Pengchun, asserting that foreign journalists have complete freedom to send news abroad, but foreign news agencies may not publish local news without the consent of local news agencies and local newspapers.

### Soviet Troops Gather in German Territory; Preparations Underway for Spring Exercises

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 9th] Newspapers licensed by France reported that spring exercises were about to be held in the Soviet occupation zone, and a large number of Soviet troops were gathering in Brandenburg. Dance halls, hotels, and cafes in the area have been requisitioned. The same situation has occurred in several cities in Saxony. Soviet air force units have been conducting training south of Berlin in Zossen and practicing parachuting daily. These facts all prove that the Soviet Union's troop training is on a large scale.

### British-Made Automatic Tricycle to be Sold in the Far East

[British Information Services, London, 10th] A British company will soon export newly invented automatic rickshaws to the Far East for sale. These vehicles are streamlined sedan-style, with a canopy for two people to sit together. The driver's seat is located on a separate rear wheel. The vehicle is equipped with an engine that can travel 20 miles per hour, and one gallon of gasoline can travel 90 miles.

### Luang Phibuns Reclaims Power; Appointed New Prime Minister of Siam

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 10th, United Press] The order appointing Phibuns as the new Prime Minister of Siam has been issued. After his appointment was announced, Luang Phibuns stated that his cabinet is expected to include seven members of the former Nai Khuang Aphaiwong cabinet. Luang stated that the Nai Khuang government "was ineffective," so he requested him to resign within 24 hours. Luang stated that he would not invite former Prime Minister Luang Thamrong to participate in the new cabinet and would not invite Nai Pridi Banomyong to return to Bangkok. Luang signed a treaty with the Japanese government during the war and was often accused of being an enemy collaborator. The military group he led launched a coup in November of last year and then supported Nai Khuang as Prime Minister.

### Britain, America, and France Invite Soviet Union to Participate in Discussion of Returning Trieste to Italy; Paris Conference Scheduled for May

[Reuters, London, 9th] Britain today sent a note to the Soviet Union, formally inviting the Soviet Union to participate in preliminary talks in Paris next month with major related countries to discuss the return of Trieste to Italy. The note also urged the Soviet Union to agree as soon as possible to the proposal made by Britain, America, and France on March 20 to return Trieste to Italy. At the same time, the British government sent a note to the Italian Ambassador to Britain, informing them of the suggestions Britain had just made to the Soviet Union. The Yugoslav Ambassador to Britain also received the same notification.

In addition, the United States and France have also sent similar notes to the Soviet Union.

[Reuters, Washington, 9th] The State Department has confirmed that the US military authorities in Trieste are transferring some of their powers to the Italians. A department spokesman stated that this move is the same as the policy in other US-occupied areas, and he denied that the United States intended to withdraw its troops from Trieste.

(15) The Crisis in Southeastern China

In 1944, Japan opened up a mainland corridor from south to north in China, thereby connecting Manchuria with the conquered areas of Southeast Asia—Indochina, Siam, Malaya, and Burma—via a transportation line.

Now, from a historical perspective, this effort was merely a death throe of a mortally wounded enemy, but at the time, it almost liquidated the resistance of the Chinese National Government and the investments made by the United States over three years under Sino-American wartime cooperation.

No effective plan was developed to counter this offensive. The only forces available were the small 14th Air Force, the fledgling Chinese Air Force, and the Chinese army, which had never received a single ton of American aid; even if there was some aid later, it was too late.

In February 1944, when I first warned General Stilwell of the enemy's threat, I requested 8,000 tons of fuel, ammunition, and other supplies in March for Sino-American aircraft, but I actually received less than half of that amount.

In mid-April, just before the offensive was launched, I protested that this delivery method would not allow for the storage of materials, and it would bring to a halt our increasingly effective attacks on Japanese ships, airfields, and transportation lines.

At that time, the attacks on Japanese ships had already passed the experimental stage. Approximately 56,900 tons of enemy merchant ships and two gunboats had been sunk, of which 16,700 tons were sunk by the 14th Air Force in January alone. We had hopes of sinking at least 150,000 tons of Japanese ships per month. At the same time, B-24 aircraft equipped with radar were preparing to sweep the China Sea as far as the Philippines.

However, the restrictions on cargo tonnage that I have pointed out above made it impossible to stockpile the supplies necessary to support the Chinese army in preventing the impending Japanese offensive. I argued strongly that the enemy's offensive would threaten the safety of the entire Free China, including the B-29 bases then nearing completion near Chengdu in Sichuan Province. The air defense of the Superfortress bases was entirely entrusted to the 14th Air Force under my command.

Stilwell's first response was to say that the Joint Chiefs of Staff did not give me priority for Hump supplies because the Japanese expedition in Burma still threatened Imphal and the Hump air transport base in the Brahmaputra Valley of India. The fact was that Stilwell's Burma operations required a large number of supplies from the Hump.

Stilwell told me that air force activities within China should only be reduced.

Past records will show that my predictions regarding the nature of the Japanese offensive were quite accurate. The latter was launched in April in the Yellow River region of Henan Province, and in the following month, it was launched again in Hunan Province on the south bank of the Yangtze River.

Because the 8,000 tons I requested for March had been cut by nearly half, and the request for April had been cut almost as severely, I suggested that the April quantity be restored first, with at least 8,000 tons for May, and then increasing to 8,000 tons per month thereafter.

In addition, I proposed an alternative: temporarily allocate the fuel stockpiled near Chengdu for B-29 use, and if future emergencies required it, replace the B-29's planned attacks on the areas surrounding China with strategic attacks within China.

I frankly told General Stilwell that unless action was taken in accordance with one of the above methods, then it would be necessary to notify Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek that he could no longer rely on our air force to provide effective support for his troops, and also to notify Washington that the security of the entire China was seriously affected.

Stilwell's reply was still that the crisis within India made it impossible to improve Hump air transport and increase supplies to China, and Chiang Kai-shek should not expect the 14th Air Force to do the impossible. However, after this exchange of views, I received one of the strangest orders I had received since taking office as the senior American Air Force officer in China.

This order made defending the Chengdu area the top priority of the 14th Air Force, even at the expense of abandoning attacks on enemy ships and support for Chinese ground troops, even though the Chinese ground troops were facing their greatest test at the time.

The order was sent in the form of a letter from General Stratemeyer, commander of the U.S. Air Force in the India-Burma Theater of the China-Burma-India Theater, but the letter stated that Stilwell also held the same view.

The ostensible reason for this directive was that I had expressed doubts about our ability to defend the B-29 bases, whereas what I actually needed to raise was the security of the entire China. I never raised the question of defense of the Chengdu base alone.

At that time, the 14th Air Force headquarters in Kunming and the main Chinese terminus of the Hump route were being defended by a fighter squadron, while two squadrons of fighters were defending Chengdu, so the defense of Chengdu was stronger than that of Kunming.

Historically, the main task of the 14th Air Force has been to defend the air terminus of the Hump route in China and to support Chinese ground troops in the air. I was forced to point this out to Stilwell, hoping he would not tie my hands with contrary orders.

I assured him that the air defense of the Chengdu area was child's play compared to helping stop the Japanese offensive then underway in Henan and preparing to support the Chinese Expeditionary Force, which would soon cross the Salween River into Burma.

It is worth mentioning that the most elite troops in China at that time, namely the Salween River Expeditionary Force, were about to engage in operations outside of China under Stilwell's pressure, while the Japanese army had already begun to cut off southeastern China!

When the crisis in China broke out, Stilwell and Stratemeyer were talking about the air defense of the Chengdu area alone, a problem that did not actually exist. Stilwell finally dropped the matter, implying that I had been making unnecessary noise before.

He spent some time somewhere in Burma. There he sent a radio telegram in which he said sarcastically that he found the air defense problem in Chengdu did not exist, "which was quite comforting." This seemed to please him very much, as he remained inactive on the Chinese crisis until months later, by which time the fate of eastern China had been sealed.

### Communist Bandits Conspire to Launch Full-Scale Student Unrest; Arrested Jinan University Student Provides Detailed Inside Information; Party, Government, and Military Hold Joint Meeting for Detailed Discussion

[Report from our newspaper] Regarding the matter of Communist bandits planning to launch full-scale student unrest in this city, a joint meeting of the party, government, and military of this city was solemnly held yesterday afternoon in the city hall auditorium. The meeting was personally presided over by Mayor Wu. In addition to key figures from the party, government, and military, presidents of colleges and universities in the city were also invited to attend to conduct a thorough discussion of the student unrest issue. The meeting lasted from 3:30 PM to around 7:00 PM, and the contents were kept confidential.

According to a statement released yesterday by the city government's news office, the situation of the student conflict at National Jinan University has already been reported by various newspapers. The following is the truth of the matter according to a statement released by the police department: On the afternoon of the 8th of this month, students at the school posted a public notice exposing that the purpose of a trip to Hangzhou by a small number of students to enjoy the spring was to publicly commemorate Yu Zisan, launch student unrest, and respond to the Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu's conspiracy to cross the Yangtze River on the 5th. The students who traveled to Hangzhou found out about this and tore down the notice, posting another notice in its place with wanton insults. As a result, a fight broke out. Student Tian Ganwu was seriously injured in the fight. On the afternoon of the 9th, students at the school were indignant because student Tian Ganwu was injured by the students who traveled to Hangzhou, and another fight broke out. Students Wang Zongshu and Yin Zhenmin were also injured. It was also discovered that student Wang Zongyi was a Communist bandit cadre, and Cui Weijie (female) was strongly suspected of being a Communist bandit. That evening, they were sent to the North Station Police Sub-bureau for interrogation. After questioning, Wang Zongyi expressed his willingness to confess and provided a written confession (a copy of the confession and statement is attached). He described in detail his experience participating in Communist bandit activities and named Cui Weijie as one of the leading figures of the Communist Party in the school. Therefore, yesterday morning, the North Station Police Sub-bureau transferred Wang and Cui to the police headquarters for legal action.

The police department attaches great importance to this case. However, students who participate in Communist bandit activities are generally weak-willed and temporarily misled and go astray. It is hoped that they will awaken to the error of their ways and immediately surrender to the bureau. The authorities will be magnanimous, not hold them accountable for the past, and provide them with security guarantees. Furthermore, regarding rumors that students were beaten to death in the Jinan University student brawl, the police department officially declares that the rumors are absolutely false. The names of the Communist bandits confessed by Wang Zongyi have been communicated by the police department to the school authorities, students' parents, and guarantors, and personnel were dispatched to the school at 9:00 PM last night (the 10th) for questioning.

### Wang Zongyi's Confession: First, as a Probationary Party Member Under Observation; Small Group Meetings Held Weekly at Fudan University

The following is an excerpt from the confession and statement of Jinan University student Wang Zongyi: (1) Organizational Relationships: I was introduced to join the Communist Party by Ye Jinwen from Fudan University. Because my identity is that of an intellectual from a landlord family, according to Ye, "According to Party rules, intellectuals from landlord families can only be probationary party members first." At that time, I wrote an autobiography and an article on my views on the current situation, which were forwarded by Ye. Since then, I have had an organizational relationship with Ye. Because I am a probationary party member, I must wait for two and a half years of observation, so my organizational horizontal relationship must be under Ye's command. Except for the small group discussion meetings held weekly at Fudan University and the occurrence of horizontal relationships with ××× and others, no other horizontal relationships are allowed to occur. As for the direct command from the upper level, Ye is responsible. My lower-level task is to "unite" and "organize" students in the Chemistry Department of Jinan University. Because I am a probationary party member, I have no right to introduce party members, so no party organizational relationship has occurred at the lower level.

Daredevil Team; Responsible for Propaganda Work

(2) Work Plan: The work plan is divided into organizational work and regular work. Organizational work involves holding small group meetings every week to review the current situation and the progress and difficulties of regular work. The sole purpose of regular work is to recruit party members, and all launching of "student unrest" and striving for student unions are for this goal. Because I am a probationary party member, I am only responsible for propaganda work, that is, to be a daredevil for them. The work of contacting and exposing a wide range of students is done by probationary party members. Regarding propaganda methods, they are divided into oral and written. The type of book must be determined by the students' acceptance conditions, that is, using a method of seduction to gradually confuse the students. The oral propaganda method is to first explain the bitterness of the profession and the economic distress to the students. After the students feel sympathy, then conduct political propaganda. After one propaganda after another, the students will become confused.

Striving for Public Funding as the Goal; Full-Scale Launch in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou

The instructions on the development of the recent war situation are to complete the spring offensive before May, that is, to expand the occupation in North China and isolate Beijing and Tianjin. In northern Jiangsu, the base is sound and consolidated. In the northeast, after occupying Changchun, troops will enter the pass, so that the source of soldiers in North China can be used for crossing the river. After the spring offensive is completed, the large-scale crossing of the river will begin in May. During the crossing of the river, Communist party members in various schools will strive for public funding as the main goal and launch full-scale student unrest in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. After the student unrest is instigated, Communist party members in the labor sector will instigate labor unrest, creating a full-scale disruption. If the river crossing is successful, Communist party members from various schools will gradually induce students to enter the guerrilla areas south of the Yangtze River to participate in work, so that the foundation of the occupation can be "consolidated" quickly.

### Excerpts from Confession: Borrowing the Name of a Group to Tour Hangzhou; Secret Meetings Late at Night; Zhejiang University as the General Liaison Agency

The spring vacation is the best time for us to use, so we took the name of touring Hangzhou to discuss the steps for all activities and the means to be taken. Because Zhejiang University in Hangzhou is our general liaison and guidance agency for Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Anhui, and Jiangxi, it completely obeys the Hong Kong branch. ××× and others from Zhejiang University are directly in charge of this liaison and guidance agency. After arriving in Hangzhou, we settled some neutral students, and then we began to carry out our work. At about 2:00 AM on April 2nd, we gathered comrades from our school ××× and comrades from outside to discuss the work plan and how to carry out propaganda to win over neutral students. The discussion and resolution were: (1) Launch external organizations, such as the YMCA and the Women's Student Association, etc. (2) Form a Poor Student Mutual Aid Society to launch a full-scale public funding movement to create full-scale student unrest. (3) Launch the "One School, One Thing" movement to achieve the goal of the May riot. (4) Join forces with worker comrades and incite labor unrest, etc.

The travel expenses this time were subsidized by the top level with 20 million yuan. Several people from our school, including ×××, regularly attended joint meetings of various schools. At 8:00 AM on the 5th, a public memorial was held for Martyr Yu Zisan: Comrade ××× represented the Jinan University Student Union and gave a speech, the content of which was as follows: "Today, more than a thousand students from Shanghai and Hangzhou who are fighting for true democracy have gathered at the tomb of Martyr Yu to mourn. We feel very sad and very angry at the same time. Although the environment is harsh, we are still working very hard and struggling for democracy. We students from Shanghai will continue to expand the movement after we go back to give full play to greater strength. Now is the time, we should strengthen unity and use action to achieve the ideals of the true democratic movement."

### Arrests Continue Based on the List

[Report from our newspaper] There are two confessions from Wang Zongyi. The one published above is the handwritten confession at the Police Headquarters yesterday morning. In addition, there is another one that was left at the North Station Sub-bureau the day before yesterday. Director Yu personally inquired about it, and the confession was very detailed. It is said that Wang Zongyi finally burst into tears, saying that he had been deceived and expressed his repentance. The police authorities originally planned to launch a large-scale arrest yesterday in an attempt to catch all the Communist bandits in one fell swoop. Later, in order to take social stability into account, only the names on Wang's confession were arrested and questioned. Further steps will be taken depending on the development of the case.

[Another report] Lin Yuyin, a female student in the third grade of Jinan University, was arrested yesterday noon. Tension immediately appeared in the school. Some students stayed overnight outside the school last night.

All fishing boats that have suspended work will gradually go to sea today to resume fishing.

### Improving the Shengsi Fishing Port; Building a Breakwater in Shengshan

In order to protect China's East China Sea fishing industry, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry plans to allocate some relief materials to build a breakwater at Manzuitou in Shengshan to provide shelter for fishing boats and ensure the safety of fishermen's lives. The Marine Fisheries Supervision Office of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Region has been ordered to consult with the Shanghai Dredging Bureau to dispatch engineers to conduct surveys and measurements, and the Shanghai Fishing Market will first subsidize 20 million yuan for survey and measurement expenses for application.

### Stranded Xin'an Ship; Floated and Entered Port Yesterday

### All Convicts of Opium and Drug Cases in Prison Petition the Council, Appealing for Amnesty

The entire body of prisoners in the Shanghai Prison of this city, who were sentenced to imprisonment for opium and drug-related cases, yesterday petitioned the Council, stating in brief: "The convicts, blinded by ignorance, strayed onto the wrong path, unwisely seeking profit, violated the laws, and now bear the consequences, confined within these walls, the taste of iron bars is unbearably bitter. Every time we think about it, we cannot help but feel guilt and remorse, weeping until our clothes are soaked. Moreover, the convicts believe that they are neither great robbers nor incorrigibly wicked. At this juncture, when the nation is establishing a constitutional government, we should be given a path to self-renewal. If there is not a single person in the country who is sorrowful, then virtue should be encouraged, fathers and sons, brothers exhorting each other, and we would not dare to test the law again and suffer unexpected punishment. Now we hear that the National Assembly is in session and the President will also be elected. Once the new government is formed, the nation will surely issue a general amnesty to celebrate the grand event and show the people a fresh start. We have always looked up to your Council as the voice of the people and respectfully request that you suggest to the government that if a general amnesty is issued, the convicts should not be excluded, so that the fish in the dried-up ruts can find water in the rivers and streams and regain the path to self-renewal," and so on.

### Rice Distribution Malfeasance - Openly Offering Bribes - Ye Rentai Transferred to the District Procuratorate for Legal Action

The Shanghai Municipal Food Distribution Committee, during a spot check of rice shops on the 5th, discovered that the Ye Rentai rice shop in the Yimiao District had a discrepancy between the amount of rice in storage and the amount of payment submitted. Chen Zuoren, the commissioner stationed in the district by the Food Distribution Committee, and Guo Dahuan, the assistant, carefully examined the accounts and discovered that the payment for nine piculs and six pecks of distributed rice was short. Ye Guomin, the person in charge of the shop, under strict questioning, actually offered a bribe of 640,000 national currency to the investigators. Chen and Guo, believing that the shop not only failed to pay the grain dues but also attempted to commit fraud and dared to openly offer bribes, immediately asked Zhu Boya, the relevant field chief, to come to the shop. Ye Rentai of the shop issued a guarantee against bribery. The Food Distribution Committee has already sent the guarantee and the bribe money to the District Procuratorate yesterday for legal action.

Hoping Citizens Will Report Malfeasance

When the first group of rice shops in the Nanshi area of this city was delivering rice for the March ration distribution, one catty or half a catty of rice was deducted per picul to compensate for transportation losses. After receiving the report, the Food Distribution Committee stated that since rice shops are entrusted to pick up and transport, a 1.6% management fee (including packaging) has already been given, and they should not charge any fees from the rice shops. In addition to ordering the Shanghai Rice Market Management Committee to thoroughly investigate, refund the compensation, and strictly prohibit it, the Committee also hopes that citizens will report such malfeasance.

### Aircraft Smuggling of US Dollars - Two Foreign Employees Suspected - Laborers Tempted by Wealth - Theft Case Transferred for Investigation

[Report from this Newspaper] The Police Office of the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Communications yesterday transferred a case of theft and smuggling of US dollars, requesting the District Procuratorate to investigate. The defendants are Zhu Liukun, Han Hailin, Zhu Wenmei, Yu Chenglong, Cui Qianlin, Tan Shaoguang, and six others. The Police Office received a tip that on February 25th at 10:00 AM, a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) flight arrived in this city from San Francisco, USA, suspected of smuggling US dollars. The Police Office sent personnel to investigate and discovered that Zhu Liukun, a ground worker at the airport, had stolen US dollars and fled. Subsequently, it was discovered that Zhu had traveled extensively in the Suzhou and Hangzhou area, indulging in prostitution and extravagant spending, with an uncertain whereabouts. It was also discovered that Zhu had US dollars hidden at his sister Wenmei's place, and 200 US dollars and a broken watch were seized during a search. According to Wenmei's confession, her brother had deposited 600 US dollars with her and later took away 400 US dollars. It was further discovered that Zhu often frequented the singer Jinni (Yuying) in Suzhou, and 2.3 US dollars were found at Jin's place. On the 27th of last month, Zhu was arrested at the Da Sanyuan Restaurant. According to Zhu's confession, at 2:00 PM on February 25th, he and another ground worker, Yu Chenglong, were cleaning the plane. Yu discovered a yellow leather bag behind the radio operator's seat in the cockpit and immediately reported it to a foreign employee named Nash. Nash was panicked upon hearing this and told them not to make a sound before leaving in a hurry. Zhu and Yu opened the bag and saw more than 7,000 US dollars inside, realizing that they were smuggling US dollars. They then reported it to the foreman, Han Hailin. Han and others, after discussing it together, believed that since it was illegally smuggled US dollars, it would be okay to take the ill-gotten wealth. They then conceived the idea of theft, took out the US dollars, and divided them equally in the air-raid shelter. Han received 2,700 US dollars, Yu received 2,360 US dollars, and Zhu received 2,300 US dollars. Zhu fled immediately after stealing the money. CNAC foreign employee Kleven questioned Han Hailin and promised a bonus if the money was recovered. Han completely blamed Zhu. The Police Office successively arrested Zhu, Yu, Han, and suspects Cui Qianlin and Tan Shaowen and transferred them to the District Procuratorate for investigation. As for foreign employees Nash and Kleven, who are suspected of smuggling US dollars, although they vehemently denied it, the Civil Aviation Administration has restricted them from leaving CNAC before the investigation at the District Procuratorate is completed.

The countries with which we have begun direct exchange are the US Bureau of Narcotics and the United Nations Narcotics Board, and we plan to gradually extend this to other neighboring countries in the Far East and all contracting countries in the world. Japan was the main base for the war-time poisoning of China and international smuggling in the Far East, with traces all over the world. India, Vietnam, and the Dutch territories are historically opium-producing areas, and they implemented the opium monopoly system in the past and are adjacent to our country, so we should first and foremost pay attention to them, he said.

### Attempted Robbery Thwarted, Arrested - Opium Case Solved Incidentally

[Report from this Newspaper] The Zhabei Police Station received a tip at around 10:00 AM on the 2nd, stating that bandits were going to rob Heng Maoxing on South Sichuan Road. The station immediately sent officers to lie in ambush at the intersection of Min'guo Road and Xinqiao Street. Before long, the bandit Chen Asi arrived at the location and was immediately apprehended. A pistol, number 184190, a magazine, and five bullets were seized. After being interrogated at the station, he admitted that he had attempted to commit robbery. He confessed that he had come to Shanghai from Zhenjiang at the end of last winter and resided at the Sixin Hotel. In his spare time, he often chatted with his uncle at No. 52, Hengmao Lane, and learned that Li Yuxiang, a tenant in the same building's pavilion room, had considerable savings and was addicted to opium. Therefore, he conceived the idea of robbery. Based on this statement, the police officers rushed to Li's residence and found him with an opium-filled face. Opium smoking paraphernalia and two opium bubbles were seized in his room, so they were taken to the station together. After investigation and verification, Chen was charged with banditry and Li Yuxiang was charged with drug addiction and sent to the District Procuratorate for investigation and handling.

### The Mystery of the Madman Will Soon Be Revealed - District Court to Summon Yan Peixing Tomorrow - To Determine Whether He Has Mental Illness

[Report from this Newspaper] The District Court in the Yan Peixing case is scheduled to summon Yan Peixing tomorrow morning at 10:00 AM to determine whether he has mental illness. The summons has been served yesterday. Yan Peixing himself recently asked Han Fen, a Western-trained doctor and professor of neuropsychiatry at St. John's University and director of the neuropsychiatry department at Gongji Hospital, to examine him. The result of his examination report stated: "Mr. Yan has a sensitive, easily traumatized, and poorly controlled emotional personality. He lacks sufficient self-confidence in the face of life's difficulties, resulting in emotional reactions when facing the hostility of others and a sense of helplessness. In addition, he is actually a mentally sound person, with absolutely no signs of mental breakdown or mental exhaustion, not only possessing complete judgment and reasonable thinking ability, but also possessing special talent in dealing with affairs." At the same time, the police station has not found any signs of Yan's mental disorder in recent summonses. Therefore, the mystery of whether Yan Peixing has mental illness will not be difficult to solve. Although the case has been mediated by powerful figures, it is difficult to predict whether it can be "turned into nothing" because the case has caused a stir in society.

Shortage of Property in the Factory

Regarding the civil part, when Yan Peixing and his wife Yuan Baoying confronted each other at the police station a few days ago, Yuan expressed her willingness to return the property in the factory. At that time, after both parties went to inspect it together, they found dozens of boxes of steel heddles, with very high value, were missing, so the dispute has not been resolved. The police station is conducting a general investigation in the criminal part, and it was heard that Hou Jiyuan was summoned yesterday.

### Promoting Solidarity between the Motherland and Compatriots in Taiwan - Taiwan Provincial Inspection Group Arrives in Shanghai - Will Visit Various Places to See the Sights and Understand Politics, Economy, and Culture

Group Leader Huang Chunqing in Good Spirits, Composing a Quatrain in the Aircraft

[Report from this Newspaper] The domestic inspection group organized by the Taiwan Provincial Senators arrived in Shanghai yesterday, accompanied by Weng Qian, Deputy Director of Civil Affairs of the Taiwan Provincial Government. Mr. Weng, along with Huang Chunqing, the leader of the group, and group members Lu Yongkai, Liu Kuocai, Guo Guoji, Wu Ruitai, Ren Gongfan, Chen Wenshi, Huang Liandeng, Xie Hanru, Zhu Zaichang, Wang Yueqiao, and Chen Qingchi, thirteen people in total, took a CNAC flight and arrived at Longhua Airport at 1:30 PM. Representatives from the Municipal Government, the Municipal Council, and the Bank of Taiwan went to the airport to welcome them. After the inspection group disembarked from the plane, they drove to the Jinmen Hotel to rest. The reporter then visited them and, according to Deputy Director Weng, told reporters, "The senators of our province love the motherland and support the government, and are deeply familiar with the circumstances. In order to understand the situation in various parts of the country, the inspection group has been organized. The purpose of this trip is to gain a better understanding of the politics, economy, and culture of various parts of the motherland, so that we can provide reference for the construction of a new Taiwan on the day of our return."

Love for the Motherland Has Never Been Forgotten

Huang Chunqing, the leader of the group, who is known for not serving as a Japanese official, not speaking Japanese, and not changing his Japanese name during the Japanese occupation, is 74 years old. He is a well-known poet in Taiwan. He was in excellent spirits in the aircraft and showed the reporter a poem improvised in the aircraft, saying: "The sea and sky are like a painting through the crystal window, the warm spring breeze sends silver wings in pairs, the journey of ten thousand miles is full of roads, the passenger plane carries dreams to Shanghai." He also told reporters, "The purpose of this group is to promote the solidarity between the motherland and the compatriots in Taiwan. In the past 50 years of brutal Japanese rule, they did not want the compatriots in Taiwan to know about the revolutionary movement in China that overthrew the Manchu Qing autocratic regime, so the pictures and newspapers published in China were not allowed to enter Taiwan, nor were the compatriots allowed to have collections of the Three Principles of the People, and they were not allowed to return to their ancestral homes in the country to sweep the tombs and worship their ancestors. Chinese or European and American dignitaries were forbidden from approaching the compatriots. However, the spirit of the compatriots loving the motherland has never been forgotten for a day. Now that we are in the year of constitutional government, the time of the general election, and the day of the National Assembly, we have formed a group to come here, hoping to make a small contribution to promoting unity."

Separate Visits to Heads of Institutions

The group will attend a cherry blossom viewing party and visit Fuxing Park this morning, and visit Zhongshan Park this afternoon. Some members of the group have also decided to enjoy the Peking opera performances of Mei Lanfang and Ma Lianliang. Tomorrow, they will separately visit the municipal headquarters of the Kuomintang, the Municipal Council, the Garrison Command, and other institutions, and visit major newspapers and factories in the city. After visiting Mayor Wu at 10:00 AM on the 13th, they will focus on the economic aspects and make a general inspection. They are scheduled to go to Hangzhou for sightseeing on the 15th, return to Shanghai on the 20th, and fly to Beiping on the 21st to visit the ancient capital and culture. They plan to stay for a week and then return to Shanghai and go to Beijing to participate in the inauguration ceremony of the first president on May 5. If time permits, they plan to visit Wuhan and Guangzhou, the birthplace of the revolution, and take the opportunity to go to their ancestral graves in Fujian and Guangdong to worship their ancestors.

### Wang Zhixin Hosts the Press - Reports on the Handover of the Closing of the Exchange

Brokers' Transaction Account Balance Reached More Than 2 Trillion

[Report from this Newspaper] Mr. Wang Zhixin, general manager of the Shanghai Securities Exchange, hosted the press in this city at the exchange at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Mr. Wang gave a speech on the spot, describing in detail his feelings about the exchange complying with the order to suspend delivery. He said: "The delivery business of this exchange has recently been ordered to suspend delivery on time. As of April 3, the delivery account balance of this exchange was 105.5 billion yuan. The margin deposited by brokers was 52.3 billion yuan. According to regulations, 70% of the margin should be deposited with the National Bank, but this exchange deposited all of it. At that time, what was worried about was that the total transaction account balance of the brokers was estimated to be more than 2 trillion yuan. A slight mistake in the measures would inevitably lead to a financial crisis. Fortunately, the last issue was successfully delivered and concluded yesterday (9th)."

All measures taken by this exchange are handled in accordance with government laws and regulations. Delivery has been approved by the government from several trials to formal operation. This time, it was also urgently ordered to suspend it. Now I would like to briefly describe this exchange's feelings about the suspension of delivery:

(1) This government order to suspend delivery stated that after this exchange handled delivery, buyers and sellers of securities were often the same person, which could promote speculation. This statement is suspected of referring to arbitrage trading and is unfounded. Those who trust legal tender are willing to purchase spot goods and sell delivery in order to gain some slight interest. Only those who intend to invest for the long term are willing to sell spot goods and purchase delivery so that the securities will not be sold. Therefore, only those who require security and stability and those who are willing to invest funds in production are willing to buy and sell by means of arbitrage.

(2) Arbitrage has the effect of concentrating idle funds. Most of these idle funds come from scattered retail investors. If arbitrage is not done, they will compete to purchase daily necessities or make black market lending. Industry and commerce can use arbitrage to finance funds, but it is not believed that arbitrage funds are used for hoarding, nor is it believed that delivery leads to price increases.

(3) The level of interest rates depends entirely on the supply and demand of funds, and the same is true of arbitrage interest rates, and statistical arbitrage interest rates are often lower than the market's secret interest rates.

(4) The current phenomenon of speculation and hoarding is definitely not due to the existence of the securities market, let alone the opening of delivery. After the suspension of delivery, retail idle funds may be scattered into the path of speculation and hoarding. Because there is no adjustment of buying and selling within seven days, the responsiveness of securities prices may be even more acute.

### Sluggish Rice Market, Declining Flour Prices, Edible Oil Reaching New Heights

### Tung Oil Purchases Temporarily Suspended for Export

Reason: Continued Decline in Overseas Oil Prices

The China Trust Bureau's purchases of tung oil have been relatively quiet recently.

The same phenomenon is occurring in Wuzhou and Guangzhou. As of now, only 1,050 tons have been purchased. Furthermore, overseas markets have weakened, falling to around US$0.23 per pound.

According to a person in charge of the China Trust Bureau, the government has decided to temporarily suspend exports of purchased tung oil in order to stabilize domestic and international prices and prevent the international market from falling further. Exports will resume when there is demand in the international market and prices improve. Domestically, purchases will continue so that exporters can maintain their costs. The government's implementation of the purchase policy has already had a significant effect at this time.

### On Typewriters

— Zeshi

I once learned to type in Chinese. I learned it in three or four days, but I haven't used it in fifteen or sixteen years since I learned it. Firstly, I have no intention of being a typist, and secondly, I don't write a lot of letters or articles, so there's no need to buy a typewriter, and I can't afford it anyway.

But even if I could afford it, I would never buy one. To be honest, I'm against typing instead of writing. Yet there are people in the world who are so enthusiastic about typing that they think the current Chinese typewriters are not good enough and want to carefully study and improve them.

The purpose of changing writing to typing is often to be faster. As far as the currently popular Chinese typewriter is concerned, although some people have improved it, it is already many times faster than writing. If it is further improved, it will be even more "lightning fast." At that time, a large organization that originally needed dozens of copyists will probably only need one typist.

The purpose of inventing or improving tools and machines is to save manpower and time. This is a good thing. Taking the typewriter as an example, if I have to write 5,000 words a day at home, then even if I don't have to write in regular script, and I rack my brains, it will take at least five hours, and my hands will ache, my back will hurt, my appetite will be bad, and I will be constipated. If I use a typewriter, even an unimproved one, it will take at most three hours. Also, if I run a calligraphy shop or an organization whose main business is official documents and letters, before the typewriter was invented and improved, I would need ten employees. Now that I have a lightning-fast typewriter, I only need three at most. My salary expenses are greatly reduced and my income remains the same. Wouldn't that be great? So even if I have to send a respectful telegram to the person who invented or improved the typewriter, why wouldn't I want to?

However, if I make a living by copying official documents and letters for others, then I will not only hate the inventor or improver of the typewriter to the bone, but I will also not welcome it. Because even if I am not among those laid off, my work will definitely not decrease because of the typewriter, because the work that those who were laid off used to do will be done by me. If I am unlucky enough to be among those laid off, I will be in the pain of unemployment, and I would like to bite the inventor or improver of the typewriter three or five times.

Of course, since the invention of the typewriter, on the one hand, it has broken the rice bowls of many copyists. On the other hand, the manufacture and sale of typewriters requires people, which has opened a door to my profession. It is not necessarily a loss in the east and a gain in the west. But regardless of whether the loss and gain are equal, even if they are equal, I feel that there is no need to do this, adding a lot of trouble out of thin air.

Therefore, I think that invention is something that can be done and cannot be done. There are many things that are worth inventing. For example, I often suffer from the trouble of looking up dictionaries, and I sincerely hope that someone will invent an automatic dictionary. For example, if I want to look up a certain word, I don't have to flip through it. I just need to press it on the book, and the word will come out immediately. This invention can only increase the number of people employed and will not increase the number of unemployed people, because the person who looks up the dictionary will never need a full-time specialist.

On the contrary, for anything related to an established "industry," it is best not to invent labor-saving tools and machines for the time being. Those who talk about material civilization and promote science must think that the above is a fallacy, but looking across the nine continents, I am confident that my humble opinion has something to offer. My humble opinion is that scientific progress and the invention of machines to save manpower are good things, but they must be done in such a way that, for example, a copyist in a certain organization originally copied ten official documents a day, taking eight hours. Now, because of the invention and improvement of the typewriter, it only takes two hours to type ten official documents a day. The six hours saved can be used to read books, chat, play chess, sleep, and become fat and healthy. Otherwise, I would rather science regress and machines not be invented. Unfortunately, the current state of the world is in "otherwise," which is sad!

### A Futile Worry

— Tongtuo

The German astronomer Wolff of Heidelberg announced on September 11, 1909, that he had discovered a comet that, according to predicted timing, would sweep across the sky on May 18, 1910. This news did not cause surprise because, according to two thousand years of historical records, this special Halley's Comet (Holley's Comet) sweeps across the earth once every seventy-six years.

As early as the eighteenth century, astronomers had calculated that the comet would appear in the sky above the earth in 1910. Therefore, there was no surprise or reaction to Wolff's statement. However, some self-proclaimed clever scientists did talk about various old superstitions about comets. For example, when the comet swept across the earth in 1066, it was the time when the Normans invaded Britain. There were also several other times when Halley's Comet appeared, floods occurred, wars broke out, epidemics raged, and famines spread... Some unfortunate things always happened.

After Wolff discovered the comet's position, other astronomers also unanimously believed that on May 18, 1910, the comet would pass very close to the earth and would be swept by its tail. And it is said that the comet's tail contains a flammable toxic gas called cyanogen, which will harm living things on earth. So everyone felt scared. Astronomers everywhere predicted that the comet's descent would cause great disaster. To put it seriously, it could cause the end of the world.

As early as early April 1910, people could see the comet with the naked eye. The public felt extremely frightened. When the comet swept towards northwestern China, such as Hankou and Beiping, the peasants believed that it was a symbol of resistance to the royal family (referring to the Xinhai Revolution—translator). Bloody tragedies occurred on the streets of the city.

At the same time, the appearance of the comet reflected the abnormality of personal psychology. A passenger on a ship bound for Jamaica saw the comet speeding from Cuba and fell into the sea. A wealthy Hungarian landlord committed suicide because of the appearance of the comet, leaving a suicide note saying that he was afraid that the comet would cause him to die, so it would be better to commit suicide. A farmer in Alabama committed suicide by poisoning himself to avoid the comet's fierce flames.

Corey, chairman of the US Steel Corporation, advised friends to quickly recover their "headway" because the appearance of the comet would cause an economic collapse. On May 18, the situation became even more serious, and everyone asked the observatory how to resist the toxic flames of cyanogen. In Chicago and Berlin, women in the home used rags to block the gaps in doors and windows; a manufacturer in Manhattan built an armored small room with a hundred barrels of oxygen inside to supply the lack of air. Some people went to religion. Mexican aborigines built crosses on the tops of mountains and prayed day and night. The Soviet Union had all-night church services. Aborigines in Potorico lit candles and marched, leading to the desolation of the morning forest. Many people in the United States also wasted time and lost their jobs, sitting and waiting for chaos. Miners in the Colorado silver mine hid at the bottom of the mine and waited for the comet to pass. Work in the cotton and tobacco fields in the south was suspended because blacks had to pray for God's salvation.

Then, the great May 18, 1910, came. There was no movement during the day. It is said that the most terrifying thing was at night. Some people wanted to celebrate their last night on earth, so they held a "Comet Cocktail Party." Some held "Comet Dance Parties" in rooftop gardens or parks, but the night passed and there were no anomalies. Only a French observatory saw a little phosphorescence in the sky, and the compass on the route was slightly affected by radio waves. That's all. No toxic gas, no chaos, and no end of the world.

### Also Talk About Names

— Jin Yuan

Chen Zuogao's article "Idle Talk About Names" in this column on March 25 traces the source and explores the distance, and the content is described in great detail; however, the citations of ancient people's names seem to be still less searched and recorded, so I will not hesitate to use words and restate what I know.

In the past, there were many people with the same name and style name (字), which is often seen in historical records, especially in the Tang Dynasty; for example, Guo Ziyi and his sons all had the same name and style name. The recently unearthed Wang Zhongkan base record (stone is now in Chongxiao Temple, Beiping) also has the sentence "Your name is Zhongkan, style name is Zhongkan." There are also those who use three characters as the style name, such as Zhang Tianxi of the former Liang Dynasty, whose style name was Gong Chungha. Qu Tu Wuwei, a Taoist in the Sui Dynasty, whose style name was Wu Buwei. Chao Yidao of the Song Dynasty, whose style name was Shuo Zhi, and his other style name was Boyifu. And Ouyang Wenzhong Gong's epitaph of Liu Yuanfu's tomb records the Liu brothers saying: "Chang's style name is Bo Gongfu, Ban's style name is Zhong Yuanfu." Until the end of the Ming Dynasty, the remnant old Chuan Shan, whose style name was Qingzhu, and another style name was Gong Zhituo. Wen Ruizuan, whose style name was Tian Nai Xue. Tao Yi, whose style name was Zhao Wanyou. Liang Liu, whose style name was Yuan Zhi Shen. Zhang Geng, who wrote the Painting and Calligraphy Records, whose style name was Gong Zhi Yu. And in the Tang Dynasty, women mostly used three characters as the style name. Yang Jun's wife, Wei's inscription: "The wife's name is Tan Te, style name is Kun Ye Li." Cui's tomb record of Mrs. Lu Gong: "The wife's name is Ji, title is Zun Dexing." The epitaph of the Upasaka Wei Zengyou: "The Upasaka's name is Wei Zengyou." The tomb record of the Bhikkhuni Fayan: "Fayan's style name is Wu Suode." The tomb record of Mrs. Fan: "Surname Fan, name is Ru Lianhua." There are many others, and I cannot record them all, but they are not commonly seen after the Tang Dynasty.

It is quite rare for the surname and name to be the same. Xin Jiaxuan had two concubines, one named Tiantian and the other named Qianqian. In the Ming Dynasty, there was Shen Shen who wrote four volumes of Wine History. In Qing Shanyin, there was a staff member named Sun Sun. In modern times, there is Ye Ye (namely Mr. Ye Chucang), an important person in the Party and State. And it is said that in Hunan during the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty, there was a scholar named Le Le Le, which takes the meaning of the benevolent love the mountains and the wise love the waters. The three characters are read three times, like Yue Xiao Luo in the past, which is incredible and can also be regarded as a new and strange facet in the history of names.

Moreover, the combination of surnames and names is also widely heard, such as the ancient people Tian Yannian, Qian Yannian, Wang Xiangniang, Zhang Wanggang, Chen Xunren, and Tian Juanjuan, Lu Fufu, whose surnames and names are in the same rhyme. Such as Luo Yi Qing, Miao Boran, Li Wuyan, Qian Wanxuan, Ming Jiu Han, Wang Zuo Cai, Wanxiang Chun, Shi Yu Hua, Cheng Jiuwan, Fu Hao Li, Mi Wanzhong, whose surnames and names are connected with meaning. Those who use numbers have sixty-seven, seventy-one, seventy-five, eighty-six, and ninety. Those who use stems and branches have Shen Hai, Ding Bing, Yin Wu Chen, and Ding Shen. Those who resemble women include Feng Fu, Cui Yuanyang, Xu Furen, and Ding Furen. Those with the same rhyme category include Song Youyuan, Ruan Xian, Tan Yuanxian, Qi Tai, Ruan Yuan, Ma Xitai, and Xiao Jing. And Wu Dayou, whose style name is Youda, Mao Qizong, whose style name is Zongqi, whose reversed name is the style name, is even more interesting. As for the Qing Gong Gongxiang (Xiaoqi), he said Taixi, Wu Wu, Cheng, Xiaoding, Jiang Shangyiye, Shua Ci, Changpao, Yin Jiu Shi Rou Mian Hua Seng... and so on, reaching several dozen, which is really not as good as Shitao monk who has specialized in it before. (Editor's note: When I was studying in middle school, I met a classmate whose surname was "Liu." According to him, his surname must be written in lowercase "Da," not in uppercase "Lu.")

### American Recruitment Advertisements

— Bentian

Recently, Shanghai has been conscripting young men, and the selection has been completed. Huangpu District has announced the list of those selected. Military service is an obligation that citizens should fulfill. However, life in the Chinese army is really too poor. Looking at the recruitment situation in the United States, you can understand the difference between the two sides. Below are recruitment advertisements in American newspapers.

(1) Young people aged seventeen to twenty-nine, do you want to travel? The US Navy, in addition to giving you the best remuneration and expert training, can also provide you with a strange experience, interesting activities, comfortable life, and exquisite food. Young people, this opportunity must not be missed. For details, please visit the nearest Navy Recruitment Station for inquiries.

(2) Don't wait any longer, delay will make you lose your opportunity. The "Soldiers' Rights Act" has not expired, and it is effective for people who join the US Marine Corps. Those who want to join, please contact the Marine Corps Recruitment Station as soon as possible.

### Cosmetics

— Nianhong

It is said that true beauty is natural and does not require decoration. However, in fact, there are still many people, things, and objects that are decorated, precisely because these people, things, and objects were not very beautiful in the first place, so they had to borrow artificial means.

In fact, there is nothing wrong with a neat appearance and polite attitude, but it should not be too contrived. It is even more unacceptable to forget to improve the internal goods while only focusing on decorating the facade. It is necessary to talk about efficiency in doing things, but it is not possible to only engage in superficial and impractical work in order to strengthen efficiency, because being strong on the outside but weak on the inside cannot help the facts. On the contrary, it will only become an obstacle to improving efficiency.

Take the postal service, which is praised as the most successful of the various state-owned enterprises, for example. Recently, there seem to be many new achievements and improvements, such as rush-hour mailboxes, mobile post offices, post kiosks, and district delivery. Among them, some can indeed benefit the public, but some do not have much use, such as mobile post offices. In fact, very few people who actually mail letters accurately calculate the time to wait for the bus; the same is true for post kiosks. Every time I walk past the post kiosk on Baxian Bridge, I think of Jinling Middle Road. It seems superfluous to build another post kiosk here. Recently, I heard that there are also glass mailboxes appearing, and I don't think it makes much sense. It would be better to save this money to increase the salaries of hardworking postal workers, or to set up more village agencies to be more practical and beneficial.

The reason why the post office is used as an example here is because the current post office is better than most institutions in adopting public opinion, but in essence, there are still many places that need to be improved in the post office. Recently, postal rates have increased. The increase can be forgiven, but if the increased money is spent on decorating the surface work, I say it cannot be forgiven.

However, the example of the post office is a small one. In the entire China, whether it is a government agency, a private company, or all administration, it only focuses on the surface. What the authorities require of administrative personnel is only a clean and efficient surface. I remember a foreign reporter said that Chinese politicians are mostly plasterers by origin, because what they do is just layer after layer of brushing white powder on the wall, as long as it looks snowy white and shiny, as for the foundation of the wall, they usually don't ask questions. Although this is close to joking, it is a fact. Do we want to remain silent and ashamed?

### Little Raindrops

— Shiji Mei

Plants are green once a year, animals are green once in a lifetime, especially

When children write essays, the opening is either "Time is like water" or "Life in the world"—"Time is like water" is "worldliness," "life in the world" is "human nature";—children are small but not small-minded, and villains also like to talk big.

One move in chess can determine the whole game.

One thought can determine a person's life.

Immortals in paradise want to think about the mortal world, and demons in hell want to be reborn. It's not just people who are dissatisfied with reality.

Birth, old age, sickness, death, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness are two equations—a system of life equations

Such fragrant and rich wine will also go bad; how many days can people's happy times last?

### Ants Build Bridges

— Dansun

A naturalist wanted to study the question of "Are ants really talented?" so he paid attention to the ants' actions. One day, on a power line between a stone wall and an apple tree, there were four or five ants running back and forth on the line. So the scholar wrapped adhesive paper around a section of the power line near the wall, so that the ants could not pass freely. Two days later, when the scholar observed again, in addition to one ant being stuck on the paper because it was careless, he also saw that many tender leaves of the apple tree had already been laid on the adhesive paper, and many ants were walking safely across the bridge made of leaves.

### Lazy Woman Fish

— Liuyun

According to legend, in the Huainan area, there is a kind of fish called "Lazy Woman Fish," which is said to be the daughter-in-law of the Yang family, who was not diligent in her duties and was drowned by her mother-in-law and turned into fish. The fish's fat can be used for lighting candles, but when used to illuminate the qin and play chess, it shines brightly, and when used to illuminate spinning, it is no longer bright. It can be said that it does not understand its degree until death, and it is really too lazy to thoroughly understand it.

### Cherry Blossoms

### A Spontaneous Verse on Appreciating Cherry Blossoms

— Zhang Yiqu

Yesterday, I was invited by Mayor Wu Guozhen, Director Zhao Zukang, etc., and hurried to the old Mitsui Garden to appreciate cherry blossoms. I spontaneously composed three quatrains as follows:

(1)

The spring breeze and fragrant trees sing new orioles, the flowers bloom in the second month of Jiangnan, thousands of purples and reds, the chickens are provincial knowledge, the clear scarlet is only limited to brightness.

(2)

The lush cherry blossoms are free from the dust of weaving, the pavilions and buildings are embellished with newness everywhere, it is like living in Xinghua Village, the warm fragrance and sunny flowers can't win the spring.

(3)

The best products from Japan are piled up like brocade, the broken rivers and mountains return to spring again, after listening to a song across the river, Chongqing's business has more sorrow on this day.

### The Forgetful Edison

— Leng Leng

The scientist with the worst memory is the inventor of the light bulb, Edison. Especially in this great man's childhood, he was famous for being forgetful: in school, he would completely forget what he had learned. His grades were the worst in the whole grade, and even the teachers could only sigh helplessly—no one complained that he was stupid and clumsy. Some doctors, after examining his brain and finding it had a special abnormality, dared to predict dogmatically that he would definitely die of brain disease.

What was the extent of Edison's forgetfulness? A very small fact can explain it: it is said that once when he was using all his brainpower to think about a major scientific problem, his feet walked to the tax office. There were many taxpayers, arranged like a long snake, paying in turn to the authorities. When it was Edison's turn, he couldn't say his name for a while. Although he tried hard to think about it for a while, he had forgotten it completely; as a result, his neighbor told him that he knew his name was Thomas Edison. This joke was immediately spread out, and it has not been forgotten until now.

Edison's spirit of hard work is amazing enough. He often buries himself in the laboratory all day and all night to do research. One morning, when the servant brought breakfast, he was dozing off, and the servant did not dare to disturb him. But at this time, his assistants had already finished breakfast, taking advantage of the moment of leisure, and intended to tease him once—a full plate of eggs and ham and a full cup of coffee had been replaced with empty plates and empty cups in front of Edison. When he woke up, saw these empty plates, drank the cup of coffee, and the bread crumbs all over the table, he suspiciously rubbed his eyes, thought about it, and thought he had indeed had breakfast. So, as usual, he started working after smoking a cigarette. It was not until his assistants laughed beside him that he knew he had been tricked.

### Leisurely Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 14: Leisurely at Sea (123)

Reaching the doorway, a thought suddenly struck his heart: What would he say to his father upon this sudden return? To reveal his distress, the old man might not understand. Yet, to remain silent would feel like a suppression of pent-up sorrow, a need for catharsis. For an individual, poverty often leads to thoughts of returning home. Today, Zhuzhai found himself in such a state. His heart ached, compelling him to return and confide in his parents. Thus, he had summoned a carriage, only to feel a sense of shame upon arriving at his doorstep, hesitant to proceed. Eventually, he resolved that regardless of his father's scolding or resentment, he must see him and pour out his heart, seeking solace. Pushing open the front door, he proceeded straight to the inner courtyard. Lifting the door curtain, he saw his father, Yuru, and his mother conversing inside. Seeing Zhuzhai enter, Yuru inquired, "Do you have time to return today?" Zhuzhai felt a pang of sorrow at his father's question. His mother added, "Zhuzhai, you look unwell. What troubles you?" This further deepened Zhuzhai's distress, rendering him speechless. He sat on a chair, tears streaming down his face. His mother exclaimed in alarm, "Zhuzhai, what's the matter?" Unable to articulate his feelings, Zhuzhai merely dabbed at his tears with a handkerchief. A period of silence ensued, broken by Yuru's sigh. "No need to explain your affairs. I am more or less aware of everything. I know all about your escapades. Regarding your situation, I visited Qihuan's home. Qihuan is intelligent and understanding of my intentions. To preserve our family's reputation and safeguard your honor, she is willing to sacrifice her own views, endure hardship, and bear the brunt of criticism, all to give you a jolt and sever your infatuation. I admire this girl greatly. Perhaps now, you harbor resentment towards her seeming heartlessness. However, all her actions were to fulfill her promise. She deliberately engaged in behaviors she disliked, creating a negative impression to dissuade you from longing for her. Only I am aware of her efforts. Yesterday, I heard from Uncle Xiao Bai that she has returned to the stage in Shanghai and has a promising future. You need not worry about her any longer. From now on, you must tread the righteous path and strive for success." Hearing Yuru's words, Zhuzhai felt as if the old man had spoken everything he wanted to say. He replied, "I understand Qihuan's sacrifices and feel sorry for her. I know my past actions were wrong. I wish to return home, but my daughter-in-law is very displeased with me and will not allow my return, which makes me very distressed."
