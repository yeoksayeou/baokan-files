Regarding the issue of the organization for using US aid, the United States hopes that we can set up a special agency to handle it. The Executive Yuan previously intended not to set up a separate agency, so it is still under consideration. Even if a new agency is established, it may have to wait until the new Executive Yuan is formed.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Bei Zuyi and Zhang Jia'ao jointly paid respects to Chairman Chiang and President Zhang, Minister Yu Hongjun, and others. They also had detailed discussions and research on how to use US aid to stabilize prices and promote the economy in our country, and a decision was made.

### Communist Bandits Clamor for a "May Crossing of the Yangtze," Sun Lianzhong Says it's Impossible, Calls for Guiding the Mental Distress of Young Students

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Sun Lianzhong, Commander of the Capital Garrison, called on the press to help guide the mental distress and gloom of the general youth and students at his press conference at 9:00 AM on the 2nd, and then answered questions from reporters as follows:

Question: The communist bandits have declared a "May Crossing of the Yangtze," what defense plans does your department have?

Answer: The "May Crossing of the Yangtze" declared by the communist bandits is nothing more than a wild clamor, and is absolutely impossible, for the following reasons: (1) The main force of the bandits disturbing the Dabie Mountains has been defeated by us. (2) The bandit nests entrenched in Shandong have long been destroyed by us. (3) Scattered bandits in Jiangnan and Jiangbei have been suppressed repeatedly, and there is no possibility of establishing a base. Based on the above reasons, the communist bandits' claim to cross the Yangtze is absolutely impossible to succeed. Even if there are sporadic bandit groups who sneak across, our military has made strict deployments and can eliminate them at any time.

Question: It is heard that the communist bandits are plotting to create riots in the cities in May, is it possible? Answer: The communist bandits are inciting student movements and labor unrest in the cities, attempting to open a second battlefield to coordinate with military rebellion. This is their consistent conspiracy and trick. This headquarters is responsible for guarding the capital area and ensuring the safety of the people within its jurisdiction. If the above occurs, we will strictly punish them in accordance with the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the State During the Suppression of Rebellion Period.

Question: Are student movements in Nanjing actually manipulated and directed by communist bandits behind the scenes?

Answer: The student movements in various cities today are part of the communist bandits' implementation of the so-called "International Red Group Movement Policy." Recently, the pseudo "All-China Student Federation" has incited various deceptive slogans such as "anti-hunger," "anti-persecution," "striving for public funding," and "striving for autonomy," hoping to create a nationwide student movement. In Nanjing, it is also being brewed. Handouts from the "Communist Bandit War Criminal Investigation Department" and reactionary propaganda slogans and cartoons that speak up for the communist bandits have now been discovered in various schools. Question: If the student movement continues to expand, what attitude will your department take?

Answer: I am determined to follow the Leader's utmost care for youth, and will guide the students in advance, hoping that the young students will love the country, protect their studies, love themselves, abide by the law, and not be deceived by communist propaganda. If there are those who are obsessed and willing to work for the communist bandits, this department will enforce the law.

Question: Is it true that student movements and labor unrest echo each other?

Answer: The communist bandits hope that labor unrest and student movements will cooperate to achieve their attempt at civil unrest, but there are many factories in the garrison area, and the workers' political awareness is particularly high. They can all coordinate labor and management to jointly promote increased production and achieve the goal of suppressing the rebellion and building the country. Therefore, although the communist bandits have exhausted their efforts to coordinate labor unrest with student movements, they have been unable to succeed. Occasional labor-management or labor disputes are nothing more than disputes over each other's rights and interests, and they are settled once they are guided.

[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 2nd] After being severely attacked by the National Army, the bandits who infiltrated the empty city of Runan are now in a static state. It is judged that the bandit invasion of Runan is obviously to contain the National Army from reinforcing the west.

### Military Progress in Southern Guangdong, Defections of Newly Recruited Traitor Bandits Increase Daily

### Bandit Strongholds Along the Jianhe River in Southern Tianjin are Still Being Attacked

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 2nd] On the evening of the 1st, over 2,000 bandits from the 20th and 21st Regiments of the Bohai Military Region attacked various strongholds along the southern bank of the Jianhe River in southern Tianjin. They were gradually repelled by the National Army at dawn on the 2nd.

### Unable to Endure High-handed Rule by Chinese Communists, Mongolians Take Up Arms to Defend Themselves

[United Press, Beiping, 2nd] A foreign observer who has lived in Inner Mongolia for a long time said on the 2nd that the Chinese Communist Party has failed to win the hearts and minds of the people of Inner Mongolia, and that the support of the people in the three provinces of Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan is enough to sway the military balance of power between the two sides in Inner Mongolia. Mongolians "now regard the Chinese Communist Party as an irreconcilable enemy." The communist bandits' bestial atrocities and excessive measures have alienated all the people of Inner Mongolia. After conquering the Northeast, the Japanese invaders implemented a cunning "Inner Mongolia Policy." Japanese political workers took advantage of the Mongolians' inability to resolve the issues of land, economy, and autonomy with the Chinese government and gained great benefits. At that time, the Mongolians quite resented the government's forceful "Sinicization" policy. After the Japanese surrender, the Chinese Communist Party launched a plan to win over the Mongolians' loyalty, allowing the Mongolians local autonomy, improving the economy, and important minority rights, and established the "Inner Mongolia Autonomous United Movement Committee," later renamed the "Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government," with its headquarters in Wangyemiao, Liaobei. Later, the Chinese Communist Party broke its promises, its words and deeds were completely different, and it despised the Mongolians' customs and religions. It also carried out large-scale collective massacres of Mongolians. Whenever the Chinese Communist Party arrived in a place, the residents had already fled in advance. Although the Mongolians had no government encouragement or assistance, they still automatically took up arms to resist the communist army, and repeatedly attacked and inflicted heavy casualties on the communist army. The Mongolians have all abandoned the "Red Regime" of Wangyemiao. If the government expresses sincerity in resolving the Mongolian issue, they will return tomorrow with weapons in hand. If the government can help them with weapons, the Mongolians can drive the Chinese Communist Party out of Inner Mongolia within a day.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Renamed Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Functions Still Under Study

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] According to the Executive Yuan Organization Law promulgated in accordance with the Constitution, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has been renamed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. It is learned that because the Ministry of Economic Affairs is at the beginning of constitutional governance and will change its name, it has drafted an Organization Law of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and sent it to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the National Government and submission to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. However, the content of the organization law has not been changed. In the entire draft, only the words "economic affairs" have been changed to "industry and commerce." The ministry still has seven departments, including control and industry. However, it remains to be studied whether the functions of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce stipulated in the Executive Yuan Organization Law in the Constitution are the same as the current functions of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

### People of the Capital Line Up to Visit the National Assembly Hall

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The National Assembly Hall was opened on the 2nd, from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM, for citizens to visit freely. The citizens of the capital who went to visit were unusually enthusiastic. By the time it stopped opening, there were no less than tens of thousands of people. The visitors lined up automatically. The afternoon visitors were the most numerous. The line stretched from the entrance of the Assembly Hall through the Executive Yuan and all the way to the middle section of Bieting Lane, several thousand meters long, and entered in an orderly manner.

### Hong Lanyou Expresses His Feelings, Praises the Achievements of the National Assembly, and Especially Admits the Democratic Spirit of the Representatives

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly, recently published his views on the National Assembly as follows: "The conference lasted for one month and four days from the opening on February 29 to the closing. With the successful completion of the mission of this conference, it can be foreseen that China's democratic government will enter a broad road and become a bright future with unlimited prospects. There are roughly the following points: First, the conference deeply recognized the current domestic situation. In order to adapt to the emergency situation caused by the communist bandits' rebellion, the President was authorized to make emergency and effective arrangements in order to quickly eliminate the bandit disaster and remove obstacles to constitutional governance. According to the procedures of Article 174 of the Constitution, temporary provisions were formulated during the period of mobilization and war, and it was specified that these provisions would be decided by the National Assembly at a temporary meeting convened before December 25, 1950, for further extension or abolition. Before the completion of the suppression of the rebellion before the temporary meeting of the National Assembly, the Legislative Yuan may also resolve to request the President to declare the temporary provisions invalid. The temporary limit has no impact on the essence of the Constitution, but it also meets the expectations of the people across the country, so this decision is the resolute decision of the Assembly in response to the needs of the times. Another is that the election of the President and Vice President was voted successively for a total of five times. The order was orderly, and the choices made by each representative based on free will fully demonstrated the democratic spirit and established a good model for constitutional governance. In addition, the Assembly passed more than 800 proposals to the government, the content of which is aimed at reality, and all have contributions that meet the needs of the times in terms of national defense, suppression of rebellion, politics, diplomacy, economy, education, youth, and society. It also fully expresses the people's expectations. In the future, the government will adopt them separately, and they will definitely achieve results and benefit constitutional governance. As for the discussions of representatives on the proposals during each meeting, they are extremely serious. Whenever opinions differ and debates are heated in the meeting, the chairman proposes that the provisions of a certain article of the rules of procedure should be followed, that is, there is no objection and the proposals can be handled in an orderly manner. It can be seen that the spirit of democracy and law-abiding in the meeting. In short, this conference had more than 2,800 representatives attending, which was an unprecedented grand meeting. With such a large number of people meeting at a time of carrying on the past and opening up the future, the historical mission it bears is extremely important, but the meeting proceeded in an orderly manner and the mission of the Assembly was successfully completed, especially making me deeply admired in addition to serving the affairs. During the conference, the gentlemen reporters of the press worked tirelessly day and night, spreading accurate and rapid reports at home and abroad, establishing public opinion, and providing a lot of assistance to the conference. As for the colleagues of the Secretariat of the Assembly, they worked diligently and tried their best, but because the response and coordination were still unable to fully comply with scientific regulations, omissions and defects were still unavoidable. I have been frequently comforted by the Presidium of the Assembly and the representatives, and there is a resolution of praise and gratitude to the colleagues of the Secretariat in the Presidium meeting. I am very grateful."

### Mo Dehui Expresses His Feelings About Attending the National Assembly

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Mo Dehui, a representative of the National Assembly, recently published his feelings about attending the Assembly, saying: The mission of the National Assembly has been successfully completed, the head of state has been obtained, national affairs have been entrusted, and the foundation for constitutional governance has been laid, which is very gratifying. Personally, I have made few contributions to the Assembly, and I have tried my best to fulfill my national duty. There are about three points that I can tell the people of the country: (1) Participating in the election of the Vice President is purely based on expressing the spirit of the whole people supporting constitutional governance, and announcing the facts at home and abroad that our entire country is moving towards democracy. (2) The temporary provisions I proposed are based on the basic spirit of my years of efforts in national affairs, and I have always advocated promoting the cooperation of all parties. The emergence of these temporary provisions is actually due to the consultation of the three major parties of the Kuomintang, the Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party. I also participated in it, so I have only made my original intention to come forward to ask the Assembly to discuss it, and it was approved by the representatives with warm support and unanimous passage. This case is almost a major manifestation of the harmony and cooperation of the three parties in this Assembly. (3) As the convener of the Foreign Affairs Review Group, I submitted to the Assembly for approval, based on the decision of the majority, a proposal urging the Soviet Union to fulfill the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. Its impact has been deeply valued by all parties. The purpose of this case is to urge the Soviet Union to earnestly fulfill its treaty, in order to ensure the Northeast and stabilize the country. It not only benefits the improvement of Sino-Soviet friendly relations, but also greatly contributes to world peace.

### Shenyang Authorities Evacuate Refugees

Unmarried Men Made to Join the Army

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 2nd] The total number of refugees concentrated in Shenyang has reached 300,000, and public security and food are a major burden on the municipality. The authorities will evacuate them, and unmarried men will be made to join the army or participate in garrison troops and engage in the Hun River water conservancy project.

### National Representatives Leave One After Another, More Than 300 People Leaving Nanjing in Recent Days, Chairman Summons Representatives to Inquire About the People's Situation in Northern Jiangsu

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] After the closing of the National Assembly, the representatives were eager to return home. On April 30th, 46 representatives left Nanjing, on May 1st, 95 representatives left Nanjing, and on the 2nd, more than 200 representatives left Nanjing. The transportation group of the Assembly has been handling transportation tools on their behalf. The travel section of the group is currently concentrating all its efforts to handle this matter. In terms of air transportation, air tickets can be purchased within the section. In terms of water and rail transportation, tickets can be purchased preferentially from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company or the Railway Administration based on the registration form of the transportation group.

[Another Dispatch] Chairman Chiang summoned Jiangsu representatives Jiang Jianbai, Wu Peijun, Bao Mingshu, Liu Zhixun, Liu Jihong and other five people at his official residence on Huangpu Road at 4:30 PM on the 2nd, and inquired in detail about the people's situation in northern Jiangsu.

Editorial

### Addressing the Relief Problem of Refugees

The severity of the refugee problem is increasing day by day, because the number of people is too large, and the provision of food, clothing, and shelter has become a problem. Today, it is no longer just a matter of urban appearance, but has entered the realm of public security. Looking at the Yongxitang illegal occupation incident that occurred a few days ago, and the early occupation incidents of the Chaohuai Mountain Villa, etc., all of which have involved social order; and with the spread of the flames of war, the number of those arriving later is in the thousands, still endless. It can be seen that if this problem is dealt with piecemeal, without unified planning, and a proper solution is determined as soon as possible, I am afraid that a single spark can ignite a more serious consequence.

After the dissolution of the Shanghai Multiple Relief Association, the Relief Committee was immediately established to continue handling this matter with the concerted efforts of everyone, which shows that the authorities attach great importance to this. We naturally hope that it can actively proceed and quickly determine a thorough solution. Shanghai has relatively abundant financial resources and has always been most enthusiastic in handling various disaster relief and charitable undertakings. Regardless of the official or private sector, for the most urgent matters, it is expected that they will not be slightly negligent, so that the signs of various deteriorations will become increasingly profound.

However, the current refugees, except for a very small number who are original paupers, are mostly those who have fled from various war zones. Among them, those from northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and Shandong account for the majority, and there are also many who have been sent back from overseas and have landed in this port one after another. Although it is said that disaster relief and aiding neighbors does not distinguish between regions, it is true that there is a regret of insufficient strength to supply these refugees from all directions, who are arriving in a continuous stream, in terms of housing, facilities, and supplies. Since the problem is national, not just a local matter, we believe that in addition to the best efforts of various places to provide relief and shelter, the responsibility for this overall planning must be shouldered by the central government.

Not long ago, refugees returned from Sakhalin were sent by this city to Taiwan, but the Taiwan authorities refused to take them in and sent them back on the original ship. Recently, it has been reported that refugees in this city will be sent to Sanmen Bay to engage in reclamation, which is of great significance in theory. However, Sanmen Bay is under the jurisdiction of Zhejiang, and whether the local government welcomes it and whether the implementation can be mutually coordinated remain to be proven by facts. We believe that if these kinds of things are planned and managed by the central government, it will be much more convenient in fact.

It is common knowledge that the central government is currently experiencing financial difficulties, and in the aspect of funding, or due to reality, it is impossible not to take it into consideration. However, in addition to including relief funds in the national budget, the materials for Sino-American relief are more than a single amount, and the numbers are not small. For example, the American rice currently allocated to the five major cities, the cash obtained from its sale, was originally stipulated to be used exclusively for relief, and the surplus funds and materials left over after the end of the Executive Yuan, if transferred for refugee relief, it is expected that the Allied countries will not object. In addition, the relief special donation item is also designated to be used exclusively for relief and is not allowed to be transferred for other purposes. Although this donation is still in the initial stage of mobilization and may not have been received yet, the plan has been determined and is bound to be implemented, and it is expected that the future receipts will be considerable. Therefore, the funding item for relief work does not seem to be too difficult. At the very least, it is much less difficult than each place trying to raise funds on its own, collecting them piecemeal.

We also know that the central government is not completely ignoring this matter. It has issued orders to various places to provide shelter separately, and it has also allocated funds to provide subsidies separately. It has repeatedly ordered the border counties to find ways to block them, not allowing them to leave the country arbitrarily; unfortunately, those who are forbidden are forbidden, and those who come continue to come. The number is too large, and it is not something that each city and county can cope with by finding ways locally.

The central government has its central responsibility, and of course, the local government also has its local responsibility. It has been said since ancient times that disaster relief is like fighting a fire. When the fire burns to your eyebrows, shirking responsibility is not the way, and embellishment is not thorough; especially for actions that hinder order and are close to causing trouble, the responsible authorities must earnestly prevent and maintain them to protect the public's peace. It has been heard that the content of refugees in various places is also quite complex. There are local ruffians who use refugees to seek profit, and there are also those who intercept relief items, exploit refugees, and fill their own pockets. If these bad habits are overly tolerated and not earnestly corrected, then the real refugees will not receive actual benefits, and the efficiency of relief will be further reduced, which is the responsibility of the local authorities.

The Chairman Personally Reviews the Presidential Election Certificate (Taken at the Lishi Society)

### The Ministry of Finance has already planned for the operating expenses of agencies for the second half of the year. The nine proposed measures have been approved by the Executive Yuan.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The national budget for the second half of the 37th year has not yet been drafted by the competent authority. However, operating expenses urgently need to be planned in advance, and in order to prepare for the treasury appropriation procedures as soon as possible, the Ministry of Finance has recently referred to the precedent of the first half of this year. Before the general budget for the second half of the 37th year is approved and implemented, for the raising of various operating expenses, nine measures have been proposed and have been approved by the Executive Yuan. The main points are as follows: (1) Military expenses will still be pre-allocated one month in advance as usual. (2) Ordinary operating expenses of central agencies will be allocated based on the average of one-sixth of the original budget and additional budget extensions for the first half of the 37th year. For agencies that apply direct allocation of funds, two months will be allocated first, but in remote areas where the monthly expense amount is small, three months may be allocated first. Agencies that apply for fund allocation will pre-allocate three months uniformly. (3) Living subsidies and food rice allowances for central agencies (including business agencies) will be temporarily advanced according to the original agency units and the actual allocation amount in May of the first half of this year. Although there are agencies that apply for direct allocation or allocation of funds, the pre-allocation months and pre-allocation funds are the same, and all are allocated into the treasury account at one time. The receiving agency shall, in accordance with the actual number of people and approved standards, lawfully and realistically withdraw funds from the treasury. (4) Provincial and municipal subsidies will be estimated based on the sum of the original approved budget for the first half of the year and the adjusted and added non-staple food expenses, security officer and soldier salaries, and employee living subsidies. The total amount will be divided by six, and three months will be pre-allocated. This will be deducted after the provincial and municipal subsidies are approved. (5) Main and subsidiary food expenses for public-funded students and accommodated persons will be pre-allocated by the Ministry of Finance for three months based on the sum of the original budget and the additional budget for May. (6) Newly established agencies and staff members will be ordered by the Executive Yuan to be realistically advanced and allocated by the Ministry of Finance, and deducted after the budget is established. (7) The principal and interest of various debts due will be advanced by the Ministry of Finance and deducted after the budget is approved.

### Hovering Among the Peaks: A Two-Day Flight to Survey Mount 積石

— By our reporter Hong Xucai

[This newspaper's special feature] The Mount 積石 survey plane took off from Longhua Airport at 8:00 AM on April 15th, arriving in Lanzhou at 6:00 PM that day. After staying overnight at the Northwest Mansion, it was originally scheduled to fly to Mount 積石 for survey at 6:00 AM the next morning, but due to bad weather, the departure was delayed until 1:00 PM.

The survey plane flew west from Lanzhou, passing about 163 miles in 1 hour and 10 minutes, crossing Guide and arriving at Gonghe. From Gonghe, it turned southwest, flying 40 miles in 35 minutes. Approaching the east side of Lake喀拉海, it reached the airspace above Mount 積石. The route from Lanzhou through Gonghe to Mount 積石 was all mountainous, but the peaks were not high, and the mountains were mostly brown, with green trees, very different from the snow-covered Mount 阿尼瑪卿. As the area belongs to the loess region, the mountain peaks are likely formed of red rock layers.

The survey plane circled above Mount 積石 for about half an hour, but no high peaks were found. The plane proceeded west, and after half an hour, reached Mount 郭洛 on the border of Xikang. This was the highest peak of the day's journey. Radar measurements showed Mount 郭洛 to be 21,000 feet high. Because there were clouds over the east side of Mount 郭洛, the survey plane circled its south side four or five times, taking 20 minutes. It then flew from the south peak to the north peak of Mount 郭洛, taking about 15 minutes. Since there was no possibility of finding higher peaks in the area, the survey plane flew northeast from Mount 郭洛, and after 40 minutes, crossed Mount 阿尼瑪卿 again, turning north. After about 45 minutes, it reached the east side of Lake 鄂陵, flying three circles over it, taking 15 minutes, and observing the surroundings, but no unusual peaks were seen. The clock pointed to 6:00 PM, the sky was getting dark, and it was already past the scheduled time. The survey plane decided to return to Lanzhou immediately, flying directly from the east of Lake 鄂陵 to Lanzhou, taking 1 hour and 35 minutes. When it arrived at the airport, it was already dark, and it relied on lights to land safely.

The survey work had come to an end at this point. The next day, a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) special plane was prepared to carry reporters to Chengdu and then Chongqing before returning to Shanghai. However, after the special plane took off from Lanzhou at 8:00 AM, the pilot, Chen Wenkuan, remembered that the east side of Mount 積石 was covered in dense clouds on the 16th, making measurements impossible. To verify this, he decided to refly the area for another survey. The itinerary for the 17th was as follows: The plane took off from Lanzhou Airport at 8:15 AM, flying southwest along the upper reaches of the Yellow River. After about an hour and a half, it flew to the east side of Mount 積石. Slightly south, it flew for 45 minutes to Mount Zheban, about 20,000 feet high, and entered Xikang territory. After 35 minutes, the towering Mount Gongga appeared in front of them. Because the plane was lower than Mount Gongga, its exact height could not be measured. It was estimated to be around 24,500 feet. At this time, the special plane flew directly to Chengdu, because Chen Wenkuan had searched the entire Mount 積石 area and confirmed that there were no high peaks.

In total, the two-day flight took 11 hours, flying 1,760 miles, at an average speed of 160 miles per hour, and an altitude of about 18,000 feet. The first day, when crossing Mount 積石 and reaching Mount 郭洛, the plane climbed to over 21,000 feet. At this time, the temperature in the plane was 12 degrees below zero Celsius, and the average temperature was maintained at about 9 degrees below zero. The second day, when flying to Mount Gongga, Chen Wenkuan originally planned to raise the plane above the high mountain to measure the exact height of Mount Gongga, but because he discovered that the passengers in the plane could not endure it, he was unsuccessful.

After two days of high-altitude flight, the survey work officially came to an end. But this is only the beginning of a great undertaking. As for how to open the door to the natural treasure house and explore the mysteries of the universe, that still awaits future efforts. Mount 積石 is within Chinese territory, and we look forward to our own people writing this brilliant page in the future history of the world!

Deng Gaozhang, Deputy Manager of CNAC

### In Response to the Serious Situation in Palestine: Britain Urgently Dispatches Troops for Reinforcement; Calls on Arabs and Jews to Ceasefire for Two Days and Nights; Lebanese, Syrian, and Egyptian Governments Deny Dispatching Armed Forces to Participate in the War

[This newspaper's dispatch] London, broadcast on the 2nd: Jerusalem dispatch, today the British side called for a 48-hour ceasefire between the Arab and Jewish sides. In addition, it is learned that British reinforcements and equipment are being continuously sent to Palestine to deal with the new situation there.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 2nd] The British army issued a statement today, the full text of which is as follows: "The situation in Palestine has greatly deteriorated due to the illegal invasion of Jaffa by the Jewish Irgun militia. The military importance of this region takes precedence over other tasks in the Middle East. For the sake of general security, it is necessary to dispatch a large number of infantry, tanks, artillery, and marines to reinforce Palestine." Qualified sources estimate that the current strength of the British army in Palestine is about 25,000.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 2nd] British military authorities announced today that infantry, tanks, artillery, and marines have been urgently dispatched from Cyprus and Malta to Palestine to cope with the seriously deteriorated situation. Previously, both Jewish and Arab sides claimed that regular armies from Middle Eastern Arab countries such as Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt had invaded the Holy Land from the north and south.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 1st] According to Arab and Jewish sources, regular armies from Middle Eastern Arab countries entered Palestine today from the north and south. Powerful forces from Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt crossed the border at dawn. Saudi Arabia, Transjordan, and Iraq have also ordered troops to the war zone, or completed the final preparations for battle. Syrian and Lebanese troops entering the Holy Land have made contact with Jewish sentries. Meanwhile, according to news from Damascus, Syria has apparently mobilized half of its national army to invade Palestine. It is also learned that Transjordan has ordered the armies of six Arab countries to enter the Holy Land together.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 1st] The Jewish Haganah announced on the 1st that Jewish forces had repelled the powerful forces of the Syrian and Lebanese regular armies attacking northern Palestine. The Haganah radio broadcast claimed that two Arab villages near Safed had been occupied by Jewish forces. Safed is in northern Palestine, 10 miles from the borders of Lebanon and Syria.

[Reuters, Tel Aviv, 1st] The British military headquarters in Jerusalem announced that British and Jewish forces had engaged in the largest battle in Jaffa since the UN passed the partition plan. When the Irgun forces attacked Jaffa again after the ceasefire expired, British forces attacked the Jewish forces with armored vehicles, mortars, and direct-fire guns, killing 70 Jews. The British also suffered 6 fatalities. British forces have now entered the Menshiya district occupied by the Haganah. A Haganah headquarters bulletin stated that after the armies of Syria and Lebanon invaded Palestine, fierce battles broke out with the Jewish forces. The Arab armies used artillery and tanks as cover, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. A Haganah spokesperson also announced that two British destroyers had arrived in Jaffa to evacuate Arabs. Arab reinforcements also arrived in Jaffa under British protection. The Arab military headquarters in Damascus recently issued a bulletin announcing that Arab artillery had bombarded Jewish areas of Jerusalem. Fierce fighting is taking place in Harawi and surrounding areas, and 10 Jews have been killed.

[United Press, London, 1st] The British War Office stated on the 1st that it could not confirm that Palestine had been invaded by Arab countries.

[United Press, Beirut, 1st] Lebanese Foreign Minister Farangiyeh denied on the 1st the report from Tel Aviv that armed forces from Syria and Lebanon had invaded northern Palestine.

[United Press, Cairo, 1st] Egyptian Defense Minister Haidar clearly denied on the 1st the report that Egyptian troops had invaded Palestine.

### The UN Is Filled With Despair: The Holy Land Will Become a Battlefield; Jewish Representatives Urge a Halt to Arab Military Actions

[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] The United Nations General Assembly has been listlessly debating the Palestine issue for two weeks, and there is still no solution in sight. It is generally believed that the United Nations will stand by and allow the Arab and Jewish sides to fight each other endlessly. Both sides have uniformly criticized the United States' trusteeship plan in the UN Political Committee. As representatives from various countries left the committee chamber to spend the weekend, most felt that a new war was looming in the Holy Land.

Pessimism can be seen in the fact that the US delegation formally proposed a trusteeship plan. The US knew that there was no hope of passing the plan, so it only proposed this plan for reference purposes, and did not intend to push for a decision even when the political committee reconvened on the 3rd. A US official admitted that the US had exhausted all its efforts to persuade Britain and France to send troops to join the international force, but had failed so far, and there were no signs of London or Paris changing their minds. The Soviet Union and its satellite states are expected to launch a major attack on the trusteeship plan before the first trial vote.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 2nd] It was learned today that there is no hope of preventing the Holy Land from becoming a battlefield for large-scale warfare between Jewish people and the regular armies of Arab countries. Unless a United Nations agency quickly approves a plan to replace the partition plan for Palestine, and Britain and the United States declare their unreserved support, neither the Jewish nor Arab sides will yield too much.

[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] Jewish community representatives tonight urged the Security Council to take swift action to stop Arab armies from invading Palestine. It is said that if the Security Council does not intervene, large-scale war is almost inevitable, which will lead to a major conflagration with unimaginable consequences. The Palestinian Jewish defense forces are determined to resist this new aggression at all costs.

### Judgment of Japanese War Criminals: Will Take Three Months to Complete

Protracted and Lacking Political Significance

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Our country's jurist, Mei Ru'ao, claimed that the eleven judges of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East are currently not only drafting the judgments of the 25 main Japanese war criminals, but are in fact writing a "true history" of Pacific relations over the past 20 years. Mei continued to say that it will take the judges about three months to complete this "historical document," and that the judgment will not be pronounced until July or even early August. According to Judge Mei's estimate, the future judgment will be as long as 1,000 to 2,000 pages, including appendices. Mei concluded with a philosophical tone: "I have indeed realized that, given the rapid changes in the world situation over the past two years, the trial in Tokyo has lost most of its political significance, but I deeply hope that it will not lose its legal and historical significance."

### Inspection of Japanese Reparations: Work Will Be Completed

Adopting a Whole-Batch Equipment Distribution Method

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] The work of inspecting 70% of the reparations goods by representatives of the member states of the Far Eastern Commission is nearing completion. These reparations goods will be distributed among these eleven countries, but transport cannot begin until the commission decides on the distribution ratio. The 30% priority transport is currently progressing slowly.

[United Press, Seoul, 2nd] US military authorities announced today that the South Korean Communist Party is conspiring to disrupt the general election on May 10th.

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 2nd] US military governor of South Korea, Major General Dean, issued Executive Order No. 21 today: "No group may hold parades or demonstrations on May 9th and 10th. Any such actions will be punished as disrupting public order."

[United Press, Seoul, 2nd] Under the instigation of the Communist Party, some Koreans launched large-scale guerrilla warfare on Jeju Island on the 2nd. They attacked a city for three hours, surrounded three villages, and murdered more than seven civilians, four of whom were women. South Korean police reinforcements arrived in Jeju on the 28th and reported that the guerrillas were well-equipped and well-trained. After a three-hour fierce battle, the police defeated the Koreans attacking Dase. Six dead were found in the village. One woman was strangled, and another was stabbed to death. The body of a man was found in the nearby village of Pinni, hacked to death. US reconnaissance planes flew around the area and reported that guerrillas had surrounded the three villages of Pinni, Pamei, and Xinang. Most of the telephone and telegraph lines connecting Jeju City to the villages have been cut.

### Hu Shize Analyzes the Overall Situation in Korea

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Dr. Hu Shize, Secretary-General of the United Nations Commission on Korea, stated to reporters on the 2nd: "The general election originally scheduled for May 10th in South Korea will still be held as scheduled and will not be affected by the North Korean Party Conference." Regarding the future developments in the Korean situation, Hu believed that the following two matters have important decisive effects: First, whether the unification conditions decided by the North Korean Party Conference are accepted by all Korean parties. Second, what is the total number of voters in the upcoming South Korean general election? Regarding the first point, Hu said: The United Nations sincerely hopes that Korea will be unified as soon as possible, but it is also determined not to see it fall under Communist control as a result. Therefore, unless the decisions of the Party Conference can be accepted by all Korean parties, it cannot obtain the support of the United Nations. The current view of the United States is that since North and South Korea are unable to unify under the current situation, it is better for South Korea to become independent first, and then for the South Korean democratically elected government to launch a unification movement, which is easier to start. Regarding the second point, he said that it is difficult to estimate in advance how many people will vote in the South Korean general election, but if the number of voters is too small, it will inevitably cause criticism and have an adverse effect on the Korean situation. Hu's term expires on the 15th of this month, and he will fly back to the United Nations headquarters in the middle of the month.

He said that both parties are brutal, callous, and shameless, and can use other parties that do not sympathize with their goals. They are both good at underground work, eroding from within, and colluding with disloyal elements. It is a great mistake to think that the Communist Party is part of the left wing.

Memorial Oration

The following is the memorial oration: "On this second day of the fifth month of the thirty-seventh year of the Republic of China, Zhang Yi and others respectfully offer incense, flowers, and clear tea to the spirit of Mr. Ye Qiuyuan of Yuhang, saying: Alas, Heaven is unkind, cutting down our world's hero. A flourishing life suddenly ends, forever sealed in Yaoqiong. You, sir, had a broad and profound spirit, studied abroad, and early on gained a renowned name. You learned from others' mistakes and welcomed them yourself. You soared high and accomplished much. Displaying your talents, you spoke powerfully in forums. Teaching in academies, you were wholeheartedly devoted to the program. No matter how small or large, everything you touched, you poured your heart into it. Evaluating people, your judgment was highly regarded. But you were born in an unfortunate time, when insults and oppressions arose daily. Evil forces acted recklessly, and chaotic signs could not be stopped. As a scholar, you stood firm and steadfast, enduring hardship and danger. You proclaimed the atrocities of the enemy and described their brutal actions. Not out of defamation but to rouse the allied forces. You analyzed issues with clarity, dispelling the haze of confusion. But your good plans were not completed, and you were ordered to travel west. Your great mouth should have remained open, teaching Jing and Shu, your upright spirit shone like the sun and stars. Traveling abroad, you consistently maintained integrity. The enemy leader was defeated, and the fighting subsided. In Shanghai, the atmosphere was glorious and uplifting. When you arrived, everyone eagerly sought your opinion. You expressed your views freely and boldly. You were dedicated to God and devoted yourself to religious service, expounding profound doctrines with sharp insights. You remained humble, and farmers admired your abilities. You laughed and spoke gently, avoiding disputes. Your heart was broad and serene, entrusting your feelings to green waters. You enjoyed gatherings with friends, and your talents became clearer. How could such a great talent not reach his full potential? A moment of suffering ended a lifetime. The news spread, shocking everyone far and wide. With this person gone, who will take his place? We are honored to have known you and are filled with grief. We offer these simple tributes, hoping they will comfort your spirit. May you rest in peace."

### Xu Jizhuang's Extradition to Be Smoothly Resolved: New Evidence Obtained in the Far Ocean Gold Speculation Case

Regarding the external case of Xu Jizhuang's suspected corruption, the Far Ocean Company's unprecedented large-scale black market gold speculation was reported to the municipal military authorities by foreigner Du Luisui.

Recently, the economic department of the municipal military authorities summoned each person involved in the case and questioned them in detail about Xu Jizhuang's involvement in the joint operation of the black market gold trade.

According to reporters, the accounting vouchers of the Far Ocean Company's black market gold trading show that a person surnamed He from Hunan Province deposited 800 taels of gold in one transaction.

### General Commodity Prices Remain Calm and Lack Momentum for Growth

Due to numerous factors favoring the bearish side this past week, coupled with the fact that Mr. Bei Zuyi, responsible for the U.S. loan, which is the most powerful element in stabilizing commodity prices, is already on his way back to the country, indicating implementation is imminent, the overall market sentiment was generally calm and lacked momentum for growth, except for some positive signs towards the weekend. Compared to the closing prices of the previous weekend, only a few commodities, such as sugar, were relatively firm due to seasonal factors and adjustments in the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar. The fluctuations of other items were minimal. Based on the wholesale price index compiled by this publication, the index increased by only 1.09% last week.

In terms of credit conditions, the past week saw mixed conditions. The National Bank's clearing situation was tight on Mondays and Fridays, with net inflows around 500 billion, while the remaining days saw little net inflow. Wednesday actually saw a net outflow of 14.2 billion. The black market interest rates frequently decreased, dropping from 27% on Monday to 24% on Wednesday, and then hovering around 25%. Generally, commodity prices have slowed their rise since the second half of March and have maintained a stable state for a considerable period. This publication has previously reported on the main reasons in detail. The following is an analysis of the relevant factors from the past week:

First, the recent increases in the official exchange rate have consistently led to price increases in the market, especially for financial commodities and stocks, which react quickly and closely. However, since the government increased the official exchange rate on April 6, it has remained stable for more than three weeks until the end of last week. Rumors of adjustments have repeatedly surfaced and subsided, reducing a significant stimulus factor for commodity prices.

Second, the widening war zones, with the Northeast in imminent danger and fierce fighting in North China, make it difficult to claim stability even in Central China. Transportation in various areas is severely disrupted, leading to stagnant sales for merchants and reduced actual demand. Shanghai is experiencing an accumulation of inventory and even abnormal phenomena such as work stoppages and production cuts. Furthermore, during this time of suppression of rebellion, the government's economic controls are constantly emerging, causing genuine distress for businesses. This has led to a serious economic crisis, namely the relocation of industrial production equipment to the south and the large-scale flow of speculative capital southward. Conversely, in Hong Kong and Guangdong, this has caused price increases and a sharp decline in the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. This characteristic can be observed in the recent two-week contraction of the exchange rate from 8.78 Hong Kong dollars per million legal tender to just over 7 Hong Kong dollars. Regarding the industrial production equipment relocated to Hong Kong, for example, in the textile industry, it is claimed that no fewer than a dozen factories have already opened or are preparing to open, with a total of approximately 190,000 spindles.

Third, according to Ren Xianqun, chairman of the People's Food Allocation Committee, the first phase of the government's rice policy, which is a trial run for four months, will expire at the end of June. July, August, and September are the lean months between harvests. If the allocation of rice is not continued, it will have adverse consequences. Therefore, the committee unanimously decided to continue the allocation. This decision will have a significant impact on stabilizing rice prices, and fluctuations in rice prices will play a major role in overall commodity prices.

Fourth, in addition to the aforementioned more obvious reasons for the recent stability of commodity prices, psychological factors are also very important. Because commodity prices have been stable for a considerable period and negative factors still exist, the public's expectations for commodity prices differ from the previous trend of continued increases. This psychological expression can be found in both the stock and commodity markets. In the stock market, both buyers and sellers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude, and trading is scarce. In the commodity market, goods are being released, supply exceeds demand, and actual sales are weak.

Fifth, because Shanghai's commodity prices have reached a considerable level, some items are more expensive than in other cities, such as the current market price of cotton cloth in Guangzhou, which is lower than in Shanghai. Therefore, demand from Guangdong merchants is very weak.

In addition, new measures related to commodity prices last week include:

First, the National Bank's Discount and Loan Committee was officially established on the 27th. This year's National Bank loan policy was previously determined by the Four Joint Offices as two major categories: national policy loans and production enterprise loans. National policy loans should be reviewed by the secretariat of the Four Joint Offices in consultation with the Central Bank and then submitted to the Board of Directors for approval or reported to the chairman and vice chairman. All business loan cases will no longer be directly handled by the Four Joint Offices but should be referred to the Central Bank and specialized banks for review. Subsequently, on April 9, the Four Joint Offices passed the Central Bank's Discount and Loan Committee Organization Regulations at its 366th Board of Directors meeting, stipulating the committee's duties as: A. Matters related to the decision of the Central Bank's discount policy; B. Review of applications from fellow members; C. Approval of rediscount and remortgage interest rates; D. Other matters related to discounts and loans. At the establishment of this Discount and Loan Committee, President Zhang of the National Bank stated, "From now on, the National Bank will not directly issue loans but will only handle rediscounts and remortgages for each bank. State-owned and commercial banks will be treated equally. The targets of loans are healthy production enterprises that meet the current needs of the country, thereby achieving the healthy operation of each bank and cultivating good commercial paper to guide funds into production." From this, it can be seen that the Central Bank is gradually moving towards becoming a "bank of banks." During this period of economic turmoil, price fluctuations are closely related to discount policies. It is not easy to detect the choices between supporting legitimate production and inducing hoarding and speculation. We hope that it will be handled well, and we will wait and see for factual proof.

Second, the long-awaited short-term treasury bills were officially issued by the National Bank on the 30th, initially for a period of one month. The discount rate will be determined daily by the Treasury Bill Interest Rate Committee. The discount rate on the 30th was set at 87.3.

Third, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee previously prohibited the transportation of cotton yarn and cloth to the south from February 24 to stabilize the rise in cotton yarn and cloth prices in Shanghai. The committee believes that the market price of cotton yarn and cloth has recently stabilized and decided to lift the ban on the transportation of cotton yarn and cloth to the south from April 25, and announced this to the public.

Under the aforementioned conditions, the general trend of commodity prices last week remained relatively stable. Foreign stocks showed some improvement, while the Chinese stock market was more subdued. However, because there was no for Chinese stocks, and banks and securities firms aggressively bought it up, coupled with rumors of currency reform in the market, the rising trend was firm. More details are covered in the stock market section of this publication below. Because sales of cotton yarn and cloth were stagnant and domestic demand was also weak, merchants were mostly focused on selling. Factory inventories piled up, and the market was flat. For example, 42-count cotton yarn hovered around 235 million, and Shuangma 21-count cotton yarn did not exceed 160 million. The closing price of Longtou fine cloth on the weekend was very close to the closing price of the previous weekend. The rice market experienced minor fluctuations because of the Civil Affairs Commission's decision to continue the food ration program in July, August, and September, which softened market sentiment. However, by the weekend, the Civil Affairs Commission announced an increase in the retail price of rice for the next period, stimulating rice prices to rise. For example, premium white rice in the North Shanghai market exceeded the 4 million mark on the weekend, closing at 4.15 million. The trend of coarse grains was also quite narrow. The flour market initially declined and then rebounded. For example, Bingshun No. 1 flour fell from 1.4 million per bag on Monday to 1.385 million after Wednesday, then rebounded on the weekend, exceeding the 1.4 million mark. Due to seasonal factors, sales of sugar gradually increased, and the Taiwan dollar exchange rate was adjusted. The allocation price of Taiwan sugar increased, with all grades of Taiwan sugar increased by 500,000 per bag from the 18th period. The market price showed some positive signs. Other commodities, such as chemicals and metals, experienced minimal increases, while building materials trended downward.

### Monetary and Financial Situation

(1) Credit Conditions and Black Market Interest Rates

Generally speaking, credit conditions in Shanghai this past week remained relatively relaxed. Although speculative funds have been flowing into the city, the extremely low general purchasing power has caused buyers to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. The resulting oversupply of funds in the market is also a factor that cannot be ignored. One financial industry insider commented, "The current abundance of funds is the most significant seen this year. This is partly due to the public's wait-and-see attitude towards commodity prices and partly due to the clear evidence of severe inflation." This is a truly insightful statement.

In the commercial banking sector, the demand for loans is low, while the supply of funds is becoming increasingly abundant. As a result, the black market interest rates have continued to decline, dropping to 24% on Wednesday and Thursday, and even falling below the interest rate for interbank lending, to around 20%. As for the off-exchange interest rates for securities firms, they fell from 22 yuan on Tuesday to 19 yuan on Wednesday, and short positions also dropped by 3 yuan. Since the official establishment of the National Bank's Discount and Loan Committee on Tuesday, there has been a belief that lending will be restored soon, making interbank lending even more difficult. The net output of funds from banks after the 60th day decreased from over 390 billion on Monday to 20 billion on Wednesday, indicating the abundance of funds within the industry. Although there was a net outflow of over 590 billion on Thursday, interbank lending remained limited due to the large reserves held by banks. There was also a very abundant supply of cash. On Monday, banks used 230-300 billion in cash to settle outstanding obligations with the National Bank, and the amount of cash settled on Thursday also reached around 100 billion.

The total net inflow of funds to state-owned banks and treasuries from Monday to Thursday was as high as over 1.1 trillion. However, after deducting the 980 billion in fixed deposits submitted by commercial banks to the National Bank over the four days, the net inflow to state-owned banks and treasuries was still 200 billion. However, this inflow did not seem to have any impact on the market.

Short-term treasury bills were officially issued on Friday, with a discount rate equivalent to

### Strengthening Liaison Training for Local Land, Sea, and Air Force Officers; Collective Corps Operations; Ministry of National Defense Dispatches Senior Officials to Shanghai to Preside; Garrison Headquarters Actively Prepares to Hold Training in Three Batches

The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters recently received an order from the Ministry of National Defense stating that due to the special environment of the city and the large number of stationed troops, although the Garrison Headquarters is in charge of overall command, there are still imperfections in terms of actual liaison and combat. Therefore, to meet the needs of the environment, it is urgently necessary to conduct joint and unified training and hold "Joint Collective Corps Operations Training for Senior Land, Sea, and Air Force Officers." Military organizations in the city include the First Naval Base Command, the Shanghai Port Command, the Wusong Fortress Command, the Air Force Supply Command, the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, the 202nd Division of the Youth Army, the 9th Regiment of the Military Police, and the Police Bureau, possessing substantial military strength. The Garrison Headquarters is now actively preparing for this training, aiming to hold it in the shortest possible time. The training is planned to be conducted in three batches, with bureau chiefs, section chiefs, inspector generals, and chiefs of staff as the first batch, section heads and directors as the second batch, and section members and other relevant personnel as the third batch. Each person will be given appropriate operational training knowledge within the shortest possible time according to their talents, strengthening mutual communication and understanding of collective corps operations. The Ministry of National Defense has dispatched senior officials to Shanghai to preside over the training, and the commanders of various military organizations in the city will be important responsible persons in the training, with the aim of unifying the pace and coherence of the city's land, sea, and air forces. As for the training location, it has also been selected within a certain district of the city, held in a large building. The training time for each batch is relatively short, so the training subjects are extremely essential.

### The Civil Affairs Committee's Review Meeting; Miao Jiaming Expresses Appreciation to Staff; More Than 80 Million US Dollars Worth of Food Will Soon Be Shipped to China

The Shanghai Municipal Food Allocation Committee convened its seventh work review meeting yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. Director Miao Jiaming of the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling American Relief Supplies delivered a speech, stating that the first phase of rice distribution was originally scheduled to end at the end of June, but it has since been decided to continue.

The new US aid to China bill includes over 300 million US dollars in economic aid, of which more than 80 million US dollars is entirely for food, which will soon be shipped to China. Therefore, the rice supply is abundant, and the full-scale distribution will continue without any problems. Mr. Miao expressed his appreciation to the colleagues and staff of the committee, issuing bonuses as a form of spiritual encouragement. Subsequently, Grain Ministry advisor Hurtle delivered a speech, strongly praising the city's full-scale distribution system. Under the leadership of the current chairman, it has received the support of five million citizens throughout the city and achieved good results. He hoped that they would continue their efforts to seek progress. Finally, the committee's colleagues raised opinions, which Chairman Miao answered one by one on the spot, and the meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM.

### Fisheries Materials Symposium Held Today in the Capital

### Lending Fishing Vessels for Armed Escort Is a Violation of the Agreement and Is Not Permitted

[Report from Our Newspaper] Jiang-Zhejiang fisheries organizations had previously jointly requested the Rehabilitation Affairs Committee to allocate two new fishing vessels for arming in order to prevent pirates from harassing fishermen while fishing. It is now learned that the Rehabilitation Affairs Committee, after receiving the letter, conducted several studies and ultimately concluded that this action would violate the UNRRA's agreement with China and could not be approved. A letter of apology has been sent to the organizations. According to the agreement between UNRRA and the Chinese government, UNRRA's supplies to China are only for rehabilitation, reconstruction, and relief, and may not be used for military purposes. If UNRRA's fishing vessels are now equipped with weapons, it would be a violation of the purpose of relief supplies.

### Galvanized Iron Industry Appeals That Raw Material Panic Will Lead to a Dead End

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Galvanized Iron Industry Association, due to the panic of raw materials, the industry will be in a dead end. Yesterday, they received reporters and reported on the recent situation of the industry. The main raw materials of the industry, such as galvanized iron, tinplate, zinc sheet, and black iron sheet, rely on imports from abroad. They are then processed and manufactured by the industry into daily necessities, various mechanical accessories, and moisture-proof packaging for export trade. There are more than 1,200 shops in the city engaged in this industry, with more than 10,000 workers. However, since the foreign exchange control, the main raw material galvanized iron sheet is not allowed to be imported, and other quota-limited imported raw materials are monopolized by importers and hardware vendors, causing the industry to only be able to purchase raw materials under the double exorbitant profit exploitation of importers and hardware vendors, and the selling price is more than 2 million times higher than before the war. Due to the panic of raw materials and high costs, it is difficult to maintain, and more than 200 companies have already closed down. Recently, the industry has sent representatives to appeal to the Import Control Committee, the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and other departments, requesting the authorities to allow the import of galvanized iron sheets and to relax the import volume of other raw materials. In the quota allocation of the imported products, the industry is allowed to join the allocation.
