### Beiping Defense War Gradually Unfolds: All Bandits at Nanyuan Airport and Outside Deshengmen Annihilated; Rumor States That Zuoyi Expressed Determination to Fight to the End

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 17th] Fierce battles are taking place today on the southeast and west sides of the Beiping suburbs. The National Army has made considerable gains in its offensives on the east and west fronts. At 10:00 AM, about 300 scattered bandits were discovered near the Wanzi area of Nanyuan Airport. National Army troops stationed in the southern suburbs went to suppress them, and after two hours of fierce fighting, all of the bandits were annihilated. There is no trace of bandits at Nanyuan Airport. Another unit of the National Army launched an attack towards the Wanshou Temple area on the morning of the 17th, engaging in battle on the west side of the area. The fighting was fierce from morning to noon. At 10:00 AM, over a thousand bandits took advantage of a gap to flee to the vicinity of ten or so miles outside Deshengmen. A unit of the National Army surrounded the bandits, and after fierce fighting until 1:00 PM, the majority of the bandits were annihilated. They fled westward, and the National Army's field artillery units pursued them with firepower. Furthermore, a joint force of the National Army's infantry, cavalry, and artillery launched a combined encirclement operation last night towards the southeast of Pingdong, Tongxian, and the arc of the north and south of Majuqiao. They engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits west of Tongxian and northwest of Majuqiao throughout the night. This morning, the land and air forces coordinated to continue a fierce pursuit. By 1:00 PM, the bandits' momentum was broken, and the National Army had advanced to the outskirts of Tongxian. It is reported that the bandits attacking Beiping are the 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, and 11th columns of Lin Biao's forces. The 5th and 8th columns are in Pingdong, and the 4th, 11th, and 7th columns are in the western suburbs of Beiping.

[Our Correspondent in Tianjin, 17th] The military situation around Tianjin is becoming increasingly tense. Small groups of bandits have been discovered both north and south of Tianjin, and a battle could break out at any moment. The situation in Tanggu remains stable. The train service between Tianjin and Tanggu is running smoothly as usual. Train service north of Tianjin is still running to Yangcun.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 17th] The Political Warfare Department of the North China剿總 has just released the following comprehensive battle report for the Beiping suburbs on the 17th: In defense of the Beiping suburbs, the National Army lured the bandit forces closer to the city suburbs, and the main force is gradually launching decisive battles. Today, the entire front launched attacks in separate directions, killing and wounding over 4,000 bandits, inflicting a significant blow on the bandits and achieving fruitful results. From morning to dusk, the suburbs echoed with artillery fire throughout the day, fully demonstrating the intensity of the fighting. In the northwest of the city, a part of the bandit's 5th column first conducted probing activities towards Wanshou Temple, Hongguoyuan, Baishiqiao, and other places. The National Army immediately pursued and suppressed them, and the majority of the bandit forces were annihilated. In the afternoon, the main force of the bandits, about 5,000 men, gradually joined the battle, giving the National Army the opportunity to display its power and annihilate the bandits, launching concentrated artillery fire and fiercely bombarding them, and covering the infantry's advance. Although the bandits repeatedly launched stubborn counterattacks, they were ultimately suppressed by our intense firepower. In the Baishiqiao area east of Wanshou Temple alone, an entire bandit battalion risked death to attack, but they were all annihilated in front of our positions. It is estimated that about 1,700 bandits were killed or wounded in the northwest of the city. The battle ended victoriously in the evening. The National Army, which attacked Majuqiao in the southeast of Beiping, launched a fierce attack on the bandits with superior firepower after dawn this morning. After fierce fighting until the afternoon, over 2,000 bandits were killed or wounded. The bandits' morale wavered, and they gradually retreated. The National Army continued to fire fiercely and strike hard, and the fighting finally came to a temporary halt in the evening. Furthermore, the National Army at Nanyuan annihilated over 300 bandits near the airport this morning, ensuring the safety of the airport. Looking at the situation today, the National Army attacking in all directions has achieved significant gains. The morale of the National Army is extremely high, and they have a firm grasp of victory. They will surely make the Lin bandits who entered the pass recognize the strength of the National Army's fighting will and combat power, and lay a foundation for the National Army's future decisive battles to achieve inevitable victory.

[Another Dispatch] In the fighting in the Beiping suburbs, the National Army is doing its best to protect cultural relics and historical sites, and the safety of the people, in order to avoid damage from artillery fire. However, the bandit army is actually firing artillery shells into the city. Today, the 5th column of bandit forces fought with the National Army in the Wanshou Temple area throughout the day. The bandit artillery blindly fired shells towards the ancient city. At 5:10 PM, three shells landed in the Da Houkeng area inside Fuchengmen, one after another. The first shell landed in the Xiao Gongjiang Ying, wounding a woman of about thirty years old. The second shell landed in the Dong Gongjiang Ying, but no one was injured. The third shell landed in the Xi Gongjiang Ying, wounding two soldiers from a certain unit. Other losses are still under investigation.

[United Press, Beiping, 17th] Fu Zuoyi announced at a meeting of military and government leaders last night that he had decided to defend Beiping and Tianjin, even if it meant fighting to the last man. Fu personally instructed on military matters and measures to maintain public order. Furthermore, Ji Chairman Chu Xichun informed the people today to remain calm and not to be afraid. It is claimed that there are 120,000 regular troops and 30,000 militia in the Beiping area to undertake the defense, and there is no need to worry about food shortages. Furthermore, the 剿總 has ordered the demolition of all buildings along the city walls to prevent them from being used by the Communist army.

### The Bengbu-Suxian Campaign Has Come to a Temporary End; The National Army Has Completed Its New Deployment; The Southern Expeditionary Force Continues to Capture Many Strongholds

[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 17th] The Bengbu-Suxian campaign developed until yesterday, and the breakout of Huang's army has come to a temporary end. Although the progress of the National Army in the battles that have taken place in the past three weeks has not been as satisfactory as desired, the blow to the bandit forces of Liu Bocheng, Chen Geng, and Chen Yi in the Central China region has been extremely deep and significant. In particular, Huang Wei's army stubbornly defended Shuangduiji, attracting the main force of the bandits, and fiercely attacking them for as long as twenty days and nights. Huang's army has indeed been decimated, but this was to be expected in such a massive campaign. Comparing the losses on both sides, Generals Huang Wei and Hu Lian have truly completed their arduous task with the most brilliant results. According to the news I received this morning, Huang's army broke out in three directions. Two of the routes were commanded by Generals Hu and Huang, and they moved in the southeast direction. The remaining part was led by a certain vehicle commander and launched an attack to the west. As of this morning, except for Hu Lian, who arrived in Bengbu yesterday and flew to Nanjing on a special plane this morning, and a part of Huang Wei's force, no further contact has been established. According to intelligence from the Sui district, a large unit of the National Army was discovered in the Mengcheng-Guoyang area yesterday, which may be this force. Based on this major turning point in the battle situation, Li Yannian's army completed its redeployment in an active manner within twelve hours last night after launching a final strike against the remaining bandits on the Baogaji-Renheji line yesterday. Starting today, the National Army has deployed its positions on the south bank of the Huai River and on the Wuhe-Caolaoji-Fenghuai line north of the Huai River. There is absolutely no problem in the Huainan area. Li Yannian also returned to Bengbu this morning, and his army headquarters has moved here. As of the time of this dispatch, the bandit situation on the opposite side is still extremely chaotic, and it is impossible to understand their movements. According to the military's judgment, after suffering a major blow in the past twenty days, the bandit army may be unable to advance southward. If the bandit army has any ambitions to invade the south in the future, the most worrying area would be the curved areas of the Huai River on the east and west sides of Bengbu. As for the army under the command of Du Yuming on the northern front, except for Sun's army, which suffered a slight setback in the past few days, the combat effectiveness of the Qiu and Li armies is still extremely strong, and they continue to attack southward. It is heard that Du sent a telegram to Liu Zhi yesterday morning, stating that if there are no problems with supplies, he is confident of achieving victory.

[United Press, Bengbu, 17th] The Northern Expeditionary Force is advancing steadily, and the sound of artillery is getting farther and farther away from here. The atmosphere in the city is peaceful, but military transportation is frequent. The first batch of approximately 5,000 men from the 12th Army Corps transferred from Central China have arrived here to reinforce the defense. According to a spokesman for the East China National Army Headquarters: The two armies are fighting for the final five minutes of decisive battle on the Hebei front. In the future, the Communist army will need a long period of rest before it can launch another attack.

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 17th] After the Southern Expeditionary Force won victories in Gengzhuang (northeast of Yongcheng), Liuyuan (east of Yongcheng), and other places on the 15th, it continued to put pressure eastward and southward on Yongcheng. Yesterday, it captured more than ten villages and towns, including Liuyuan, Zhangzhuang, and Xiaoliu'ao, killing and wounding over 1,100 bandits. The battle is continuing.

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 17th] According to military news, the Qiu and Li armies of the National Army have been advancing southward for several days. On the 17th, they defeated the 3rd Column of bandits at Liulou, annihilating over 2,000 bandits. The bandits launched two reinforcements and counterattacks, but were repelled. Further news: After the Huang army of our Southern Expeditionary Force and the Li army of the Northern Expeditionary Force joined forces, they are now concentrating their forces in the Jiuwan and Wohe area, coordinating with the Li army of the Northern Expeditionary Force, and continuing to attack the bandits.

[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 17th] Due to the significant developments on the Suxian-Zha battlefield, Bengbu seems to be placed in a garrison position. The residents here are waiting for the development of the situation with a calm state of mind. Vehicles are crowded at Bengbu Station, and trains are constantly entering and exiting. Military transportation is busy. People from other places living in Bengbu have been trying to return south since last night. The hotel where I am staying has been full at times and deserted at other times in the past twenty-four hours. The changes have been enormous. Currently, there are only a few people from our newspaper and the Central News Agency stationed in Bengbu. Furthermore, the curfew here has been moved forward to begin at 7:00 PM starting today.

Northbound passenger trains have resumed normal departures starting on the 17th. The strength of the railway protection forces along the line has been strengthened, and the safety of train travel can be ensured in the future.

### Legislators Raise Questions About Soldiers' Treatment and Wounded Soldiers' Medical Care; Guo Chan Attends the Legislative Yuan Meeting to Answer

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] The Legislative Yuan held its 29th meeting of the second session on the 17th, chaired by Chen Lifu. After reporting on matters in the morning, they proceeded with inquiries, which were answered by Guo Chan, Chen Likai, Jiang Menglin, and others from the Joint Logistics Headquarters and the Rural Reconstruction Commission. In the afternoon, after passing Yao Tingfang's proposal on the method of converting gold, they began discussing matters. When voting on the articles of the draft organization law of the Ministry of Social Affairs, it was discovered that there were only 129 members present, which was less than the legal quorum. They barely passed two cases, one being the approval of the Foreign Affairs Committee's preparation for the renewal of the agreement between China and Hong Kong regarding the customs affairs of the Jishui Gate area, and the other being the retroactive approval of the declaration of temporary martial law in the jurisdiction of the Wuhu Command and between Jiangning and Dongliu. At this time, even more members had left the meeting, and there were fewer than 70 people present. The meeting could not proceed, and all cases were left for discussion at the next meeting. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Logistics Guo Chan, and Chairman of the Rural Reconstruction Commission Jiang Menglin, were invited to attend the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 17th to accept questions from the legislators and answer them on the spot. Food Minister Guan Jiyu, Health Minister Zhou Yichun, Deputy Director of the Military Medical Department Chen Likai, and many other senior staff members also attended. This inquiry was caused by the observations of legislators Zhao Huimo and Luo Heng during their visit to the Xuzhou battlefield. A total of six or seven people spoke and asked questions, focusing on the issues of the treatment of soldiers at the front line and the medical care of wounded soldiers, including the slow payment of salaries to soldiers at the front, the fact that officers and soldiers could not get enough to eat, the poor quality of rice, the small amount of non-staple food allowance, the lack of motor vehicles for military transportation at the front, while military vehicles in the rear transported furniture and luggage, the lack of care for wounded soldiers, the lack of medicine, the insufficient number of military doctors, the fact that many seriously wounded soldiers sacrificed as a result, the lack of suitable houses to accommodate those transported to the rear, and the inhumanity of using open cars to transport soldiers by train, and so on. Zhao Huimo even brought back a bag of rice samples from the front and asked Guo to take a look.

Guo Expressed Shame and Emotion at the Opinions of the Committee Members

In his reply, Guo Chan expressed shame and emotion at the opinions of the committee members. Guo stated that improving the morale of the front line requires the efforts of the rear. The Joint Logistics Headquarters has let down the soldiers and wounded soldiers, and in the future, it should raise its vigilance, fully prepare, and improve. Guo then answered questions separately on salary payment procedures, the quality of rice, and the amount of the non-staple food allowance. He stated that salary payments are made by receiving funds from the Ministry of Finance, and it is stipulated that monthly salaries must be paid in full by the 5th of the following month at the latest. The rice is delivered by the Ministry of Food, and there were standards for acceptance. This time, because the rice was rushed, there were 6,000 large bags of inferior rice. Guo admitted that the rice sample brought back by Zhao did not meet the standards. He also said that the Joint Logistics Department had requested that cooked rice be issued, but this was not approved. The non-staple food allowance has been increased to 50 yuan per month since December, and wounded soldiers have been given an additional food allowance to improve nutrition.

Hoping to Improve the Treatment of Wounded Soldiers by Mobilizing Public Assistance

Regarding the issue of wounded soldiers, Deputy Director of the Military Medical Department Chen Likai answered. Chen pointed out that the current medical personnel, equipment, and medicines are all insufficient, and the treatment of wounded soldiers is also poor. The only way to improve is to mobilize the public, improve the transportation of wounded soldiers, mobilize the faculty and students of medical colleges across the country to assist hospitals in the rear, and mobilize the faculty and students of the National Defense Medical College to work at the front. As for medical equipment and supplies, a batch may be obtained when US aid arrives at the end of this month or early next month. Chen also pointed out that the most important thing is the lack of funding, and asked the legislators to support an increase.

Chairman Jiang Menglin of the Rural Reconstruction Commission Said that it has not Moved to Guangzhou

Regarding the inquiries to the Rural Reconstruction Commission, the committee members focused on the commission's organizational structure, work, and funding, and criticized the fact that the commission moved to Guangzhou before the government. Jiang Menglin replied that it was close to adjournment time, but the meeting was extended by half an hour. Jiang explained the nature and work of the commission in detail. He stated that the commission assists the government and social organizations in reconstructing rural areas and cooperates with local governments and social organizations. The commission itself is not an executive agency. The total funding is US$27.5 million, which is obtained from the sale of US aid materials, of which only US$2.5 million is used for its administrative expenses. Jiang said that the commission has organizations in various places in the rear. There are three of our members, and two are currently in the capital. The commission has not moved to Qingzhou.

### The Change of Policy on Gold Conversion is Severely Damaging to Credibility

Requesting the Executive Yuan to Instruct the Ministry of Finance to Reply

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] The ever-changing method of redeeming gold for gold yuan deposits has attracted the attention of the legislators. At the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 17th, legislators Yao Tingfang and others proposed a temporary motion, questioning the financial authorities and the Central Bank as to why they initially allowed unlimited exchange of gold, leading to the activities of scalpers, and then changed it to a limit of five taels. This method was implemented for only one day, and then it was changed to a limit of one tael. The financial authorities are contradicting themselves and changing their policies frequently, how can they gain the trust of the people? Nothing is more damaging to the government's credibility than this. The President of the Central Bank should be asked to come to the Legislative Yuan to answer. After discussion at the meeting, it was decided to change it to an inquiry case and request the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Finance to sign and reply.

### Hoffman's Answers in Shanghai Press Conference

[This City News] The China Division of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) released on the 17th the record of questions and answers at a press conference held by ECA Administrator Hoffman at the Shanghai Citibank Main Building on December 13th. The full text is as follows:

(Question) Does Your Excellency believe that purely relief work by the ECA can have a chance to continue under a communist government or a coalition government?

(Answer) This broad question is difficult to answer unless we clearly understand the form of the successor coalition government. Otherwise, I don't know what should happen in the future. I think that if it is a coalition government representing all the people, then I will recommend continuing relief. However, I do not know whether my recommendation will be accepted. I will make this recommendation. If it is a coalition government in name only, but completely controlled by the communists, then I don't think our government will approve the continuation of this aid.

I will add an indirect answer to the above question, that is, the basic concept of establishing the ECA, which was mentioned by Secretary of State Marshall in his speech at Harvard University on June 5 last year. At that time, Mr. Marshall said: "Our policy is not directed against any country or doctrine, but against hunger, poverty, distress and chaos, and its purpose should be the recovery of the normal economic situation in the world, so as to produce a political and social state that can tolerate the system of freedom." If the government to be established in the future allows the continued existence of the system of freedom, I believe that my government will be willing to accept the recommendation to continue assistance.

(Question) May I ask whether the main purpose is to help the government or help the people?

(Answer) This question is very simple. The main purpose of the ECA is to help the people. Furthermore, I think the only thing that can make us stop is if we believe that the future government will enslave its people, then continuing aid will lose its meaning. If the situation of allowing the continued existence of the system of freedom and allowing the people to maintain freedom remains unchanged, then I believe that the aid whose purpose is supervised by us will continue to exist.

(Question) I think it will take a considerable amount of time to determine whether the coalition government truly represents the people. Does Your Excellency think that aid can be carried out conditionally during that period, such as freedom of the press and widespread free education?

(Answer) The answer to this question is: if during that period, we cannot determine whether the coalition government allows the existence of a free system and allows the freedom of the people – during this period, we will recommend continued assistance, with the same conditions as exist now.

(Question) Based on what you have heard, what kind of coalition government will be accepted? In other words, is a coalition government in which the Communist Party occupies 51% of the cabinet positions and includes the Prime Minister acceptable?

(Answer) I don't believe that governments can be measured with a ruler. You can only wait and then determine the nature of the government from its actual actions. In other words, our interest lies in whether the government allows free people to remain free. If the new government starts to implement the usual communist practices, such as prohibiting freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and liquidating enemies, then our answer will be "no." On the other hand, if after the establishment of the new government, we cannot immediately understand its nature—if the new government allows what we believe to be the main conditions for preserving freedom to continue to exist, then we will continue to provide assistance within our scope. I will also tell you the following for reference: the current plan we are implementing will be completed in April next year, so what we are discussing is only what to do in the next three to four months, which will affect the form of assistance that our government may pass in the next year.

(Question) Will religious freedom be considered a major item in the conditions?

(Answer) This question is very good because it is very easy to answer. The answer is undoubtedly "yes". We will not cooperate with a coalition government that suppresses religious freedom.

(Question) Based on the above, can I say that if the restrictions imposed on political and religious freedom in the future are no greater than they are now, then the ECA will continue its plan in the same procedure?

(Answer) What I see now that hinders freedom is martial law. If it is only like this in the future, then the answer to your question will be "yes". (The following article turns to the third edition)

### Hoffman Returns to the United States via Japan; Lunches with MacArthur

[United Press Tokyo, 17th] Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) Administrator Hoffman declared on the 17th that his opinions on the United States' aid to China's coalition government, published in Shanghai, have been misinterpreted by some Shanghai journalists. Hoffman, after arriving here from Seoul, said that he had said too much about China's affairs. Hoffman will return to the United States by plane at 7:00 pm on the 17th after having lunch with MacArthur. He pointed out that he was deeply impressed by the progress of South Korea. No matter what happens to China in the future, the United States has a good opportunity to have a solid position in South Korea.

### Editorial: The Touchstone of Shanghai Citizens

After the establishment of the Shanghai All Circles Self-Salvation and National Salvation Joint Association, the Special Self-Defense Donation Raising Committee was also established on the 16th. The meeting then resolved that the expenses for defending Shanghai would be tentatively set at 300 million Gold Yuan, and passed three measures for raising special donations: (1) Starting from New Year's Day next year, the land price tax in this city will be increased by 5 per thousand, which is estimated to generate 120 million Gold Yuan; (2) The goods tax will also be subject to a special self-defense donation attached in accordance with the current practice of attaching military and winter relief donations from January next year; (3) Materials sealed during the price-limited period will be subject to a 1/10 levy to be used as a self-defense donation.

Defending Shanghai is the business of the 5 million citizens of Shanghai. Under the principle of "those who have strength contribute strength, those who have money contribute money," these three measures are all reasonable measures and will be happily followed by the people of the city.

As the war has shifted to the Huai River Basin, the citizens of Shanghai have long felt the threat of "fire reaching their homes" psychologically. Therefore, the general wealthy people hold the philosophy of "not living in a dangerous country" and have flocked to fly far away, trying to save their lives abroad. In the past month, whether it is railway stations, airports, or wharves, there are piles of luggage and people are like the sea everywhere. However, the sinking of the Jiangya ship into the seabed and the frequent news of plane crashes have given the refugees a head start, forcing the refugees to calm down. It turns out that fleeing is not a perfect solution. As the saying goes, "I can go, and the enemy can go," the world is vast, and it is all the same everywhere. What's more, how to maintain a livelihood is a serious problem if you are displaced in a foreign country for a long time and the cost of living is expensive. Therefore, people of insight from all walks of life in Shanghai, based on their compassion, launched the self-salvation and national salvation movement and announced to the 5 million people of the city that the way to save themselves is not to "escape," but to "self-defense." The Shanghai Self-Salvation and National Salvation Joint Association was established in this sense.

In the midst of war and chaos, to protect the lives and property of the 5 million citizens of Shanghai and to protect the freedom and culture of our Chinese people, it is impossible to achieve anything by merely talking about self-defense. Now that the Self-Salvation and National Salvation Joint Association has been established, it should actively carry out work and take planned and powerful actions. Everyone knows that "nothing can be done without money" in starting any business. Especially for self-defense work, raising a "huge sum" is required to form a self-defense corps. Even before the establishment of the self-defense corps, strengthening the training of the police and improving their treatment, so that they can better fulfill their duties to protect Shanghai, also requires a considerable amount of money. Therefore, in terms of practical needs, this small amount of 300 million Gold Yuan is absolutely insufficient for distribution. What's more, the method of raising special self-defense donations will not be implemented until January next year, and the currency value is uncertain and the prices are turbulent. In the future, 300 million will definitely not be enough for actual needs. It is better to prepare for it today than to dig a well when you are thirsty in the future.

Furthermore, taking these three fund-raising methods themselves as an example, they are reasonable in principle and there is nothing to criticize. However, the people of Shanghai should rise up to jointly defend Shanghai. The 5 million citizens should first have the spirit of sharing weal and woe and working together. Only by "those who have money contribute money and those who have strength contribute strength" can the current crisis be turned into safety. Therefore, young and strong citizens must rise up to join the self-defense corps and directly assume the task of defending Shanghai, while the wealthy should generously donate money and strive to donate. It must be known that self-defense is their own business. "When the nest is overturned, there are no intact eggs." It is better to contribute a part of your property to the local area today and obtain the guarantee of your own life and property than to lose your family property in the future. As Mr. Du Yuesheng, the president of the local association, said: "In the past, fundraising was to save others, but this time, raising donations is to save ourselves!" Therefore, raising special self-defense donations should not be aimed at the general public, but should be borne more economic responsibility by the wealthy class. This time, the three measures inevitably have a sense of imperfection. We hope that the wealthy citizens of Shanghai can automatically donate huge sums of money to be used as self-defense expenses, in order to invigorate the hearts of the people of Shanghai and make up for the shortcomings of these three measures.

In short, defending Shanghai is the business of the 5 million citizens of the city. The first step of work is now underway - raising self-defense expenses. Whether or not it can immediately achieve satisfactory results is not only related to the future of Shanghai's self-defense work, but also the touchstone of whether the citizens of Shanghai are truly aware and whether they can truly save themselves and the country!

### Peking University Faces Another Disaster; Hu Shih Acknowledges Himself as a "Deserter"; Delivers a Painful Speech at the Alumni Anniversary Meeting in Beijing

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] President Hu Shih attended the 50th anniversary of Peking University organized by the Peking University Alumni Association in Nanjing at 3:00 pm on the 17th and delivered a painful speech. The celebration was held in the auditorium of the Academia Sinica. More than 200 alumni attended. The portrait of Cai Yuanpei was hung on the front of the auditorium. The layout was simple. Mr. Hu gave a speech first. In Mr. Hu's report, he repeatedly stated that he was like a deserter and could not share the difficulties with the disaster-stricken school. Mr. Hu also praised the spirit of former Peking University President Jiang Menglin when he took over Peking University in the 20th year of the Republic of China, who reformed the old in the midst of disasters, and his greatness in supporting the situation after the September 18th Incident. Now he is facing another disaster, and he himself is like a deserter, and he called himself "a deserter without honor." Tears fell down, and the participants almost cried in unison. Then Jiang Menglin gave a speech. Mr. Jiang gave a brief speech with a sincere and humble attitude, and did not make any speculation. When talking about the future, he called it with the five words "everything is self-evident." Mr. Jiang's voice was heavy. Then Fu Sinian gave a speech. He believed that the 50-year history of Peking University created a new spirit of liberalism as its foundation. He believed that although it had not received the support of the current government in the past, communism would be even more destructive to liberalism if it made any achievements in the future. However, Mr. Fu firmly believed that the Communist Party would not last long, and after the Communist Party, there would be a great "dynasty" that could develop the seeds of liberalism that we have cultivated for 50 years. Mr. Fu claimed to be pessimistic, but he actually spoke optimistically, which made most people laugh through their tears. Then Zhu Jiahua and Di Ying gave speeches, and then went to the next room to drink good wine. According to the alumni association's report, a total of 100 kilograms of good wine were prepared. They only wanted to drink wildly and did not want to leave any leftovers. Also, the 17th was not only the anniversary of the school, but also President Hu's birthday. The intention of the alumni drinking today was one for the anniversary of the school, one for Fu Sinian's optimism, and one for President Hu's birthday. For a while, the cups were crossed and they were extremely happy, and they dispersed at six o'clock.

[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 16th] After four days of discussions, the Dutch government formally announced today its rejection of the Indonesian Republic Prime Minister Hatta's proposal to resume bilateral negotiations. According to the communique, Hatta's letter to American member Cochran of the Mediation Committee only expressed his personal opinion. If Hatta declares in a concrete manner that his government is prepared to join the federal government with other states in accordance with the conditions set by the Netherlands and these states, and proves that the Republican government is trying to stop violations of the truce agreement and the infiltration of Republican elements into Dutch territory, then a basis for reopening negotiations may be found. The Republic must make the above statement before negotiations can resume.

Suspect May Be Arrested

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] Judging from the discussions and negotiations on the budget proposal in the Japanese House of Representatives over the past two days, it is still difficult to expect the budget proposal to pass today or tomorrow.

### Hoffmann's Q&A Record (Above text continues from page one)

(Q) Does this discussion include industrial assistance and relief plans?

(A) We are currently moving forward with several industrial construction plans. Before we further understand the situation in China, I do not believe that we will support long-term plans.

(Q) What kind of Stettinius plans have been cancelled due to the recent communist victory?

(By John Leighton Stuart) I cannot remember exactly the number of industrial restoration and replenishment plans that apply to North China, north of the Yangtze River, south of the Yangtze River, or Taiwan. I believe you think we will wait and see at this moment. In the most unstable areas, except for completing the preliminary engineering inspections that are nearing completion, specific plans will not be implemented.

(Q) If the situation in China next spring is still similar to the present, that is, the Kuomintang still maintains the status quo in a weaker situation, will you propose a larger one or two-year US aid plan?

(A) The first thing we must face is the issue of appropriations for the second quarter of 1949, because the current appropriation period lasts until April 3 next year. I must agree that the appropriations are insufficient to continue the work of the ECA at this stage, and I must wait.

(Q) Please discuss the possibility of a coalition government and the conditions that the ECA will require. Will these conditions be listed in a clear contract and signed by the new government? Will this clear contract include guarantees of people's freedom and the need for the ECA to continue its work? Will the new government be asked to draft this clear contract?

(A) Our food program is being launched in six major cities, so we can talk clearly about the six major cities. If any city is transferred from the rule of the National Government to the rule of the coalition government, it may be difficult for the coalition government to become a legitimate government in the true sense, so we will never sign a formal contract with it. What we will do is only declare in a memorandum the conditions under which we may continue to provide assistance, and these conditions are the same as the current conditions.

(Q) If a National Party coalition government appears, will the same conditions be required?

(A) If the coalition government is a legitimate successor to the current government, I believe it will assume all the responsibilities of the current government, so there is no need for a new contract. If it is a so-called illegal coalition government, we will negotiate with the local governments based on special circumstances.

(Q) From the reports you have received, what do you think is the possibility of a coalition government? Do you think it is possible?

(A) The work of the ECA is limited to the economy. It would be great if Ambassador Stuart is willing to answer your political questions. No military personnel are present today, and we cannot answer military questions.

(Q) What will the ambassador say?

(A) Nothing.

(Q) Will the shipping routes be changed due to the military situation or industrial reasons? As far as I know, seven ships will arrive in Tianjin in the coming weeks.

(A) My answer can be divided into the following two points: (1) No ships are currently transporting any materials or raw materials for the industrial plan to China, and the industrial plan is still being formulated. (2) We do not intend to change the routes of ships carrying food or raw materials at this time.

(Q) In case Shanghai or Nanjing falls, do you plan to move the ECA branch elsewhere?

(John Leighton Stuart replied) This is a time that requires close attention, and we have not made any definite plans.

(Q) It is now believed that the ECA personnel in China have exercised work that we believe is beyond the scope of the agency's authority, such as the measures they took and the assistance they provided in transporting coal during the Shanghai famine at the end of November. Your views are all excellent. Are you willing to comment?

(A) When I appointed John Leighton Stuart as the first director of the ECA branch, I knew that he would sometimes take unusual measures to fulfill the agency's purpose of helping the people of these cities.

### Representatives of Universities and Colleges Return to Shanghai After Appealing Regarding the Price of Newsprint

[Our Report] Wang Yukai, the president of Guangxia Commercial College, who was dispatched by private universities and colleges in the city to appeal to the Ministry of Education in Nanjing regarding the price of newsprint foreign exchange quotas, returned to Shanghai yesterday. The Ministry of Education has decided to send Xu Weizhu, an assistant from the General Affairs Department, to Shanghai to negotiate with the Central Bank. In October of this year, the Ministry of Education instructed all universities and colleges that the required newsprint had been arranged with the Import Control Committee, with foreign exchange quotas set according to the number of students in each school. At that time, four gold yuan equaled one U.S. dollar. Later, the government adjusted the exchange rate to 20 gold yuan per U.S. dollar, and now the exchange requires 48 yuan. The presidents of the various schools believe that if they settle the accounts at this rate, the price of the newsprint will be more expensive than the current market price. The schools paid the money to Defeng Foreign Firm in early November to handle the matter, and it is now impossible to get a refund. They must settle the accounts at the price of 48 yuan, which is unreasonable, hence the dispatch of a representative to Nanjing to appeal to the Ministry of Education.

A wicker basket containing two taels of pure gold, 2,000 yuan in cash, and other clothing and items had also been stolen. She couldn't help but feel sadness from within and burst into tears.

### Second Inspection of Jiangya Ship; Two Judges Return Late at Night; Divers Report Explosion Seemed to Originate from Inside

[Our Report] The District Prosecutor's Office has assigned prosecutors Cao Hong and Yu Bingquan to investigate the responsibility for the Jiangya ship disaster. Prosecutors Cao and Yu took the China Merchants Bureau's Jianlun ship to the accident site off Wusongkou on the morning of the 14th, but returned without results due to strong winds and waves. Yesterday, they went to inspect the site again. Those who accompanied them were lawyers Yu Shun, Zheng Lin, Tong Xia, Gongkai, Wang Peiji from the Ningbo Association legal group, Zhou Qifan from the Salvage Group, Zhang Jinde, Chief Engineer of the China Merchants Bureau, Fan Lun, Head of the Maritime Affairs Section, Hu Jiaxin, Business Director, lawyer Tong Jingkui from the Shaoxing Association legal group, Cao Liangqing, representative of the Supervisory Committee of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, representatives from the Marine Engineer and Driving Association, and a group of reporters from various newspapers, totaling more than 30 people. They departed on the Jianlun ship at 8:10 a.m. and arrived at the Jiangya ship accident site at around 12:00 noon. Divers went underwater to search the sunken ship. According to the divers, the bottom of the ship was intact, and the explosion occurred at the stern, appearing to have originated from inside the ship. The prosecutors also went aboard the deck of the Jiangya ship above the sea to inspect the ground. They also retrieved two pieces of exploded iron from the ship in the water as a reference for the investigation. The inspection was completed at around 4:00 p.m. The group returned to the China Merchants Bureau dock at around 9:00 p.m. yesterday evening.

No Bodies Recovered for Two Days; Turns Out Divers Are on Strike

[Our Report] The body recovery work for the Jiangya ship disaster was originally undertaken by 150 divers jointly hired by the China Merchants Bureau and the Disaster Relief Committee, with generous compensation. However, the recovery work was inevitably slower due to the high tide, and therefore it was criticized by various parties. A few days ago, all the divers suddenly stated that they had heard on Shanghai Radio's Xiaokuaile broadcast that they were being watched too closely, making it impossible for them to get any "extra income," and therefore they were deliberately slowing down. They considered this to be intentional humiliation and stopped the recovery work, demanding that the China Merchants Bureau and the Relief Committee negotiate with the broadcaster. As a result, no sunken bodies were brought to Shanghai on the 15th and 16th.

Voluntarily Resumed Work Yesterday; 43 Bodies Transported

After the news spread, the families of the victims in the city were extremely anxious and urged the Relief Committee to send personnel to persuade them to resume work, fearing that if the recovery work was delayed any longer, the bodies at the bottom of the ship would rot. At the same time, the China Merchants Bureau also made efforts to persuade them, explaining the moral responsibilities that the divers should have. All the divers were deeply moved and voluntarily resumed work yesterday morning. As a result of the day's recovery efforts, the China Merchants Bureau recovered nine bodies, and the Relief Committee's recovery team recovered eleven bodies. In addition, sailing boats recovered 23 floating bodies along the coast, for a total of 43 bodies. By night, all of them had been transported to Shanghai, unloaded at Pier 3, and then sent by car to the Siming Guild Hall for identification.

The rice that has been eaten in the school in recent days has been purchased with funds advanced by the school, which can temporarily last until the 20th.

### Ample Supply, Stagnant Sales; Rice Prices Fall Without Ceasing; Flour and Grains Decline, Only Vegetable Oil Sees a Slight Increase

The rice market is declining daily, continuing to fall. Due to the ample supply and stagnant sales, supply exceeds demand. Although there is some buying at low prices, the market is still flooded with goods. White japonica and thin rice in the Nanshi market have both fallen by 15 yuan, each retreating to 320 yuan. High-quality early rice has retreated to the 300 yuan level, and medium-quality and substandard goods have fallen below 300 yuan. Yangdu indica has decreased by 10 yuan. The market closed with slightly higher prices for all goods. In the Beishi market, japonica and thin rice both fell by 5 to 10 yuan. Total arrivals in the two markets were 9,894 piculs.

Flour

Decreased across the board. Morale is low, and small retail investors are taking a wait-and-see approach. There are still many who are trying to sell off their holdings. Sales are higher than purchases. Lao Che flour closed at 134 yuan, a decrease of 8 yuan. Bingchuan flour opened at 130 yuan and closed at 127 yuan, a decrease of 3 yuan. Hongfeng decreased by 8 yuan. Miscellaneous brands of flour opened steadily but later decreased by 5 to 6 yuan. Skin flour decreased by 3 to 4 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

Slightly fluctuating. There are still few out-of-town buyers, and trading is still sparse. Soybeans fell by 5 to 10 yuan, corn fell by 5 yuan, red sorghum also fell by 5 yuan, tea beans sales are sluggish, sesame is high but second-rate, raw peanuts sales are weak and slightly decreased by 10 to 20 yuan.

Edible Oil

Weak and sluggish. Only vegetable oil saw a slight increase in price due to the export of foreign packaged products. Vegetable oil closed at 870 yuan, an increase of 30 yuan. Soybean oil supply is abundant, falling by 20 yuan and closing at 910 yuan. Jixiang barrel vegetable oil decreased by 50 yuan, and small cart sesame oil also decreased by 50 yuan. Soybean cake has no sales and fell by 6 yuan.

### Bank Deposits Increase

[Our Report] In the past month, due to the current situation, prices have been relatively stable, and the deposit business of commercial banks has improved. The total amount of deposits in the city in November was approximately 200 million gold yuan, which is a significant increase compared to before the currency change. However, most of the deposits are demand deposits.

### Emergency Industrial Loan Cases to be Reviewed at Any Time

[Our Report] After the emergency industrial loans were launched, various manufacturers have successively filled out application forms, which have been forwarded to the Subsidy Committee by various banks. A total of more than 30 cases will be reviewed by the review committee at any time. Thirteen cases of finished product purchases were approved at the meeting on the 16th and will be submitted to the Subsidy Committee for final decision next Monday.

### Foreign Exchange Certificates Slightly Recover

Foreign exchange transfer certificates weakened in the city yesterday. They opened at 55.5 yuan in the morning. Buyers saw the low price and absorbed slightly, rising to 57.5 yuan. Sellers at that time wanted to sell off, and then they fell back, closing at 55 yuan. The remittance exchange rate yesterday was still 56 yuan.

[Our Report] Since the promulgation of the Measures for Applying for the Import of Production Equipment and Raw Materials with Overseas Chinese Remittances, no one has been interested for several weeks due to the war situation. Only one application was received last week. According to general observations, it is unlikely that overseas Chinese will invest in the country before the overall situation stabilizes.

### Sugar Market Recovers

The sugar market was relatively stable yesterday. Local buyers slightly increased their purchases, and Hangzhou buyers also added to their holdings. Supply and sales in the market were also strong, and the asking price saw a slight increase. No. 45 Che White Refined Sugar closed at 465 yuan, a slight increase of 10 yuan. Granulated sugar and medium sugar each increased by 5 to 10 yuan. Xinghua red and Hainan red had weak buying interest. People are tired of watching, and the price saw a slight decline. The remaining supply and demand were balanced, and the trend was still strong, with a slight increase.

### Lively Trends in the Tea Market

Regarding exported boxed tea, since the foreign exchange transfer certificates reached their peak, exporters have had remarkably smooth intake. As for domestic sales of various types, places like this street have also seen gathered purchasing power, with a trend towards activity, as money seems to be tight yet loose. Transactions could have proceeded smoothly, but because merchants believe costs are still difficult to suppress and that market inventory is low, they generally adopt a firm-selling attitude, resulting in only a few deals being made. In terms of price, it is exceptionally impressive, and the foundation can be considered optimistic. According to general observations, there is much hope.

### Explanation of Handling Procedures for Goods Import Applications by the Import Management Office

Recently, the person in charge of the non-quota import department of the Import and Export Control Commission stated that regarding the Category A goods import applications approved and issued approval notices before September 30 of this year, and the Category C goods import applications that have been approved but have not yet been issued approval notices, there may be a lack of clarity from the outside world regarding how these matters will be handled. Therefore, a special explanation is provided below:

(1) For applications with approval notices issued before September 30, the government's emergency financial and economic measures and related decrees issued due to the implementation of currency system reforms did not explicitly state whether foreign exchange for Category A in Annexes (1) and (3) would be supplied as usual. The Executive Yuan was consulted for instructions. Subsequently, an order was received from the Yuan approving the usual supply. However, due to limited foreign exchange quotas, it was insufficient to issue the accumulated approval applications from the past. Contact was made with the National Bank to allocate additional foreign exchange for distribution. Because this process took time, after reaching an agreement, issuance began in November according to priority procedures and application order, and it is still ongoing.

(2) The issuance procedures stipulated by the department prioritize handling special cases for public utilities and those with time sensitivity and news value. Other ordinary applications are processed according to the application order mentioned above.

(3) Currently, the foreign exchange quota allocated to the department is only US$1.3 million per month, with US$650,000 for Annex (1) and US$650,000 for Annex (3) Category A.

(4) Applications submitted after October 1 are also reviewed according to the standards stipulated by the department without interruption, and issuance is still in progress according to the order.

### Tung Oil Firmly Navigating

From morning to closing yesterday in the tung oil market, although some industry peers still sold off at the high prices, there were still many who hoarded goods and bid up the prices. At the same time, the well-stocked white oil, mainly for export, was continuously absorbed by exporters in a hurry to meet shipping schedules. The process ultimately navigated firmly, rising to 8,500 yuan per dan, a slight increase of 30 yuan compared to before. As for Hongjiang tung oil, the footing was extremely stable, with no signs of imminent danger.

### Stagnant Sales by Local Merchants, Narrow Fluctuations in the Yarn Market, Slight Fall in Cotton Cloth Prices with Small Ups and Downs

The yarn market presented a hovering situation, with very narrow fluctuations. Actual sales by local merchants were stagnant, and the trend was quite mediocre. As a result, most yarns showed a state of decline.

42-count Blue Phoenix was bid up from 16,000 yuan to 16,600 yuan in the Hankou market, ultimately holding steady at 100 yuan. Other yarns such as Jincheng Tiannv showed mixed trends. 40-count Blue Phoenix closed at 14,400 yuan, squeezing up 200 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon opened at a low of 13,500 yuan and then stepped up briskly to close at 14,200 yuan, down 300 yuan from the previous day. Blue Phoenix also fell by 200 yuan.

21-count Double Horse spot goods initially traded at 13,300 yuan and ultimately reached 14,000 yuan, squeezing up 300 yuan. 20-count Double Horse fell by 200 yuan. Other yarns such as Golden Rooster and Tiannv all showed softening, and the trend for coarse yarns such as 16-count and 10-count was also sluggish.

The cotton cloth market opened in a weak state in the morning, and morale was low. There was a chorus of selling from all sides. However, near noon, as Guangdong and Hankou merchants made purchases on dips, market prices began to rebound. As a result, most prices were unchanged from the previous day.

Longtou fine cloth initially opened at 470 yuan. As the supply was very strong, asking prices became increasingly loose. However, after falling to a low of 445 yuan, it stepped up and held firm, once approaching the 500 yuan mark. It closed at 490 yuan, leveling with the previous day. Wufu fine cloth was slightly better by 5 yuan.

Sijunzi Yuan Piji stepped up from 450 yuan to close at 490 yuan, squeezing down 5 yuan. Jinlian Miaowu Yuan Piji fell 10 yuan to close at 460 yuan. Sijunzi Yuan Zhigong was at 505 yuan, ultimately falling 1 yuan. Tiaoli Yuan Guangxie opened at 290 yuan. There was little remaining in the market, and most prices were unchanged.

### Continued Weakness in Raw Silk and Silk Fabrics, Rayon Enters a Consolidating Phase

The rayon market was quiet yesterday, and transactions were not active. Merchants in this street had very little appetite, and sellers' desire to sell was also lax. The market was mediocre, with extremely small fluctuations. The market closed slightly up by 300 yuan.

No. 12 Tianqiao opened at 13,000 yuan in the morning. In the middle, the market atmosphere hovered, and the trend was stable. The small gains were not significant, and there was a lack of strength to rise. As a result, there was a slight increase of 300 yuan. Other grades were flat.

Foreign exchange transfer certificates for raw silk have seen a slight rebound, and sellers' desire to sell has slightly loosened. For export goods, foreign firms purchasing CD grade still had a smooth intake, and transactions continued. Domestic sales were high first and then soft, and the market presented a hovering trend. D grade 7/8 evenness opened at 15,000 yuan in the morning. In the middle of the day, due to smooth sales, morale improved, and asking prices rose by 500 yuan. Near noon, due to a drop in foreign exchange rates, morale slightly softened, and the trend turned weak. Asking prices fell back again, and the market closed at 15,000 yuan, down 2,000 yuan from the previous day's noon closing. Other grades were soft. In the afternoon, as the rumors dissipated, morale slightly stabilized, and the market slightly improved by 1,100 to 1,500 yuan.

The silk fabric market continued to be weak yesterday, with quiet customer sales. Merchants in this street had saturated intake, and factories were still selling smoothly due to money matters. Market prices fell. Meiya Huaqiang opened at 9,500 yuan and 9,300 yuan in the morning. The process in the middle became weak, and merchants' intake intentions were unmoved. Market prices fell sharply across the board. There was still no improvement at the close. Meiya closed at 9,100 yuan, and Huaqiang closed at 9,000 yuan, squeezing down 800 yuan. Dacheng Bizhou, Dawei Ni, and others also saw squeezed down prices.

Raw Silk Exports May Face a Crisis

Currently, various foreign firms in this city are buying heavily for resale abroad because the overseas silk market has turned brisk. However, prices have not seen a significant rise because they are affected by the price limits in the US market. According to silk industry sources, the price limits announced by the United States in 1948 will expire at the end of this month. There is hope that these limits may be adjusted in the US market, so the future trend of raw silk abroad may be optimistic.

Spot Cotton Continues to Soften

The spot cotton market was still small yesterday. Domestic companies were still selling actively, and yarn factories still had intentions to purchase. The market was mediocre, but most of the transactions were for swapping cotton yarn. Zhengzhou was trading at 1,600 yuan, Hankou fine velvet at 1,420 yuan, Shashi at 1,560 yuan, Huoji at 1,150 yuan, and Zhoupu seed cotton at 260 yuan to 265 yuan.

### No One is Buying Export Goods, Export Trade Volume Plummets

According to sources in the import and export industry, this is the time when new goods of export commodities such as bristles, tung oil, and casings are on the market, and it is also the peak season for exporters to purchase these export commodities. In previous years, exporters sent personnel to various producing areas to expand purchases. However, this year's purchasing situation is the opposite. There are hardly any exporters purchasing these export commodities. There are three reasons for this:

(1) Due to the war, some producing areas have been reduced to war zones, and it is no longer possible to send personnel to purchase.

(2) Relatively safe producing areas are only Chongqing, Wanxian, and other areas, but after the purchase, there is no transportation to Shanghai. Many ships have been requisitioned for military transport, and military transport is busier than passenger transport, leaving no time to take care of cargo transport.

(3) After being transported to Shanghai, if it is difficult to sell temporarily, there are concerns about their safety. Due to the lack of purchases of export goods, the current export trade has plummeted. In previous years, many foreign firms came to Shanghai to place orders at this time. Currently, foreign firms have stopped coming to Shanghai to place orders because they cannot obtain goods. The prospects for export trade have suffered another blow.
