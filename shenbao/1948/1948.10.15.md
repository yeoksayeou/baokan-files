(3) The National Army that launched an offensive from Changchun is still operating in the vicinity. There is no truth to the rumor that the authorities have ordered a retreat.

[Another Dispatch] The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense released the following article on the 14th: "Review of Recent Battle Situation":

A. Bandit Conspiracy and National Army's Bandit Suppression Strategy

The bandits launched their so-called autumn offensive last month, with central Shandong and western Liaoning as the main battlefields, and Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan as supporting battlefields, attempting to sever the connection between our Northeast and North China, and to disrupt the communication between our important strategic bases in North China and Central China. They also sought to connect the bandit forces in the Northeast, North China, Northwest, and Central China. They first attacked Jinan, then raided western Liaoning, damaged the Beining and PingSui railways, threatened GuiSui, Zhangyuan, Datong, and Taiyuan, and roamed Guanzhong, attempting to damage the Longhai and PingHan-Jinpu southern section railways. They implemented a siege battle and propagated that after military success, they would convene the so-called New Political Consultative Conference to prepare for the establishment of a puppet government to expand their rebellion conspiracy.

In order to crush the bandits' conspiracy and annihilate the main force of the bandit army, the National Army gradually adopted active offensives on various battlefields, concentrating its forces. On one hand, it severely struck the bandit troops of Lin Biao and Chen Yi in the main battlefield, and on the other hand, it dealt a head-on blow to the bandit troops of Nie Rongzhen, He Long, Xu Xiangqian, Peng Dehuai, Liu Bocheng, and Chen Geng in the supporting battlefields. The powerful offensives launched by the National Army stationed in Northeast Changfan changed the situation in the northern and western Liaoning battlefields. The counter-offensive of the National Army in Chahar-Suiyuan and Shanxi-Shaanxi made the bandits exhausted and suffered heavy losses. In particular, the great victory in eastern Shaanxi caused Peng Dehuai's bandit troops, who had been rearming and replenishing for half a year, to almost repeat the Donglong debacle, with one-third of them being routed and annihilated. As for the two bandit troops of Chen and Liu in Central and East China, although they concentrated their forces and prepared for defensive offensives, the National Army is steadily advancing towards the bandits. The National Army has fully gained the initiative on various battlefields, while the bandits' forces are scattered and gradually falling into a passive position. At present, the National Army's strategy for suppressing bandits is to consolidate Central China, ensure the transportation between the Northeast and North China, concentrate forces, seek a decisive battle with the main force of the bandits, and not focus on the gains and losses of one city or town. Looking at the situation on various battlefields, in the autumn operations, the National Army has clearly and gradually gained the advantageous position of shifting from defense to offense and from defeat to victory.

B. Situation on Various Battlefields

(1) Northeast Battlefield: In the past week, the National Army has taken strong new actions. The garrison of Changchun is launching offensives outwards, and the bandit troops are retreating one after another. Our airdropped food and ammunition are no longer obstructed by bandit artillery fire. Our powerful corps in PanYang launched a large-scale westward offensive, and on the afternoon of the 11th, recovered Zhangwu. The bandit 5th Column and Mongolian bandits suffered casualties and fled. Fierce fighting continued southwest of Zhangwu for days. Another National Army force captured Raoyang River southwest of Xinmin on the morning of the 12th and is currently advancing towards Xinlitun Dahu Mountain. Our powerful corps advancing north from Huludao also began attacking the bandits on the 10th and entered Tasha Mountain northeast of Jinxi on the morning of the 12th. The 11th and 12th divisions of the bandit 4th Column retreated eastward. Seeing the rapid progress of our armies on all fronts, the bandits concentrated their forces to intensify their invasion of Jinzhou. The battle once approached the suburbs. The Jinzhou garrison launched a fierce counter-offensive against the invading bandits with close air artillery coordination on the evening of the 11th, and recovered Beidaying in the early hours of the 12th. The bandit 8th Column retreated eastward. Another unit attacking south of Jinzhou once captured Liujiatun on the morning of the 12th. The bandits sent reinforcements to counterattack, and fierce fighting is still underway. As for the bandits on the northwest sides, after a fierce offensive by the National Army, one division of the bandit's Third Column was annihilated. Our regimental commanders suffered casualties of one each. The bandits have now retreated from Liangma Mountain and Shiqiaozi (north of Jinzhou). The National Army on this front is launching an advantageous counter-offensive. The decisive battle in the two Jinzhens has been going on for several days, and the outcome will be decided soon.

(2) North China Battlefield: Because the bandit Nie's activities in southern Suiyuan and southern Chahar were suppressed by our army, the battle has gradually shifted eastward this week. The main force of the bandit 3rd and 4th Columns, part of the 2nd Column, and the bandit units such as the Independent 7th Division, Independent 8th Division, and Independent 1st Brigade, are roaming around Kangzhuang and Juyongguan inside and outside the Great Wall. After the Changping National Army launched an offensive to the periphery on the 7th, after four days of repeated fierce fighting, it finally repelled the invading bandits on the morning of the 12th. Another group of bandits attacking the Xinbaoan Railway Station was also dealt a head-on blow by our army and fled north on the morning of the 12th. Part of the 4th Column retreated southwest.

The war in Taiyuan has also become more intense this week. There have been fierce battles for Xinying, Gaozhong and other villages around the Wusu Airport 30 li south of the city, Shizuizi about 20 li southeast to north of the city, and Fenggeliang and other places 30 li northeast of the city west of the city. Since noon on the 11th, the bandit 22nd and 39th Brigades have continued to attack Xinying, Gaozhong and other villages, as well as the blockhouses in the southwest corner of Wusu, but they were all bravely repelled by our army. Some bandits who broke into Wusu Village were completely annihilated by the National Army. The battles in the above locations are still ongoing.

(3) Northwest Battlefield: Since Peng Dehuai's bandit troops suffered a disastrous defeat in the Jingwei River valley, they fled to the Huanglong Mountain area to rest and reorganize. Recently, with the help of the bandit army in southern Shanxi, they have gathered their four columns of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns to invade south again. After the National Army lured the bandits away from the Huanglong Mountain area this time, because the pre-arranged deployment was strict, after the bandits fled to Pingmin, Chaoyi, and Dali (all southeast of Heyang Chengcheng), a full-scale offensive was launched immediately. The bandits attacking Dali have been severely wiped out by our army in Dahaoying, East and West Han Villages, Yanzhi Mountain and other places since the 11th. By noon on the 13th, nearly one-third of the bandit 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns were killed or wounded, and they fled north in a panic. More than 7,000 bodies were left near Dahaoying and Han Village. Our pursuing troops have reached the line east and west of Shuangquan Town and are intensifying their pursuit and suppression of the fleeing bandits. Peng's bandit troops, who had been reorganized and replenished for half a year, have once again suffered a disastrous blow from us.

(4) Other Areas in Western Henan and Northern Hubei: The bandit troops of Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng are still lingering on the west side of the PingHan Railway and dare not act rashly. The National Army is launching a sweeping battle in the southwest area of the PingHan Railway, and the air force is also conducting constant reconnaissance and bombing in the area. As for southwest Shandong, as the National Army continues to press north, Chen Yi's bandit troops are successively transferring south, concentrating their forces in Jining, Yanzhou, and southern Shandong, attempting to resist stubbornly. There have been no major battles in this area in recent weeks.

Editorial

### The Allocation Problem of Production Materials

Generally speaking, people are now paying attention to how to increase production and how to maintain production. This is progress! Because it is very dangerous to only know about price limits and forget about production. To produce, one cannot be without raw materials, so everyone is paying attention to the source of raw materials, but few people pay attention to the allocation problem of raw materials. The Shanghai District Materials Adjustment Committee recently resolved that, except for the allocation of cotton, fuel, and imported raw materials, which are managed by specialized agencies, the allocation methods for the remaining raw materials without allocation agencies will be formulated by the Industrial Association and submitted to the Supervisory Office for approval and implementation. According to this speculation, the future distribution channels of raw materials will be no more than the following two: (1) Specialized material management agencies, such as the China Trust Bureau; (2) Industrial associations or their respective industry associations. In the past, the distribution of materials was generally handled through the above channels, and in the future, it will follow the old regulations, which will not be difficult to achieve the effect of being familiar with the road. However, the scope of intra-industry distribution is often limited to the same industry (that is, members participating in the association), and the distribution of materials by specialized management agencies is often conditional on whether they are members or have obtained a license or registration certificate. Those that are stricter must also determine the grade according to the size of their scale. As a result, the following three types of factories often do not have the right to be allocated: (1) small factories, (2) handicrafts; (3) new businesses that are not allowed to join the association. According to current laws, regardless of whether it is commerce or industry, there are mandatory provisions for joining associations. Strictly speaking, there are no businesses outside the association, and all businesses are of course members. However, the new Industrial Association Law is more restrictive, and there is a category of smaller factories that are not allowed to join the association due to the lack of power equipment or the number of workers employed not meeting the statutory number. Also, due to the implementation of rationing, there are indeed a small number of associations that deliberately set up prohibitions or create various difficulties, making it impossible for newly established factories to obtain the qualifications of members. The most prominent of the small factories that hold back are yarn factories with less than 3,000 spindles. There are also various production cooperatives that do not join industry associations due to their different organizations, and of course, they cannot participate in the distribution; this is even more contrary to the economic policy of the Three People's Principles of the government advocating cooperative enterprises.

The above-mentioned categories of industries have a relatively small scope and weak productivity. From the perspective of increasing production alone, their relationship is relatively minor. However, there are many units, and the total number is still considerable. Moreover, due to the poor equipment, the number of people they employ is relatively higher than that of large factories, so from the point of view of maintaining employment, its seriousness cannot be ignored. In order to avoid unemployment and encourage production, we hope that these small-scale industries will be taken care of when allocating raw materials, so that they can share the benefits equally, so as not to affect the entire social economy.

The promotion of cooperatives was originally a fixed national policy, and it should have priority in the allocation of materials according to law; small factories that have joined the association and newly established factories that have started operations are both production enterprises, and there is no reason to discriminate against them. The problem lies in the factories that do not meet the statutory conditions and the handicrafts that are not yet organized. We must find ways to unite them separately so as to undertake this distribution work. Because the group is the link between the top and the bottom, all application, acceptance, and distribution tasks must be handled by this link. If it is too scattered, as it is now, even if the material agencies treat everyone equally and intend to help, they will feel helpless, let alone group purchases and solve the raw material problem themselves.

Handicrafts are general factories or home industries. If there is no suitable statutory organization to organize, it is best to guide them to organize production cooperatives so as to make it easier to gather things together. As for small factories that do not meet the statutory conditions, if they are not allowed to join the industrial association, they should find other ways to allow them to unite and help each other to make up for it. In our opinion, the source and allocation of raw materials are equally important. If some production organizations are in a state of stagnation because they cannot obtain the allocated raw materials, then even if the raw materials have a source, the problem is still not completely solved.

### Zhang Lisheng Sticks to the Defense Line and Will Not Consider Negotiated Prices; He Said That There Is Only One Way to Eliminate the Black Market, and There Will Be No End to Negotiations

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] Zhang Lisheng said today on the issue of negotiated prices: The government will never consider the term "negotiated prices." The so-called negotiation is like seeking skin from a tiger, and there will be no end to the negotiation. For goods purchased after August 19, if merchants provide valid reasons, the government should approve them according to their costs when necessary, rather than negotiate. Also, prices should not be negotiated because there is a black market. There is only one way to eliminate the black market, which is to crack down on it. This is my core belief, and I will work hard to implement it accordingly. Success should be expected. If it is not successful, everyone should be responsible, and the people should all have this belief. Zhang believes that the universal distribution of daily necessities is a good way to curb prices.

[Another Dispatch] Zhang Lisheng convened all representatives of Hebei and Ping municipal leaders and relevant agencies at 3 pm today to discuss the issue of prices and materials. It was decided that the prices of oil, matches, cloth, salt, and grain must not exceed the limited prices and must be strictly rationed and sold.

### Supervisory Commissioner Hao Yulin Writes to Zhang Lisheng, Criticizing the Reasonableness of Price Limits

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 14th] Hao Yulin, the Supervisory Commissioner of the Supervision Committee of the Hebei-Rehe-Chahar Supervisory Commissioner's Office, recently wrote to Zhang Lisheng, criticizing the price limit policy. The letter was more than 2,000 words long, stating that the prices were secretly rising and increasing, making people turn pale at the mention of them. The price limits on August 19 were far against the natural trend, so they produced all kinds of black markets, whose prices exceeded the price limits by three, four, or even ten times, but buyers rushed to buy them. The malpractices caused by rigid price limits are beyond the imagination of the authorities: (1) materials are even more scarce, (2) materials are easily flowing into bandit areas, (3) poor households suffer even more, (4) restricting bank interest rates and making floating capital abound and merchants refuse to sell. Based on the above reasons, the price limits on August 19 have reached the point where a reasonable adjustment is necessary. Before the controls, one bingchuan fenhe jinyuan was more than 7 yuan, but in recent months it has risen to 60 yuan, so it is suggested that (1) local prices do not need to be rigidly stipulated by the central government, and (2) the prices of goods used by only a few people may be increased as much as possible during negotiations.

### Hopes Dashed for Extra-Council Compromise on Berlin Question - Security Council to Resume Debate Today - Soviet Response Fails to Satisfy the Three Powers

[United Press, Paris, 14th] The United Nations Security Council convened on the 14th to discuss the Palestine issue, but the Berlin debate remained the central focus of all problems. The Security Council plans to resume the Berlin debate on the 15th. The US representative Jessup, the British representative Cadogan, and the French representative Parodi held new talks this morning to draft a plan to condemn the Soviet Union as an aggressor and a threat to peace as soon as possible. It is reported that the three are drafting a motion to be submitted when the Security Council resumes the Berlin debate. The Soviet representative Vyshinsky will certainly veto the Western motion. If the West fails in the Security Council, it will inevitably move the court of "trial" for the Soviet Union to the General Assembly, passing the Western proposal as a recommendation. The Soviet Union has no veto power in the General Assembly and will not be able to repeat its old tricks. Vyshinsky insisted on the 13th that the Berlin crisis should be removed from the Security Council's agenda before negotiations are sought for an agreement, which the West refused. Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, who has been running around for reconciliation for the past week, spoke with Vyshinsky and the three Western representatives again on the 14th. His assistant said that Bramuglia had given up hope of avoiding a showdown vote in the Security Council, and hinted that Argentina might abstain from voting at that time. The representatives of the three Western powers will meet again tonight to plan their future actions. At the same time, the six neutral members of the Security Council also held a meeting to consider the pressure from the three powers to support a joint resolution condemning the Soviet Union. It is generally expected that Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia will open the resumed debate on the Berlin issue on the 15th, report on the mediation process, and announce his recommendations and responses to both sides.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 13th, United Press] The Soviet Union today demanded that the Berlin case be withdrawn from the Security Council as the first step towards resolving the Berlin crisis, thereby closing the door to an early resolution of the Berlin crisis. The above request was the Soviet Union's response to the compromise proposal submitted by Security Council President Bramuglia to Soviet representative Vyshinsky. According to sources close to the three powers, the Soviet response was unsatisfactory. Bramuglia convened the Security Council to meet on the 15th to resume discussion of the Berlin crisis. Bramuglia visited Vyshinsky today for an hour to gather the Soviet Union's response to the mediation efforts. Bramuglia's mediation efforts were based on the simultaneous lifting of the Berlin blockade and the convening of a four-power foreign ministers' conference to discuss the entire German issue. The three powers, which have been in constant contact regarding the Berlin negotiations, believe that the Soviet response includes the following unsatisfactory conditions: (1) The three powers will not agree to the condition of withdrawing the Berlin case from the Security Council's agenda. (2) The East and West should return to the situation as of August 30. The four powers in Moscow agreed to discuss the blockade and currency system plan together, but after the negotiations moved to Berlin, the Soviet Union ignored the above plan.

### Security Council Discusses Holy Land Issue - Listens to Bunche Report - Assassination of Mediator Bernadotte - China, Britain, and France Request Detailed Explanation from Israel

[United Press, Paris, 14th] The United Nations Security Council convened on the 14th to discuss the Palestine issue. A British spokesman said that the United States and Britain both supported the late Bernadotte's report to the United Nations, considering it the best basic solution to the Holy Land war. Attempts by the Soviet Union, Ukraine, and Syria to delay the Security Council's consideration of violations of the Holy Land ceasefire agreement by both Arabs and Jews have failed. The Security Council ultimately voted eight to zero, with three abstentions, to adopt the agenda and continue to listen to the report of Acting Mediator Bunche.

[This Newspaper News] Paris, 14th Broadcast: Acting Holy Land Mediator Bunche called on the Security Council to take action on the assassination of Bernadotte. The representatives of China, Britain, and France all supported this, proposing a resolution demanding that the Israeli government provide a complete report on the assassination and requesting that the Israeli and Arab governments grant United Nations representatives free passage and security guarantees.

[This Newspaper News] Paris, 14th Broadcast: Bunche accused the Jewish government of negligence in the assassination of Bernadotte and urged the Security Council to demand a detailed explanation from the Israeli government.

Bunche protested that he had not yet received a formal report from the Israeli government regarding the arrest of the Stern Gang.

[This Newspaper News] Paris, 14th Broadcast: United Nations Israeli representative Eban said in the Security Council that the Israeli government would do its best to determine the murderers of Bernadotte and report to the United Nations. Eban said that the Israeli government had taken strong action against the two major Jewish groups, the Stern Gang and the Irgun, and had dissolved them. Eban also stated that if United Nations observers wish to obtain free passage and appropriate protection, they should be distributed equally within Arab and Jewish territories.

The Security Council adjourned at 5:30 p.m. to allow representatives sufficient time to study the resolution proposed by Britain. The date of the next meeting has not yet been decided.

### US Does Not Intend to Recognize Holy Land Arab Government

Lovett announced at a press conference

[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] Acting Secretary of State Lovett announced at a press conference that the United States has recognized the State of Israel and therefore cannot recognize the newly established Palestine and Arab government.

[This Newspaper News] London, 14th Broadcast: The Syrian and Lebanese governments announced on the 14th that they had recognized the Arab government established in the Gaza region of Palestine.

### British and American Occupation Zones in Germany Intensify Anti-Monopoly Stores Blockade

Soviet Newspaper Telegraph Relaxes Conditions for Lifting Blockade

[This Newspaper News] London, 14th Broadcast: In order to intensify the anti-blockade against the Soviet occupation zone, the British and American governments have recently issued an order that any goods transported from the British and American occupation zones to the Soviet occupation zone without a bill of lading will be confiscated.

[United Press, Berlin, 14th] The Soviet Army newspaper "Daily Review" reiterated the Soviet Union's suggestion on the 14th that the Soviet blockade of Berlin would be lifted if the marks issued by the Western countries were withdrawn from Berlin. The newspaper also defended the Soviet Union, saying that the blockade was necessary to protect East Germany from economic conspiracies after the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany. The newspaper's editorial stated that the day the Western marks are withdrawn will be the day the traffic control is lifted.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] Yoshida Shigeru, the president of the Japan Democratic Liberal Party and former Prime Minister, received more votes than the other five candidates in the first round of voting in the House of Representatives tonight, but failed to obtain a majority. In the first round of voting, he received 184 votes, but the House of Representatives has a total of 460 seats and needs 234 votes to constitute a majority. Katayama Tetsu, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, received only 87 votes, falling far behind Yoshida Shigeru and ranking second. Communist leader Tokuda Kyuichi received 4 votes, all of which were clearly cast by the four Communist members. There were also 86 blank spoiled ballots, which were clearly due to the abstention of all Democratic Party members. Because Yoshida Shigeru failed to obtain a majority in the first round of voting, a runoff election was required between Yoshida Shigeru and Katayama Tetsu. The House of Representatives immediately continued to hold a second round of voting late tonight. As a result, Yoshida Shigeru, the extremely conservative president of the Democratic Liberal Party, was elected with 185 votes. In the runoff election between Yoshida Shigeru and Katayama Tetsu, Katayama Tetsu received only one vote out of the 399 votes cast, and the number of abstentions in the form of blank ballots was 213. The election of Yoshida Shigeru, president of the Democratic Liberal Party, as the new Japanese cabinet, actually foreshadows that the new cabinet will be a short-lived cabinet, and its fate may not last more than a month or two. Yoshida Shigeru has declared that he will dissolve the parliament and hold general elections after a few important bills are passed by the current parliamentary session. Parliamentary sources pointed out that at least laws such as the National Public Service Act, the Supplementary Budget Act, and the Wage Stabilization Act must be passed by the current parliamentary session before it is dissolved. They expect that the legislative process to complete the above bills will take about a month. The results of the first round of voting in the House of Representatives today show that Yoshida Shigeru did not receive the support of the three former government parties, which still occupy the majority of seats in the parliament.

We do not control anyone, we accept the concept of equality of religion, skin color, and status. In the areas we control, we strive for autonomy and independence. We do not seek to overthrow their political system, but we will do everything to prevent them from destroying our freedom."

### US Strengthens Aid to China

New Foreign Aid Plan to be Discussed at Next Meeting

China Could Receive $700 Million

[United Press, Washington, 14th] According to a United Press survey on the 14th, regardless of the outcome of the November elections, the next Congress will deal with a record-breaking foreign aid plan totaling over $8 billion. The plan will strengthen military aid. The Far East will receive a larger share of both economic and military aid. The countries receiving aid will be China, Japan, South Korea, Western Europe, Turkey, Austria, Greece, and Turkey. The aid planned for non-communist countries in the next fiscal year will reflect the current tense situation in the competition between the Eastern and Western blocs in the world. Due to the increased attention to the situation in the Far East, aid to that region will inevitably increase. One of the largest amounts will be the $4 billion needed for the second year of the European Recovery Program. In addition, over $1.5 billion in military aid is expected to be requested to reorganize the military equipment of Western Europe, making it the first line of defense for the United States. Regarding aid to China, approximately $450 million will be requested for economic aid and over $250 million for military aid, while the current total economic and military aid plan for China is only $400 million.

### British Commonwealth Prime Ministers Initiate Effort to Form Global Anti-Communist Alliance; Imperial Conference Plenary Session Reconvenes After Eighteen-Day Recess

[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] The plenary session of the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference adjourned today and will reconvene on the 18th. In the meantime, group meetings will be held to study various issues and seek solutions to some difficult problems. Some delegates will take this opportunity to travel elsewhere before the plenary session resumes. For example, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt will go to Paris today, and Indian Prime Minister Nehru will also go to Paris tomorrow.

[United Press, London, 14th] The heads of the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, after repeated behind-the-scenes consultations in recent days, have initiated a movement to organize a new "balancing force" against communism worldwide. It was learned on the 14th that their aim is to organize a new alliance, spanning Europe, Africa, and as far as the Far East, to form a belt of joint defense and act as a buffer between the two major powers, East and West. If this plan succeeds, 500 million people will unite to support the Western countries. The objectives of the British Commonwealth leaders are: (1) To dissuade India from leaving the Commonwealth and becoming an independent republic, so as to prevent India from becoming a victim of the communist fifth column in the Far East. They hope to firmly retain India within the Commonwealth as part of the "balancing force." (2) To use all means to bring Burma back into the Commonwealth. Burma's secession from the Commonwealth a year ago made it a good place for communist rebellion. (3) To step up the organization of Africa as a second line of defense. This is what the defense plan soon to be drafted by the Western European Union proposes. New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser and Australian Foreign Minister Evatt have exerted pressure on India not to leave the Eastern and Western blocs. Whether India participates in the new strategic system depends on Nehru's ability. According to the Independence Act, India and Pakistan have the right to leave the Empire. Indian public opinion insists that India should be a republic and ultimately break away from the British Empire. When Nehru returns home, Indians plan to hear his report on his declaration of secession at the conference. Nehru has now heard opinions from all sides and is in a dilemma.

### Belgian Communists' Anti-Government Conspiracy; Attempt to Incite Labor Unrest in Coordination with France and Italy; Authorities Take Precautionary Measures

[United Press, Brussels, 14th] According to an informed source in the Belgian counter-intelligence agency on the 14th: The Comintern Information Bureau has instructed the Belgian Communist Party to use all its strength to overthrow the Spaak government. A few days ago, the Belgian Communist Central Committee was ordered to incite a movement to raise wages. He said: The counter-intelligence agency has obtained evidence confirming that this movement is actually linked to and coordinated with France and Italy. When the reporter asked how the Communist Party would proceed to overthrow the government, he replied: "We are already aware and have taken the necessary precautionary measures. This is all I can tell you." Three days ago, Belgian Communist Party Secretary-General Lalmont gave a speech advocating the overthrow of the coalition government of the Socialist Party and the Conservative Party to save the country's economic crisis. He said: "Spaak is nothing more than a puppet and slave of the United States." At this time, a member of the audience suddenly stood on his seat and shouted, "If I could sacrifice my life to make Spaak die, I would feel supremely happy." When Lalmont mentioned that Spaak would deliver a speech on the work of the United Nations on the 20th, he added: "We must show this person our strength, so that the current Belgian Prime Minister knows how strong our strength has become. We will all attend when Spaak speaks."

### Political Committee Subcommittee Meets; Examines Disarmament Proposals

It recommended that the subcommittee should review various issues concerning the reduction of armaments, taking into account the resolutions of the subcommittee responsible for studying the issue of atomic energy control. The Political Committee adjourned for one day because tomorrow is a Muslim holiday. According to the agenda, the Palestinian issue should be discussed after the Soviet disarmament proposal.

### Business is Too Good; Everyone is Complaining; Rice Suppliers Refuse to Accept Contracts; Restaurants Apply to Close Down

[This Newspaper Report] Since the authorities strictly stipulated that daily necessities must be purchased with certificates, the general public's purchases have been restricted, and waste has been reduced. However, on the other hand, restaurants and rice suppliers have been greatly distressed by the purchase restriction policy. According to the recent statistics report of the restaurant industry, families with fewer ordinary people are finding it difficult to buy vegetables every day and are turning to rice suppliers for rice, or the whole family goes to restaurants to eat fixed-price meals. The largest consumption of fixed-price meals is oil and rice. Currently, the industry's purchases of oil and rice are entirely dependent on household registration certificates. In addition, the Social Affairs Bureau allocates 170 pounds of flour per store per month. On average, the amount allocated to each store per month is often not enough for ten days of retail sales. Rice suppliers, due to limited inventory, have recently refused to accept contracts from customers. Many restaurants have also applied to the association for temporary closure. The industry association stated that in order to help all members overcome the current difficulties, in addition to immediately compiling statistics on the actual sales volume of oil, vegetables, meat, chicken, etc. of each member each month and forwarding them to the Social Affairs Bureau to request that it coordinate allocation, it will also apply to the Social Affairs Bureau for a purchase permit so that the industry can directly purchase rice in rice-producing areas outside of Shanghai, so as to continue to maintain the supply of meals to customers.

### Precious Gems and Jade are Vanishing; Average Price More Than Doubles

[This Newspaper Report] According to people in the pearl and jade industry, the industry's business usually peaks in August and September of the lunar calendar, because there are more festive events on the market at this time, and the demand for precious jewelry such as pearls and diamonds also increases. This year, the floating funds from the authorities' redemption of gold notes have also partly tended to search for pearls and diamonds, causing the high-end goods of pearls and diamonds on the market to disappear. The items that are usually bought and sold by colleagues are all mid-to-low-end goods. It is said that high-end goods are collected and treasured by collectors. Even if they occasionally flow out, those who can afford to buy them must treat them as treasures and keep them without selling them again. Currently, the items traded in the industry are mainly pearls, diamonds, and jadeite, and the average price is more than double what it was in 1919. It is said that prices in Tianjin are even more expensive than Shanghai. Yesterday, the reporter went to the pearl and jade market on Houjia Road. The market was still very lively, and trading seemed to be very prosperous. However, according to people in the industry, the actual transaction volume is only 70% of what it was in 1919. There are more than 100 members in the industry. The number of people engaged in the pearl and jade industry nationwide, including Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Xinjiang, is approximately 2 million. Recently, there has been talk that the authorities will stop the sale of luxury jewelry such as pearls and diamonds. The industry believes that many pearls and diamonds are domestically produced, and those who operate this business have a long history, so it seems inappropriate to classify it as the sale of prohibited imported luxury goods. Therefore, it has submitted a petition requesting that it be allowed to continue operating.

### Pacification and Reconstruction Team Holds Memorial Service for Martyred Cadres; Chiang Ching-kuo Earnestly Encourages Comrades

[This Newspaper Report] The Pacification and Reconstruction Team held a memorial service for martyred cadres at the Lawyers Association at 3 pm yesterday. All officers stationed in Shanghai attended the service, and the atmosphere was very solemn. Chiang Ching-kuo personally presided over the ceremony, earnestly encouraging comrades to have the determination not to fear death and the spirit of sacrificing oneself for righteousness, to engage in revolutionary work. He firmly stated that the economic management of the city can gradually get on the right track and fundamentally solve the people's livelihood problems. His only hope is that the people will not panic, so as not to disrupt the steps. As for the fact that some citizens have many complaints about the current purchase restriction measures implemented by the authorities, he said that this is a manifestation of the impatience of the middle class. Today, they seem to have forgotten the stormy waves of price changes by the day in the past, and they do not know that if the purchase restriction measures are not implemented and the August 19 price limits are not strictly observed, then all commodity prices in the city may be transferred into the hands of scalpers and speculators within five or six days. Therefore, our methods can be changed, but our principles and position, once decided, will never change, and we will never deviate from our original intentions due to environmental stimuli, pressure, or temptation.

### False Alarm Due to Damaged Alarm Bell; Plainclothes Police Break into Home; Famous Educator Hides Under Bed

[This Newspaper Report] At about 3:30 pm yesterday, the Shanghai Electric Tramway Company on Changde Road was having its alarm bell repaired by a telephone company. Unexpectedly, the two lines touched each other, and the alarm bell at the Jing'an Temple Police Station rang loudly. Director Du immediately ordered Criminal Division Chief Yu Ding to lead a large number of police officers to rush to the scene in a police car. At the same time, he urgently reported to the General Bureau to send more flying fortresses and red police cars. After arriving at the destination, it was discovered that it was caused by a short circuit. Coincidentally, more than an hour later, the police station's alarm bell rang again. Upon learning that a case had occurred at No. 55, Lane 189, Jiangsu Road, Wuding Road, the original group of police officers boarded several jeeps and rushed to the scene. Soon, after hearing the news, the Criminal Division of the General Bureau also ordered Section Chief Feng Qishan to supervise Inspector Qin Boliang, police officer Ma Bingzhang, and others to drive to the scene. Flying fortresses and armed police officers from the Jiangning Road reserve team also arrived at the scene. The house is the residence of the famous educator Yin Zhiling. The Yin family suddenly saw a large number of plainclothes police officers breaking into the house, mistakenly believing them to be bandits. They pressed the alarm bell several times to warn the police and hurriedly opened the silver box and moved away valuable items. The male and female masters and servants all hid. Yin also temporarily hid under the Simmons mattress. After Section Chief Yu and others explained their intentions, they realized it was a misunderstanding. The house's alarm bell had also failed and was being repaired, causing the second false alarm.

### Life Bookstore - Selling - Reactionary - Books - Trainee Manager - Indicted

The Life Bookstore ordered reactionary books. Xue Dichang (from Wujin), the manager of the store, and Chen Zhengda (from Ningbo), a trainee, were yesterday indicted by the Special Criminal Court for endangering the nation. Xue Dichang, as the manager of the Shanghai Life Bookstore, contacted the Hong Kong Life Bookstore to order various reactionary books and promoted and propagated communism in the country.

The defendant Zhang Renyou, of medium build, neatly dressed, first made a statement on the organization, personnel, authority, and case handling procedures of the Water Police Bureau in response to questions from the court. Then, regarding the facts of the crime listed in the District Procuratorate's indictment, he stated separately:

Zhang Renyou - Substitute term

(1) Regarding the part accused of concealing evidence: Song Rende was instigated by Tao Qiyun and Ding Zhushi to be cut. According to the opinion signed by the judicial section chief of the bureau, bail was granted to Tao and Ding, and it was reported to the General Bureau for review and continued investigation, which can be verified. The accusation of "not pursuing the matter and not transferring it to the court" is untrue. (2) Regarding the defendant's dereliction of duty and the US dollar transactions of Tan Wenxi and others: The defendant stated that since taking office, he had been ordered to thoroughly rectify the wharves along the river, from the Waibaidu Bridge to the 16th Pier, fearing that it would hinder international appearances. The authorities paid particular attention to this. At that time, Baili Automobile Company was operating a US military business car service at Pier No. 10 on the Bund, and the private construction of wooden pavilions was an illegal building. The demolition was signed by patrol officer Luo Zhaoqiang of the bureau. Shen Huanling, the head of the first section of the bureau, said that the person in charge of the company, Xiong Du, had a bad attitude and planned to detain him for two days to show deterrence. Later, Chief Xu of the Foreign Affairs Section of the General Bureau notified by telephone that the Baili wooden pavilion was for the use of the US military and did not need to be strictly pursued, so it was reprimanded. Luo patrol officer's report did not mention the US dollar transaction of the company. It was later found that the US military used coupons for general use in designated venues, such as US military clubs, restaurants, swimming pools, etc. (Xu Chief's certificate and US dollar coupons were presented in court.)

Gun-carrying sailing ship - No suspicion found

(3) Regarding the defendant and Xia Zhemin receiving bribes: The defendant stated that the boat owner Zhou Daiqing's sailboat contained ten rifles, one thousand and three bullets, two wooden imitation rifles, and one hundred and thirty-two bullets. After investigation by the judicial staff of the bureau, Zhou Daiqing held a certificate from the Lanxiu Township Office, stating that he was applying for a license from the Ministry of Interior and there was no suspicion of private transportation. He was granted bail, so he was not transferred to the General Bureau. (4) Regarding the defendant's extortion of property by means of excuses: The defendant stated that on the day he took office, the case of Guo Liangzhen, the chief of general affairs of the New Fu Shen Steamer Company, and others involving manslaughter occurred, which was handled by Deputy Director Yan Shaobai. He was completely unaware of it and did not know the company's manager, Wu Delin. If there was any extortion, please summon witnesses to the court to inquire who received the bribe. (5) Regarding the defendant and Huang Boqian's encroachment on public property: The defendant stated that the bureau had a technical section responsible for the management of various fuel machinery. He took office on March 17, and the subordinate responsible personnel did not report that the No. 8 speedboat was damaged, so he still reported the amount of diesel oil as before. After investigation, he reported to the General Bureau that the amount of oil requested was incorrect and asked for correction. The General Bureau approved the record and denied that it was secretly reported and still protected without asking questions.

Selling Items at Ballgames - Fundraising to Repair House

(6) Regarding the defendant and Xie Yiyun's fraud of property: The defendant stated that Cao Yusheng's part of the theft of Texaco diesel was handled by staff member Xie Yiyun. As far as he knew, Xie was careful, cautious, hardworking, experienced, and not bribed. (7) Regarding Huang Boqian's theft of public property, seeking benefits from non-主管 affairs, and encroachment on public property: The defendant stated that at the beginning of his tenure, the bureau's buildings were dilapidated and the funds were short. The volunteer police held a ballgame to raise funds to supplement the insufficient funds for repairing the bureau's buildings. At one bureau affairs meeting, Deputy Director Yan and General Affairs Section Chief Huang attended and agreed to sell ownerless iron anchors, scrap iron wire, and old magnetic bathtubs outside the bureau to raise funds. He did not know about the sale of stolen coal. Later, it was found that the tea room attendant A San used the section chief's name and was dismissed. After Zhang finished speaking, he said: This accusation was completely due to jealousy and false accusations. The court ordered all defendants to sit down because the trial had been going on for a long time. The remaining eight defendants had to be questioned one after another.

Gun License Photos - Submitted for Reference

Huang Boqian stated: The bureau's fuel reimbursement and use were the responsibility of staff member Chen Shaoxi. He did not know that the No. 8 speedboat was damaged beforehand and denied falsely reporting the amount of oil. The sale of magnetic basins, iron anchors, etc., was decided by the bureau affairs meeting to raise funds to supplement the bureau's building repair fees. Xia Zhemin stated: After investigation, the guns and bullets of boat owner Zhou Daiqing were consistent with the certificate from the Lanxiu Township Office. Because there was no suspicion of private transportation, he was granted bail. The deputy director was not in the bureau that day, so he directly submitted it to Director Zhang for approval. Qin Shuming stated: He did not know Xia Zhemin and denied bribery. Zhou Daiqing stated: His sailboat sailed from Fuzhou, passed through Chongming, and arrived at Wusong. The guns and bullets were for defense against bandits. Because the gun license was expired, the Lanxiu Township Office temporarily issued a certificate and applied for a license from the Ministry of Interior at the same time, which has now been issued. After the statement, his defense lawyer submitted new gun license photos for the court's reference. Tan Wenxi stated: He is a shareholder of Baili Automobile Company, and the business is the responsibility of the manager and deputy manager. Liang Jinhao stated: He is the deputy manager of Baili. The wooden pavilion built on the Bund was for the convenience of US Navy personnel. The US dollar coupons received were still exchanged for legal tender. He did not ask anyone to intercede when the bookstore was shut down. Finally, Luo Zhaoqiang and Xie Yiyun answered and denied accepting bribes by virtue of their authority. The court stated that the facts of the case were generally clear and adjourned the meeting, and the witnesses will be summoned to the court for questioning next time.

### No Silk Available in the Market

The distribution of rayon by the association yesterday remained the same, and the number of applicants was slightly higher than the previous day.

The sales of silk shops are limited daily, and the turnover is also weak, and the market is deserted.

There were limited transactions of raw silk on a case-by-case basis. Because foreign firms have no goods to buy, absorption has stopped, and transactions are stagnant. Most domestic sales account holders are mostly watching, and the supply on the market is scarce, but silk factories are in great need, and the market shows that there are goods with no price.

### Beijing-Suzhou Travel Notes

— Ji Yong

Spring and autumn are the seasons for Suzhou and Hangzhou. I am not very familiar with Hangzhou, but as for Suzhou, I am afraid that a small part of its prosperity relies on the occasional visits of wealthy young masters. Those of us who have lived in Suzhou for a long time feel that it is an ancient and declining city. There are no pedestrians in the deep alleys, and old women are miserably reeling silk or hunching over embroidering. This is an 18th-century picture of farming and weaving. Not to mention Shanghai, even Wuxi, its neighbor to the west, is probably rarely seen. And the ancestral halls and villas dotted in the alleys, the abandoned gardens, give people infinite historical sorrow. I am from Beijing, and I feel that it has some similarities with the old capital. These large cities that have been relieved of their responsibilities are heading towards the grave, and our origins and circumstances will often let out two sighs at this sunset, and there is nothing we can do. Therefore, I dare not even go to Tiger Hill and Lingyan Temple, for fear of causing deeper and heavier disillusionment.

Even so, the shops on Guanqian Street have been emptied by the rush to buy. I have walked through several foreign goods stores and cannot buy a good tube of toothpaste. Meat is also often unavailable. The people of Suzhou are law-abiding and do not necessarily all want to hoard, and they don't have that much spare money either. Obviously, some "cows" from Shanghai are playing tricks, coupled with the wealthy travelers joining in the fun, even the shelves of Cai Zhi Zhai are empty, and there is no way to buy some white sugar plums. Honest businessmen are not happy about this, but fearful. The week before, several large gold stores expanded their "temporary closure," fearing that they would follow suit. The most wonderful thing is that on the day I left Suzhou, when the time came to go to the station, I ran along Lindun Road, and no one was willing to go. I thought, could it be that labor is also being hoarded? Later, after inquiring in detail, I learned that it was because the order at the station was not good, especially those who acted as brokers, first disrupted the passengers and then recommended them to other drivers, taking a commission from it, causing the passengers to suffer all kinds of deception. So the station added wooden barriers around it, not allowing empty cars to enter the barriers or empty cars to leave the barriers, so the drivers were unwilling to go to the station, fearing that they would not be able to pick up passengers and would be detained. The Suzhou station drivers are notoriously fierce, but as a result, there is not even a single car, isn't it even more inconvenient for passengers? I don't know if it has improved these past two days.

The train is only more relaxed on the reserved seat trains, and all other trains are filled with smugglers. Smugglers do not not want to buy reserved seat tickets, but they are afraid of spot checks on the train. Looking at the dynamics of the social economy, smugglers are also a major sign. If someone wishes to write a history of Chinese smuggling, there will definitely be several very interesting chapters that can benefit people's wisdom. And today, the preservation and circulation of various materials should also be given special attention, so I carefully cut and pasted the photos of scalpers selling Western medicine in the Shen Bao into my photo album.

The first threat Nanjing gave us was also "cars." When we got off the train, it was just past 8 o'clock in the evening, and the cars of the Jiangnan Company were ready to go to the factory and would not carry passengers. The ticket office posted a sign saying "Few vehicles, please do not wait," which was much more threatening to us than the announcement "Cinema is full today, please come back early tomorrow." The Capital Company still had two cars, but at least four or five hundred people were crowded there to get on the car. I quickly found wild chicken taxis, one yuan per person, with no room for negotiation, so I had to squeeze in and become a sardine. Each car must be filled with seven passengers, plus the driver and the assistant, a total of nine people. It is said to be yellow croaker, how about calling it sardines? This is not even considered a rip-off. I took a rickshaw after getting off the bus at Xinjiekou. The distance that was only a dime half a month ago is now at least 3 jiao, and some ask for 5 jiao. I carried my travel bag and walked for more than ten minutes, and finally hired a rickshaw for 700,000 legal tender. I said to him, "How come the price of cars has risen so fiercely? 700,000 can buy more than a liter of rice, it used to be able to go to Xiaguan!" "Sir, rice is cheap, you can't talk about rice!" We civil servants really don't know what it feels like to hear this kind of talk. Others talk about rice when rice is expensive, and talk about money when rice is cheap. Only civil servants and teachers always value their salaries at the lowest standard, and it is really enough for people to arrange a life with a monthly salary of less than 100 yuan at this moment!

### Near Sentences in the Deep Clouds

— Bai Jiao

Written at the request of Great Awakening Dharma Master, abbot of Xuebao Temple in Fenghua

Siming Peak stands out with Xuebao's grace,
The ancient temple, renowned for a thousand years, once faced,
Whose predesessors, the masters Mingjue ever sought,
Since the Song Dynasty, who has been so prominent?
The Venerable Taixu is now following the lineage,
Listening to the sutras, he is again awakening a hibernating dragon,
How many disciples are there throughout the land?
Among them, the disciples are exceptionally pure,
Suddenly departing and flying off towards the Eastern Heavens,
Residing in silence, he will soon face ten thousand verdant hills,
Thinking only of the old recluse in the clouds,
Promising to enter the mountains to see the scenery together.
The recluse seeks in vain without a carefree heart,
After nine years of drunkenness, he still lingers,
He is truly saddened by the many selves in the world,
Desiring to knock on the door, what can the teacher do?

### Quick People, Quick Deeds

— Le

There are many people who like to cough or "sniffle" when listening to famous speakers or watching plays. Sometimes when the scene on stage is a little "cold," the audience is simply holding a cold competition, ruining the tense and solemn atmosphere completely, which is really laughable and absurd.

However, British General Montgomery has a set of foolproof methods to deal with these insensitive guys. During World War II, General Montgomery often gathered his subordinates every Saturday afternoon to personally deliver speeches. He was famous for hating smoking. Even the prominent American Wendell Willkie had bumped into his nail because he smoked while eating, so of course none of these listeners dared to smoke anymore, and everyone sat in silence. At this time, General Montgomery would stride to the stage, first without saying a word, staring sternly at the listeners for a minute or two, and then, in an icy tone, he would say: "I will give you two minutes specifically to let you cough and wake up your sniffling. After that, when I speak, it should be quieter."

The listeners were always silent from then on, listening quietly to the training.

### On Panic Buying

— Ze Shi

I happily purchased "The Fate of Mankind" for fourteen yuan and brought it home. I was just lighting a cigarette and planning to read it when my wife, who was counting a few banknotes, spoke up: "I should have bought flour, kerosene, and yarn a long time ago, but I kept delaying it. Now they are even more expensive. People who don't panic buy are destined to suffer!" Hearing this, I couldn't help but put down the book and started to think wildly. After thinking for a while, I felt that people who panic buy are truly enemies of themselves, or at least have no benefit to themselves. Let me briefly discuss it.

According to the newspapers, even embroidered shoes have become targets in the panic buying spree. According to my own observations, people have long been lining up in front of gold shops, wearing through the threshold. The reason for panic buying is nothing more than (1) fear that money is worthless, or (2) that everyone has a lot of money. If it is the former, then the more you panic buy, the more worthless the money will become. For example, if the limited price of woolen cloth was originally one yuan per foot, the shop owner would not dare to raise the price if you didn't panic buy. But if you panic buy, he would at least mix fish eyes with pearls, treating inferior goods as superior goods. At this time, as long as you have goods to buy, you don't care about the quality of the goods. The words of a cigarette peddler that I quoted in my article "A Microscopic View of a Cigarette" are the best explanation: "You can't buy it even if you want to, so who cares if it's moldy?" Indiscriminate panic buying is precisely what promotes the point where money that was originally valuable becomes worthless. I have a pair of pants at home that adults can't wear and children find too big, neither Chinese nor Western. When I oppose my family's panic buying, I use this as a metaphor: when I first bought these pants, I must have thought I was getting a bargain, but looking at it today, although the value of these pants at that time is certainly not worth even a penny in gold yuan, what value do these pants have other than occupying a corner of the drawer? This is talking about unnecessary items. Even daily necessities such as soap, kerosene, and coal briquettes, I do not approve of panic buying. First, how long can what I can panic buy last? Having enough for a year is already a lot, but I always want to live to be eighty years old. Second, for more than ten years, Chinese people have often panic bought things, but none of the people who panic bought have not lived in constant hardship. What good has it done to people who have panic bought a box or two of soap! I think: the gains and losses of panic buyers are as follows:

Gain: Bought a cheap load or box of soap.

Loss: Caused the price of kerosene, matches, grass paper, etc., and even all things, to rise.

Gain: Bought enough of all items for a year, with no fear of rising prices for a year.

Loss: Caused the price of all things to rise for several years thereafter.

(If the items are used up and the person also dies, then of course they have gained an advantage.)

Accordingly, I do not panic buy anything—at most books. Because you can't finish panic buying even if you have money, especially since panic buying can only lead to rising prices, which is like lifting a brick to crush your own feet.

I am making this argument not to show that I, the master, have money and don't care and am speaking cool words, or that I am letting out a Ah Q tantrum. I feel that what Chinese people, from top to bottom, often do is often aimed at selfishness and self-interest, but ends up harming themselves, so I am taking this opportunity to express my views. As for those who really have a lot of money and panic buy things, their foolishness is even more lamentable, and I will continue to discuss it.

### A Study of the Origins of Public Utilities in Shanghai

— Zhong Jian

The development of public utilities is a symbol of a modern city. Today, cities and villages in Europe and America can universally enjoy affordable electricity and water supplies. When these enterprises were first established in China, they were instead severely hindered, and there were many ridiculous facts. Therefore, I will briefly describe the origins of public utilities in Shanghai as follows:

Gas. In the third year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty (1864), the Shanghai Gas Company was established, and the Municipal Council granted it a permit to lay main pipes underground. The following year, the original oil lamps on the roads in the concession were also converted into gas street lights.

Electric Lights. After using gas lamps for a long time, residents gradually felt that the light was dim and expressed dissatisfaction. In the eighth year of Guangxu (1882), an American named R.W. Little requested permission from the Municipal Council to use street light wooden poles and add more electric poles to test the friction power generation method. In June of that year, Little installed a sample lamp on the high platform of the Bund Park, and viewers all exclaimed its beauty. Later, he requested permission to install electric lights in Chinese homes, the Shanghai Club, and the French Concession. However, electric lights were a novel thing at the time, and were easily met with opposition. The Shanghai Daotai said that electricity was dangerous and could kill people and destroy houses, turning the entire city into a flat ground. Unless electricity was immediately stopped, it would inevitably cause disaster. The gas company also strongly opposed it, fearing that its business would be affected after electric lights were developed. Since then, the two companies competed for many years. Although the electricity business eventually won, gas still has uses in households and industries, so it has been able to maintain its business to this day.

Telephone. In the seventh year of Guangxu (1881), the Great Northern Telegraph Company also operated the Shanghai telephone business. At that time, in addition to the Municipal Council agencies, there were only 338 telephone users in the city.

Tap Water. Shanghai's water supply has always relied on the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek. Well water is salty and undrinkable, and river water is dirty and unsuitable. It was not until the sixth year of Guangxu that the Municipal Council contracted with foreign merchants Drysdale Ringer Co. to install water pipes and set up a water tower on Jiangxi Road. In April of the ninth year of Guangxu (1883), water began to be released. At that time, Li Hongzhang was in Shanghai and personally attended the opening ceremony. However, the citizens at that time were half-believing and half-doubting. On the one hand, the company charged water fees, and on the other hand, they did not understand the function of tap water, believing that the water was poisonous, or that the water was electroplated, or even that someone had drowned under the water tower. The Mixed Court was forced to issue a notice to dispel the public's doubts.

### Eastern Scales, Western Claws

— Jin Lin

The French natural scientist Van Bob discovered the oldest tree in the world in West Africa, which is more than six thousand years old.

The deepest point in the world's oceans is in the Pacific Ocean between the Philippines and Japan, where the depth is 32,000 feet.

There is a strange profession in New York, which is to remove chewing gum residue stuck to the road, with a weekly salary of twenty-five US dollars. This profession is still a world first.

The lightest mineral in the world, beryllium, can now be woven into cloth, which is as soft and smooth as real silk.

### Record of Zhao Shu

— Peng Yusheng

Zhao Huishu (Zhiqian), in his early years, was so poor he didn't even have an awl to stand on. He once lived in a watchtower on the city walls of Shaoxing. At the time, Miao Wulie (Zi), the governor of Suyang, was an official in the area. One day, he happened to see a Spring Festival couplet made by Zhao. He greatly appreciated it and immediately hired him as a staff member. He also praised him among the high-ranking officials in the capital. As a result, Huishu's calligraphy and paintings of bronze and stone inscriptions became highly sought after, and their value increased tenfold. Many talented people at the time, such as Pan Boyin, Wei Jiashun, and Shen Yunchu, were impressed by his talent and eagerly sought to befriend him.

In the tenth year of Xianfeng, the Taiping army captured Hangzhou, and Wulie died in battle while supervising the defense. General Ruichang requested a posthumous honor, which was approved. However, Governor Wang Youling, relying on his favor, was arrogant and overbearing, and had a long-standing dislike for Wulie. This was because Wulie had once criticized him for not ascending to office through proper channels (Wang was originally a border commissioner who was recognized and promoted by Commander-in-Chief He Guiqing. Within a few years, he was promoted to Jiangsu Provincial Administration Commissioner, and then to Zhejiang Governor.) As a result, he used excuses such as "stubbornly adhering to his own opinions, initiating the idea of defending the city, leading to the fall of the provincial capital, and being unable to escape blame" to request the revocation of Wulie's posthumous honors, in order to vent his anger. Huishu believed that Wulie had indeed died in battle while supervising the defense, and his death was extremely tragic. Moreover, he had served as an official with integrity, achieving great accomplishments. He defended Quzhou, protected western Zhejiang, and his contributions were particularly great. Therefore, he and Shao Xieyuan and others submitted a petition to the Censorate, defending him. Later, after successive appeals by Governor-General Zuo Zongtang, Governor Li Hanzhang, and Provincial Treasurer Jiang Yifeng, the original posthumous honors were finally restored, and he was given the posthumous title "Wulie." Funds were also allocated to build a special ancestral hall for him at Jin Yazhuang in Hangzhou. Sun Yulong, the garrison commander, and Ding Chunhan, the groom, who died in battle at the same time as Wulie, were also enshrined there.

Miao Ziting (Defen), Wulie's son, became an observer in Jiangxi. Huishu was able to serve in the Jiangxi Local Records Bureau with his help. Later, he became the magistrate of Nancheng, where he gained a good reputation. It was said that the Nancheng county office had a snake spirit, and all officials who served there were devout and respectful. Only Huishu did not believe in it, even calling it a demon. Not long after, he died of illness. Elders passed down the story that he died because of the snake, but in reality, he died of typhoid fever.

Huishu's calligraphy and paintings of bronze and stone inscriptions were all exquisite and highly valued by the art world for a long time. His meticulously crafted works were mostly collected by Wulie's descendants. I have more than a thousand of his handwritten letters and more than twenty album leaves and informal notes, which were also dispersed from Wulie's family.

### Miscellaneous Notes on a Mouse Peeking into the Pavilion

— Ma Shou

Looking at the Prefaces of the White Flower Collection on the Two Chens

The elder poets of the poetry world have almost all withered away. The graves of the two elders, Sanyuan and Shiyi, are also overgrown with trees. Sanyuan cultivated himself to a very high level in his later years, and his poetic realm was especially simple and natural. The saying "Geng Jie of Yuzhang, a famous tree in the world, spirited and straightforward, meticulous and erudite" can truly be called the best in modern times. Shiyi, on the other hand, sang and danced in the world, having a son and taking a concubine at seventy, symbolizing the lightness and vigor of his poetic pursuits. Compared to Sanyuan, who swam in the great peace, peaceful and content, there was indeed a question.

Compared in an old bookstore, seeing Zhang Mojun's "White Flower Thatched Cottage Poetry Collection," and obtaining the prefaces of the two Chens, the sentiments and styles are different. Sanyuan's work is very concise in its wording, but the meaning is sincere. What he expresses in praise of Mojun is appropriate to her status, and there is no regret. Shiyi's work is not very serious, and comparing Mojun to Shangguan Wan'er is perhaps a little too frivolous. The literary style is also dull, and the allusions are mixed up. It is truly a spontaneous piece of writing. Mojun arranged it after Sanyuan's, and her intention was probably to express some kind of comfort.

The most interesting thing is that the two Chens' prefaces write a lot about Mojun's father, Zhang Bochun, and very little about Mojun herself. This is a special style of writing a preface, and it is also the intention of the two elders at the time.

Social Services Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation

### The Ugly Drama of a Clan Society: The Clan Chief Uses Violence to Force Adoption

To the Editor: My uncle passed away early and had no children. He did not instruct anyone to inherit his estate before his death. This spring, my aunt adopted my cousin as her son and invited the clan chief and local gentry to draw up a contract, requiring my eldest brother to sign it. My eldest brother refused because we have three brothers and he could not make the decision on his own (but he stated that he did not object to my aunt adopting my cousin as her heir). At that time, the clan chief, feeling his dignity was offended, severely beat my eldest brother. The reader and my second brother are doing business in Shanghai and were very upset after receiving the news. I have several questions and would like to ask for your answers: (1) Is it legal for my aunt to adopt my cousin as her heir? (2) Was my eldest brother being unreasonable in refusing to sign due to the difficulty of the situation? (3) Was the clan chief violating the law by using violence and beating him after failing to force him to sign? (4) Can we refuse to recognize my aunt's adoption of my cousin as her heir since we were not notified in advance? Reader, Cao Chun.

[Answer from Lawyer Jiang Pingfan] (1) Adoption is a remnant of clan society, and there are no provisions for it in the current civil law. According to the law, it cannot be said that your aunt's adoption of your cousin as her son is illegal. (2) It is not necessary for your eldest brother to agree to and sign the adoption of the son. (3) Battery should be responsible for criminal responsibility. (4) No notification is necessary, and it is not necessary for you to recognize it.
