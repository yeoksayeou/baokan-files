### Liaoning Completes Offensive Deployment; Naval Fleet Cruises Yingkou Waters; Siping Nationalist Troops Conduct Tactical Shift

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 6th] All quarters are now closely watching the development of the Nationalist troops. The bandits in Liaoyang have begun to waver. It seems the Nationalist troops have completed the offensive deployment on this front. If reinforcements land in Yingkou, southern Liaoning will be the meeting point. The battle in the Siping area of northern Liaoning unfolded on the evening of the 3rd from the Siping airfield. By the night of the 5th, the bandits launched fierce reinforcements. To concentrate forces, the defending troops withdrew towards the city streets. The bandits occupied the airfield and also moved towards the city streets. On the night of the 5th, bandits around Siping began to attack, engaging in fierce offensive and defensive battles. In the Liaobei and Siping areas, the bandits mustered forces including the main forces of the First, Second, Third, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth Columns, as well as Han communist Li Hongguang's detachment, and other local armed forces, numbering no less than one hundred thousand.

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 6th] There are indeed signs of progress in the military situation on the Beining Railway. Elite Nationalist troops are now advancing in multiple routes towards the predetermined areas. The Beining Railway and Yingkou Port, which are the land and sea transportation lines between western and southern Liaoning, are both targets.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 6th] China News Agency reports: The central government is indeed using the army, navy, and air force to support the Northeast. In addition to opening up the Liaoxi Corridor, it will also counter-attack Yingkou. At the moment, a Nationalist fleet sailing north from a certain port has arrived in Liaodong Bay, with a portion cruising the waters near Yingkou, monitoring the activities of the communist bandits. It will coordinate with the Nationalist troops in the counter-attack, bombarding the communist bandits in Yingkou, and then forcibly landing. The Allied air force bombers have continuously inflicted heavy damage on the communist bandits' transportation lines carrying machinery and materials from Anshan and Yingkou.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 6th] After the bandit troops who had raided the western suburban airfield at Siping were repelled, they redeployed the remnants of their forces on the night of the 4th to launch a fierce attack on our forces. The two sides engaged in fierce fighting throughout the night. To concentrate forces, our defending troops have made a strategic shift. In addition, the bandit troops who had gathered in the Siping area also began to move on the night of the 5th.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 6th] Wei Lihuang inspected Jicha from Shenyang on the 6th and will return to Shenyang on the 32nd.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 6th] Recently, the situation in Changchun has become increasingly stable, and prices are lower than in other parts of the Northeast. The military situation also holds an absolute advantage. Currently, due to close cooperation between the military and the people, bandits cannot participate in activities within 50 li outside the city, and the Nationalist troops' sweep area has been expanded to more than 70 li.

### Luo Zhuoying Flies to Shenyang to Report; Important Decisions Made with North China Authorities in Beiping; Full Coordination of Military, Political, and Economic Affairs Inside and Outside the Pass

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 6th] Full coordination of military, political, and economic affairs inside and outside the Pass has been decided in Beiping. Luo Zhuoying left Beiping at 11:00 AM on the 6th to fly to Shenyang to report. According to Luo, he visited Director Li Zongren, Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi, and Chairman Chu Xichun in the past few days. They all shared the same feeling that the Northeast and North China are as interdependent as lips and teeth and must "grasp the overall situation and devote all efforts" to deal with the communist bandits. The authorities in North China are deeply concerned about the Northeast and are even more determined not to let the flames of war in the Northeast spread inside the Pass. As for the establishment of a unified command structure in North China and the Northeast, the central government may be considering it. In fact, the battlefields in North China and the Northeast are already inseparable. During this trip to Beiping, in addition to exchanging military opinions with the authorities in North China, there was extensive discussion on the issues of troop sources, food supplies, and transportation in the Northeast. In response to the communist bandits' "three-seek policy", decisions were made on ensuring adequate food sources, troop rations, securing transportation lines, and guaranteeing spring plowing. When asked by reporters about the comparison of the current military value of Yingkou, the Beining Railway, and Shenyang and Jinzhou, Luo said that Yingkou's transportation value is far less than that of the Beining Railway. Shenyang and Jinzhou originally had equal military value, but Jinzhou's military value has increased compared to before.

They also stated that their actions after returning to Beiping will be subject to the orders of the central government. If they can contribute to alleviating the suffering of the people of the Northeast, they will not abandon their responsibility. After arriving in Shanghai yesterday, the three gentlemen attended a luncheon hosted by Northeast compatriots Shi Bingyan and Shi Weipu, and an evening banquet hosted by Ding Guitang.

### Tao Xisheng Writes

Record of Government Not Abandoning the Northeast

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Tao Xisheng, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Kuomintang, will publish an article in the upcoming issue of the Nanjing Central Daily News Weekly, Volume 3, Issue 8, stating that the government will never abandon the Northeast. The Nationalist troops have the ability to defend the major strongholds of Ji, Chang, Si, and Shen, and to open up transportation between Panyang and Yuguan. Tao, with the title of "The Doctrine of Non-Recognition," describes in his article the importance of the Northeast's position and situation, the government's importance to the Northeast, and its determination to firmly defend the Northeast.

Regarding the recent rumors of peace talks, Tao explicitly pointed out that this is a conspiracy of national defeatists. "Their intention is to prepare the Communist Party to resolve the Northeast issue again through negotiation, inducing the government to recognize the fait accompli it has created by violence in the Northeast." Tao also stated: "If the rumors of peace talks are related to the Northeast issue, we must reiterate the doctrine of non-recognition. Chinese patriots, especially our Northeast compatriots, have been fighting for the doctrine of non-recognition for more than a decade. The struggle of those who do not recognize will not end until the Northeast's territorial sovereignty is restored."

Chu emphasized the slogan of "funds to the countryside, talent to the countryside," saying: "We must fight the communist bandits in the countryside."

### Ministry of Finance Intensifies Crackdown on Trading in Gold and Foreign Currency

### Improvement in Remittance Import Methods; Increase in Overseas Remittances

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 6th] Overseas remittances have been repeatedly urged by the Ministry of Finance to the handling banks and bureaus to make practical improvements, and the remittance procedures should be simplified as much as possible to benefit overseas relatives. Recently, the Bank of China has implemented a method of directly delivering remittances to the recipients in areas near Guangzhou where the families of overseas Chinese are concentrated and writing letters on their behalf, which is convenient for the relatives of overseas Chinese, so the amount of overseas remittances has increased in recent months. The amount of overseas remittances received by the Bank of China in the second half of last year and January of this year, converted into national currency value, is listed below: July: 1,737,681.234 yuan, August: 8,928,804.166 yuan, September: 21,235,537.368 yuan, October: 34,616,974.458 yuan, November: 17,231,228.576 yuan, December: 40,904,218.198 yuan, January of the 37th year: 60,844,156.076 yuan.

### Our Country Recognizes the Siamese Government; Diplomatic Relations Between the Two Countries Resume Yesterday

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 6th] Our government officially recognized the new Siamese government on the 6th and resumed Sino-Siamese diplomatic relations. According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 6th: After the coup in Siam on November 9th of last year, general elections were held on January 29th of this year in accordance with the provisions of the constitution. The Democratic Party in the new National Assembly's lower house has a majority of seats. Nai Khuang, the leader of the Democratic Party, was subsequently ordered on February 20th to form a cabinet and obtained a vote of confidence from the lower house on March 5th. The Chinese government believes that the current Siamese government is a legitimate government unanimously supported by its people, and Nai Khuang has stated in a note that the Siamese government will fully fulfill all its international obligations. It has decided to recognize the new Siamese government from March 6th and restore normal diplomatic relations between the two countries.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The former Siamese government's ambassador to China, Tularak, told reporters: He has not yet received official notification from the Chinese government recognizing the current Siamese government. "Once the Chinese government recognizes the new Siamese government, I will leave China and go elsewhere, either to Siam or elsewhere." Tularak stated: If his return to Siam is safe, he will return to Siam; otherwise, he will go elsewhere, but it is currently difficult to decide. Note: After the coup in Siam on November 9th of last year, Tularak publicly stated that he would not obey the orders of the new government.

### Must Use Real Names for Deposits and Remittances in Banks and Bureaus; Chairman's Handwritten Instruction to the Ministry of Finance to Draft Implementation Measures

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 6th] Chairman Chiang attaches great importance to the control of finance and remittances. He recently instructed the Ministry of Finance in his own handwriting that depositors and remitters in all banks and bureaus must use their real names when handling deposits and remittances and that implementation measures should be drafted immediately. After receiving the instructions, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Coinage Department to be responsible for drafting them. It is reported that there have been measures restricting the use of names in the past, and they will be strictly implemented in the future. In addition, when making deposits and remittances in large cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, identity cards may be required.

He told the United Press reporter: "I, MacArthur, and General Wedemeyer all agree on assisting the Chinese government in resisting the Chinese Communists. I greatly admire the opinions of MacArthur and Wedemeyer and have always advocated assisting China. This position remains unchanged."

### US Democratic Senator Taylor's Absurd Proposal

Actually Asks MacArthur and Wedemeyer to Resign

[United Press, Washington, 5th] Democratic Senator Taylor wrote to President Truman today stating that MacArthur's and Wedemeyer's proposed foreign policy is greatly different from the government's established policy and is obviously in collusion with Wallace's criticism of the government's policy. They should be asked to resign. MacArthur and Wedemeyer's presentation of their opinions to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, intending to provide military assistance to the Chinese government, is in conflict with the government's policy.

### Commodity Tax and Domestic Tobacco and Alcohol Tax; Two Amendment Regulations; Legislative Yuan's Financial and Economic Committees Review and Approve

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 6th] The Legislative Yuan's Financial and Economic Committees held a joint meeting on the morning of the 6th to review and approve the amended Commodity Tax Regulations and Domestic Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Regulations submitted by the Ministry of Finance. The main points of the amendments are: (1) Revision of the evaluation method. The previous method of adjusting once every three months has been changed to evaluating once a month; (2) Adjustment of the items subject to commodity tax: (A) Adjustment of cosmetics tax rates. The cosmetics tax, with 14 categories, was introduced in October of the 35th year. Later, in order to protect domestic production, the temporary exemption from tax for five items, including cold cream, face lotion, talcum powder, cologne, and soap, was granted on November 27th of the same year. Since the government is implementing a quota system for imports and cosmetics are prohibited from being imported, the five types of goods for which taxes were suspended should be restored to taxation. Cold cream, face lotion, talcum powder, cologne, soap, hair cream, and hair oil, which are more commonly consumed, will be taxed at 20% ad valorem, and other items such as face powder, rouge, shaving soap, lipstick, perfume, nail polish, and eyebrow pencil will be taxed at 50% ad valorem. (B) Suspension of the tea tax to encourage tea exports. (C) Simplification of the items subject to taxation for wheat flour and cement. (3) Regulations stipulate that the customs office will assess and collect taxes on imported goods from foreign countries. In order to facilitate taxation, please have the customs office use the wholesale price at the port of entry as the basis for assessment and collect taxes at the corresponding rate, and have it clearly stipulated in the regulations so that there is a basis to rely on. (4) Regulations stipulate that exported goods are exempt from tax. The previous regulations stipulated that taxes should be refunded when exporting goods, but the taxation and then the tax refund placed a heavy interest burden on manufacturers and was not beneficial to the national treasury. Therefore, for important export goods that are directly reported and exported from factories, they will be directly exempted from tax. (5) Increase the standard for fixed fines, increasing the current maximum fine of 5,000 yuan stipulated in the regulations to 1,000 times, in order to be practical. (6) The confiscation of goods in violation of regulations will be executed by court decision.

### Instinct, Reason, and National Life - A Comparison Between China and Ethnic Characteristics

— Lei Haizong

The instinct and reason mentioned in the title of this article are not strict psychological terms, but rather traditional concepts in common human knowledge. Reason is a set of self-consistent principles, with grounds for holding them and reasonable justifications, but without considering the relationship to reality or whether they can be implemented. Instinct is fundamentally unsystematic, merely a feeling of knowing what to do without knowing why; but it is very powerful, and most human behavior, especially important behaviors that concern self-interest, is almost entirely determined by instinct.

This article is not about individuals, but about nations. Among nations, some have developed reason, while others have developed instinct. Generally speaking, a nation that has developed reason but whose instinct has declined is a weak nation; a nation whose instinct is strong regardless of its reason is a vibrant nation. The nation with the strongest instinct in the world today is England. "Nation above all, ethnicity above all" always has the element of a slogan in other countries to varying degrees, but the British people do not even mention such things, because it is the instinctive feeling of every Englishman, and can be said to be part of every Englishman's personality. England is known for producing many eccentrics, all kinds of eccentrics, but there is only one that is very rare, that is, an eccentric who sacrifices national interests for any theory that can be consistently justified to the end. Any heresy in the world can be believed by someone in England, and can be enthusiastically researched and debated in peacetime. But when it comes to an emergency, all theories can be abandoned, and only the interests of the nation cannot be harmed in the slightest. Foreigners often scold the British as hypocrites, as people who say one thing and mean another, and this is the reason. In fact, this is a wrongful accusation. Today, the only people in the world who can divide their personality into two independent, watertight compartments, one for instinct and one for reason, are the British. Other nations cannot keep the two from intermingling completely. England's dominance in the world for hundreds of years before the Second World War came from this.

If an example is desired, the Second World War is probably the best opportunity. In England, members of Parliament have complete freedom of speech, and their speeches in Parliament are absolutely free from any sanctions or restrictions; voting is also completely free and not subject to absolute party discipline. However, in British history, there are almost no examples of abusing this position without regard for the overall situation. For example, in the late stages of the war, Britain advanced into Greece to promote its traditional Near East policy, and when the Greek civil war broke out at the end of 1944, Britain was forced to intervene. This caused a major storm in Parliament, and many members expressed dissatisfaction with the government, based on a set of theories such as "national self-determination," "democracy," "freedom," and "justice." But when it came to the final vote, these members, in the short term, did not want to make things difficult for the government during the war, and in the long term, they all felt the importance of the country's long-term interests in the depths of their hearts. As a result, some people disregarded their previous statements and voted in favor, while others, in order to avoid formally violating their previous statements, either left the meeting or abstained, allowing those who supported the government's policies to win an absolute majority. This kind of thing happened repeatedly during the Second World War, and it is also a common occurrence in British history over the past few hundred years. Three hundred and fifty years ago, when religious competition in Europe was still strong, Spain, the leading nation of the apparent faith, launched the invincible armada to attack England. A minority of people in the British nation believed in Roman Catholicism, but they were never tempted by the internationalism represented by Spain, and unconditionally fought for the country. Even among the high-ranking admirals of the British Navy, there were those who, even though they were faithful, were still trusted by the general British public, and they themselves never excluded themselves, with no intention of sacrificing the country for theory. Therefore, the British people's instinct prevailing over reason did not begin recently, but was already the case three or four hundred years ago.

We can imagine any country being defeated and destroyed, but we cannot imagine England being destroyed by external forces. We are not saying that it is definitely impossible, but rather that we cannot imagine what kind of scene that would be. In 1940, when the Nazis destroyed France and threatened England, with the possibility of landing across the English Channel at any time, the then Prime Minister Churchill made a famous statement in a speech: "We will resist on the beaches, we will resist in the fields, we will resist in the streets, we will resist in the mountains, we will never surrender!" This was not empty talk, nor was it Churchill's personal opinion. Churchill was most representative of the British nation when he said this, and this was the feeling of the entire British people. We can only imagine England resisting even if resistance is absolutely ineffective and the entire population will still fight to the end with their bare hands. The British are the nation with the strongest survival instinct. If we speak in clichés, we can say that the British are the most patriotic. But the British people's patriotism exceeds what is generally called patriotism, so the typical British person has never talked about patriotism, just as ordinary people rarely mention their breathing, walking, or sleeping. That is a natural part of personality, so why talk about it? And what is there to talk about?

In today's post-war world, the countries of the Old Continent, whether victorious or defeated, are all riddled with holes and full of difficulties. Of all these countries, the one that is most willing to endure hardship and most willing to seek the recovery of the country without any sacrifice is England. The lives of ordinary people in England today are even harder than they were when the war was not over, but the people do not complain, and are willing to endure everything in order to grasp the future of the country. Because of the excessive consumption during the war, if judged by common sense, England should actually become a third- or fourth-rate country like France. England's ability to maintain its position as the only second-rate power besides the United States and the Soviet Union today is purely because its survival instinct makes it willing to work hard and persevere desperately. This is an unprecedented discovery of a kind of survival instinct in human history.

Conversely, the nation with the weakest instinct in the world today, so weak that it is almost extinct, is China. This is not to say that China's reason is developed, our reason is not developed. But what is alarming is that those who have a little reason have even worse instincts, and the position of their instincts in their personality is not even as good as that of ordinary ignorant villagers. Except for England, there are probably people in every country who sacrifice the fundamental interests of the country for theory, some more, some less. The most are probably in China. Many statements that originally had content and true meaning in the West have become purely theoretical after being moved to China, unrelated to past history and unrelated to today's reality, and many people can sacrifice everything for this, not counting sacrificing themselves, and also sacrificing the country. We have been making this mistake since we came into contact with Europe and the United States, and the root cause of the disease has not been eliminated to this day. This kind of behavior is probably difficult for people in other countries to understand, and the most puzzled are probably the British, because the British cannot imagine what kind of mood this is.

Reason is a tool of instinct, not its master. What drives history, governs society, and controls life is instinct, absolutely not reason. If idealists find this regrettable, then there is nothing they can do. The fact is so, and complaining will not help. Reason is not afraid of being developed, only of usurping the place of the master. As long as instinct always occupies the dominant position, the more developed reason is, the better. But once instinct degenerates and weakens, no matter how much reason there is, the life of the nation will be in danger. It is not easy to harmonize reason and instinct. England is the only nation in the world with a very high degree of reason whose instinct is not obscured by reason, and there is never a danger of being misled by theory. Such a nation based on instinct can die a violent death due to too much external force, but will not die by its own hand. All those who are in danger of destruction without external destruction must be nations whose instinct has died first. This is the truth that all patriots who want to understand history, recognize the present, and look forward to the future must never forget.

### Vice Chairman Sun Returns to Shanghai, Discusses Impressions of Taiwan, Taiwanese People's Diligent Spirit is Unmatched in the Mainland

[City News] Vice Chairman Sun Ke returned to Shanghai from Taiwan at around 3:00 PM on the 6th. He immediately met with reporters to discuss his impressions of his trip to Taiwan, saying: The stability shown in all aspects of Taiwan is beyond expectations. Factories in Taiwan Province are now recovering one after another. Although they cannot meet ideals due to insufficient conditions, the spirit of hard work shown by the management personnel of various industrial institutions indicates that they have exhausted all their abilities to revive Taiwan. The reinstatement of farmers and workers has greatly reduced the severity of the unemployment problem, and the people are now able to maintain their livelihoods. Regarding the future construction of Taiwan Province, there is no doubt that the increase in the production of major agricultural products such as rice and sugar cane should be the priority. To achieve the goal of increased production, the first need is to solve the fertilizer problem. The current coal production in Taiwan is about 1.5 million tons per year, and 40,000 tons are supplied to Shanghai and southern China every month. The Ministry of Economic Affairs purchases it at 1.5 million legal tender per ton and sells it at a price several times higher. This policy is actually exploiting the Taiwanese people and should be corrected as soon as possible. I believe that government agencies in Taiwan should pay a fair price for the goods they purchase in order to maintain the purchasing power of the Taiwanese people. The foreign exchange earned from Taiwan's exports should also be returned to Taiwan Province as much as possible to replenish equipment and increase production. As for the compatriots' understanding and trust of the central government, this is a major progress in Taiwan's politics. The county and city councils have all been established, and all important issues are discussed and decided by them. The past situation of separation between officials and the people has disappeared. In addition, it is worth noting that the Taiwanese people, regardless of gender, are self-reliant and diligent in making a living, and their spirit is unmatched in the mainland. Last year, Taiwan Province's grain collection achievement was 98%, which is a manifestation of their law-abiding spirit and is especially worthy of praise. The enrollment rate of school-age children in Taiwan Province is almost 100%, and textbooks are also provided free of charge. The popularization of compulsory education can also serve as a reference for various provinces in the mainland.

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 6th] Sun Ke and his wife took a flight back to Shanghai on the 6th. Chairman Wei and the heads of all departments went to the airport to see them off. He felt that his three weeks in Taiwan were a major event in his life.

### Vice President Wang Broadcasts the Significance of Holding Special Relief Donations, the Rich Should Donate Wealth to Save People and Save Themselves

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Executive Yuan Vice President Wang Yunwu broadcasted to the nation on the Central Broadcasting Station at 8:00 PM on the 6th on "Why the Government is Holding Special Relief Donations." Wang first stated three meanings of holding special relief donations: first, to balance social wealth and alleviate the impact of social problems; second, to stimulate the conscience of the wealthy and encourage their virtue of loving others, on the one hand, to relieve suffering compatriots from deep waters and on the other hand, to promote the noble sympathy of mankind; third, the wealthy must ensure the safety of their family and property by first ensuring social stability. Therefore, holding special relief donations, although to relieve refugees, is actually to ensure social security and an effective way to protect the property of the rich. In this regard, he earnestly appealed to the wealthy to support the government's decision, saying: the rich must have a long-term vision and the demeanor of the benevolent, to use a part of their own money to universally benefit all beings and relieve the suffering of all beings. Only in this way can we resolve social inequality, eliminate social hostility, so that the poor can live in peace with each other, each get what they deserve, promote the virtue of the benevolent loving others, and achieve self-help by donating wealth to save people.

He then explained the use of special relief donations, saying: According to Article 2 of the Special Relief Donation Measures passed by the State Council, the funds raised this time are limited to being used for relief undertakings and refugee relief. No one has the right to transfer these donations to other purposes. If anyone insists that the government is holding special relief donations this time to raise military expenses, then it is malicious slander, and everything should not be easily bought into.

Regarding the methods of donation, he also gave an explanation. He concluded: Finally, I appeal again to all the wealthy people in the country to generously donate and donate more money, and I also hope that the people in all places will unite and enthusiastically call on the wealthy people to donate money, and assume the responsibility of urging and encouraging, so as to make this great donation work a quick success.

### Mr. Yu Fei-peng Defends Himself Against Allegations of Profiteering by His Wife in Grain Purchases

Yesterday's Reception for Reporters in Hankou

Publicly Reprimanded the Municipal Government Secretary-General

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 6th] Minister Yu Fei-peng convened a meeting of newspaper reporters this afternoon, giving comprehensive answers to questions regarding grain administration. He also repeatedly and publicly defended himself against rumors of his wife profiteering from grain purchases, lasting for two hours. A summary of Mr. Yu's answers is as follows:

Grain Administration Issues

(A) To stabilize grain prices, the method of selling off grain reserves should no longer be used. Instead, pricing should be carefully discussed and adjusted according to supply and demand conditions at any time. (B) The allocation of American grain, according to the Sino-American agreement, is limited to the five major cities. Whether Wuhan can be allocated is still uncertain. It is hoped that the city will strive for self-sufficiency. (C) The amount of grain allocated to the five major cities is uniformly calculated based on 1.1 million people, with each person receiving one dou (approx. 10 liters). American grain will supply two-fourths of this amount, with the Ministry of Food and local governments each supplying one-fourth. This measure is intended not only for relief but also to establish a foundation for distributing grain based on population. (D) The results of the grain collection in the 36th year of the Republic (1947) have averaged 75% of the expected amount. Among them, Ningxia, Qinghai, Gansu and other provinces, due to local stability, have achieved particularly good results, all exceeding 90%. (E) The sharp rise in grain prices in Wuhan is due not only to natural factors around the Spring Festival but also to some unreasonable human-made factors. In the future, the purchase of military grain and the re-export of grain should be streamlined and managed, without allowing disorder. It is especially hoped that local governments will strengthen controls and initiate spring plowing to address the root cause.

Investigating Rumors

After responding to these questions, Mr. Yu showed no intention of discussing specific issues in detail. Instead, with an investigative and defensive tone, he turned to rumors regarding his wife profiteering from grain purchases. He stated, "This matter concerns my wife. If the family is not well managed, how can the country be governed? If this is true, I am willing to be punished by law." After speaking, he immediately asked Mayor Xu and Secretary-General Sun to explain the process of announcing this news. Mr. Sun awkwardly said, "During the economic conference, I said that according to reports, someone was falsely using the names of Mrs. Yu and Chairman Song to profiteer from grain purchases here. In order to suppress the rising prices, those impersonators should be investigated and prosecuted. My intention was to emphasize the punishment of deceitful merchants who were impersonating officials. However, the next day, a certain newspaper in Hankou published news about Mrs. Yu purchasing grain. This was an out-of-context interpretation, intentionally slandering. Although I am not responsible for this misunderstanding, I would like to express my apology to Minister Yu."

Tit-for-Tat

Then, Mr. Yu asked a reporter from a certain newspaper to explain the situation regarding the news release. For a time, the exchange was tit-for-tat, resembling a confrontation. Mayor Xu stated, "At that time, there were many rumors about rising grain prices. The municipal government investigated the export of grain by the China Grain Corporation, but there was no other malicious intent." Finally, Mr. Yu solemnly stated, "The Control Yuan has already investigated this matter four times. I have also telegraphed the supervisors of the Control Yuan and the Ministry of Food stationed in Hubei and Hunan, as well as the municipal government, to thoroughly investigate. I believe that my wife is a countrywoman and has absolutely no contact with outsiders. As for me, I have always adhered to the principle of not engaging in business while holding office. I have never interacted with merchants in my life, so how could there be any hoarding of grain?

Pursuit by Law

In short, since this is a fabricated matter, Secretary-General Sun, in his capacity as the chief of staff of a special municipality, has slandered a government leader without verifying the facts. He cannot escape legal responsibility. If a concrete response cannot be provided within three weeks to bring this matter to light, I will have no choice but to pursue legal action." Minister Yu also departed for Zhejiang by the Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou) Railway at 4 PM.

### 7,000 Shi of Grain from Fujian to Aid Guangdong

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 6th] Regarding the case of purchasing and transporting grain from Fujian to this province, Fujian Provincial Governor Liu Jianxu replied by telegram, designating 7,000 shi (approx. 700 metric tons) to be allocated in Yongding County. The provincial government has designated this batch of grain to aid the grain shortage in Chaozhou and Shantou, and Shantou City has sent personnel to purchase and transport it.

### Grain Stabilization Committee to Be Established Tomorrow

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] The Beiping Municipal Grain Allocation Committee and the U.S. Relief Material Allocation Committee are scheduled to be established on March 8.

### Continued Fluctuations in Grain Prices Unabated

Double Fish yarn was 75,500,000, a sharp increase of 2,000,000.

[Our Chengdu Dispatch, 6th] On the 5th, rice prices in Chengdu suddenly surged. On the 6th, Shuangshi (a brand of rice) reached a new high of 3,420,000. With continued price fluctuations, the provincial government is urgently suppressing prices, investigating and arresting profiteers, selling off public grain, strictly prohibiting private schools from hoarding rice for profit, and deploying troops to protect grain transport.

[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 6th] The food situation in Xi'an is becoming increasingly serious. Recently, the taxes and levies in various grain-producing areas have been exceptionally heavy, with numerous items, causing a sharp increase in transportation costs, which has affected the source of supply, resulting in shortages in the market. On the 5th, wheat had already risen to 180,000 (currency unit) per dou (approx. 10 liters). Earth flour requires 1,800,000 (currency unit) per hundred jin (approx. 50 kg). Machine flour is out of stock, and the black market price has broken through the 800,000 mark. The black market price of gold has also reached 22,600,000.

### Hangzhou Cracks Down on Illegal Grain Merchants

### Zhejiang Visiting Delegation in Jiangxi Exchanges Mutual Aid Views

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 6th] The Zhejiang visiting delegation visited the heads of various relevant agencies on the 6th. On the morning of the 7th, they will, at the invitation of Wang Lu, exchange views. Zhejiang and Jiangxi may each hold exhibitions of local products, go to various parts of the two provinces to introduce them, and exchange daily necessities. After Jiangxi banned grain exports, the Ministry of Food sent a telegram to stop this, requiring compliance with the regulations of the Executive Yuan and free circulation. The visiting delegation is scheduled to return to Hangzhou on the 10th.

### Sun Yueqi Goes to Tianjin for Inspection

Will Promote Increased Production at Paper Mill

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 6th] Mr. Sun Yueqi, Deputy Chairman of the National Resources Commission (NRC), and Mr. Ma Shiliang, Director of the NRC's Beiping Office, went to Tianjin this morning for inspection. It is reported that in addition to inspecting various NRC units, Mr. Sun will also inspect the Tianjin Paper Mill. Because the paper produced there has excessively high production costs and low output, it cannot fully meet demand, causing misunderstandings in various sectors. Mr. Sun will attempt to reduce costs and expand production to meet market demand, and produce large quantities of paper for use by newspapers in Beiping and Tianjin.

### China-India Oil Pipeline

### Five Nations Reach Agreement in Principle on Draft of Western European Alliance Treaty; Military Clauses Not Included in Treaty

[United Press, Brussels, 6th] It is claimed here that the five nations of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg agreed on the 6th to sign a treaty of economic and political cooperation, and other Western European countries will be invited to participate. Contrary to some speculation, the treaty does not include military clauses. Observers believe the reason for the omission of military clauses may be to make the treaty more attractive to other potential participating countries, such as the Scandinavian nations. British Ambassador to Belgium, Renter, stated that the terms of the treaty were finalized in one session at the meeting in Brussels. It is generally regarded as the cornerstone of the Western European alliance advocated by British Foreign Secretary Bevin to prevent the westward advance of communism. The speed with which this treaty was completed has broken diplomatic history records, mainly because all countries urgently want to present this treaty to the sixteen-nation conference opening in Paris on the 15th of this month. Renter also said that all countries participating in the Marshall Plan will receive invitations to participate in this treaty.

[United Press, Brussels, 6th] French representative Mably stated that all countries except totalitarian states may participate in this treaty, clearly indicating that Franco cannot participate for the time being. The five-nation European conference on the 6th proceeded in an optimistic and harmonious atmosphere, a situation rarely seen in recent international conferences. Under a clear blue sky and warm spring sunshine, the representatives chatted and laughed as they walked through the garden of the Belgian Foreign Ministry, presenting a scene of joy as they sat around the round table.

[Reuters, Brussels, 5th] British Foreign Office Assistant Jeb and French Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Chauvel, delayed by heavy snow, only arrived in Brussels today with the final draft of the Western European Alliance Treaty drafted by Britain and France. The two will formally present it when the representatives of the five countries reconvene on the 6th. The content of the final draft prepared by Britain and France has not yet been announced, but according to sources close to the British and French delegations, an agreement should not be difficult to reach between the British and French drafts and the suggestions of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. It is said that the provisions of the British and French drafts are much more detailed than the suggestions of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.

### Three Powers Agree on Unified Economy for West Germany; International Control of Ruhr Area; London Conference Declares End Yesterday

[United Press, London, 6th] The three-power West German conference of the United States, Britain, and France, lasting two weeks, declared its adjournment today and issued a communiqué stating that agreement had been reached on international co-management of the Ruhr area and close cooperation in registering West German assets for inclusion in the Marshall Plan. According to spokespersons for Britain and the United States, "good progress" has been made on the German production increase plan. Most of the resolutions have been returned to the respective capitals for review and will then be announced, which is expected to have a significant impact on the sixteen-nation conference to be held in Paris on the 15th of this month.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 5th] The conference of Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg to discuss the future status of West Germany effectively concluded today. The conference agreed on the federal nature of Germany, the future internationalization of the Ruhr area, and the unification of economic policies in the three occupation zones of West Germany.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 5th] The protest lodged by Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Poland regarding the London West German issue conference was rejected by the United States today. The State Department has delivered a note to the diplomatic representatives of the three countries here. The note reads as follows: "Your note of February 23, 1948, forwarding the content of the declaration on the German issue drafted by the foreign ministers of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia at the recent Prague conference, is acknowledged. I hereby inform you that this resolution contains many statements that are inconsistent with the facts, and discussing its content will not be helpful."

### Romania's New Constitution to be Submitted to Parliament for Discussion Next Month

[United Press, Bucharest, 6th] It was learned today that Romania's new constitution is scheduled to be submitted to Parliament for discussion on April 6. After the constitution is passed by Parliament, it will no longer be a special parliament but a regular parliament, continuing for four years. According to the new constitution, all natural resources should be nationalized, and foreign political prisoners may be granted refuge for democratic activities. Except for fascist groups, people shall have freedom of language, religion, education, speech, and writing. Church schools will be banned. Some observers believe that if the new constitution is passed, the management rights of British and American oil fields in Romania will come to an end.

### Soviet-British Agreement Aids Marshall Plan, US House Committee Opinion

[Reuters, Washington, 5th] The report submitted today by the House Select Committee on Foreign Aid stated that the Soviet Union, through its British-Soviet trade agreement, helps to improve the position of Britain, and therefore also helps the recovery of Europe, which is a supply for the Marshall Plan. The large inflow of Soviet grain into the world market helps world recovery and can therefore reduce the burden on the United States.

### Taft Opposes Establishing "Super Council"

[United Press, Washington, 5th] Senator Taft stated on the 5th that he opposes the suggestion of establishing a "Super Council" outside the United Nations to deal with aggression with armed forces.

### After the Czech Coup, President is Isolated; Gottwald Claims Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 6th] Former Czech Party newspaper editor Pangrli and member of the Czech People's Foreign Policy Committee, Hafa, stated here today that President Beneš should not be called the head of state, but a prisoner, and that he is completely isolated from the outside world.

[Reuters, Moscow, 5th] TASS reported that President Gottwald met with reporters from the Polish Workers' Daily and stated that Czech foreign policy will continue unchanged. The only difference is that reactionary elements no longer have the opportunity to interfere with Czech foreign policy, and reactionary elements will no longer be able to use Czech territory to launch conspiracies against other People's Democracies in Central and Eastern Europe.

### Finnish President Drafts Reply to Soviet Union, Prepares for Treaty Negotiations, Unwilling to Conclude Any Military Alliance

[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 7th Broadcast: Finnish capital broadcast stated that the leader of the Finnish Social Democratic Party declared that the Communist Party's attempt to instigate workers to force the government to conclude a military alliance with the Soviet Union has been defeated by the party. The opinions of most workers are consistent with the Finnish Parliament, refusing to conclude a military alliance with the Soviet Union.

[United Press, Helsinki, 5th] Finnish President Paasikivi began drafting a reply today to Stalin's request to conclude a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance. Foreign Minister Enckell and other important cabinet members are in busy consultation with the President. According to well-informed sources, the Finnish delegation will soon depart for Moscow.

The government will now accelerate its efforts to preempt demonstrations orchestrated by the Communist Party.

[United Press, Helsinki, 6th] The Finnish Parliament on the 6th voted in favor of starting treaty negotiations with the Soviet Union, but opposed concluding any military alliance with far-reaching implications. Among the six groups in Parliament, only the People's Front group, dominated by the Communist Party, supported concluding a military alliance with the Soviet Union. This group occupies fifty-one seats in the two hundred-seat parliament. Premier Stalin has requested to conclude a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance with Finland. If the mutual assistance clause is deleted from this treaty, it will only be a cultural and friendship agreement.

### President Truman Presides Over Cabinet Meeting, Discussing Major U.S. Policies, Will Take Diplomatic Initiative to Deal with Eastern European Events

[United Press, Washington, 5th] President Truman returned to Washington today after his vacation to deal with major policy decisions, namely whether the United States should conclude a military alliance with Western Europe to resist the Soviet Union. The President is scheduled to convene a cabinet meeting this afternoon, but it has not been announced whether this issue will be on the agenda. However, if the five Western European countries can agree on a mutual defense treaty and propose U.S. participation, then U.S. policy may be decided by the weekend.

At the same time, the urgent situation in Italy must also be taken into account. U.S. officials generally believe that Italy this spring will be the target of Soviet expansion of communist influence west of the Iron Curtain. The issue of military aid to Western Europe has been under informal discussion for several months. Baruch, a veteran politician and financier, proposed to Congress several weeks ago the idea of a military alliance between the United States and the countries participating in the Marshall Plan.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] According to political figures in Washington, recent events such as the coup in Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union's proposal to Finland to conclude an alliance have had a significant impact on the international situation. The U.S. government will soon take a diplomatic initiative to deal with these changes. According to well-informed sources, after taking the diplomatic initiative, a suggestive and clear warning will be issued to the Soviet Union, telling them that the recent events in Czechoslovakia are extremely noteworthy, and if this policy is promoted to other countries, the U.S. government will be forced to change its current attitude and take other effective steps to deal with it. After President Truman returns from Florida, he plans to consult with government cabinet members this afternoon, at which time the general principles of this diplomatic initiative can be decided.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 6th] After the Security Council passed a resolution yesterday authorizing the five powers to consult on the Palestine issue and submit a report within ten days, the first meeting of the five powers was held at 4:00 p.m. today at the new office of the Soviet delegation on Park Avenue. Britain does not plan to participate in this meeting, nor does it plan to participate in the discussion of substantive issues regarding Palestine, but will allocate one representative for other strong representatives to consult. China, one of the five powers, opposes partition, and France has not fully supported the partition plan, so the focus of the discussion should be on U.S. Representative Austin and Soviet Representative Gromyko.

### Arab Troops Leave Damascus, Establish Headquarters, Prepare for Anti-Jewish War

[United Press, Damascus, 5th] General Commander of the Arab Anti-Partition Army, Kaukji, led his column into Palestine on the 5th, established headquarters, and organized troops to fight for the Holy Land. As Kaukji's troops crossed the Syrian border, Arab troops occupying the mountains in Palestine launched diversionary attacks on Jews to attract the main force of the British army. Kaukji established his headquarters in a village at the foot of a small mountain, where he commanded the people's resistance against the British in 1931.

### Ashida's Cabinet Formation Work Stalled; Ashida Plans to Invite Katayama for a Fourth Time Today

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] Ashida's cabinet formation work has temporarily stalled due to Katayama's refusal to join the cabinet.

[Further Dispatch] The Democratic Party convened a cadre meeting at 3:00 p.m. on the 6th and decided that Prime Minister Ashida would visit Katayama again on the morning of the 7th to invite him to join the cabinet for the fourth time.

### Roxas Decides to Fully Suppress Farmer Army Rebellion on Philippine Islands; Said Army is Colluding with Foreign Country

[United Press Asia Deputy President Vaughn, Manila, 6th] Philippine President Roxas convened an emergency press conference on the 6th to announce the launch of a full-scale campaign to suppress the Hukbalahap (armed peasant rebels) and the National Peasants Union. The two parties are planning to overthrow the government by relying on the aggression of a certain foreign country (probably the Soviet Union). Roxas said he could not prove direct contact between the unlawful entity and Moscow unless it was through the Chinese Communist Party.

[United Press, Manila, 6th] President Roxas announced at a special press conference today that the Farmer's Army and the National Peasants Union are illegal organizations, and stated that the Farmer's Army totals 2,000 people and the Labor-Peasant Alliance totals 50,000 people, all of which are communist organizations. The President also displayed secret documents showing the collusion of the two groups with world communism. These documents were captured by government troops and police during the war with the Farmer's Army and included various hand-written orders from Castillo, chairman of the Peasants Union, requesting members to find ways to assassinate Roxas.

Conditional Application of Unconditional Surrender

The principle of unconditional surrender overshadowed our policies towards the Axis and its satellite states, and our plans for their future.

This principle was not originally conceived by the State Department. We were shocked when Generalissimo announced this principle for the first time in front of the British Prime Minister at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, as was Churchill. I was told that Churchill was dismayed and speechless at the time.

Like many of my colleagues, I fundamentally opposed this principle for two reasons. One reason was that this principle might cause the Axis powers to fight to the death, resisting desperately and prolonging the war.

President himself explained the meaning of unconditional surrender at Casablanca, saying that it was not about destroying the people of Germany, Japan, and Italy, but about ending a theory based on conquering other nations. However, the phrase itself spread more widely than the explanation, becoming a tool in the hands of Nazi propagandists.

The second reason was that this principle logically required the victorious nations to prepare to take over every department of the national and local governments of the conquered countries, and to handle all governmental activities and undertakings. We and our allies were not prepared to undertake such a great obligation.

We in the State Department had begun discussing post-war issues more than three years before the Casablanca Conference, but we had not considered the idea of unconditional surrender. However, after the President explained this principle at Casablanca, we had no choice but to follow it, at least formally.

At the end of December 1943, the British Embassy delivered a memorandum, informing us that peace feelers had reached the British government through Sweden from a high-ranking official of the German Foreign Ministry and Himmler, the chief of Hitler's police. The nature of these feelers was a statement that Himmler was prepared to send an army officer and a Nazi party member to meet with British representatives to learn the definition of the term "unconditional surrender." The British informed us that their plan was to simply reply that the United Nations demanded Germany's unconditional surrender, without further explanation. We agreed to such a reply.

On December 31, when Molotov and Ambassador Harriman spoke, the Soviet Union also raised the issue of unconditional surrender with us. Therefore, after discussing with my colleagues, I submitted a memorandum to the President on January 14, 1944, reporting to him that Molotov had voluntarily mentioned the definition of the phrase "unconditional surrender" to Harriman and inquired about the attitude of our government.

I said: "As far as I know, the Soviet government believes that a definition of surrender terms imposed on the enemy, no matter how broad and severe, is sufficient to deprive the enemy of propaganda benefits, thereby weakening the morale of their army and people. In view of the Soviet Union's concern about this issue, would you allow us to discuss with the governments of the Soviet Union and Great Britain whether to add a public definition to the terms of unconditional surrender imposed on each enemy country, for propaganda purposes?"

Three days later, on January 17, the President replied to me with a memorandum, starting with:

"Frankly, I don't like the idea of discussing the definition of 'unconditional surrender.' The Soviet Union, Great Britain, and the United States have agreed never to make any peace without consulting each other. I believe that everything should be decided in accordance with this principle."

Then he continued:

"The German people must have heard what I said in my Christmas night speech. In fact, we do not intend to destroy the German people. We want them to live for generations, like other people in Europe, but on one condition: that they must eliminate their current idea of conquest. I can't completely remember what I said at the time, but you can check it.

"Second, the German people and the Soviet Union should also understand what the true meaning of 'unconditional surrender' is. (During the American Civil War) Lee's surrender to Grant is a good illustration. Lee wanted to talk about various conditions. Grant stated: Lee must submit to [Grant's] fairness. So Lee surrendered. Lee immediately raised the issue of the warhorses of the Confederate officers, most of which belonged to them personally. Grant told Lee that they should take the warhorses home for spring plowing, and the matter was resolved.

(The President had a broad knowledge of American history, and he had done in-depth research. But Grant demanded unconditional surrender not at Appomattox, but at Fort Donelson in 1862, when he accepted the surrender of General Buckner.)

The President concluded: "Such small things as mentioned above have a greater effect on the Germans than the many talks held by the Soviets, British, and ourselves to explain 'unconditional surrender.' No matter what words we agree on, once a country wants to surrender, it will probably have to be modified or changed."

On January 25, I informed Ambassador Harriman in Moscow of the main points of this memorandum.

A few weeks later, when the Soviets and Finns discussed peace negotiations, the Russians themselves revised the principle of unconditional surrender.

Foreign Secretary Eden used the Soviet approach to Finland as the basis for a suggestion to us, suggesting that the principle of unconditional surrender be softened for the smaller Axis countries. On March 20, 1944, British Ambassador Halifax handed me a telegram from Eden, containing the above-mentioned information. The date of the telegram was March 17, 1944.

Five days later, I suggested to the President that we should follow the method proposed by the British in order to obtain greater flexibility for the Axis satellite states.

While I was waiting for the President's response to this suggestion, I received a memorandum from Soviet Ambassador Gromyko, stating that his government agreed with the position taken by the British government and the State Department: that the principle of unconditional surrender should be revised.

Before I had a chance to deliver this memorandum to the President, I received his reply to my suggestion of March 25.

He said, "I think this matter should be handled differently. In my judgment, to abandon the words 'unconditional surrender' or make exceptions to it would be a mistake. In fact, to whom do we intend to apply these words? Obviously, our enemies.

"When the Atlantic Charter was established in August 1941 and the Casablanca Conference was held in January 1943, the Axis satellite states were Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and Finland. Although they are also our enemies, they are different in meaning from Germany and Italy. These four small satellite states became our enemies under German-Italian coercion.

"I think it is a mistake to make exceptions. Italy surrendered unconditionally but received many special rights at the same time. The same should happen if Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, or Finland surrender. Lee surrendered unconditionally to Grant, but Grant immediately told him that his officers should take their warhorses home for spring plowing. This is the spirit I want to see overseas, but this spirit does not apply to Germany. Germany only understands one language. Roosevelt."

After receiving the President's reply, several of my colleagues suggested to me in a memorandum that I raise this issue with Roosevelt again. After some discussion, I sent a letter to the President on April 4.

At this time, the President was lying in bed in the White House, suffering from severe bronchitis, and I could not talk to him in person. Therefore, there was a series of written conversations.

The President replied the next day. He said, "I fully understand this issue, but I must prevent people from saying that the principle of unconditional surrender has been abandoned at all costs. If we start making exceptions to the general principle before a special situation occurs, then there will be real danger in it.

"We all know that this danger will inevitably occur if we make any exceptions to the principles that will be applied in all situations in the future.

"I fully understand that there will inevitably be exceptions later, not exceptions to the principle of surrender, but exceptions to the application of the principle of surrender in special circumstances - this is completely different from changing the principle.

"If the Soviet and British governments notify me of such a situation, then I am sure we will agree with them. This should be explained to these two governments. At that time, they cannot accuse us of making the Soviet military mission more difficult. Roosevelt."

But this issue would not die down. Just two days later, from another aspect, namely the military aspect, the issue was raised again. On April 13, 1944, I received a telegram from Under Secretary of State Stettinius, who was then in London, forwarding to me the suggestions made to him by General Eisenhower and General Smith, Eisenhower's Chief of Staff. Stettinius said that these two generals had raised this issue with him and expressed their cautious opinions, believing that we should announce the principles of how the defeated German army would be treated after surrendering, in order to clarify the meaning of unconditional surrender.

I sent this telegram to the President, who was resting at Baruch Plantation in Georgetown, South Carolina, due to a minor illness.

On April 15, I received a short message from the President, mentioning Stettinius' telegram of April 13 and saying: "Any reply to this telegram must be sent out only after my approval."

On April 17, I telegraphed Philipp, asking him to inform everyone concerned that the President hoped that this issue would not be given further consideration without his consent.

The President returned to Washington on May 7. Three days later, I sent a memorandum on this issue to the President. I said: The State Department has received a notification from the British Embassy, stating that the British government believes it is very important for the Allies to carry out propaganda against the satellite states. This propaganda, especially against Hungary and Bulgaria, should henceforth delete the term "unconditional surrender" in order to obtain the maximum military benefits in strengthening the resistance against Germany. There will be no abandonment of the general principle.

I said, "In making this suggestion, the British Embassy pointed out that the Soviet government did not apply this principle to Finland, and if Romania ceased fire according to their surrender proposal, then the Soviet government could also not apply this principle to Romania. It is generally assumed that propaganda agencies will consider these issues when preparing their instructions. Regarding Hungary and Bulgaria, the State Department believes that it would be beneficial to take vigorous action on propaganda at this time. Therefore, I would be grateful if you would indicate whether you will allow us to take parallel actions with the British and Soviets, granting some freedom of action for propaganda."

The President sent the memorandum back to me, with the words "OK" written on it.

The repeated statements issued by the leaders of the three major Allied powers softened the interpretation of unconditional surrender, but did not lead to Germany's early surrender. The Nazi propaganda machine continued to the end, emphasizing its rigid interpretation of unconditional surrender.

Whether Germany would have surrendered sooner if the principle of unconditional surrender had not been announced, or if the conditions agreed upon and declared by the United Nations had been more lenient, remains a question.

In any case, continuing to apply unconditional surrender to Germany did have this effect: that future German propaganda agencies could never again claim, as they did in the 1920s and 1930s, that the German army was not defeated, and that Germany's defeat was due to the weakness of the rear civil administration and the people.

As for our eastern enemy, Japan, she surrendered three months later, when she saw that the principle of unconditional surrender could be applied conditionally. (End)

### The Municipal Assembly Concluded Last Night. The Multiple of Rent Was Determined and Passed. It Will Be Implemented This Month Based on 7,000 Times and 9,000 Times the 26th Year of the Republic of China. Adjusted Every Six Months.

[Reported by this newspaper] The 5th session of the first Municipal Assembly was held for a total of twelve days. After holding the tenth and eleventh meetings separately yesterday morning and afternoon, it came to a satisfactory conclusion at 9:30 pm. Among the proposals of greatest concern to citizens in this meeting, in addition to the decision to cancel the electricity saving fine which was resolved a few days ago, the rent issue was also discussed in the assembly yesterday, and a solution was reached after an hour and a half. Several points were decided: (1) The Municipal Assembly decided that a maximum rent should be set. (2) The maximum amount is: the rent for commercial properties should be increased by 9,000 times compared to the 26th year of the Republic of China, and the rent for residential properties should be increased by 7,000 times. (3) The above measures will be implemented from this month and adjusted every six months. (4) The rent for public education personnel will no longer be calculated at 80% of the rate, but will be handled in accordance with the newly set amount. After the rent issue was decided, the housing tax could also be resolved. It was resolved that: (1) The housing tax will be collected from the landlord based on the actual rent received. (2) The tax rate will still be collected at the original maximum tax rate, 5% of the rent for residential use and 10% for commercial use.

According to the above-mentioned maximum rent, it was set by Vice Chairman Xu based on the previously set 180 times and 140 times the rent, plus 50 times, that is, 9,000 times and 7,000 times the rent in the 26th year of the Republic of China. In other words, a commercial property that cost 10 yuan before the war now costs 90,000 yuan, and a residential property now costs 70,000 yuan. During the discussion, none of the participating assembly members agreed to set the standard "according to the cost of living index," but most agreed that a standard should be set. Feng Youzhen and He Chengfu fundamentally did not advocate setting a rent standard. Li Wenjie, Jiang Pingfan, Zhu Wende, Ma Shaoji, Wang Wei, etc. stated that according to the Housing Lease Regulations, this case should be sent back to the Municipal Government, because the Municipal Government sent it to the Municipal Assembly for agreement. If the Municipal Assembly does not agree, it will be sent back for revision, and the Municipal Assembly has no right to set the standard. However, most assembly members believed that they had the right to set it. At the same time, the term "standard" was unreasonable. After inquiring with Director Zhu, he also replied that "standard" was a mistake for "maximum amount." Many assembly members agreed to set a maximum amount, but each person proposed a different multiple. Zhang Zhongyuan advocated 4,000 to 8,000 times, Shi Zongde advocated 5,000 to 15,000 times, and for pre-war rents of less than 10 yuan, 3,000 to 6,000 times, Xi Xiading 3,500 times. Feng Youzhen and Fei Shusheng advocated freezing the rent according to the rent in January, and Jiang Haoran advocated freezing the rent according to the rent in December. Mayor Wu immediately suggested organizing a committee to discuss after the closing of the meeting, and it is especially necessary to formulate a method to sanction unreasonable profiteering by secondary landlords, but this was not agreed to by the Assembly. As a result, people such as Tao Baichuan and Yang Gongshu all agreed with the opinion of the Vice Chairman, and it was passed after a vote.

### A Round of Applause. Support for Zhu Ping. The Warning Case Was Immediately Withdrawn.

[This newspaper] After the rent issue was decided in the Assembly yesterday, Zhu Ping, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, formally expressed his agreement and said that it could be submitted by the Municipal Government. He also said that the decision would be strictly implemented in the future. If there are difficulties in implementation, the court can preside over it. If it still cannot be done well, then he is willing to ask for punishment (the assembly members present applauded enthusiastically and repeatedly). The original proposal by Assemblyman Tang Shichang and others, to "warn Zhu Ping, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, who disregards the interests of the public, by this Assembly," immediately declared its withdrawal, and some assembly members requested that the withdrawal be changed to support, causing a burst of laughter. The warning case was then decided to be withdrawn.

### Various Tax Rates Were Amended and Approved. The Municipal Construction Donation for Automobiles Will Increase in the Second Half of the Year. Scientific Organizations' Own Production Is Exempt from Taxes.

Finance Part: (1) Regarding the detailed rules for six types of tax revenue: banquets, entertainment, slaughter, business licenses, use licenses, and housing donations, the Mayor submitted them for discussion and requested the Assembly to approve their implementation. Among them, the detailed rules for collection were fully passed by the Assembly based on the revision opinions of the special regulations committee. The tax rates for each tax were discussed and slightly amended by the Assembly before being passed. The resolutions are as follows: (1) Banquet tax - remains at the original tax rate of 15%. (2) Entertainment tax - remains at the original tax rate, i.e., 20% for dramas and 25% for all others. (3) Slaughter tax - remains at the original tax rate of 5%. (4) Business license tax - remains at the original tax rate until the case of submitting a request to the central government for revocation is approved, with a maximum of 3‰. (5) Use license tax - passed according to the amendment proposed by the Finance Bureau (i.e., vehicle taxation by grade). (6) Housing donation (see above).

(2) Business tax, there is a case "The business tax rate is doubled, and merchants are unable to bear it. Please earnestly forward the case to the central government to maintain the old tax rate for taxation." Solution: 1. Telegraph to the central government to revise the business tax law again to restore the original tax rate of 1.5% and 4%. 2. Consult the Municipal Government and order the Finance Bureau to temporarily collect the business tax rate for the 37th year of the Republic of China at the original tax rate. Resolution passed.

(3) The Mayor submitted a case "Intending to adjust the donation amount for the municipal construction of automobiles." Resolution: It is proposed that the Assembly pass the case as it is, that is, increase it by two times starting in the second half of the year, with a total annual amount of 64.8 billion. A letter will also be sent to the Engineering and Social Affairs Bureaus to explain in detail the use of the donation in the second half of the 36th year of the Republic of China. Also, starting from this year, the use of the donation will be determined as three-quarters for engineering affairs and one-quarter for social affairs.

(4) A letter was sent to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Finance to tentatively reorganize the Shanghai Municipal Bank with reference to the organizational regulations of the Provincial Bank before the central government promulgates the organizational regulations for the Municipal Bank under the jurisdiction of the Central Government.

(5) "The local real estate tax should be waived for scientific organizations' own houses and properties." Resolution: Handled according to the preferential treatment example for charitable organizations' houses. Also, a temporary proposal "It is proposed to forward to the Central Government to order the Municipal Government to order the Finance Bureau to revoke the annual business license tax to avoid duplicate collection and alleviate the difficulties of Jiangsu merchants." Resolution: Passed.

Also, the Mayor submitted a case "Based on the report of the Finance Bureau, it is proposed to discuss the outline of the simplified collection of business tax in Shanghai." Resolution: Passed in principle. The Municipal Government, the Municipal Assembly, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce shall each appoint responsible representatives to form a committee to formulate implementation measures, submit them to the central government for record, and implement them on a trial basis on a regular basis.

### Manure Can Only Be Dumped During Limited Hours. Garbage Is Transferred to Fertilizer.

Health Part: (1) "Please stipulate the time for dumping manure to emphasize sanitation, and stipulate the monthly collection fee to avoid disturbing citizens." Resolution: A letter shall be sent to the Municipal Government to order the Health Bureau to urge its subordinates to complete the dumping within the originally stipulated time and pay attention to the extra demands of the manure collectors. (2) "It is proposed to suggest that the Health Bureau set up garbage dumping stations in the far suburbs so that waste can be utilized and transferred to farmland fertilizer." Resolution: A letter shall be sent to the Municipal Government to order the Health Bureau to implement it conscientiously. (3) "The locations in various small vegetable markets in the city are mostly occupied by small shops. It is proposed that the Health Bureau ban them to match the name with reality and submit it for public decision." Resolution: This case is sent to the Health Bureau for conscientious implementation of the market management regulations. (4) "It is proposed to suggest that the Health Bureau change the Grade C health center in Xinjing District to Grade B and quickly set up branches in important towns to facilitate medical treatment for patients and lying-in women." Resolution: It is suggested that the Health Bureau increase the number of medical personnel at its discretion according to the progress of the Health Affairs Office. The principle is to transfer them. (5) "It is proposed to establish health work in schools in this city and submit it for public decision." Resolution: 1. Passed in principle, a letter shall be sent to the Municipal Government for reference. 2. The Fourth General Assembly of School Health has already passed a resolution, please implement it conscientiously. (6) "Clean up the alleys and eliminate the epidemic."

Resolution: (1) All four items are passed in principle. (2) The Assembly authorizes the Urban Planning Review Committee and the Public Works Committee of the Assembly to immediately and carefully study this case together with the review opinions. Under the principle of taking into account the actual difficulties of small and medium-sized factories and reducing losses, a decision shall be made at its discretion.

Also, the Speaker submitted the Municipal Government's letter sending the West Zhabei District Zoning Plan Map and explanation, and the West Zhabei District Construction Area Zoning Rules, proposing to expand the planning scope and revise the road system to cooperate and facilitate implementation, please check and review. Resolution: 1. This plan is passed in principle. 2. For the implementation of this plan, the Municipal Government should be requested to use the land requisition method to implement the plan in stages, and the original landowners have the right to prioritize.

### Salary of Public and Educational Personnel - Please Expedite Improvements

Regarding the cases of "The soaring prices in this city make it difficult for public and educational personnel to maintain a living, please find ways to provide relief" and the ad hoc motion "Prices in Shanghai are constantly changing, it is proposed that the municipal government appropriately increase the salaries of public and educational personnel," both were combined for discussion and resolved: This council is deeply concerned about the meager salaries and difficult living conditions of public and educational personnel in this city. This case is approved in principle and sent to the municipal government to promptly find sources of funding and improve salaries as much as possible. It was further resolved to approve the organization of a "Resolution Review Committee" to review the implementation of resolutions from the previous four general meetings, and to suggest that the Executive Yuan order the Materials Supply Bureau to quickly dispose of surplus materials and abolish the bureau within a time limit.

Increasing Education Funding

In addition, the more important proposals included: (1) The Speaker submitted a proposal to approve the letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce regarding the police department's order to dismantle neon lights within six months, requesting correction and prevention. It was resolved that neon lights running parallel to traffic lights at intersections should change their colors, while all others should remain as they are. (2) A proposal to increase the city's education funding to 35% of the total municipal budget to comply with the constitution and benefit education. It was resolved that it be approved in principle and sent to the municipal government to increase the percentage of education funding as much as possible when preparing the next fiscal year's budget and to gradually realize the 35% ratio stipulated by the constitution. (3) The Speaker submitted a proposal to approve the telegram from the preparatory committee of the National Grain Federation, requesting exemption from grain business tax. It was resolved to recommend that the government exempt it. (4) Regarding the general budget of revenue and expenditure of Shanghai City for the 37th year, the conveners of the Budget and Final Accounts Committee, Xu Yongzuo, He Yuanming, and Li Wenjie, submitted a written report and proposed the capacity to review budgets and additional expenditures in the future, which was approved by the General Assembly. As for the security police, it was decided to temporarily increase the number by 1,000. The mounted patrol team should also be included in this 1,000 as much as possible. In addition, regarding the initiation of a large-scale fundraising campaign to assist the United Nations in soliciting donations for child relief, the municipal government is requested to handle it appropriately.

### Two City Councilors - A Dispute

[Our report] Yesterday, before the Shanghai City Council meeting in the morning, councilors Qu Yue and Zhong Yuliang suddenly had a verbal conflict, almost leading to physical violence. Fortunately, the speaker and deputy speaker intervened, preventing the escalation of the situation. Recently, 2,000 residents of Gaoqiao District jointly requested the removal of Qu. Qu had already published a statement in various newspapers the day before yesterday. Yesterday, when he met Zhong Yuliang, the head of Gaoqiao District, he asked, "The residents of Gaoqiao District are recalling me. You are the district head. Why didn't you tell me earlier?" Zhong replied, "I think you are not doing a good job as a councilor, so they want to recall you." Upon hearing this, Qu became even more angry. Zhong then loudly said, "Please maintain order in the meeting place!" Qu said, "The meeting hasn't started yet, this is not the meeting place." The two sides were at odds. Qu Yue rushed forward and said, "I have now changed to Yangjing District. The residents of Gaoqiao District cannot recall me." Zhong also refused to back down, saying, "We insist on recalling you, so what?" At this time, the speaker and others were nearby and intervened to mediate, and the dispute was finally resolved.

### Zhao Zengjue Expresses Weariness - Mayor Wu Earnestly Urges Him to Stay

Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, has repeatedly submitted his resignation to Mayor Wu due to the difficult times and difficult measures, feeling exhausted and wanting to give way to others. Mayor Wu believes that Zhao has been in charge of the city's public works for more than two years, working hard and actively promoting progress with great success. In addition to repeatedly approving and urging him to stay, he has also earnestly urged him to remain in his position.

### Request to the U.S. Government - Implement Full-Scale Aid to China - Translated Telegram to Be Sent This Morning

[Our report] The telegram to the U.S. government, decided by the City Council the day before yesterday, requesting full-scale aid to China, has been translated into English and will be sent out this morning. The original telegram reads: "President Truman of the United States, Secretary of State Marshall, Speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives, and Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Appropriations Committee, and Military Committee: The Chinese government's efforts to contain the spread of communist rebels are a war to maintain international justice and world peace, and are unavoidable for safeguarding China's independence and freedom. Only an independent, free, peaceful, and unified China standing tall in the Far East, not swept away by totalitarian communism, can ensure that the peace and happiness of the world's people and the democratic and free way of life on both sides of the Pacific Ocean are spared from destruction. However, since the Chinese government and people endured a long war of resistance against Japan, the national strength is exhausted, and the people's livelihood is impoverished. We are currently in a serious situation and cannot but hope for your country's urgent assistance. The current problem in China, as stated by General MacArthur and General Wedemeyer, is indeed only a military problem. Therefore, your country must strengthen military assistance in addition to economic aid to China in order to be effective. If the ammunition, food, clothing, and other supplies necessary for the Chinese communist suppression troops can be continuously provided by your country without affecting the country's regular budget, we dare to believe that not only can the suppression of communist forces in China be completed sooner, but also the trend of inflation can be stopped, and it will not be difficult for the national economy to recover its balance. At the same time, we must give full play to public opinion and supervise the government to promote the active implementation of domestic reforms in coordination with your country's aid to China. Saving the sick and fighting fire must be timely. If the medicine is not right or the water power is insufficient, it will not be enough to relieve the difficulties of those waiting to be rescued. China is currently in urgent need of your country's military and economic assistance, just as described above. This council hereby makes a sincere appeal to your country on behalf of the five million citizens of Shanghai. Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai City Council; Xu Jiyin, Deputy Speaker; March 6."

Mayor Visits Rice Shops in Various Districts to Inspect Rice Quality. (Photo by this newspaper)

### Mayor's Inspection Tour - Caring for People's Food - Inquiring About Rice Distribution in Various Districts - Praising Yangshupu District for Excellent Performance

[Our report] Mayor Wu attaches great importance to the city-wide rice distribution. Yesterday morning, he went to various districts for inspection accompanied by Ren Xianqun, Director of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, and the Director of the News Department. Starting at 8:30 a.m. from the Mayor's residence, he first went to the Jing'an District Office. District Chief Jin Dehuan reported that all the certificates for the first half of the month had been distributed, and the receipt books were verified to be correct.

### Knocking on Doors to Visit Residents - Housewife Was Getting Ready - Repeatedly Said "Sorry"

Accompanied by District Chief Jin, he went to No. 12 Bao, Zhaojiaqiao Road, Changde Road, and inquired from Yu Weichang's official residence, Zengfang, Yichang Meat Shop, and others. Many residents said they had received the rice purchase permits. The Mayor asked them to show the distributed rice after seeing it, and asked, "Is the rice quality good?" The distributed rice was white and solid, and the residents replied, "Good." Then he went to Xieda Public Rice Shop on Changde Road to inquire about the distribution of rice. He also knocked on the door of resident No. 281 and asked if they had received the distribution certificate. The housewife was just getting up to get ready. The Mayor said, "Sorry." After inquiring and confirming that they had also received the distribution certificate, he urged them to go to the rice shop to buy rice with the certificate before the 12th.

### Shuttle Visit on Main Road

The group then went to the Laozha District Office, accompanied by District Chief Li Ruchun. They first went to the New World Company, but the company was not yet open for business. So they crossed to the opposite Jiu Feng Silk Shop to inquire, and were told that they had received the distribution certificate. The manager of the silk shop, seeing the Mayor personally investigating, repeatedly praised him for "diligence in government and love for the people" and "wise Mayor". Then they went to the neighboring Shengxifu Hat Factory and Shurenyu Chinese Medicine Shop to inquire. These two households had not yet received the distribution certificate. The Mayor urged them to urge the Bao Chief to get it quickly. Then they crossed the road in Renjin Middle Road to the opposite Taikang Biscuit Company and Daguangming Clock and Glasses General Store to inquire, and all had received the distribution certificate. Then they walked from Lloyd Road to Xizang Road to check the distribution situation of Tongchang Rice. At that time, citizens buying rice with special certificates were very enthusiastic in front of the door. The Mayor verified that the displayed rice samples were the same as the rice sold to the citizens, and then left happily. He drove straight to the old city center, Xinxin Street, where District Chief Cai Fushan reported that the purchase certificates had been issued to 52% of the residents and accompanied him to Yangjiabang Town on Mayushan Road to inspect. The Mayor inquired from the residents one by one.

### Rice Sold Out - Mayor Satisfied

Then he went to Yangshupu District. The rice distribution situation in this district was the best. All the distribution certificates had been issued, and most of the rice shops had the words "Rice Sold Out, More Will Be Sold Later" written in front of their doors. The Mayor was satisfied with the district and repeatedly praised it. Later, after hearing that many residents of Tilanqiao District had not received the distribution certificates, he drove to the district office to investigate. After checking the books, he saw that the Bao Chiefs had taken the purchase certificates in many ways, and five Baos had not received the certificates at all. Mayor Wu repeatedly urged the staff of the district office to treat this matter as the most important thing and to pay attention to it in the future and not to neglect it. He also went to the Jiang Qiaoxing Longevity Shop in the First Bao Office of the district to inspect and instructed the Bao Chief to issue the certificates quickly.

### Hoping Citizens - Openly Review

It was 11:45 at this point, and because he had to attend the City Council meeting, he ended the inspection. Mayor Wu said: The distribution of rice in March was done for the first time, and difficulties and shortcomings were unavoidable. He believed that the process would be greatly improved when it was done in April. He hoped that the district government investigation team decided by the City Council would be established soon and go to various districts to supervise rice distribution. All colleagues in the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Civil Food Allocation Committee should do their best to urge the Bao and Jia Chiefs near their residences, and hoped that citizens would openly review the process. He would also go to various districts for inspection with Mr. Jimeide, the head of the American China Relief Mission, to step up supervision.

According to the statement to reporters by Chairman Ren: The civil food allocation committee determined that the distribution certificate for the second half of the month would be issued to the district offices for distribution before the 8th.

### Short of More Than One Jin of Rice - Thorough Investigation of Embezzlement

[Our report] The No. 2 and No. 8 groups of the Laisai District, which belong to the South Rice Market and are responsible for selling rice allocated by population, issued 3,549 bags of rice from the Taikoo Warehouse of the China Trust Bureau the day before yesterday, which were distributed to various rice shops for sale. It was found that each two bags were short of half a kilogram, totaling 1,744 kilograms. According to regulations, the rice transportation company is responsible for the compensation. Yesterday, the rice company appealed to the Civil Food Allocation Committee and sent personnel to negotiate with the food warehouse. The food warehouse believed that the goods had been weighed and left the warehouse, and the shortage was not pointed out at the time, so it did not admit it. It is reported that the authorities are paying great attention to this matter and have sent personnel to thoroughly investigate it. The China Trust Bureau will be requested to announce the figures of Taikoo's warehouse entry and exit, and will jointly open and lock the warehouse to check whether there is a surplus after the storage of rice is completed, in order to prove whether there is any embezzlement.

### Speaker's Closing Remarks - Praising the Spirit of the Assembly - Treating Matters, Not People, is the Foundation of Democratic Politics

[Our report] The closing ceremony of the Council was held last night. After the ceremony, Speaker Pan delivered the closing remarks, saying: During this meeting, everyone was able to discuss various important issues with all their efforts and achieved considerable results. Although some proposals were not properly handled due to the rush of time, everyone can be satisfied with their spirit. The maximum rent discussed at the last meeting has also been reasonably resolved. Although there may be difficulties in implementation in the future, it is believed that the government can do its best to implement it. In addition, the factory establishment address and zoning cases formulated by the municipal government are also very important and have a close relationship with urban progress and current industry. Therefore, they are specially submitted to the Urban Planning Committee and the Public Works Committee for review, which shows that we dare not neglect or make hasty decisions on cases related to citizens. In the public utilities sector, although public utilities have been criticized for repeated price increases, it is believed that this kind of criticism is directed at the matter and not at the person. The fact that the Land Administration Director finally understood a little about the rent issue can prove this. Therefore, the same is true for Director Zhao. The system of fines for exceeding the limit of electricity consumption was also cancelled due to the cooperation of the competent authorities. Although matters of this kind have not been completed to take care of the citizens, they can at least relieve or reduce some of the suffering of the citizens. In terms of public security, it was also possible to establish a garrison brigade under the current economic difficulties. There is no need to repeat the resolutions of other departments.

In short, I hope that everyone will always be able to encourage themselves with the spirit of this conference, that is, "to deal with things and not people." This is the foundation of true democratic politics. Criticize as much as possible during the discussion, and the other party should listen with generosity. When implementing, they must abandon personal prejudices and obey the decisions of the participants. I hope that this spirit will be promoted.

In terms of international affairs, this Council has sent a telegram to the American public and private sectors. The American public and private sectors have always valued the opinions of the Chinese people, and I believe that they will respect the opinions of this Council.

Mayor Wu Expresses Hope

Mayor Wu’s arrival speech said that being able to engage in public relations and criticism in the Council is the best phenomenon. Because of openness, criticism, and improvement, these three are the spirit of doing things. In the recent three months, the municipal government especially needs to make public the household registration rice allocation system. I inspected various districts this morning and was quite satisfied, but I still think that some places are slow to do things. Finally, the Mayor hoped that the Council would assist the municipal government and supervise the municipal government so that municipal administration would be satisfactory. At the same time, the colleagues of the municipal government are willing to follow the spirit of openness and criticism of everyone to achieve a model of democratic politics.

Tao Baichuan Feels Progress

Councilor Tao Baichuan delivered a speech on behalf of the Councilors, saying that the end of the five meetings made me feel that the Council is progressing more than the previous one. (1) The human resources have increased more than before. After the Councilors of the Youth Party joined, they jointly discussed proposals representing the interests of the people in the Council without participating in a political party position. This wise attitude is the success of this Council, and this Council has expanded its momentum and can better serve the people and assist the government. (2) This time, the questioning of the General Assembly used oral rather than written form, which is also a characteristic. (3) The Human Rights Protection Committee organized by this Council strives for the freedom, equality, and life protection of the people. This Council respects the personality of the military and police very much, because of deep love and expectation. (4) The rent problem was solved due to the motion of Deputy Speaker Xu. Although the interests of a small number of landlords are reduced, I hope they can consider protecting the interests of the majority of the people.

### Passed the Establishment of a Human Rights Protection Committee - Unanimous Indignation at Existing Facts - Economic Police Want to Arrest Councilors

Yesterday's General Assembly also passed the establishment of a Human Rights Protection Committee, and its actions are: (1) The councilors of this Council will jointly elect 11 people to form a Human Rights Protection Committee. (2) During the recess, they will be stationed to handle people's complaints and urge the administrative organs to legally transfer the arrested people. (3) If the people are arrested on suspicion and the authorities violate the constitution and fail to transfer them to the judiciary within the time limit, the victims are allowed to come to the meeting at any time to file a complaint and correct it immediately. The 11 members of the committee were elected as Li Wenjie, Chen Baotai, Qu Yue, Feng Youzhen, Hou Jiyuan, Jiang Huaixu, Xu Yongzuo, Zhao Junhao, Zhou Feicheng, Jiang Pingfan, and Zhang Zhongyuan. The Speaker, Deputy Speaker, and the supervisors elected by the Council are ex officio members.

When the case was discussed, Councilor Yu Rupin reported that yesterday afternoon, several economic policemen suddenly came to the South Goods Store opened by him, forcibly searched it, copied out two gold bracelets worn by his adult and the receipts issued by a friend for borrowing gold two years ago, and pointed them out as illegal evidence. Although Yu stated that he was a councilor and had to attend the meeting, the police insisted on arresting Yu. After notifying Director Yu by telegram, although the Director-General notified him to withdraw, the police still ignored it. Yu said that the police are like this to the councilors, and the average people cannot imagine it. He asked to uphold justice. At the same time, Speaker Pan also reported that after he received Yu's phone call, he called the police to go away in the phone and informed the other party that he was the Speaker of the Council, and had held the position ten times, and told him that, except for criminals caught in the act, the city councilors cannot be arrested or detained during the meeting without the permission of the City Council. The other party still claimed that they could not hear and did not know who the Speaker was. After reprimanding him and saying that he would sue to the Mayor for punishment, he left. All the Councilors in the hall were extremely indignant after hearing this and demanded that the Mayor investigate and punish severely. The Mayor immediately guaranteed to investigate and handle it.

Recently, the Pei Ji Bu Ge ship of the Dutch Zhawa Shipping Company arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong and berthed at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. The Jianghai Customs received a tip-off in advance that the ten pieces of luggage and furniture listed in the import manifest of the ship were suspected of smuggling private goods in the name of the embassy. Officials were dispatched to detain the ten large wooden boxes of luggage during unloading and jointly opened the boxes with the consignee of the goods, Ping Zhiming Yanghang, for inspection. A large number of valuable woolen fabrics, cigarettes, saccharin, and radio light bulbs were found inside, with an estimated total value of approximately 6-70 billion yuan. The case is currently under further investigation by the Jianghai Customs.

### Collusion with a Lawyer to Report Traitors - Blackmail for Huge Sums of Money

[Our report] Tang Songrong, the owner of Tianyi Dyeing and Weaving Factory, resides at No. 2, Lane 168, Wuxing Road, and has factories in Binlang Road and Xietu Road. Feng Zhen, 38 years old, from Yuyao, resides at his relative's home at No. 31, Lane 434, Beijing West Road. During the enemy puppet period, he worked for the Japanese company Takebayashi Yanghang and knew Tang. Feng had been unemployed for a long time and, knowing that Tang was wealthy, colluded with his friend Zhou Yiqing (34 years old, residing at No. 100, Qufu Road) to extort Tang.

First, Feng had repeatedly gathered in Room 303 of the Central Hotel to discuss the matter. Finally, they went to Suzhou together and colluded with Cao Mingchuan, a lawyer at No. 38, Wuqufang, Suzhou, and Huang Yunpeng, a dismissed employee of the Minsu News Agency. Feng Yixin, three people, were drafted by Cao to accuse Tang of treason to the Jiangsu Provincial High Procuratorate. After the office accepted it, it transferred it to the Shanghai High Procuratorate for review, and it is currently under investigation. On the morning of the 25th of last month, Feng Zhen suddenly went to Tang's residence in Wuxing Road and posted slogans accusing Tang of treason. He happened to be seen by a police officer from Changshu Road Police Station, who stepped forward to interfere. Feng showed the receipt of the complaint and was released. At the end of last month, Tang reported to the Changshu Road Police Station that he was being blackmailed. After investigation by the police station, Feng Zhen, Cao Mingchuan, Feng Yixin, and Zhou Yiqing were arrested. According to their confession, they planned to extort 200 gold bars from Tang, but later changed it to 4 billion yuan, and had met several times. The investigation of the case has now been completed, and all the criminals were sent to the Local Procuratorate yesterday for punishment.

### "True and False Wives" Case Opens - Two Defendants are Far Away in the United States - Bank Director Sues for Injustice - Denies Selling Wife to Help Embezzlement

[Our report] The "True and False Wives" case opened for the first time in the Third Criminal Court of the Local Court yesterday afternoon. The defendants, Xie Jiashu and Gao Qinqiu, who are in charge of the consulate in San Francisco, did not arrive because they were in the United States. Xu Liangyi, the director of the Nanshi Branch of the Shanghai City Bank, and the complainant, Li Yunyi, arrived yesterday. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs once entrusted a lawyer to bring a letter to the court to prove that Xie Gao had a marital relationship. However, Li strongly denounced his false claim that Xie Gao had never taken a day off or entertained a guest when he worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and that his marriage certificate was forged. After Gao Chang received 800 US dollars in travel expenses, he handed it over to Xu to do business. Xu Liangyi argued that he had divorced Gao Qinqiu long ago. Because Gao had nowhere to live after coming to Shanghai, he lived in the house allocated to him. When reporting to the household registration, he still reported the head of household as Xu Liangyi, and he did not know it at all. He is a man of status and would not sell a wife for 800 US dollars. He was accused of helping embezzlement, which is a real injustice. The court believes that this case requires the return of Xie Jiashu and Gao Qinqiu, who are in the United States, to the country for questioning before it can be clarified. It was ordered to change the date for retrial.

### Labor Relief Committee Reviews Work - Increases Wages and Food Expenses

All Winter Relief Shelters Will End by the End of April

[Our report] The Labor Relief Committee of the Winter Relief Association convened a discussion with the directors of the labor relief shelters and the engineers of the engineering districts of the Public Works Bureau at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday. Li Jianhua presided over the review of the labor relief work. It was decided that the daily rice supply for labor relief refugees will still be maintained at 28 taels, and the food expenses will be increased from 120,000 yuan to 160,000 yuan from March 1.

Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: I have read in your esteemed newspaper about the requisitioning of the Hardoon Garden case in the City Council, and there is a significant difference between what was reported and my original remarks and views. I stated at the time that whether or not Hardoon Garden should be requisitioned or donated was still undecided, but requests for building libraries, art galleries, gazetteer halls, and even primary schools had already come one after another, which I found very strange. During the discussion of this case in the previous session of the council, I mentioned that the reason for the reservation was to inquire about the opinion of the Executive Yuan regarding whether or not it could be requisitioned. Later, the Executive Yuan replied that it could be requisitioned, and if it were to be requisitioned, it must be done in accordance with the law. As for the so-called 570 billion, since the owner has not yet formally proposed it, why should we worry about it on their behalf? At the same time, there are many rumors circulating outside about this case. Even Mayor Wu, during his recent report, said that some people were suspicious. How could we possibly doubt Mayor Wu? All my colleagues in the council are people of high character and representatives of the public. How can we make reckless speculations? However, I object to ordering the Hardoon owner to donate land for theater construction because of the council's advocacy for rent collection or requisition. Such a result would be tantamount to a blackmail-style exchange condition. That was roughly what I said at the time. I respectfully request that this letter be published in the "Letters to the Editor" section to clarify the truth. I am deeply grateful. Respectfully, Zhang Zhihan

### "Double Gun" Sister Ba Arrives in Hangzhou

Director Liang Qiang inspected the highways of the Hangzhou Engineering Office. Mr. Shou Chang and I participated in this trip. We transferred from Shao Dian to Zha Pu, and it was already dusk when we arrived. We stayed at the Haifeng Hotel, which is the best hotel in Xi Pu. The rooms were spacious, but the furnishings were a little simple. I asked the tea server: "Where does a Ms. Wang Ba Mei live in this area?" He said that she is the owner of this hotel. I wanted to visit this legendary figure from the War of Resistance, but the tea server told me that she had gone to Ping Hu.

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 5th] Last summer, a young man named Lin Zhao Guo, the secretary of the Haining Youth League, came to tell me that their Ten District Youth League Association had held a meeting in Zha Pu and met "Double Gun" Sister Ba. He told me how hospitable and chivalrous she was. He also said that he could introduce me to see her in Wu Pu and that he could accompany me.

Legendary Hotel Owner

In early autumn last year, the First District Highway Bureau... [Sentence incomplete in original.] In early winter last year, Shou Chang, An E, Zhang Ruifang, Ying Yunwei, and others came to see me in Hangzhou via Zha Pu from Shanghai. They said that they had indeed met Wang Ba Mei to discuss filming the "Tide of the Qiantang River" movie. They described her as forthright, frank, and enthusiastic. They also said that she was short, very sturdy, with a copper-colored complexion, and clearly weathered by the elements.

Brave Subordinates, Intimidated Enemies

Some say Wang Ba Mei protected salt boats before the war. Later, when the war started, she organized a guerrilla force to fight against the Japanese invaders. Of course, she lacked weapons and money, but all her subordinates were very brave and truly killed Japanese devils. In the moment before victory, she even commanded a convoy, consisting of three battalions and nine companies. She roamed the coasts and rivers of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, active on the land of Jiangnan, causing headaches and annoyance for the Japanese enemy. Many stories about her are quite legendary. For example, the tea server at the Haifeng Hotel told us that one day, Commander Huang was surrounded by many enemies. She crouched down, pulled out two pistols, and fired several shots, finally killing several enemies, while the rest of the enemies ran away in fright.

Not long ago, newspapers reported that Wang Ba Mei's subordinates had defected and fled to the Haikou and Siming Mountain areas, establishing communication lines. However, shortly thereafter, Gong Ba Mei came out to declare that this was not true and pointed out that those traitors were definitely not her subordinates.

Busy in War, Pilgrimage to Sacred Mountains

Many female soldiers originally served under her command. However, after the victory, some got married, and others returned home. After the victory, her troops were reduced from three battalions to one battalion, and one battalion was reorganized into a security police company. The remaining demobilized officers and soldiers mostly went into business or farming. She herself opened the Haifeng Hotel and several shops in Zha Pu. In the Huangshan scenic area, she built a tavern. In Zha Pu town, she founded a complete primary school that can accommodate more than 300 students. She also maintained the coastal lighthouse for ships sailing in the wind and rain.

She is a devout Buddhist. Even though she was busy with the war during the eight years of resistance, she always made pilgrimages to sacred mountains. Now, her main activity is to worship Bodhisattvas.

Ding Xisan's Bandit Group's Deployment

Recently, Wang Ba Mei came to Hangzhou, along with the Ping Hu County Magistrate. Chairman Shen met with her and hosted a banquet for her. Deputy Commander of Security Zhu Ming Cou also hosted a banquet for her. According to her, this visit was for the purpose of burning incense. According to people in the provincial government, Chairman Shen asked about her when he went to Ping Hu. This time, she came to pay her respects to Chairman Shen. The Chairman's banquet for her was a gesture of courtesy. When talking about Ding Xisan, she said that many bandits initially came to deploy and incite the hard-working masses, urging them to join the "struggle". Ding Xisan originally intended to land at Jinshanwei in Ping Hu, but later changed his plans temporarily and landed in Fengxian. The Shanghai Garrison Command had already learned of this intelligence, and I was summoned to Shanghai to attend a joint meeting.

A Daughter Studying in Middle School

Wang Ba Mei is now a County Councilor in Ping Hu County. Her actual surname is Huang, and she was once named Bai Mei, and now she is named Bai Qi. She has a daughter who is sixteen years old and studying at Ping Hu Middle School. It is said that she also has an extraordinary female bodyguard who can swim while carrying her on her back and can shoot with two guns simultaneously.

According to Zhang Ruifang and An E, Ms. Huang is also quite humorous. She has a pair of black leather shoes with flat heels and a somewhat platform sole. In her room, there are also scented soaps and snow creams. Her residence also has a Buddhist hall and is a clean and bright house leaning against the mountains and facing the sea.

No Education, Only Knows How to Shoot

She often humbly says: "I have no education and only know how to shoot." However, all the experiences in her life journey are knowledge that cannot be learned from books.

Now, she has left Hangzhou and returned to Zha Pu, which makes me think of this important town on the coast, where the dilapidated forts of the late Qing Dynasty remain. It is a strategic military location and the eastern major port planned by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. We hope that there will be more enthusiastic and chivalrous people like Ms. Huang Bai Qi to make Zha Pu prosperous and strong!

### Golden Macau

The existence of a gold market here has created one of the largest economic loopholes in the country today. Most people only know about Hong Kong and ignore Macau, which has led to Macau's abnormal development.

[Our Hong Kong Dispatch on the 4th] On the land of China, there is a place where many people carry ten taels of gold each day with the official permission of customs, and they keep running into the country. The distinction between domestic and foreign is only a "customs gate". Once you exit the "Customs Gate" and pass through customs (Gongbei Customs), you are inside the country. Once you find a place in the country to put down the ten taels of gold, you can turn around and run back abroad, and then bring another ten taels of gold into the country legitimately. Even if the customs officers are familiar with your face, they will not confiscate your gold or put you in detention. In this place, it is not illegal to bring ten taels of gold into the country from abroad each time. Therefore, you only have to worry about your capital not being enough, and you don't have to worry about not making a fortune. This is the gold supply for Guangzhou, Hankou, and even Shanghai. This is the only normal way for people to bring gold into the country besides the official government channels. It can also be said that it is a...

convenient gate in the current domestic financial market. This place is Macau, the southernmost part of Zhongshan County, Guangdong, separated from Hong Kong by forty miles of sea.

Since Shanghai and Hong Kong successively banned the import and export of gold, Macau has suddenly become a gold market in the Far East today. Mexican gold and American gold are continuously shipped by air from Manila to Macau and then transported into the country. According to conservative estimates from customs officials, at least an average of one thousand taels of gold are shipped from Macau to the mainland every day, not counting large-scale smuggling. Currently, many merchants buy gold in Macau, transport it to Hankou, and then buy products from Central China and transport them back via the Yuehan Railway. It is said that the profits are quite considerable. The Macau gold market uses the old scale, while Hankou uses the new scale. Every ten taels of gold gains two additional taels, which becomes their guaranteed profit.

According to investigations by the economic sector, there are at least two Chinese-owned banks in Hong Kong and Macau that have huge amounts of US dollars deposited in the United States for the purpose of importing gold. They ship gold from the United States to Macau and then immediately use various methods in Hong Kong to purchase an equivalent value of

US dollar foreign exchange to replenish their deposits in New York. Macau's gold imports are endless, while the US dollar foreign exchange in Hong Kong (mostly from returning overseas Chinese, tourist checks, American military personnel in Hong Kong, and wealthy individuals from Shanghai) is limited. As a result, the black market exchange rate for US dollars in Hong Kong is rising daily, and the price of gold is also increasing accordingly. Due to the existence of the gold market, Macau has now become one of the largest economic loopholes in the country today. Most people only knew about Hong Kong and ignored Macau, which led to the abnormal development of Macau. Recently, after Ding Guitang, Deputy Director-General of Customs, visited Macau, Rogers, Financial Advisor to the Central Bank, and Yu Yingjie, a representative of the Central Bank, rushed from Shanghai to Macau to discuss a Sino-Macau agreement similar to the Sino-Hong Kong agreement with the Macau authorities. Nourished by

gold, Macau has gradually recovered from its post-war decline. The Macau government is increasing the business tax on the gold market and collecting a deposit of five million yuan, while issuing new Macanese patacas to withdraw old patacas. As a result, credit is tight. Coinciding with the rise of the US dollar, the Hong Kong dollar in Macau recently only had a value of seven corners and nine fen in Macanese patacas (usually almost at par). Hong Kong merchants "raised" Macau, but were bitten back by Macau, and it was too late to cry out in pain! The Macau government's budget for this year, announced on February 20, totals 11,162,605 yuan, an increase of nearly 30 percent compared to last year's 8,709,018 yuan, which can be interpreted as Macau Governor Albino Rodrigues Coutinho's statement that "Macau's society and commercial prosperity have already undergone a major turnaround."

The existence of the gold market has propelled Macau into a new stage. The reporter would like to add a sentence at the end of this short article: I hope that the people of the country will not only know about Hong Kong and forget about Macau! (Special Correspondent Zi Jian)

### Strange Incident of Conscription in Hangzhou: Wife Sells Husband

For a Price of 12 Million Yuan

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 5th] A strange incident of a wife selling her husband recently occurred in Hangzhou, causing a sensation far and wide. The man who was sold, named Ma Jisheng, is a rickshaw puller, 40 years old, originally from Shaoxing, and lives at No. 5, Lane 2, Fuhai Li, Gongchen Bridge. He married a woman named Gao Ma, who was a twice-remarried widow, very ugly and promiscuous. She had an affair with Wang Lianqing, a small worker at the nearby Sanba Soy Sauce Factory. Later, she had an affair with a carpenter nicknamed "Zizi" at Nanxing Bridge and cohabited with him. Ma was lazy by nature, and as long as he had old wine in hand, he didn't care about anything else. On the tenth day of the Lunar New Year, Gao suddenly invited Ma to drink at the house of Shi Jianfei in Nanxing Bridge. Ma went with his neighbor, Li Amao, but then disappeared. Later, through the diligent efforts of Li's mother and younger brother, Kun Sheng, it was learned that Ma had been sold by Gao in collusion with her lover, Wang Qing, to Shi Jianfei to serve as a conscript for a price of 12 million national currency. Gao received 9 million, and Shi received 3 million. Li then reported this to the Criminal Police Team, who arrested Gao, Shi, and others. They are currently under strict interrogation.

### A Town Head in Wu County Bribes to Release Conscripts; Removed from Office and Investigated

[Our Wu County Dispatch on the 5th] Cao Ziheng, the town head of Jinzhe in the urban area, abused his power during the first term of emergency conscription in 1948 by accepting bribes ranging from 30 to 50 million per person to release conscripts. He was recently reported to the Wu County Regiment Management District Command. The military law office of the command arrested him. After investigation, the allegations were found to be true. He was temporarily released on bail with the guarantee of three reliable shops and 2,000 yuan in cash. The entire case has been transferred to the Wu District Prosecutor's Office for investigation in accordance with the law. The county government has ordered his removal from office.

### Journey to Shanxi (II): Integration of Soldiers and Farmers

[Our Taiyuan Dispatch on the 2nd] In the conference room of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, the screen door was inscribed with: "Treat people with tolerance and you will win them over; handle affairs with moderation and you will succeed." There was also a couplet: "Moderation is the ultimate principle of governance; to attain moderation is to survive, to lose moderation is to perish." Therefore, it is probably correct to say that General Yan's approach to dealing with matters in Shanxi today is based on "moderation" as the starting point for his thoughts and theories. At the same time, the Communist bandits today are rampant because they take advantage of two gaps: the political flaws of the government's actions that cannot fully satisfy the people's needs, and the economic loopholes of the excessive disparity between the rich and the poor. This objective environment is enough to make him find a way out from the word "moderation." General Yan simply explained: "Now the country needs soldiers, and the people need to live. If we can find a moderate solution, we can take care of both sides." Therefore, the "integration of soldiers and farmers" proposed during the War of Resistance in Western Jin is even more active today.

The New Era Well-Field System

The "integration of soldiers and farmers" is, in fact, the "well-field system" of the new era. It breaks the contradiction between "land concentration" and "land use dispersion" and thoroughly saves the rural areas that have been on the verge of bankruptcy for centuries. At the same time, it also provides an absolute guarantee for the conscription system.

The most important content of the "integration of soldiers and farmers" is the division of land. Unlike the Communist bandits' brutal killing of landlords and confiscation of land, or issuing public bonds to buy land, it simply stipulates that each field should pay one tael of silver grain and one dan of rent (one tael of silver grain is equivalent to about eight to twelve mu of land, re-averaged according to yield into seven grades and thirty-one levels). The landlord retains ownership, the farmers obtain the right to use the land, and the government manages the distribution rights. In the past, farmers paid rent to landlords, amounting to as much as seven dou to one dan and one dou per mu. Although the current one tael of silver grain and one dan of rent can still be considered a form of exploitation, and it cannot achieve the goal of "land to the tiller" as advocated by the Founding Father of the Republic, but only land for the tiller to "cultivate," this partial realization of "equal land rights" is, despite its imperfections, seemingly quite valuable, given that it is not completely adapted to the local environment.

Standards and Organization of Land Distribution

The standard of land allocation is that the number of mu that two farm laborers can cultivate is considered a small portion, and it is allocated to one soldier and one farmer (regular soldiers, reservists, national soldiers), who cultivate it jointly with their families. If the family labor force is insufficient, supplementary labor will be arranged to assist. The principle is that the income of one farm laborer should be able to support four people. In order to facilitate the arrival of collective mechanized cultivation in the future, six small portions of land are combined into one large portion when dividing the land. On this basis, it will be possible to consolidate labor in the future for industrial production and construction. The second is the organization of preferential treatment. Six males aged 18 to 47 voluntarily form a group. Each person receives a small portion of land, one person serves in the regular army for three years on rotation; one person serves as a reservist and goes to war in case of conflict; and four people serve as national soldiers. Two national soldiers provide preferential treatment to one regular soldier, and two national soldiers provide preferential treatment to one reservist. That is, after the regular soldiers and reservists enter the military, the people can choose how to handle the land allocation: (1) Assistance Method - help with labor, (2) Withdrawal Method - distribute grain, (3) Contribution Method - provide grain and take responsibility for planting, (4) Conversion Method - convert grain into labor. In this way, each regular soldier and reservist can receive at least six dan of grain (rice, wheat) and twelve jin of cotton.

The landlords receive one dan of rent for one tael of silver grain, which, strictly speaking, is still "unearned income." Therefore, they have to pay 20% of the progressive relief grain to provide relief to the old, weak, and helpless. In addition, compulsory national education and democratic politics for national soldiers can be started from scratch.

Slogan: Nine Goods and Four Nots

The land in the "integration of soldiers and farmers" is permanent. "Those who have permanent property have a stable mind." Everyone cultivates the land well. Each organized group must help and protect each other, assist with labor and grain, and ensure that they do not communicate with bandits or flee. The details are specified in even greater detail. General Guan often boasts about this: "There are now more people farming and more people serving in the military in Shanxi Province." Therefore, he shouted the slogans "Nine Goods" and "Four Nots." The "Nine Goods" are: (1) Soldiers receive preferential treatment. (2) Farmers have enough land to cultivate, and the results of their labor are privately owned. (3) Burdens are fairly distributed. (4) The old and weak receive relief. (5) Educational opportunities are equal. (6) Right and wrong are treated equally. (7) Living standards are equal. (8) National soldiers have stable occupations. (9) Regular soldiers have permanent property." The "Four Nots" are: "No poor people, no idle people, no bad people, no foolish people?" Currently, the cultivated area in the 19 cities and counties in the Jinzhong District is approximately 8.4 million mu. Except for the mountainous areas close to the bandit areas, 202,892 portions have already been allocated, and it is estimated that 40,000 more portions will be added this year.

Experiment Zone for Integrating Soldiers and Farmers

The press corps visited the local "Experiment Zone for Integrating Soldiers and Farmers" in Jinci, southwest of Taiyuan. This historical site, where King Cheng of Zhou enfeoffed his brother, the Tang Huai and Zhou Bai trees, ancient and vigorous, evoke nostalgia for the past. The Nanlao Spring, crystal clear, is a welcome comfort in this vast plain where yellow sand rolls all day long.

The People's Defense Army was training intensely on the parade ground. We separately entered this small town and sought in-depth inquiries from the people. Most of the extremely poor people and tenant farmers are now smiling because their lives have a permanent footing. They said that in the past, they had to kowtow to the landlords every year, begging for a living. They had no clothes to wear, no surplus grain, and could not even find a wife. Today, everyone is well-matched. Some landlords clearly had forced smiles on their faces. For the sake of the masses, they had to sacrifice their own interests. Did you not see the pavilions and towers in the Jinci villas of the former Taiyuan Garrison Commander and Artillery Commander? Now, only broken bricks and collapsed walls remain, and thousands of mu of fertile fields have become land shares, taken from the people and returned to the people today!

### Qingpu Grain Office Staff Member Zhang Ping Escapes but is Recaptured

[Our Qingpu Dispatch on the 5th] Zhang Ping, a custodian at the Fangjia Yao collection warehouse of the Grain Office, was found to have engaged in illegal surcharges and malfeasance by the authorities. He was detained at the Security Brigade headquarters in late December of last year. While the investigation was ongoing and transfer to judicial authorities was being planned, Zhang suddenly took advantage of an opportunity to escape on Lunar New Year's Eve. Security Brigade Captain Wang Jialiang secretly instructed officers to investigate. They learned that Zhang was hiding at the Jinshan Hotel on Second Ma Road in Shanghai. On the 3rd, they dispatched personnel to Shanghai to arrest him and bring him back to the county for trial.

### Guard County Uncovers a Case of Selling Conscripts; Two Key Suspects Transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for Investigation

[Our Heng County Dispatch on the 4th] This county recently uncovered two cases of selling conscripts. (1) The county government received reports that many outside troop traffickers have recently been active in the county. It instructed its subordinates to secretly investigate, and they arrested troop traffickers Hu Tingxian and Jiang Yihua at the Xianxia Hotel on the 2nd. The two suspects were inciting conscripts in Dingwei and sending them to Longyou for sale. (2) Xu Shuigen, a resident of the city, does not engage in honest work and specializes in trafficking conscripts. Many people have been deceived. He was also arrested at his residence in front of the banknote factory on the same day. The suspects in both cases have been transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

### Hainan Factory Affairs Bureau to be Established

[Our Haikou Dispatch on the 6th] Guo Nan, the director of the Hainan Mining Bureau, is scheduled to come here at the end of the month to establish the bureau. It is said that after the bureau is established, the first phase of the plan will be to restore the Changjiang County Lidong Hydropower Plant, use electricity for mining, and establish coal and steel plants in Beili, Tiandu, and Basuo. Due to security concerns, the Shilu Iron Mine may not be mined in the short term. As for the Tiandu Iron Mine, since it is located near Yulin Port, it can be put into operation under the protection of the fortress command's forces. It has 500,000 tons of ore. It is said that the United Kingdom and the United States will purchase it at a price of US$7.5 per ton.

### Zhejiang Salt Sales Stagnant; Seeking to Exchange for Jiangxi Rice

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 6th] Since the increase in salt tax, the cost of Zhejiang salt has greatly increased, leading to stagnant sales.

### Greening Hangzhou: Work Underway

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch on the 5th] Renovating scenic spots in spring is an annual routine for the municipal government. The railings and walls of the Lakeside Park, Pinghu Qiuyue, Zhongshan Park, and other places have begun to be repainted, and "greening" work is also proceeding smoothly. In addition to 1.3 to 1.4 million seedlings prepared by the city itself, the Agricultural Improvement Institute has also agreed to allocate 180,000 seedlings. The provincial government has also agreed to allocate half of the funding.

"Relying on one spring for three winters" is the slogan of the people of Hangzhou. Therefore, spring also makes Hangzhou a valuable place. For example, the Songmu Courtyard is a place where incense boats gather, and the rental fee for a stall selling snacks is as high as several dan of grain.

The spring water is rising. The water level of the Qiantang River's shallowest section, Qibao, has also risen to two meters. Ships of 500 tons can navigate without obstruction. According to Deputy Director Wang of the Dyke Construction Bureau, this ideal water level can be maintained until this winter, which means that navigation on the Qiantang River has reached a mature stage this year.

The city's winter relief work is scheduled to end at the end of this month. It is reported that the issuance of funds to poor households and the disbursement of resettlement fees for more than 200 refugees in shelters have been completely abandoned due to financial difficulties.

Two hundred meters from the shore south of Lianhua Pond at Lao Jikou, the water depth reaches six meters, making it an excellent location for building a wharf. Further south, near Guihua Garden, it can be used as a wave shelter and for ship repairs. The section south of Liugong Temple to the customs house has calm winds and waves, making it a good anchorage for ships. Following this inspection, it is planned to proceed actively, first establishing a preparatory office to begin surveying work.

### Peking Research Institute Plans to Build an Atomic Building, High Costs Make it Difficult to Realize Temporarily

[This Newspaper Report] After the Radium Research Institute of the National Peking Research Institute was ordered to be renamed the Atomic Research Institute, it was planned to build an atomic building behind the Institute of Physics and Chemistry building of the institute on the gate of the Peking Royal City as the usage of the "Physics" and "Atomic" Research Institutes. At present, due to the huge cost required, this academic plan is difficult to realize in the short term. According to Lu Xueshan, the acting director of the institute, he has not yet been informed how the institute's major plan is proceeding; however, he believes that the importance of scientific research is valued by all informed people today, and even if this major plan cannot be realized in the short term due to lack of funding, it will inevitably be realized one day in the course of scientific research in our country and for the needs of national defense. Speaking of the current national economic situation, he believes that if the government cannot use huge amounts of funds to increase new equipment for scientific research, it can cooperate with research institutions and organizations that have already achieved results, which can also achieve some effects. This kind of cooperation has been done in the past and present, but the degree of cooperation still needs to be strengthened. In other words, the supplementary funds required for cooperation by various research institutions and organizations must have a necessary increase.

### City Councilors Suggest that the Central National School in the Old Zhabei District Be Reorganized from Gezhi Middle School

[This Newspaper Report] City Councilors Yan E'sheng, Zhang Yiqu, Jiang Pingfan, Hou Jiyuan, Fang Rusheng, Tao Guangchuan, Yu Chuanding, Gu Zhuxuan, Jiang Hao, Yu Shun, Zhu Wende, Zhang Zhongyuan, Yi Xia, Huang Zenshi, Chen Weijian, Li Kaidi, Chen Deyi, Zhou Chengxiang, Xu Xueyu, Gao Shuan, Chen Peide, Wang Weiyin, Cen Zhiliang, Zhan Wenhu, Zhou Feicheng, Zhang Xuelian, Tong Xingbai, Zhang, Dong Rengui, Chen Baotai, Zhuang Ping, Chen Jieru, Tian Shujun, Shi Zongde, Zhu Liangcai, Mao Jia, Zhang Zhihan, Ji Hao, Guo Linshuang, Chen Gaoyong, He Chengfu, Ma Junshuo, and other forty-two people suggested to this session of the City Council that the original municipal Gezhi Middle School be reorganized into the Central National School of the Old Zhabei District and the original municipal library be reorganized into the National School of the Old Zhabei District to meet the urgent needs of national education. The reasons are as follows: "National education should be based on the principle of universal development. At present, there are many school-age children in the Old Zhabei District, but there is no municipal national school, which is quite unbalanced. The fourth session of this council resolved that at least five national schools should be established in the Old Zhabei District as soon as possible. However, the Education Bureau has made excuses for lacking public land and has delayed implementation, which is unsatisfactory. At this time of school shortage, we should weigh the priorities and plan comprehensively. In terms of importance, secondary schools seem to be slightly slower than primary schools. The original municipal Gezhi Middle School in the Old Zhabei District should be reorganized into the Central National School of the Old Zhabei District. Also, the municipal library, which is related to international observation, should not be located above a small vegetable market. The original municipal library above the Fuzhou Road small vegetable market should be reorganized into the National School of the Old Zhabei District." It is also proposed that the methods are as follows: (1) The municipal Gezhi Middle School should be reorganized into the Central National School of the Old Zhabei District. The original Gezhi Middle School should find another location for construction. The construction costs should be allocated by the municipal government from the municipal education funds by five-tenths, the Old Zhabei District should raise one-tenth, and four-tenths should be allocated after the sale of the Hardoon Charity Fund's real estate. (2) The municipal library should be reorganized into the National School of the Old Zhabei District. The original library should find another location, which should be handled by the municipal government in a unified manner. The City Council plenary session resolved yesterday to submit it to the Education Committee for review and handling.

### Jiaotong University's New Moral Education Policy: Cultivate Students' Sense of Shame, Disciplinary Actions Will Not Be Announced

[This Newspaper Report] Jiaotong University has recently formulated a new moral education policy, stipulating that in the future, students who violate school rules and should be punished will not be announced. The school will send a notification to parents and guarantors separately, and a copy will be handed to the punished student in person by the counselor, who will give earnest guidance. If the matter concerns the entire student body and should be announced for warning purposes, only the facts will be announced, without specifying names, to cultivate students' sense of shame and guide the school spirit to become more pure. The school explained the meaning of this new moral education policy as follows: "It is necessary to cultivate character as the first priority during the period of students' schooling, and the most important thing to cultivate character is to know shame. Those who are above average are ashamed of not being sages and sages, those who are average are also ashamed of their achievements not being as good as others, and those who are below average will conceal their improper behavior as much as possible, fearing that others will know. All of this is the good knowledge of knowing shame. Although there is an obvious difference between the wise and the foolish, they are the same in knowing shame. Schools train students, stimulating those who do not know shame, and cultivating those who know shame. There is no way to achieve the purpose of education by cultivating the habit of shamelessness. In the old customs of the former Qing Dynasty, a tiger-head tablet was hung in the school courtyard, with military sticks hanging below. Whenever a student violated the rules, the punishment and facts would be written on the tiger-head tablet and announced to the public. The situation was generally handled according to the established regulations of the court's public judgment. The students who violated the rules were like criminals. This is really contrary to the purpose of cultivating a sense of shame, and especially contrary to the great teaching of concealing evil and promoting good. The old habits of national subjugation are not to be blamed. In recent years, it has been changed to an announcement. Although it is slightly different from the form of sentencing, it is not enough to cultivate the habit of knowing shame, so there is no great difference in the first place. Young students, with unstable blood and energy, occasionally have faults and violate school rules. Although they have to be punished, they also hope that they will reform and do good. Why should we point out their faults in a place where everyone can see, so that they are criticized everywhere and have nowhere to hide, and even cut off their path to self-renewal. What is the difference between such guidance and going south by driving the chariot north? Moreover, foreign universities never have public punishments. Why should we follow the old habits of the former Qing Dynasty, abandon the models of the advanced, and forget the ancient teachings of our country?"

### Director Li Gave Instructions on This Semester's Guidance Work

[This Newspaper Report] Deputy Director Li of the Municipal Education Bureau summoned all supervisors to the bureau at 3:30 PM yesterday to discuss the guidance work for this semester and gave the following instructions: (1) This semester, many private schools have applied to increase tuition fees by 20% according to the prescribed fee standards. Each supervisor should strictly investigate the use of fees by each school to see if it is used for the construction of educational facilities. Regarding poor students, if all schools in the city can truly achieve the 25% free quota, then there will not be so many out-of-school school-age children in the city. To prevent principals from being opportunistic, each supervisor should strictly investigate whether the fees waived by each school account for one-quarter of the total number of students, not just whether the number of students accounts for one-quarter. (2) Physical education, labor-aesthetics, music, Boy Scouts, physics and chemistry, and other specialized inspections should use their strengths to reduce the workload of case investigation and focus on guidance work, which will be more effective. (3) Although the organization of student parent-teacher associations in each school has many difficulties, parents with the ability should be strongly urged to complete the organization. (4) For greening education, the Education Bureau has already allocated tree seedlings. Each supervisor should especially urge each school to plant trees on Arbor Day. Deputy Director Li also specifically pointed out that the main responsibility of supervisors is not only to pay attention to the expenditure of education funds and strive for their proper use, and to supervise school facilities and strive for their properness. Supervisors are actually friends and consultants of teachers and should jointly strive for the progress of education in a research-oriented manner. In particular, rural supervisors can stay in the countryside for a day or two to understand the school environment and know how to improve and guide it.

At the same time, the school has begun to organize two tour groups to prepare for collective spring outings during the spring break.

Of course, the school also specially takes into account the pain of poor students.

In addition, the school's music department will hold a grand concert soon, and the Shanghai University Orchestra and Sacred Music Choir have begun practicing. In late March, the school's English Drama Society also plans to publicly perform the famous English drama "Gong Baochuan" at the Lyceum Theatre, with President Ling and others personally participating in the direction and recruiting actors on campus. At the same time, the organization of the teams has also begun actively. In addition to the competitions between the various levels of fellowships, the teacher-faculty team organized by the faculty and staff challenged the senior year basketball team, the champion of the previous year. That day, President Ling, in the posture of the captain of the East China Eight Universities Basketball Championship team, put on his uniform and went into battle bravely, but lost by only a few points.

A Winding Path Around the Campus, Over 6,000 Feet Long

In terms of psychological construction, Shanghai University has indeed achieved great success, but it is still working hard to expand in terms of material things to achieve the realm of truth, goodness, and beauty. The new concrete tennis court will be completed soon, and the funds for the new female dormitory have been donated by foreign churches. Recently, bricks and stones have been shipped [missing text] to the school and will begin construction within ten days. Also, in order to commemorate the late President Liu, it is planned to expand the library and name it Zhan Enguo.

A philanthropist has generously agreed to donate the entire amount. The basketball hall is relatively intact, but the floor is missing. The current plan is to lay foreign pine in the center of the hall and domestic pine planks on the sides. All materials have been purchased and are ready for installation. The recreation room has not been damaged and only needs to be painted. Regarding the units participating in the National Games, according to Hao Gengsheng, the Preparatory Committee has issued 60 invitations, and it is estimated that approximately 3,000 athletes from various provinces and cities will come to Shanghai to participate. The northwestern provinces will also send equestrian teams to participate in the performances. As for the accommodation and food issues, the Preparatory Committee has found many large houses nearby, and each unit will be responsible for its own meals. However, the committee has arranged for chefs from various regions to cater to the tastes of athletes from different places. The sports ground will begin preparations after the construction is completed. The National Games will last for eleven days and are expected to close on schedule. Hao Gengsheng returned to Beijing by car on the 3rd evening and is scheduled to come to Shanghai again next Tuesday.

Enkas Avenges Old Grievances, Dagong Team Suffers Defeat in Hard Battle, Green Forest Wins Division B2-A Championship

[Report from Our Newspaper] In the Division A basketball league, the powerful Enkas team from Xiqing defeated Dagong last night, 56-45, avenging their defeat in the first round. The score was 23-29 in the first half, with Dagong trailing by six points. Green Forest won the championship with a score of 57-32.

The previous night's victory of the United Nations team over the US Navy's Marines inevitably exhausted Dagong's main players, so they could not muster their energy in yesterday's battle. Their offensive play under the basket was also far inferior to Enkas. Although their individual skills were not weak, their cooperation was not satisfactory, and they fought individually. In contrast, Enkas pressed forward step by step, attacking and defending fiercely, which forced Dagong to admit defeat.

The Dagong-Enkas battle began at 7:30 PM after the first match. In the center jump, Cai Wenhua had excellent spring, and Ge Pengqiguofu was ashamed to be inferior. Bao Lai scored first, and after Tu Wenlong's efforts, the score was tied at 5-5. Zhong Qiang chased out and tied the score at 7-7. Wenzhang replaced Boling, and he and Wenhua launched a joint attack, 11-9. After the score was tied at 13-13, the situation began to change. Enkas increased their score to 20, and their offensive was formidable. Dagong repeatedly changed their lineup, but it was not very effective, and their luck was also poor. Fortunately, the long shots of Hua and Long embellished the game. In the first half, the score was 23-29, with Dagong trailing by six points. In the second half, Wenlong and Wenhua still supported the situation, but they were caught off guard and the opponent strode forward, with the score at 33-43, a difference of ten points. From then on, the victory or defeat was decided, and the overall situation was settled. Although Dagong fought a desperate battle, they could not stop the attack and finally lost to Enkas with a score of 45-56.

In the first match between Lulin and Tisheng, Le Jiazhou scored two points for Lulin, and Lin Shaohua made a free throw, leading 3-0. Tisheng's Tang Mingxin broke through the basket with one hand, intending to develop his game, but Lulin's Zheng Sen, Cunzhong Jiazhou, and Yunshan made repeated free throws, and Tisheng could not resist. In the first half, Lulin took the lead with a score of 30-16. In the second half, the lineups of both sides were changed, but the game was still controlled by Lulin. At the end of the time, Lulin easily defeated Tisheng with a score of 57-32, winning the championship of the group.

The Surge in Rice Prices Spreads in the North and South Markets, Japonica and Indica Both Reach New High Prices, Sales Increase on Weekends, and Prices in Major Production Areas Rise Sharply Again

[Report from Our Newspaper] The rice market rose sharply yesterday, and sales were brisk. High-quality japonica rice reached a new high price of 3.4 million yuan. All goods rose by 250,000 to 300,000 yuan compared to the previous day. It is reported that the reasons for the rise were: (1) The production area reported an increase of more than 200,000 yuan. (2) The shops were quite eager to stock up. (3) Credit was unusually loose. Incoming goods were not smooth.

Yesterday, 3,779 dan of goods were registered to arrive in the South Market, and 5,193 dan in the North Market. Market prices: high-quality japonica rice, 3.3 million in the South Market, 3.4 million in the North Market. White japonica rice, 3.27 million in the South Market, 3.32 million in the North Market. Thin indica rice, 3.25 million in the South Market, 3.3 million in the North Market. Early indica rice, 3.1 million in the South Market, 3.2 million in the North Market. Sheep indica rice, 3.17 million in the South Market, 3.33 million in the North Market. Baiyuan rice, 3.25 million in the South Market, 3.34 million in the North Market. Xianyuan rice, 3.1 million in the South Market, 3.05 million in the North Market.

Flour: Prices in Suzhou and Wuxi are both high, and the main holders are determined to hold on. Retail sales are quite eager to stock up. Prices jumped as soon as the market opened due to the psychology of tightness. Bingshen flour opened at 1.42 million, briefly returned to 1.415 million in the middle, and then immediately rose to 1.42 million yuan, 80,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The trading of Lao Che flour was not as active as Bingshen, and the price was 1.44 million, and the after-delivery price was also 1.44 million. Hongfeng Jiancheng initially opened at 1.4 million and closed at 1.305 million yuan. Bran rose sharply, with large packages rising by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Wheat was priced at 2 million, but did not open.

Miscellaneous Grains: Rose across the board, with prices slightly retreating at the close. Soybeans rose particularly strongly, rising by more than 100,000 early in the day, but sales were average, and the price finally retreated slightly, rising by 100,000. The same was true for corn, which rose by 100,000 early in the day, but Qingdao prices were not high, and the merchant groups were not stocking up much. Therefore, the market retreated later, slightly higher than the previous day by 30,000 yuan. Picked qing beans were actively sold in the local market, rising by 50,000. Tea beans rose by more than 100,000, and red sorghum also rose by 100,000 yuan. Sesame was not stocked by the Tianjin merchants, and the market was stagnant. Raw peanuts were sold in the local market, rising slightly by 100,000, while mid-grade peanuts were average.

Edible Oil: The sentiment was extremely firm and expensive at the beginning of the opening. There were many back-and-forth transactions of soybean oil, and the opening was the firmest. Due to the strong support of the holders, the market opened high. Dayou soybean oil opened at 6.55 million, once calling for 6.6 million, but ultimately the opening price was too high, and the local market was sufficient. Retail investors sold at high prices, and the market softened later. Soybean oil fell to 6.5 million and 6.45 million, still 200,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Qingdao Ji barrel raw oil rose from 7.45 million to 7.5 million, 300,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Raw vegetable sesame oil each rose by more than 200,000, and small car sesame oil followed suit, rising by 300,000. Bean cake rose by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan under the psychology of tightness.

Song Hanzhang and Others Promote the National Goods Export Movement

Song Hanzhang, Weng Wenhao, Qian Xinzhi, Zhang Xiaomei, and others invited people from all walks of life to talk on the 14th floor of the International Hotel at noon yesterday to promote the export of national goods. More than 30 people, including Shen Xirui, Zhao Dihua, Shou Yicheng, Wang Zhixin, Lu Zuofu, Hu Xiyuan, and Wang Xingyao, attended. During the meeting, Mr. Song Hanzhang delivered a speech, stating that the national goods movement has been advocated for many years. In the past, the direction of efforts was biased towards the domestic market. Although considerable achievements have also been made in exports, the ideal has not yet been fully realized. Today, the export of national goods has become an urgent need. People from all walks of life feel that only by working hard to promote the export of national goods can the industry have a way out and move forward. After discussion by the attendees, it was unanimously decided to set up a China National Goods Export Movement Committee, and Song Hanzhang, Weng Wenqian, Xin, Zhi Zhang Xiaomei were elected as the presidium. Cai Chengxin, Wang Xingyao, and Pan Yangyao were appointed as conveners of the preparatory committee. The committee's work outline was also determined as follows: (1) Assist various industries in actively promoting exports, (2) Promote consistent public opinion, (3) Suggest that the government implement effective rewards, (4) Advise factories to pay attention to technological improvements.

The Allocation Situation of Aluminum Quotas in the Shanghai Area in the Fourth Quarter

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the Management Committee, with the exception of a portion set aside for the import of small quantities of aluminum tubes and other raw materials that cannot be produced domestically, the majority of the aluminum quota is used to import aluminum ingots for the manufacture of aluminum sheets and aluminum foil. Therefore, the aluminum ingot quota is divided into two parts: sheet manufacturing and foil manufacturing. Aluminum sheets are the main raw material for the aluminumware industry. In the past, because the industry did not have a public association organization, directly allocating quotas was not comprehensive. Therefore, the aluminum ingot quota for rolling aluminum sheets in the first, second, and third quarters was temporarily allocated to rolling mills (a total of seven rolling mills, including six Chinese-owned and one foreign-owned Hualu Steel Refinement Factory). In the fourth quarter, the Shanghai Aluminumware Industry Association was established and requested direct allocation of manufacturing raw materials. The Management Committee proposed $85,800 USD from the quota to allocate to the factories in the industry. However, it was still stipulated that the rolling mills should apply for import on their behalf and roll them into sheets for use as raw materials to prevent abuses. This measure not only complies with Article 10 of the current import and export trade regulations, which stipulates that the Management Committee may, based on the circumstances, directly allocate quotas to the manufacturers of each industry, but also takes into account the rights and interests of the rolling mills. As for the aluminum ingot quota for foil manufacturing, the import quota allocation department of the Management Committee has thoroughly researched it and handed it over to Hualu Steel Refinement Factory for application and supply. According to the Hualu factory, the average monthly sale of aluminum foil to Chinese cigarette factories is 1,500 boxes, which is sufficient to meet 70% of the industry's needs. According to its production volume, the foreign-owned Yizhong cigarette factory should receive 340 books per month, requiring a total of 81 tons of aluminum ingots. Adding foreign ports and small amounts of other uses, the total monthly amount is approximately 100 tons. The current quota is already not small. In addition, the value of aluminum foil items arriving at the port without a license, which are self-prepared foreign exchange goods, is approximately 2 million USD. The number of applicants for purchase is already not small, and the rest are also applying successively. The Hualu factory also received a fourth-quarter aluminum ingot quota for foil manufacturing of 71,500 USD. Therefore, the current source of aluminum foil is abundant, and there should be no problem with supply.

### Weakness of Chinese Stocks on the Weekend; Bulls Eager to Close Out Positions

Chinese stocks mostly moved sideways yesterday, but suddenly felt weak near noon. As the closing approached, many bulls felt unable to bear the burden and rushed to sell. Popular stocks ended the day lower, with only Rongfeng Underwear and Sino-French trending upwards. China United Building Material traded ex-rights and closed at the upper limit.

The market opened flat and weak. Wing On Spinning opened at $1,180 and $2,230. China United Cement resumed trading, opening at $220, and was eagerly bought, immediately reaching the upper limit, with demand still exceeding supply. Wing On Spinning rose from $1,137 and $1,128, with transactions immediately delivered by numbers 104, 35, and 141, and progressively delivered by numbers 76, 54, 16, 14, 206, 71, and 226, rising to $1,207 and $1,258. Numbers 36 sold spot deliveries, while numbers 61 and 12 made forward deliveries, and numbers 178, 12, and 228 closed spot deliveries, falling back to $1,177 and $1,225. Numbers 16, 14, 206, 183, 97, and 163 made forward deliveries, while numbers 104 and 218 made spot deliveries. News of the rumored shutdown of spinning and weaving mills boosted confidence, and prices rose again to highs of $1,215 and $1,263. At this point, underwear prices continued to rise, Rongfeng also saw strong profits, and Sino-French neared its upper limit. Numbers 16, 178, 65, 172, 76, 71, 183, 74, 206, 190, 213, and 36 rushed to sell forward deliveries, while numbers 131, 130, and 95 closed spot deliveries. Near noon, a widespread sell-off suddenly occurred, and Sino-French quickly fell back, with Wing On Spinning dropping to lows of $1,163 and $1,203. The noon closing was $1,164 and $1,204. As a result, compared to the previous closing, China United Building Material stock closed at the upper limit, Rongfeng Underwear and Sino-French each rose by 5%, China Silk rose slightly, Hengfeng, China Textile, and China Cement were unchanged, Wing On Spinning, American-Asia, Sino-Russian, Xinguang, Zhabei National Goods, Jingfu, Jinglun, Xinhua, China United, Tongyi, and Match each fell slightly, and Datong, Commerce, Lian'an, and Qinxing fell by 5%. Forward delivery stocks uniformly fell slightly. Among over-the-counter unlisted stocks, Dasheng and Culture stocks rose by about 5%, showing the strongest profits, while the rest were mediocre.

Xin Yi Pharmaceutical Factory has submitted the required documentation for its change of registration and will resume trading on March 8.

Jingfu Shirts and Socks will issue new shares starting March 10. Forward deliveries will begin on March 11, and spot deliveries on March 16, with settlement in shares.

### Absorption by Out-of-Town Merchants; Cotton Yarn Market Firm

Yesterday's cotton yarn market had already risen for several consecutive days, seemingly reaching its peak. Out-of-town merchants felt the prices were too high and their interest waned, so the market opened sideways. Later, due to favorable reports of yarn prices in other regions, absorption by both northern and southern merchants strengthened, and local merchants also began to buy, causing the market to immediately become firm.

The final 41 count Super Phoenix fine yarn rose by $100,000 compared to the previous day, to $130 million. Other counts of fine yarn also rose by 500,000 to 1.2 million.

Scattered Selling of Cloth Causes Slight Decline

Yesterday's cotton cloth market initially opened with slightly lower asking prices due to tight credit and a soft sentiment. However, those with ample funds immediately bought when they saw selling, and dyeing factories took advantage of the lower prices to absorb inventory, sparking a buying spree and causing the market to immediately become firm.

For 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth, absorption by both northern and southern merchants was very strong due to rising exchange rates, and prices soared at one point. Near the close, scattered sellers took profits and sold at higher prices, resulting in a return of 12,000 to 78,000 for each grade of fine cloth compared to the previous day. In addition, serge and straight tribute also fell by 80,000, while printed cloth and 190 Shilin cloth rose by 100,000 to 200,000 due to rising labor and material costs for manufacturers of brands such as Meiting Chick and Yitong. Fine twill and coarse cloth remained stable.

Factory Responsible for Consolidated Tax on Cotton Yarn

[Our report] Yesterday's report stated that the increased consolidated tax on cotton yarn stored in factories would not be borne by the factories. The Yarn Control Committee believes this information is inconsistent with the actual situation and telegraphed the Sixth District Guild to correct it. The Yarn Control Committee's telegram to the Sixth District Guild is recorded below: "To the Sixth District Cotton Textile Machinery Industry Association: Today's report regarding the issue of increased consolidated tax burden on spun cotton yarn without warehouse receipts states that the Association has proposed two suggestions that have been adopted by the Committee for implementation. Upon investigation, Chairman Wang of the Association presented his views to the Committee yesterday. Chairman Yuan of the Committee replied that the case had been resolved by the Fourth Committee Meeting and could not be easily changed. If the Association has other sufficient reasons, it may submit a written request for reconsideration. The discussion yesterday proceeded as described above. The report is inconsistent with the facts and should be corrected by the Association to avoid misunderstandings."

### Customs Limits Confiscation of Goods Arriving at Port to Date of Shipment

[Our report] On March 5, this newspaper reported that the Municipal Import and Export Commercial Association expressed opposition to the Customs' method of handling goods shipped without permits after October 1, 1947. The Jianghai Customs Department sent a letter explaining the following: "(1) The Import and Export Commercial Association claims that the Customs will confiscate goods shipped before October 1, 1947, but arriving at the port after October 1, 1947, which is inconsistent with the facts. Customs Announcement No. 187 clearly stipulates that the date of shipment is the limit and is not related to the date of arrival at the port.

(2) Customs has no way of knowing the date of shipment of goods arriving at the port unless the merchant submits the relevant bill of lading and invoice together with the customs declaration. Therefore, for goods shipped before October 1, 1947, but arriving at the port after October 1, 1947, if the relevant bill of lading and invoice are not submitted within fifteen days from the date of Customs Announcement No. 187, the Customs will not be able to know the date of shipment and may issue a notice of disposition in accordance with the new method.

(3) After receiving the above notice, if the merchant's goods were indeed shipped before October 1, 1947, they may, in accordance with the provisions of the notice, submit a written statement of objection together with the documents within fifteen days. The Customs will consider this and will not confiscate goods arriving at the port without permits after October 1, 1947, regardless of the date of shipment."

### Payment for Last Year's Tea Cargoes Can Be Cleared Within a Month and a Half

The Farmer's Bank's pledged tea cargoes from last year that have not been repaid have been specially approved by the United Four Banks for public auction. The Farmer's Bank implemented the first auction on January 21 of this year, but the amount auctioned was not large, only a little over a thousand boxes of Pinglu, Qihong, and green tea. The bank originally planned to hold a second auction, but later, in consideration of the difficulties of tea merchants, the tea could still be redeemed with funds before the second auction was scheduled. The bank believes that this pledged loan has been delayed for too long and should be concluded as soon as possible, so it notified all tea merchants to redeem all of it and complete the procedures by the 15th of this month, otherwise the second auction will be held. Recently, tea prices have improved, and tea merchants have been rushing to the bank to complete the procedures. As of now, less than 4,000 boxes of tea have not been redeemed, and the outstanding loan is only about 3 billion. The tea merchants can repay all of it before the 15th of this month, and last year's tea loan can be concluded within the month.

### Export Industry Provides Suggestions to Improve Industrial Loans

[Our report] The authorities are currently considering opening up industrial and commercial loans as soon as possible. In view of the past government's handling of export loans, which has not been perfect, the municipal export industry has gathered opinions from the industry to provide to the authorities for reference: (1) Target: Should cover all general commodities. Limiting it to a few commodities such as tung oil, raw silk, tea, bristles, and egg products would be unfair and would lose the meaning of promoting exports. (2) Amount: Previously, each loan was limited to 500 million yuan. If this limit was exceeded, special approval was required. With the current high prices, large amounts of funds are needed. It is proposed that the loan amount be declared by the exporter, based on the amount of foreign exchange that can be exchanged for the exported goods within a specified period (assumed to be three months). The lending national bank and bureau can investigate and approve it. (3) Term: The loan term should vary depending on the exported goods, based on the actual time required for purchase, sorting, packaging, refining, or transportation. The total term should be extended to six months, and packing loans should be extended to three months. (4) Collateral: Export goods need to be processed and sorted after purchase and before export, making it difficult to store them in warehouses. It is recommended to adopt a bank credit guarantee method. If the guaranteeing bank insists on using real estate as collateral, commodity securities or other real estate can be used. (5) Interest rate: Should maintain the original method, not exceeding 3% per month. However, if an exporter uses a low-interest loan for purposes other than export, or if the amount of foreign exchange earned from exports is less than the declared amount, the lending national bank and bureau may cancel the eligibility for the next loan application or impose a fine. (6) Other: In secondary trading ports without branches of national banks and bureaus, exporters should be allowed to choose a favorable location to handle export loan procedures. Exporters should be given convenience in remitting funds when they need to remit funds to purchase goods.

### Silk Prices Fluctuate Upwards

The artificial silk market fluctuated upwards yesterday, eventually rising 8 million more than the upper day. The highest price for 120 Asahi silk in the morning was 62 million, and the lowest was 57 million. The highest price in the afternoon reached 67.5 million, and the final selling price was 5 million. The factory price rose slightly again yesterday, but trading was very quiet on Saturday, with asking prices for all grades rising by 5 million to 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day. No 5-dan lots were traded, and only two or three dan of retail lots were traded. The high retail price was 95 million yuan, and the intermediate retail price was around 3 million yuan.

The silk market continued to rise yesterday. Huaqiang True Silk was sold at around 3.4 million yuan at the open, fluctuated for a long time, and rose to 3.8 million yuan at the close, up 1.2 million for Monday. Dacheng Checkered Crepe closed at 311,000 yuan, up 6,000 yuan from the previous day. Lin Ji Wax Feather Yarn was 140,000 yuan, and Minsheng Jingfang Ni was 400,000 yuan. Both local and out-of-town merchants had an appetite for them.

Tea Market Rebounds

The tea market trend remains sharp. However, the market sentiment was somewhat discouraged at the open because it was heard that the Tianjin merchants were only offering around 4 million yuan per dan for Shaoxing fried tea in 1947, and still had an appetite. Fortunately, the market's inventory was almost exhausted, and the market quickly rebounded. Other teas were also favored by buyers, and prices remained firm.

Wood Prices Firm

Yesterday's wood market continued to trend upwards due to rumors of the opening of free foreign exchange. Retail sales in various shops were not weak, and the building merchants' interest was moving. Unfortunately, the inventory was insufficient, making the market feel sharper. Foreign pine squares rose to 53,000 yuan per foot, ordinary pieces were 52,000 yuan, and 5-fen pine planks were also up to 900,000 yuan per zhang. 36-foot Lauan plywood was 330,000 yuan per sheet. 3-foot sheets were sold for 380,000 yuan. The price of fir also followed suit, with large strips selling for 11,500 yuan per foot and small strips selling for 11,000 yuan, rising by about 20% compared to the previous day.

### Rubber Overshoes Rise in Price

The rubber overshoe market has seen repeated adjustments in factory prices due to the rising cost of living and labor expenses for manufacturers. The wholesale market for fellow merchants has also risen sharply. In addition, the rainy season sales in both local and out-of-town markets have been activated, and those coming to Shanghai to purchase goods have a strong appetite. Double Coin brand round-mouth men's overshoes are now selling for 1.87 million per dozen, women's Tianzu shoes are 1.45 million, Dai Ping boots are 2.75 million, Huili long boots are 9.6 million, and special sneakers are 4.25 million. Other goods such as Arrow, Drum, Great Happiness, and Great China have also risen by 20% to 30% compared to the previous day.

Along the path where the new hearse carrying Gandhi passed, passers-by all prostrated themselves. The death of the Founding Father of India was extremely tragic.

After the cremation of Gandhi's body, his son (right) Taivei Da Gandhi personally supervised the executioners and others to put the ashes into urns and take them to the Ganges River for burial.

At the cremation ground on the banks of the Jumna River in New Delhi, Nehru and his party performed three Hindu rites after the cremation of Gandhi's body.

On February 12, a landing craft carried Gandhi's ashes and slowly sailed into the Ganges River. The ashes of Gandhi were spread throughout the river amidst ten thousand heads in motion.

### Teahouse Literature

— Jing Wen

I have been in Shanghai for many years, and I have occasionally visited teahouses and cafes, but I always feel that their flavor is far inferior to the small teahouses in the countryside of the mainland. Perhaps because I am already out of date, I can no longer "catch up" with modern and advanced things. However, the village-style teahouse, compared to the new-style teahouses and cafes in the city, is indeed full of human touch.

In the village teahouse, the relationship between the owner and the tea drinkers is not just a buying and selling relationship. The owner is sometimes a tea drinker. He will sit down and talk to you about business, talk about hard times, and chat idly. You will never be given the cold shoulder by the waiter for sitting there too long. Sometimes the waiter will also answer a sentence or two, making you feel that this place is full of simple human kindness and friendship.

If you are a regular, you don't have to pay cash immediately after drinking the tea. The tea you brewed in the morning can still be drunk in the afternoon. And among the tea drinkers, there are familiar faces everywhere. Although you don't have to greet everyone, if you are happy to greet someone, you will surely find an opponent to talk to you. The village teahouse is really an indispensable social place.

The life of a "teahouse" may be a bit of a waste of life, but the true village teahouse, most of the tea drinkers are barefoot people who steal a little leisure from their busy lives. Except for a few gentry gentlemen or shop owners in the town, there are not many people who hatch in the teahouse all day long. During the busy farming season, it is rare to see one or two idlers. This is quite different from the situation in urban teahouses and cafes, where there is constant coming and going all day long.

I have occasionally seen people criticize the current cultural world for only having pornographic literature and "teahouse literature." I know about pornographic literature, but I was quite at a loss at first as to what teahouse literature refers to. Then I thought, it probably refers to a generation of articles that specialize in writing about leisure and trivial matters around them. Because this kind of thing, in the eyes of those who are ideologically progressive, is like the village teahouse, completely a waste, so it is called teahouse literature.

If I guessed correctly, I would like to say a few words for teahouse literature.

I think the name teahouse literature is not bad, at least not worse than the urban "tea room literature" or "coffee literature" of the new romantic school. Because although teahouse literature doesn't pay much attention to "serious spirit," it is ultimately a manifestation of human emotion. This is just like the barefoot people in the village teahouse talking about everything. Although it is inevitably vulgar, it is ultimately a genuine expression of emotion. And as far as I know, sincere emotion is one of the basic conditions of all literature and art.

For example, now a generation of poets are shouting that they should "learn from" a certain poet. Why should they "learn from" this poet? It is simply because the "mountain songs" sung by this poet can draw more material from folk ballads. In other words, it is because this kind of poetry has some human touch. Even illiterate villagers can understand a few sentences. In fact, this kind of poetry should also belong to teahouse literature.

If teahouse literature only refers to things like idle talk and gossip, I don't think there is anything wrong with it. Because this kind of article may not make a big contribution to the world and people's hearts, but it is ultimately harmless to people's hearts. Language and writing are nothing more than tools for people to express their own perceptions. Some people like to write with morals and express their ambitions with poetry, and write many meaningful works, which is naturally worthy of admiration. But because I like this kind of article, I classify others' as just teahouse literature, then I am inevitably too narrow-minded.

We have heard a lot about the voice of public opinion, but if we were to say that there is any real public opinion institution in the Chinese countryside, I am afraid we should recommend the small teahouses in remote mountain villages. Although the villagers' wild talk in the small teahouse cannot be fully believed, they are ultimately words between people. They are rough, but they are full of true feelings, and sometimes they do not lack true insights.

Teahouse literature is also like this. Although the people who write this kind of thing do not have a ready-made theory as a model, as long as they write what they want to say, no one can object to them. In the past, someone advocated miscellaneous essays, isn't that what it meant? If miscellaneous essays can only be of one kind, then what is there to "miscellaneous" about?

### On Relationships

— Jin Jin

Nowadays (in fact, it has been the same in ancient times), everything is inseparable from all kinds of relationships. Scholars who study literature are either called political relationships, economic relationships, or social relationships, historical relationships. Many people who pay attention to practical benefits pay more attention to interpersonal relationships, hometown relationships... and so on, such as cronyism, which are regarded as a stepping stone to advancement. Some experts in the United States have even written books such as "Customer Relationships" and "International Trade Relations," which are magnificent and thought-provoking.

Secondly, in terms of what we have seen and heard in the world, we occasionally go to a company to visit a friend, and find that the person in charge is a handsome young man, while the old and prudent people are instead driven by him. After inquiring again, we find that this gentleman is the son of a wealthy merchant, and we are speechless.

Let's take the Hull Memoirs published in this newspaper as an example. A few days ago, it was writing about the tense moments before and after the outbreak of the Pearl Harbor war. With Hull's rich experience and deep experience, he was the only one who could not participate in President Roosevelt's military meetings. On the contrary, Roosevelt Jr.'s official position was far below Hull, but he could always be by his side. All the historical materials that Hull could not collect or see were easily obtained by Roosevelt Jr. There is no other reason, but that President Roosevelt is his father.

When we see people who are good at using relationships in the world, they are successful in everything. In small things, such as buying things, they can get discounts, and they can get distribution goods or pay fees without queuing... In big things, such as getting rich and getting promoted, they are all in it. According to various European and American countries, which are known to the world for their high work efficiency, their "obtaining the greatest harvest with the least effort" can only be said to those who are "good at using relationships" in our country.

A certain Hollywood playwright once created the character of Samuel in his writing, which is a typical example of this kind of person. Samuel came from a poor background, and used his cunning and wit to make full use of all kinds of opportunities and relationships, from a newspaper boy to a newspaper trainee, and then to the editor of a "radio column." From then on, he sailed smoothly, stealing other people's scripts, and got promoted to a Hollywood director. He waved a thick cigar in one hand, and many strict doors in society were opened by him. Later, he was lucky enough to marry the daughter of a wealthy producer, and the dowry included a luxurious and spacious villa, and he could also obtain the management rights of a large film company. Samuel felt arrogant and invincible, but on his wedding night, he discovered that his wife was having an affair with a certain movie actor. After his desires were satisfied, what followed was disappointment. From the perspective of focusing on relationships, this seems to be a disappointing ending.

### Wandering Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter Twelve: Fleeting Marriage (90)

After Qi Wan went to the hospital for bowel cleansing and taking medicine, the gold ring she swallowed was discharged in a few hours. Because she was deeply stimulated, her spirit was very weak, so she stayed in the hospital. Xiao He believed that this unexpected disturbance was related to the reputation of the family, and ordered all the servants that if someone came to visit the boss, just say that she was in the hospital due to illness, and do not tell them which hospital. Although Xiao He wanted to keep it a secret, the people below were quick-tongued. The news spread out in twos and threes. The general tabloids thought it was fresh material and exaggerated it greatly. In less than two days, the whole city was talking about it, and everyone knew about it. Zhu Zhai read the news in the newspaper and rushed to Qi Wan's house to inquire about Wang Ma. Wang Ma believed that Zhu Zhai was different from others, and told him everything about the discussion. Zhu Zhai was very angry when he heard that Director Miao had threatened with a gun, and also felt that Qi Wan's encounter was very pitiful. He rushed to Xishiku Hospital to inquire, but the hospital, at Qi Wan's request, would not receive any guests who came to look for her. Therefore, Zhu Zhai went several times, but could not meet Qi Wan. Zhu Zhai was so anxious that he could only write a letter to inquire, but there was no reply. It turned out that after suffering this stimulation, Qi Wan felt that her face was too ugly, especially that she could not see Zhu Zhai again. Currently, Zhu Zhai did not know the inside story, and she inevitably felt jealous and resentful in her heart. If they met again and knew the reason, it would be even more difficult to deal with, so every day, except for Wang Ma and Xiao Jiu to visit her, talked a few words, and the rest of the time, she stayed alone in the sick room, quietly reading novels to pass the time. Sometimes she walked out of the room, on the corridor, breathing air. Although she felt depressed in her heart, she was unwilling to leave the hospital, because once she went out, seeing her relatives and friends, her face would be too ugly. Qi Wan stayed in the hospital for a week to avoid shame. This day, at dusk, she came out of the room, on the corridor, leaning on the railing, staring blankly at the flower garden in the hospital. She saw two crows calling mournfully on an ancient locust tree. After calling a few times, they flew south together. In this hazy twilight, these few cries of crows were sent to her ears, desolate and moving. Qi Wan stared blankly at the end of the sky. The pair of crows had already flown away without a trace. She felt very sad in her heart, feeling that the tired birds knew to return. Like this pair of flying crows, they still had a home to go to when the day was late and the weather was cold. She herself had been struggling in the art circle since she was a teenager, and she did not know how many storms and changes she had experienced. To this day, she still had no way to go. What she had idealized in the past had become an illusion today, and none of the hopes she had held had been able to be achieved.

### Ling Xiaohan Pavilion's Recent Collection

— Half-Dream Old Man

Regarding Ling Xiaohan Pavilion, most people know that he is well-versed in both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign texts, but few know that he also possesses a unique discernment for collecting bronze and stone antiques. I remember that this year in the cold stalls of Beiping City, he encountered a descendant of an old family who was offering an ancient inkstone for sale. Upon careful examination, it was indeed the old object of Weng Tanxi, one of the four great calligraphers of the Qing Dynasty. Tanxi's calligraphy is square, upright, meticulous, and strict, capable of incorporating the clerical style into the regular script. In the entire Qing Dynasty, only this old man could directly approach the Jin and Tang styles. The inkstone is about four inches long, one inch thick, and three inches wide, made of green-skinned roof tiles from the Shu Palace. Its color is deep, elegant, and beautiful, possessing the charm of ancient antiquity. On its edge is engraved Tanxi's inkstone inscription, which reads: "Mossy flowers collect emerald, ink traces congeal jasper, a piece of tile from the Shu Palace, may it last ten thousand years." A total of sixteen characters. At the end is signed "Tanxi, the Old Man." Observing its brushstrokes, which are ancient and vigorous, and its rhythm, which is condensed and refined, it is indeed the old man's masterpiece in life. After Ling Xiaohan Pavilion collected it, he sent a rubbing to me on the sea. I wrote a poem on it, saying: "Tanxi the Old Man's Ouyang Xun script, square and sharp, bright as jade, the Shu Palace tile inkstone exhales clouds, wielding the brush freely and naturally; mossy jade ink traces remain from ancient times, deeply carved and lightly engraved, the form is relaxed, the sixteen characters are cherished, a generation of extraordinary writing is sorted out. The old man has long disappeared into the desolate hills, relics are scattered, with no place to store them, who is the possessor Ling Xiao Xu, an inch of field, a foot of house to offer cultivation. The text is majestic, soaring in widespread praise, a paper rubbing remotely sent to me. Deep, elegant and bright, it illuminates my humble dwelling, making my mood directly enter the early Tang Dynasty, placing it on my right side like a jade pendant, a thousand years, ten thousand rituals, the spirit coincides."

He also acquired a Shuoping Prefecture seal in Changdian. Shuoping is located in the northern part of Shanxi Province, leaning against the Great Wall, serving as an important town controlling the border. He sent a rubbing of the seal, which he himself inscribed with a poem: "Two generations of Qi territory, a hundred-mile marquis, ashamed of no seal to continue the former cultivation, a copper talisman in hand is truly a wonderful encounter, obtaining this is no different from governing a prefecture." He added a note: "My ancestor, Mr. Weihou, entered the Jinshi through his name and governed Shandong. My father, Mr. Ziyi, also entered the Shandong officialdom as a Juren. Therefore, it is said that two generations governed Qi Province. I still remember when Mr. Weihou was taking the provincial examination in the Dingwei year of Daoguang, the essay was already completed, but suddenly he heard moaning from the next cubicle. Lifting the curtain to inquire, it turned out to be Li Hongzhang, the Grand Secretary of Hefei, whose essay was only partially completed and was too ill to continue. Mr. Wei asked to see it and determined that it would surely pass, so he helped to complete it and submitted the paper together. That year, both became Jinshi. From then on, their interactions became increasingly close. However, Mr. Wei did not rely on his power, but remained an official who cared for the people. After retiring from office, he served as the head of the Jintai Academy. His family's success in the imperial examinations continued without interruption. Zhi Jing Shirang, and the two historians Yanfu and Yingfu, all enjoyed a good reputation at the time. My friend Jingzhai followed the rhyme and harmonized, saying: "A thousand poems are lighter than ten thousand households of marquises, a hundred cities of books embrace spiritual cultivation, suddenly obtaining a valuable copper talisman, a magnificent hall houses Kyushu." I wrote on his rubbing: "The yellow hall of the five horses, a sixth-rank official, an empty name also fills the scholar's meal, but look at the piled-up copper talismans held, already sighing at the sound of the jade tree's remnants. How can phoenixes truly dwell in thorns, essays must rise from waves. Knowing you possess the responsibility of a prefecture, you don't need the art of Chu and the hat of Gongyu." Obtaining a seal is not unusual, but obtaining a prefectural seal is unusual. Obtaining an official seal as a scholar is even more unusual. What in the world is not a child's play? Official seals were of great importance at the time, but with the passage of time and changes in the world, they are not worth a penny. But then, is being an official not the same? Can the awe-inspiring things that the ancients spoke of last forever?

In addition to obtaining the Shuoping Prefecture seal, he also obtained the Ningjin County School official seal, and also sent a rubbing to me. He also inscribed a poem: "This is the bean curd official of the past, leftover wine and cold food are poor and humble, but now bean curd is as precious as gold, let's seek ancient joy with copper seals." He added a note: "School officials used to be called 'bean curd officials', but now each piece of bean curd costs 10,000 national currency." Taking Shanghai as an example, a large piece of bean curd is already worth more than 20,000 yuan. The rise in prices is truly endless. My friend Jingzhai also followed the original rhyme and harmonized, saying: "The copper seal serves as an old scholar's official, the taste is like trying alfalfa acid, enviable are the scholar's livelihood, the palace wall allows a family's joy." Scholars have no way to make a living. If they could indeed get the salary of a Qing Dynasty school teacher, have a school palace to live in with their families, and have school fields to harvest, what wouldn't they be happy to do? I also wrote a chapter: "A paper official like Zheng Guangwen, wandering in Hebei, already empty of followers, the title of alfalfa can also兼 taste, the mind of artemisia awaits meritorious service; holding the copper bell, boasting of treasure and value, wielding the vermilion ink, moving the wind and clouds, now the Ding and Wu sacrifices are gone, when will the chewing of large meat be satisfied?" School teachers can only feast on sacrificial meat during the grand ceremonies of the Ding and Wu sacrifices.

He also wrote at the end of the two papers: "In the Wuzi year, I traveled to Changdian and obtained a prefectural seal and a Confucian academy copper seal. They were all hidden possessions of treacherous families. After their property was confiscated, their families sold them due to poverty, and after being resold by hawkers, they entered the market and came to me. In the past, old seals sold in Ping City were mostly from the Zuoling of various banners. Local official seals are generally prohibited from being sold, so these two seals were secretly transferred out, which can be said to be unprecedented. Confucian academies were formerly called 'bean curd officials' because they were extremely poor and humble. Apart from the gifts from scholars and the rent from school fields, there was no other income. They couldn't afford meat dishes, and only on the day of the Ding sacrifice could they share the sacrificial meat, which was more than the county magistrate, which could be used for a big feast. Someone once used a couplet to joke about it, saying: 'Sweeping snow, call the boy, don't recognize today's roll call; thundering to invite guests, know that yesterday's sacrifice was Ding.'" The description is vivid and realistic, so it is not abusive. Mr. Aitang, the respected father of Yin Tai from my Yizhou, once served as a school official in Haizhou and also served as the River Supervisor Dao Rong. He obtained the school official position from the Daoguang Jiyou tribute student and rose to the position of Eastern River Governor-General, all of whom had tasted the flavor of alfalfa." Although school officials are poor and humble, they are always sought after by people who "look clean, lofty, deep, and stable." The officialdom is full of storms, but school officials have none. The bitterness lies in this, and the happiness also lies in this.

### No Fear of Wind or Rain

— Pingzhai

When the famous American general O'Donnell was the commander of a joint team in Michigan, there was a good piece of grass in front of his office building. He sent an old sergeant, who had experienced many battles, to be responsible for watering it every day. As soon as the sergeant received the order, he immediately sent a soldier and told him to water it once every afternoon at three o'clock.

One day, there was a heavy thunderstorm. The old sergeant was inspecting the barracks and saw the soldier responsible for watering was sleeping.

The sergeant was furious and said, "It's three o'clock now, why aren't you watering!"

The soldier pleaded, saying, "But, sir, it's raining so hard!"

The sergeant's anger did not diminish. He shouted, "What does it matter if it rains! Don't you have a raincoat?" Jin Lin

### Freedom

— Jinlin

The freedom of a country is often maintained for thousands of years, but lost in a single morning. — Burke

True freedom is in enjoying one's own rights, not infringing on the rights of others. — Pinkard

Freedom will not be bestowed upon us, we must strive to obtain it; freedom is a kind of enjoyment, but it must be obtained with considerable effort. — Montesquieu

### Rambling on Mencius

— Wu Yong

There was a period—it seems to be around the time of the Northern Expedition—when leaders in cultural circles strongly opposed students reading ancient books, and a small number expressed approval, but their voice was not strong, and it was not in line with the atmosphere at the time. Finally, apart from being treasured by antiquarians, ancient books became very unfashionable, retreating to a corner of culture that people did not pay attention to or value. The book of Mencius is one of them.

In the past, scholars listed the Four Books as essential reading, starting from "Confucius said" and "The Book of Poetry." I guess these books had a significant impact on Chinese culture. Some say that the benevolence and righteousness advocated by Confucius and his followers seem to have never been practiced in China, and ten people who read it are no better than those who have never read it. But it must be known that if people in the past did not read the books of Confucius and Mencius, things might have been worse, and it is also not necessarily.

In my personal opinion, ancient books are not unworthy of reading, but they should not be read too early. Taking the book of Mencius as an example, I once read it thoroughly under the supervision of the "old-fashioned teacher," and it can be said that I read it so well that I could recite it. As for understanding, I can't say that I didn't understand it at all, but I always felt that the words in this book were very ordinary, and even if they were not said, I already knew them, so I thought it was very pedantic. So, when I read Mencius at that time, it was like Mencius playing the lute to a cow, and I felt nothing in my heart and was not moved. Instead, I loved to read books that were far from reality, such as Lao Tzu and Zhuang Tzu. After the age of thirty, when I read Mencius again, it was like seeing a new thing, and my eyes lit up. It felt like the ancient poem "The pomegranate flowers in May shine brightly," and the more I read it, the more fresh and delightful it became, and it was endlessly beautiful, like a village after village in a dark willow and bright flowers.

Someone said: When it comes to democracy, Mencius is more democratic than today's people. The "kingly way" that Mencius advocated, as opposed to hegemony, seems mysterious, but in fact it is "benevolent governance." "Benevolent governance" is nothing more than a political system that puts the interests of the people first. The slogan of the "kingly way" is: "Heaven sees as my people see, Heaven hears as my people hear." In today's words, this is to emphasize "public opinion." Starting from this major premise, he said: "When a ruler promotes the worthy, it is unavoidable that he will cause the lowly to surpass the noble and the distant to surpass the close. Should he not be cautious? If those on the left and right all say he is worthy, that is not enough; if the senior officials all say he is worthy, that is not enough; if the people of the country all say he is worthy, then investigate him. If you see that he is truly worthy, then use him." This is very similar to today's "universal suffrage system." When a ruler promotes the worthy, it is permissible for the lowly to surpass the noble and the distant to surpass the close, which means not employing private individuals. Mencius also said: "If those on the left and right all say he is unfit, do not listen to them; if the senior officials all say he is unfit, do not listen to them; if the people of the country all say he is unfit, then investigate him. If you see that he is truly unfit, then remove him." This is today's "right of recall." He also said: "If those on the left and right all say he should be killed, do not listen to them; if the senior officials all say he should be killed, do not listen to them; if the people of the country all say he should be killed, then investigate him. If you see that he should be killed, then kill him. Therefore, it is said: 'The people of the country killed him.'" This method seems to be a step further than today's judicial "jury system."

During the time when the spirit of democracy had not yet prevailed, China and other countries in the world regarded the emperor, the ruler of a country, with mysterious respect, to the point of being sacred and inviolable. But Mencius had long believed that it was permissible to kill a monarch who brought disaster to the country and harmed the people: "King Xuan of Qi asked: 'Tang banished Jie, and King Wu attacked Zhou. Is there such a thing?' Mencius replied: 'There is such a thing in the records.' The king said: 'Is it permissible for a subject to kill his ruler?' Mencius said: 'One who injures benevolence is called a robber, and one who injures righteousness is called a destroyer. A person who is both a robber and a destroyer is called a solitary man. I have heard of the execution of the solitary man Zhou, but I have not heard of the killing of a ruler.' Mencius said to King Xuan of Qi: 'If one of your ministers entrusts his wife and children to a friend and goes to travel in Chu, and when he returns, his wife and children are starving and cold, what should be done?' The king said: 'Abandon him.' Mencius said: 'If the officers are unable to govern the soldiers, what should be done?' The king said: 'Dismiss them.' Mencius said: 'If the country within the four borders is not well-governed, what should be done?' The king looked to the left and right and spoke of other things." The people can use the right of recall against the ruler of a country. If he still refuses to step down, the people can kill him. This is Mencius's ideal.

In Mencius's mind, the monarch is merely a member of the division of labor, a link in the communication and exchange of affairs. The laborer provides a portion of the harvest of his labor to the monarch who labors with his mind. The monarch labors with his mind and worries his spirit, seeking happiness for the people and eliminating disasters, so that the laborer can peacefully engage in his work. This can also be said to be: "Trade and retire, each getting what he wants." Emperors and monarchs are not inherently sacred or great. Therefore, Mencius knew how to respect himself in front of kings: "Mencius was about to go to court, and the king sent someone to say: 'I would like to see you, but I have a cold and cannot be exposed to the wind. Tomorrow I will go to court. I don't know if I can see you?' Mencius replied: 'Unfortunately, I have an illness and cannot go to court.' The next day, he went to offer condolences at the home of Dongguo. Gongsun Chou said: 'Yesterday you were ill, but today you are offering condolences. Is this not improper?' Mencius said: 'Yesterday I was ill, but today I am better. Why should I not offer condolences?' The king sent someone to inquire about his illness. The doctor came. Meng Zhongzi replied: 'Yesterday I had a royal command, and I had the worry of gathering firewood and could not go to court. Now my illness is slightly better, and I am rushing to go to court. I don't know if I can get there.' He sent several people to wait on the road, saying: 'Please do not return, but go to court.' He had no choice but to stay overnight at the home of Jing Chou. Jingzi said: 'Internally, there are fathers and sons; externally, there are rulers and ministers. These are the great human relations. Fathers and sons value kindness, and rulers and ministers value respect. I have seen the king's respect for you, but I have not seen you respect the king.' Mencius said: 'Alas, what are you saying? The people of Qi do not speak to the king of benevolence and righteousness. Is it because they do not think benevolence and righteousness are beautiful? In their hearts, they say: "Is he worthy of being spoken to about benevolence and righteousness?" Then there is no greater disrespect than this. If it is not the way of Yao and Shun, I would not dare to present it before the king. Therefore, no one in Qi respects the king as much as I do.' Jingzi said: 'No, that is not what I mean. The Book of Rites says: "When a father calls, do not refuse. When a ruler commands, do not wait for the carriage." You were going to go to court, but when you heard the king's command, you changed your mind. This seems to be inconsistent with the rites.' Mencius said: 'What are you talking about? Zengzi said: "The wealth of Jin and Chu cannot be matched, but they rely on their wealth, and I rely on my benevolence. They rely on their rank, and I rely on my righteousness. Why should I be dissatisfied?" If it were not righteous, Zengzi would not have said it. This is probably one way. There are three universally respected things: rank, age, and virtue. In the court, there is nothing like rank; in the village, there is nothing like age; in helping the world and fearing the people, there is nothing like virtue. How can one neglect the other two because of one?' Therefore, a ruler who intends to achieve great things must have ministers who he does not summon. If he wants to consult with them, he will go to them. If he does not respect virtue and delight in the Way, he is not worth achieving great things with. Therefore, Tang learned from Yi Yin before making him his minister, so he became king without effort. Duke Huan of Qi learned from Guan Zhong before making him his minister, so he became hegemon without effort. Today, the land and virtue of the world are equal, and no one can surpass the other. There is no other reason than that they like to make their teachers their ministers, but they do not like to make their students their ministers. Tang did not dare to summon Yi Yin, and Duke Huan did not dare to summon Guan Zhong. Guan Zhong was already someone who could not be summoned, let alone someone who is not like Guan Zhong!'" This speech is so backbone-filled, yet so out of touch with the times. If Mencius were alive today, would he be "sprouting bean sprouts"?

### News of Anti-Japanese War Soldiers is Unknown—A Septuagenarian Mother is Forced to Appeal

Inquiring about the survival of Ying Fuquan

My son, Ying Fuquan, is from Yingjia Village outside the South Gate of Cixi, Ningbo. He enlisted in the army in November 1939, at the age of 27. It was not until August 1941 that he sent back a letter, stating that he was serving as a platoon leader in the 147th Regiment in Shangrao, Jiangxi. In December of the same year, another letter came, stating that he had been promoted from platoon leader to company commander. At that time, the situation in central Hunan was urgent, and he was transferred to Changsha to defend the city and was promoted to battalion commander. Later, he was transferred to Yunnan for operations, serving as the auxiliary battalion commander of the 73rd Regiment of the 190th Division of the Third Army. Since then, there has been no news. He left behind his unfortunate mother, who is over 70 years old, and an even more unfortunate daughter-in-law, who have depended on each other for the past nine years and have suffered unspeakable hardships. We hoped that the anti-Japanese war would be won and that the soldiers would return to their hometowns. Unexpectedly, three years after the victory, there is still no news. Currently, the war is still going on, and conscription is still taking place in the countryside. The local township office has even denied that we are family members of soldiers and ordered us to pay various fees. I am over 70 years old and suffering from illness and poverty. I rely solely on my widowed daughter-in-law to do needlework to make a living, and we are on the verge of starvation. Now, because the township is forcing us to pay, we have sold our possessions and come to Shanghai to look for my son. If any of my son Fuquan's old friends know of his whereabouts, please have pity on our suffering and send us a letter to inform us. We also implore the Ministry of National Defense to investigate and provide proof to avoid the various hardships in the countryside. Your kindness will be equivalent to a second life! Weeping, Ying Miao, the sufferer. Correspondence address: Hu Jinfatransfers Shanghai, Yuyao Road 946.
