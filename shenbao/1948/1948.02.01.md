### Gandhi's Death is a World Tragedy; Chairman Sends Telegram to Nehru Condoling; Luo Jialun Sends Condolences on His Behalf

This generation of sacred fighters advocating non-violence to achieve human peace was brutally murdered by violence, which is truly a world tragedy and heartbreaking. The Chinese people and we respectfully extend our sincere condolences to Your Excellency and the family of Mr. Gandhi, the Congress Party, and the Indian people. Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling". Note: Chairman Chiang and his wife met with Gandhi on September 18, 1942, and had a pleasant conversation for the entire afternoon until midnight, which was the longest time the Chairman had ever met with any individual.

### Prayer Meeting at the Indian Embassy; Chargé d'Affaires Ismail Reads Memorial Speech

"We Wish to Follow His Path to Reach Our Destination" [Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 31st] A reporter visited the Indian Embassy at 5:00 PM and saw Mrs. Menon, the ambassador's wife, leading the singing of elegies in the hall. Chargé d'Affaires Ismail and Menon's secretary all wore expressions of sorrow and mourned the great father of their country, who had suffered such a great loss, in a low voice. At about 6:00 PM, Indians in Nanjing gathered in the embassy hall, about eighty men and women, barefoot and sitting cross-legged. A long table was set up in front of the hall, on which an oil painting of Gandhi wearing a white shirt was enshrined. In front of the portrait, there was a pair of red candles and five white candles. First, a radio was borrowed to listen to the broadcast from Delhi. At 6:30 PM (4:00 PM Delhi time), when the ceremony for the cremation of Gandhi's remains began, a memorial prayer meeting began. First, four people stood up one after another and recited scriptures to the right of the table. Then, Chargé d'Affaires Ismail read a memorial speech, which roughly said: "Yesterday was the darkest day in Indian history. Today, the body of Mahatmaji (Gandhi's name) will return to the earth. Mahatmaji has passed away and will no longer lead his prayer ceremony. This is what we cannot believe, but it is true. It would be fortunate if he had not passed away, but he still had great work to do. Without him, we are like walking in the darkness. May those who know him deeply continue his will. This is not comforting, everything is lost. "The whole world is mourning for him. Only the greatness of Mahatmaji, I cannot reveal the mystery. We can only learn lessons from the outline of his life. Every breath of him is tuned to truth, and every word is harmonious and inseparable. Even today, if he were still here, he would be asked what he would do? He would not be unremittingly released from this assassination event, but only instruct us to continue his unfinished wishes; We follow the light he lit, and follow his path, until the final destination that he wants to take us to for life."

After Ismail finished his speech, everyone stood in silence. Then, four people went to the right side of the spirit table one after another to read eulogies or sing elegies, and clasped their hands together as a salute. Finally, the whole body beat the festival and sang an elegy, and dispersed in the atmosphere of solemnity. It was already 8:30, the night outside was heavier, and the wet and cold was pressing. The red, white, and green silk Indian flag was still statically half-hanging on the roof flagpole, and the Suolun, which symbolized Gandhi's spirit in the flag's center, was also obscured by darkness.

People of All Ethnic Groups Abandon Prejudices and Participate

The scriptures recited in the memorial service were those often recited by Gandhi during his lifetime prayers. In front of the altar, there were piles of Indian scriptures covered with brocade.

The Indian overseas Chinese who participated had no organization at the time, but the number of those who gathered without prior agreement was more than fifty, and Princess Samir of a certain Indian native state was also present.

### Zeng Qi Personally Writes Antithetical Couplet; Hu Shi Sends Telegram to Offer Condolences

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Zeng Qi, Chairman of the Youth Party and a member of the National Government, was deeply saddened when he heard the news of Gandhi's assassination while sick, and personally wrote an antithetical couplet: "The world admires Youlong, what kind of madman" only assassinates the saint! Dedicate oneself to feed tigers, bow one's head to worship this person all one's life." Zeng told reporters: He had great admiration for Gandhi. On Gandhi's birthday last year, he handed over his old work "Postscript to the Biography of Gandhi", written in official script, to Gandhi as a gift, which was forwarded by Indian Ambassador Menon.

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 31st] Hu Shi telegraphed the Indian Embassy in Nanjing on the 31st to express condolences to Gandhi, saying: "I feel deeply saddened by the death of Gandhi, which is an irreparable loss to the Indian people." Hu told reporters: "Gandhi's death will not increase the conflict between India and Pakistan, but may reduce and eliminate the crisis between India and Pakistan because of the appeal of Gandhi's great spirit." He said that Gandhi was a kind of magic. With his so thin and weak, he led India to independence, but only a nation with religious enthusiasm can produce Gandhi. May I ask which politician can use his own hunger strike as a political weapon? China cannot produce Gandhi. The Confucian and Mencian doctrines of two thousand years are still almost the same as what ordinary people say today. It can be said that they are very worldly and very different from the problems discussed by Indian philosophers. Finally, Hu commented that the success of Gandhi's non-violent doctrine lies in the law-abiding spirit of the Anglo-Saxon nation.

### Indian Students at Peking University; Held Evening Prayer Yesterday

### Estimated Payment System for Profit Tax; Difficult to Change in Fact; Person in Charge of the Direct Tax Department Speaks

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 31st] The profit tax for the 37th year will be collected on an estimated basis, six times the amount paid in the 36th year. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance's Direct Tax Department to request reconsideration. According to the person in charge of the Direct Tax Department, the method of collecting the profit tax on an estimated basis for the 37th year and collecting it at six times the amount paid in the 36th year have both been approved by the State Council, and it is impossible to change them in fact. According to price calculations, prices this year have risen by about 20 times compared to last year, and the income of merchants must also increase with prices. Calculating the estimated payment at six times is actually very reasonable. In terms of the profit tax budget, it was more than 900 billion yuan in the 36th year and 11.2 trillion yuan in the 37th year, which is also an increase of about 14 times. Therefore, it is impossible to reduce the estimated payment at six times. It is currently expected that the income from the profit tax before April of this year will be 4.5 trillion yuan, which is a considerable discount compared to the half-year profit tax budget of 5.6 trillion yuan this year. I sincerely hope that merchants can appreciate the current financial difficulties of the country, give their support, and prevent obstacles from occurring during implementation. According to estimates by the person in charge, if the estimated payment system can be successfully implemented in Shanghai, Shanghai alone can collect 3 trillion yuan, which can help reduce issuance a lot.

### Shenyang Mayor Jin Zhen Resigns

### Tianjin Cracks Down on Communist Bandit Organization

Head of Self-Defense Corps Secretly Serves as Communist Army "Procurement Director"; Principal Offender Arrested and Admits to Purchasing and Transporting Military Supplies for Bandits

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 31st] A major Communist bandit organization was recently cracked down in the suburbs of Tianjin. The principal offenders were Mu Chenglin, the head of the self-defense corps in Mu Zhuangzi and Tianqi Temple, and Mu Chengqing, the team leader, who used their positions to secretly serve as the procurement director in Tianjin for the Communist bandit's Jizhong Military Region. This was discovered by the Inspection Department of the Tianjin Garrison Command. On the 24th, Mu Chenglin was lured and arrested, and the entire self-defense corps was disarmed. All the principal offenders have now been escorted to the Peace Preservation Headquarters. According to the investigation by the Inspection Department, Mu Chenglin and others absorbed more than 20 procurement personnel in Tianjin and purchased goods in Tianjin by means of smuggling. Then, Mu Chengqing sent armed personnel to escort them to Mu Zhuangzi, and then transported them at night with more than 30 bicycles, escorted by armed personnel to Zhengyucheng in Anci County, and then transported them to the bandit areas such as Hejian. Later, they changed to transport them to Li Ming, the chief of the production section of the Communist bandit's Jizhong Military Region, 25 miles south of Anci County, and then transported them to the bandit areas. The goods transported were mostly mercury, electric money, batteries, radios, red phosphorus (raw material for making poisonous gas), etc. The home also sheltered important personnel of the traitors who were stationed there for command. On January 21st, it was reported that Mu Xiangqi, a child carrying explosives out of the country, was found in Zhongjia Gu, who was instructed by Mu Chenglin. With the evidence being confirmed, the department lured and arrested Mu Chenglin on the 24th. Mu Chenglin has admitted to purchasing military supplies for the traitors and sheltering the traitors to sneak into Tianjin and covering up the transportation of supplies out of the country. All the other accomplices have also revealed the truth. The Inspection Department is still stepping up its investigation.

### Major Corruption Case at the Shanghai Jianghai Customs; Corruption Part Sentenced in Nanjing; Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Yuan Sentenced to Death; Zhang Baohui Sentenced to Life Imprisonment

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 31st] The corruption part of the corruption case at the Shanghai Jianghai Customs was sentenced at the Capital District Court at 3:00 PM on the 31st. After Judge Ouyang Shu and others took the court, the corrupt officials Yin Lansun (Jianghai Customs Assistant) and others were brought up. Yin and others looked worried, knowing that there was more bad luck than good luck. Then, everyone stood in silence, and the judge read the main text of the judgment as follows:

"Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Baohui jointly extorted money, and Zhang Yuan was an accomplice. Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Yuan are each sentenced to death, Zhang Baohui is sentenced to life imprisonment, and all are deprived of civil rights for life. Also, for the continuous joint receipt of bribes for acts that violate their duties, Zhang Yuan was an accomplice. Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Yuan are each sentenced to death, Zhang Baohui is sentenced to life imprisonment, and all are deprived of civil rights for life. Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Yuan are each to be executed, Zhang Bao will be executed for life imprisonment, and all will be deprived of civil rights for life. Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, Zhang Baohui, and Zhang Yuan jointly received a bribe of 315 million yuan in legal tender from the Liquan Yong Dye Chemical Company, a bribe of 800 million yuan in legal tender from the Minfu Trading Co., Ltd., a bribe of 90 million yuan from the Tianhe and Dakang Dye Shops, and a bribe of 300 million yuan in legal tender from the Yifeng Company. All should be jointly responsible by Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, Zhang Baohui, and Zhang Zhou for submitting the case for confiscation. Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, Zhang Baohui, and Zhang Yuan jointly extorted 8,000 US dollars from Lu Genquan. Except for the 1,225 US dollars submitted by Zhang Zhou, which has been received by Lu Genquan, the remaining 6,775 US dollars, converted into 600 million and 975,000 yuan in legal tender, should be jointly responsible by Yin Lansun, Yue Xinmin, and Zhang Baohui for submitting the case to Lu Genquan for collection."

After reading, the judge told the Yin and other criminals that if they did not agree with the judgment, they could apply to the Supreme Court for a judgment through the District Court within ten days. If the defendant did not apply on his own, the court would apply on his behalf. Finally, the four criminals were ordered to press their fingerprints and withdraw from the court. The criminals were returned to custody. The full text of the judgment will be released when it is delivered to the criminals. When the verdicts were heard, except for Zhang Baohui, all the others turned pale. Yin Lansun frowned. The female relatives of the criminals who came to court to listen were almost in tears.

### Editorial: The Spirit of Gandhi Lives Forever!

Mr. Gandhi, the spiritual leader of India, aged seventy-eight, was assassinated on the afternoon of January 30th on his way to evening prayer, succumbing to three bullets! Gandhi's last words were "God! God!" Indian Prime Minister Nehru broadcast to the entire Indian people, declaring the 31st as a national day of mourning.

Mr. Gandhi, this great sage of our time, witnessing India's independence, could not bear the division of the Hindu and Muslim communities. To address the suspicion and mistrust caused by the Kashmir issue, leading to war and death, he embarked on a fast of one hundred and twenty-one hours and forty-five minutes, appealing for peace between the Hindu and Muslim communities. Thirteen days after humanity was restored and bestiality receded, this great sage of our time unfortunately died by assassination, bringing immeasurable disaster and loss to India, to humanity, and to history! Mr. Gandhi's death can be compared to that of Jesus Christ!

Who killed this great sage of our time? A violent extremist from the Hindu faith. Who destroyed the halo of peace? A force that extinguished conscience. The evening of January 30, 1948, was the darkest moment for India, for humanity, and for history; tragic, terrifying, and shameful, filled with this moment. We mourn Gandhi, we lament the sage; we hope that Mr. Gandhi's sacred blood will cleanse the hatred and shame of the world, and that the tears of millions of people will wash away the turmoil and death in India. When Mr. Gandhi was suddenly attacked, he covered his forehead with his hand, still showing a gesture of forgiving the assassin. Although he died at the hands of this thug, his spirit should be able to bring repentance to millions of thugs. Mr. Gandhi sacrificed his life for India's freedom and peace, and will smile contentedly in the afterlife, living forever in the world!

Mr. Gandhi was a great sage. His life, his ideals, and his faith are the highest moral standards for humanity in this century. He was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, the capital of Kathiawar in western India. His family was wealthy, but he lived a life of simplicity and tranquility, working hard and unremittingly to fight for India's independence and liberation, and to advocate for the peaceful existence of mankind. Although he was a Hindu, his religious thought was broad; he believed that he himself was an instrument of God. This thought of his is consistent with that of Buddha and Jesus. The only way to approach God in one's mind and promote peace in the world is to abstain from violence. For the sake of India's independence, he was willing to sacrifice everything, but he was unwilling to achieve his goal through violence. He opposed war and opposed aggression because he believed that humanity could not establish peace on the basis of force. Seeing that the desire for leadership had already threatened world peace, he himself was unwilling to be the leader of Indian politics, so he was an extreme opponent of Stalin. He was a sage rather than a hero. He was the spiritual master of the Indian people, the halo of world peace. He was not a "power," nor would he ever use power to achieve his own ends. His thoughts and actions were based on public opinion. He was a true democrat; if he saw that his own views were not supported by public opinion, he would immediately abandon them. In his history of struggle, he was imprisoned three times, fasted fifteen times, and was assassinated four times. Now, he died by assassination after his last fast. Throughout his life, he opposed death, but he himself was not afraid of death. He had foreseen that his physical strength would decline in his old age, and that his life was like a flickering candle. He hoped that he would not die from fasting, that his hope would not be extinguished, and that he would live a little longer to continue serving humanity.

Most of India's nine major religions revere Mr. Gandhi. He became a symbol of India's unity. Throughout his life, he was imprisoned and fasted, all for the sake of India's independence and freedom. He opposed the partition of India and Pakistan. When India achieved independence and implemented partition, Gandhi, with his wisdom and sincerity in pursuing truth, hoped that India and Pakistan would not be divided. After the Indian and Muslim communities decided to separate, Gandhi respected public opinion and abandoned his "preconceptions." In fact, he sacrificed truth for the sake of seeking peace. When the Kashmir issue arose and the war threatened to spread throughout the territory, with division and hatred echoing each other, this great sage of our time was boundlessly saddened. He finally began his last fast on January 13. He said, "I must be satisfied to see the hearts of the people of India reunited before I am willing to stop fasting. If I should die, then let me die. It is more glorious to die than to watch India be destroyed." After one hundred and twenty-one hours and forty-five minutes, his spirit of great benevolence, great courage, great impartiality, and great wisdom finally moved the leaders of the Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim religions in India on the 18th. They listened together to the weak, warm voice of this old man before Mr. Gandhi's "deathbed": "I fear that I will not be in this world for long. I hope that Pakistan can reunite with India." He hoped that Pakistan would abandon its dominion status and merge with India to form a single country again. He hoped that all ethnic groups in India would live in harmony, coexist, and liberate the poor and helpless people. He opposed the Nehru government's submission of the Kashmir issue to the United Nations Security Council. He stopped the revengeful thoughts of extremist youths from the Hindu faith. He prayed every night, calling on the people of India and Pakistan to unite in small groups. The Hindu extremists opposed him. The so-called "anti-Gandhi movement" demonstrations and the bomb at the evening prayer meeting on January 20 were these thugs' demonstrations against Mr. Gandhi. Mr. Gandhi opposed the use of violence and bloodshed throughout his life, but he himself was not afraid of violence and bloodshed, so the tragic day of January 30 finally occurred. The ferocity of the thugs, the bestiality of the thugs, brought chaos and disaster to India. They destroyed their "Bapu" (meaning "father"), that is, they destroyed the highest moral standards they should have revered. If the people of India and Pakistan do not realize this, do not transform selfishness with impartiality, and do not use Gandhi's great benevolence and great compassion to eliminate suspicion and mistrust, then there will inevitably be even more tragic wars between India and Pakistan in the future. In short, if humanity is extinguished and bestiality is revived, a scene of mad slaughter and the repayment of thousands of generations of hatred will submerge all of India! What kind of era is this?

We mourn Mr. Gandhi, the great sage of our time. We do not want Indian history to suffer this tragic fate. We hope that the riots in Bombay after Mr. Gandhi's assassination can be quelled immediately. We hope that the leaders and politicians of the Indian and Muslim communities will shed tears of repentance over Mr. Gandhi's bloody corpse, pray for peace and unity before the halo of this great sage, sincerely extend their bloody hands, put into practice the last words of this great sage, and cooperate again, without splitting. If the leaders and politicians of India and Pakistan have vision, conscience, can reflect, and can repent, then Mr. Gandhi's death will save India from death, and Mr. Gandhi's bloodshed will replace the bloodshed of millions of people in India and Pakistan. When that young assassin shot Mr. Gandhi, the old man's dying voice said to him: "You have come too late!" We believe that this reactionary violence, this thief of justice, was caught at this very moment. If, after this moment, the peace and unity of India can be quickly realized, then it is not too late and not too far away.

The spirit of Mr. Gandhi is the spirit of India, and it is also the spirit of mankind. His life symbolizes India's peace and symbolizes mankind's peace. His unparalleled great power and moral standards should forever be the spirit of India, the spirit of mankind, the symbol of India's peace, and the symbol of mankind's peace. The halo of this great sage of our time radiates boundless light from the pool of blood, illuminating the world and mankind. May all demons and all ethnic hatreds forever retreat and disappear before the soul of this peaceful old man.

We pray: The spirit of Mr. Gandhi is immortal, the spirit of Mr. Gandhi lives forever!

### UNRRA's Leftover Materials Fund: Decision to Transfer to the Custody Committee; Director Rooks' Replay Approves

[Reported by this newspaper] The Custody Committee of the Executive Yuan's Post-War Rehabilitation and Relief Administration held its second general meeting at the Bank of China Building yesterday morning.

In addition, it was also approved to transfer UNRRA's gift to the Custody Committee. Four million seven hundred thousand of the five million US dollars will be deposited in the Bank of China in New York, and three hundred thousand dollars will be in the Bank of China in London, for the purpose of purchasing materials needed for long-term projects in the United States or the United Kingdom and paying salaries to foreign staff of the committee.

Decision on the treatment of Chinese staff

The treatment of Chinese staff of the Custody Committee will be 30% higher than the salaries of civil servants. The treatment of staff of the Post-War Rehabilitation and Relief Administration will remain the same as that of civil servants. As for foreign staff, the committee will hire a total of 56 experts at home and abroad, with an estimated annual cost of 400,000 US dollars (including allowances and travel expenses to China). The Custody Committee's budget for February is set at over 260 billion yuan, including long-term planned projects, administrative and affiliated institutions' subsidies.

Regarding the UNRRA materials: (A) All materials that have been allocated to various post-war rehabilitation institutions but are still owned by UNRRA will be transferred to the Chinese government, but must be managed by the Custody Committee. (B) The remaining 150,000 bales of cotton (unsold, worth approximately 5 trillion yuan), as well as other small amounts of undelivered materials, will be cleared by the General Materials Depot. Those needed for long-term projects will be retained, and those not needed will be sold.

### Cleveland: Leaves Shanghai for the United States

Expresses farewell regrets in pre-departure remarks

[Reported by this newspaper] UNRRA's China Office Director Cleveland left Shanghai for the United States by Pan American Airlines yesterday morning. Mr. Cleveland succeeded General Egerton as the director of the China Office last May. Before leaving Shanghai, he expressed that he felt quite reluctant to leave and said, "Participating in UNRRA's work has been the most satisfying experience of my life. We feel that there are still some goals that have not been achieved, but I believe that the work that has been completed in the past is worth spending a lot of money and effort on." Mr. Cleveland also said: Most of the past achievements should be attributed to the Post-War Rehabilitation and Relief Administration, and he enjoyed working with Directors Huo Baoshu and Li Chemin very much. He also stated: The success of the Custody Committee's work has a great impact on the Chinese economy. It is hoped that the materials under its management can be put to good use, as the success of this work can serve as an effective guide for the establishment of other aid organizations in China. Mr. Cleveland also stated: His position as a member of the Custody Committee was originally to represent the American International Bank, but the bank will not send a representative to take up the position for the time being. He has asked Lu Gengnasan, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Far East Economic Commission, to attend the meetings as an observer. His positions on the Finance and Fisheries Committees will be taken over by Kilpatrick and Wu Deng, respectively. To express its gratitude for Mr. Cleveland's contributions, the Custody Committee has specially requested Mr. Cleveland to serve as the committee's liaison representative in the United States.

### Kowloon Walled City Residents Demand the Release of Two Arrested Representatives

Request Guo Dehua to Negotiate with the Hong Kong Government

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 31st] Representatives of the residents of the Kowloon Walled City visited Guo Dehua, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Guangdong and Guangxi, yesterday, requesting Guo to negotiate with the Hong Kong government and immediately release the arrested resident representatives Zhu Peitang and Liu Yifu. It is reported that on the 13th of this month, the Kowloon judicial authorities believed that Zhu Peitang and Liu Yifu attempted to prevent the Hong Kong government from sending people to demolish the wooden houses in the Kowloon Walled City on the 5th, and each was sentenced to three months of hard labor.

"If the Hong Kong government does not take action because the issue of sovereignty over the Kowloon Walled City is still under discussion, it would be a mistake." At the same time, the newspapers here believe that our newspapers' condemnation of Britain has never exceeded the scope of international morality. The British side does not blame the Hong Kong government for the Kowloon Walled City incident, but tries to blame Chinese newspapers. All newspapers expressed their protest and hoped that Britain would not hold prejudices again, so as not to further harm the friendship between the two countries.

### Shenyang Plane Crash Tragedy: Cause of Accident Ascertained; CNA Air's Ping-Shen Flight Inaugurated

[Reported by this newspaper] Personnel sent by China National Aviation Corporation to Pan Yang to investigate the crash of aircraft 4747 have returned to Shanghai. Regarding the investigation results, the representative sent by the Civil Aviation Administration has submitted a detailed report to the bureau. According to the technical personnel of CNA who returned to Shanghai, the cause of the accident may be as follows: Due to the current situation, most passengers competed to board the plane. After their luggage was weighed, they used relatives and friends seeing them off to secretly pass some luggage onto the plane after boarding. During takeoff, many passengers did not follow the regulations and gathered at the tail of the plane, causing the tail to be too heavy, which was not conducive to takeoff. According to pilot Wei Si's report, no mechanical obstacles were found during takeoff, and the engine did not catch fire (not as previously reported). However, he felt that the tail of the plane was very heavy and the runway was too short. Although he managed to take off, he was forced to land and eventually caused the accident. Secondly, the wires installed in the plane were suitable for flying in tropical and temperate zones. Special types of wires must be used for flying in cold areas. CNA had already purchased them, but because the import license was repeatedly not obtained, they are still stored in the warehouse and cannot be extracted for use. Furthermore, according to the personnel of the company who returned to Shanghai, the situation of passengers in Pan Yang was quite chaotic. They did not follow the order of seating, buying tickets, and weighing. One day, a general officer and four companions forcibly boarded the plane, stating that if they were not allowed to board, they would shoot the CNA staff. The CNA Pan Yang station could not stop them and was forced to unload the mail and let them board the plane. The company authorities have urgently telegraphed the Ministry of Communications to request the Xingyuan to send personnel to handle seat reservations and maintain order so that Pan Yang's external transportation can be maintained.

[Reported by this newspaper from Beiping on the 31st] Air transportation to Pingpan will be strengthened immediately.

### "Military and Civilian Cooperation to Eradicate the Communist Bandits" - Minister Bai Broadcasts to Retired Military Officers Nationwide

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 31st] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi broadcast to retired military officers nationwide from Hankou at 8:45 pm tonight, entitled "Military and Civilian Cooperation to Eradicate the Communist Bandits." The original text is as follows:

Fellow retired military officers across the country: This time, I, Chongxi, have been ordered to supervise the suppression of the Communist bandits in the Dabie Mountains, and have also been instructed to guide the self-defense organization training of the people in the five provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan during the bandit suppression period. I deeply feel the great responsibility and heavy burden. Due to being tied up with military affairs, I cannot go to various places to extend my condolences to all retired military officers in person. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to explain my expectations for all of you. Looking back at the Northern Expedition in the past,

Glorious History. Looking back at the Northern Expedition,

our National Revolutionary Army, with a troop strength of less than 100,000 and weapons of less than 50,000, mostly of poor quality, our entire officers and soldiers were deeply inspired by the Three Principles of the People, displayed the revolutionary spirit, and strived to practice pragmatism and complete the revolution. Under the leadership of the Supreme Commander, we fought bravely and advanced relentlessly, ultimately defeating more than a million counter-revolutionary forces of the warlords with fewer troops and more victories. This is truly a brilliant and splendid historical achievement in the revolutionary process. During the War of Resistance against Japan, we relied on our loyal and brave officers and soldiers to obey the orders of the Supreme Commander, support the national policy of resistance, and confront the enemy with inferior equipment with one heart and one mind, sacrificing and fighting for eight years. In the end, we were able to cooperate with the Allied forces, defeat the common enemy, win the final glorious victory, and abolish the unequal treaties of the past century, so that our international status could be improved. Such arduous and outstanding achievements from the Northern Expedition to the War of Resistance are certainly the supreme price obtained through the war with the heads and hot blood of countless martyrs, and also the immortal result of the past efforts and struggles of our surviving officers. Moreover, it is the greatest contribution to being loyal to the country, filial to the nation, and to the peace of the world. Here, we should express our sincere condolences to the deceased martyrs, and express our supreme respect to the loyal and brave officers who survived hundreds of battles.

Suppressing Bandits. Originally, after winning the victory of the eight-year arduous War of Resistance against Japan, the country could engage in restoration and construction, and the military and civilians could get a chance to recuperate and rest. However, the Communist bandits, relying on their illegal armed forces, disrupted everywhere, violated military and government orders, and destroyed peace and unity, causing our restoration and construction work to be greatly hindered. After eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, the compatriots in various places were freed from the oppression of the enemy and puppet regimes, but they were again subjected to the rape, abuse, and looting of the Communist bandits. Their crimes of harming the country and endangering the people were exposed without reservation, and they even openly launched a full-scale rebellion. Their ambition is to subvert the National Government and ruin the country and the nation. In order to maintain the unity of the country and save the compatriots in the bandit areas from the depths of misery, the central government had to take military action and implement the suppression of bandits. Since the government issued the General Mobilization Order in July last year, it has clearly expressed its determination to suppress the rebellion. Under this goal, we must prioritize the suppression of bandits militarily, mobilize all manpower, financial resources, and material resources, implement a wartime system, exert the power of general mobilization, and eliminate banditry. Because bandit suppression solely relying on military power to defeat the main force of the bandits still cannot completely eliminate them, political, military, economic, and cultural aspects must be closely coordinated, and the military and the people must be united, and a full-scale mobilization must be carried out to form a whole combat entity, so that the overall strength can be exerted, a comprehensive tactic can be used, and the control of a wide area can be achieved, so that the bandits have no place to stand or survive, and the bandit scourge can be eradicated.

Organizing and Training the People. In order to make politics closely cooperate with the military, it is natural to use military power to cover politics, and at the same time, use political power to strengthen the grassroots level to assist the military. At present, the only urgent task for bandit suppression is to universally mobilize the people and establish local self-defense armed forces to cooperate with the national army and jointly suppress the bandits. The central government recently promulgated the regulations for the organization and training of people's self-defense teams in various counties and cities, which is a measure specifically aimed at the needs of the current bandit suppression. It has clear and specific regulations on the organization and training of people's self-defense, the raising of funds for weapons and ammunition, and so on.

At present, the main problem we face in implementing people's organization and training and establishing local self-defense armed forces is training cadres. I believe that suppressing bandits is an inevitable obligation, and every citizen should be mobilized to protect their lives and property. At the same time, I also hope that all retired military officers will serve their hometowns and be loyal to the country.

Serving as Basic Cadres. Retired military officers possess the spirit and discipline of soldiers. In the past Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance against Japan, they have made meritorious contributions and experienced hundreds of battles. They are all loyal and brave men. During this period of bandit suppression, based on the friendship of loving their hometown and country, they should organize retired military officer associations in accordance with regulations to assist the local government and serve as basic cadres for the organization and training of the people. Those who participate in the work of the self-defense team, in addition to the local subsidies for staple and non-staple foods, will also be paid a monthly retirement allowance by the Ministry of National Defense from January of this year, which will be transferred by the provincial governments or district administrations at all levels to maintain their livelihoods and work with peace of mind. As for retired military officers who are not employed in the self-defense team, they will still be paid retirement allowances in two installments each year in accordance with the original regulations. I hope that retired military officers across the country will rise up, enthusiastically contribute their efforts, participate in the work of organizing and training the people under the leadership of the security commanders of each province, so that the local self-defense armed forces can be established quickly, cooperate with the national army, carry out suppression, and stabilize the local area. This is my hope for our loyal and patriotic retired military officers. I sincerely hope that all loyal and brave comrades will seize the opportunity to rise up and jointly complete the task of suppressing the rebellion.

### All Indian People Sobbing and Weeping, Flowers and Sandalwood Cremate Gandhi, Nehru Kneels and Kisses the Corpse Before the Funeral Pyre is Lit

Funeral Procession Five Miles Long, Ceremony Extremely Solemn and Respectful

[Reuters, New Delhi, 31st] Hundreds of thousands of Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, and people of no religious belief formed a procession five miles long to participate in Gandhi's funeral procession. Gandhi's body, wrapped in white homespun cloth with his face exposed, was carried from Birla House to a flower-covered military vehicle by his granddaughter, Ava, his secretary, and several followers. Governor-General Mountbatten, wearing a black armband and accompanied by his two daughters, Prime Minister Nehru, Deputy Prime Minister Patel, Defense Minister Singh, and other prominent figures, all attended in person. The wreaths sent by all walks of life, including those sent by the diplomatic corps of various countries, numbered in the hundreds. As the hearse left Birla House, bugles sounded, and amid sobs and weeping, the slogan of Gandhi's victory was shouted. Along the way, people climbed onto walls and fences, some climbed onto branches, and the rest stood on both sides of the road. The hearse was pulled by personnel from the army, navy, and air force. Nehru, Patel, and Singh rode in the same car, walking alongside the party's army. As the hearse passed through the main street of Delhi, the Royal Avenue, near the Memorial Gate, many people climbed onto the statue erected in memory of King George V to get a glimpse of Gandhi's last remains. Leading the procession was a large team of Gurkha troops, followed by paratroopers, cavalry, and several military trucks, then Boy Scout troops and a women's team all dressed in white. Gandhi's body was washed with water from the Mibena River when it was placed in Birla House last night. The body was covered with flowers, and only one oil lamp was lit in the room. At the same time, carpenters and artisans worked overnight on the banks of the Mibena River to rush to build a brick enclosure, constructing the cremation site for Gandhi's remains. Today, as the hearse approached the cremation site, the area was cordoned off by air force soldiers standing shoulder to shoulder, and the crematorium, built by bricklayers and tilers, was nearly completed. Firewood was piled high on the platform. At this time, some in the crowd went from sobbing to wailing. Nehru shouted loudly for order. A woman holding a child tried to rush towards the cremation platform, but was stopped by Mrs. Mountbatten. Gandhi's body was placed into the cremation enclosure at 4:30 pm, and planes scattered flowers onto the body from the sky. Nehru stepped forward to the body and knelt to kiss Gandhi's feet. Gandhi's son, Tvedas, stood at the head end. Before long, the wood ignited, and flames spurted out from all four corners, with thick smoke obscuring the sight of the audience. After the cremation ceremony was completed, relatives, officials, tanks, and armored vehicles also returned to Delhi in succession.

[United Press, New Delhi, 31st] Gandhi's body was cremated at 5:00 pm this afternoon. His son, Tvedas, lit the fire. The body was wrapped in flowers and placed on sandalwood for cremation, which is an Indian tradition.

[United Press, New Delhi, 31st] When Gandhi was cremated, the smoke rose straight into the sky. The ashes remained on the banks of the Jumna River for a day and a half, and then were collected and carried to the sacred Ganges River to be scattered in the water, which is an Indian traditional custom.

### The Murderer Goche is Detained

[Reuters, New Delhi, 31st] Goche, the murderer who executed Gandhi, is still in police custody. Police revealed that in the initial interrogation, Goche admitted that what he did was not wrong, because he believed that Gandhi's remarks and policies were contrary to the interests of Hindus. He said that he had heart disease, but he was very happy with what he did.

[Reuters, Pona, 31st] Police today carried out a thorough search of the residence of Goche, the murderer who assassinated Gandhi, and several houses belonging to the Indian Mahasaba (a Hindu political organization). Goche is the editor of a local "Indian World" magazine. The magazine's address is also heavily guarded by police officers.

### Gandhi's Assassination Process: Repeatedly Called Out "God! God!" Before His Death

[United Press, New Delhi, 30th] Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu extremist on the night of the 30th, and the assassin's brutality has plunged India into sorrow and terror. Gandhi died at 12:15 am Greenwich Mean Time (8:15 am Shanghai time), with his head resting on his sixteen-year-old granddaughter, Manni Teng. He died just half an hour after the assassin, Nadu Rem, a Hindu extremist, shot him in the body with a small-caliber pistol. Gandhi was assassinated in the garden of Pala Villa, appearing before his thousand followers to lead them to a summer pagoda for his usual evening prayer meeting. Gandhi, wearing his usual linen clothes and holding a sturdy wooden staff, was a few feet away from the pagoda when the bullets were fired at him from the pagoda. He immediately fell to the ground after being shot, with his hand covering his forehead. This is the Hindu gesture of forgiving his murderer. Because the distance was not far, all three bullets hit him, one in his thigh, one in his abdomen, and one in his chest. He did not say a word before he died. Before he was shot, some people at the scene believed that he had said to the assassin, "You are too late." The assassin had been standing by the garden path, with his hands clasped in front of him, making the Hindu gesture of welcome, but in his palm was hidden a pistol, which he used to shoot Gandhi from a few feet away. The assassin fired a fourth shot, attempting suicide, but the bullet only grazed his scalp. The shooting of the pistol was like setting off a string of firecrackers. A moment later, Gandhi's followers realized what had happened. Then, they fiercely attacked the assassin, but the non-police intervened with rifle bayonets, otherwise the assassin would have been beaten into mincemeat by the followers. Gandhi was immediately carried to Pala Villa, with his head resting on his granddaughter's lap. Within a few minutes, his granddaughter said to the terrified crowd, including Indian Prime Minister Nehru: "Grandfather is dead!" Then Manni got up and sat cross-legged beside the body of the old man who sacrificed for peace and humanity, reciting Hindu scriptures that have been around for two thousand years.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 30th] Gandhi died twenty minutes after being assassinated. His last words were: "God! God!"

### Gandhi's Sense of Humor: Jokes Become Prophecy

[United Press, New Delhi, 31st] Gandhi was also quite humorous. Former United Press wartime spinner and current Evening News Manager Grover recalled an incident today. Gandhi was arrested several times for fighting for Indian freedom. Once, just after being released from prison, United Press Indian Branch President Preston Grover, his old friend, visited him first. Gandhi smiled at him and said, "Are you here? One day I enter the gates of heaven, I am sure the first person I will meet must be a United Press reporter."

[Reuters, London, 30th] People worldwide have expressed sorrow and shock at the passing of one of the world's greatest figures. From King George VI and US President Truman to leaders of other nations, telegrams of condolence have poured in. At Lake Success, where discussions on Kashmir between India and Pakistan are ongoing, Pakistani representative Sir Zafrulla Khan was the first to offer condolences to Indian representative Ayengar. Truman's telegram stated that Gandhi's life and work were his greatest monument. The playwright George Bernard Shaw remarked, "It shows how dangerous it is to be too good." Churchill expressed shock and sorrow at this senseless act of violence. Reactions from various locations are recorded as follows:

England: The King telegraphed Lord Mountbatten, Governor-General of India, asking him to convey to the Indian people that he and the Queen were deeply shocked and expressed their sincerest sympathy for this irreparable loss to the Indian people. Prime Minister Attlee, upon receiving the news at lunchtime, immediately telegraphed Prime Minister Nehru, expressing the deepest condolences on behalf of the United Kingdom government and saying that the world felt grief at the death of this greatest servant of mankind. The newly appointed US Ambassador to India, Grady, who is currently in London en route to Delhi, expressed hope that Gandhi's tragic death would enable the people of India and Pakistan to adhere to the principles Gandhi espoused throughout his life. Upon hearing the news, the Indian High Commissioner in London immediately ordered the embassy to fly its flag at half-mast. He sat alone in the library for over an hour, then summoned more than a hundred embassy staff to report this terrible news, expressing that such crimes inflicted on this great man show that the world is in darkness. Both the upper and lower houses of Parliament immediately passed resolutions, sending telegrams of condolence to the Indian government. Foreign Secretary Bevin stated that no greater man than Gandhi had ever existed in Indian history. He fought for peace throughout his life, opposing the use of violence. People of all classes in every country in the world would feel a loss due to Gandhi's death. The Indian community in London and Indian students in the UK have designated the 21st as a day of fasting to express mourning. High Commissioner Menon will hold a memorial service at the High Commission, which diplomats from various countries will attend. London will also fly its flag at half-mast tomorrow.

United States: President Truman issued a statement from the White House, praising Gandhi as an international great man, whose life's achievements would be his everlasting and great monument. The statement read: "Gandhi was the great leader of the Indian nation, and also an international great man, whose doctrines and actions have made the most profound impression on millions of people. He is someone the Indian people will never forget. His words and deeds not only influenced government affairs, but also shaped the spirit of the Indian people. It is unfortunate that he did not live to see the full realization of his principles, but his life's achievements will be his greatest monument. His selfless struggle is a model for Indian leaders. It is believed that people of all colors, not only the Indian people, will be moved by his sacrifice and strive for the peace that Gandhi advocated." Secretary of State Marshall telegraphed Prime Minister Nehru, expressing the shock and mourning of the entire United States, and pointed out that this proved the close ties between the Indian and American nations. In the House of Representatives, Congressman Keating moved that the House observe a moment of silence to express mourning. The New York Times issued a special edition, and the New York Herald Tribune likened Gandhi's death to Lincoln's death.

France: The acting President of the National Assembly, Lejeune, announced Gandhi's death, and all members of the Assembly rose and stood in silence for two minutes. Lejeune said: "A great thinker who taught people to love and not to hate has passed away." The National Assembly then unanimously passed a resolution proposed by Prime Minister Schuman, by which the National Assembly would send a telegram of condolence to the Indian government.

Lake Success: The United Nations Headquarters ordered all member states to fly their flags at half-mast to express mourning.

### US to Sign Treaty of Friendship, Commerce with Italy

US Rejects Two Soviet Protests

[Our Dispatch] New York, 31st (Broadcast): Rome Dispatch: Italy and the United States will sign a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation on Monday. This will be the first treaty signed by the United States with a European country since the war, and the first treaty signed by Italy and the United States since the Fascist regime came to power. The Soviet Union has expressed opposition to the presence of US warships in Italian territorial waters. The Italian government has informed the Soviet Union that Italy is an independent country and that no other country has the right to interfere. The news of the signing of the treaty came at this time. The treaty will be permanent and will not have a time limit.

[Reuters, Washington, 30th] Official news: The US government will formally reject within 24 hours the Soviet Union's protests regarding the US use of airfields in North Africa and US warships using Italian ports.

### Soviet Refusal to Cooperate Makes the Work of the UN Commission Difficult

[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 30th] A spokesman for the United Nations Commission on Korea announced today that the chairman of the commission, Menon, and Secretary-General Hoo Shih-tse, are expected to depart for Lake Success around February 15 to report to the Interim Committee of the General Assembly on the Soviet Union's refusal to allow the commission to carry out its work in North Korea. The spokesman also said that the United Nations resolution establishing the Commission on Korea stipulated that free elections should be held throughout Korea. Given the Soviet Union's actions, the Commission believes that it has no authority to decide whether to hold these elections only in South Korea without amending the United Nations resolution. The weekly mail train from Pyongyang brought a reply from Colonel-General Terentii Shtykov, commander of the Soviet occupation zone, to Menon. Menon's letter requested the Soviet authorities to assist the work of the commission. The fact that the reply has not been made public is sufficient to confirm the news of the Soviet Union's refusal to cooperate. The Commission was originally scheduled to hold a plenary meeting on the 31st to discuss the wording of its report to the United Nations, but this has been postponed until next week because the French representative, Pengu, is currently absent.

### Chairman of the Far Eastern Commission Reaffirms US Policy Toward Japan

[US Information Service, Washington, 30th] General McCoy, the US representative and Chairman of the Far Eastern Commission, issued the following statement in response to recent newspaper reports aimed at revealing the state of discussions within the Commission, which are inevitably inaccurate or even completely distorted: "I, as Chairman, wish to clarify that no member state of the Far Eastern Commission has attempted to 'obstruct consideration' of the issue of increasing the number of member states of the Commission, or any other suggestion.

Regarding the demilitarization of Japan, as clarified in the Secretary-General's report to the press last July, the Commission has been actively discussing this topic for months in order to establish principles based on the relevant sections of the Commission's basic policy agreement. During these discussions, representatives of various countries have made suggestions from time to time, which naturally reflect different viewpoints. Regarding this issue, as with other issues, negotiations have been ongoing in the Commission in order to reach an agreement among the Allied nations. I, as the US representative, presented a statement to the Commission last week regarding the Japanese economy, which has since been made public. The US government recognizes that the cooperation of the Far Eastern Commission and its member states is necessary for the successful completion of the plan to create a self-sufficient economy in Japan. US policy toward Japan, whether political or economic, is aimed at creating conditions for maintaining peace. Allied cooperation through the Far Eastern Commission is an important part of this policy."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 30th] Major General McCoy, the US representative to the Far Eastern Commission, today categorically denied that he himself or any other representative of the Commission had "obstructed consideration" of the various proposals recently submitted to the Commission by the Soviet Union. McCoy's statement was in response to the news that the newly arrived Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Panyushkin, has launched a "strong campaign" to limit MacArthur's implementation of occupation policies in Japan and to demand the continued demilitarization of Japan. In his official statement, McCoy reaffirmed US support for the Far Eastern Commission as a "key part" of Allied cooperation, and said that recent press reports about the discussions within the Far Eastern Commission contained inaccurate and confusing insinuations. However, he made an exception for a report claiming that McCoy had "obstructed" the voting on a proposal submitted by Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin, which argued that MacArthur should be ordered to dismantle all of Japan's military facilities within six months and to destroy within three months all personnel files of Japanese military personnel. McCoy acknowledged that there were differences of opinion among the representatives of the Commission regarding the demilitarization of Japan, but he pointed out that although the views were different, there was still an atmosphere of full friendship. Personal relations between the representatives remained extremely harmonious. McCoy went on to discuss the rumors that the Soviet Union opposed the inclusion of Pakistan as a member of the Commission, saying that no representative in the Commission had obstructed the consideration of this proposal. Reporters learned that the above news originated from the weekly meeting of the Far Eastern Commission held yesterday. At that time, the Soviet representative presented a proposal regarding the demilitarization of Japan, requesting that the meeting discuss it. According to well-informed sources, the proposal aroused the usual debate, which involved differences of opinion between the United States and the Soviet Union, but there was no conflict between the US and Soviet representatives. As a result, no decision was made or vote taken on the issue.

### Hull's Memoirs—Copyright by North American Newspaper Alliance

— Translated by this Newspaper's Translation Department

When I stepped over the threshold of the State Department, the fact that the Latin American republics were already entering a state of flux further intensified the deteriorating situation in the Western Hemisphere. One of the most intense wars in the history of the New World (referring to North and South America), the Chaco War, was raging in the wilderness mountains and forests between Paraguay and Bolivia. Colombia and Peru had already experienced border conflicts, with the potential to escalate into a real war. In Cuba, the dictatorial government of General Gerardo Machado, after enduring twelve years, was beginning to crumble; revolution was brewing.

Before me was the Pan-American Conference scheduled to be held in Montevideo at the end of the year. This conference should have been held in December 1932, but at that time, because the hope for effective cooperation in the Western Hemisphere was so dim, it was decided to postpone it for a year. Now, there were repeated talks of postponing it again.

The whole outlook was extremely bleak, seemingly disheartening. Therefore, I understood that if the Good Neighbor Policy advocated by President Roosevelt were to be implemented, it would not be easy, especially in the Western Hemisphere. But this fact was also a challenge, enough to stir our courage.

Long before March 4th, I had decided that one of the principles we should adhere to in dealing with Latin America should be strict adherence to the principle of non-interference, like adhering to religious beliefs.

The situation in Cuba did indeed give us reason to worry. The hatred of the people towards General Machado's brutal dictatorship was growing. It was already very obvious that unless Machado resigned, the revolution would force him out. Bombings and shootings occurred endlessly in Havana, sugar factories and sugarcane fields were burned down, schools were closed, and the guerrillas left over from the unsuccessful revolution in 1931 were operating in the mountains. Political prisoners were pouring into the United States. In addition to political unrest, there was also economic hardship, partly due to the high tariff policy of the United States. The whole situation was extremely precarious.

According to the so-called Platt Amendment of the 1903 treaty, the United States had the right to intervene in Cuba to ensure Cuba's independence or to maintain a government strong enough to guarantee life, property, and individual liberty. But the President and I decided that we would never interfere in Cuba's internal affairs. Although we had the legal right, such action would only worsen the relationship between the entire Latin America and our country. It would overturn all our previous declarations of non-interference and would create an excuse for our traditional enemies, and my hope was to ensure that these enemies could find no excuse.

President Roosevelt and I agreed to send Welles to Cuba as an ambassador, and if the Cuban parties expressed willingness, he could try to mediate in the capacity of a presidential mediator. Based on the President's suggestion and my approval, Welles was appointed as Assistant Secretary of State on April 6, 1933. He had good abilities and experience, and was quite ambitious. In later years, our judgments differed greatly. In the early years, on important policy issues, I also felt that I agreed with my other colleagues more often than with Welles. Of course, I should bear the responsibility for all decisions, and in every situation, I always tried my best.

In May 1933, Welles set off for Cuba, carrying with him the instructions I issued on May 1, which stated: "You should always remember that the relationship between the U.S. government and the Cuban government is a relationship between autonomous, independent, and equal states, and no steps should be taken that would make it seem necessary for the U.S. government to exercise the formal right of interference, which is granted to the United States by the current treaty between the two countries." I instructed him to give all assistance to Cuba within his ability to improve the economic situation, negotiate trade agreements with Cuba, provide friendly mediation, and sincerely express to President Machado that we hoped he would take steps to end the state of terror.

On August 12, General Machado asked for leave of absence, and the next day, former Secretary of State Dr. Carlos de Caspedes formed a coalition government. After Machado's departure, the chaos expanded, and incidents of attacks on life and property occurred everywhere. President Roosevelt sent two cruisers to Cuban territorial waters, but stated that this action did not imply any intention of interfering or intervening in Cuba's internal affairs.

We decided that there was no need to give President Caspedes formal recognition, because the change of government was achieved through constitutional procedures. Welles was working hard and maintaining contact with various parties. On August 12, the State Department sent a telegram to Welles in the name of the President and myself, expressing our warm congratulations and "expressing appreciation for your work."

I often talked with the ambassadors of important Latin American countries about the Cuban issue. This was in line with the principle I had decided on, that is, whenever we needed to take diplomatic action toward Latin America, no matter what its nature, we must first consult with our relevant southern countries. We did not want to take unilateral action.

The situation was rapidly moving towards a climax, the disturbance in the Cuban army expanded, and the rebellion became increasingly urgent. The army mutinied under the leadership of Batista, and the Caspedes government finally collapsed. It was at that time (September 7) that I received a very long telegram from Ambassador Welles, suggesting that a considerable number of American troops be landed in Havana, and that a smaller number of troops be landed in other cities in Cuba.

He said in the telegram: "The method I propose will be a very limited intervention, of the following nature: the Caspedes government should be allowed to freely exercise its functions, just as it had before it was overthrown, with the full ability to control every department of the government. Of course, in the case where the majority of the army has mutinied, it is impossible for it to maintain its power in any satisfactory form. This point is very clear. If the situation is to change, unless the U.S. government is willing to assist it in maintaining public order, until the Cuban government has sufficient time... to organize a new army, if the "Caspedes government" so requests. To implement such a policy, it is necessary to land a considerable number of troops in Havana and a smaller number of troops in several more important ports in the Republic."

Ambassador Welles also said: "In my opinion, the shortcoming of this policy lies entirely in the fact that we will incur the very hostile opposition of the extremists and communists in Cuba... but in my opinion, I also feel that the detailed situation here has been fully explained to the representatives of various Latin American countries, and the landing of troops in Cuba is very obviously within the scope of the "Good Neighbor" policy. This policy has been expressed as much as possible in our relations with the Cuban people in the past five months."

After carefully reading and digesting this telegram, I personally took it to the White House to see the President and asked him to read it. After that, I firmly expressed my opinion to him, explaining that we could not and should not think of intervening in the Cuban situation, even to a limited extent. In my opinion, Welles was too influenced by the local situation and failed to consider the serious repercussions that would be caused throughout Latin America if we acceded to his request. Based on my previous conversations with the President, I knew that his determination not to intervene in the Cuban situation was as firm as mine. Mr. Roosevelt quickly agreed with my point of view. He said that he would only send a cruiser to Cuban territorial waters, where we already had several small squadrons stationed. Unless it was to evacuate American citizens caught in the conflict between Cuban political parties, naval vessels were strictly forbidden to send troops ashore.

After my meeting with the President, I returned to the hotel to draft a reply to Welles, which was already close to evening. Once the draft was completed, I went to the White House again. The President and I quickly agreed on the draft telegram. So I went to the State Department, and at eight o'clock in the evening, we sent the reply we had agreed on, which read as follows:

"We fully appreciate the points you have listed in the telegram. However, after careful consideration, the President has decided to send you the following telegram: "We are keenly aware that any promise, whether implicit or explicit, that involves the United States taking action in any situation, would be considered as undermining neutrality, favoring one party among many, and attempting to establish a government that, in the eyes of the world, especially Latin America, is a product of the U.S. government." The President's conversations with the representatives of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico have gained widespread approval in the United States and throughout Latin America. Any action that is contrary to the established policy will result in serious consequences.

"The above, of course, does not mean that you should prevent, let alone influence the dynamics of any faction; in other words, strict neutrality is essential." After the collapse of the Caspedes government, Dr. Grau San Martin became president. We temporarily delayed recognizing his government, to see if it could establish order. The war between the parties continued. It was in this situation that I took a boat to attend the Montevideo Conference, and two weeks after I set off, the President issued a statement indicating that our government was willing to reconsider the 1903 treaty, which gave us the legal right to military intervention in the Cuban situation. Therefore, at the opening of the Montevideo Conference, our attitude of non-interference was made clear to the world.

Throughout this year, Cuba was at the core of our country's new active policy toward Latin America. Our actions toward Cuba could prove to other Latin American countries whether our declarations of non-interference were sincere. On my way back to Washington (from Montevideo), the Martin government in Cuba had disappeared, and Colonel Carlos Mendieta, the leader of the Nationalist Party, had become president. The conversation I had with Ambassador Caffery in Key West was to discuss the issue of recognizing Mendieta.

After the conversation was over, I called Washington to explain to the President that I supported Ambassador Caffery's view that Mendieta should be recognized. On the same day, I received a telegram from the Acting Secretary of State, Philip, which stated that the President would invite the representatives of the Latin American countries in Washington to meet with him at the White House next Tuesday or Wednesday. The President will tell them that the preconditions we had stipulated for recognizing the Cuban government had been met, because Mendieta had obtained the political support of the people, and with the help of the Cuban armed forces, the government clearly had the ability to maintain public order.

Now, the State Department is busy preparing a new treaty to replace the 1903 treaty. Negotiations began on May 29, 1934, and I, along with Assistant Secretary of State Welles and Cuban Ambassador Sterling, signed the new treaty. Welles earnestly requested me to allow him the privilege of signing it with me, although this approach was not customary. But since he had participated in a large part of the negotiations, I agreed.

President Roosevelt submitted the treaty to the Senate on the same day. In a short span of two days, the Senate voted in favor. The instruments of ratification were exchanged on December 9, and the Cuban people declared a three-day holiday to celebrate this event.

### Dance Industry's Opposition to Dance Ban Triggers Major Riot; Wrecks Social Affairs Bureau and Injures Officials and Police; Over Four Hundred Dancers and Employees Detained for Interrogation Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] Over two thousand dancers and employees from 28 dance halls in this city, yesterday, in opposition to the lottery-based ban on dance venues, collectively stormed the Social Affairs Bureau, largely wrecking each office. Doors, windows, tables and chairs were almost entirely destroyed, and even a large number of important files and documents were ransacked, scattered all over the floor. At the time, the Labor-Management Arbitration Council was holding a meeting on the second floor, with Chairman Pan also present, nearly facing encirclement. As there were too few police officers on the scene at the time, they were unable to stop the riot, with many being injured. After 42 minutes of chaos, a large number of police officers finally arrived to suppress and stop the riot. The severity of the destruction was akin to a post-war battlefield. During and after the disturbance, as many as 43 officials and police officers were injured, and traffic on Xiafei Road and Songshan Road was also cut off for six to seven hours. The Social Affairs Bureau's lottery for banning dances, originally scheduled for 3:00 PM yesterday, was moved forward to 11:00 AM due to a conflict with the Labor-Management Arbitration Council meeting. When the dancers and employees learned of this news at a meeting at New Celestial Forest in the afternoon, their emotions were stirred. In a state of extreme emotional impulse, they rushed straight to the Social Affairs Bureau, enacting this unfortunate event. Afterwards, a large number of police officers arrived to surround and search for the rioting dancers and employees, detaining over four hundred people. The situation was chaotic, with many dancers injured from being squeezed and trampled. It was not until the entire search was completed that it was already 11:00 PM. Last night, all dance halls in the city were closed due to this incident, a rare occurrence since the establishment of dance halls in Shanghai.

After receiving the report, Mayor Wu was extremely angered and immediately convened Commander Xuan to report the incident to the central authorities, stating that the perpetrators would be severely punished according to the law. Police Chief Yu also made a similar statement; Commander Xuan has ordered a thorough investigation into those responsible for the wrecking of the Social Affairs Bureau and has ordered the arrest of the executive directors of the Dance Hall Business Association. The more than four hundred people who have been detained will begin to be interrogated today.

### New Celestial Forest Assembly: Bad News Spreads, Emotions Tense

At 2:00 PM, several thousand managers, employees, and dancers from 28 dance halls in the city convened a third temporary meeting at New Celestial Forest. The New Celestial Forest was packed with people, banners were raised high, and various anti-dance ban slogans were pasted on the walls. As the meeting began, news came that the Social Affairs Bureau had already moved the lottery forward to the morning, eliminating fourteen dance halls, including the first-class venues such as Celestial Music, Paramount, MGM, and Lido. At this time, the atmosphere at the meeting became tense, with dancers and employees relaying the news to each other, their expressions extremely agitated. Sun Hongyuan, the chairman of the Dance Industry Association, then reported this matter at the microphone, arguing that the Social Affairs Bureau's early lottery without prior notice was unreasonable, and stating that the constitution stipulates that people have the right to freely choose their profession. The government's claims that dance halls hinder thrift and harm social morals are not justified, therefore, the dance industry colleagues are determined to argue on the basis of reason and demand that the government withdraw its order. As Sun Hongyuan finished speaking, someone in the crowd of employees shouted "Oppose the lottery!" The entire venue responded, and a chorus of "Oppose the lottery" resounded for about a minute before subsiding.

### Shouting Willingness to Shed Blood

Speakers who followed included dance representative Sun Zhimin, executive director of the workers' union Hu Yunyuan, workers' representative Wang Liansheng, and dancers Chen Xueli, Jin Meihong, and several others. Their words were very激烈的激烈的, and the emotions of the crowd became even more high-strung, with shouts rising and falling in the venue. Sun Zhimin said: Today is a matter of life and death. The Social Affairs Bureau's early lottery is too excessive. Everyone must unite and reason with the Social Affairs Bureau. If there is a lottery, we want to see it drawn, otherwise there will be fraud. Why are commercial dance halls banned while party dances are not? We must unite and oppose this, and share life and death together. Hu Yunyuan, director of the Workers' Union, had an even more intense attitude, and his words attacked Director Wu Kaixian. At that time, some workers in the crowd shouted "Oppose Wu Kaixian! Oppose Director Wu!" and "Go to the Social Affairs Bureau, willing to shed blood," etc. After the Master of Ceremonies repeatedly shouted "Calm down! Calm down" into the microphone, it temporarily subsided. Afterwards, dancer Chen Xueli automatically took the stage to speak, with tears in her eyes, she said: "My family of eight, how will we live in the future! This is the government forcing us to sell our souls, forcing us to become prostitutes." Jin Meihong also said: "The government is forcing us onto the path of death, we are unwilling to be prostitutes." A chorus of shouts then arose among the dancers.

In the midst of the meeting's emotionally charged atmosphere, Zheng Weixian, director of MGM, was relatively calm. Zheng told the crowd at the microphone: This matter has been entrusted to a lawyer to file an administrative appeal with Nanjing, and we will strive for it according to the law. I hope everyone can be more rational. However, the emotions of the crowd were obviously not calmed by this.

### Dividing into Small Groups to Go Straight to the Social Affairs Bureau

After this, Wu Jichun, a representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stood up to speak, expressing his sympathy, and said that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce did not send anyone to participate in this morning's lottery. Lu Huimin and Zhang Hongwei, two members of women's groups, were also present, but did not speak. At this time, it was nearly 3:00 PM, and the crowd was already impatient. From the crowd, a shout of "Go to the Social Affairs Bureau" and "Time is money" rose up, echoing throughout the venue. Just as they were about to disperse after shouting slogans, Shui Xiangyun, chairman of the General Labor Union, arrived. Mr. Shui first expressed his sympathy, then said: He had spoken with Director Wu in the morning, and Director Wu had no choice but to do so under the orders of the central authorities, and had his own difficulties. Regarding the livelihood issues of women and workers, the Social Affairs Bureau has decided to open dance retraining courses for dancers, and give severance pay to workers, the funds for which will be raised by adding relief funds to the dance hall tea fees. Finally, he advised the crowd not to act emotionally, but to remain rational and strive for it within the bounds of the law, and that the labor union would definitely support them. Unexpectedly, as Mr. Shui finished speaking, someone in the crowd of workers shouted "Please Mr. Shui Xiangyun to lead us to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition," although Mr. Shui later broke free, the crowd of dancers and employees surged out of the New Celestial Forest gate, dividing into small groups, either on foot or by truck, successively gathering in the Social Affairs Bureau plaza.

### Beginning to Use Force: The Flying Fortress is Difficult to Block the Tide of People, Fourteen Police Officers are the First to Be Beaten

The first group arrived at 3:30 PM, followed by successive arrivals, until around 4:00 PM, when over two thousand dancers, employees, and musicians from the 28 dance halls had arrived, standing in rows facing north. Sun Hongyuan, chairman of the Dance Hall Business Association, and Zhu Yongming, secretary-general, were also present. The Social Affairs Bureau plaza was filled with banners and a sea of people.

At the time, the sixteenth meeting of the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee was being held in the bureau chief's conference room on the second floor, discussing important cases such as year-end bonuses for professional workers. Municipal Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Municipal Chamber of Commerce Chairman Xu Jiguang, Health Bureau Chief Zhang Wei, Executive Director of the Industrial Association Hu Boxiang, Secretary-General of the General Labor Union Liang Yongzhang, and others all personally attended. Chief Wu Kaixian, who also served as a committee member, attended the entire meeting. Yuan Wenzhang, director of the Fourth Division of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Chen Su, chief of the Tenth Section, were waiting in their offices for representatives of the dancers and employees to come and state their case. At this time, the crowd gathered in the plaza was noisy. At 4:05 PM, a shout of "We want to eat" was first issued from the crowd, rising and responding, gradually expanding. Then the crowd moved forward, gradually approaching the steps. The fourteen police officers of the Police Bureau Flying Fortress who were maintaining order on the scene tried their best to dissuade them, but the crowd swarmed forward. Some dancers and employees used the bamboo poles of their flags to violently strike the police officers' faces from all directions. A small number of police officers were unable to stop the crowd of people coming like a tide, and were pushed up the steps in one go, going straight up to the second floor via the left and right escalators, breaking into the deputy director's office, the conference room, and the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee office on the third floor, wrecking all the glass doors and windows, lights, telephones, documents, tables, chairs, and miscellaneous items in the room. They also threw broken chair legs, wooden boards, and documents out of the windows into the plaza, throwing the telephone wires and documents randomly on the ground, ignoring everyone's persuasion. Their scolding and exclamations were ferocious and unparalleled.

### The Swallows Screamed in Anger, Ferocious Beyond Compare

At this time, the dancers changed their usual gentle and approachable demeanor, rolled up their sleeves, shouted and yelled, revealing their ferocity. Instantly, paper scraps and glass shards flew everywhere, and the bureau chief's office was destroyed in an instant. Even the sofa covers were torn, and nothing, big or small, was intact, only the oil painting and bust statue of Chairman Chiang, placed on the east and west sides, still stood motionless. The wall clock in the bureau chief's residence was also smashed, with the hour hand pointing at 4:34.

### Chairman Pan and Others Nearly Involved

At this time, Chairman Pan was in the secretary's office of the Social Affairs Bureau, intending to inform Commander Xuan of the situation by telephone. A dancer saw this, rushed forward, and pressed down on the telephone to stop him. Another dancer, while crying and making a fuss, took the inkstone on the table, smashed the glass on the desk, and threw a teacup at the desk lamp. Chairman Pan, who was standing by, narrowly escaped being hit. Deputy Chairman Xu's face was splashed with water due to the breaking of a water jug.

At the same time, the plaza was also in chaos, with a group of employees rushing into the offices of the first division of the Social Affairs Bureau from another staircase, using bamboo poles to break the glass of each window and the lights, and wrecking various items. Office chairs and tables were thrown into the plaza, and then dismantled one by one by others. The Fourth Section of the First Division was the Grain Section. When the crowd rushed in, Section Chief Ji Mingzhai shouted, "This is the place where your food is handled," but the crowd replied, "Everyone has no food to eat, we don't care, hit them!" Niu Zezi, from the number two truck company, squeezed out of the crowd to call the general office from the third division chief's office. He was chased and beaten by the crowd, but was saved by a member of the Land Administration Bureau and locked in a garage, thus escaping safely. Lu, the squad leader of the Third Squadron of the Motor Vehicle Brigade, and several team members were also injured by bamboo poles and wooden blocks in the chaos. They were rushed to the hospital for treatment. The plaza was full of broken tables, broken chairs, torn paper, documents, bamboo poles, slogans, broken glass, and other items. Some of the cars parked in the plaza were also affected, with the window glass broken by bamboo poles and large sticks.

### Mass Brawl Unfolds in the Plaza; Dozens Injured on Both Sides

Police Branch Chief Injured; Three Pistols Snatched

When the mob began to vandalize, the Songshan Police Branch had already received the news and dispatched more than twenty police officers to assist in maintaining order. Unexpectedly, the mob changed its target and, wielding wooden sticks, rushed towards them. The police officers defended themselves with their bare hands, but eventually retreated. At that moment, the second batch of reinforcement police officers from the Songshan Branch arrived and re-entered the scene together. However, due to the chaotic order, the police officers were forced to enter and exit three times, still unable to quell the situation. At this time, Song Tingjun, the chief of the Songshan Police Branch, along with Section Chief Rong Yongshao, happened to enter from the main entrance on Linsen Road to investigate. They encountered a group of the mob, and in the midst of flying sticks, both suffered severe head and facial injuries. Seeing that the situation was beyond control, the Flying Fortress squad reported to the headquarters via radio. Director Yu urgently dispatched all criminal police and the remaining Flying Fortress squad members to the Social Affairs Bureau, using steel shields as cover, and charged in. A mass brawl then broke out in the plaza, with scraps of paper and wooden blocks flying everywhere. As the stalemate continued, thirty to forty police officers were injured and fell to the ground. Dozens of dancers and staff were also knocked down and trampled, all of whom were rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment. Due to their numerical advantage, the dancers and staff fought even harder. Three police officers had their guns snatched away, but by evening, all three missing guns had been recovered. At that time, security police stationed at the North Station were ordered to come to reinforce and arrived at 4:40 PM. The entire force was divided into two groups, checking the identity cards, dancer licenses, dance association membership cards, and whether there was mud or blood stains on their hands to determine if they had participated in the vandalism. Those found to be suspicious or of unknown identity were immediately detained. After the detention, the staff members of the Social Affairs Bureau on site identified them one by one. The inspection lasted until 11:00 PM, and a total of more than four hundred men and women were detained and sent to various police branches for detention. A thorough interrogation was scheduled to begin this morning.

Dancers Weep and Claim They Were Forced

During the inspection, many dancers cried out in distress, claiming that they had been forced to come, as the organization had announced that those who did not participate would be fined 3 million yuan. Accountants, drivers, waiters, and even shoeshiners from various dance halls were also found during the inspection, and it was rumored that they were mostly forced to participate. Finally, Jin Baolong, an inspector from the Vienna Dance Hall, and Wang Zhenda, a sofa merchant who specializes in dance halls, were found in the ranks with pistols hidden on them. They were arrested for carrying weapons and participating in the vandalism.

Sun Zhimin and Meng Yan, representatives of the Dancers' Association, were also summoned for questioning last night. They denied participating in the vandalism. The police bureau stated that the facts were still under investigation and ordered them to be temporarily detained for questioning.

Top Officials Discuss Countermeasures; Sun Hongyuan Hands Over a List of Leaders from Both Associations; Commander Xuan Emphasizes Strict Handling

After the conflict ended, Commander Xuan arrived at the scene and immediately met with Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, Director Wu, and Director Zhu in the conference room of the Land Administration Bureau to discuss countermeasures. Chen Baotai and Zhu Xubai were also present. At 6:10 PM, police officers brought Sun Hongyuan, the chairman of the Dance Industry Association. Director Wu Kaixian questioned him: Why was the bureau not notified for approval before holding the general meeting? Sun replied that everything was decided by the presidium of the association, and the capitalists believed that it did not matter whether the dance halls were open or not. Commander Xuan then pointed out that the police bureau received the record filing letter when the general meeting had already started, so the meeting was held before the record was filed. Regarding the petition to the Social Affairs Bureau, Sun Hongyuan said it was at the request of the labor representatives. Director Wu Kaixian asked who proposed the petition in the general meeting, but Sun could not answer. Commander Xuan said that the dance industry was deceiving the police bureau in this matter. They reported to the police bureau that after the general meeting, they were prepared to go home and not parade or petition, but the result was that they went to the Social Affairs Bureau. Director Wu said with emotion: "I have always considered the difficulties of the dance industry. Someone in the central government is close to me and is 'condoning evil.' The ban on dancing was decided last September, but it has been delayed until now, so that the dance halls can have a chance to make money. But the dance industry repays me by destroying the Social Affairs Bureau! Recently, in the municipal meeting, I even suggested that half of the dance halls should be banned by lottery, but the dancers should not stop working by half, in order to maintain their livelihoods." The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM and decided to instruct Sun Hongyuan to hand over a list of all the responsible persons of the Dance Industry Council and the Dance Industry Workers' Union for interrogation. Commander Xuan also strongly emphasized that this matter must be handled strictly, "otherwise, the local authorities will never be able to implement the central government's orders. Students can insult local administrative officials, and dancers can destroy government agencies. This is not constitutional rule, but an insurrection. In the past two or three days, the international impression of our country has been extremely bad." At this time, the search work had begun on the plaza, and the meeting was adjourned. Except for Director Wu, the attendees left the Social Affairs Bureau one after another. The security was tight at that time, and when Speaker Pan left the scene, he first stated his identity, and then the police officer used a radio transmitter to ask for instructions before releasing him.

Prosecutors Arrive for Inspection

After the dancers destroyed the Social Affairs Bureau, Director Wu immediately called Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang of the District Prosecutor's Office. Chief Prosecutor Huang immediately dispatched all prosecutors to the scene to investigate. Mr. Quan, the prosecutor, arrived at the Social Affairs Bureau at 5:00 PM, inspected the interior for a week, and collected various material evidence. He left the Social Affairs Bureau at 7:00 PM and reported the situation to Chief Huang for future reference in investigating the case.

### Tense Scene at the North Station; Student Groups Return to Shanghai for the New Year; Alarming a Large Number of Military Police on Alert

[Report from this newspaper] After the student unrest at Tongji University occurred, the authorities paid close attention to student movements. Yesterday, it was suddenly reported that hundreds of students from Jinling University in Nanjing were coming to Shanghai on the fifth train to comfort the students of Tongji University and others. The authorities immediately dispatched a large number of military police to the station for protection. Yu Shuping, director of the police bureau, Wang Zhaohuai, director of the police affairs department of the railway bureau, Ouyang Zunquan, director of the general affairs department of the municipal government, Ju or Wen, deputy director of the training council of the Ministry of Education, and Lu Dagong, section chief of the police bureau's security section, all rushed to the North Station in time. The railway bureau prepared three large buses for the students of Jinling University to ride in. At 4:00 PM, the train entered the station, and the atmosphere at the station suddenly became tense. The students on the train craned their necks to see the situation and were all surprised. The railway police department immediately sent personnel to find student representatives. According to the students, they were 380 students from Shanghai from the two campuses of Jinling University, male and female, who were collectively returning to their hometowns for winter vacation, and were led by Training Director Wei Zhongchao. Mr. Wei immediately assured Director Yu and Deputy Director Zhou that they were indeed students returning home and had no other actions. All the students were invited by the railway bureau to take the large buses and were sent home separately. The students were extremely happy to receive this unexpected preferential treatment, and the military police at the station were withdrawn.

Director Wu Speaks; Director Wu told reporters afterwards: "This handling of the ban on dancing has been extremely cautious beforehand. The method of phasing out the ban was approved by the municipal government meeting and filed with the Executive Yuan. All parties believe that these methods take both sides into account and are quite satisfactory. Yesterday, the rioters did not present their reasons through proper channels of request, but resorted to gathering mobs and publicly destroying administrative agencies, and dared to assault guards, disregarding the law. It is obvious that this is an organized action by bandits. In addition to actively reorganizing and continuing to work as usual, the municipal government and the garrison headquarters will strictly investigate to maintain order and enforce the law. The ban on dancing will be strictly enforced in accordance with the approved methods, without hesitation." Yuan Wenzhang, director of the fourth department of the Social Affairs Bureau, also expressed the following opinions from his position: "The essence of this matter is a public security issue, so the police bureau is responsible for handling it. The chairman of the Dance Industry Association and the chairman of the Dance Hall Workers' Union were both searched in the kitchen of the Social Affairs Bureau and were detained by the police bureau. As for whether there are suspects who instigated the crime, they are being interrogated. The Social Affairs Bureau did not demand compensation from the dance industry for the losses suffered yesterday. As for whether the dance halls will be open today, we have asked the mayor for instructions. The ban on dancing is still being phased out, and there is no basis for the rumor that it will be changed to a one-time ban. The Social Affairs Bureau also has no such proposal."

President Zhang's Instructions; The central government has also received reports on this incident. Since Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan jointly sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan President Zhang at 5:40, President Zhang was furious upon receiving the report and immediately instructed on the phone that the ringleaders must be given the most severe punishment.

### Dong Xian Guang Holds Tea Party; Receives Private Film Producers

Luo Xuelian, Du Tongsun, Jin Xiangluan, Fang Yizhi, Ren Zongde, Zhou Bodong and others provided opinions and unanimously supported the government's command to quell the rebellion and suppress the bandits.

### Traitor and Fierce Thief Case; Arrested in Shanghai from Changzhou

[Report from this newspaper] Li Ruiying (also known as Jian Yue), a 27-year-old traitor from Changzhou, lived in a flat in Shihui Creek, Songpan Road, Pudong. He committed numerous crimes in Wujin County and fled to Shanghai, where he committed theft. Feng, the director of the Yulin Road Police Branch, received a secret report a few days ago and ordered Section Chief Shen to investigate. Finally, at 3:00 AM on the 24th of last month, staff member Cheng Wengui led police officers Li Canyin and Cheng Yuguang to his home and took them to the bureau for questioning. According to his confession, there was also an accomplice named Li Arong, 27 years old, from the same hometown, who lived at 499 Zhongshan North Road, and was arrested together.

### Working Overtime to Organize Files; Everything Expected to Return to Normal Tomorrow

[Report from this newspaper] Although today is Sunday, the Social Affairs Bureau has decided to work overtime to organize files. It is expected that everything will return to normal from tomorrow. Yesterday, when the bureau was vandalized, the file storage room on the third floor was blocked with rice by employees after hearing the alarm, so the bureau's files, except for those already submitted by various departments, were fortunately spared. However, the industrial and commercial registration cards of the first department and the grain merchant registration cards of the fourth department were all robbed and scattered. If there are no copies, it will take a lot of time to organize. The bureau's archives were also not robbed yesterday because the employees turned off the lights in the warehouse when the crowd rushed in. The crowd did not identify them in a hurry, so they were spared. In addition, the office of the fourth department of the Social Affairs Bureau was preserved due to the wit of a few staff members who temporarily wrote the words "Land Administration Bureau" on the door wall with white chalk. The destroyed offices of the bureau included the director's office, the deputy director's office, the director's conference room, the secretary's office, the conference room, the general affairs section, the copying room, the labor-management arbitration committee, the director's office of the first department, the price management section, the food section, and the industrial and commercial registration section. The agricultural, forestry, fishing, and cooperative section and the statistics room of the first department were spared because they were located in a remote corner and were not noticed. The total loss is impossible to estimate.

Director Wu Escapes Danger

At that time, the door of the director's conference room was locked, and the labor-management evaluation meeting was temporarily suspended. The crowd swarmed in and smashed the glass door of the aisle. Two dancers even used wooden sticks to smash the main door of the director's conference room. Chen Ziyun, the bodyguard of Speaker Pan who was standing in front of the door, stated that he was an employee of the Senate, but the back of his head was still hit hard by a dancer with a broken chair leg. After the door was broken, the crowd entered the director's conference room. At that time, Director Wu had been guided by a staff member to retreat through a small door to the Land Administration Bureau. Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, and Zhao, the consultant of the Social Affairs Bureau, persuaded the dancers and staff not to act so recklessly. If they had any complaints, they could push representatives to state them in person. However, the participants in the vandalism acted arrogantly. A part of the dancers cried and screamed, shouting "We want to eat, you don't give us food," and held broken chair legs or wooden sticks in one hand. When they saw glass, lights, and other objects, they smashed them even harder. All the objects in the room were also destroyed. The police officers of the 11th group of the Flying Fortress squad rushed in with bayonets, and the crowd retreated slightly. Later, the 23rd batch of security police heard the news and rushed to the scene. Lu Dagong, the section chief of the police bureau's security section, ordered the bayonets to be taken down and held hands with each other, forcing the crowd to retreat to the two corners of the square, with the dancers in the south and the staff in the north, surrounded by a group of people. Seeing that the situation was no match, the crowd began to throw away the wooden sticks, and the atmosphere immediately eased. A conflict that lasted a total of 42 minutes ended here.

### Checking and Detaining Suspects in Batches

After 6:00 PM, the police officers divided the crowd at the scene into dancers and staff. The directors immediately reprimanded them, saying that the Social Affairs Bureau was doing its best to solve the difficulties of the dance industry, but today the dancers came to attack the Social Affairs Bureau, and the chairman of the association should be held responsible. Speaker Pan's attitude was also quite激動, saying that the Senate had sympathized with the difficulties of the dance industry in the past. If the dance halls had legitimate reasons today, they could take the proper route and have the Senate convey them to the local authorities. Today's actions were completely violent, and they should know that the Communist Party has a whole plan for Shanghai, and the dance industry has been used by them. Sun Hongyuan also knew that the situation was serious at this time, shaking his head, but his attitude was still calm and constantly defended himself. Director Wu

### Xinjiang Problems: Thirty Years of Shadows and Future Prospects

— Special Correspondent Ma Cibo

[Dispatch from Dihua, January 24th] The evolution of Xinjiang's politics, leaving aside the distant past, only focusing on the thirty-odd years from the establishment of the Republic of China to the Yining Incident, Xinjiang never lifted her veil, seemingly maintaining her mysteriousness as an Asian virgin land. Apart from a few internationally renowned archaeologists who conducted exploratory excavations, the Chinese people have always been unclear about this own land and millions of their own compatriots. Yang Zengxin's seventeen years of non-interference, with a focus on frugality and clarity in governance, can be considered a prosperous era. The common people still remember him fondly to this day, but he only acknowledged the temple and not the god in relation to the central government, obeying control but not transfers. Although nominally a province of China, the actual administrative power had its own style, operating independently. Jin Shuren generally continued Yang Zengxin's legacy, but his talent was inferior to Yang Zengxin's. Although the situation of being close to and distant from the central government remained the same, internal corruption led to ethnic conflicts and social unrest, thus opening the source of chaos in Xinjiang. The people suffered greatly. This was a case of heroes emerging in times of trouble. Under the weakness of Jin Shuren's regime, two adventurers, Sheng Shicai and Ma Zhongying, emerged due to opportune circumstances. Xinjiang's final situation became a battleground for Sheng and Ma's struggle for dominance. Their tug-of-war for hegemony lasted for half a year, showcasing some spectacular performances. Although Ma Zhongying was brave and good at fighting, once creating the masterpiece of besieging Urumqi, he was ultimately no match for Sheng Shicai, who had studied in Japan and traveled the Trans-Siberian Railway and had international vision. Sheng Shicai used foreign aid to defeat him. When Ma retreated to Kashgar, he still held half of southern Xinjiang, showing a trend of splitting the territory equally with Sheng Shicai. However, in the end, because he did not understand the game of "politics," he fell into a trap and walked into a snare himself. In a certain month of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), Ma Zhongying, with a chivalrous spirit akin to a Chinese forest hero, entered Moscow and has not been heard from since. He abandoned a group of partners in adversity, who awaited his return every day, conjuring up many rumors, but he has permanently become a mythical figure.

Sheng Shicai's Rule: Mysterious, Terrifying, and Unpredictable

After Sheng Shicai took power in Xinjiang, seeing through the weaknesses of the era, he simply acknowledged the thief as his father, making Xinjiang not only mysterious but also terrifying. He vigorously promoted his grand policies, and in his legal code, the word "motherland" could no longer be found; he was the leader of the Xinjiang people. The international fortifications at Xingxingxia had their gun barrels pointed eastward, and foreign troops were stationed in Hami. Han Chinese should not ask who owns the land west of Yangguan Pass. Everyone found the Xinjiang problem even more unfathomable and could only sigh in vain.

Strangely enough, things often turned out unexpectedly. When the flames of the Pacific War were raging fiercely and the battle for Leningrad was in full swing, Sheng Shicai suddenly made a 180-degree turn, returning the entire territory of Xinjiang to the nation in its entirety. It can be said that Sheng Shicai's ten years of rule in Xinjiang were filled with evil deeds, but one good deed was enough to offset a hundred evils. He ultimately did not allow the territory to change color. He became a Xinjiang warlord and also knew how to trim his sails to the wind, which proves he was not ignorant of current affairs. Since Mr. Sheng generously withdrew from Xinjiang, flying to Chongqing to take up the post of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and leaving his throne, the mysterious veil of Xinjiang was lifted, and the people of the whole country could breathe in some fresh air about Xinjiang. However, the political situation and customs of Xinjiang and the interior had been completely isolated for more than thirty years, and the general knowledge of Xinjiang among the Chinese people was indeed too shallow. At the time, we failed to recognize the significance of Xinjiang's return to the motherland as equivalent to shedding its skin and changing its nationality, considering it an important interlude in World War II. Therefore, when the Yining Incident occurred, everyone initially underestimated it. Furthermore, the enemy's propaganda, cloaked in political and ethnic garments, was truly dazzling and misleading. In fact, the content of the incident was very simple. It can be said that without Sheng Shicai's change of heart, there would have been no Yining Incident. The Yining Incident was an inevitable reaction after Xinjiang's return to the motherland. Therefore, we do not need to delve into the causes of the rebellion, nor do we need to conduct a detailed study of the historical relationships, political connections, and nationality issues of the key figures leading the rebellion. Instead, we must recognize that the Yining Incident was a "international debt" left behind by Sheng Shicai. Therefore, the evolution of the political situation in Xinjiang that we have seen in the year since the peace agreement has been nothing more than haggling over this "international debt." The responsibility for the Yining Incident cannot be entirely attributed to the authorities in power at the time. At most, it can only be said that they were unclear about the situation and did not take adequate precautions. As for the inevitable occurrence of the rebellion, it was directed by an international conspiracy. Therefore, today, if we want to understand the crux of the Xinjiang problem, we only need to analyze the rise and fall of a specific political ambition in Xinjiang after the peace negotiations, and we can understand its general outline. To solve it, they demand pro-Soviet, democratic groups, and the standards of unity will have unlimited development and transformation. General Zhang Zhizhong, in order to achieve genuine peace in Xinjiang, took on a heavy burden with a spirit of great courage and resolute style, and agreed to all the harsh conditions put forward by the Yining side. General Zhang only made one request to them, which was for the people of Yining to support the nation. Regardless of pro-Soviet, democratic, peaceful unity, they must all be implemented within the unified national administrative framework. Speaking of being pro-Soviet, China and the Soviet Union fundamentally have a friendly agreement, which the whole country can implement. Xinjiang certainly cannot be an exception and cannot have separate pro-Soviet clauses. Democracy is the trend of the times, and Xinjiang should naturally catch up. Xinjiang is the most ethnically diverse place, and without unity, there can be no talk of peace. Xinjiang borders the Soviet Union for thousands of miles, and without being pro-Soviet, there can be no talk of peace. Xinjiang is the territory of the Republic of China, and if it wants to secede from the nation and become a separate entity, there can certainly be no talk of peace. Without peace, there can be no construction. Without construction, there can be no progress. This is a self-evident truth. General Zhang used this reasoning to persuade them, but the Yining side always felt aversion to the concept of "nation," believing that it was a Han Chinese thing and had nothing to do with them. Therefore, the many difficulties encountered in the peace negotiations were mostly focused on the two words "unity."

After the peace agreement was signed, General Zhang said to the people: "Now they want everything, only not the nation. If they want anything, I will give it to them. One day, they will want nothing but the nation. Recognizing the nation is their final destination." Indeed, without this magnanimous spirit, one would not be qualified to solve the Xinjiang problem.

During the first celebration party for the success of the peace negotiations, General Zhang first raised his glass to thank Mr. Savelyev, the Soviet Consul General who mediated the negotiations. He said, "Without Consul General Savelyev's reconciliation, peace in Xinjiang would not have been achieved." His smiling face contained boundless bitterness. He swallowed the blood from his broken teeth and drank the toast of gratitude. Only he knew the truth about the rise and fall of the nation. (To be continued tomorrow)

[Dispatch from Suzhou, January 29th] The famous Suzhou tea, pastry, and candy store Shouhe was previously resented by Fang Zhiyan, and he reported that small boss Ye Bingzhang had instigated the falsification of accounts to evade national taxes, amounting to hundreds of millions of yuan.

Therefore, a public prosecution has been filed against him.

### Conscription Work Progressing Smoothly

[Dispatch from Nantong, January 28th] The first phase of conscription in this county, after reducing the quota, has been decided to be completed by the end of this month simultaneously with the emergency conscription quota.

### Opening the Door to Peace: Concentrated on Three Focuses

The Yining small court, with an international background, political ambitions, and arrogance, attempted to implement its treacherous plans and demanded harsh conditions, making the difficulties and twists and turns encountered in the peace negotiations unimaginable to outsiders. At that time, General Zhang Zhizhong, the representative of the central government, with the purest sincerity and the greatest patience, had dozens of discussions with the four representatives of the Yining rebel people, experiencing several breakdowns and several resumptions. The most serious one lasted for more than a month without any negotiations. Everyone was worried that the somber atmosphere would be difficult to break. However, General Zhang still had extraordinary political cultivation. He never changed his attitude and continued to use his patience and sincerity to influence the other party, finally enabling the peace agreement to be signed on June 6th of the 35th year of the Republic (1946). During the negotiations, it can be said that everything was discussed, and all hypocritical facades were torn away. The problems were concentrated on three focuses: diplomacy, ethnicity, and politics. General Zhang Zhizhong had already developed a clear plan for solving these problems. Shortly after entering Xinjiang on May 7th, he published a proclamation on building a new Xinjiang based on the Three Principles of the People, putting forward the four slogans of democracy, peace, unity, and unification. The solution to the problem ultimately did not exceed the scope set by General Zhang. From the peace agreement to the policy program, the entire content was nothing more than advocating pro-Soviet relations in diplomacy, implementing democracy in politics, practicing ethnic unity, and ensuring national unification. The common goal for everyone was to achieve peace, stability, and construction in Xinjiang. These are such grand and righteous political slogans. If there were no special intentions on the dark side, General Zhang Zhizhong's policy for governing Xinjiang would truly be a legitimate and reasonable political reform. However, the reality is not so simple. The Yining side believed that the signing of the peace agreement was the beginning of the problem, not the end of the problem.

### Whether Tongji University Will Be Dissolved Depends on Tomorrow's Resumption of Classes: The Competent Authorities Are Closely Monitoring

He further explained that he had sent a letter to the municipal government to bail out the arrested students and denied rumors that a second arrest had occurred. As for the police officers remaining in the hospital, they will be withdrawn after the school returns to normal. The students then passed a motion to send representatives to express their condolences to the mayor and apologize. Most of the students who did not resume classes at the school yesterday did not dare to return to school due to concerns. President Ding will issue a notice today, hoping that the students will return to school immediately. The authorities will certainly not implicate the innocent. Zhou Huowen, deputy director of the Guidance Committee of the Ministry of Education, met with reporters last night on behalf of Vice Minister Hang and said that, according to President Ding, the attendance of students today was good.

Vice Minister Hang has instructed President Ding to strengthen the roll call when classes resume next Monday and send Advisor Yin Sun and Yu to the school for inspection. If all classes can be resumed, the issuance of a dissolution order may be considered.

### City Government Information Office Releases Account of Mayor's Assault

[Report from this newspaper] According to the City Government Information Office's announcement yesterday, the truth about Mayor Wu being assaulted and injured on the 29th of last month while mediating a student strike at Tongji University is as follows:

When the crowd surrounded the Mayor, someone shouted, "Don't hit the Mayor!" But at this time, someone had already grabbed the Mayor's throat, one person was holding the Mayor's waist, and another person knocked off the Mayor's hat, smashed his glasses, and struck the Mayor's head on the left and right temples with two blows, dragging him to the ground. At this moment, someone shouted, "The police are hitting people!" The Mayor immediately said, "Let me get up and give the order, do not allow the police to open fire and shoot people!" Before he could finish speaking, someone shouted again, "Don't let him get up!" This voice was exactly the same as the voice saying "The police are hitting people," and it clearly came from the same person. This is evidenced by the handwritten confession of Feng Liwen, a student of the Tongji University Law School (Deputy Standing Director of the Student Self-Government Association of the school), after being detained: "When I came back to read Mr. Huang Boquan's written nameplate to my classmates, the crowd clashed with the police, and people scattered to both sides. I shouted loudly, 'Don't hit the Mayor!' I also fell to the ground at the same time. When I woke up from lying on the ground, I heard the words 'Don't let him get up.' Fearing being injured by stones and cavalry, after getting up, I immediately ran to the left. I didn't see who shouted 'Don't let him get up' and who hit the Mayor. I heard the Mayor say, 'Police, don't open fire' in the crowd." Further evidenced by the confession of Huang Lu, a student of the Tongji University Engineering School (one of the Presidium of the school's Beijing Petition), after being detained: "When the beating occurred, because the order was chaotic, the Mayor was beaten, which is a fact. But there were too many students from various schools, and I can't remember who did the beating. However, our Presidium often neglected our responsibility for protection. This is just my personal opinion, and I don't know if other Presidium members acknowledge this responsibility."

In addition, Cai Mingde, a student of the Tongji University Engineering School, also shouted in his confession, "I saw the Mayor being hit with two blows." Also, Xue Yukun, a student of the Engineering School, stated in his confession, "I am very happy that the Mayor came to help us solve the problem. There is no reason to hit the Mayor at all. Of course, it was the work of bandits, which can be investigated." This is sufficient proof that Mayor Wu was indeed assaulted by bandits.

The total number of graduates from the above ten schools is 180 junior high school students, 98 senior high school students, and 152 college students.

Oppose Destruction and Support Construction

Zhang Yi, President of Fudan University, gave a speech to the graduating students, encouraging them in three points: Replace destruction with construction: The meaning of life lies in leaving behind something of contribution or construction to human society, so that later generations will be encouraged. Therefore, all destructive actions must be opposed and construction supported! Replace selfishness with service: Helping others is the source of happiness. There is no one more miserable than a selfish person. The happiest life is complete selflessness, dedicating all one's energy to hard work and struggle. Replace struggle with cooperation: There are love and hate in people's hearts. Cooperation is the expression of love, and struggle is the expression of hate. It is easy for friction to occur between people. The biggest difficulties at present are "division," "hatred," and "struggle." If you want to strive for leadership, you can only gain the faith of others through serving and cooperating with others. Today's country and individuals have three evils to eliminate. We should emulate Zhou Chu in ancient times, eliminate defeatism through construction, eliminate selfishness through service, and eliminate division through cooperation. If everyone seeks self-improvement, the country will surely prosper.

Skills for Independence Are Not Limited to Further Education

Acting Director Li of the Education Bureau also made a speech, stating three points: After graduating from middle school, it is not necessary to go to university. Students should not feel disappointed and lose their ambition just because they cannot enter university. You must know that skills for independence are not necessarily obtained in university. Supplementary education can also be obtained in companies, factories, or stores. Youth's patriotic emotions should not be blamed, but patriotic methods should be constructive rather than destructive. It is a fact that some political facilities are currently not good, but they should be improved gradually within the scope of the constitution through legal means, and not through bloody destructive means that would lead to instability in the entire country and society. Acting Director Li wished all students success in their studies or careers after leaving school. After the speech, certificates and awards were given, and representatives from each school received them in turn. Finally, the graduate representative gave a response speech. After the ceremony, students from the Physical Education College performed sports.

In this division, it has won all six battles, and teams such as Shantou, Renyu, Chenyou, as well as foreign troops such as Toronto Bianca, the US Military Police, and the US Air Force, have all fallen victim to it.

### Winter World Games Open; Ice Skating Sets World Record; Ice Hockey Dispute Resolved, Not Included in Competition

[United Press International, St. Moritz, 31st] According to unofficial announcements: American athlete Fitz Gerald broke the world record for the 500-meter ice skating event on the morning of the 31st. Fitz completed the course in 43.2 seconds, surpassing the world record by one-tenth of a second. [Associated Press, St. Moritz, 30th] The Fifth Winter World Games opened here today. The International World Games Committee announced tonight that ice hockey would not be included in the competition, a result of the unresolved dispute between the American team regarding twin brothers.

[Agence France-Presse, St. Moritz, Switzerland, 31st] Norwegian ice skater Helgesen won the 500-meter ice skating championship today, with a time of 43.4 seconds. [Agence France-Presse, Berne, Switzerland, 31st] The World Games Committee's decision yesterday to exclude ice hockey from the Fifth Winter World Games has been met with strong criticism in today's Swiss newspapers.

[United Press International, St. Moritz, Switzerland, 30th] The 1948 Winter World Games officially opened here on the 30th at the Aare Olympic Games. The twenty-eight participating nations marched in formation through the streets of St. Moritz on the morning of the 28th amidst ice and snow. The sun shone brightly under a clear blue sky, a rare occurrence in recent weeks, with the temperature at twelve degrees Celsius above zero. Thousands of athletes from various countries, dressed in neat uniforms, presented a magnificent spectacle due to their different national identities and appearances. The procession stretched for two miles, with many carrying sleds on their shoulders. The procession began at 9:15 AM Greenwich Mean Time, slightly delayed by forty-five minutes. Neither of the two American ice hockey teams participated in the procession, but the chairman of the American World Games Committee, Brown, and other senior officials led the American team, advancing steadily behind the Stars and Stripes. Twenty thousand sports fans lined the streets to watch, but the narrow streets were insufficient to accommodate them, creating a crowd more congested than at a major American football game. The few Swiss police maintaining order faced great difficulty. The scene was further enlivened by the presence of private cars, jeeps, shuttle buses, and horse-drawn sleds interspersed among the crowds, making for a dazzling spectacle. The list of players selected by the Football Committee to represent the city in the World Games football preliminaries has been announced. The team is scheduled to play a practice match against the West Union team at Yiyuan at 2:30 PM today to test their skills. Tickets are still available for 20,000 and 40,000 yuan. Sales will begin at 12:30 PM at the gymnasium. The lineups for the preliminary representatives and the West Union teams are announced as follows: Referee Wu Shouheng, Linesmen Zhang Le, Deng Xiaoliang.

World Games Preliminary Team: Li Yao. West Union Team: Zhang Banglun, Yan Shixin, Wu Qixiang, Qu Yongfu, Meng Yiliang, Gao Baozheng, Sun Jinshun, Li Yichen, Han Longhai, Xia Tixian, Wen Nuogan, Ivanov. West Union Team: Xu Erz, Lisi Fort, Hannibo Nuogulov, F. Aiw, Hua, Zhen Funilao Bustov, Glénas.

Gao Baozheng Fei Chunhua, Mai Lu Xika Luole Qu.

The city's representative team has decided to depart for Hong Kong from Shanghai next weekend. As a warm-up, they will play a practice match against the West Union team today. The twelve star players of the team are all top-notch players from Shanghai, a blend of the best from the Donghua and Kenbai teams. Their excellent coordination and well-organized lineup are unmatched. Today's match is nothing less than a pre-expedition flag ceremony. With the team's strength, they will surely defeat the West Union team decisively. The wonderful performance at that time is naturally expected.

The West Union team consists of top players from the Jewish and German sports teams. The strength of their midfield line is comparable to that of the representative team. Mai Lu Xi's right midfielder has abundant stamina. Tiel Fu Ni serves as the center back, coordinating the front and back. Hannibo has transferred to the West Union team and has a good reputation for his performances. In the forward line, the little blonde haired Labour Stoff, assisted by Edward and Glénas on the left and right inside forwards, and Karole Qu and Nuogulov on the wings, their strength should not be underestimated. It is expected that they will fiercely compete with the representative team.

### Six District Cotton Textile Association Dispatches Representatives to Exchange Views with Yarn and Cloth Control Committee; Chief of Competent Authority Expresses Sympathy for Matters Presented

[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday, the Six District Association, following the instructions of Chairman Yuan, sent five representatives to the Yarn and Cloth Control Committee to exchange views with the chief of the competent authority. The representatives presented the matters in detail, and the chiefs expressed considerable sympathy. It was also decided to discuss further next Monday.

Another News: The Six District Cotton Textile Association issued an opinion on Chairman Yuan's speech:

The members of our association have always strongly supported the government's policy of contract spinning and weaving, unified purchase, and unified sales. The representatives dispatched this time to present opinions to Chairman Yuan were, as expected, told that they would be considered and referred to the competent authority for joint study. However, in yesterday's speech, Chairman Yuan mistakenly regarded the well-intentioned suggestions provided by our association as an attempt to coerce and defy the government, and the wording was stern, which caused members to go to the association to question him. At the beginning of constitutional government, Chairman Yuan's expression is deeply regrettable. The crisis in China's textile industry under the threat of Japan's rise is serious and obvious to all. Chairman Yuan, in his capacity as the person in charge, instead believes that the declaration drafted by our association, explaining the crisis as "unnecessary worries," is a misunderstanding. As for the six points of our association's opinion, whether there is any intention of coercion, we now specifically disclose them in the newspaper to clarify the truth. As for the matter of resident factory commissioners, since contract spinning factories are specifically responsible, there are regulations to be followed, and in fact, there is no need to set them up, which is also the real situation. The current panic over raw cotton has long been recognized by all parties. The members of our association are concerned about the survival of their businesses, which are related to the national economy, people's livelihood, and social stability. Please note that there is no intention to create alarmist remarks. Now that Chairman Yuan has stated that there is absolutely no problem, the factories are very pleased to hear this. We only hope that the supply of raw cotton will be uninterrupted, so that the factories will not be forced to shut down, and thus trouble Chairman Yuan to "enforce the law."

In short, the members of our association support national policies and dare not lag behind. The issue today is how to unite from top to bottom, and for officials and the people to cooperate in order to jointly save this national industry from its deep crisis. As for personal gains and losses, we have long put them aside. What we hope is that the authorities will promote the spirit of caring for this industry and implement reasonable measures. The members of our association will naturally support them wholeheartedly.

Key Points of Opinions Provided by the Association

The following are the points presented by the Six District Association to the Yarn and Cloth Management Committee for adoption:

(1) For contract spinning of cotton yarn, the Committee should first allocate raw cotton and deliver the spun cotton yarn in installments.

Since the government entrusts factories to contract spin cotton yarn, it should first allocate raw cotton to facilitate contract spinning and delivery of yarn in installments. Moreover, the raw cotton reserves of various factories are weak and will soon be exhausted. If the Committee does not allocate raw cotton first, in case it is too late to help, and leads to shutdowns, serious consequences will inevitably occur.

(2) The amount of cotton and processing fees per piece of contract spun cotton yarn should be calculated entirely according to the original plan set by the General Administration, based on the standard of equivalent and identical American cotton, and with the original plan of September as the base period, calculated monthly with reference to various indexes.

It is found that the General Administration's plan to exchange 712.5 pounds of cotton for one piece of 20-count cotton yarn was set in September, and the cotton supplied was all American cotton. In the future, if the raw cotton used for contract spinning is the same American cotton, it should be calculated with the same amount of cotton. If the quality of the cotton changes, it should be calculated separately by increasing or decreasing the amount according to the actual quality. In addition, the value of various expenses that make up the processing fee is different, and the rate of change is different. If only the price of cotton is used as the basis for calculation, it will inevitably be inconsistent with the actual processing fee. Therefore, the calculation method should analyze its constituent factors (calculated based on the percentage of various expenses of 20-count cotton yarn in September of last year by the Former Spinning Adjustment Committee), with the original plan of September as the base period, calculated monthly according to various indexes.

(3) Contract spinning processing fees should be allocated twice a month, on the 1st and 16th of each month, according to the processing fee index of the previous month, in order to facilitate turnover. The tail of the monthly index must be cleared before the 5th of the following month.

The operating funds and all expenses of various factories usually rely on the sale of futures yarn to obtain funds first, in order to meet payments with goods. If the management method is implemented, the factories will not be able to sell yarn, and it will be difficult to turn around. They will have to rely on advance payments of processing fees for replenishment.

(4) The contract spun cotton yarn should be collected and handed over within the factory in principle, in order to standardize costs and avoid imbalances. Contract spinning factories are scattered in various places. If the location for collecting cotton and handing over yarn is concentrated in one place, the varying distances will affect the level of costs. It is better to collect and hand over at the factory in principle, in order to standardize.

(5) Yarn factories with outdated equipment have higher spinning costs, and the Committee should grant appropriate subsidies.

Yarn factories that were established for a long time mostly have outdated equipment, and the number of spun yarns per day cannot reach the standard. The Committee should grant appropriate subsidies.

(6) Factories are sometimes shut down due to power restrictions, and those that generate their own electricity are also affected by the sharp increase in power costs, which affects costs. The Committee should find ways to subsidize them.

Factories are forced to shut down due to power shortages, resulting in not being able to produce as much as possible, which greatly affects processing fees. For yarn factories that generate their own electricity, it is difficult to purchase fuel coal, and power costs exceed the budget. The Committee should find ways to remedy this.

Cloth and Yarn Weakness Returns; Cotton Prices Turn Firm

Yesterday's cotton yarn market was extremely weak due to the strict enforcement of the control policy. Although the money market tended to be relaxed, sales were sluggish due to the approaching end of the month. Domestic traders and reproduction manufacturers rarely adopted [cotton], and the selling sentiment was strong, with prices falling. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell by 1 million yuan compared to the previous day, to 57.8 million yuan. Other coarse and fine yarns such as 10-count, 16-count, and 32-count and 40-count all fell by 100,000 to 890,000 yuan.

Cotton cloth opened in the morning due to scattered sellers competing to enter the market, and prices rose again. A large number of Dragon Head fine cloth was traded at 1.63 million yuan, and Five Blessings fine cloth reached a maximum of 1.322 million yuan. Later, due to the opening of cloth by the Textile Construction Company, which supplied and sold in large quantities, powerful cloth merchants and dyeing factories successively competed for funds, and prices gradually fell. Until the end, each grade of 12-pound fine cloth fell by 1,000 to 5,000 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, serge and zhigong prices also fell by 20,000 yuan. The prices of other cloths also appeared to be weak.

Silk Trade Quiet

Yesterday's rayon market was slightly weak in the morning, and the afternoon's market was similar to the previous day. Asahi's 120-count glossy rayon opened at 87 million yuan with some transactions. However, because non-industry people sold due to capital relations, it declined. The closing price for immediate delivery was 6 million yuan, and the transaction price for Monday's payment in the afternoon was 7 million yuan.

Factory Yarn Yesterday's market was quiet, and there were few transactions at all levels. Because retailers had no appetite, there was also a lack of import and export among traders. There were only two or three bales of zero-lot transactions. The transaction prices and the asking prices at all levels were similar to the previous day.

Silk Goods Yesterday's market was stable. The immediate delivery price for the largest Huaqiang Zhensibei surface was 40.5 million yuan. However, due to the imbalance between supply and demand, the closing price dropped to 200,000 yuan. The one-week delivery price was 900,000 yuan. Since one-week delivery, the next-day market for quilt covers has been temporarily suspended. The asking prices for Da Ge Zi silk gauze were similar to the previous day, and there were also no changes in other goods.

### Although Grain Has a Source, Market Prices Still Rise Sharply; Raw Vegetables and Bean Oil Also Rise

The situation was chaotic, and there was no formal market price. High-quality Japonica rice stood out, exceeding the 1.5 million yuan mark.

Flour sales turned strong, rising by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Wheat bran followed suit, rising by 10,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales were flat, and cargo owners were firm, rising by another 20,000 yuan. Yellow beans were purchased by oil factories and local merchants, competing with each other, and the supply could not meet the demand, continuing to rise sharply by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Mung beans were slow to sell. Gao Ding was the second-slowest, and red beans followed suit, rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. There were not many cowpea transactions, leading to an increase of more than 10,000 yuan.

Red sorghum stocks have dried up, rising sharply by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Corn sales from the north turned smooth, soaring by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Sesame from Tianjin fell back, and sales from customers stopped, resulting in a nominally flat but actually weak market. Raw peanuts from the Guangdong traders were fragrant and dry, and local merchants were also eager, rising by more than 100,000 yuan.

The oil market's appetite strengthened, and prices continued to rise. Bean oil rose rapidly by 200,000 yuan, raw oil also rose by more than 100,000 yuan, vegetable oil soared by 200,000 yuan, sesame oil also increased by more than 100,000 yuan, and the price of wheat was stable.

Fine Yarn Mills Lack Raw Materials, Textile Construction Hopes for Emergency Relief

[Our Newspaper Report] The second session of the eighth meeting of the China Textile Construction Corporation was held at 3 PM yesterday, chaired by Chen Qitian. Four important discussion items were on the agenda: Raw Material Issues: Most of the Textile Construction equipment is for fine yarn, but the raw materials for fine yarn are currently only enough for two months. It is hoped that 100,000 bales of foreign cotton for fine yarn will be imported as an emergency relief. Fuel Issues: The government is trying to make it possible for 300,000 tons of Kaiyan coal to be shipped south each month. 30,000 tons of foreign coal will be ordered, and the Hubei and Hunan areas in the Yangtze River basin are also increasing production, so the fuel supply can be expected to move in the near future. Auditing Issues: The Executive Yuan has recently drafted two kinds of simplified auditing methods and management methods for state-owned enterprises. For the structural business of state-owned businesses, it is hoped that a post-audit can be conducted, and then the Textile Construction will send a formal letter to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review and approval. Treatment Issues: The National Economic Council recently passed a method of treating state-owned enterprise employees, which has an impact on the situation of factory directors of the Textile Construction. It is proposed that the government should reconsider it.

[Another News] In order to adapt to needs, Textile Construction has recently established a Suzhou office, a transport team (equipped with 50 to 100 transport vehicles and 20 iron and wooden boats), and plans to establish a technical research committee to cultivate technical talent.

The Bull Camp Collapses; Chinese Stocks Gradually Decline

Although Chinese stocks rose yesterday at the opening due to the residual momentum of the previous close, it was short-lived. The local labor strike at the Shenxin No. 9 Factory fueled the selling sentiment. The bull camps of large buyers Nos. 148 and 43 collapsed, and things got worse and worse. The decline could not be stopped, and a tragic drop ensued, ending in an unfavorable state.

The morning opened steadily. Yong Yarn entered the market with a small show of strength at 760 yuan and 775 yuan. After the opening, No. 148 continued to enter for immediate delivery, and No. 193 entered for deferred delivery, reaching high prices of 765 yuan and 779 yuan. Nos. 235, 185, 85, 61, 35, and 151 sold for immediate delivery, and Nos. 76, 207, 125, 197, and 60 sold for deferred delivery, forcing the price down to 736 yuan and 758 yuan, before slightly hovering. National Goods were listed by Nos. 106 and 175 at the limit up price. The outside interest rate was slightly lower, at 31.5 cents and 36 cents. Amidst the sound, Nos. 117, 231, and 202 came to sell for immediate delivery, but still could not support it, forcing Nos. 148 and 43 to come to cut their losses. A large investor, Mr. Ye, and others sold off the market, and things got worse. No. 193 sold for deferred delivery, and Nos. 152 and 71 also sold for immediate delivery. Near noon, there was no support, and the price fell to low prices of 705 yuan and 726 yuan before Nos. 157, 235, and 74 accepted cash, and the price rebounded to 715 yuan and 733 yuan. Nos. 155 and 130 sold again for immediate delivery, and No. 148 was still able to close, and the noon close fell again to 710 yuan and 729 yuan. Only National Goods were still at the limit up price, matches were flat, and everything else could not be supported. As a result, compared to the previous closing price, matches were still flat in terms of immediate delivery stocks, while Yong Yarn, Xinhe, Xinyi, Huayi, Xinguang, Jingfu, Annei, Zhabei, and Qinxing Zhongni fell by half a percent, Meiya, Xinhua, and Tongyi fell by 10%, and the rest suffered slight setbacks. In terms of deferred delivery stocks, Huafeng suffered a slight setback, while Yong Yarn, Meiya, Xinhe, Xinguang, Jingfu, and Qinxing all fell by half a percent. Various unlisted stocks off the market were still falling.

Hoarding Soybeans Will Be Punished According to Regulations

The city's Social Affairs Bureau has received an order from the Ministry of Food stipulating that grain merchants hoarding soybeans will be punished in accordance with the "Anti-Food Management Regulations." The maximum quantity is based on the weight of grain. According to the calculation, eight dou of soybeans is equivalent to one load of rice. Soybeans are raw materials for oil extraction and are necessities for people's livelihoods. Therefore, the Ministry of Food issued this order to prevent hoarding for profit.

Storage and Transportation Bureau's Wheat Can Be Imported Today

[Our Newspaper Report] The 8,000 tons of relief wheat handled by the Ministry of Communications' Storage and Transportation Bureau, loaded on the U.S. President Lines' Hawaii, transported from Galveston, USA, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday. Due to heavy fog at sea, navigation was difficult, and it could not arrive on schedule. According to news from the company, it will definitely be imported this morning and berthed at No. 2 and No. 3 buoys for unloading.

Summer Woolen Goods Sell Relatively Well

The woolen market is deserted due to weak actual sales, high interest rates, and the high prices under the current economy, resulting in weak purchasing power. All retail transactions have become desolate. All standards have therefore tended to be flat. Yesterday, except for summer goods, which were relatively firm, everything else formed a nominal flat but actually declining reality. Outerwear fabrics, thick fabrics, and Mac Arden, etc., have shrunk even more.

### National Bonds Rebound; Foreign Stocks Weaken

Government bonds rebounded yesterday. Tongbing opened at 65,000, rising from 63,000 to 72,000, and then leveled off slightly. 6 million were traded. Compared to the previous close, A, B, and E rose by 5,000 yuan, type C rose by 7,000 yuan, and Tongding also rose by 6,000 yuan.

Foreign stocks were slightly weak yesterday, with Hong Kong Electric slightly rising to 3.35 yuan. Foreign firms were buying, and securities firms were selling with enthusiasm. Yisha opened in the morning at 555,000, falling to 525,000, and then slightly traded. As a result, compared to the previous close, Jardine Matheson, Deutsche Bank, Industry, and Cultivation were still flat, while Yeguang Telephone fell by half a percent, and the rest of the stocks were slightly lower.

### Spraying Can and Cat

— He Ku

When a fire broke out in the east gate, neighbors busily carried buckets and containers, pouring water to extinguish the blaze. As everyone was frantic, exhausted, and the fire was still far from being under control, one person had a unique idea. He believed that such firefighting might endanger the nearby wooden houses that were already scorched but not yet ignited. Therefore, to prevent the fire from spreading, he proposed collecting 5,000 watering cans for "watering flowers" around the fire site to contain the flames!

I had just finished writing the exclamation mark above when a friend happened to come in. Seeing this passage, he said that such a thing was too obviously fabricated and had no basis in reality. I couldn't help but chuckle to myself. This was indeed fabricated, but it was based on a template, copied according to a format. The template was a recent United Press International dispatch: the American Cat Society planned to seek 50,000 cats in 39 states, as well as Canada, Costa Rica, and other places, and transport them to Europe to eradicate the rat infestation—to catch the rats that were competing with hungry Europeans for food.

I remember a short article published in this column some time ago: "The Destiny of Cats." When film producers temporarily borrowed several white cats from the zoo to play supporting roles and no longer needed them, the organizer used "appearance on the screen" as a selling point and sold all the cats at a price of $1.50 each. Otherwise, they would have been the perfect candidates for the Cat Society Chairman Connor Lick's recruitment.

However, what makes us suspicious is that if these 50,000 cats arrive in Europe and, by chance, several tens of percent of them are just filling the ranks, are utter lazybones, then not only will they not be able to eradicate the rat infestation, but they will also increase the severity of competing with hungry people for food. What then? If the collected cats are all good at catching rats, to the point that the rat infestation is eliminated one day, will these 50,000 cats continue to stay in Europe and compete with the hungry for food? Or will Connor Lick recall the elite troops, with each cat wearing a medal around its neck "for meritorious service"? The dispatch did not specify, and those as confused as I am cannot help but ask these two questions.

I do not know the specific details of the actual situation of the hungry people in Europe because I am ignorant and ill-informed. But since they are called hungry people, I imagine they certainly do not have food for the next day. Even if they keep a little, they generally would not leave it on the table overnight for the rats to feast on. Therefore, the object of the rats' competition for food in Europe is not the hungry people, but the "red mansions" reeking of wine and meat! In other words, only the "red mansions" would think of keeping cats to catch rats. The hungry people would not feed their only black bread to a cat, so that it could energetically catch the rats that steal the black bread at night! This is another "haha" after "lending 100 yuan to a country in need of relief."

### Housing Lottery Tickets

— Nian Hong

Housing charity lottery tickets have become a topic of conversation for lower and middle-class citizens in their spare time. Civil servants, teachers, clerks, and even students and workers all have a ticket in hand, harboring boundless hopes for this piece of paper, which is printed as finely as an item costing twice the 5,000 yuan in customs gold. Don't underestimate it, it may be worth several gold bars in the near future. Of course, 100,000 yuan is nothing to speak of, but for people who earn just over a million a month, they would have to save for one or two months to scrape it together. Three or four colleagues casually chat, starting from salary increases, adjustments in treatment, and annual bonuses, and finally, when everyone sighs, they can't help but pull out that lottery ticket. Then, a surge of hope sweeps through their hearts, and the topic turns to housing. Perhaps A has a girlfriend and is worried about not being able to find a house, B has a new baby and the small room is too cramped, and C, although single, knows that a house is money, and isn't he going to have to pay back a considerable loan in the next few years? Buying one more lottery ticket means adding one more point of hope. Instead of taking the tram every day, they walk to work. They buy one less pound of milk powder for the child and make do with milk biscuits. They even stay up one more hour to write an article. As long as they are lucky enough to win, they can take a rickshaw to the office, buy cod liver oil and beef juice, and even light a pot of charcoal fire on a cold night.

This is truly a "win-win" good deed. Many people are making such judgments about housing charity lottery tickets. Winning the lottery is naturally something to celebrate, and even if one doesn't win, it's like making a donation, and the beneficiaries are still fellow countrymen in distress.

There is one hope in hundreds of thousands of lottery tickets, and millions of people yearn for this one hope. The probability of winning is almost zero. The hope of one or two lucky people is realized, while the hope of thousands upon thousands of people is dashed. But what does it matter if hope is dashed? 100,000 yuan is not enough to eat a Western meal, not enough to drink a sip of foreign wine. But it is enough to take the public bus for a month. In the weather of December, the northwest wind is mixed with snowflakes, isn't the public bus warm and fast? It's enough to eat one more ball of Cifan in the morning. It's really not a good feeling to go to the office on an empty stomach. It's enough to buy a pound of milk powder for the child. Isn't the child as thin as a monkey?

Relief is a good thing. As the end of the year approaches, it's best to say less about disappointing things. I wish everyone good luck and may you win a top prize!

### Governing by Knots

— Wang Baili

It is most appropriate to use idioms according to the occasion, such as "Cangjie created writing" at the Cangjie Temple and "Prime Minister's Shrine" at the Zhuge Kongming Shrine. During the Qing Dynasty, Mr. Gui Yuangong of Kunshan was an eccentric scholar. He once wrote on his door on New Year's Eve: "One spear stabs out the poor ghost, and double hooks pull in the god." His unconventional behavior was often like this. People at the time called him "crazy." He was very poor, his clothes were so tattered that they could not be patched, and his chairs were so broken that they could not be sat on, so he tied them all with rope and wrote on his door during the Laba Festival: "Governing by knots." Everyone who saw it burst into laughter.

### Trying on New Clothes for the First Time

— Ji Mo

The shop assistant from the Western clothing store brought me the new Western suit I had ordered. I took off the old silk-padded robe and tried on the new clothes for the first time, feeling a sense of renewal all over my body. It reminded me of some small experiences with wearing Western suits, so I wrote them down as a record. Readers, please consider this a foolish person's small insight.

I remember when I wore my first few Western suits, partly because it was not long after I "converted" and I did not understand the "three mysteries" of wearing Western suits, and partly because at that time I did not have a deep understanding of the "difficulty of material resources." Therefore, when I wore Western suits, I was very casual, often stuffing many things in my pockets, such as cigarette cases, wallets, matchboxes, handkerchiefs, candies, and notebooks, making them bulge out. Once, I suffered a big loss. I put a bag of "chicken dumplings" made by a halal teahouse in my pocket, which aroused the appetite of mice and was bitten into two holes.

I also liked to put my hands in the pockets of the jacket and trousers, so that the clothes were easily deformed and the seams were easily torn. Many young people I have seen seem to have the same habit as me. Of course, they cannot leave people with the impression of neat clothing.

Furthermore, I wore my pants very low, and over time, even though the trouser legs were lined, they were inevitably worn out. The wool fibers on the edges of the trouser legs were torn open, making them look very ugly. In addition, I usually did not pay much attention to my sitting posture, sometimes straightening my legs and sometimes leaning back. After a week or two, the back of the pants became shiny.

Sometimes, I wore a new Western suit and went out, regardless of the bad weather, and came back soaked in the rain. There were also times when I wore a coat that was too small over a Western suit that was too tight in the shoulders. After wearing it once or twice, the Western suit inside immediately changed its shape.

In recent years, with the rise in prices, the gap between monthly salary income and purchasing power has widened day by day. It is becoming more and more difficult to buy a new Western suit, and the degree of cherishing it has also deepened. Currently, I have a total of five Western suits in my wardrobe, including the newly made ones, which look as good as new. The quantity is naturally very small, but as long as I pay attention to them at all times, I think they can be worn twice as long.

### Anecdotes about Jin Bihui

— Shu Yu

Speaking of the three words "Jin Bihui," everyone may still feel unfamiliar, but when mentioning the name "Kawashima Yoshiko," I think everyone will be more familiar. Originally, Jin Bihui was the daughter of Prince Su of the former Qing Dynasty, Shanshenqi, who had once reformed the Qing government, released Wang Jingwei, and later plotted to restore the dynasty but failed. He fled to Japan. She lost her father at the age of three, and her mother also died in martyrdom. Therefore, she was taken to Japan by Kawashima Naniwa, a Japanese who was entrusted with the important task of raising her, and gave her the name Kawashima Yoshiko.

Kawashima Naniwa had been treated generously by the Qing court, founded the Chinese police administration, and was a close friend of Prince Su. He was a pro-China "China expert." Because he had no children himself, he regarded Jin as his own, dressed her in men's clothing, taught her the art of riding and shooting, and often instilled ideas of Sino-Japanese friendship in extracurricular activities. Jin Bihui received strict patriotic education from her adoptive father from an early age, which laid the foundation for her future arrogance.

However, Prince Su's children were not limited to Jin Bihui alone (it is said that there were as many as ten, eight sons and two daughters). Initially, they were all entrusted to Kawashima. Jin was young and outstanding. On her fourth birthday, her adoptive father asked her what she wanted. She replied that she wanted the world, so she was valued by Kawashima. Therefore, he kept her alone by his side to raise her, and the other nine were scattered elsewhere to be raised. They did not meet each other on weekdays, and Kawashima did not even let Jin Bihui know about this. It was not until she was ten years old that her brother Xiankai told her that she was Chinese. When she was fifteen years old, the "September 18th Incident" occurred, and Japanese students in China questioned the Japanese government. The Japanese government arrested the students, and Jin also participated and was detained for more than three months before she was released. Only then did she realize that she was Chinese and planned to return to China.

In the spring of the 21st year of the Republic of China (that is, the year after the "September 18th Incident"), she was only a sixteen-year-old girl. One day after school, she secretly boarded a ship and ran to Shanghai. This was the first act of her complex and unpredictable social life after she left her family and school, and it was also a major turning point in her thinking in life. After living in Shanghai for four months, her half-brother Jin Bidong rushed to Shanghai from the Northeast and took her to Changchun (then the capital of the puppet Manchukuo, called Xinjing). It is said that she did not know until then that she was a descendant of the Aisin Gioro clan. Therefore, she ran to Rehe to visit the grave and went to the birthplace of Changbai Mountain.

In her "turbulent" life, she was deceived three times, which may not be well known to the general public, but they were all closely related to her fate.

The first deception, as mentioned above, was being deceived by Kawashima, so that she did not know her true origin until she was sixteen years old.

The second time she was deceived was when she was entrusted by her brother Jin Bidong to lead 5,000 troops to Changbai Mountain to plot to support the Qing Dynasty and welcome Puyi back to Rehe. However, because she had not contacted the Japanese military department in advance, she was bombed by Japanese planes and forced to disband. At that time, the commander of the Japanese army, Tada, feigned to provide military supplies and lured them back to Changchun in a special car, and the matter was shelved.

After that, Su Bingwen revolted, but she did not let anyone know. She only left a letter, flew a plane to Manzhouli, and parachuted down, intending to surrender to Su. When all the Japanese who had been detained by the Su army ran back to Japan, the Japanese army on the ground began a general offensive and tied her up, leaving her alone in the Su army. Because she was alert, she escaped from the Mongolian tent and went to Tianjin to open the "Dongxinglou" restaurant. The last time she was deceived can be said to be the most dangerous, and almost her life was lost by the insidious and cunning Japanese army.

Once, she had a falling out with Yamaga Kyo, the chief of the press department of the Japanese army's Beiping headquarters. Yamaga was originally Kawashima Naniwa's secretary, but he was later expelled. He abused the people and extorted money in Beiping, which Jin was very dissatisfied with. She suddenly came up with a "Japanese-style landlord's method" to punish Yamaga, greatly humiliating him. Yamaga harbored resentment and retaliated, issuing a "banishment order" to expel her from all of China. She spent two years in confinement in the Kyushu University Hospital in Japan.

Jin Bihui's lifelong dream was to use the power of Japan to restore the imperial cause of the Manchu Qing Dynasty. Her life's energy was also devoted to this. However, as a result of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Japan was defeated, and her dream was shattered like a bubble. She was arrested in Beiping on October 11, 1945, and has been imprisoned for more than two years. The Hebei High Court sentenced her to death for treason. She refused to accept the sentence and petitioned the Supreme Court for a retrial. She said, "Born in bewilderment, die in bewilderment, this is my life." Facing the strict national law, what "bewilderment" can she use again!

### Talking about Crying

— Yi Feng

There are different ways to cry. Crying with tears but no sound is called weeping. Crying with sound but no tears is called wailing. Crying with both tears and sound is called sobbing. However, when one slips of the tongue, it is all called crying.

Crying should be a genuine outpouring of emotion. When people encounter grief or sorrow, they often cannot help but cry, wail, and stamp their feet, venting their emotions. However, when they are overjoyed, their eyes often fill with tears, and they cry with joy.

However, crying is not something that men often do. There is a saying that "men's tears are like gold, and women's tears are like water." Although this saying contains feudal implications of valuing men over women, the actual situation is also like this. Women do cry a little more often than men, the reason for which is that men's emotions are more resistant to training and can withstand storms, unlike women, who are so fragile. However, there are exceptions. When encountering certain situations, perhaps men cry more fiercely and more painfully than women. That is the case of "a hero does not shed tears easily, only when he is truly heartbroken."

As far back as the Warring States period, Shen Baoxu begged for troops in the Qin court. He cried for nine consecutive days without eating or sleeping. As a result, he finally moved the heart of the King of Qin, who agreed to lend troops to restore his homeland, and only then did his crying stop. Shen Baoxu can be regarded as a person who understands the principle of crying. His constant crying was naturally a means, but on the one hand, it was because he had made a road with Wu Zixu, to fulfill the promise of "if you can overturn Chu, I will definitely restore Chu." On the other hand, it may not have been because his homeland was destroyed, and tears came from his painful intestines, and he was extremely sad. Otherwise, where would such lasting tears come from?

This story of crying occurred very early and was admired and praised by later generations because Shen Baoxu's crying actually brought rescue troops and achieved the wish of restoring the country. Later, according to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a hero like Liu Bei, when Lu Zijing was ordered to ask him to return Jingzhou, also used Shen Baoxu's method, exchanging Zi Jing's sympathy with a look of "urgent tears," causing him to "enter a treasure mountain empty-handed" and return in vain. This was due to Zi Jing's sincerity and kindness, and it can also be seen that the magic power of crying is great. No wonder that in the late nineteenth century, when European guns and cannons had entered China, there was still a Manchu, Wen Ti, who believed that crying could repel the enemy and wanted to be Shen Baoxu II. At the beginning, when Russia forcibly leased Lushun and Dalian, Wen Ti volunteered to go to Russia to argue, saying that he would cry bitterly and follow Shen Baoxu's example of not eating for nine days. If Russia insisted, he would immediately commit suicide, so that he could move Britain and Japan to help him. In his memorial, he also said, "This slave has no parents in the hall, and wives and concubines in the room. He has long had the intention of repaying the country with his death. He can die in his place and move the nations of the earth." Fortunately, Emperor Guangxu still had a little brain and did not allow it. Otherwise, this joke would have been a big one. It is also dangerous to be inflexible and not adapt to changing circumstances.

According to reports a few days ago, in the public trial of the Jiang Customs embezzlement case in Beijing, the three main characters, Yin Lansun, Zhang Baohui, and Yue Xinmin, all performed a "crying in court" scene. One was "tears streaming down, unable to speak," another was "speaking with a crying voice," and the last one was "silent tears." They all unanimously "regretted being tricked by merchants," which can be said to be extremely wonderful! However, regardless of whether they were "tears from painful intestines" or deliberately acting, their motives were the same, all wanting to show repentance with "tears" in order to move the compassion of the judges and reduce their crimes. Without knowing the law, it is difficult to violate it. Even if the judges are sincere and kind, they may not be able to do anything. "One wrong step will cause eternal regret." It is difficult to wash away with the water of the Yangtze River, so what can the tears do!

### Remembering Yue Ying

— Zhu Mei

Last February in Shanghai, I learned from my friend Ba Jin that Yue Ying had died, and had been dead for several years, and had died in Shanghai. I often think of him and always want to write something to commemorate him, because he was an ordinary person. Perhaps it is because he was an ordinary person that I miss him. Also, he was a very lovable friend among our friends. The first time I knew of him was in 1930 when I read his translation of "The Working Girl Madeleine" in the New Woman Monthly. I met him in Paris in 1932. At that time, he was living in a hotel in Billancourf. I can't remember how I met him, because none of my friends who lived with me in Arouil knew him. Since meeting him, I would visit him once every week until I left Paris for Brussels. After going to Brussels, I remember that we exchanged one or two letters. At that time, he was working in a glass factory near Billancourf. This glass factory specialized in engraving, that is, engraving on glass products. Most of the products were exported, mainly to England and the United States. He often told me that he wanted to raise some capital after returning to China and open a glass engraving factory. This is not only a profitable industry, but also an art. I encouraged him very much, but I forgot that China could not even make flat glass ash well, so how could we talk about such noble glass manufacturing. When we met, in addition to talking about engraved glass, we occasionally talked about reading, translating books, raising tropical fish, and some of his trivial romances. He raised two tropical fish, which were given to him by his factory owner. About half a year later, his tropical fish had bred several more. This was his most proud thing. He lived in France for more than ten years. He never married, but he had many girlfriends, and they were of all kinds, so I said they were some trivial romances. His health was very bad. According to my friend Ba Jin, he was not very successful in Shanghai after returning to China. He worked in some bank for some time, and also opened a restaurant for a while, which was beyond my expectations. He fell ill not long after returning to China, and died not long after. In France, glass engraving is an emerging industry. Not many French people understand this technology. At present, it is said that there is probably only one Chinese person, Yue Ying. After returning to China, he did not have a chance to develop his technology, which is a pity. It is not an exaggeration to say that Chinese society has buried him. In fact, Yue Ying is not the only one who has been buried.

### A Carefree Flower

— Chen Zhenyan

Chapter 9: Leaking Secrets (59)

Old Mrs. Zhang said, "Being so timid and hesitant, you can't get anything done." Yunqing said, "Mother, you have to think about it. If we tell Zhuzhai's father, even if he listens to us completely and prevents Zhuzhai from marrying Qihuan, and things are done, what will happen afterward? What will Zhuzhai think of us for ruining his good fortune? Furthermore, if others see this, they will think we orchestrated the whole thing. We'll be disliked no matter what. Why should we bother with this?" Old Mrs. Zhang said, "According to you, it's none of our business and we can ignore it. Then why are you sighing all day long? If you take it lightly, I won't be anxious either!" Yunqing listened and remained silent. Because she was only thinking in her heart that she couldn't show her face at this point. If she did, she would surely incur Zhuzhai's resentment, planting a bad seed, and there would be no good outcome in the future. She couldn't express this kind of hardship for a while, and she didn't sleep all night again. Finally, she suddenly thought that Fei Xiaobai was Zhuzhai's uncle, and Zhuzhai's father was very close to him. If he spoke, it would definitely be effective. Xiaobai's thinking is very detailed, and he will handle this matter very thoughtfully. Yunqing thought of Fei Xiaobai, as if she had found a savior, knowing that Xiaobai had to get up after 4 o'clock every day. That day, she waited until after 4 o'clock and hired a car to Fei's residence. Xiaobai had just gotten up. Xiaobai and Old Mrs. Zhang were also relatives. Yunqing used to love studying opera and often came to Xiaobai's house to ask for advice. Xiaobai liked her cleverness and steadiness, and cherished her very much. This day, Yunqing walked into the courtyard. Xiaobai was teasing the parrot on the veranda. He saw Yunqing coming in at a glance and smiled, "You came just in time. Help me. I taught her to sing 'Visiting Mother,' but she only learned one sentence and then stopped learning. You come, sing two sentences to tease him. You are a stranger, and your voice is crisp, he will definitely learn." Yunqing knew Xiaobai's temper, if he asked you to do something, you had to do it immediately, then he would be very happy. If you procrastinated, he would get angry and not ask you to do it. Today, she was full of sadness and had no mood to sing opera and tease the parrot, but she came here to ask Xiaobai for help, so she had to curry favor and smiled, "Which section do you want me to sing?" Xiaobai said, "Don't sing a section, just sing two sentences: 'The sun shines brightly, the spring is beautiful, and the birds sing happily'." Yunqing indeed sang these two sentences while turning her back. She only saw the parrot looking east and west, his two eyes, as if searching for something.

After the Third World War (Part 1) Translated by Xi Biwu

B: (To A) I don't think you've ever shut up since the Second World War!

Inner: Well, thank goodness we finally escaped this great catastrophe of mankind. Think about it, there are only three of us left out of 2 billion people in the world. We really shouldn't complain anymore. (He knocks on wood with his hand.)

B: I think we should discuss how to guarantee peace in the world from now on. There must never be war again in the world.

C: Of course, of course.

A: Speaking of fire, (takes out a box of matches from his pocket) this is our only source of fire. These eight matches...

B: (Anxiously) Have you searched everywhere carefully?

A: Of course, I have searched every major industrial area in the world. Do you know that all the cigarettes in the world are enough for us to smoke for 20 million years? Many cigarette factories have not been destroyed, but all the match factories have been completely bombed.

C: Is the fire in Madrid still burning?

B: What about Ankara?

A: Oh, they're still burning!

B: That's good, we can use this fire as a source of fire, we don't need matches.

C: Don't talk, they won't burn forever! Look at New York, it only burned for two years. We must discuss the match issue immediately, this matter is very important for the future!

B: There are more important issues to discuss here! For example, how should land be distributed?

A: That's right! We must discuss and decide on this issue. (To C) We elect you as the chairman of the conference.

C: Thank you for electing me. I have to accept this difficult task. I promise to do my best not to disappoint you. Let the debate begin now!

A: (Standing up) Everyone! The Third World War has devastated the entire world; only the three of us can live victoriously and defeat all evil forces!

B, C: (Echoing loudly) Long live the United Nations! Long live! Long, long live!

A: (Continuing) We who can survive this great catastrophe have a very important responsibility, that is, to obtain eternal peace and happiness for the whole world! (Sits down, B and C applaud enthusiastically).

C: Please state your land requirements. (To A) Which continents do you want to cut off?

A: The Southern Hemisphere, Africa, Australia and South America.

C: (To B) What about you?

B: Europe and Asia.

C: (Angrily) Then all that's left for me is North America!

A: Don't be silly, North America is the former location of the United States, the richest continent in the world; this continent originally had more than 170 million people, is it not enough for you alone?

B: Okay, Greenland is also for you.

C: No, these conditions are not negotiable!

B: Everyone be quiet, we must not let the crisis escalate. (To C) North America is large and rich, and it is protected by the ocean on both sides, how ideal! The reason I want Europe is because it is a strategic buffer to Asia, so I cannot give it up, this is entirely for the purpose of defending the border.

C: (To A) Then why don't you let me have South America?

A: I'm not stupid, and don't forget the strength I contributed to the final victory! (To be continued)

Telecommunications Q&A

Answered by Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau

[Juxin Company, Fangbang Road asks] Why is there noise in the phone from time to time? How to avoid interference? Why is it slow to connect with public telephones? Are there any financial difficulties?

[Answer] There is noise when the microphone and cord in the phone are damaged. If there is no dial tone or the sound is mixed after the earpiece is taken off, it means that the switchboard is busy. Hang up the earpiece and wait a while before calling again. Do not hold the earpiece for a long time or knock on the spring randomly, which may cause the switchboard to malfunction. The connection of public telephones is no different from ordinary telephones.

[Duan Dexing, Zhonghua Road asks] What are the procedures for paying the city telephone bill? Under what circumstances can a long-distance call be cancelled? What is the cancellation fee?

[Answer] In order to facilitate telephone users to pay their fees, the Bureau has entrusted all telephone fees to the following banks for collection from January 1948. Please go to the following locations to pay after receiving the bill: (A) Bank of Communications Hongkou Branch, (B) Bank of Communications Minguo Road Branch, (C) Trust Department of the Central Cooperative Treasury, and this Bureau at Yokohama Bridge, and the Bank of Communications Agency at the General Business Office on Fuzhou Road.
