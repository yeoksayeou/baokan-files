### The National Assembly Holds its Fourth Meeting: Chairman Personally Delivers Political Report, Ample Preparations Made in Economy and Military

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Chairman Chiang attended the National Assembly at 10 a.m. on the 9th, giving a concise report on the current economic and military situation. He also reiterated the important tasks of this session of the Assembly, urging everyone to fulfill their responsibilities and quickly accomplish the mission. The sixth group of the Presidium was on duty for the Assembly on the morning of the 9th, chaired by Zuo Shunsheng. The meeting commenced at 10 a.m. sharp. Secretary-General Hong reported that 2,597 delegates had registered, with 2,395 delegates in attendance. After Chairman Zuo Shunsheng announced the opening of the meeting, Secretary-General Hong invited Chairman Chiang to deliver his report. The Chairman, dressed in military uniform, entered the venue from the right rear of the platform. All the delegates in the audience spontaneously rose to pay their respects, applauding to welcome him. Chairman Chiang then proceeded to the podium to begin his report, which lasted for one hour and thirty-five minutes, eliciting applause more than twenty times. When analyzing the current economic and military situation, the Chairman used figures as concrete evidence, explaining that the economy and military were not in the crisis rumored outside. The government had made ample preparations and was determined in both finance and military affairs. No matter how the communist bandits propagandized, they would not be able to shake the fundamental foundation. The Chairman stated: Currently, the silver and gold stored in the Central Bank are worth approximately US$110 million, which can be used to recover all the legal tender. In addition, the foreign exchange position is worth US$180 million. Adding the US$400 million from the sale of state-owned industries and the US$463 million in American aid to be received soon, the total should be over US$1 billion. With such a solid financial foundation, there is no danger. Chairman Chiang concluded his military report by saying: There is absolute certainty of victory in suppressing the bandits. Within half a year, at least the area south of the Yellow River can be cleared. The Chairman particularly emphasized that this Assembly was convened in an extraordinary period, and its task was to implement constitutionalism and build the nation. It should remove obstacles to constitutionalism. The Assembly is being watched by people at home and abroad, and the communist bandits are repeatedly trying to sabotage it. Therefore, all delegates should strive to win the people's respect and trust, and not argue solely over the acquisition of power. They must not make a laughingstock of themselves for the communist bandits to exploit in their propaganda schemes. Finally, the Chairman stated that he hoped all delegates would review what he had reported. After the report, the Chairman left the venue, and the entire audience once again stood and applauded to pay their respects. Chairman Zuo Shunsheng then announced the adjournment of the meeting. When Chairman Chiang was reporting, government officials were all in attendance to listen, including Madam Chiang, Sun Ke, Dai Chuanxian, Zhang Qun, Wu Tiecheng, Wu Dingchang, Zhangjia, Xu Fulin, Yu Hongjun, Jiang Menglin, and others.

### Full Text of the Chairman's Report: Encouraging National Assembly Delegates to Work Together with One Heart to Eliminate Obstacles and Lay the Foundation for Constitutional Government

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The original text of Chairman Chiang's report at the National Assembly on the morning of the 9th is as follows:

Since the opening of this session of the National Assembly, it has been more than ten days. In these ten days, all the delegates have worked diligently for the country, which has enabled the Assembly to achieve many successes. Today, I would like to express my gratitude to all of you on behalf of the government. We are convening the National Assembly and implementing constitutional government in this extraordinary period of rampant banditry and social unrest. I think all the delegates must know that the significance of convening this Assembly is different from ordinary gatherings. It is a very important gathering. The first task of our Assembly, of course, is to implement constitutional government, lay a good foundation for constitutional government, and complete the construction of the country. And if we want the country's construction to be completed and the implementation of constitutional government to be smooth, we must first eliminate the obstacles to constitutionalism and eliminate the communist bandits who are destroying the foundation of the country and hindering the country's construction. All the delegates have been entrusted with the heavy responsibility of the people of the whole country to participate in this extraordinary Assembly. They should face reality, face the enemy, be united, and work together to eliminate the communist bandits and ensure the implementation of constitutional government. I believe that if our National Assembly can successfully complete its tasks, it will be equivalent to increasing our national army's strength by one hundred divisions for the completion of the suppression of the rebellion and the stability of the country. And the contributions of all the delegates to the nation and the people will surely be immortalized in the history of Chinese constitutional government in the future.

The issue that all the delegates are most concerned about today is naturally the current situation of the country, especially the military and economic situation. Here, I would first like to make one point, that is, at this time of high prices and difficult lives for the majority of the people, and when the communist bandits are constantly spreading rumors, threatening, and disrupting the hearts of the people throughout the country, the general public does not recognize the situation of the country, cannot distinguish between true benefits and harms, and thus shakes their confidence in the future of the nation and feels anxious about the fate of the country. In fact, this is entirely due to being poisoned by the propaganda of the communist bandits and becoming prisoners of the communist bandits in spirit, which is exactly what the ancient saying "frightening each other with the ghost of Boyou" means, spreading rumors and creating panic. This is exactly what the communist bandits are seeking. We must start from the fundamental point of view to understand the real situation and measure the long-term future of the nation and the people. Now I will explain the issues that you are all concerned about with facts:

Total Amount of Legal Tender Issued: Less Than Seventy Trillion; Total Value of Gold, Silver, Foreign Exchange and Marketable Materials Stored by the Government: Over 700 Million US Dollars, More Than Three Times the Legal Tender

First of all, what I want to explain to everyone is the economic issue. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, due to the destruction of the communist bandits everywhere, traffic has been blocked, industries and mines have been shut down, the majority of the people have lived in poverty, and production has shrunk, forming a phenomenon of economic imbalance. This is a fact, and we cannot but admit that the current economic situation is indeed quite serious. But has our Chinese economy reached the point where it is beyond salvation, as the communist bandits have claimed, and is about to collapse? Or are the various chaotic and uneasy phenomena in our economy today caused by our own psychology? To answer this question, today I can frankly tell everyone the figures of the national finance and economy. As of the end of last month, the total amount of legal tender we issued was less than seventy trillion yuan. However, the total value of the silver and gold currently stored by our government is approximately US$110 million. The total amount of foreign exchange stored by the Central Bank and other national banks and bureaus reaches US$180 million. The two items total approximately US$290 million. And last month, the State Council decided to allocate a portion of the factories of the Resources Committee, the China Textile Company, a portion of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, enemy and puppet properties, and compensation materials to the Central Bank, which can be marketed at any time, totaling approximately US$400 million. The two total US$700 million. If calculated at the current exchange rate, it can offset more than three times the total amount of legal tender issued. And the aid loan recently passed by the US Congress is not included. From this, it can be seen that our legal tender has very sufficient reserves and the financial foundation is very solid. The consolidation of the financial foundation proves that our economic foundation has not been shaken. The current panic and the belief that the economy is about to collapse are entirely due to being influenced by the propaganda of the communist bandits and their tools, losing confidence in the country, and thus creating a panic psychology that harms oneself. All of you will be able to dispel this unnecessary doubt by listening to my responsible report today. Since last year, I have been distracted by military guidance and have not given enough consideration to finance. As a result, some negligence has been inevitable in the methods and techniques of execution. This is my responsibility, but we have this foundation and we will be able to save the economic crisis and strive for economic recovery. I hope all the delegates will work together with one heart and one mind, trust the government, stabilize the hearts of the people, and take the lead in diligence and thrift for the people of the whole country. Then I believe that the economic foundation will become more stable day by day in the future, and the economic situation will improve day by day.

Explaining the Military Situation and Correcting Misconceptions

Next, I want to talk about the military situation. Now everyone sees the rampancy of the communist bandits and thinks it is a military failure. In fact, this is a misconception. It should be known that the real military action of the national army to suppress the bandits only began with the capture of Yan'an in March last year. Prior to this, the national army's response to the communist bandits' invasion was merely passive self-defense. The national army's contact with the communist bandits has only been a year and a half now. In this year and a half, the national army has achieved two important strategic goals. The first is to consolidate the key points of the national army so that the communist bandits cannot obtain external assistance. The national army recovered Chengde and Zhangjiakou in the 35th year of the Republic, and Yantai in September last year, completely isolating the communist bandits' land and sea external communications. This is the achievement of this goal. The second is to occupy the location of the communist bandits' headquarters, which is the recovery of Yan'an in March last year, which caused the communist bandits to lose their political base and had to flee east and west, becoming bandits. In order to achieve these two major goals, the national army certainly had to pay a considerable price and suffer considerable sacrifices. However, our sacrifices have important significance and have already dealt a major blow to the bandit army, so we cannot be considered a failure. This is what everyone must understand. Now I will explain the situation of each battlefield separately as follows:

Future Strategy in the Northeast: Eliminate the Main Force of the Communist Bandits

First, let's talk about the Northeast. Now the area occupied by the national army in the Northeast has shrunk, and the traffic has been cut off. This is because the bandit army has formed an advantage in military strength. Since the national army has been fighting in the Northeast, it has lost seven divisions before and after. However, except for the reorganized 49th Division, these seven national divisions are all temporarily formed three-regiment units. As for the regular national army, there is no major loss. In particular, the Second Army, the 53rd Army, the Sixth Army, the 71st Army, the 93rd Army, the New First Army, and the New Sixth Army can all stand firm and are healthy and undamaged. However, the strength of the bandits in the Northeast has indeed increased by one-third compared to before. Therefore, the situation seems quite serious. But as long as we hold on to several important strongholds such as Shenyang, Changchun, and Jinzhou, we will surely be able to guarantee that the Northeast will always be our national territory. These few strongholds must be held firmly, and they can certainly be held firmly. We must know that the meaning of failure refers to the elimination of the "basic strength," and the current situation of the national army in the Northeast is based on strategic changes, not due to the weakening of the basic strength. The past strategy focused on recovering lost territory, and the future strategy focuses on eliminating the entire main force of the communist bandits. In order to adapt to the new strategy, we cannot disperse our forces for comprehensive control, and our determination to recover the Northeast will remain unchanged.

The National Army in the North China and Northwest Battlefields Cultivates Fighting

Next, I want to talk about North China. Since the fall of Shijiazhuang, the 7th Division and the 12th Division of the Third Army have been eliminated. This is the first time our important city has fallen, and it is certainly a major loss for us. But except for the Third Army, all other troops in North China are constantly being replenished and strengthened. In particular, since Commander-in-Chief Fu has unified command, the armies in North China under his leadership are growing day by day. In the near future, I believe that this battlefield will certainly show good results. Therefore, we cannot judge the success or failure of the entire bandit suppression military based on the gains and losses of one place at one time.

As for the Northwest, the death of Liu Kan, commander of the 29th Army, in the recent Yichuan battle in Shaanxi was indeed a major loss for the national army. However, in terms of the entire military strength in Shaanxi, at most one-sixth has been lost. The remaining divisions and independent brigades under the First Army are still complete and healthy and are continuing to work hard to fight. And the 22nd Army, which defended Yulin twice and repelled the enemy's siege, is fighting bravely with fewer troops than the enemy, and is fighting on the spot, cooperating to exert our combat power. Therefore, there is absolutely no problem in ensuring the Northwest.

The Rampancy of the Communist Bandits in Central China is a Forced Flight

Furthermore, let's talk about Central China. In the area south of the Yellow River and north of the Yangtze River, it has been greatly disturbed by the rampancy of the communist bandits for several months. But it should be known that this is a forced flight of the communist bandits, not their original purpose. I can tell you that the communist bandits' disturbance of Central China will certainly prolong the time for suppressing the bandits a little, but the communist bandits' conspiracy will never succeed. The main purpose of the communist bandits was originally to occupy North China, but because the national army entered Shandong in June last year to suppress the bandits, Chen Yi's bandit troops could not resist, and planned to divide into two groups, one group fled back to northern Jiangsu, and one group took the road to western Shandong and fled to Hebei. However, at that time, it was raining continuously, and the Yellow River and the Grand Canal were rising sharply, and they could not cross them secretly. And after Liu Bocheng's group crossed the Yellow River to support Chen Yi, they were repeatedly intercepted by the national army, making it impossible for them to flee back. So they made the best of a bad bargain and fled to the Yellow River flood area and the Dabie Mountain area. The Dabie Mountain group was Liu Bocheng's troops. Everyone knows that Liu Bocheng is the most ferocious bandit leader among the communist bandits. At that time, he took six columns and fled into the Dabie Mountain area, vainly trying to use the Dabie Mountain area as a base, threatening the capital in the east and threatening Wuhan in the west, and clamoring that he would cross the Yangtze River to the south in May this year and enter Sichuan to the west in August. But after Minister Bai sat in Jiujiang and commanded the national army to launch a fierce suppression, his strength in the Dabie Mountain area is now only three or four scattered regiments. The rest cannot stand, and have all fled back to the Yellow River flood area, and are fleeing around everywhere. At this time, the people of Shandong and Henan certainly feel pain and hope that the national army will rescue them. But everyone should know that I will certainly eliminate the entire bandit group gathered south of the Yellow River within three to six months.

Mobile Use of Troops to Attack the Communist Army's Conspiracy

I never easily predict military affairs. Since suppressing the bandits, everything I have declared has been achieved as scheduled, such as the recovery of Zhangjiakou and Chengde, the capture of Yan'an, and the sweep of Shandong and Jiaodong. Everything that has been strategically decided has been completed within the time limit. Everyone should trust my plan, strengthen the confidence of victory, and also know that the past strategy was first to ensure the national defense strongholds, which has been completed and achieved, and second to rescue the people, and we had to focus on occupying land. And the future strategy must focus on defeating the main force of the bandit army. In order to attack the communist army's conspiracy to contain our army, some locations sometimes have to be temporarily abandoned so that we can concentrate our forces, use them mobilely, and annihilate the main force of the bandit army. When this strategy is implemented, some areas may inevitably have to endure temporary pain, but they will certainly be rescued by the group army sooner or later.

### Fu Zuoyi is Alarmed: The National Assembly Decides to Send Condolences

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Huaibei Bandit Suppression Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi was slightly injured in an accident when Ji Ningfei was flying on a plane. The National Assembly delegates are extremely concerned and decided to send a telegram of condolences. The telegram has been drafted by the Secretariat and will be submitted to the Assembly for approval before being sent.

### National Assembly Chronicle: A Day of Calm Seas

Our Special Report (April 9th, Nanjing)

It has been sunny and warm for days, and emotions have been agitated in the meeting place. Many procedural issues have been caught up in the entanglement of emotions. The eccentricity and chaos shown in the meeting on the 8th can be said to have reached their peak. Fortunately, the wind and rain lasted all night, and on the morning of the 9th, the fog was misty and the temperature dropped sharply by twenty degrees. Everything in the meeting place also calmed down. The entire process of the morning and afternoon meetings on the 9th was generally quite smooth. In the morning, Chairman Chiang attended and gave a report. His consistent prestige and frankness made the delegates unanimously convinced and listened attentively throughout. The meeting in the afternoon to discuss the rules of procedure and the organizational regulations of the proposal review committee was also harmonious and relaxed. The east wind was weak, and it wanted to frown but then stopped. On the morning of the 9th, everyone was excited about Chairman Chiang's attendance and report. Of the 2,579 delegates, only 202 were absent. In addition to Madam Chiang, there were a large number of government officials on the podium. After Hong Lanyou announced twice that Chairman Chiang of the National Government would deliver a policy report, the entire audience stood up, and the Chairman walked to the podium amidst applause, emphasizing the extraordinary task of the National Assembly. Then there was sincere applause, shaking the entire building of the Assembly Hall. Subsequently, he began the economic and military report. Chairman Chiang's one-and-a-half-hour report created order in the morning meeting, and his final thoughts and wishes simultaneously generated the effect of resolving entanglements in the fourth general assembly in the afternoon. At 3:40 p.m., Chairman Gan Naiguang, with the assistance of Hong Lanyou, began to continue discussing the rules. The people who stirred up the storm the day before were all silent. Only a few, because Gan Naiguang talked too much and became more and more entangled in the explanation, caused a small wave. The second half of the sixty-six rules of procedure and all nine organizational regulations of the proposal review committee were smoothly processed after Hong Lanyou read them out, either by voting to amend them or by maintaining the original plan without objection. Of all the meetings that the National Assembly has held, there has never been one as smooth as the fourth meeting on the 9th.

The Assembly opened on March 29th and has held more than ten meetings so far, but it has only just finished processing the issues related to the meeting procedures. People are somewhat tired. At the end of the afternoon meeting on the 9th, only 1,146 delegates were present.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] The afternoon Assembly proceeded smoothly, but the procedures on the podium were slightly chaotic. The number of seats in the gallery of the Assembly is limited, and applicants have to be strictly restricted. Three delegates can only introduce one person to the gallery. When delegates are asked to sign, seven out of ten people tell them: "Old brother, you are one step late, I just signed once." Someone asked a certain delegate why he had no high opinions. He sighed and said: "Who still has the courage to speak, even Professor Zhou Gengsheng was booed down."

### Agenda of the First National Assembly: Starting Today, the General Assembly Will Review National Affairs; Presidents and Vice Presidents to be Elected on the 15th and 17th

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The agenda of the first National Assembly will be submitted for discussion at the fifth General Assembly on the 10th. The Presidium of the General Assembly has made this decision. The agenda includes four parts: (1) Reviewing national affairs, (2) Reviewing proposals, (3) Discussing proposals, (4) Electing the President and Vice President. The Presidium met at 8 p.m. on the evening of the 9th, chaired by Zhou Zhongyue, and planned to hold a General Assembly on the 10th, 12th, and 13th for three days to review national affairs. The 11th will be a rest day. Xue Dubi and Bai Chongxi have been nominated to serve as the chairpersons of the General Assembly on the morning and afternoon of the 10th. Regarding the election of the President and Vice President, the draft proposed by the Secretariat is: The President will be elected on the 15th, and the Vice President will be elected on the 17th. The names of the candidates will be announced three days in advance. The Presidium did not make a specific decision during the meeting. The original plan was to have one nomination form for each unit for the nomination of the Vice President. In order to avoid abuses, the Presidium decided to use individuals as units, and each delegate will be issued one nomination form for the Vice President for free nomination.

### The Rules of Procedure of the National Assembly have been Discussed and Completed

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The fourth General Assembly of the National Assembly was held at 3:40 p.m. on the 9th. The sixth group of the Presidium was on duty, chaired by Gan Naiguang. The draft rules of procedure of the General Assembly and the draft organizational regulations of the proposal review committee were continued to be discussed. Everything was calm and smooth, and all of them were successfully amended and passed. There were fewer speakers than in previous meetings.

### The Ministry of Economic Affairs Approves the New Price of Coal

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The new price of coal has been approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and will be changed from April. The new prices are as follows: (1) The price of East China coal delivered to Pukou in March was 4.04 million yuan per ton, and it will increase by 33% in April, to 5.37 million yuan per ton. (2) The price of Huainan coal delivered to Pukou was 3.21 million yuan, and it will increase by 33% from April, to 4.27 million yuan. (3) The price of Kai coal delivered on board a ship at Qinhuangdao in March was 3.04 million yuan. After the adjustment in April, it will be the same price as Huainan coal (4.27 million yuan), an increase of about 4.5%. (4) The Taiwan Coal Fuel Control Committee will submit a separate report.

### Wang Lingji Takes Office

### The National Army North of Shenyang Reaches Zhonggu: Sun Du Has Returned to Defend, the Battle of Western Liaoning Can Be Launched

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 9th] The national army sweeping force that went north from Shenyang reached Zhonggu Station on the 8th and defeated a large group of bandit troops entrenched in the area. The national army is continuing to advance forward.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 9th] A certain army commander Sun Du has returned to defend. It is said that Commander-in-Chief Wei has given instructions to open up the land traffic to Shenyang, and the battle of western Liaoning can be launched.

### Large Numbers of Troops Gather Outside of Zhengzhou: The Main Force of the Communist Bandits Fleeing East Has Crossed the Heishi Pass and Reached Fanshui; National Army in Southern Henan Pursues and Suppresses Remnant Bandits on Three Routes

[Our Zhengzhou Dispatch, 9th] The headquarters here announced: The national army has concentrated outside Zhengzhou and is determined to fight the invading bandits to the death. The national army's search troops are still active between Yiyang and Fanshui. In the southeast and west of Xinzheng, the bandits are retreating. Our air force is repeatedly bombing the bandits concentrated in Gongxian and retreating in the southeast and southwest of Xinzheng. Martial law in Zhengzhou has been extended from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. the next morning. Dehua Street, the downtown area, was under martial law for a time on the morning of the 9th, and non-essential personnel were not allowed to pass in the afternoon.

[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 9th] The main force of the 4th and 9th columns of the bandits who attempted to attack Zhengzhou has crossed the Heishi Pass and fled east. The vanguard troops had fled to Fanshui by the 8th. The 3rd column fled northeast from Mixian. Bandit traces have been found near Xingyang.

[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 9th] The elite army that entered Xiangcheng recently adopted fatigue pursuit. The 29th Division of Chen's 10th column has been mostly annihilated near Xinxingji, south of Xiangcheng. A remnant of the bandits fled northwest. The national army's powerful pursuit troops were divided into three routes to pursue and suppress, and have now reached the line of Jinqiao, Langwan, and Caifangji.

[Another Dispatch] More than 20,000 bandits who fled northwest from Fuyang to Runan and Zhumadian were pursued and suppressed by powerful units of the national army, and have now fled west of the Pinghan Railway. A part of the bandits who attempted to flee to Queshan were fiercely intercepted by the national army and have fled northwest. The railway bridges between Queshan and Zhumadian have all been destroyed by the bandits.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch, 9th] Liu's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 11th columns, and Chen's various columns, fled to the area west of Xiangcheng and Shangshui on the 8th. Another group of bandits fled to Runan and Suiping on the 8th. The national army continued to advance and attack the bandits.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 9th] After the national army inflicted heavy damage on the bandits in Linquan and Xiangcheng, a part of Liu's and Chen's bandits fled to Runan County, and a group fled southwest into Zhumadian. According to a certain senior commander here, the national army is enticing the bandits to go deeper, hoping to annihilate them in one fell swoop. It is also learned that the employees of the Pinghan Railway in Zhumadian have safely withdrawn to the south. The air force dispatched in batches on the 9th to search in southern Henan, and attacked the marching bandit army on the highway east of Runan and west of Zhumadian, killing more than 100 bandits.

[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 9th] The bandits who fled and occupied Baihe are now under the strict surveillance of the national army and cannot escape. There is no major change in northern Shaanxi. There was contact near the northeast of Luochuan on the 7th.

### The Annihilation of a Bandit Regiment Southwest of Zhangjiakou, and the Recovery of Helin and Liangcheng South of Suiyuan

[Our Correspondent in Gui Sui on the 9th] The two county towns of Helin and Liangcheng were recovered by the National Army on the 8th. Tianjiazhen in Liangcheng was also recovered on the 9th. The main force of the communist bandits, numbering over 20,000, has retreated towards Zuo Yun. Thus, the bandits' attempt to attack Gui Sui has been completely thwarted.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping on the 9th] On the line from Xibao to Huai'an, southwest of Zhangjiakou, the advance troops of the communist bandits, one column, approximately two brigades, have made major contact with the National Army. One of their regiments has been 80% annihilated, and another battalion has been completely annihilated. Their follow-up Second Column has yet to make contact.

[Our Correspondent in Taiyuan on the 9th] The fierce battle in Linfen has lasted over a month. The bandits' artillery fire and casualties have exceeded those of the Datong battle two years ago. The focus is on the city and the northeast corner of Dongguan. The bandits are making every effort to provide cover, building counter-embankments against the National Army's outer trenches, attempting to open a road to scale the city walls. The struggle for the outer trenches is fierce. Wang Zhen led two brigades from Hancheng across the river to reinforce. All sectors in Linfen are enthusiastically participating in the war. More than 300 cadres, students, police, and constables, along with all the employees of the power plant, have volunteered for service and have joined the ranks. On the 6th, the power plant captured more than a dozen female bandits.

### Editorial: Do Not Fail the Expectations of the People and the Government

-- Following President Chiang's Speech

The National Assembly held its fourth session yesterday. President Chiang himself attended the assembly to give a post-policy report. Although he frankly admitted the seriousness of the current situation, his analysis of the internal economic situation and the military situation indicated not only a solid economic foundation but also an optimistic outlook for the suppression of the rebellion. These frank and honest words can have a tremendous stabilizing effect on the morale within the country. They can eliminate the general public's panic over the economy and their defeatism regarding the military suppression of the rebellion. The communist bandits' various propaganda offensives regarding the economy and military affairs in recent years can thus be defeated without a fight.

We have read President Chiang's speech again and again. Its main points are as follows: (1) Pointing out the tasks of this National Assembly: first, to implement the constitution, so that Chinese politics can steadily step onto the right track of democratic constitutionalism; and second, to eliminate the obstacles to the implementation of the constitution and achieve the task of national construction. (2) Explaining that the current economic foundation is absolutely solid, and using the amount of legal tender issued, the national reserves, and all the materials to prove that the value of legal tender in relation to prices is far below its actual value today. Therefore, the current economic crisis lies in the people's uneasiness about legal tender caused by the communist bandits. (3) Analyzing the current military suppression of the bandits with a firm and sincere tone, expressing confidence that final victory will be achieved. In short, in the Northeast, as long as Shenyang, Changchun, and Jinzhou are in the hands of the National Army, it can be guaranteed that the Northeast will always be ours; the military situation in North China has gradually improved since General Fu Zuoyi took charge; in the Central China war, since Minister Bai went to suppress the bandits in person, the communist bandits have scattered eastward in all directions and have become mere roving bandits, and the communist bandits south of the Yellow River can be eliminated in the short term. (4) Urging the National Assembly representatives to complete the tasks entrusted to them by the National Assembly with extraordinary sincerity, and not to act capriciously and make a laughingstock of themselves, creating propaganda material for the communist bandits.

President Chiang's speech was full of enthusiasm and sincerity. Not to mention the National Assembly representatives present, who were deeply moved, even we ordinary people who read President Chiang's speech in the newspaper felt great comfort and believed that the uneasiness in the past was nothing more than "fussing over nothing." As long as the whole country, both the government and the people, can, under the leadership of the enlightened leader, take the same steps towards a peaceful, democratic, unified, and strong path, we will surely be able to fulfill our historical mission. The convening of this National Assembly is precisely to implement the constitution, and in accordance with the provisions of the constitution, to elect the president and vice president, so as to take the first step in leading our country's politics towards democratic constitutionalism. The people's hope for this National Assembly lies in completing this major task. The National Assembly representatives from all over the country have been entrusted by the people to go to the capital to attend this National Assembly meeting, and the mission they want to accomplish lies in this. Therefore, this National Assembly is "only allowed to succeed, not allowed to fail." It is truly a major key to our country's democratic constitutionalism. Whether it is bright or dark will depend on the outcome of this meeting.

However, this National Assembly has been in session for two weeks since it opened on March 29. Looking at the situation of the National Assembly meeting, the order in the venue does not seem to be very good. Sometimes representatives rush to speak or pound the table and shout abuse; other times representatives hiss and ridicule, or applaud for no reason, so that the meeting procedures cannot proceed. For the first six or seven days, in order to elect the presidium, it remained in the "preparatory meeting" stage for several days; and when the formal meeting was held, it almost caused an uproar because of the discussion of the rules of procedure. Although these phenomena are unavoidable in the parliaments of democratic countries, it is not a good way to quarrel and make trouble every day so that the meeting cannot proceed according to the scheduled date. Moreover, gathering two or three thousand representatives in the capital costs the government as much as 7 billion yuan a day, which is a waste of manpower and money. Some newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai have already made subtle criticisms of this situation of the National Assembly. President Chiang's speech also earnestly advised the representatives not to make a laughingstock of themselves, causing those who hate us to rejoice and creating propaganda material for the communist bandits. We also sincerely hope that the National Assembly representatives will deeply reflect, recognize the mission entrusted to them, quickly concentrate their will, and complete the tasks of this National Assembly as scheduled, so as not to fail the expectations of the voters. There are still two problems facing the National Assembly at present. We would like to say a word to the National Assembly representatives on these two matters.

The first is the issue of amending the constitution. According to Articles 27 and 174 of the constitution, this National Assembly can amend the constitution, but no legal or political system is absolutely superior or inferior. Our constitution has not yet been implemented, and there are no facts to prove that it needs to be amended. Moreover, the constitution should have stability and should not be easily amended. This is a generally recognized principle by constitutional scholars. Recalling the debate on the draft constitution at the National Assembly in December two years ago, it took countless efforts to pass this relatively democratic and progressive draft constitution, which became the current "Constitution of the Republic of China that is being implemented." If it is significantly amended without being implemented, then the constitution-making work of the previous year would have been in vain. Furthermore, in terms of the current political environment, the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and the general non-party members have all expressed their opposition to this National Assembly amending the constitution. If the opinions of the minority parties are not respected, it will inevitably cause new disputes. Therefore, although we acknowledge that the National Assembly has the power to amend the constitution, we do not regard the constitutional provisions as sacred and inviolable; but we oppose this National Assembly making significant amendments to the constitution. If you want to expand the powers of the National Assembly or restore the provisions of the May 5th Draft Constitution, we believe that these are all inappropriate.

The second is the issue of the National Assembly reviewing national affairs. The rules of procedure passed the day before yesterday have added a clause: "When the National Assembly is in session, it may listen to the government's policy reports, review national affairs, and make inquiries and suggestions." On the surface, this clause seems to contradict Article 27 of the constitution; but in fact it is not so. Because the National Assembly is an organ that exercises political power and may exercise the power of initiative, only because Article 27 has a "proviso" that the National Assembly cannot exercise the power of initiative before half of the counties and cities in the country have exercised the power of initiative and referendum. However, we see that democratic countries in Europe and the United States that adopt a bicameral system, whether it is the Senate or the House of Representatives, have the right to listen to government policy reports and ask questions of the government. In addition, this National Assembly is being held at a time when the situation is most serious, and it is even more necessary to discuss national affairs. However, discussing national affairs does not necessarily have to be done in the assembly; it can also be done outside the assembly. In any case, it is a nature of exchanging opinions, you can ask the government questions, and you can also provide the government with suggestions, but you cannot pass any resolutions, and even if there are resolutions, they do not have the power to bind the government, but can only be provided to the authorities for reference.

The above explanation is entirely based on legal principles. If the representatives can remain calm and respect legal principles, then this National Assembly can proceed smoothly and complete its important tasks as scheduled, without failing the expectations of the people and the government.

### President's Report to the National Assembly: Elimination of Bandit Troops Does Not Diminish National Army Strength; Bandit Casualties Exceed National Army Threefold

Since the start of the bandit suppression war, the National Army has indeed lost seventeen divisions. This includes some poorly trained provisional troops, as well as troops that have been fighting for many years. Due to the negligence and incompetence of a few generals, or poor management, and failure to maintain secrecy, these troops have failed. The loss of these troops is tantamount to self-elimination, and can be said to have caused no loss to the overall strength of the National Army. Now, the truly well-trained National Army is not only not weakened, but is becoming stronger day by day. As for the losses of the National Army, they are about 10% of the total, and 80% of the replenishment has been completed in the past few months. Everyone should not only listen to the propaganda of the bandits, only see the 10% of the troops that have been lost, and not see the 90% of the sound and strong troops. In fact, since the bandit suppression operations, although the National Army has suffered losses, the losses of the bandit army have been several times greater than those of the National Army. Here I can cite detailed figures for comparison. In 1946, the number of casualties in the National Army was more than 210,000, and the number of casualties in the bandit army was more than 520,000. The number of National Army soldiers captured was 23,000, and the number of bandit army soldiers captured was 54,000. In 1947, the number of casualties in the National Army was more than 410,000, and the number of casualties in the bandit army was more than 1,600,000. The number of National Army soldiers captured was 120,000, and the number of bandit army soldiers captured was 116,000. In total, the number of bandit army soldiers killed, wounded, and captured exceeds the National Army by more than three times. Everyone must not only look at the propaganda of the bandits, and ignore the fact that the National Army's heavy sacrifices have already obtained a price more than three times greater. In particular, the loyalty and martyrdom of our senior generals, who fought to the last man, and then died heroically by committing suicide. For example, Liu Kan, commander of the 29th Army, Lu Ying, commander of the 35th Army, Dai Ziqi, commander of the 69th Division, and Zhang Lingfu, commander of the 74th Division, fully demonstrated the spirit of our National Revolutionary Army of not yielding in the face of danger and sacrificing oneself for righteousness, and showed the long-standing and lofty spiritual strength of our nation. The stories of these martyrs are all worthy of praise and tears. There are indeed facts of poor military discipline and corruption in our National Army, but everyone should not indiscriminately lump everything together. Just because one officer or soldier is like this, misunderstand that all the officers and soldiers are like this. You must know that we have so many troops, and since the 20th year of the Republic of China, we have been suppressing bandits, and after eight years of resistance against Japan, we have continued to suppress bandits. With such a long and protracted war, it is of course not easy to make all the troops disciplined. I can say that today, the vast majority of the National Army generals are law-abiding, do not hesitate to sacrifice, and can be persevering, using the few to defeat the many. No matter how much the bandit army brags about its achievements and slanders the National Army, in fact, in addition to the troops that have been eliminated and lost, there are still many troops standing firm, holding their positions, and actively looking for bandits to fight.

Everyone Must Not Neglect the Communist Bandits' Conspiracy to Stir Up Discord

One more point that everyone must not neglect is that the communist bandits' consistent conspiracy is to try to stir up discord and divide our National Army. They falsely claim that some of our troops are central army troops, and some are local army troops. They have never discovered the strength of their so-called local army troops. However, in this bandit suppression operation, these troops have all demonstrated a full fighting spirit. They are neither able to be stirred up or shaken by the communist bandits, nor are they something that the communist bandits' despicable mentality could have anticipated. For example, the troops in Chahar and Suiyuan, everyone knows, are the most brave and good at fighting, and deeply supported by the people. The Shanxi army stubbornly defended Linfen, resisting more than three times their number of enemies for more than ten days, standing firm and unyielding. And the Guangdong troops fighting in the Yangtze River area, the Hunan troops in the Northeast, the Guangxi troops in the Dabie Mountains, and the Sichuan troops in Central China are all full of fighting spirit and vigorous in spirit. As for the Ningxia troops in Shaanxi and the Qinghai troops in eastern Gansu, they can all maintain their historical glory and give full play to their bandit suppression specialties, creating good results. This is enough to prove that after eight years of resistance against Japan, all the troops in China have been influenced by the national spirit, sharing life and death as one, united as one, and there is no longer any regional distinction to speak of. It can be said that today, not only all the officers and soldiers in the country swear not to coexist with the communist bandits, but all the people in the country are also united against the enemy, identifying this gang of bandits who betray the nation as the only enemy that must be suppressed. We use national righteousness to deal with national traitors, and national unity to deal with class dictatorship. Where right and wrong lie is where success and failure are judged. Now, the number and designation of communist bandits in the customs have indeed increased. To achieve final victory in the future, it is natural that we must go through arduous struggles. However, the expansion of the communist bandits' forces is only coercing strong men from the bandit areas to fight without training. If we can work hard according to a consistent strategy, I, based on my experience of commanding troops in combat for more than 20 years, and observing the actual military situation, am indeed very optimistic about the bandit suppression military affairs. As long as our compatriots across the country are not shaken by the communist bandits' propaganda, recognize the truth, strengthen their confidence, strengthen military-civilian cooperation, and improve self-defense organizations, then there is no doubt that we will achieve final victory. After you have heard my report, you will know that the foundation of the country is absolutely secure, and there is no need to be afraid.

Hope Representatives Fulfill the Responsibilities Entrusted by the People

Finally, I want to explain my hope for the Assembly. The most important task for you representatives to participate in the Assembly is to implement the Constitution, establish the scale and system of constitutional government, and at the same time, we have a more urgent task, which is to save the people and relieve the people's current greatest pain. I, Chiang Kai-shek, am the Chairman of the National Government, but I am also a member of the people. Today, I am pleading on behalf of the people, asking you representatives to work together to focus your spirit and eyes, face our people's common enemy, the communist bandits, and contribute all our intelligence and wisdom to lay the foundation for the country, quell the civil strife, and save our compatriots who are in dire straits. Therefore, this National Assembly is a National Assembly for implementing the Constitution, and it is also a National Assembly for saving the country and the people. You representatives must know that the communist bandits are the most insidious and vicious bandits and brigands in Chinese history, and are unprecedented rebels of the country. Today, we can only carry forward our revolutionary spirit and national integrity to quell the disasters and save the crisis. The current struggle is indeed more difficult than the war of resistance against Japan. However, this is a war between good and evil, right and wrong. Everything the communist bandits are doing today is destroying ethics, obliterating humanity, and violating the spirit of our Chinese nation. Even if they are rampant for a while, they will eventually fail completely. You representatives must be mindful of the precarious situation of the country today, and you must know that since the convocation of our National Assembly, the communist bandits have been plotting to sabotage us all the time, hoping that we will fail. Every word and deed in the Assembly must be done with great caution, and we must not give the communist bandits an excuse to slander and ridicule us. You representatives must, on the one hand, recognize your own position and powers, and fulfill the responsibilities entrusted to you by the people of the whole country, and at the same time, you must recognize that the current situation is a very extraordinary period, and it is not a time to discuss principles leisurely. Therefore, when we deal with all the problems, we must adhere to the spirit of the extraordinary period, which must be simple and quick in order to buy time and save the country. This Assembly brings together 3,000 representatives from all over the country, which is not only an unprecedented event in Chinese history, but also a key to the rise and fall of the country in the future. Now, the whole world is watching to see the outcome of this Assembly. The success of the Assembly is the success of the entire country. Therefore, when we deal with any problems during the Assembly, we must concentrate our will, be concise and avoid complexity, so that the meeting can proceed smoothly, and we must not focus on details, argue endlessly, and fail to make a decision. The Song people said, "If the discussion is not settled, the soldiers have already crossed the river." It can be seen that a lack of unity of will is enough to delay national affairs. Therefore, I believe that the simpler the procedures for the country, the better, and the faster the progress of the agenda, the better. This is what I want to offer to the Assembly.

The above is the general political report I made to the Assembly on behalf of the government for your representatives to review, and I hope you will not hesitate to give your advice. (End of full text)

### US Pushes West German Plan - Suggests Establishing West German Government Early - Three Powers Negotiate Matters of Occupied Zone Merger

[Reuters, London, 8th] Reliable source: The United States has suggested establishing a West German government in one year, divided into five stages. Experts from six countries, including Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium, will discuss the German issue in Berlin starting on the 8th, with this as the main theme. The five stages specified in the plan are: (1) Organize a temporary government including the current British-American merged zone and the French zone; (2) Adjust the boundaries between the states; (3) Elect a constitutional parliament; (4) The parliament drafts a constitution; (5) Establish a formal new German government. This US plan was drawn up based on recent developments in Berlin and can be regarded as the latest formal attitude of Washington and the US occupation authorities in Germany. People here believe that France, before the meeting, did not intend to change its previously announced position, that is, before first resolving the two issues related to French security, namely the future political structure of Germany and the international control of the Ruhr, it could not reach a decision on merging the French zone with the British-American zone. Reliable sources said that the British representative participating in the six-nation talks in Berlin has given broad support to the American initiative to revise the timetable for merging the three zones. Observers also believe that in view of the recent crisis in Berlin, the United States needs to step up the political and economic organization of West Germany as part of the overall plan for the recovery of Western Europe. In addition, the United States believes that if steps are not taken to establish a West German temporary government, it will inevitably face the established facts of the Eastern country and government. Therefore, the United States has decided to accelerate the promotion of its plan for West Germany.

[Reuters, Paris, 8th] The US plan to establish a West German government within one year has aroused suspicion among French officials. They believe that if the US plan is as rumored by the outside world, the election of the West German constitutional assembly is likely to cause the most feared central government in France. The French representative, Mauville, who participated in the six-nation expert negotiations, is expected to firmly oppose the establishment of a West German central government and will insist on maintaining a federal-based government that allows the states to retain strong powers. France also believes that the government set up in Frankfurt is not as appealing as the government set up in Berlin. Mauville will represent the French government in asking Britain and the United States not to fall into the trap of the Soviet Union and give the Soviet Union an excuse to establish a German government in Berlin.

[Reuters, Washington, 8th] President Truman today declined to comment on reports that the United States has proposed a five-point plan to establish a West German government within one year.

[Reuters, London, 8th] A Foreign Office spokesman said that representatives from Britain, the United States, and France will meet in London in the second half of this month to resume discussions on the issue of organizing West Germany on a self-sufficient basis. The British Cabinet met today to discuss the German issue. It can be asserted that Britain does not intend to make any concessions on its policy towards Germany.

[Reuters, London, 8th] A British Foreign Office spokesman recently solemnly denied the French report that Foreign Secretary Bevin will go to Berlin next week to announce the establishment of West Germany. The London report issued by the French said that if the Soviet Union continues to resist the Allied Control Council, the West German government will be announced.

### Britain Dissatisfied with Soviet Military Commander's Reply - Considering Fighter Escorts - US and France Will Take Similar Steps

[Associated Press, Berlin, 8th] After the British military authorities received a reply from Soviet Military Commander Sokolovsky refusing to provide written guarantees not to interfere with the air corridor, Britain and the United States were tonight reconsidering plans to send fighter planes to protect transport planes flying to Berlin. France is expected to take similar steps.

[Reuters, Berlin, 9th] A British Air Force spokesman said that he was unaware of the TASS report that Britain and the Soviet Union had appointed a joint commission to jointly investigate the incident of British and Soviet planes colliding. The British Air Force has not received any such instructions. According to officials in charge of the Allied aviation authorities, the Soviet TASS statement is neither new nor important, but it may indicate that the Soviet Union will begin to demand changes in aviation rules. For more than a year, the Allies have repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with Soviet planes flying into Allied airfields and other violations of regulations, and the Soviet Union has also expressed dissatisfaction with Britain and the United States. This mutual accusation has become a cliché.

### Allied Control Council for Germany - Regular Meeting Not Held

Soviet Union Approves Establishment of East German Economic Committee

[Associated Press, Berlin, 9th] US Military Commander for Germany Clay announced today that tomorrow is the day for the Allied Control Council to hold its regular meeting, but since no country has requested a meeting, there will be no meeting at that time. Clay is the rotating chairman of the committee for April. This statement shows that since the Soviet Union recently attempted to force the Western countries to withdraw from Berlin, the hope for four-power cooperation has become increasingly dim. At the same time, it was learned today that the Soviet military authorities have finally approved the establishment of a communist-controlled economic committee in the East German occupation zone.

### Soviet Sentries Fire Shots into the Sky at Border of US and Soviet Occupation Zones

### Allied Commanders in Berlin - Command Meeting - Britain Refutes Soviet Accusations

Six-Group Meeting Approved to Be Abolished

[Reuters, Berlin, 8th] The Berlin Four-Power Joint Command continued to meet today after the Western powers agreed to the Soviet request to abolish the six-nation committee under the command. The Soviet Union originally requested the abolition of eight committees, integrating their tasks into other committees. The Soviet Union requested the dissolution of eight committees, including construction and housing, transportation, economy, social affairs, fuel, property control, de-Nazification, and culture. After concessions from the Western powers, the four powers agreed to retain the economic committee, handed over the issue of the existence of the property control committee to the four-power commanders for handling, and abolished the remaining six committees. During the meeting of the Four-Power Joint Command, British representative Brigadier General Benson accused the Soviet authorities of restricting passenger and freight transport in an attempt to suffocate Berlin. He also reiterated his denial of the Soviet representative Yeliseyev's accusation on April 2 that the Western three powers "looted Berlin," pointing out that the Soviet side wanted to use this as an excuse to implement traffic control.

### Civil Administration of Trieste - Will Be Transferred to Italians

[Reuters, Rome, 8th] It was formally announced here: the non-military administrative organs in the British-American zone of the Free Territory of Trieste are scheduled to be handed over at 9:00 AM local time on April 12. At that time, the British and American flags will be taken down, and most positions will be transferred to Italians in the zone. A new administrative organ will be established, with US General Gates serving as the liaison between the military and administrative authorities in the zone. According to authoritative sources in London, all duties of the municipal government departments, except those related to public safety and order, will be handed over to local representatives. Since elections cannot be held under the current provisional regime, these representatives will be appointed by the Allied military government, and the candidates will be responsible and prestigious people in the local area. Apart from the Communist Party, Slovenians and Italians can be elected. It is generally believed that this move by the Allies is the first practical step towards realizing the return of the Free Territory of Trieste to Italy.

### US Will Give Strong Support to Western European Five-Nation Alliance - Only the Way to Take It Is Still to Be Finally Determined

[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] The planned Western European alliance seems to be able to obtain strong military assistance from the United States to enhance the strength of Western countries to resist Soviet expansion. However, according to official Washington opinion, there are still several major issues to be resolved, and the exact form of this assistance is one of them. Belgian Prime Minister Spaak met with President Truman, Undersecretary of State Lovett, and other US leaders here this week. According to what Spaak told reporters, European countries will later ask the United States for assistance in military and reconstruction aspects. However, the new organization is still in its initial stage, and countries should first consolidate it. State Department and Defense Department officials have studied what form US assistance should take. There are two possibilities. One is that the United States will arm its army with assistance to Western European countries in need of guns, ammunition, airplanes, tanks, etc. The other is to directly conclude a military alliance with the Western European alliance.

### American Lend-Lease Materials - Supplied the Soviet Union During the War

Totaling More Than 10 Billion US Dollars

[French News Agency, Washington, 8th] A State Department spokesman declared: US-Soviet negotiations to clear the Soviet Union's $10.6 billion debt under the Lend-Lease Act have made some progress. Agreement has been reached on the main issues, but many issues remain to be resolved. The State Department will publish the original text of the four agreements to aid the Soviet Union, in order to respond to the accusation by Quinn, chairman of the House Surplus Property Committee, that the United States continued to ship military supplies to the Soviet Union after the end of the war in accordance with the secret agreement signed by Roosevelt.

[US News Service, Washington, 8th] The State Department tonight released the content of four wartime draft treaties, according to which the United States, at the request of the Soviet Union, supplied the Soviet Union with millions of tons of non-military materials in addition to purely military equipment in order to carry out the war against Nazi Germany. The materials supplied by the United States under the Lend-Lease program totaled $10.774 billion. The preamble of the document pointed out that the Soviet Union only purchased 2% of the wartime materials with cash. The Lend-Lease figures show that, in addition to purely military materials, the largest shipment to the Soviet Union was nearly 4.5 million short tons of 50 different kinds of food. Among all the materials, the value of industrial machinery and equipment was more than $1 billion. The United States shipped 2.8 million short tons of steel, 802,000 tons of non-ferrous metals, 2.6 million tons of coal products, more than 106 million yards of cotton cloth, more than 3 million tires and inner tubes, and more than 15 million pairs of boots to the Soviet Union.

### Strachey Reduces Report on Japanese Reparations - Ashida Expresses Dissatisfaction - Hopes that the Issue of Islands and Fishing Rights Will Be Resolved by the Peace Conference

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] Japanese Prime Minister Ashida Hitoshi told a reporter from the Central News Agency today that Japan currently has many issues waiting to be resolved at the peace conference. One of the most important issues is the issue of the attribution of small islands near Japan. A few days ago, an American reporter said: It is indeed not the case that we recognize the globe as an inseparable part of Japan. What he was referring to were the small islands east of Hokkaido occupied by the Soviet Union after Japan's surrender. Whether in terms of geography, law, or history, each island does not belong to the Kuril Islands, which were assigned to the Soviet Union according to the Allied agreement before the end of the war.

In addition, the issue of fishing rights also needs to be resolved at the peace conference. At present, the scope of activity of Japanese fishing boats is very small, and they can only reach a small number of areas in the Bering Sea, the South Pacific, and the Chinese coast. However, because the Japanese people rely on the sea for food, they hope that the fishing area can be expanded. In addition, Strachey's report apparently did not change the situation of reparations. Before this issue is resolved, Japanese industry cannot have any plans. Regarding the possibility of the United States individually allowing Japanese to enter the country, Ashida said: Those who are allowed to enter the United States are a small number of Japanese who are engaged in intermediary work for American consumers and manufacturers of Japanese export goods. Before the peace treaty is signed, Japan cannot freely conduct foreign trade.

### Australian Foreign Minister Opposes - Rebuilding Japanese Military

MacArthur Orders Japan to Supply List of Materials

[United Press, Canberra, 8th] Australian Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Evatt told the House of Representatives today: "It would be unfortunate for Australia if Japan were given the opportunity to rearm." Evatt called for the implementation of the general principles of the Potsdam Declaration, but agreed that Japan could become "the factory of Asia" to some extent. "We must prevent Japan from becoming an aggressor again. We must maintain the living standards of Japan, but they should not be higher than those of the countries that have been attacked and damaged by Japan."

[United Press, Tokyo, 9th] An Allied Headquarters spokesman told the Japanese on the 9th that the US government is planning to spend money to supply Japan with raw materials to stabilize its economy. He asked the Japanese to complete the list of its important materials, which was ordered by MacArthur. Rosenford of the Allied Headquarters Economic and Scientific Group warned that most Japanese individuals, government agencies, and business firms must be subject to the Allied Headquarters order to submit a list of important materials, and must submit the list before the 10th.

### U.S. Loan Plan for Latin America Receives Lukewarm Response at Pan-American Conference; U.S. Intention Is to Counter Argentina's Proposal

[United Press International, Bogotá, 8th] The United States encountered its most indifferent setback in the history of the Pan-American Conference on the 8th. When the United States read President Truman's message at the Pan-American Conference requesting Congress to lend another $500 million from the Export-Import Bank to South America, the delegations from more than 20 American countries attending the conference sat and listened in silence. The U.S. delegation was extremely embarrassed and angry.

Marshall had scheduled the reading of this message at the final meeting of the plenary session on the 8th, expecting the news to elicit enthusiasm. However, contrary to expectations, the entire auditorium remained silent from beginning to end during the reading of Truman's request, and remained so afterwards. U.S. representatives admitted that their "enticement" had failed. Their anger could not be dispelled, as they believed that Latin America had no sense of gratitude. The reading of Truman's message was intended to counter Argentina's leadership on economic issues and its proposal for a new Pan-American bank.

[Associated Press, Bogotá, Colombia, 8th] The U.S. delegation today proposed a thorough review of the economic plans currently under discussion at the Pan-American Conference, urging other American countries to reduce tariffs and eliminate international trade restrictions to promote global economic prosperity.

### Drafting Committee on Freedom of Information Passes Resolution to Resist Distorted News; Eastern and Western Nations in Harmony on This Issue

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 8th, United Press International] The drafting committee of the International Conference on Freedom of Information passed a resolution stipulating resistance to inflammatory and distorted news. Prior to this, the U.S. representative had opposed a motion to prohibit journalists from attending hearings. The acting chairman of the committee, U.S. representative Mr. Conant, expressed that closed meetings were inconsistent with the purpose of the Conference on Freedom of Information. Thereupon, all representatives on the committee unanimously passed a motion to make the conference open. The proposal, supported by the United States and seven other Western countries, calling for immediate action both internationally and domestically within member states to resist distorted news, was revised by representatives from both Eastern and Western nations and unanimously passed by the ten-nation drafting committee. This is perhaps the most unifying resolution since the conference began three weeks ago.

[Agence France-Presse, Geneva, 8th] The third committee of the Freedom of Information Conference unanimously passed a proposal today condemning any racial discrimination against journalists that hinders their news gathering. The proposal guarantees foreign journalists the right to freely gather news.

### Phibun Ordered to Form New Siamese Cabinet; Cabinet Members of Aphaiwong Will Not Participate

[Reuters, Bangkok, 9th] It is reported that the Siamese Regency Council summoned Marshal Phibun Songkhram, the leader of last year's coup, to the palace on the afternoon of the 8th and authorized him to form a new government. The new cabinet is expected to be an expanded coalition cabinet that includes all parties.

[Associated Press, Bangkok, 8th] Siamese Prime Minister Khuang Aphaiwong has resigned under pressure from the military. The Regency Council today ordered Phibun to form a new cabinet. Phibun has served as Commander-in-Chief of the Defense Forces since the coup last November. All cabinet members of Aphaiwong's cabinet unanimously agreed not to participate in the new cabinet.

[Associated Press, Bangkok, 9th] The Democratic Party voted last night to refuse to participate in the new cabinet led by Phibun, thus reducing the chances of Phibun successfully forming a coalition cabinet. According to informed sources, Phibun may invite former Prime Minister Pridi Banomyong, who is in exile in Singapore, to return to the country and cooperate.

### General Chennault on U.S. Policy Toward China

Copyrighted by the Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance Translated by This Newspaper's Translation Department

(14) Neglecting China's Internal Situation

The majority of U.S. wartime aid to China was used for operations around Burma, while the situation within China deteriorated to near catastrophe.

I do not have statistics at hand to show the distribution of U.S. efforts during the Burma campaign, but I estimate that approximately ninety percent of the total capacity of the China-Burma-India Theater was used in that direction.

From the beginning, General Stilwell and his theater command staff almost completely ignored the possibility and need to expand the Hump airlift, with the exception of matters related to the Burma campaign. The special attention paid to the Burma campaign can be seen in the fact that he diverted eight aviation engineer regiments, originally assigned to India to improve airfields to increase the airlift capacity over the Himalayas from Upper Burma, to build the Ledo Road.

Our strategy—that is, General Stilwell's strategy—limited the main effort within China to defensive actions, and by mid-1944, even defense was out of the question.

China not only failed to contribute offensively to the defeat of Japan but even came close to complete collapse in 1944, when the Japanese offensive captured eastern China and reduced the possibility of opening a Chinese port to coordinate with U.S. forces in the Pacific to an immeasurable degree.

The Burma campaign first restored a long, difficult, and questionably valuable truck route, and laid an oil pipeline to southwestern China, the latter being its most concrete and direct contribution. In addition, it moved the Hump route southward somewhat, avoiding the need to fly at such high altitudes as before.

If the Japanese army could not be cleared from Northern Burma through General Stilwell's operations, it might not have been possible to airlift more than 30,000 tons of cargo to China each month. But if there had been no Burma campaign, then our entire strength could have been used for China itself, instead of just a very small portion.

We would also not have lost eastern China on the eve of Japan's imminent defeat. Since this statement may seem like hindsight, I must add that this is what I thought at the time our strategy was being formulated. I even believe that even if we had put most of our strength into Burma, we could still have held eastern China.

The reason we lost eastern China was simply due to a slight deficiency in strength. If a few hundred tons of supplies could have been delivered to the right place at the right time, the situation could have been salvaged.

I can only offer two difficult explanations for Stilwell's design: either he thought it was worthwhile to exchange Burma for eastern China and its forward air bases, or he simply lacked the foresight to strengthen the interior of China while conducting the Northern Burma campaign.

Our simplest military objective was to support the central government, which had been holding back over a million Japanese troops since 1937, so that it could cooperate when the U.S. expeditionary force needed to land on the Asian mainland.

Before the Japanese launched their offensive in early 1944, the theater command had never had a sound assessment of the situation within China. Even after the offensive was launched, the warnings and suggestions repeatedly made by my command were consistently ignored or underestimated.

The cooperative relationship between the theater command and the China command was insufficient and tense. There was no concrete U.S. aid for the armies defending Free China, only support for a small-scale air force, the effectiveness of which was constantly hampered by other parties vying for Hump airlift supplies.

In February 1944, I warned General Stilwell that the Japanese seemed about to launch an air offensive. Enemy air activity was the first available sign of an impending offensive.

In mid-March, I requested supplies from the Hump to support attacks on enemy ships and to maintain the strength of the air bases in eastern China.

I repeatedly requested in mid-March and repeatedly warned in April, and in a more concrete manner, because the enemy's intentions to launch an offensive had become increasingly clear. But the best response General Stilwell gave to these advance warnings was that we should do our best with the means at hand—which, in reality, were woefully inadequate.

### New Prices for Water, Electricity, Gas, and Telephone Approved After Consultation, Effective Yesterday; Telephone Nearly Doubles, Ranging from 65,000 to 70,000 Yuan; Strong Reactions, Prices Rise Across the Board in the Afternoon

[Reported by this Newspaper] The new prices for water, electricity, gas, and telephone services for April in this city have been determined. Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao Huijue met yesterday morning with City Council representatives Jiang Hao, Wang Zhuyi, and Tang Chengzong (represented by Gao Shu'an). They adjusted the prices based on changes in the cost of living index and the prices of foreign exchange and coal, according to the automatic adjustment formula promulgated by the central government. The adjustments were approved by the city government. Water prices increased by 69%, electricity by 65%, gas by 70%, and telephone by 98.4%. The new prices took effect yesterday (the 9th). During the review meeting, Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao and the City Council representatives made every effort to lower the adjustment percentages requested by the various companies. The companies all argued that the increases in the cost of living index, foreign exchange, fuel (coal, diesel, etc.), and hardware were at least 40% and as high as over 100%. They felt that they could no longer afford to sustain losses. After four hours of debate during the meeting, Director Zhao and the City Council representatives repeatedly reduced the percentages, finally determining the new prices. Also, the excess usage fees for gas and the excess call counting rates for telephones were reduced during this review meeting. The excess usage fee for gas was previously calculated at twice the base price for both household and factory users, but now it has been changed to one and a half times the base price. The telephone counting rate was previously higher for calls exceeding 400 times, but now it will be charged the same rate as calls exceeding 200 times. In addition, because Dachang District has been officially incorporated into the city this month, the electricity rates of the Daya Electric Company in that district have also been reviewed and approved. However, all sectors of the city were surprised upon learning of the new prices, unanimously believing that the increases were too large and unexpected. The market in the city was still stable yesterday morning, but in the afternoon, stimulated by this news, prices rose across the board, eliciting a strong reaction. Citizens are feeling the direct and indirect impact of these price hikes and are finding it difficult to bear the burden. The four adjusted prices are listed below:

Water (per cubic meter) (increased by 69%)

Inland, Zhabei, and Pudong Companies: 29,000 yuan

British and French Water Companies: 22,000 yuan

Electricity (per kilowatt-hour) (average increase of 65%) Lighting/Heating Power

Shanghai Power Company: 20,400 yuan 17,000 yuan

French Company: 23,200 yuan 19,000 yuan

Zhabei Water and Electricity Company: 26,500 yuan 22,300 yuan

Pudong Electric Company: 27,500 yuan 23,200 yuan

Huashang Electric Company: 29,500 yuan 24,600 yuan

Daya Electric Company: 34,450 yuan 29,000 yuan

Gas (increased by 70%)

Shanghai Gas Company and Wusong Gas Plant: 66,000 yuan per 100 cubic feet

Equivalent to 23,300 yuan per cubic meter

Telephone (per call) (average increase of 98.4%)

Under 200 calls: 9,000 yuan

Over 201 calls: 15,000 yuan

Public telephone: 20,000 yuan per call

Transportation Costs Set to Increase

The new prices for trams, buses, small trains, ferries, etc. for April will be implemented from the 15th of this month, after a review meeting is convened by the Public Utilities Bureau today. However, the amount of the increase still needs to be considered, so a decision may not be made today.

### Taxi Fares Increase by 55%; 20 Minutes Costs 280,000 Yuan

[Reported by this Newspaper] Taxi fares in this city will be adjusted starting tomorrow. The new price is 280,000 yuan per 20 minutes, an increase of 55% from the original price of 180,000 yuan.

### After Publication of Supplementary Regulations, News Agencies and Jewelry Stores Not Permitted

[Reported from Nanjing by This Newspaper, 9th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs approved a request from the Shanghai Municipal Government, submitted by the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that since the publication of the supplementary regulations to Article 4 of the Measures for the Administration of the Receipt and Manufacture of Jewelry by Jewelry Stores, coinciding with the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau's order for all money exchange businesses to cease operations, a few speculative merchants have taken the opportunity to open jewelry stores to engage in gold and silver speculation. To curb this practice, it is stipulated that all jewelry stores opened after the publication of the above-mentioned supplementary regulations will not be permitted. This matter was forwarded to the Ministry for review and instructions. After consultation with the Ministry of Finance, it was agreed to proceed accordingly, and a draft will be prepared and sent to the Ministry of Finance for signature and issuance.

[Reported by this Newspaper] According to Mayor Wu's report at yesterday's municipal meeting, the rice rationing work in this city for April has made even more progress than in March. All citizens who registered their household status before March 10 have received their rice coupons. There is no crowding at rice stores.

### Municipal Meeting Approves Trial Implementation of Purchasing Surplus Rice from Rice Markets; Must Have Actual Rice and Cannot Sell Short

[Reported by this Newspaper] The simplified rules for the Shanghai Municipal Government's purchase of surplus rice from the north and south rice markets were drafted by Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Ren Xianqun, Chairman of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, and submitted to yesterday's municipal meeting for discussion. It was decided to approve the trial implementation of the rules, the main points of which are as follows:

(1) All surplus rice in the north and south markets after free trading each morning may be applied for purchase from the Civil Affairs Committee by rice merchants before 2:00 PM that afternoon. The minimum application is 50 city piculs (each city picul is uniformly calculated at 156 city catties net weight), and there must be actual rice on hand; short selling is not allowed. The purchase price should not exceed the market price of free trading on that day (based on the market price list for that day). (2) In order to enrich the supply of civil food and avoid stimulating a sharp rise in rice prices, the Civil Affairs Committee may, after review by the review panel, decide whether to purchase the surplus rice applied for, or not to purchase it, or to purchase only a portion of it. (3) The Civil Affairs Committee may, at any time, entrust the market to sell and supply the surplus rice purchased in the preceding article according to the needs of the free market in order to regulate the market. (4) After the delivery order is reviewed and confirmed by the Civil Affairs Committee, the Civil Affairs Committee will pay 70% of the rice price first (a check for the second day), and the balance will be settled after all the rice has been inspected and accepted, with invoices and receipts. (5) After the rice is sold, the actual rice must be delivered within 24 hours. All inspection, weighing, warehousing, and storage are handled by warehouses designated by the Civil Affairs Committee entrusted by the national banks.

### Sakhalin Returnees Expelled from Taiwan

### Soldier Trafficker Jumps from Vehicle to Escape: Shot and Killed During Pursuit

The Songhu Garrison Headquarters issued a statement yesterday, saying: "Chuan Xiangfu, a soldier assigned to deliver documents by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, suddenly went missing on March 18th while carrying three official documents for delivery. An immediate search was launched, which found that the deserter had been enticed by Dai Yushan, a soldier trafficker from Taicang County. Considering the trafficker's audacity in inducing active-duty military personnel of national defense agencies and the gravity of the crime, Zhang Yuren, a section chief from the adjutant office, was dispatched to Taicang with adjutants to arrest Dai Yushan in conjunction with Magistrate Xue. Four checks totaling 84 million yuan were found on him at the time of the arrest. In his residence, three deceived and sold draftees, including He Rongshuang, were found confined indoors. However, the deserter Chuan Xiangfu had already been drafted into the army. Subsequently, Dai Yushan led the way to the Taicang Self-Defense Brigade to hand over Chuan. Dai was then escorted back for interrogation. It was revealed that Chuan Xiangfu's documents were also seized by Dai Yushan and handed over to Xu Xianfa (a native of Taicang). According to Dai's confession, he was willing to lead the recovery efforts. A platoon leader of the special task company, Wang Pinquan, was assigned to escort Dai to Taicang to retrieve the seized documents. However, the suspect, fearing punishment, jumped from the vehicle and escaped near Jinshi Road on the Shanghai-Taicang Highway. After a half-mile pursuit in the dark of night, the platoon leader fired a warning shot. The suspect continued to flee and was subsequently shot and killed. The incident was reported, and the headquarters sent personnel to the scene to inspect the body and arrange for burial. Considering the suspect's crimes, the original intention was to impose severe punishment. His attempt to escape and subsequent death are deemed well-deserved. The remaining suspects are currently under strict interrogation."

### Rental Dispute on Yanqing Road: Residents Vigorously Defend Their Right to Residence

Another serious housing rental dispute has recently occurred in this city.

Li Lansheng himself has gone to Hong Kong.

### Litigious Madman: Specializing in Making Judges Happy - Gao Jingmiaoqing Files Another Bizarre Lawsuit, Listing Thousands of Businesses as Defendants

[Our Newspaper's Report] Gao Jingqing, who is fond of litigation, previously filed a nonsensical lawsuit against Shen Junru of the China Democratic League and Senator Zhang Zhongyuan. Now, he has filed another lawsuit with the District Prosecutor's Office, accusing more than 2,900 companies, including Yiyuan Transportation Company. After reviewing the case, Prosecutor Zhu Xiyu deemed Gao to be mentally ill and rejected the case.

Gao's lawsuit is very lengthy, stating: "Yiyuan Transportation Company and more than 2,900 other companies have violated laws and regulations, hindered economic construction, and openly plundered social interests. I request a public prosecution according to law." Attached is a huge list of defendant companies, including almost all major businesses in the city. The lawsuit states that Gao is from Jiangping Lake, 43 years old, originally residing at No. 344 Jinling East Road, a merchant, whose wife runs a miscellaneous goods stall. The summons should be collected on his behalf by lawyer Mao Xianshen. The content is full of absurdity, with many clever remarks. The places he considers to be good sentences are marked with double circles. Here are some of his "good sentences": "Our country has undergone a revolution for more than 30 years. Every year, horses scream on the battlefield, and everywhere people cry for new things. Tracing the origin of the disaster, who is the evil? I am a commoner and dare to seek fame. I only hate the merchants who harm the country and only wish that every alley was full of soldiers. The cycle of heaven is endless, and the holy way will always shine in the middle of the sky. How can wise men stand idly by, making children sad? I propose to file a lawsuit according to the spirit of the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China." The witness Xu Jiqing is noted at the end.

The prosecutor's comments state: "After reviewing the lawsuit, the content is incoherent, and the plaintiff's whereabouts are uncertain, so the summons cannot be served. It has been changed to be sent to the designated recipient, lawyer Mao Xianshen, who then sent a letter stating that the filer is a madman, the matter is bizarre, and he has no knowledge of this inexplicable lawsuit. He refuses to accept it. The allegations are obviously false and extremely hateful and should not be accepted. It is hereby rejected."

### Japanese War Criminal Noya Kahei Tried Yesterday: Utterly Evasive

The military court of the Ministry of National Defense for the trial of war criminals, tried Noya Kahei, the commander of the 133rd Division of the Japanese Army, yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. The war criminal evaded all the crimes committed during the war. In order to collect evidence, the court decided to continue the trial on the 12th. According to the information, Noya Kahei, male, 59 years old, from Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, once served as the commander of the 5th Independent Infantry Brigade and the 133rd Division of the Army. In March of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), he came to Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, and held the position of garrison commander. Soon after, the Japanese government announced its surrender, but he was still waiting for orders in Hangzhou. His troops' hatred towards our military and civilians was still unappeased. On August 20th, they arrested Zhou Zheng, the deputy director of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Working Supervision Office of the Military Affairs Committee's Loyal Patriotic Army, his chief of general affairs, Xu Da, guide Xu Guang, and more than ten other people, including team leader Lou Yongjin, at the Qianjiang Bridge in Hangzhou and took them to the Zhijiang University headquarters, where they were interrogated in every possible way. That night, Zhou Zheng, Xu Guang, Xu Da, and others were shot. Lou Yongjin and others heard their screams, but the situation was urgent, so they bravely broke out and fortunately escaped the disaster. Xu Da also managed to escape because he was not seriously injured. Furthermore, in the 34th year of the Republic, the war criminal allowed his troops to loot property everywhere in the villages and towns of Hubei, Xuzhou, and Jiangling counties, and wantonly set fires and slaughtered people. After the war, the war prisoner management office of the Xuzhou Pacification Office reported by telegram to the Jinghu Garrison Headquarters to order the First Pacification District Command to arrest the war criminal for looting and sabotage, and escort him for interrogation.

### Prices Slightly Decline Yesterday: Rice Continues to Rise

Yesterday, prices generally declined slightly. Cotton yarn and cloth rose sharply and then retreated quickly. Cigarettes saw a slight decline due to the large number of shipments. Daily necessities also weakened. However, rice prices continued to rise, an exception due to reports of soaring costs in producing areas.

Rice continued its climb to a peak yesterday. The morning opening price was reported to be rising, and the main traders took the opportunity to raise prices, causing the market to soar by another 200,000. The People's Food Allocation Association sold 892.5 piculs of early rice at the market at prices of 3.8 million to 3.75 million. The owners of the goods were timid and sought to sell, but sales were sluggish on this street, and the market started to decline, eventually rising by 50,000 to 100,000. White japonica rice was priced at 4 million, up 100,000. Early rice white yuan was up 50,000. The rise in the northern market was more intense than in the southern market.

Local factory soybean oil initially fell by 300,000, but the market rebounded later, down slightly by 200,000.

However, since the Ministry of Food did not approve the re-export of third- and fourth-grade flour, sales in nearby areas have been sluggish, affecting capital turnover.

### Misunderstanding Cleared Between Students of Both the Shanghai Art School and the Shanghai New School

Art School Clarifies the Truth About Housing Disputes

Regarding the dispute caused by the Art School taking back its school building, the school claimed yesterday: "The school's Hairongzhai school building (i.e., No. 127 Yongnian Road) was rented to Jin Tai Paper Shop due to the relocation of the school's branch during the war. It was clearly stipulated at the time that sub-leasing or replacement was not allowed. The lease expired in September 1945, and the school had repeatedly notified the lessee in advance to fulfill the contract. Unexpectedly, he refused to move out, and we had no choice but to resort to legal means. We were granted a judgment ordering him to move out within a limited time, but the lessee still ignored it. Yesterday, the local court sent police officers to enforce the order. Our school obeyed the law and complied with the court's disposal. While the police officers were carrying out the order, although our students helped with the relocation, there was no intrusion or destruction. By the evening, the police officers had not completed their task and ordered the complete relocation within three days. As for the misunderstanding between the students of the Shanghai New School and our school, it was resolved after the teachers of both schools persuaded them," it said.
