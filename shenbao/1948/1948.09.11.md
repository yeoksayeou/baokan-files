### Formal Sale of Five Unit Stocks: Purchasers Should Pay Attention to Profitability; 1,242,000 Gold Yuan Sold in a Single Day; China Textile Sales Are Best, Tianjin Paper Strangely Unpopular

[Our Report] Stocks from five state-owned enterprises, including China Textile, began to be sold yesterday by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, the Central Trust of China, and the Bank of Taiwan. There was a relatively enthusiastic response from the public at various bank branches. It is estimated that the five banks sold stocks from four units, including China Textile, Taiwan Sugar, Taiwan Paper, and China Merchants Bureau, for a total of 1,242,000 Gold Yuan in one day. China Textile had the best sales, totaling 794,000 Gold Yuan, followed by Taiwan Sugar Corporation at 368,500 Gold Yuan, then Taiwan Paper Corporation at 65,000 Gold Yuan. China Merchants Bureau ranked fourth at 14,500 Gold Yuan, while Tianjin Paper Corporation received no interest at all. This also demonstrates that investors are most concerned about the profitability and security of the enterprises.

In terms of sales figures by bank, the Bank of China had the highest amount, totaling 452,000 Gold Yuan, including 391,500 Gold Yuan for China Textile, 45,500 Gold Yuan for Taiwan Sugar, and 15,000 Gold Yuan for Taiwan Paper. Next was the Bank of Taiwan, totaling 273,800 Gold Yuan, including 223,800 Gold Yuan for Taiwan Sugar and 50,000 Gold Yuan for Taiwan Paper. The Bank of Communications was third, with 238,800 Gold Yuan, including 166,000 Gold Yuan for China Textile, 64,800 Gold Yuan for Taiwan Sugar, and 8,000 Gold Yuan for China Merchants Bureau. Fourth was the Farmers Bank of China, with 218,900 Gold Yuan, including 188,500 Gold Yuan for China Textile, 24,400 Gold Yuan for Taiwan Sugar, and 600 Gold Yuan for China Merchants Bureau. The Central Trust of China was last, with 58,500 Gold Yuan, including 48,000 Gold Yuan for China Textile, 10,000 Gold Yuan for Taiwan Sugar, and 500 Gold Yuan for China Merchants Bureau.

Of the companies mentioned above, only China Textile has formal stock certificates prepared. The others only have receipts for payment of shares. For those going to subscribe, only payments are accepted in the morning, and the banks issue temporary receipts. Formal stock certificates or payment receipts will be issued the next day upon presentation of the temporary receipt after the payment has been received. Those subscribing with cash will receive formal stock certificates or payment receipts on the spot.

In recent days, the morale of rebel officers and soldiers on the border between Jiangsu and Shandong has been declining, and they have been surrendering to the National Army in Xin'an Town.

[Our Report, Hankou, 10th] The National Army's suppression troops in southeastern Henan Province are making smooth progress. The main forces of rebels Zhang Tixue and Liu Houfu south of the Xinyang-Huangchuan Highway have been defeated, with over 500 rebels killed or wounded.

### Traitor Wang Yitang Executed by Firing Squad: "I Want to Appeal!" He Shouted Before His Execution

[Our Report, Beiping, 10th] The traitor Wang Yitang, chairman of the puppet North China Political Affairs Commission, was executed by firing squad at 10:00 AM on the 10th. He was killed by two bullets. The old traitor reversed his usual pretense of being confused and shouted repeatedly before his execution, "Please have mercy, Mr. President! I want to appeal!" In the end, he even sat up on his own and died by the bullets.

The traitor Wang was sentenced to death in all three trials. He received the Supreme Court's approval for the death sentence on the 8th. The warden visited him on the 9th, and he repeatedly shouted, "Warden, save me! Please help me find lawyer Liu Han. I still want to appeal!" His spirit was as usual, and he was still reluctant to give up his old life. He did not expect the execution to be so quick. The execution order arrived in Beiping at the same time as the approval on the 7th. The court kept it a secret in advance. The guards at the First Prison were surprised when they received the order to prepare this morning. Our reporter arrived. Prosecutor Shi Pingli signed the order to bring the traitor Wang at 9:50 AM. He had not been informed in advance. When the prison officials arrived, the traitor Wang had just finished a bowl of corn porridge and two pieces of cake. He was told that the court was in session today to investigate his illness. The court was in the prison, so he did not need to bring anything. Wang happily got on the stretcher, and two prison officials carried him out of the sick ward. He was covered with a gray plaid robe and a red plaid quilt. The old traitor's complexion was ruddy. His famous gray and white beard was as messy as thatch. He looked up at the sky, as if lost in thought. The case was handled in the execution ground in the backyard of the First Prison. The traitor Wang was placed in front of the case. The prosecutor asked, "Are you Wang Yitang?" Unexpectedly, the traitor Wang opened his mouth and answered, "Yes." He asked, "How old are you?" He answered, "Seventy-one years old." He asked, "Where do you live?" He answered, "I have no home." The prosecutor then softly informed him that he had received an order to execute him today. He asked, "Do you have a will?" He answered, "I want to appeal!" At this time, the traitor Wang showed signs of tension. The prosecutor told him that an appeal was not possible! He asked, "Do you have anything to say?" Wang still said that he was not clear-headed and could not say anything. "I want to appeal!" He was told again that the appeal had been rejected. "If you have nothing to say, then we will execute you!" Wang vaguely said, "Please have mercy, Mr. President!" He was asked again, "Do you have any property that needs to be handled?" He answered, "All my property has been lost." At this time, his upper and lower lips were tightly bitten. He then said intermittently, "Please have mercy, Mr. President." When the clerk read the original confession to Wang, he still listened attentively and then said again, "Please have mercy, Mr. President." At this time, after the photo was taken and fingerprints were taken, four people carried Wang out and placed him on the ground 20 meters away from the case. The firing squad police officer asked him if he could sit up. He surprisingly responded and sat up, put on his robe, and his pain before death was unexpectedly quick. After drinking the wine, the executing police officer aimed and fired four shots at a distance of one meter. None of the bullets left the barrel. After changing the gun, he picked up a bullet from the ground and loaded it. The fifth bullet finally fired, entering the back of his head and exiting from the front right. The traitor Wang leaned to the left, groaning and gasping, for three minutes. With his last breath, the inspector ordered another shot to be fired. Again, five bullets did not leave the barrel. The sixth bullet was fired, blowing a large hole in the old traitor's left brain, and the brain matter flowed out. Even then, he continued to convulse and gasp for five minutes before finally raising his head and expiring. Half an hour later, Wang Deyong, the traitor Wang's cousin, brought fresh fruit to visit him in prison. Only after arriving did he learn that he had been executed. After waiting for a while, Wang Weiyu, the traitor Wang's grand-nephew, arrived to collect the body for burial. The traitor Wang's two daughters are both in Shanghai. There are no other relatives in Beiping. The coffin had been purchased during his time as a puppet official and will be buried in the cemetery in the western suburbs. Afterwards, reporters inspected the traitor Wang's solitary sick ward, which contained a small iron bed with white sheets. There was a box of biscuits and a pile of old books, such as "Trial Selection Sequel," leaning against the east wall. In addition, there were salted eggs, apples, bananas, etc. A colored picture of Amitabha Buddha was nailed to the south wall. The old traitor believed in Buddhism, and this must have been the object of his daily prayers for his life.

Editorial

### Increase Capital of Banks and Savings

The adjustment method for commercial bank capital was approved at the Provisional Meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 4th of this month. This is the supplementary method to Article 30 of the Measures for Consolidating Finances and Strengthening Economic Control. The stipulations therein include: (1) Those not meeting the minimum capital amount should increase it within two months; (2) Setting minimum capital amounts by district; (3) The total amount of asset appreciation should not exceed 50% of the total amount to be increased, with the remainder to be paid in cash; and (4) Those failing to increase capital to the full amount by the deadline will be ordered to suspend business by the Ministry. All these points are fully in line with the principles of the above-mentioned article. In addition to setting capital amounts by district and category, additional capital increases are specified for the establishment of trust or savings departments and branch offices in different cities and counties, and several standards and restrictions have been drafted for the revaluation of existing assets.

One of the most important points is Article 3, which sets the minimum capital amount for commercial, industrial, and savings banks, as well as trust companies, in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. For organizations structured as limited liability companies or companies limited by shares, the amount is set at 500,000 Gold Yuan. Other company structures are halved, and money shops are halved again. This is a uniform reduction of half from the originally proposed standard of one million yuan. It cannot be denied that this is a lenient measure to accommodate the difficulties of businesses, and it is based on the bank law before the war, so it cannot be said to be without basis. According to insiders, the total capital of all banks and money shops in Shanghai before the war was about 400 million yuan, which accounted for only about one-tenth of the total deposits of 4 billion yuan at that time, and only a little more than one-third of the total issuance of 1.4 billion yuan at that time. However, the deposits of the largest commercial bank in Shanghai now are only more than 700 billion, which is equivalent to only more than 230,000 Gold Yuan. Its minimum capital amount is at least more than twice the deposit amount. For most of the other banks and money shops with lower deposit amounts, the multiple is even more considerable. It should be noted that as a result of the depreciation of currency, the capital of the first-class banks before the war, which had fully paid up 5 million, 7 million, and 10 million yuan, is now less than 5 Gold Yuan when converted into Gold Yuan if they have not increased their capital. But 500,000 Gold Yuan, when converted into legal tender, has reached 1.5 trillion yuan, which is quite a large amount. Although the law allows up to 50% of the original assets to be revalued as collateral, it requires that all capital increases be completed within a short period of two months, and the increased cash must be deposited in the Central Bank and cannot be used for three months unless approved by the competent authority for legitimate purposes. This seems to be a huge burden for the banks themselves.

However, the government's reason for forcing adjustments and increasing their capital amount is to strengthen their financial resources and consolidate their credit. There are now more than 6,000 banks and money shops nationwide. Whether this number is excessive is a matter of opinion, but it is an undisputed fact that some banks and money shops are indeed weak, there are too many units in certain specific areas, competition is too fierce, expenses are too high, and their legitimate business is difficult to develop, resulting in them engaging in the purchase and sale of goods. Moreover, the trend is that banks in various countries are consolidating and gradually merging. Article 9 of the adjustment method clearly states: "Banks that are unable to increase capital according to the law will jointly reorganize and merge several banks." This is also an appropriate measure to follow the trend, not only to leave a way out for these weaker banks.

As everyone knows, all financial institutions conduct business by lending and receiving credit. Therefore, strong financial resources and a solid foundation are important conditions for business development. However, this is only one of the conditions for business development. Any bank or money shop that relies solely on its own funds to operate will find its power limited. Because capital is equal to the fund, its operation is entirely based on deposits. An increase in deposits is the real enrichment of its power. Since inflation, everyone has valued goods over money and is unwilling to save, resulting in a flood of floating capital and a daily decrease in deposits. Therefore, banks and money shops cannot even talk about development. For example, if they receive a large loan, they have to rediscount or re-mortgage to the national bank tenfold, otherwise they will have no way to transfer it. As for normal lending, the interest rate is high and the term is extremely short, which has long lost the meaning of supporting industry and commerce. This is not to say that they disregard their responsibilities and intentionally ignore their inherent tasks, nor is it necessarily due to a shortage of capital that they cannot take care of their due transactions. It is simply that there are too few deposits and turnover is difficult, especially time deposits, which are less than one-tenth of current deposits. In addition to short-term lending for meager profits, they really cannot help with the legitimate financing of general customers.

Therefore, we believe that the increase in bank capital should be viewed in several ways: First, from the perspective of diverting floating capital, it is of course very correct. Because in Shanghai alone, the total number of commercial banks, trust companies, and money shops is nearly 200. If each one increases its capital by 300,000, it can absorb 60 million Gold Yuan, which is equivalent to 180 trillion Legal Yuan, which is slightly less than one-third of the total issuance. Even if half of it can be offset by existing assets, the floating capital absorbed is still a very large amount. Second, from the perspective of enhancing the financial strength of banks and money shops, it is the right medicine for the disease, and there is no need to repeat it. Third, from the perspective of supporting industry and commerce, it is still necessary to use various methods to encourage savings and vigorously cultivate the deposits of banks and money shops. According to the deposit statistics of Shanghai banks and money shops in July recently released by the Audit Department of the Central Bank, although the number of current deposits increased by more than 90% compared with June, time deposits only increased by more than 2%, and the total number of time deposits is still only one-tenth of current deposits. It can be seen that most of these funds are still temporarily deposited, and banks and money shops are still unable to use them in large quantities. In other words, industry and commerce still cannot benefit from sufficient financing. Therefore, in addition to increasing the capital of banks and money shops, we still hope that the government and all sectors of society will quickly start with promoting savings to build a sound foundation for the national economy. As for how to arouse the interest of the general public in saving, it is related to the stability of prices, so the government's full efforts to promote the stability of general prices is the most important task at present.

[Our Nanjing dispatch on the 10th] In order to cooperate with the implementation of the Emergency Disposition Order for Financial and Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, based on the "Methods for Suppressing Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities" promulgated in January of this year, has drafted "Supplementary Key Points for Implementing the Methods for Suppressing Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities." It has been submitted to the Political Affairs Conference for approval and was issued to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on the 10th to order localities to begin implementation. The full text of the supplementary key points of the methods is as follows:

Supplementary Key Points for Implementing the Methods for Suppressing Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities:

(1) From August 19, 1948, non-merchants or non-specialty merchants purchasing suppressed goods in all parts of the country should not exceed the amount needed for three months per person if the goods are for direct consumption. If the goods are needed for the business of specialty merchants, they should not exceed one-fourth of the annual amount needed (except for seasonal goods). Violators will be deemed to be hoarding, and the limits that should be suppressed may be determined by the local competent authorities based on the above standards, the categories of goods, and the supply and demand situation.

(2) If the finished products and goods stored in factories and commercial firms in various places are not supplied to the market as much as possible or the price is raised beyond the Gold Yuan price converted according to the exchange rate on August 19, 1948, without the approval of the local competent authorities, it will be deemed as profiteering.

(3) Factories and commercial firms in various parts of the country that purchase and sell suppressed goods should report the output, purchase, sales, and inventory (finished products, raw materials, and important materials) of the previous month to the trade association in the first ten days of each month, which will then be forwarded to the local competent authorities for verification.

(4) For important cities designated by the Executive Yuan, the local competent authorities should implement warehouse inspection methods jointly with the relevant agencies, which should be formulated by the local competent authorities based on the actual local situation, submitted to the superior agency in charge for approval, and forwarded to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for record.

(5) If the local competent authorities in places other than those mentioned in the previous article deem it necessary, they may submit a request to the Executive Yuan for approval, ordering local warehouses to report on a regular basis the names, addresses, occupations, types, quantities, and storage dates of the goods stored in the warehouses, and may conduct inspections when necessary.

(6) Article 17 of the Methods for Suppressing Hoarding and Profiteering of Important Daily Necessities states that if one of the following circumstances occurs, the hoarded goods may be confiscated by the competent authorities, "and a fine of up to 1,000 yuan may be imposed," which is changed to "and a fine of up to 1,000 Gold Yuan may be imposed."

(7) The local competent authorities for implementing the Methods for Suppressing Hoarding of Important Daily Necessities are the Bureau of Social Affairs or the Department of Social Affairs (handling matters in conjunction with public security and police agencies) in municipalities directly under the central government and provincial capitals, and the county and city governments in counties and cities.

### The Thailand Democratic Party Drafts a New Plan. Restricting the Development of Our Overseas Chinese. Stipulating that Chinese Shops Employ Siamese People as Assistant Managers

[Central News Agency Bangkok, 10th] The Thailand Democratic Party yesterday drafted a plan to restrict the free development of Chinese here, which is very similar in form to what the Philippines had previously formulated. According to this new plan, all Chinese shops and warehouses must hire Siamese people as assistant managers, and the proportion of Siamese people employed must not be less than 50%. According to this, even small shops selling odds and ends must employ at least one Siamese person as an assistant manager. However, it is believed that even if the Thailand Parliament passes this bill, its implementation will be as difficult as expected. The reason is that the majority of Chinese in Thailand already have dual nationality, and if the Siamese government decides to force them to dismiss half of their original employees and hire a batch of completely inexperienced Siamese people instead, it will inevitably cause great turmoil in the market.

### 300,000 Berlin Citizens Demonstrate Against Communism; Soviet Troops Open Fire, Resulting in Bloodshed; 20-30 Killed or Wounded in Desperate Pursuit of Freedom

[United Press Berlin, 9th] This afternoon, nine or ten Soviet soldiers opened fire with hand-held machine guns on 300,000 non-communist demonstrators in the British zone of Berlin.  According to Ames, a correspondent for this agency who witnessed the event, he saw one person fall. He estimates that the Soviet troops fired approximately 60 rounds.

[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 9th] Berlin residents, resisting the Communist Party's destruction of Berlin's freedom, gathered in the British zone for a large-scale demonstration. Near the end of the demonstration, the situation near the "Victory Gate" on the border between the British and Soviet zones suddenly became tense.  Demonstrators threw stones at Soviet police jeeps, and some climbed onto the "Victory Gate" and tore down Allied flags.  Soviet police fired warning shots into the air, while German police under Soviet control shot and wounded 20-30 demonstrators. At the beginning of the demonstration, the crowds marched in formation, maintaining order, each carrying banners and flags with slogans such as "No freedom, no socialism" and "Strive for freedom in the Soviet sector of Berlin," etc.  The demonstration was originally organized through broadcasts in four languages by the American zone's radio station. Shops and factories in the British, American, and French zones all closed at noon in response.  The main body of the demonstration was led by the red, black, and gold Weimar Republic flag. Social Democratic Party leaders gave speeches to the demonstrators, denouncing the current situation as no different from the Nazi era. The Mayor of Berlin strongly condemned the attack on the City Hall by rioters, saying, "This is the beginning of the destruction of freedom. We want to fight for the freedom that citizens should receive, and we will never recognize the control of the City Council by rioters. Our task is to defend Berlin, and we will fight to the death for freedom."

[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 9th] According to authorities, in today's anti-demonstration, in addition to two German police officers from the Soviet sector being stoned to death by the crowd, approximately 20-30 demonstrators were shot and wounded.  The German police opened fire because demonstrators climbed onto the "Victory Gate" and tore down the Soviet flag.  The German police immediately shot and wounded six or seven flag-tearers, two of whom were seriously injured. At this time, a jeep of Soviet sector police arrived, and the crowd attacked the police jeep with stones. The police then opened fire again, wounding several people. After the police opened fire, Soviet representatives went to the border of the British zone to discuss the situation with British military police representatives. The demonstrators were then driven back by British military police, and the situation was prevented from escalating further.

[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 9th] The ADN German news agency, registered in the Soviet sector, claimed that today's demonstration was instigated by fascist youth affiliated with the Social Democratic Party. They stormed into the Soviet sector, climbed onto the Victory Gate, and threw stones at pedestrians. Soviet sector police were therefore forced to open fire to stop the demonstration. The fascist youth were clearly willing to do anything to provoke a bloody incident. The news agency estimated that the demonstration involved about 300,000 people.

### Three Envoys Receive New Instructions; Preparing to Meet Molotov; British Prime Minister, Despite Illness, Presides Over Emergency Cabinet Meeting

[Our Own Report] London, 10th (broadcast from Moscow).  Western envoys have reportedly received new instructions from their governments and will meet to discuss them on the 10th. It is understood that the three-nation envoys may request another meeting with Molotov to discuss the Berlin situation and the upcoming Four Power Foreign Ministers Conference.

[Our Own Report] London, 10th (broadcast). Bevin reviewed the Berlin issue at a cabinet meeting on the 10th, and raised three possible courses of action regarding the attitude Britain should take: (1) end negotiations with the Allies; (2) continue negotiations; (3) continue negotiations, but demand that the Soviet Union explain the purpose of the Berlin harassment.

[Agence France-Presse London, 9th] The British Foreign Office stated that the situation resulting from today's demonstration in Berlin is "very serious". At the same time, US Ambassador Douglas, French Ambassador Massigli, and British Undersecretary of State Strang met to discuss the latest reports from Berlin.

[United Press London, 10th] The British cabinet on the 10th studied several possible "second steps" to deal with the Berlin crisis.  At the same time, a Foreign Office spokesman expressed regret over the "series of events" in that area, saying that the frequent incidents posed a problem for Soviet agreements. The cabinet held its first full cabinet meeting in six weeks to consider the Berlin crisis. Prime Minister Attlee, although bedridden with duodenal disease and a foot ailment, struggled to leave the hospital and attend to preside. However, the focus of attention was the heavily pregnant Foreign Secretary Bevin. Bevin gave a long account to the cabinet ministers of the failure of the summer negotiations with the Soviet Union and the recent unexpected events in Berlin. Bevin especially emphasized the Soviet army's shooting on the 9th at anti-communist demonstrators who tore down the Soviet flag. The special session of Parliament is about to open next week, and the cabinet is busy preparing, but serious problems are coming one after another, such as: (1) Whether the West intends to continue negotiations with the Soviet Union in Berlin or Moscow to reach an agreement on the German currency system and the Berlin blockade? (2) What measures will the West take to deal with the escalating unrest in Berlin? (3) How much information does Bevin intend to reveal in his report to the parliament next week about the negotiations with the Soviet Union? (4) What will Defense Minister Alexander say to explain the delay in the three-year demobilization and the extension of the term of service when reporting to the members of the parliament? Although there are many problems, everyone is concerned about Berlin. The series of events in that area is increasingly affecting East-West relations. People here are particularly concerned about the events of the evening of the 9th, and anticipate that the Soviet Union will lodge a strong protest because the national flag was removed and torn apart, stating that it is more brutal than the Nazis.

### German Social Democratic Party Plans to Expose the Soviet Political Police's Atrocities

Stating that it is more brutal than the Nazis.

[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 9th] The Social Democratic Party is drafting a nine-page memorandum on Soviet acts of terror. Brandt, a Berlin representative of the SDP executive committee, said, "We remember every incident of persecution, and when the time is right, we will hold the perpetrators accountable." He added, "The inhumane crimes of the Soviet political police are often worse than the terror of Hitler."

### British Cabinet Passes Principle of Extending Military Service Term

The Communist Party issued a declaration on the 10th, calling on workers to use force to establish a communist government.

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 10th] Queuille continued to consult with various parties on cabinet formation matters, and the chances of success have increased compared to before. After his consultation with Socialist Party leader Ramadier, Queuille declared that the Socialist Party had decided to sacrifice its economic and financial policies and give its full support to his cabinet formation, which is an indispensable condition for his cabinet formation. Socialist Party leader Ramadier also stated that the situation is progressing favorably, and if Queuille attends the National Assembly this afternoon, he may receive the support of a majority of members. Independent Republican Party leader Chriscinguet told the press that the situation has not yet reached the point where his party can issue a clear statement of its position.

[United Press Paris, 9th] French police and government guards clashed on the 9th with about 100 protesters attempting to break into the Élysée Palace. Both the French Communist Party and De Gaulle's faction are trying to prevent the formation of a new French government. The short-lived clash occurred outside the presidential palace where President Auriol resides. Protesters threw stones from the paving of the sidewalks at the military police, while others used chairs from sidewalk cafes as weapons, but the military police were strong enough and the protesters were dispersed. De Gaulle's supporters have openly called for new general elections, while French Communist leader Thorez addressed party members, calling for the Communist Party to participate in the government.

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 10th] It was revealed today that as many as 65 police and security force officers were injured in yesterday's riot at the Renault car factory.

### Soviets Restricting Berlin Airlift; US Resolutely Rejects

[Our Own Report] London, 10th (broadcast from Berlin): The Soviet Union's attempt to restrict the American airlift to Berlin has been rejected by the US authorities. The Soviet Union officially informed the Berlin Four Power Air Safety Center, requesting the US to notify the Soviet Union of the details of each airlift before takeoff, saying that this measure was necessary "for safety considerations." The US Air Force replied that American pilots are able to comply with the Four Power flight rules, and that the information provided to the Soviet Union on a daily basis is sufficient to meet their needs. The Soviet Union's request came only half a day after the anti-communist demonstration in Berlin resulted in a bloody tragedy. According to a US Air Force officer, the Soviet Union's true intention is to control the American airlift to Berlin.

### North Korea Cables US and Soviet Governments Requesting Withdrawal of Troops from North and South Korea; Full List of New North Korean Cabinet Released

[New Asia, Seoul, 10th] According to a Pyongyang broadcast, the first resolution of the first meeting of the North Korean Supreme People's Assembly on the 9th was to cable the US and Soviet governments to withdraw troops from both North and South Korea simultaneously. The cable stated: "It has been three years since Korea was liberated from Japanese oppression, but what the Korean people expect - complete independence - has not yet materialized. Due to the separate occupation by the US and Soviet armies, the division of Korea has been formed, causing the Korean people to suffer various economic, political, and cultural pains. The Japanese troops in Korea have long been disarmed and repatriated to Japan. There is no longer any need for the US and Soviet Union to station troops in Korea.

People without confidence generally claim that a civil war will break out in Korea after the withdrawal of US and Soviet troops, but all parties participating in the People's Republic, regardless of left, right, or center factions, can guarantee that no civil war will occur. On September 26, 1947, the Soviet side proposed a simultaneous withdrawal, and the US military also proposed a withdrawal. We express our deep gratitude for this, and again ask the governments of the two countries to withdraw their troops from Korea simultaneously."

[New Asia, Seoul, 10th] According to a Pyongyang broadcast, the new cabinet of the North Korean People's Republic has been organized, and the list is as follows:

Premier of the Cabinet: Kim Il-sung, Deputy Premiers: Park Hon-yong, Hong Myong-hui, Kim Chaek. Chairman of the National Planning Commission: Chung Chun. Minister of National Defense: Choe Yong-jin.

### The Establishment of the Berlin Agreement in the Yalta Conference by the US and the Soviet Union is Not a Fact; "The Hopkins Memoirs" Revealed

[United Press Washington, 9th] Collier's magazine published "The Hopkins Memoirs" edited by Sherwood on the 9th, saying that the United States did not agree at the Yalta talks that Soviet troops should enter Berlin first, and if possible, the United States planned to capture Berlin itself. Hopkins wrote this memoir before the San Francisco Conference to deny the news published by columnist Pearson in April 1945. According to Pearson's article, the reason why the American troops who arrived outside Berlin withdrew was because an agreement was reached with the Soviet Union in Yalta that Soviet troops should enter Berlin first. Hopkins called this statement "completely inaccurate" and said that in fact this issue was not discussed at all in Yalta. He said that the Western Allied military leaders and senior Soviet strategic officials all agreed that "we should all strive to move forward." Hopkins continued that the claim that General Bradley stopped at the Elbe River at the request of the Soviet Union to allow Soviet troops to enter Berlin first was also inaccurate. Bradley did have a division of the army approaching Potsdam at the time, but the division was too far forward and had completely insufficient supplies. Anyone with a little military knowledge knows that if we could have entered Berlin, we would have captured it. If so, it would have been an honor for the Army Department." Schert elaborated on Hopkins's last visit to Moscow to negotiate President Truman's meeting with Premier Stalin in Potsdam after the war. He said that Stalin told Hopkins at the time that he firmly believed that Hitler was not dead, "and had escaped by submarine."

However, in order to promote economic exchanges between Korea and Japan, the Korean government has considered concluding a special arrangement before the conclusion of the treaty. As for the bad Koreans living in Japan, they can be sent back to Korea." Cho finally mentioned the issue of Tsushima Island and said: "President Syngman Rhee hopes to recover Tsushima Island. Historically speaking, Tsushima Island belonged to Korea 300 years ago."

### Second Meeting of the Senate Assembly; Quiet Atmosphere in Nine Bureaus' Interrogation; Group Review Meetings to be Held Today and Tomorrow

[Our Own Report] The first session of the seventh meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Senate was held at 3:30 p.m. yesterday in the assembly hall of the Senate. 142 senators attended, and Mayor Wu, Secretary-General Shen, and the heads of the city government's bureaus and departments were present. First, Speaker Pan reported that today's agenda was for senators to raise questions to the nine bureaus of finance, education, land administration, public utilities, public works, police, civil affairs, health, and social affairs, and for the heads of each to answer them separately. However, as time was limited, please seize the opportunity as much as possible. Then the interrogation began. The number of questions raised yesterday was less than in previous assemblies. Only one person raised questions to the Finance Bureau and the Civil Affairs Bureau. More questions were raised to the Education, Public Utilities, and Social Affairs Bureaus, but the content was mediocre and there was no climax. All the questions were completed at 7:15, and the meeting adjourned immediately. There will be no assembly today and tomorrow. Group review meetings will be held separately. The third meeting will continue on the day after tomorrow (the 13th) from 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. to discuss proposals.

House Donation and Land Price Tax Must Be Adjusted

The senators' questions to the bureaus were as follows: Finance Section; Only Jiang Hao raised questions. Director Tian replied that the bureau has thoroughly investigated the matter of merchants colluding to delay the payment of business tax to make a profit. No similar cases have been found, but several cases of attempted extortion have been found and have been sent to the court for investigation. As for business tax, which is the lifeblood of the municipal government, the bureau is determined to find ways to collect it as scheduled. In the past, the Finance Bureau collected last year's taxes this year, but now it has achieved collecting this quarter's taxes this quarter. The Finance Bureau has always taken into account the people's burden and is unwilling to create new items to collect taxes. However, as things stand now, it is impossible to maintain and it is necessary to moderately adjust the house donation and land price tax to make up for it.

Schools in the Zhabei District are Occupied and Cannot Be Dealt With

Education Section: The questioners included Zhang Zhihan, Jiang Haoran, Ji Xia, Zhang Ji, etc. Director Li gave the following comprehensive answers: (1) The Senate previously resolved to increase the number of classes by 200. The reason why they have not been added is because the municipal government's finances are stretched and it cannot proceed. With the approval of the mayor, 53 classes have been temporarily added, and more will be added in the future. (2) The matter of donating schools has not proceeded because some unscrupulous people took advantage of it, causing disputes. In the future, the Education Bureau will allow the establishment of schools with definite addresses, property rights, and title deeds. The funds for donating schools in the previous period have already been issued. (3) Schools in the Zhabei District were occupied during the enemy and puppet period, and were forcibly occupied by soldiers after the victory and have not been moved out. The Education Bureau is in a very difficult situation, because military agencies are not only impossible for educational agencies to deal with, but even government agencies are helpless. It is now planned to ask the Garrison Command for assistance. (4) The Education Bureau has repeatedly submitted documents to the central government for the subsidy fees for the losses suffered by schools in the Zhabei and other districts due to the war, but all have been unanswered. The power is not in our hands, and we can only sigh that we have more than enough heart but not enough strength. (5) To popularize education, more municipal schools must be established. The Education Bureau will do its best. As for increasing education funds, it will also strive for it. It has been found that the percentage of education funds in the city this year is 22.5%, while according to the central government's regulations after the implementation of the constitution, the funds of the municipalities should be more than 35%. (6) The conflict between the principal and teachers of Boai Primary School due to the distribution issue has now been resolved. The Education Bureau will investigate the truth again. If the situation is serious, they will be dismissed. (7) There are no schools within three or four miles near the 8th district of Longhua District, making it difficult to attend school. It is hoped that the local authorities can plan to add them, and the Education Bureau will assist.

People's Land Not Yet Returned Due to Military Priority

Land Administration Section: The questioners included Cao Jun, Yu Chuanding, and Qu Cheng, etc. Director Zhu replied as follows: (1) During the enemy and puppet period, 340,000 mu of people's land in the Jiangwan District were enclosed and occupied. The people's land occupied by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Zhenru Radio Station, and the Longhua Airport was quite large. The reason why it has not been returned is because most of the occupants belong to military agencies. Repeated contacts have yielded no results. During the period of suppression of the rebellion, the central government clearly ordered that military affairs should be given priority. Therefore, except for a part that has been returned, the rest has been requisitioned by various agencies at a price. After the senators went to Beijing to petition, the establishment of the review committee was approved. The Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Communications, and other departments sent representatives to participate and resolved to complete the clearing within three months. Seven cases have been resolved, and the rest will be reviewed as soon as possible, and the resolutions will be sent back to the owners. (2) The Land Administration Bureau is too slow to handle affairs and the procedures are cumbersome. It will continue to improve in the future. (3) The valuation work cannot be as ideal as it should be due to the impact of price fluctuations. It can be improved in the future.

### City Ferry Service Ends Too Early; Should Find Ways to Appropriately Extend Hours

Public Utilities Section: Councilors who raised questions included Chen Peide, Shi Zongde, Wang Guoxian, etc. Director Zhao Zengjue responded comprehensively as follows: (1) The city ferry service stops too early at night, causing inconvenience for travel to and from Puxi. This is to save gasoline and diesel. It is proposed that the city ferry company appropriately extend the sailing hours based on the number of passengers on each route. (2) The power supply in the Jiangwan area is not normal, mainly because there are many military institutions in the area, which waste a great deal of electricity during peacetime. Measures must be taken to avoid this. It is hoped that the military institutions will restrain their subordinates slightly so that the power supply in Jiangwan can return to normal. (3) The water supply problem in the western district of Shanghai is currently being vigorously improved. The self-flowing system is expected to be completed by the end of this year. 18-inch water pipes will be installed from Xietu Road, Jinyi Bridge, to Wanping Road and the intersection of Avenue Petain. After completion, it should be able to supply 100,000 households every day. (4) Transportation companies feel quite difficult after the gasoline price increase. According to the Executive Yuan's approval, only public utility oil is allowed to be priced at the old price of 819. The price of oil for transportation companies must be approved by the Executive Yuan, and the Public Utilities Bureau will provide assistance.

### Repairing Hongqiao Road Has Nothing to Do with the Wealthy

Public Works Section: Councilors who raised questions included Zhang Zhongyuan, Yan Esheng, Xi Xia, etc. Director Zhao Zukang responded as follows: (1) The phenomenon of water accumulation on the roads has indeed improved compared to before the war. There is no longer water accumulation on Jiangsu Road and Route Tenant de Tournon. Conditions in the former French Concession have also improved. The Public Works Bureau complains about being poor every day, and the progress of various projects is indeed hindered. (2) The work of repairing suburban areas has already begun. Repairing Hongqiao Road is not because it is a road used by the wealthy and prominent in that area. Other major roads will also be under construction. (3) Cracking down on illegal construction is the duty of the Public Works Bureau. It is hoped that citizens will report such cases, and the Public Works Bureau will thoroughly enforce the law. (4) The accumulation of debris along the roads in the Yangshupu area obstructs traffic and measures will be taken to remove it.

### Police Officers' Attitudes are Unsatisfactory; Strict Attention Should be Paid

Police Affairs Section: Councilors who raised questions included Shi Zongde, Chen Peide, Wang Guoxian, Pan Jiemei, etc. Director Yu Shuping responded as follows: (1) The reason why the new house numbers after the reorganization have not yet been issued is because they have not yet been completely sorted out and will be distributed uniformly within days. (2) The reason for the increase in the price of rickshaws, according to the rickshaw pullers, is that the fines have increased sharply. According to the regulations, the fine for vehicle violations was changed to 1.6 jiao after the currency reform. Later, after the National Government announced the restoration of the pre-war regulations, it was changed to collecting more than one yuan and less than sixty yuan. (3) Police officers' service spirit in the police stations is not good, and they sometimes arbitrarily make fun of citizens, and often shirk responsibility in the event of accidents. Strict attention should be paid to this, and if discovered, punishment will be added.

Self-Defense Corps Not Yet Realized Due to Lack of Funding

Civil Affairs Section: Only Li Hua raised a question, asking why the People's Self-Defense Corps has not yet been realized. Director Zhang Xiaosong replied: The budget and plan have been prepared, but the reason for not realizing it is due to lack of funding. Once funding is available, it can be organized.

No Price Increases for Western Medicine Heard of; Selling Diseased Pigs is Inaccurate

Health Section: Councilors who raised questions included Zhang Zhihan, Fan Shoujian, Chen Peide, etc. Director Zhang Wei responded: (1) Prices absolutely adhere to the price limit. The statement that prices exceed the old price of 819 is absolutely inaccurate. However, if the boatmen arbitrarily raise prices during transportation, it is beyond the control of the Health Bureau. (2) No price increases for Western medicine have been heard of so far. If black market prices are found, it is hoped that they will be reported. (3) The rumor that pigs are sold at the market at parity prices is definitely not true, because the Health Bureau's inspection has always been very strict. (4) The matter of establishing a traditional Chinese medicine hospital is being discussed with the Ministry of Health.

### No Goods Being Replenished is Absolutely Not True

Social Affairs Section: Councilors who raised questions included Zhang Zhongyuan, Yan Esheng, Chai Zikai, Fan Xipin, etc. Director Wu Kaixian responded: (1) The statement that merchants are panicked that goods cannot be replenished after the strict price limit is absolutely not true. It is purely a morbid psychology of the merchants. If there are indeed difficulties, they can report to the Social Affairs Bureau so that wholesalers can be sanctioned. (2) Although cigarettes are not daily necessities, if they are purchased in large quantities with the intention of hoarding, it is also a violation of the law and should be banned. (3) The use of US aid as funding for the Rural Reconstruction Committee of this city is because Shanghai citizens have already enjoyed the rice allocation portion of US aid, and the remaining funds will be used for the reconstruction of other rural areas.

### Jiang Jingguo Encourages the Industrial Sector to Promote the New Economic Policy; Shanghai's Stability Depends on Workers' Cooperation

Shanghai Economic Supervisor Jiang Jingguo, since his arrival in Shanghai to preside over the implementation of the new economic policy plan, has been very effective in stabilizing prices. The city's industrial sector, to express their respect, held a grand welcome meeting at the City Stadium on Southwest Shaanxi Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. In addition to Mr. Jiang, those who attended included Vice Minister Lu of the Central Agricultural and Industrial Department, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, Director Shui of the Trade Union Council, and more than 3,000 directors and supervisors of trade unions throughout the city. After Mr. Jiang arrived, the workers applauded enthusiastically, and the sound shook the building for a long time. Director Wu gave a brief introduction, and Supervisor Jiang gave a speech in the midst of cheers, encouraging comrades in the industrial sector to assist in the implementation of the new economic plan. He said that the general public believes that Shanghai is a wealthy place, but in fact, most people are extremely poor. Those who enjoy happiness are not representatives of the people of Shanghai. The majority of workers and farmers can represent the true people of Shanghai. Due to the manipulation of speculators, legitimate productive industries are being suppressed, which is a violation of the Three Principles of the People, because the Three Principles of the People support honest and legitimate industries, protect producers, and overthrow non-producers. The implementation of the new economic policy this time is a revolution to transform society and eliminate unfair phenomena in society. In the future, anyone who destroys finance will be severely punished. Shanghai's stability requires the elimination of those who make war fortunes, speculators, adventurers, and bad merchants. This depends on the unity and cooperation of workers throughout the city. It is hoped that trade union comrades will continue to cooperate, generate new forces, transform the old evil environment, and our mission can be successful. Finally, Shui Xiangzhai gave a reply. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.

This afternoon at 3:00 PM, he will host the economic editors of various newspapers.

[Our Newspaper] The supply of cigarettes in this city is difficult to purchase due to the manufacturers' low shipment, wholesalers' refusal to sell inventory, and scalpers' rush to purchase retail shipments, resulting in a shortage in the market.

(2) The finished products of factories producing daily necessities should all be purchased by the government, and funds and raw materials should be provided to enable them to have reproductive capacity. (3) Daily necessities should be distributed by the government in accordance with the population. (4) The control of commodity prices and the adjustment of materials throughout the country should have unified and effective methods. (5) At present, there is no way out for speculative capital, and the government should quickly guide it into productive enterprises.

### Cooperate to Suppress Prices; Paint Sold Collectively; Penicillin and Sulfa Drugs Distributed; Available in All Pharmacies

The Paint Trade Association of this city, in order to eradicate price gouging and manipulation by people outside the industry and effectively suppress prices, has organized its members to voluntarily collect the paints needed on the market for collective sale.

### Ten Years in a Flash; The Mint "Resurrects"; Ordered to Actively Reorganize; Opens Casting on the 11th of Next Month

[Our Newspaper Special] Since the currency reform order was announced, everyone knows that the busiest agencies are the Economic Supervisor's Office, the Central Bank, the Economic Police, and the Suppression and Construction Brigade, but few people know that the tension of the work of the Central Mint is no less than that of the above agencies. They are preparing to resurrect the mint, which has been paralyzed for ten years and is the leading mint in the country, within two months. This is almost an impossible miracle, because the plant suffered too much loss during the war. The machine factory buildings were either dismantled or destroyed, and almost all the equipment was lost. However, all the employees of the factory deeply know the importance of the mission entrusted by the times, and under the leadership of Director Wei Xianzhang, they worked day and night to repair and determined to complete the great task of resuming work.

On August 10, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Finance summoned Director Wei to Beijing by telegram without explaining the reason and limited Director Wei to resume work at the mint within half a month for no apparent reason. Director Wei almost suspected that the minister had gone mad under the order. Is such a short time possible? However, subordinates are not allowed to resist their superiors and silently accepted the order. After returning to Shanghai on the 11th, he immediately summoned the old staff and started to reorganize on the 15th. The currency reform order was issued on the 19th, and all the employees realized what was happening and their spirits were greatly boosted, and the reorganization work progressed rapidly. Director Wei told reporters yesterday with great certainty: The trial operation will be on the first of October, and official resumption of work will be possible on the eleventh of October. The first thing to be cast will be the half-yuan silver subsidiary coin and the one-cent copper coin. 10,000 ounces of silver will be transported from the Central Bank within days. The silver dollars that are now being collected by various banks will be the raw materials here in the future. Various copper-nickel subsidiary coins returned by Japan will also be sent to the factory for reorganization and recasting. The mold for the half-yuan silver coin is still being engraved. The front side is the president's portrait, and the center of the back side is the words "half yuan". Underneath is double grain ear, and on top is the words "Republic of China 37th Year" (see picture). Each silver coin weighs five grams, with 80% pure silver and 20% electrolytic copper. The size is as shown in the picture. The pattern of the one-cent copper coin is exactly the same as the half-cent coin issued in the 25th year of the Republic of China. After the start of work, 300,000 copper coins and one million silver coins can be produced every day. After the silver coins and copper coins have a considerable output, nickel coins also need to be cast urgently. All the subsidiary coins used in the country will be produced here. The development of factory affairs is in full swing. The mint, which has been paralyzed for ten years, has been regenerated due to the currency reform.

### Social Affairs Bureau Rejects Increase in Rickshaw Fares

Businessmen Plan to Apply to the Supervisory Office

[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the currency reform, the government has strictly controlled the prices of all items, using the prices of August 19th as the standard. According to inquiries from the Social Affairs Bureau, the price limits for rickshaw and pedicab fares are still based on the prices of July 31st, which were set according to the July price levels. The daily fare for a two-person pedicab is 1.15 million legal tender, for a single-person pedicab, 920,000 legal tender, and for a rickshaw, 570,000 legal tender. However, because the prices of goods before August 19th had already fluctuated, the rickshaw fares were not adjusted in time. In fact, there is now a black market for rickshaw fares, with daily fares for pedicabs around 3 million legal tender, more than double the previous amount. Recently, businessmen requested the Social Affairs Bureau to increase rickshaw fares, but the Social Affairs Bureau did not consider it. It is said that the businessmen still plan to apply to the Economic Control Supervisory Office.

### Clerks of the District Prosecutor's Office, Etc., Dismissed, Submit Appeals

[Our Newspaper's Report] Not long after the new Chief Prosecutor Zhang Yuquan took office at the District Court Prosecutor's Office, eight clerks, including Xu Qiwu, suddenly received orders from the Ministry of Judicial Administration on the 17th of last month, simultaneously dismissing them from their positions, without stating the reasons. Xu and the others believe that they have been dutiful and law-abiding since joining the office. Some of them have even been qualified and have received annual performance evaluations, promotions, or awards, all of which are documented. It is unexpected that they would be collectively dismissed without cause when the head of the office changed. They believe that this is an unprecedented event and may undermine the good system of the judicial community. Therefore, Xu and the others, based on the facts, have separately sent letters to the President's Office, the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and other relevant agencies and organizations, appealing the truth of the matter.

Guan happened to be unemployed, and Zhao introduced him to Zheng. Zheng showed a business card, and Guan saw that the card listed him as the station master of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway's Hangzhou Station. Guan warmly welcomed him and immediately begged him to find him a job. Zheng readily agreed, but said that he needed an activity fee of 150 million legal tender. Guan handed over the full amount. Three days later, Zheng visited Guan again, falsely claiming that the matter had been arranged and that he could start work as soon as he received a letter. Guan was extremely excited and said that he also had an older brother, Guan Zheng, a sister-in-law, Guan Qingxia, and a younger sister, Guan Jingyi, and asked if Zheng could also find work for them. Zheng readily agreed and took another 200 million legal tender as an activity fee. Several days later, Guan went to the Hangzhou Railway Station in Hangzhou to inquire, only to learn that this person had been dismissed long ago. He quickly returned to Shanghai and inquired at the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Office on North Sichuan Road, and was told that this person had also left his job long ago. He then realized that he had been swindled. He found Zhao and went to the Yulin Road Police Sub-bureau to file a complaint. After investigation by Section Chief Rong, it was found that Zhao was not involved. Zheng Jiafan was arrested yesterday and taken to the bureau for questioning, where he confessed to the fraud.

### Jiading Headless Murder Case: Chen Shoutao and Others, Partners of Shanghai Fuda Wine Workshop, Indicted

[Our Newspaper's Jiading 9th Report] Regarding the case of the unidentified male corpse found in a wheat field in Gu Cai Wan, Chengqiao Township, on April 24th of this year, after multiple investigations by the County Police Bureau, the main criminals Chen Shoutao and Tang Yongquan were finally apprehended on the 16th of last month and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. An indictment was filed on the 8th. The details are as follows: Chen Shoutao, Tang Yongquan, and the deceased, Li Heyun, were originally apprentices at the Xinshengtai Wine Workshop in Tangqiao Town, Pudong. Later, Chen and Li left the Xinshengtai Wine Workshop in January of this year and jointly opened the Fuda Wine Workshop in Shanghai. Soon after, Tang Yongquan also joined the workshop as a partner. Before long, Tang and Li began to compete for personal gain, leading to resentment and hostility. On April 21st of this year, Chen Shoutao and Guang Yongquan secretly conspired in Pudong to lure Li Heyun to Jiading, intending to kill him after getting him drunk, so that they could take over the Fuda Wine Workshop as their own. The murder plot was decided. The next afternoon at 6:00 PM, Shoutao and Yongquan lured Heyun into taking a car to Jiading. At 7:00 PM that evening, they went to a small hotel in Dongmen to get him drunk. At around 8:00 PM, they took him out of the hotel and dragged him to a wheat field near the Tang residence in Gu Cai Wan, Chengqiao Township. Shoutao knocked Heyun down, and Yongquan rode on Heyun's body, tightly gripping his throat, preventing him from making any noise. Shoutao rode on Heyun's lower body, holding a sharp blade, and stabbed him violently in the abdomen and waist. Yongquan also swung a knife, adding to the injuries. Heyun was killed on the spot. The next day, Chen and Tang returned to Pudong. Two days later, the deceased's mother, Li Xu, came to the shop to look for her son. Shoutao falsely told Li that Heyun had gone to Nanjing. The next day, Yongquan and Shoutao forged a letter from the deceased to his mother, stating that Heyun was now working as a clerk in the Nanjing Garrison Command and advised his mother to return home quickly and not to visit him in Nanjing, adding that he could hand over his shares of the shop, etc. Shoutao then instructed Yongquan to post the letter in Nanjing. After receiving the letter, Li settled the accounts with Shoutao, and Shoutao took over the Fuda Wine Workshop. Yongquan returned to the city and became the food affairs officer at Hengmao Construction Company. After receiving a tip-off, the County Police Bureau arrested Chen Shoutao and Tang Yongquan one after another, and the headless murder case was finally solved.

### Wuxing Salt Sold at Limited Prices: Wuxi Smuggling Materials Out of the Area

[Our Newspaper's Wuxing 9th Report] Since the government controlled prices, salt merchants here have cited reasons such as difficult sourcing or increased salt taxes, and shops selling table salt limit purchases to half a catty per person, or even refuse to sell in smaller quantities.

A total of 14,267 dan were found, which is sufficient to supply until the end of the year. However, the salt merchants wanted to raise the salt price to 1.5 jiao per catty (the original price was 5 fen per catty).

However, the salt merchants are still unwilling to supply it in large quantities.

### A Poor Couple in Guizhou Reenacts "Returning to the Kiln"

— By Our Reporter Liu Mengchi

[Our Newspaper's Guiyang 7th Dispatch] At around 5:00 PM yesterday (the 6th) in the Riverside Park here, a scene from the play "Returning to the Kiln" was reenacted, played by a middle-aged woman in tattered clothes and a homeless man who had just returned to Guizhou from Chongqing. A crowd gathered to watch, and the news spread far and wide. Among the small figures in this great era, they are not the only couple to have encountered such a situation. However, their reunion, which was both bizarre and ultimately sad, is a serious social problem.

A Wandering Person Li Anguo

The homeless man, Li Anguo, is from Qianxi and is nearly forty years old this year. During the second year of the War of Resistance Against Japan in August, he enlisted in the army in his hometown and fought in Hubei, before moving to Xuzhou. In the suburbs of Xuzhou, he was honorably wounded while defending the country and fell on the battlefield. When the troops withdrew, he was unable to catch up and remained in the enemy's rear as a prisoner of war, imprisoned in Nanjing. Later, he was forced to serve the enemy army in transporting food, which was in July of the thirty-second year. On the evening of August 27th of the same year, he and several others who shared the same fate escaped from the devil's clutches and wandered to Shanghai. Every day, he collected discarded items in the Jiangwan area and sold them to make a living. He also worked odd jobs at the Nanguo Dance Hall, hoping to wait for the day to dawn.

Deported Back to Guiyang

Sure enough, the War of Resistance was won! In principle, he should have had a better life, but unfortunately, things did not go smoothly. A guest's coat was lost in the dance hall, and everyone said he did it during the investigation. The police station ruled to deport him, and from then on, he embarked on the path of the . . . unable to stay in Shanghai any longer. At this time, his only hope was to flee back to his hometown and resume his life as a tenant farmer.

From Shanghai, he traveled to Hankou mixed in with passengers on a ship. Relying on his strength, he worked as a porter at the dock for a while, which allowed him to come into contact with boatmen traveling up the Yangtze River, and he also learned how to row a boat. So, he helped a boat owner surnamed Lu row a boat, and he wandered to Chongqing in this way. At this time, he had saved some money. Starting on August 5th, he set off from Chongqing and walked to Guiyang, also working as a porter along the way.

A Park Meeting Between Husband and Wife

Returning to his hometown of Guizhou brought him much joy, but the high cost of living quickly consumed his savings. His long-dreamed-of hometown offered him no place to stand. In recent days, he has been plagued by illness, and even affordable medicine is beyond reach. He told people that he really didn't want to live any longer, and dying in his hometown would be enough to fulfill his wish. As if by someone's decree, his wife, Zhang Jingfang, from whom he had been separated for more than a decade, was sending a letter to the management office of the Riverside Park for her employer yesterday afternoon, and they unexpectedly "reunited after a long separation." The joy of the first half of the reunion can be imagined.

Embracing and Crying Together

According to Zhang Jingfang, her wandering husband told the onlookers: Since her husband left, she had not received any news. "Many people said you were already dead and advised me to remarry, but I never believed it. Today, you have finally returned!" She was so happy that she almost went crazy, forgetting that she should be with the onlookers. "I couldn't stay in my hometown of Qianxi and listen to people's ridicule, so I came to Guiyang to help people in the thirty-fourth year. Now I work at Li Gongguan in Taicibiao, and I can barely make a living."

They reunited on this difficult journey of life, overjoyed, embracing and crying together, comforting each other. Crying is not a solution, so they slowly walked on the willow-lined embankment of the Riverside Park, planning their future life. Zhang Jingfang has a job and is happier to have her husband back than any treasure. But her husband "has nothing," and his expression is far from the one he had when they first reunited. When the reporter asked them what they would do in the future, Li Anguo asked me instead: "Sir, are you hiring laborers?" This truly embarrassed me, and I could only respond with a bitter smile.

### Foreign Exchange Transfer of Brokerages Completed; Centralized Organization Followed by Submission to the Ministry of Finance for Review; Foreign Exchange Assets of Factories and Companies to be Handled Separately; Generally, the Deadline Will be the 18th of This Month

[Our Newspaper News] The foreign exchange transfer declaration and registration of brokerages, insurance, and trust industries in this city was largely completed smoothly by yesterday afternoon. More than 350 units reported. All data was collected and organized in the afternoon by Deputy Director Wu Bin of the Business Bureau. Director Lin Letang is scheduled to take everything to Beijing last night for review by the ministry. However, if the organization takes too much time, Lin may postpone his trip to Beijing by train until this morning. According to people in charge, among commercial banks, the four with the most foreign exchange are the Shanghai Bank, Zhejiang Industrial, Jin City, and United. Zhejiang Xingye has already sold quite a bit. Among money shops, Fuyuanju is the leading one. The foreign exchange figures for all insurance companies are not very high. When counting the foreign exchange assets of brokerages, it can be found that some of the foreign exchange they bought in the past has become privately owned due to dividends for shareholders and employees. The amount owned by legal entities is not as much as expected. This situation is especially common in small-scale brokerages. As for the amount of foreign exchange transferred, it is difficult to estimate at this time because there are many types of assets, including various foreign currencies and foreign stocks, making conversion difficult. At the same time, the future review work in Nanjing will be carefully researched to determine whether the figures reported by the brokerages are accurate and reliable, and then officially announced. The transfer of foreign exchange assets of factories and companies will be handled separately, generally requiring them to be transferred to the four banks of China, Communications, Agriculture, and Central by the 18th of this month. How this foreign exchange position will be used in the future will also be determined by the Ministry of Finance with specific measures, no different from commercial banks, money shops, trust, and insurance companies. The detailed methods for registration and transfer are also being negotiated by the Central Bank and the entrusted banks.

Due to sluggish outflows and few replenishments by rice shops, the market atmosphere is depressed and transactions are sparse. Bo rice decreased by 2 jiao, white geng rice decreased by 1 jiao, and xian rice decreased by 2-3 jiao due to the increasing amount of new xian rice on the market. Only white yuan rice has consistently held its original price due to its scarcity. Transactions in the North Market are also few, the market is very weak, and prices remain unchanged. Yesterday's arrivals were 2,685 shi in the South Market and 1,755 shi in the North Market.

Flour

Weak and soft, actual sales sluggish, transactions quiet. Although factories have no supply, the inventory in the market is still sufficient due to low sales. Therefore, supply is not lacking.

Mixed-brand flour saw little fluctuation and generally held its original level. Bran was 5 yuan 3 jiao, slightly weaker by 1 fen. The factory price for wheat remained at 10 yuan 0 jiao 3 fen.

Flat and weak. Due to sluggish sales, supply exceeds demand. Wholesale sales of soybeans have stopped. The price of oil has fallen, and factory demand is weak. The market shows a weak trend. Broad beans were opened according to limits. Many new arrivals of red sorghum were met with few sales, and the price decreased by 2 jiao. Green beans saw few transactions.

### Foreign Tea Firms Show Steady Improvement

[Our Newspaper News] According to tea magnate She Jie'an, after our government announced currency system reforms and revised foreign exchange rates on the 20th of last month, exporters in this city reported the situation abroad.

Therefore, the foreign trade of Chinese tea is becoming brighter.

In summary, the foreign tea market is showing small improvements. As for domestic tea sales, imports and exports remain the same, and the market atmosphere remains as before.

### Market Remains Calm as Usual; Credit Still Loose

The market for goods remained calm as usual yesterday, and the volume of transactions was also significantly reduced. It is reported that off-market deals of some popular goods are still rumored from time to time. The oversupply of funds has not tightened. Underground interest rates are between 1 jiao 2 fen and 1 jiao 5 fen. It is very difficult to get large amounts of money released. It often requires reserving the amount the day before to find a use for it. Due to difficulties in shipping for customers, industrial and commercial sales are sluggish, and speculative activities have disappeared. "Kicking the ball" and "scalping" activities have been swept away. Citizens also perceive that prices are stable, reversing the previous buying panic. Therefore, business is slow in all industries, and bankruptcies often occur in the business community. Those who hold orders have to demand collateral for the money they lend, as a guarantee. There were no fluctuations in any of the markets yesterday.

### Reduced Demand from All Parties, Yarn Prices Hovering Weakly, Cotton Cloth Sales Narrow, Transactions Quiet

The yarn market yesterday, with ample supply, experienced reduced demand as cloth prices fell. Colleagues felt that sales were sluggish, and raising funds was becoming unbearable.

12-pound Longtou fine cloth remained at its original level of 28 yuan. Hot-selling fine cloths saw lively bidding. Wufu, Wufu B, Labatong You B, Yanghe B, Longtou B, and other brands all saw transactions. Prices fell by varying amounts, from 2-3 jiao to 6-7 jiao.

### Worldwide Basketball Fever: U.S. Olympic Basketball Team Leader Discusses Impressions of London Games

[United Press International, New York, 9th] According to the leader of the U.S. Olympic basketball team, upon his triumphant return to America from England, "The whole world is in a state of basketball frenzy." Olympic Basketball Committee Chairman Wilkie stated, "The maturation of international basketball competition is not far off. Basketball is flourishing in Europe, and is also gaining momentum in South America. They have surpassed our ideals, displaying 100% excellent basketball skills." Wilkie and U.S. Olympic basketball team coach, Brownell, both expressed astonishment at the progress of basketball in various countries since 1936 but do not feel that the United States is in danger of losing the championship in the next or subsequent Olympic Games. Wilkie said, "We almost suffered our first defeat in history in London. We fought hard to beat Argentina 59-57." Brownell commented, "If we had used older methods, this wouldn't have happened. The Argentine team's offense was fierce, but their defense was full of loopholes. They even still use zone defense, or even older methods." Although some spectators were dissatisfied with the height of the American players, especially the seven-foot center, Klent, most welcomed the American team. The International Basketball Association discussed limiting the height of basketball players in the next Olympic Games, but the vote was 17 to 27, rejecting the restriction on tall players. After consideration, it was felt that Klent was a good basketball player and a gentle giant. Klent said, "We could have taken advantage of our height, but we decided not to. According to the 1936 rules, I could have stood under the opponent's basket as a rim protector, hitting the ball out of the basket. But we never did that even once." South America and France are particularly interested in basketball competitions, singing national anthems before each game to boost morale. They are quick in movement and accurate in shooting, especially formidable in the free-throw area. However, their methods are relatively outdated; the United States' progress in the past decade has left them far behind. Given the current popularity, basketball will not only be permanently included in the Olympic program but will also become as important as track and field and swimming.

### The Bottom Line

— Bai Shui

Until recently, I recently had the opportunity to read the wonderful poems of the American Dorothy Parker, still from the translation quoted by Mr. Zhu Ziqing (see "On the Appreciation of Elegance and Popularity," page 57). Zhu called it "common sense poetry," which is what the old British novelist and playwright W. Somerset Maugham called it in the introduction. There are originally two kinds of poems, one is an unrestrained reverie, saying whatever you want, Li Bai's type is also this, that is also a kind of "truth," but it is emotional; one is to tell the truth, to say clearly what others are unwilling to say, even stabbing a hole to fish out the truth, scolding in the street is also okay, it is even more outstandingly clever if you see through what others cannot, Tao Yuanming is this type, Du Fu is also this type, but the gentlemen who make epigrammatic poems and mottoes cannot be counted, that pedantic sourness is the pretense of a hypocrite and cannot be called the truth of poetry. Mrs. Parker has a poem called "The Bottom Line," which I think is quite good:

Razors teach you to hurt your face

Rivers wet your clothes and feet

Acids leave you scars

Drugs cause cramps and dilate veins

Bullets don't understand rules

Traps are open waiting for people

Gas is acrid and makes you want to vomit

Yet you still survive

Isn't that the truth? Although our Chinese poets also lament the hardships of life, such as "Like morning dew, the days gone by are full of suffering," these sentences are good enough, but I feel they are not strong enough in comparison! In other words, it is not concrete, there is no imagery, so it is not easy to be appreciated by everyone, the majority. From this point of view, the so-called common sense in poetry is very different from the ordinary. Teachers teach us, or books tell us, that we must not say that we will not shave because the razor hurts our face, nor can we stop taking medicine because the medicine causes cramps and dilated veins. Ordinary common sense calls this "Do not stop eating because of choking," which is not wrong, if you don't eat, you will starve to death! However, there are also those in society who have expanded "Do not stop eating because of choking" into a stain on humanity, such as war, which is originally an enlargement of the "Do not stop eating because of choking" theory. I once wrote a small article called Political Morality, saying that conquest is to force others to admit that it is reasonable with power, that murderers die, is choking, and killing to benefit the world is not stopping eating, but you say, in the end, did it benefit the world? This still needs to be investigated. According to the naive thinking of poets, it is best for everyone to put down their knives and shake hands. The beard on the face is also life, what does it matter whether you shave it or not, why make your flesh tremble in fear! Artists have long hair, there is a reason! But you can't always think of things in the world in a naive way, because you are naive, but others are not. Mr. Zhu Ziqing said in "On Telling the Truth" that the reason for not telling the truth is to guard against each other, fearing that they will be taken advantage of; that's right, people are the most useless thing, saying good things in their mouths, and tripping others under their feet, no animal is so shameless, but that is why people are people. Mencius said that what distinguishes humans from animals is subtle, common people abandon it, gentlemen preserve it, I have long said that this is nonsense, precisely because gentlemen preserve it, gentlemen are the worst. Humans use animals to scold people, if I were an animal, I would definitely use "human" to scold animals. For example, a dog can scold a dog of the same kind as "You unfaithful and unjust person!" A worker bee can scold a drone bee as "You idle person!" Ants and aphids can scold even more; "You who do not know how to love, help, and understand each other!" Why do humans scold animals? Even though they deceive them, eat their meat, sell their skin, they still scold them, how heartless! In general, the characteristic of mankind is that they can make their own traps and then drill into them themselves, dying and dying, still people die the most and the most tragically, which can also be regarded as karmic retribution! This is the common sense of poets, the bottom line calculated by poets, if cotton yarn tycoons, stock market giants, and the like heard it, they would definitely say that you are crazy and have no common sense. Strange! The most ignorant people in the world are the most knowledgeable, and they are excellent people, how can the world not be in great chaos?

This bottom line is really hard to calculate!

### The Noble Thief

— Sun Rong

In the world's top hotels, there are often "sticky-fingered" guests who take away silver-plated cutlery and towels, supposedly as souvenirs. On the British luxury liner Queen Elizabeth, thousands of pieces of tableware are lost every trip.

However, those "sticky-fingered" people are most interested in the White House, the U.S. President's residence. Knives and forks engraved with "White House" are ideal souvenirs, aren't they? As a result, every time the President hosts a banquet, many knives and forks disappear. The larger the banquet, the more knives and forks are lost.

It is said that Mrs. Roosevelt once bought a large number of knives and forks from American "dime stores" specifically for guests to steal as souvenirs.

### Recent Works by Xia An

— Ye Gongchuo

Lord Liang Yonghuai, in charge of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway project, has made great contributions for forty years. I wrote a poem to praise him:

Why not be a pioneer in opening roads, for forty years, many scenes have followed. Talented scholars compete for power, but the old master is the real dragon. The ingenuity of the wheel follows the people's wishes, and the combination of tracks can follow the wisdom of the master craftsman. Fortunately, praise is now heard on the road, and the peaches and plums planted have formed a dense green shade.

Also, two poems imitating palace lamentations

Serving in Zhaoyang for forty autumns, the new makeup is prepared without a plan; waiting to tell the story of the creation of the world, who knows that one's head gradually turns white when looking in the mirror!

Years of storing bitterness and stopping pain, old dreams only pity the blue royal body; don't be surprised by the frequent mistakes at the banquet, there are many who have been there in the song.

### Foot Pain

— Lin Lin

According to some historians: Thirty years ago, one person's foot pain resulted in the second world war.

That person with foot pain was then the president of the United States, Wilson. President Wilson had a terrible temper, often flew into a rage for no reason, making everyone around him resent him, and most members of Congress had been inexplicably insulted by him, so everyone wanted revenge. When Wilson proposed the League of Nations bill after the war, Congress saw it as a great opportunity and vetoed it without hesitation, so the United States did not join the League of Nations. If the United States could have joined the League of Nations and played a leading role in the League of Nations, then the League of Nations could have been greatly strengthened, and the Second World War might have been avoided.

But why was Wilson's temper so irritable? - It was because of his feet. He had this disease all his life, and when it hurt, it was like being cut with a knife. Wilson was a very meticulous person, usually with a bit of arrogance, so even though his feet were painful, he never complained to others, but just gritted his teeth and endured it. Coupled with his busy schedule, it was naturally easy to get angry.

There have also been other presidents in American history who often had foot pain. Lincoln said: "When my feet hurt, I don't feel like doing anything, I can't even think quietly.

According to estimates by the American Podiatric Medical Association, 70% of the American population has foot pain, totaling 100 million people. There are 53 types of foot pain, from corns to terrible cancer. The most common are calluses, moisture, ingrown toenails, and deformed toes.

The U.S. Department of Education has conducted foot examinations for students in various schools, and the results show that the vast majority of students wear shoes that are too small, affecting the health of their feet.

In addition, doctors say that it is harmless to the health of the feet for ladies and gentlemen to wear high heels occasionally in social situations; however, if they wear high heels to work, do housework, or go shopping - then by nightfall, they will be exhausted and have a terrible temper, and will quarrel over trivial matters.

The following is the advice of doctors to everyone, if you can faithfully implement it, foot pain can be reduced:

(1) After trying on new shoes, you must stand up and walk a few steps before buying them. Do not just sit down and try them on before buying them.

(2) Our left and right feet often have different sizes, so when buying shoes, you should use the size of the larger foot.

(3) Do not wear shoes barefoot, you should wear socks. The height of the socks must be at least one inch above the ankle.

(4) When doing housework, sit down as much as possible.

(5) Do not keep shoes to use as slippers. Old shoes that have lost their shape will only harm your feet and will not give you a sense of comfort.

(6) It is best not to wear the same pair of shoes every day. You should buy several pairs and wear them in rotation, which is not only comfortable, but also makes the shoes less likely to be damaged.

(7) When buying shoes for children, you must take them to try them on. Do not just bring an old shoe to buy new ones.

(8) Do not be penny-wise and pound-foolish, and use shoes that your older brother has worn for your younger brother. This concerns the lifelong happiness of your child, so do not lose sight of the big picture.

### Australian Animals

— Mao Yi

Australia has an area comparable to that of the United States, but its population is only 7.5 million.

This is the country of sheep, but pastures are extremely scarce, requiring 20 acres of land to raise one sheep. An average small ranch with 5,000 sheep occupies 20 miles in length and 10 miles in width. A large ranch occupies an area of 10,000 square miles. A large ranch can shear the wool of one million sheep in a "bumper" year.

In the last century, Australians imported a few rabbits, hoping that they would multiply and provide food. However, they multiplied so much that they numbered in the hundreds of millions and competed with humans for food. So, in order to prevent their expansion, Australians began to build a fence 1,139 miles long and four feet high. However, before the fence was completed, there were rabbits inside and outside the fence. Now, the Australian government is planning to import a disease that can kill rabbits without harming other animals.

### The Skin of the Stomach and Meat

Korea has one person who was first loyal and then disloyal, named Li Wanyong; and another person who was first not very loyal, and later became loyal, named Park Younghyo. The ancient saying goes, "The coffin lid closes, then the evaluation is final," and you cannot judge until the end. Li Wanyong, in the capacity of Prime Minister of the Korean Cabinet, signed an agreement with Ito Hirobumi to be guided by the Resident-General (Korean Emperor Gwangmu 11th year, Japanese Meiji 40th year), and an agreement with Terauchi Masatake to merge (Korean Emperor Longhee 4th year, Japanese Meiji 43rd year): and the Korean Emperor became the King Lee in Japan. Therefore, not only Korean patriots pointed and hated him, but people from all countries also despised the name of Li Wanyong. However, between the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, Li Wanyong was actually a strong anti-Japanese figure. When Empress Myeongseong was assassinated, Li was escorted to the Russian embassy, issued orders, punished pro-Japanese ministers, and persuaded Russia to use its military force to help Korea suppress Japan. For a year, the Japanese feared and loved him, and made all kinds of connections. Until after the Russo-Japanese War, when Japanese power had spread throughout Korea, he colluded with Ito and served his commands. The change of heart from beginning to end was probably due to the environment? Park Younghyo, on the other hand, supported the Japanese side twenty years ago, reformed Korean politics, offended the Korean Emperor, took refuge in Japan, and was pointed out by the Japanese as a pro-Japanese party, and Ito also approved of him. When he was appointed Resident-General, he recommended him to the Korean court, intending to give him a prominent position, but Park deeply recognized his ambitions and strongly declined. Later, after the Hague incident, the Japanese forced the Korean Emperor to abdicate, Park suddenly went to the palace to ask to be Minister of the Palace, kept the seal, and insisted on not handing it over. Subsequently, the Korean people resisted in unison, and the Japanese said that this was instigated by Younghyo, so they arrested and imprisoned him. The above two sections are from Liang Cangjiang's "A Special Record of Japan's Annexation of Korea".

### Continued Excerpts from Yun Jian's Jottings on Orchids (Middle)

— Bai Jiao

Taiwanese Orchid: With fine wine and pure delicacies, obtaining an exquisite orchid is worrisome; could it be that Ye Jia Lang from Dongting Lake is pointing at Yun Jian's new acquisition of a recently found species from Luoshan? Liangxi Zishan is about to leave; he should inform the elegant gentlemen of Jianye. It is unlikely to be available for purchase.

Exposed Root Orchid Three-Panel Screen

Does spiritual fragrance emerging from the mountains bring fortune or misfortune? However, Fu Weng comes temporarily for pure joy. Fortune arriving brings no delight, misfortune brings no alarm. The road may be rugged, but the heart remains at peace!

Taiyuan Lotus

Every time, I seek a rosy face, aided by a good sleep. For three years, this habit has not changed. Rumors have spread outside, saying that Yun Jian is very confused, either drunk or dreaming. This three-foot-long beauty is filled with the pure air of mountains and rivers. Who knows that Fu Weng, even in his drunken dreams, has obtained a treasure!

Jade Butterfly

Woke up on the morning of July 7th, the 37th year of the New Era, feeling mentally exhausted, wondering what ambitions exist in the world, and obtained this one piece.

Wind Orchid

The rain on the river is nourishing, and the wind at the eaves is gradually tightening. I closed the windows and ordered the servant boy to pull paper, planting orchids in the mountains. Unexpectedly, the wind's force reached the tip of the brush. Ah Yun, wanting to save effort, feared that it would be blown away and released his hand in realization!

Also

White clouds are in the sky, connected silently. Residing in solitude is admirable, and cannot be shaken or taken away!

Shen Ding

Ming Yizi is generous but unhappy, yet he enjoys searching for what is sweet. He will embark on a long journey, taking a plain white orchid as a token of eternal remembrance, carrying it north and telling people, "The South is desolate, only this gentlemanly flower remains!" This man praises me for understanding the essence, which is truly lovely.

Mountain Orchid

The clouds are wet and the air is steaming, indicating rain. I took off my clothes and sat casually, suddenly realizing that the mountains are high and the water is far, causing me great mental strain!

Twin-Stemmed Orchid

After drinking heavily of clam powder wine, the twin-headed flowers began to bloom. Cai Erlang saw it and laughed, saying, "Like this man, drinking my wine!" I recorded it as a source of future longing.

Heavenly Chapter Plum

A scholar observed Yun Jian's orchids and asked how to apply ink. I replied with a smile, "You must understand it yourself." He asked again, and I said, "Kumarajiva and Hui Jian said, 'Chewing food for others not only loses the flavor but also causes vomiting!'" You are not inheriting something blindly. I happened to remember this.

Thorny Orchid

Orchids are my old love, and thorns are my new acquaintance. My late father gave me a couplet: "With no remaining matters in the heart, all people before the eyes are good." This is precisely the state I am in at this moment.

Thorny Orchid Bamboo

Mr. Banqiao painted orchids and thorns together, once comparing thorns to loyal and capable officials defending the city. Yun Jian said, "This is what Emperor Guangwu knew, but what Zhu Yuanzhang found difficult! How are the officials in the remonstrance office different initially? Stinging the ears of the ruler puts them in danger, and the plan is to eliminate them, which leads to rapid demise. Why bother with a group of foolish rebels rising up with poles!"
