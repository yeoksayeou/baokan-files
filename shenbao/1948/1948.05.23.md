### President Uses Weekend Holiday to Consider Premier Candidates, Summons Wang Chonghui to Discuss Constitutional Issues

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] The selection of the Premier has not yet been proposed by the President as of the 22nd. Following Zhang Qun’s flight to Chongqing, all parties are making every effort to persuade He Yingqin. Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen has also come to Nanjing to urge him. Cheng Tianfang, Ma Chaojun, and others have visited him successively. Sun Ke visited at around 5 PM on the 22nd for a brief conversation of only fifteen minutes before leaving. He Yingqin's intention to resign remains firm, and despite the urging of various parties, he has not changed his original decision.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] It has just been learned from informed sources that after both Zhang Qun and He Yingqin firmly declined the position of new Premier, the President, with a heavy heart, will use the weekend (23rd) holiday for thorough consideration. It is also understood that it is possible to propose a new candidate from outside the Zhang-He duo. However, the identity of this third person remains unknown.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 22nd] When Wang Chonghui returned to Shanghai at 2 PM on the 21st, he had already received a telegram here recalling him to Nanjing on the overnight train. After arriving at 7 AM on the 22nd and resting briefly, he was accompanied by Chen Bulei to Huangpu Road to meet with President Chiang Kai-shek. They spoke at length for four hours, only departing after noon. According to Wang's interview with our reporter in the afternoon, his discussion with the President focused on constitutional issues. He stated: "Our country's current administrative system is neither presidential nor cabinet-based. The position of the Premier is neither like the US Secretary of State nor like the French Prime Minister. His relationship with the President and the Legislative Yuan (Parliament) is also different. Therefore, some specific aspects of the constitution are unprecedented, both in China and abroad. Furthermore, the constitutional provisions are inevitably too cumbersome, thus requiring extensive research and design." Wang studiously avoided mentioning the specific items discussed regarding constitutional issues, or whether they were related to the current situation or the difficulties the future constitutional government was about to encounter. He did not deny that President Chiang discussed the nomination of the Premier, but claimed to know nothing about the straw vote held at the KMT Legislative Committee member meeting on the morning of the 21st. Regarding the future Premier candidate, he did not comment on specific names, but stated: "Two essential conditions must be met before a decision can be made. First, the President's nomination, and second, the Legislative Yuan's approval." As for whether the nominee, once nominated and approved, is willing to take office, in light of reason and sentiment, there should be no insurmountable problem. Otherwise, it would be a violation of public opinion, an evasion of duty, and a failure to serve the country with loyalty. At this point, the reporter asked how he would react if he were chosen as Premier. He smiled and said, "I am already past the age limit and should not be forced into service again. The current situation is particularly complex and difficult, and it is appropriate for someone young and energetic to step forward and assume the heavy responsibility." At 5 PM, Wang visited Chen Bulei again and invited Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng to meet with the President to discuss potential candidates for the new Premier. As of the evening, no decision had been announced.

He will not only maintain the status quo but also strengthen them. It is also understood that there will be no changes in the personnel of the Central Bank, as Mr. Yu once held the position and many senior officials are former subordinates. Furthermore, the bank is a business organization with established regulations in each department, so the change of governor will have no effect on the business side.

### Wu Guozhen Returns to Shanghai, Denies Taking Up a New Position

I will not be leaving Shanghai for the time being." During the meeting, the President inquired in detail about the recent price situation, public security, and economic issues in the city, and gave some instructions. He also instructed Mr. Wu to assist Governor Yu Hongjun in stabilizing the city's finances and preventing fluctuations during the period before the new cabinet is formed and the new and old governors of the Central Bank hand over.

Their attack preparations have been preempted by the National Army, which destroyed their food stores. The civilian population's clearing of the fields is also thorough. The bandits cannot obtain food at the front, and they lack transportation at the rear, making supply difficult. Therefore, the bandit army is experiencing food shortages, resorting to eating leaves and fruits to fill their bellies, and many are surrendering.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 22nd] There have been no major changes in the war situation in the Northeast in the past week. The bandits' harassment of the Jin-Yu section of the Bei-Ning Railway did not achieve its goal of containing. The bandits in western Liaoning are gathering in the Rehe area, and the battle for Chengde has begun. The Communists clearly want to control the Jin-Gu Line and open a corridor along the Great Wall to connect the Northeast with Rehe and Chahar. A summary of the bandit army's movements: (1) The 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 10th Vertical Columns of the bandits in northern Liaoning have moved south of the Ping-Mei Line and may cross the central-Chang Line and flee west; (2) the 1st Vertical Column of the bandits in western Liaoning has arrived northeast of Chengde, and the 7th and 9th Vertical Columns are entrenched in the Jiuguan-Hemen Ershijiazi area; (3) the 4th Vertical Column of the bandits in southern Liaoning is attempting to cross the Liao River and flee west, approaching the railway line.

### Capital Students Cause Trouble; Authorities Determined to Handle According to Law; Ministry of Education Sends Telegram to Presidents of Central University and Jinling University to Rectify Academic Atmosphere

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1 AM on the 23rd] The number of Communist spies and professional students who were mobilized by Communist spies yesterday did not exceed 200 to 400 people. Their strength is far less than generally predicted. The military and police authorities in the capital have decided to handle them according to the law. It will not be difficult to restrain them and make them obey. However, these troublemakers have recklessly insulted an organization of the Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, which has aroused the indignation of the general party members in the capital. The Central Daily News published an editorial on the 23rd, calling on comrades with blood and enthusiasm to rise up together, save the country from ruin, and avenge the party's humiliation.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Because some students of Central University and Jinling University openly opposed the government, denigrated the head of state, and shouted reactionary slogans, which exceeded the scope of academic freedom, the Ministry of Education telegraphed Qi Shounan, President of Central University, and Chen Yuguang, President of Jinling University, on the 22nd to strictly prohibit them. The original telegram stated briefly: According to reports, yesterday some students of the two universities jointly held an evening party, performing absurd programs opposing the government and denigrating the head of state. Today, they rushed into the auditorium of Central University, shouting reactionary slogans and insulting teachers. It is also heard that they will gather on the Jinling University lawn tonight to hold a so-called great unity evening party. This kind of illegal behavior exceeds the scope of academic freedom and is clearly a planned action. In order to take care of the studies of the majority of pure youth, the Ministry cannot tolerate these few illegal and out-of-bounds elements any longer. They should be stopped immediately, severely punished, and the leading students identified and expelled from school to rectify the academic atmosphere. This is extremely important.

[Another Dispatch] The "Nanjing College and University Students Commemorative Meeting for the Anniversary of May 20th" organized by some students of Central University and Jinling University caused an incident and then used this as an excuse to launch a three-day strike. The majority of students who cherish their studies and stay clean and do not get involved have been very cold to this. The situation in the colleges of arts, sciences, law, medicine, and agriculture of Central University is even better, as if it were an ordinary day.

### Sun Lianzhong Speaks

Hoping That Young People Will Not Test the Law

[Another Dispatch] Sun Lianzhong, Commander-in-Chief of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, spoke in a serious manner about the illegal actions of a small number of students in the current Beijing City who are attempting to expand the student movement and disrupt social order. His remarks are as follows: "The country is vigorously implementing two major tasks: constitutionalism and suppression of rebellion. The responsibility is heavy. It is hoped that all the people will be united in mind and virtue to succeed. Recently, a small number of Communist professional students have mixed into the rear, launching a student movement, attempting to destroy social order in order to achieve their conspiracy to be a tiger as a tyrant. Their actions are extremely absurd and their intentions are extremely dangerous. The country cares for young people in every possible way. Closing its eyes to evil and hiding the evil of the past, punishing evil and rewarding good are the inherent responsibilities of the country. Moreover, during the emergency period of suppressing rebellion, punishment of crimes is especially urgent. We, bearing the heavy responsibility of guarding the capital, follow the government's intention and hereby re-promulgate the Emergency Crimes Ordinance Endangering the Country during the Period of Suppressing Rebellion. It is hoped that our young students will repent and not test the law. It is also hoped that they will encourage each other, and understand the difficulties of nation-building, and help each other to rise up, which is important."

[Another Dispatch] The Capital Garrison Headquarters, for the disturbance caused by some students of Central University and Jinling University, which endangers public order, has telegraphed the authorities of the two universities to advise and stop them. Otherwise, they will be severely punished according to the law.

### A Portion of Vocational Students Encircle the Youth Department

[Another Telegram] On the evening of the 21st, a portion of vocational students in the capital city held a "May 20th Commemoration Evening" at the Central University (中大), where they wantonly insulted the head of state and slandered the government, arousing the audience's indignation, which led to a conflict. At 1:30 AM on the 22nd, a group of dispersing students encountered Sun Guizhen (孫桂筠), a student from Jinling University (金大) who had performed at the evening party, near the Drum Tower Youth Department (鼓樓靑年部). After recognizing her, they dragged her to the Youth Department. The Youth Department, considering that this matter was beyond its purview, requested the security authorities to take away the two students. At 2:30 AM, approximately one hundred students each from Central University and Jinling University, using the pretext of requesting the release of the arrested students, swarmed to the Youth Department and encircled it. Subsequently, Fan Qianzhong (范謙衷), the Dean of Student Affairs of Jinling University, and Ni Qingyuan (倪靑原), the Dean of the College of Arts, secured the release of Sun Guizhen and Le Liang (勒亮) on bail from the security authorities and brought them back to the school. However, the students encircling the Youth Department not only did not return to school but became even more unruly. They smeared ink on the walls of the Youth Department building and hurled malicious insults at the Chinese Nationalist Party and the Youth Department. The department staff was unable to enter the office to work because the entrance was blocked by vocational students. Furthermore, the vast majority of students from Central University and Jinling University did not participate in this action that disrupted public order. Chen Xueping's department also issued a statement clarifying the facts.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Some students from universities and middle schools in this city held a "May 20th Commemoration Assembly" at the Jiaotong University (交通大學) square from 6:30 PM to 9:00 PM last night. They sang "The Great Advance March" and paraded around the campus. The original plan to invite Xia Kangnong (夏康農) to speak about the American support for Japan was temporarily canceled.

### Industrialization and the People's Livelihood

— Wang Zunming

In itself, an ideal is most valuable if it is perfect and comprehensive. However, it is somewhat regrettable if there is a lack of methods to achieve the ideal, as it becomes a pie in the sky, unable to alleviate the current hunger. If a way to realize the ideal can be devised, gradually approaching the ideal, it not only quenches the thirst like sour plums but also leads to a state of ultimate bliss. Democratic thought is like this. In the last one or two hundred years, it has become widely popular. Tracing the origins of democratic thought, refined concepts existed as early as the Zhou and Qin dynasties, as well as in some Greek city-states. However, its partial implementation occurred in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. During these one or two hundred years, the Industrial Revolution has been gradually completed. First, steam, then electricity, oil, and hydropower have increased the power available by dozens of times compared to the population, and have also freed people from the hardship of sweating profusely. How to utilize this enormous power? There are millions of precise spindles, as well as majestic water gates that span great rivers. From the mountains and the sea to the sky, from the cities to the deserts, all have been influenced by the Industrial Revolution. Barren lands of the past are now seas of wheat. Purple dye, fresh lychees, and velvet, which only emperors could enjoy in the past, are now enjoyed by countless people in industrialized countries. Furthermore, winter warmth, summer coolness, soaring into the sky, diving into the sea, the sounds and appearances of places ten thousand miles away are vividly before our eyes. These everyday lives of ordinary people are something that emperors of the past could not experience. As for the miraculous medicines invented in recent years, they have increased happiness and diluted disasters. Ancient emperors sought them in their dreams, believing they existed on immortal islands at sea, but unexpectedly, they are now right beside us.

Industrialization has revolutionized the mode of production, increasing wealth in clothing, food, housing, and transportation by percentages of ten to hundreds of times. With this strong foundation for distribution, it is easier to be fair, which is to move closer to the standard of democracy. The reformed mode of production reduces fatigue and lengthens leisure time, so that surplus energy can be used for enjoyment and learning beyond current production. Appropriate enjoyment accumulates work efficiency for reproduction. What is explored in learning is the understanding of the nature and relationships of things and people. For things, the further understanding that is elucidated rarely involves individuals, thus establishing objective right and wrong. Based on this publicly recognized knowledge, the further improvement of the mode of production is promoted, which will continue to increase wealth. For people, further understanding is related to oneself, and often self-interest obscures right and wrong, thus causing disputes, debates, and struggles. However, the truth always transcends self-interest, and clouds cannot hide the sun and moon for long. Industrialization has given countless people the opportunity for deep thought and exploration, and truth will emerge from error and obfuscation. After industrialization, learning is open to most people. In terms of wisdom, there is equality; in the direction of distribution, it must be fair, that is, the standard of distribution must be democratic. From the perspective of producing wealth, industrialization has prepared the material basis for democracy; from the perspective of distributing wealth, industrialization has established the demand for democracy.

Not only China, but before full industrialization, the living standards of England, America, Germany, and Russia were relatively low. In daily life, the enjoyment of the rich and the poor was obviously very different. At that time, British coal mines generally used women and children, each carrying dozens of pounds of coal, crawling and snaking through the mine tunnels. Even twenty years ago, workers in American steel mills still worked twelve-hour shifts. Every other week, the day and night shifts were interchanged. A worker had to work twenty-four hours every day for half a month, which greatly affected their health. During Imperial Russia, ordinary farmers were like the private property of the landlords; the internal passport system was used, and most farmers were not allowed to leave the land freely, legally defining the landlord's ruthless exploitation of the farmers. At that time, the common people of England, America, Germany, and Russia did not live in reinforced concrete houses, nor did they wear clean and tidy cotton or wool; only a few people enjoyed fish and meat and rode in carriages. This situation was naturally unfair and painful.

Unfortunately, to this day, the situation in our country remains stagnant in this state of poverty. Thirty years ago, the May Fourth Movement re-proposed the slogan of democracy and also raised the banner of science. This is different from talking about democracy alone for thousands of years. Pure science explores truth and establishes the philosophical basis for democracy; applied science develops production, which is also industrialization, promoting the realization of democracy. The method of realizing truth may change rapidly with the times; however, the existence of truth is constant throughout eternity. Before industrialization, the distribution of enjoyment should have been fair. After industrialization, the wealth to supply fair distribution is more abundant, and the call for fair distribution is stronger. Since the May Fourth Movement, the performance of applied science, that is, the achievement of industry, is still not much. In terms of railways, the extension is limited; in terms of rivers, floods are disastrous; mountains are barren; forests are sparse; the ocean is desolate with few fishing boats. Our country's steel production and crude oil production are only ten-thousandths of America's. Only a few cities use electric lights, and even distant brightness and darkness cannot be guaranteed. Even with the call for democracy, the material basis is poor, and most people have no choice but to cling to the edge of freezing poverty. A very small number of people crave enjoyment, and some even go to the point of committing outrageous crimes. Although they are so insane, how many of these people who commit crimes can attain the living standards of the common people in modern industrialized countries? Only by industrializing production and democratizing enjoyment can the lives of the general public be improved. Otherwise, it is ultimately impossible and uneasy to have the masses hungry while a few are full, or the masses cold while a few are warm. Without a doubt, the very serious foreign troubles of the past thirty years are the main reason for our country's weak level of industrialization; in addition, the lack of industrial talent and appropriate organization also plays a role. If all obstacles can be eliminated, full industrialization can, in the near future, have sufficient wealth to supply a fair distribution that meets democratic standards, that is, to achieve economic equality.

What will come with full industrialization is not only the increase of wealth. Work is divided into several categories. Each category is divided into several sections. Each person only does one section, which naturally becomes more refined and less laborious. The overall efficiency increases, and mutual dependence intensifies. Together, the output is ten times greater, but separated, there is no achievement. Ideas are also disseminated on a large scale. Newspapers are as dense as snowflakes. Radio is as turbulent as waves. Newspapers and radio transmit and centralize news, enhance interest, and standardize tastes. Individual abilities certainly increase; the connection between people becomes closer. Therefore, individual freedom must not exceed reasonable boundaries. It is like walking freely in the wilderness, but not going far; driving carefully on the street, traveling hundreds of miles in a moment. Industrialization has accelerated the opening of closed areas and eliminated small countries. The Eskimos in the snowy lands of the Arctic can no longer hibernate, and bombers are flying in the sky. The natives under the coconut trees on the small islands of the South Seas can no longer sit still, and Bikini Island is practicing with atomic bombs. Slightly larger countries, such as Switzerland and Sweden, can no longer be outside the world's political situation. The actions of one country often affect the entire world.

The result of industrialization: One is the sufficiency of clothing and food, and enjoyment tends to be fair; the other is the complexity of transportation, and organization tends to be strict. The former develops economic equality, and the latter regulates political freedom. All ideals must be reasonable to exist. Since the beginning of mankind, democratic economics and politics have been the most sublime ideals. Due to industrialization, democratic ideals have gained the possibility and scope of realization.

### During a Reception for the Beijing Reporters' Delegation, Yan Xishan Made a Speech

Decides to Pursue Five Years of Self-Study After the Suppression of the Communists is Completed

[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan Dispatch] During the visit of the capital reporters' delegation to Bing (并), the host, Yan Xishan (閻錫山), engaged in two unrestricted and candid conversations with the reporters' delegation for about five hours each during the welcoming and farewell banquets, as well as before and after the banquets. Reporters were invited to accompany them, taking the opportunity to learn some interesting things.

During the evening meeting on the 16th, some colleagues asked if Mr. H.H. Kung (孔祥熙) had said that he had a lot of property in his ancestral home of Taigu (太谷), and whether his land had also been divided up in the same way as part of the implementation of the soldier-farmer integration. Bo Youcheng (薄右丞), who was in charge of the soldier-farmer integration, immediately replied that the parts he donated to schools and hospitals were handled according to the central government's regulations on public property for schools and hospitals, and all private property had been divided up. This was handled by the county cadres. The implementation of the soldier-farmer integration never considered the question of whose land should not be divided.

Another colleague pointed out that Shanxi has a considerable governance system, mainly the achievements of the soldier-farmer integration. If other counties across the country also want to implement it, can the Director participate in the next presidential election? Mr. Yan replied, "I have not considered the election issue. I plan to spend five years studying after the suppression of the Communists is completed. The government has entrusted me with 106 counties and cities to eliminate the Communist bandits and return them intact. Only then can I be worthy of the country and the people of Shanxi." The colleague said that the Director's plan to study for five years contradicts what the Director just said, that after taking public office, one should not read for oneself. Mr. Yan replied, "I am 66 years old this year. According to national regulations, I should have retired at 62. I feel that the harvest of life should have a pure and honorable result. I will spend these five years clearing up my own composition. This is the principle of nature, not studying while in office, but self-studying after retirement."

Another colleague mentioned that they learned in Fenyang (汾陽) that the people's dissatisfaction was not about the soldier-farmer integration itself, but about the unreasonable burden of the price difference in military grain purchases. Mr. Yan replied, "Although the people are dissatisfied with the military grain purchases when the soldier-farmer integration is implemented, they will definitely be able to get through it. If the soldier-farmer integration had not been implemented, it would not have been possible to seek such dissatisfaction. The Provincial Assembly told me that the unreasonable burden suffered by the people of Shanxi due to the price difference in military grain purchases amounted to 9 trillion yuan, which is almost one-seventh of the total amount of legal tender required by the country for the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the two years of suppressing the Communists. Speaking of the price difference in military grain purchases, the people already have an attitude of 'perish together with you.' This problem is most serious in Shanxi and Northeast China. It is said that the Northeast can already transport a large amount of grain by air, so Shanxi is the most difficult."

Another colleague pointed out that he heard that a famous doctor had examined the Director's body and said that the Director could live to 95 years old. Mr. Yan said: "According to the doctor's examination of my lungs, they are considered particularly strong. If only speaking of the lungs, I may be able to live to 150 years old, but I feel that because the lungs are good, they have damaged the large intestine. This is also a common effect, if one thing is bad, the whole body is bad. Since taking responsibility, I have been tidying up my posthumous writings every New Year's Day. This posthumous writing is divided into three parts: a posthumous presentation, a posthumous order, and a will."

The last colleague raised a rather interesting question. He said: "I heard that Mr. Yan's wife recently passed away. Is there a plan to marry a new wife?" As soon as these words came out, there was a burst of laughter. Mr. Yan kindly replied, "I have no intention of this." Our colleague continued, "Having a wife may be of great help." Mr. Yan replied, "I have not felt that there is a need for a woman's help. My household affairs are extremely simple, and I don't need anyone to take care of them." A long and informal conversation of five hours ended at about 11:00 PM, with everyone laughing all the way out of the General Headquarters. (Dispatch from Zhongshu on the 17th.)

### The Impact of Japanese Goods Sales in Hong Kong on Southern Migration Industry

--Hong Kong 20th Sea Courier --Our Newspaper Hong Kong Correspondent Zi Jian

According to the official announcement from the Hong Kong government, Hong Kong's trade with Japan last year had a total deficit of 5.34 million US dollars. Since the Tokyo Allied Headquarters allowed Japanese goods to be settled in gold pounds, the sales of Japanese goods in Hong Kong have increased sharply. In the first quarter of this year, Hong Kong's trade deficit with Japan has reached a huge 4.3 million US dollars. In addition to being directly shipped from Japanese ports to Hong Kong, Japanese goods are also shipped from Singapore with a change of labeling to disguise them as American goods. More than half of the so-called "Made in America" goods are actually Japanese goods. The Hong Kong government has increased the number of trading companies approved to engage in trade with Japan from more than a dozen to more than forty. Trading companies that used to purchase American goods have now changed course and are purchasing Japanese goods.

The result of the massive dumping of Japanese goods is that the light industry that flourished in Hong Kong and China after the war, especially the cotton weaving industry, is the first to suffer. In the past few months, 71 cotton weaving factories have been forced to close down, accounting for about one-tenth of the total. Other industries such as enamelware, electrical appliances, toys, and light metal manufacturing are also under severe threat from "cheap" Japanese goods. The Hong Kong Chinese Chamber of Commerce, seeing this, first sent a telegram to the British government protesting the policy of allowing Japanese goods to be sold in Hong Kong. Other economic figures in Hong Kong and China have also responded unanimously and have issued a "Declaration Against the Dumping of Japanese Goods."

The development of Hong Kong's industry is endangered by the dumping of Japanese goods. However, the Hong Kong government, which is responsible for promoting Hong Kong's prosperity, not only does not try to prevent the dumping of Japanese goods, but also sends commissioners to travel back and forth between Tokyo and Hong Kong to preside over trade with Japan. According to Hong Kong and Chinese economic observers, there are two important reasons for this: (1) The small industries established in Hong Kong after the war aim for huge profits, and the wages of workers are also beyond normal levels, resulting in surprisingly high prices, which are comparable to those of European and American goods. Now that they are facing competition from Japanese goods, they have to reduce profits and reduce costs to counter them. In this way, the public can buy relatively cheap daily necessities. (2) By replacing American goods with Japanese goods, merchants can purchase Japanese goods settled in pounds instead of American goods, which can reduce the Hong Kong government's consumption of US dollars, which is of great benefit to Hong Kong's finances. At the same time, the Hong Kong government reserves a place for London's exporters. In the future, when British products can be supplied to the Far East market in large quantities, British goods will replace Japanese goods and be dumped to mainland China in large quantities, using Hong Kong as a base (Japanese goods imported into Hong Kong are subject to the Hong Kong government's control).

The Hong Kong government publishes a monthly bulletin of factories that are registered and applying for registration. In April, 36 new factories were added in Hong Kong, bringing the total number of registered factories to 988. Among them, 253 are in Hong Kong and 735 are in Kowloon. In April, 39 new factories applied for registration with the Labour Department, including 7 metal manufacturing plants and weaving mills each, 2 enamel factories, yarn factories, and printing factories each. This is in stark contrast to the phenomenon of factories closing down due to the dumping of Japanese goods. What is the reason for this?

The answer to this question lies in the old story of domestic industry and mobile funds pouring into Hong Kong. The new factories that are springing up like mushrooms are the result of domestic funds in Hong Kong this year. When they were preparing to set up, they did not expect that Japanese goods would come so quickly and overwhelmingly. Now that Japanese goods have arrived, they have become arrows at the end of their flight. They cannot stop, so they have to bite the bullet and continue to do it. If possible, they should also roll up their sleeves and compete with Japanese goods.

Domestic funds should never have been invested in Hong Kong for the sake of temporary cheapness. Those "profit-only" merchants have now begun to "reap what they sow." In addition to feeling the pressure of Japanese goods, the newly established factories in Hong Kong are being dragged down by the high wages in Hong Kong and China and are now secretly complaining. Nanyang Yarn Factory recently caused a sensational labour dispute in Hong Kong due to the issue of workers' treatment. People in all circles find it a bit "unbelievable" that this "well-funded and large-scale" new yarn factory that moved south from Shanghai actually announced a strike less than a month after its official opening. This was also unexpected by those domestic capitalists who went south proudly.

A few days ago, according to information from reliable sources, several wealthy merchants from Shanghai could not find houses in Hong Kong and could not settle down. In a fit of anger, they angrily turned to Guangzhou. Is it really impossible for these wealthy merchants to find a place to settle down in Hong Kong? Not to mention the luxurious hotels or modern apartments in Hong Kong and China, even the mansions of their wealthy friends are enough for them to enjoy. However, they left without showing up. They are blessed. Let this "paradise" be "first come, first served" by those scoundrels.

Another "sin" of the southward movement of domestic funds to Hong Kong is that it turns the working capital for national construction into a dead piece of land wrapped in a foreign colony. In the past year, the price of land, whether in the most prosperous downtown area or the most secluded suburbs (which can be used as factory sites), has increased tenfold. This is entirely the result of the southward mobile funds competing to purchase it. In the six months after the Japanese army withdrew from Hong Kong, Hong Kong's real estate unanimously declined, and the Hong Kong government's "development plan" died. Now, with the southward mobile funds rushing to buy land, Hong Kong and China's mountain-moving and sea-filling projects have emerged. Remote bays, such as North Point in Hong Kong, Tokwawan, Ngau Chi Wan, and Cheung Sha Wan in Kowloon, have all been started to be filled into flat land for residential or factory areas. The newspaper often sees the grand plan of building a new Hong Kong. The iron hammer of the pile driver strikes the heart of the land time and time again, making some people on the Atlantic coast unable to help but revisit their beautiful old dreams for this small island that was originally intended to be "abandoned."

### Current Situation in Palestine Develops Sharpening Anglo-American Relations British Envoy to the US Meets Lovett US Demands Sanctions Be Imposed Under the UN Charter

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco 22nd Radio: Well-informed sources claim: US Secretary of State Lovett will discuss with the British whether sanctions can be imposed in the Middle East in accordance with Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.

[Reuters Washington 21st Dispatch] British Ambassador to Washington Balfour met with US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett for an hour today, making it increasingly believed that the Palestinian issue has worsened Anglo-American relations. It is rumored in Washington that President Truman will soon announce the lifting of the arms embargo on Israel, possibly after the Security Council rejects the US resolution declaring that the situation in Palestine has threatened peace. If this is the case, it will form a situation in which the United States supplies arms to Israel, while Britain provides military aid to Transjordan. At the same time, American newspapers' criticism of Britain's "participation" in the Arab war has also been increasing.

[Reuters London 21st Dispatch] People here are deeply concerned that the situation in Palestine will hinder relations between Britain and the United States. Britain will do its best within its capabilities to avoid a state of opposition between Britain and the United States in the Palestinian war.

[United Press New York 21st Dispatch] The Palestinian issue has begun to strain relations between Britain and the United States. Although it has not reached the point where the two countries have filed formal protests, if Britain continues to aid Arab countries in attacking the Jews in the Holy Land, the above-mentioned may occur. Privately, the United States and Britain have accused each other. The United States believes that Britain is observing the war in the Holy Land with a long-term view of its oil interests in the Middle East, disregarding Arab aggression and killing Jews. Britain believes that the United States is short-sighted because there are many Jews in the United States who can influence political issues. To this day, the rift between the United States and Britain has become more acute. The United States has recognized the State of Israel, but Britain has not recognized it. British spokesmen have said that they will not recognize the State of Israel for some time. If there is a showdown between Britain and the United States, President Truman seems to have the upper hand because the United States is paying money for the European Recovery Program, which is the greatest hope for Britain's economic recovery.

[Agence France-Presse Washington 21st Dispatch] According to reliable sources, Deputy Secretary of State Lovett met with British First Counselor Sir Balfour for 40 minutes today. It is said that they discussed the situation in Palestine. Sir Balfour tried to reconcile the opinions of Britain and the United States in the Security Council, but the State Department failed to make any decision. The same source also pointed out that British public opinion does not support the British government's attitude, and the US government's efforts to avoid aiding the State of Israel will put the United Nations in a stalemate.

[United Press Moscow 21st Dispatch] The Soviet government's official newspaper, Izvestia, criticized on the 21st that Britain deliberately hinders the solution of the Palestinian issue in order to strengthen its position among Arab countries. The newspaper also said that Britain should be responsible for the Palestinian issue and should now support the United Nations resolutions and assume this responsibility, and should not obstruct the solution of the problem.

[Reuters Washington 22nd Dispatch] Officials of the British Embassy denied that US news agencies reported that Britain had requested to hold a meeting with the United States to resolve the dispute between Britain and the United States over Palestine. This report was apparently a misrepresentation after British Ambassador to the US Balfour visited US Deputy Secretary of State Lovett yesterday to discuss the Palestinian issue. At the same time, American newspapers did not hesitate to speculate in great length about the possibility that Anglo-American relations would deteriorate due to Palestine. Related parties believe that Balfour's visit to Lovett was intended to avoid the major differences that would arise between Britain and the United States in the event that the United States lifted the arms embargo on the State of Israel while Britain continued to support the Transjordan army. Although these informal contacts are continuing, there is no suggestion that a formal meeting will be convened to facilitate this effort.

### Did Britain Use US Aid to Support Arab Armies? US Senate to Investigate Bevin Tells US Ambassador Anglo-Arab Relations Must Be Maintained

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London 22nd Radio: British Foreign Secretary Bevin spoke with US Ambassador Douglas today to discuss the differences between Britain and the United States on the Palestinian issue. According to diplomatic sources, the British side has informed the United States that Anglo-Arab relations must be maintained in order to prevent the southward flow of communism.

[United Press Washington 22nd Dispatch] Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Bridges said on the 22nd that if Congress finds that part of the European Recovery Fund is used to arm Arab armies, Congress may reduce the total amount that Britain should receive. He said that the Appropriations Committee will investigate the scope of British funding to Arab armies fighting the Jews.

If it is found that Britain has used US aid to fund Arab military operations, then Congress's reduction of Britain's share of $1.324 billion would be "very appropriate." The European Recovery Fund has been passed by Congress, but it must be approved by the Senate and House Appropriations Committees before it can be used. Senator Brewster told the Senate that Britain promised to provide King Abdullah of Transjordan with $8 million because of US economic assistance. Therefore, Bridges agreed to investigate, and many people in Congress also demanded the cancellation of the order to embargo arms to the Middle East.

[United Press London 22nd Dispatch] US Ambassador to Britain Douglas was summoned to visit the British Foreign Office on the 22nd and discussed the Palestinian issue with Foreign Secretary Bevin. Sources familiar with the matter said that the meeting took place because Washington announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee would investigate whether Britain would use the European Recovery Fund to fund Arab countries participating in the Palestinian war.

### Mayor of Jerusalem Takes Office

[United Press Philadelphia 21st Dispatch] Reverend Evans, the temporary mayor of Jerusalem appointed by the United Nations, will leave for his post on the 22nd to restore order in Jerusalem. Vera, one of the directors of the Friends Service Committee, will also accompany him.

### President of Israel to Meet Truman on Tuesday

[United States Information Service Washington 21st Dispatch] The White House announced today that Dr. Weizmann, the temporary president of the new Jewish State of Israel, will meet with President Truman on Tuesday. The White House said that Weizmann is expected to arrive in Washington from New York on Monday and discuss the situation in Palestine with Truman the next day.

### Chinese and Indian Muslim Groups Support Arab Clans

[United Press Nanjing 22nd Dispatch] The Chinese Islamic Association today telegraphed the Arab League in Cairo, promising to send 50 Chinese Muslims to support the Palestinian war. At the same time, the Arab League also telegraphed Jiang Tingfu, the head of the Chinese delegation to the United Nations, praising his impartial attitude towards the Palestinian issue.

[Reuters Karachi 21st Dispatch] Tens of thousands of Muslims from all over Karachi gathered in front of the US Embassy today to demonstrate, shouting slogans against the "US-Soviet-Jewish Axis." They also demanded the removal of the American flag. Fortunately, US Ambassador Erlin was calm and personally stepped onto the balcony to address the demonstrators in detail. Today was designated as "Palestine Day" by Muslims to show support for the Arab tribe to protest the US-Soviet support for Israel. All Muslim shops in the city were closed for one day.

### UN Mediator to Fly to the Holy Land on Thursday

[Reuters Stockholm 21st Dispatch] Count Bernadotte, President of the Swedish Red Cross, has expressed his willingness to serve as the UN Palestine Mediator. He told Reuters: "My acceptance of this task is because I believe that there is still a glimmer of hope for success. I know that the Palestinian issue is by no means an internal matter between the Jews and Arabs, but a spark that can lead to a major war. If there is a glimmer of hope for success, it is worth trying." He also said: Before accepting this position, he telegraphed UN Secretary-General Lie, asking about the status of the mediator, and stated that his attempt to take this position should not exceed six months. Lie replied to him on the afternoon of the 21st, informing him that he has considerable freedom to make suggestions and take actions. Bernadotte added that he will fly to Palestine next Thursday, and will retain the status of an official of the International Red Cross while in that area.

### Lebanon Detains American Jews US Protests Protest Letter Delivered to Arab Countries

[Reuters Washington 21st Dispatch] The State Department announced that the US government has ordered its representatives in various Arab countries to warn those governments not to discriminate against American citizens of Jewish descent. The US Ambassador to Lebanon protested to the Lebanese government yesterday over the fact that 40 American citizens were transferred from a US ship in Beirut to a detention center in Lebanon on Wednesday. He also stated that if these Americans are not restored to freedom, or any other Americans are arrested by the Lebanese authorities simply because they are of Jewish descent, the United States will bear the responsibility for protection. Copies of the protest letter have been delivered to the representatives of the United States in various Arab countries.

### US Air Force Expansion to 70 Group Case President Signs Into Law But States Reservation of Power to Use Additional Funds

[United Press Washington 21st Dispatch] President Truman today signed the $3.198 billion new aircraft purchase bill, but added a statement stating that he may not allow the use of the additional $822 million added by Congress to begin building a 70-group air force. Truman issued a statement stating that his signing of the bill does not mean that he is abandoning his current position that a 66-group air force is sufficient. Truman also said, "Congress has determined that in addition to the amount that I consider necessary, an additional $822 million should be added, but it is also stipulated that this amount cannot be used unless the President believes that "entering into a contract is necessary for national defense." The security of the United States requires an entire defense plan built on the foundation of a sound economic system and must be determined by the standard of expenses that can be afforded in the years to come. This is the reason why I am willing to implement the provisions of this bill." After the bill is signed by the President, the Department of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force will immediately order the first batch of new aircraft among the 4,200 new aircraft stipulated in the bill, most of which are jet aircraft.

### Israel Informs the Security Council that the Jewish Side Is Willing to Ceasefire Immediately; US Urges Intervention in Holy Land War, Resolution Yet to Be Voted On

[Our Newspaper's Report] London, 22nd Broadcast: Israel today notified the Security Council, stating that the Jewish side agrees to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. Another report: According to Jewish forces, the Arab forces' attack on the Old City of Jerusalem today was repelled.

[United Press, Lake Success, 22nd Dispatch] American sources claim that the United States may, on the 22nd, overcome British opposition and urge the United Nations to forcefully intervene in the Palestine war. They expect the United Nations Security Council to pass the American proposal, ordering a halt to the bloodshed in the Holy Land, by a necessary majority of seven votes.

If so, Britain will also not use its veto power to obstruct the majority decision. The Security Council convened a special meeting on Saturday, hoping to pass a resolution to halt or at least alleviate the war between the Jews and Arabs. However, the decision on whether to pass the American proposal remains unresolved. Previously, the United States had almost given up hope of passing its proposal, but Canada, Colombia, and Belgium suddenly expressed their agreement to take consistent action with the United States. With Soviet support, Nicaragua is urging the Security Council to take a firm stance, not hesitating to use economic sanctions or even force to stop the war. Britain, with the support of China and possibly two other countries, hopes to avoid overly decisive action and instead pass a ceasefire request, not intending to punish any side that resists.

[United Press, Lake Success, 21st Dispatch] Soviet representative Andrei Gromyko today requested the United Nations Security Council to pass the American proposal and take strong action to stop the war in Palestine, without further delay. However, the Security Council then discussed the issue of the Czech Communist coup at the afternoon meeting, and it is still unknown when the Holy Land case will be put to a vote. Gromyko criticized the British proposed peace mediation plan as insufficient, stating that Britain is now openly assisting Transjordan, whose King Abdullah, with British support, has become a modern Caesar in the Middle East. At the same time, Syrian representative Faris al-Khouri declared that the American original proposal advocates ordering the Arabs to cease fire without protecting Palestine or implementing partition, a point that the Arab side finds difficult to accept. The Arabs will continue to oppose partition and the so-called Jewish and Arab states.

### New Gold Mine Discovered in Northern Australian Desert

[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd Dispatch] The "Daily Mail" here today reported that since the secret gold mine exploitation in northern Australia in the early part of this century, the richest gold mine has recently been discovered in that area. The newspaper stated that the gold mine's vein was discovered in the desert by a person named Harris and his wife Claire. They have transferred the mining rights to a company formed by Melbourne financiers and named Claire Mrs. Pty. Ltd. for a price of £25,000 and 25,000 shares in the company.

### West German Political Structure Issues; Three Countries Reach Preliminary Agreement; Financial Reform Expected This Summer

[Reuters, London, 21st Dispatch] The conference of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, and the six Benelux countries to discuss the German issue held a plenary meeting on the 21st, without publishing a communique afterward. However, observers believe that the convening of this last plenary meeting indicates that some basic agreements have been reached on the two issues of international control of the Ruhr and the organization of the West German constitutional assembly.

[United Press, London, 21st Dispatch] Foreign affairs officials said today that the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg have reached a preliminary agreement on the issue of establishing a West German provisional government, and that it will be formally announced early next week once the details are agreed upon. The six countries decided to convene the West German constitutional assembly around September 1 to draft the West German constitution. The three occupying powers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France retain veto power over export trade, currency, and diplomatic policies.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 21st Dispatch] An official spokesperson claimed that the British and American authorities in Germany will soon implement financial reform directly, without going through the four-power agreement. A spokesperson for the German affairs department said that this reform will be implemented in the summer or autumn, at which time the existing banknotes will be withdrawn and replaced with new banknotes. In addition to this reform, a capital surcharge will also be implemented intermittently. The spokesperson also stated that this reform will strengthen the currency system of the joint occupation zones.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 21st Dispatch] The governments of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States have completely agreed to simultaneously implement financial reform in the three occupation zones of West Germany, and the date of its implementation has not been revealed. According to responsible opinions, it will not be implemented before this summer, and the issue of expanding the reform to the Berlin area occupied by the three Western European countries has not been resolved. The negotiations on German financial reform began months ago, with the Soviet Union initially participating but later withdrawing.

### Truman Asks Congress to Establish Alaska as a State

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st Dispatch] President Truman sent a message to Congress, re-applying to change Alaska into a state, and pointed out that Alaska has abundant resources that can be developed and contribute to the country's economy. If this becomes a reality, it will be the fiftieth state of the United States.

### Arab Forces Have Seized Jerusalem; 100,000 Trapped Jews Have Run Out of Food and Water; US Consul General Wasson Wounded by Gunfire

[Our Newspaper's Report] London, 22nd Broadcast: The US State Department has just announced that US Consul General Wasson was wounded in Jerusalem today. Wasson met with the French consul and others today to discuss the ceasefire issue. On his return to the US consulate general, he was suddenly injured by machine gun fire.

[Reuters, Geneva, 21st Dispatch] The International Red Cross has sent telegrams to the governments of six countries: Egypt, Iraq, Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and the government of the State of Israel, requesting them to respect the safety zones within the city of Jerusalem in order to protect the safety of non-combatants.

[Reuters, London, 22nd Dispatch] The Arab side claims that the Arab Legion has almost taken control of the entire Jerusalem. The Israeli public announcement from Tel Aviv admits that the Jewish forces inside and outside Jerusalem are in a serious situation. The Arab Legion's artillery fire is particularly fierce, and all strategic points in the Jerusalem area still occupied by Jewish forces are the targets of their bombing. At the same time, the Egyptian army is advancing rapidly and has reached a point four miles south of Jerusalem, where it will be able to join forces with the Arab Legion. The 100,000 Jews in the Jerusalem area have run out of food and water, and their morale is plummeting.

[Reuters, London, 21st Dispatch] The war in Palestine has entered its sixth day. Based on reports from both the Jewish and Arab sides and neutral sources, the latest war situation is as follows: Southern Front Egyptian Army: The Egyptian army's attack on the Yatir Motke Jewish area, ten miles north of Gaza, was repelled by the Jewish forces. Egyptian artillery also bombed Deir al-Balah, near the Egyptian army's front-line command post north of Gaza. Eastern Route: The Egyptian army, after occupying Beersheba, has not been reported to have made significant progress. Transjordan's public announcement repeated: The Potash factory north of the Dead Sea and the nearby Jewish areas did not heed the Transjordan Legion's warnings to surrender and instead set themselves on fire. Therefore, the Transjordan army has occupied these areas. Northeastern Front along the Jordan River: Aircraft from Transjordan, Iraq, and Syria have been deployed to cover the operation and attack the Jewish front lines. The Israeli Air Force, after its first deployment in the Galilee theater on the 20th, was not active on the 21st.

### Before South Korea Has Security Forces, US Troops Do Not Intend to Withdraw; South Korea's New National Assembly to Convene This Month

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 22nd Dispatch] South Korea has now begun organizing an international security force and has begun expanding recruitment in various places. Koreans between the ages of 18 and 25 are eligible to respond to the recruitment. This international security force is prepared to assume the defense work of the country when US troops withdraw from South Korea.

[United Press, Washington, 21st Dispatch] US government officials said on the 21st that if the new Korean government requests the United States after the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea, a "large number" of US military, economic, and political advisors still intend to remain in South Korea. They stated that some of these advisors are US government officials, and some are American civilians hired by the Korean government.

At the same time, US officials emphasized that although the United States has decided to withdraw army dependents from South Korea, there is no definite plan for the withdrawal of US occupation forces. The withdrawal plan depends on several factors: First, how long will it take for the Koreans to enable the new government to function and establish appropriate security forces? Second, what recommendations will the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea make? Third, the general trend of the international situation. Officials here hope that the Korean government will be able to function before August 1. At the same time, State Department officials estimate that the number of US diplomatic personnel stationed in Seoul after the establishment of the new government will be between thirty and fifty people, but they also stated that there are other Americans stationed in Seoul. It is expected that the Korean government will request the US military advisory group to assist in the development of security forces.

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 22nd Dispatch] US military governor of South Korea, Major General Hodge, said when answering reporters' questions during an interview yesterday that the issue of when the new South Korean National Assembly will convene is currently under discussion and will be approximately before the 23rd of this month.

### North Korea's Power Outage Issue; US Urges Negotiations

Hodge Writes to the Soviet Military Commander

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 22nd Dispatch] It was learned here today that the US military commander in South Korea, Hodge, has lodged a serious protest with the Soviet military commander in North Korea, Korotkov, regarding the issue of North Korea stopping the supply of electricity to South Korea and has suggested convening a US-Soviet meeting to negotiate the basic conditions for restoring the supply of electricity.

[United Press, Seoul, 21st Dispatch] US military commander in South Korea, Hodge, today published a letter to the Soviet military commander in North Korea, Korotkov, stating that there are sixty cars of goods, currently valued at more than two million US dollars, prepared to be delivered to North Korea to pay for electricity, but the immediate restoration of the current is a prerequisite for the delivery of goods and payment, or for negotiating future payment methods. Although this power outage was implemented by the North Korean People's Committee, Hodge believes that Korotkov should be responsible, and this move is obviously a political action to punish South Korea for the May 10 election. The goods to be delivered by South Korea include electrical equipment that the US occupation zone lacks. If North Korea does not want them, the people of South Korea are very willing to have them.

### US Closely Monitors Indian Communist Party's Activities

[United Press, Washington, 22nd Dispatch] Well-informed sources have recently stated that US officials are convinced that the Indian Communist Party has abandoned the hope of "burrowing from within" and seizing power in the government and has instead tried to do its best to arrange the foundation for a "people's revolution." It is reported that the US government has always paid close attention to the activities of the Indian Communist Party and is increasingly interested in communist activities within the Hyderabad princely state. To date, the Hyderabad state has refused to join the Indian Dominion. Washington has received reports from diplomatic sources that the activities of the Indian Communist Party are extremely active and that government announcements and press reports are not enough to fully detail them.

According to reports, the Indian industrial community is disturbed by the Indian Communist Party, and the Communist Party is also inciting farmers.

### US Republican Primaries; Taft and Stassen Are Neck and Neck

[United Press, Portland, Oregon, 22nd Dispatch] In the Oregon Republican presidential nomination primary, in 1,047 districts out of the state's 1,861 districts, unofficial vote counting results show that Dewey received 50,675 votes, while Stassen received 44,374 votes. Dewey's strength in the agricultural areas, which are generally considered to be Stassen's strongholds, is surprising and may lead to victory.

[United Press, Pennsylvania, 21st Dispatch] According to official statistics of the Pennsylvania Republican vote, Stassen received 4,254 more votes than Dewey. The number of votes received by each person is as follows: Stassen 81,251 votes, Dewey 76,988 votes, MacArthur 18,254 votes, Taft 15,166 votes, Vandenberg 8,818 votes, Eisenhower 4,726 votes, Wallace 1,432 votes.

### Soviet Union Repatriates 1.5 Million German Prisoners of War

[United Press, Berlin, 21st Dispatch] A newspaper sponsored by the Soviet Union stated today that the Soviet Union has repatriated 1.5 million German prisoners of war to their home country. The number of German prisoners of war still remaining in the Soviet Union was not mentioned.

### Michael of Romania to Marry Anne in Athens

[Reuters, Athens, 21st Dispatch] Reliable sources revealed that former King Michael of Romania and Princess Anne of Denmark will soon hold their wedding in Athens. Michael will arrive in Athens from the United States on June 2 to visit his uncle. Queen Helena, the mother of the Greek King Paul, will come together. Princess Anne will also arrive in Athens at the same time. Michael is 26 years old and the princess is 25 years old. Michael is a Greek Orthodox Christian, while the princess is a Catholic. With special permission from the Pope, the wedding will be held according to Orthodox rites.

Employees of the Japanese National Railways began a slowdown on the 21st.

The US Alien Property Administration announced that diamonds worth 50 million stolen by the Nazis from the Netherlands have been seized and will be returned to the Netherlands.

### Strong Opposition in the UK to the US Policy of Supporting Japan; Particularly Concerned About Raising Japan's Industrial Level

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd Dispatch] Regarding the issue of Japanese reparations, since the report submitted by US Assistant Secretary of State Clayton, opposition has been quite high. In the Far Eastern Commission, the British representative also expressed opposition to this proposal from the US side. The British representative's opinion is that although the reparations issue is not solely aimed at limiting Japan's industrial level, the attitude of maintaining Japan's industrial level to exceed self-sufficiency cannot be tolerated. The British representative stated that in the Far Eastern Commission, the Japanese industrial level should be decided according to the opinions of the majority of countries, and the Japanese reparations issue should be decided by the Japanese industrial level.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd Dispatch] The World Trade Association predicts that Japan will be the third-ranked country in the world in terms of cotton and iron exports. However, given the recent international opposition to the US policy of supporting Japan, it is questionable whether Japan's foreign trade will proceed according to the US plan in the future.

### Jianghai Customs Bribery Case; Bribing Merchants Convicted; Ye Zonglin Sentenced to Three Years; Mao Runxiang Declared Not Guilty and Granted Bail; Shao Jiazhen and Five Others to Be Dealt With Separately After Arrest

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd Dispatch] Bribing merchants in the sensational Shanghai Jianghai Customs major bribery case were sentenced on the 22nd by the Capital District Court. At around 5:00 PM, Court President Ouyang Shu of the District Court Criminal Division 1, Judge Ren Zhiwu, Zhao Ruji, Prosecutor Tian Jihou, and Clerk Wang Shuo appeared in court, bringing the defendants Ye Zonglin and Mao Runxiang to court. The judgment was read out, stating: "Ye Zonglin is sentenced to three years of imprisonment for paying bribes to public officials for acts that violate their duties, and is also fined three million yuan. He is to be deprived of public rights for three years. If he is unable to pay the fine, he is allowed to commute each day of the fine for one day of labor. Mao Runxiang is not guilty." The judgment first described the fact that when Ye Zonglin was the manager of Shanghai Tianhe and Dakang dye companies, before the two companies were established in the summer of 1946, he borrowed the name of Jiafu company, which was not registered with the transportation management committee, to pay a bribe of 100 million yuan to customs officials in order to prematurely and fraudulently import pigments purchased in the United States. After confirmation of the statements of various related personnel, "It is beyond doubt that the defendant paid bribes to public officials for acts that violate their duties. His actions are particularly heinous, and he is sentenced to three years of imprisonment, fined three million yuan, and deprived of public rights for three years." "As for the part of Mao Runxiang's accusation of bribery, there is no proof," "Since the defendant did not assist in fraud, he should be declared not guilty. Shao Jiazhen, Qiu Ziming, Shao Shuping, Shi Yiping, and Feng Yongnian will be dealt with separately after their arrest." Finally, the presiding judge ruled that Mao Runxiang was allowed bail after submitting a written security deposit of 200 million yuan and having a reliable store in Beijing provide a guarantee. The court was then adjourned.

### Direct Rule Road Breaks Up Gold and Dollar Speculation Organization; Also Engages in Illegal Off-Exchange Securities Trading; Evidence Seized, Deputy Manager Detained for Questioning

[Shanghai News] The Economic Group of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters reported that a large-scale black market gold and dollar speculation organization was operating at No. 22 Zhili Road in this city. After receiving the report, the group immediately went to the address for a secret investigation yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, led by Group Leader Chen Mo and officers Sheng Xilin, Zhang Linqiang, Chen Mingyao, Tao Yaoguo, etc. They found on the upper floor of the address a large-scale organization that falsely established the Hetaixi Pharmaceutical Company and illegally specialized in black market gold and dollar transactions.

### Foreign Electrical Staff's Dissatisfaction with Index Discount, City Government States Three Points

The 100 Western staff members (totaling 17 nationalities) of the American-owned Shanghai Power Company, who were hired locally, recently expressed their dissatisfaction with the calculation method for their compensation as approved by the Municipal Government's Cost of Living Index Application Committee (which discounts salaries above 250 yuan). In the name of their association, they appealed in various Western newspapers in the city, stating the impropriety of the city government's restrictions on their salaries. It is said that they will petition the consuls of 13 countries to negotiate with the municipal authorities, demanding that the cost of living index for Western expatriates be calculated in full. A reporter from Dagon Society specifically visited a relevant official of the municipal government yesterday to inquire about their opinion. According to the official: (1) They are locally hired staff, not specialized personnel hired from abroad to work in China. Therefore, the company's treatment of them is the same as that of Chinese employees, and there is nothing special about it. (2) Luxurious parts of the cost of living should be discounted. (3) The treatment of employees of Chinese-owned public utility companies is actually very different compared to theirs.

### Wu Decai Beaten to Death Case, Five Workers Each Sentenced to Ten Years

[Our Report] The District Court yesterday announced the verdict in the case of Liu Qinghua, a worker at the Fourth Wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, who was accused of assault leading to death. Liu Qinghua, Wu Yuanshun, Peng Baoan, Yang Kaiyong, and Peng Yongqing were each sentenced to ten years in prison and deprived of their civil rights for two years. The rest were acquitted.

At Tilam Bridge Chinese Hospital, a young man who had taken poison was rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment in the early hours of yesterday morning, but he died due to the severity of the poisoning. It is reported that the young man was named Dun Shunkang, 22 years old, from Ningbo, and lived at 572 Maohai Road (i.e., Haimen Road) in Hongkou. He was a paint broker. He recently got engaged to a Miss Wang from Suzhou. Because it was a free love marriage, the two were deeply in love. On the day of the engagement, Guo bought a gold bracelet for her to wear. Guo Shunkang's mother, Guo Zhang, showed displeasure at her son's marriage to Miss Wang and the purchase of gold bracelets and other jewelry for her. Recently, Miss Wang came to Shanghai from Suzhou, and Guo accompanied her on outings, which further displeased his mother. So she used the excuse that a female relative of hers needed to borrow the gold bracelet temporarily to wear to a wedding banquet, promising to return it in three days. However, after Zhang obtained the gold bracelet, she refused to return it. Her son, Guo Shunkang, argued with his mother on behalf of his wife, and a dispute arose between the mother and son. Guo became angry and took poison late the other night. By the time it was discovered and he was sent to the Chinese Hospital, it was too late to save him. The body has been sent to the coroner's office for an autopsy.

### Two Young American Men and Women Arrive in Shanghai After Travelling from the Communist Area, Having Served at the International Peace Hospital for Over a Year, Lack of Medicine, Even Mud Becomes a Substitute

[United Press, This City, 22nd] Two young American men and women, who stayed in the communist area for fourteen months, have now arrived in Shanghai after trekking over two thousand miles from northern Shaanxi. The woman's name is Gwendolen, a nurse, and the man's name is Miles, a medical worker. They arrived in Yan'an together in March of last year. Two weeks later, they followed the communist army in its retreat and served in the "International Peace Hospital" established with foreign donations. The two traveled by foot and mule cart for about ten weeks before reaching the Nationalist area south of Tianjin, and then transferred to Shanghai. It is said that the CCP's opposition to American aid to China is still strong, and Wallace's speech is prominently featured in the newspapers. However, individual Americans are treated quite favorably, and their movements are not restricted. Medical personnel still in the communist area include the British couple Mr. and Mrs. Hsi, and the New Zealander Cliffored, all of whom are safe and sound. The hospital where the two served was one of the two hospitals withdrawn from Yan'an, located in Xiabaita. For convenience and safety, the entire hospital was divided into four groups. The patients were mostly wounded soldiers. However, there was a lack of penicillin, sulfa drugs, and plaster. The hospital's equipment was very simple. The operating room was a whitewashed cave, the windows were made of transparent sorghum stalks, and the operating table was made of two wooden boxes. Most of the operations were performed during the day to save oil. At night, only vegetable oil or kerosene lamps were used for lighting. Surgical supplies were also often replaced with other materials, such as using sesame oil instead of petroleum jelly, dried soil instead of talcum powder, and making DDT mixtures easily. The food for the local farmers was still sufficient. The most rampant diseases were typhus, relapsing fever, and tuberculosis. Soldiers mostly suffered head, arm, and leg injuries, and many operations had to be performed every week. Ms. Stanley plans to return to the United States in June, and Miles will stay in Shanghai.

### Theatres Seek Protection, Authorities Striving to Prevent, War Veterans Moved to Suburbs, Seeking Early Departure, Suggesting Central Government Temporarily Refrain from Sending More

[Our Report] Recently, several theatres in the city have been harassed by armed men, such as destroying premises and beating employees, which has been happening frequently. All the theatres in the city jointly appealed to the authorities the other day, requesting that they be given real protection. A reporter visited the person in charge of security yesterday and asked if there were any effective measures to stop this trend. According to him: the recent incidents of soldiers harassing theatres were mostly caused by war veterans in transit. They had been on the battlefield for a long time and were disabled while fighting for the country. Now they are being sent back to their hometowns, and when they pass through the city, they see the extravagance of the city and are refused entry to the theatre. As a result, they are frustrated and take extreme action. While this is inappropriate in terms of military discipline, it is understandable in terms of reason and emotion. Now, in order to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, in addition to contacting the transit troops in advance to arrange for designated entertainment venues for the transit soldiers to watch plays, the 800 war veterans who recently came to Shanghai have been moved to the suburbs near Longhua and their officers have been instructed to strictly restrain them and seek early departure. The division headquarters has also sent an urgent telegram to the central government requesting that they temporarily refrain from sending more war veterans before this batch of war veterans leaves Shanghai. At the same time, they actively suggested to the authorities that all future shipments of soldiers should not use Shanghai as a transfer point in order to avoid stimulating the soldiers' psychology and causing disputes. It is heard that the central government is considering this and may adopt it. As for the entertainment of local troops and wounded soldiers, it has been agreed that each theatre will take turns hosting them, and soldiers can watch a play once a week. Logically, there should be no additional radical actions. Otherwise, they will be severely punished.

### Stamp Exhibition, Visitors Shoulder to Shoulder

[Our Report] The stamp exhibition sponsored by the Directorate General of Posts of the Ministry of Communications has been open for four days, and visitors are shoulder to shoulder and constantly flowing in. The crowding is unprecedented in the history of various exhibitions at the China Art Garden. Some philatelists have traveled from afar by boat, train, and plane to visit, while others have brought dry food and are studying and extracting information at the venue from morning to evening. Every day when the doors are closed, there are still a large number of visitors lingering and reluctant to leave. They must wait for the venue staff to repeatedly urge and persuade them before they leave. If the crowding situation does not subside by the closing date of the 25th, the Post Office and the Xinguang Stamp Association will consider extending the exhibition period.

### Assaulted, Detained, Found to Have Committed Theft

[Our Report] The gangster Liu Xuan, also known as Xiaoliuzi, lives at 34 Jifuli, Changyang Road, and has potential influence in the area. On the 9th of this month, Liu had a fight with his neighbor Chen Zhaolin at 6 Chuan Road. After being arrested by the Yulin Road Police Branch, he was imprisoned for seven days to deter his enemies for assaulting others. Subsequently, Zhu Jingen, a resident of 1182 Tonglu Road, heard the news and went to the station to accuse Liu of being a thief, saying that Liu came to his shop on February 22nd to buy a silver bracelet, valued at 240,000 yuan. As a result, Liu only paid 200,000 yuan, and the remaining 40,000 yuan was never returned. A few days later, when Liu passed by my door, my wife asked him to pay the 40,000 yuan. Not only did he not pay, but he also claimed, "I'll show you what's what in three days." On the afternoon of the 24th, at about 2 pm, six gangsters came and robbed them of 300 taels of silver, four gold rings, and 10 million yuan in cash. When they were robbing, Liu asked my wife for the key for a long time, so I clearly remembered his appearance. In addition, Liu's wife, Jing Hongbin, a resident of 1062 Xuchang Road, also went to the station to accuse Liu of robbing their home on April 19th, and stealing 11 small gold belts, four gold rings, and one gold bracelet. It has now been confirmed by investigation that he will be transferred to the Special Criminal Court on charges of robbery.

### "Sending Son Guanyin" Grand Gathering, Congratulating the Midwives Association's Third Congress

— Lichun

In this city, there are more than 1,500 midwives who are regarded as Sending Son Guanyin. Under the leadership of the chairman, Ms. Xie Neng, they already had a strong organization two years ago—the Shanghai Midwives Association—and the association's work has made significant achievements. The qualifications of each member have been strictly reviewed. Not only must they have a diploma from a midwifery school, but they must also have a midwife certificate from the Ministry of Health. Most of these thousand-odd members, the younger ones, work in public and private medical institutions, and the older ones mostly practice on their own, distributed in every corner of the city, busy day and night for the safety of women and infants. The birth of hundreds of babies in this city every day can grow up entirely thanks to their hard work. They are not only the saviors of pregnant women, but also the nannies of the nation.

They all have a passion for service and professional confidence. Regardless of the severe cold or scorching heat, day and night, they must immediately go to perform the task of ensuring the safety of mothers and children upon the call of pregnant women—delivery. Sometimes they lose sleep at night to deliver babies, but during the day they must be responsible for prenatal and postnatal examinations of pregnant women, infant vaccinations, and other work. There are few opportunities to take a moment to rest. Therefore, their health is often affected by their irregular lives. As for entertainment, there is no opportunity. Midwifery is nominally a freelance profession, but it is actually a very unfree profession. They sacrifice their own freedom for the sake of women and infants, and in exchange for the safety of women and infants.

Their great spirit is truly admirable. Although the government does not treat them with courtesy, the low treatment of public medical institutions is not enough to maintain personal life, but they only bury their heads in hard work and never make any requests to their superiors, because they only want to dedicate what they have learned to society, and Hua Sheng exhausts their energy for women and infants, and they have a lofty position in society.

Today is the day of the third member conference of the Midwives Association. I would like to express my high expectations, hoping that the government will provide special assistance to the Midwives Association so that it can establish a stronger foundation, and I hope that Chairman Xie will lead all members with the same perseverance as in the past to save the suffering women and infants in our city and ascend to the other shore together.

### The Public Opinion Survey Committee Raises Prices, Rice Breaks Through Six Million Yesterday, Flour and Oil Rise in Unison

Because the price of rice was lower than the price at the production site, the price in Wuxi rose sharply the day before. In addition, the Public Opinion Survey Committee also raised the price of rice. The price of rice sold by the Nanshi district was divided into four types, with the highest being 5.95 million and the lowest being 5.8 million, for a total of 2,138 shi sold. The prices in the Beishi district were divided into two types, 5.7 million and 5.9 million, with an average increase of 400,000. The former was sub-white, and the latter was late rice, for a total of 605 shi sold, which caused people's hearts to become more anxious. The cargo owners tried their best to raise prices, and special japonica reached 6.3 million yuan, while early rice and other varieties all reached over 6 million, a sharp increase of 300,000 to 350,000. The total amount of goods arriving in the North and South markets was 72.29 million.

The rise in flour prices is becoming increasingly fierce. Yesterday, riding on the rise in rice prices, people's hearts were even more firm. In addition, the price of flour sold by the China Trust Bureau increased by 150,000 yuan, reaching 1.95 million yuan delivered, and limited each household to 50 bags. Under the support of the cargo owners, the rise was like a wild horse galloping.

Red Bee and Jiancheng closed at 2.12 million each, an increase of 150,000 to 160,000 each. The price of bran rose by 120,000. Wheat cargo owners were holding on to prices, and no agreement was reached, so there were no transactions.

Broad bean oil initially opened at 14.9 million, and then reached 15.1 million, an increase of 1.1 million. A good barrel of raw oil reached 17 million, an increase of 1.5 million.

### Cotton Yarn Control Committee Allocates Yarn: Resolution of the Unified Tax Issue, Deducting from Yarn Price First

[Report from this newspaper] The Cotton Yarn Control Committee previously submitted two proposals to the Central Bank regarding the issue of the cotton yarn unified tax of the Executive Yuan: (1) The storage rent and insurance costs before the end of May this year are to be borne by the yarn factory. (2) The date of the storage receipt at the time of the contract is to be extended by 40 days (the 20 days extended due to the cotton issue have been included) as the deadline for calculating the unified tax period. The unified tax before this deadline is to be borne by the yarn factory, and the increased unified tax after this deadline is to be borne by the Central Bank. It has now been learned that the Central Bank has agreed to the second proposal, but the first proposal is to ask the Cotton Yarn Control Committee to negotiate directly with the yarn factory and consider extending the deadline appropriately.

After the resolution of the above tax burden issue, the Cotton Yarn Control Committee has decided that starting tomorrow (the 24th), for the Executive Yuan cotton yarn allocated by the China Textile Corporation on behalf of the committee, the portion of the unified tax that should be borne by the government will be deducted from the yarn price first, and the customer will directly pay it to the factory after obtaining the allocation. In the future, customers will not have any further delays in picking up yarn.

Yarn Prices Rise Again

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was invigorated due to the easing of credit among fellow businesses, and buyers from Tianjin, Austria, and other regions were more eager. The 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn jumped by 7 million yuan as soon as the agricultural bank opened. As soon as the market opened, the China Textile Corporation announced a sealed bid sale, and the market sentiment softened immediately, with prices falling to a low of 288 million. Later, many replica makers took advantage of small lots to absorb yarn, and the market rebounded. Near closing, it rose to the 300 million yuan mark, an increase of 18 million yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn also generally rose by 4 million to 5 million to 16 million to 17 million due to strong demand from both local customers and retail buyers.

Cotton Cloth Hovering

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was characterized by sluggish buying and selling, and fellow businesses generally adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Dyeing factories also absorbed little, and only the broad market and retail buyers did some intermittent trading. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth initially rose by 40,000 to 50,000 after opening, and finally closed at 6.83 million yuan, an increase of only 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of other cloths were still relatively stable. It is also reported that the China Textile Corporation supplied and sold cloth, three kinds of bed sheets, and fine cloth with a Blue Peacock listed price of 6.44 million yuan, with an additional 100,000 yuan for the purchase order. Finally, the price of Longtou fine cloth rose to 7 million yuan, and there were sales of goods on Monday.

### Sales of Woolen Fabrics are Brisk

Although woolen fabrics have turned from rising to stable, and from stable to weak, sellers are still holding onto high prices, while buyers are looking for prices to fall.

### Wenzhou Lu Zhuang Fine Eyebrow Tea will be Launched Soon

Although the negotiations on domestic sales of tea yesterday were not hidden, the two sides maintained their own attitudes, resulting in less active trading than the previous day. In this situation, the trend was undulating and narrow, still presenting a consolidating pattern. However, the specialty product from the bottom of the empty tiger in the 36th year finally took the lead, and at the close, each was increased by 5 million yuan. As for the foreign-owned tea market, exporters' buying interest still invaded the market, but they still used their sharp blades to slash prices. However, because of cost considerations, they continued to be reluctant to part with their goods, resulting in a situation that remained as calm as before. According to fellow traders, the Wenzhou Fine Eyebrow tea of Lu Zhuang this year has been inspected by the Xia Chang Tea Company, and it is expected to be launched soon.

The agency fee opened high at 37 yuan and 41 yuan, and although it was stable after entering, it was still volatile. It rose to 2,995 yuan.

### Although There Were Differences in Advances, Bank Credit Still Appeared Loose

[Report from China United News Agency] Bank credit in Shanghai was loose again yesterday. Although the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury still had differences in advances, they only amounted to 466.1 billion. The market sentiment was therefore more invigorated, and the dark interest rate also gradually fell to around three corners. However, according to the Financial Administration Bureau, the authorities will continue to tighten credit. If necessary, they will not relax until the situation is unprecedentedly tight. Among the differences in advances of the banks and bureaus yesterday, the Central Bank had an advance of 216.81 billion, the Bank of China had an advance of 63.9 billion, the Bank of Communications had a difference of 221.6 billion, the Farmers Bank had an advance of 31.6 billion, the Post Office Savings Bureau had an advance of 6.96 billion, the Postal Savings Bureau had an advance of 4.84 billion, and the Central Cooperative Treasury had an advance of 200 million.

### The Tung Oil and Pig Bristle Market is Firm, the Bristle Industry Crisis is Urgent and Should Encourage Increased Production

The China Trust Bureau recently released the tung oil and pig bristle market conditions for the past week as follows: The overseas tung oil market continued to be firm this week. New York spot prices were US$0.25 per pound, equivalent to US$0.24 C&F, with many transactions. Paint factories' inventories are gradually depleted and are eager to buy. The futures market for June, July, and August is quite active. Hong Kong oil prices are reasonable, only HK$145.50 per sima dan, so London prices are low. Barrelled oil is £179 per long ton CIF. Domestic market prices are Chongqing 11,200,000,000 yuan per city zu, Wanxian 12,000,000,000 yuan, Hankou 13,700,000,000 yuan, Shanghai 15,000,000,000 yuan, Guangzhou 15,900,000,000 yuan, and Wuzhou 16,000,000,000 yuan. The overseas pig bristle market was firm this week, but China's supply was scarce. Foreign importers and brush factories initially thought that China's foreign exchange policy would change soon. After the change, China's stockpiles would be shipped to the US in large quantities. The selling price of pig bristles in the US could be reduced, and they have not dared to import in large quantities for several months, only seeking to meet their needs. Now they have discovered that the number of supplies in our country has decreased, and the foreign exchange control methods are difficult to change, so they are eager to replenish. However, due to the exchange rate, the Sichuan ports cannot cover costs. Bristle factories only seek to preserve mature goods to maintain the value of the currency. They are not interested in acquiring raw materials and increasing production. This is a major crisis in the pig bristle industry, and it is extremely important to the foreign exchange income. It is urgently necessary to encourage increased production to prevent foreign brush factories from using substitutes due to the interruption of raw materials. On the other hand, the high overseas selling price of pig bristles is also not a good phenomenon. In order to maintain the sales of pig bristles, it is necessary to prevent substitutes from invading. The current overseas market prices are Chongqing No. 27 black mixed bristles C&F New York at US$2.65 per pound, Hankou No. 17 black mixed bristles at US$3.8, Shanghai No. 17 black mixed bristles at US$2.35, Tianjin Da Wu 55 box black mixed bristles at 9 yuan, and Xiao Wu 55 black mixed bristles at US$5.9, all of which are quite high.

### Domestic Exchange Rate Correction

The domestic exchange rates of the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury will be corrected starting from the 24th as follows: Xiamen 230 yuan, Quanzhou 130 yuan, Shantou 150 yuan, Haikou 12 yuan, Changsha 40 yuan, Hengyang 50 yuan, Lianyungang 20 yuan, Xinpu 20 yuan, Xuzhou 10 yuan, Jingdezhen 40 yuan, Shikoan 30 yuan, Ganzhou 40 yuan, Wenzhou 50 yuan, Xufu and Wanxian 60 yuan each, and Guizhou 30 yuan.

Business Briefs: The market for daily necessities and soap is being held up by cargo owners, but most transactions are just playing around. Huang Xiangmao is doing better, and prices have risen significantly by 120,000. Guben has risen by 160,000, and Jian Dao has risen by 100,000. Guanghua and Meili are also trading smoothly, and prices are also firm.

The kerosene industry is doing well with mutual transactions. High-grade barreled goods are selling for 22 million yuan, and listens are rising to 2.6 million yuan, with retail at 56,000 yuan. In addition, the prices of matches and candles are also stable.

### The US Government Will Control Exports and Implement Fair Distribution of Materials

In order to control exports and implement a fair distribution of materials, the US government recently sent letters to various countries, requesting them to list the types and quantities of US goods needed for the four seasons from July of this year to June of next year in order to coordinate the distribution. After receiving the US notification, the Ministry of Economic Affairs convened a meeting of relevant agencies in Beijing a few days ago to discuss the matter. Tian Heqing, Director General of the Industrial Association, attended on behalf of the industrial sector. According to what he told reporters after returning to Shanghai yesterday: It was decided at the meeting that each agency should fill out a form and submit it within ten days, and then collect the required numbers to notify the US. The deadline for the industrial sector to submit the report will be extended slightly. The US has notified our country that it will control 258 kinds of exports in total, which are: (1) 44 kinds of wood and its products, (2) 25 kinds of petroleum and its products, (3) 44 kinds of chemicals and pharmaceuticals, (4) 86 kinds of steel products, (5) 41 kinds of non-ferrous metals, (6) 12 kinds of construction materials, (7) 3 kinds of transportation equipment, (8) 3 kinds of miscellaneous items.

### Christian Education Association's Higher Education Conference Opens Yesterday

National Higher Education Research Conference Scheduled

[Our Report] The National Christian Education Association's Higher Education Council held its second day of meetings yesterday. Starting at 9:00 AM, Chairman Tu Yuqing presided. The council first passed a motion to rename the Higher Education Council the "China Christian University Association," an independent organization jointly formed by various church universities, but to maintain close ties with the entire Chinese Christian education system, it will remain within the Education Association. Ge Deji, the association's higher education officer, resigned due to personal reasons, and it was decided to appoint the association's general secretary, Tan Renmei, concurrently. The General Assembly Association also elected a new Executive Committee, with the following members: Chairman Tu Yuqing, Vice Chairman Wei Zhuomin, and members Fang Shuxuan, Li Peien, and Wu Yifang. Ex officio members include Wu Gao, Fang William, and Luo Feiyang. It was also decided to convene a national Christian Equal Education Research Conference this summer. Subsequently, Wu Yifang, chairman of the Thirteen Church Universities Joint Fundraising Committee, reported on the closing matters and allocation methods of the fundraising. It was stated that the current domestic joint fundraising has exceeded the predetermined target. The allocation method is based on the allocation method resolved on October 30, 1947, and is divided into three items: (A) One-half of the target set for each region, plus the government's donation of 6 billion yuan, totaling 10.5 billion yuan, will be allocated according to the following four principles, equally divided into four parts: (1) First, one-quarter of the portion is equally divided among the schools; (2) The second part is allocated according to the total salaries of each school in October of last year; (3) The third part is allocated according to the total number of credit hours of courses offered by each school in the fall; (4) The final one-quarter is allocated according to the reconstruction needs of each school. However, due to the difficulty of investigation, it was decided that, with the exception of West China Union University, which did not suffer war damage, this amount will be equally divided among the other twelve schools. (B) One-half of the donation target for each region will be allocated by each region itself. (C) The amount by which the donations in each region exceed the target will be allocated by each region itself. Furthermore, the 6 billion yuan donated by the government generated 285.05 million yuan in interest by the end of the donation campaign. It was decided to allocate this amount to the China Christian Higher Education Association as a fund for the joint undertakings of national church universities. The General Assembly concluded at noon yesterday.

### President Truman Recounts Childhood Life: Milking Cows and Chopping Wood to Encourage American Youth

[American News, Philadelphia, 20th] President Truman told students at Girard College today that the United States is entering the greatest era in its history and that today's youth have a greater opportunity for advancement than at any time in the past. Girard College, founded more than a century ago, today saw the President visit the school to participate in the 198th anniversary of the birth of its founder, the French philanthropist Girard, and deliver a speech to 1,300 fatherless young men. Girard arrived in the United States with almost no money, later starting a business in shipping and banking.

In his speech, the President compared his own youth on the farm with life today. Truman recalled his own childhood, saying how he would get up in the morning, milk the cows, chop wood, and start a fire to help his mother prepare breakfast. He laughed, "When I was a young boy like you, I had to milk cows day and night. You go into the back and get a glass of milk and don't know where it came from." He then said seriously, "Now we live in the atomic age, an age that either points to the destruction of mankind or to the greatest opportunity in history. I hope I can get through this era, and you will face this era after I am gone. From now on, the United States will be led by young people like you. The United States government should strive to make this era create world welfare and peace and not its destruction. This is the goal of our collective work—peace in the world."

### French Tram Company's Response to a Passenger Dispute Case on Route 24

Re: Your department's forwarded letter from Mr. Shu _, we acknowledge receipt. After investigation by the company, it was found that Li Genfen (transliteration), a passenger on Route 24 trolleybus, falsely reported to the ticket seller and ticket inspector that she had a "pass" and did not purchase a ticket. The company firmly believes that the sender of the letter fabricated the facts to cover up her false reporting. Furthermore, she did not show a long-term ticket from the Shanghai Tram Company. The amount collected by the company's ticket inspector was not a fine, but a partial pre-payment for a long-term ticket. The company is now holding this amount for Mr. Li. We hereby respond to your inquiry, hoping you will take note! Sincerely, to the Shanghai Shen Bao Social Services Department.

### Telegram Questions and Answers

Answered by the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau

[Zhang Ziqiang from Jing'an Temple Road asks:] Which is the cheapest way to send international telegrams?

[Answer:] Code telegrams are the most economical and cost-effective. In addition to various internationally used commercial codes such as Peterson Code, Bentley Code, Acme Code, etc., the three-letter codes composed of English letters in the newly compiled code of the Ministry of Communications of China can be used by grouping them into five-letter sets. Add the word "Plain" to the first line of the telegram, and the fee is 60% of the regular telegram fee. The transmission order is the same as that of regular telegrams. Each telegram is calculated from five words, and if it is less than five words, it is also calculated as five words.

[Mr. Zhu Heyan from Kangding Road asks:] Our company sends out several telegrams every day. Can we settle the account monthly to save procedures?

[Answer:] If you want to avoid paying in cash each time or waiting for a long time when sending telegrams, please use the "pre-paid telegram sending" method. First, go to the main business office at No. 70 Suzhou Road of this bureau to pay a pre-paid telegram fee once. After that, you can send telegrams to various business offices at any time with the telegram receipt book, and the telegram fee will be settled at the end of the month.

### Acknowledgment of Donations

### Saluting the Athletes of Taiwan

— Ding Rongguan

"Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth, the national flag flutters, the singing roars, the athletes of Taiwan dedicate their skills, New Taiwan, new heroes, washing away the sick man of East Asia, a strong country must first have a strong people, forging a strong body, this is the master of the nation!"

——Song for Taiwan Athletes Participating in the National Games.

The magnificent 7th National Games has come to a close. For days, the wind and rain continued, and Jiangwan Road has regained its desolation. One feels the departure of people and the emptiness of the arena! In this National Games, although some regrettable and unpleasant things did happen, on the other hand, we also saw a gratifying bright side. Within ten days, nearly twenty men's and women's track and field and swimming records were broken, which is an extremely brilliant achievement. In terms of the units participating in the Games, there were overseas Chinese who traveled across the ocean from the south and fighters from the war zones in the north who overcame difficulties and dangers, fully demonstrating the spirit of unity and solidarity. Among them, what we admire most and what has set the best example is the style of the athletes from Taiwan.

Taiwan is our country's first territory to fall into enemy hands. For forty years, they have tasted all the sufferings of the world. Now that they have suddenly returned to the motherland, we feel a mixture of sorrow and joy! Their perseverance and law-abiding virtues have moved us deeply. In this National Games, they came as a team and left as a team. They performed short warm-up exercises before the competition, with a beginning and an end, day after day for more than ten days, which was truly refreshing. It is no wonder that such a disciplined and community-minded team has repeatedly won championships in competitions. To be honest, without the participation of the athletes from Taiwan, the achievements of this Games would have been greatly inferior! Furthermore, the spirit of sports lies in the manifestation of discipline. Their adherence to rules and obedience, even apart from their excellent records, is an absolutely perfect success! After the closing of the Games, 118 male and female athletes from Taiwan Province who participated in the National Games left Shanghai on the 17th to visit Hangzhou. The next day, a Hangzhou newspaper reported the news of the Taiwan athletes' arrival in Hangzhou, which stated: "The train arrived at the city station at 11:55 a.m. The athletes were all dressed in black wool jackets and white trousers, with a green shield-shaped armband on their left arm, embroidered with a yellow 'Tai' character. Each carried a simple piece of luggage. After getting off the train in order, they automatically lined up and exited the station in an orderly manner. The good order aroused the surprise of the station staff and passengers on the same train. Shen Mulian, the manager of the Hangzhou branch of the China Travel Service, who was responsible for the reception, also believed that this was the first time this year that the agency had hosted such a large group, and the orderly manner, without requiring them to worry, was unprecedented!" (See the Southeast Daily, Hangzhou Edition, May 18th.) Since the victory, the lack of order among the Chinese people has become a trend. The vibrant "New Life Movement" of more than ten years ago is almost gone, and the decline of morality is no more serious than today! If we want to be among the ranks of first-class powers, we must have the demeanor of first-class citizens. We must strive for unity, and organize ourselves. Sports is the best way to train this spirit. It is hoped that the performance of the athletes from Taiwan this time will be the beginning of the Chinese people's attention to sports and public morality, which would be extremely fortunate!

### Doubts About Zhang Zhidong Killing His Wife

— Qian Dacheng

Yesterday, I read Mr. Zheng Yiwei's "Mystery of Zhang Nanpi's Angry Killing of His Wife" in Free Talk. He recorded the Nanpi killing his wife in the book "Record of Character Appraisal." After receiving a letter from Jiang Shiyao of Guangzhou, he checked Nanpi's Chronicle and said that there was no such thing. Mr. Zheng also doubted the authenticity of his statement. The "Zhang Zhidong Family Letters" published by the workshop, which Mr. Zheng cited, I have also seen, and it does mention the killing of his wife, which does not seem to be a forgery. In the novel "Flower in a Sea of Sins" by Zeng Mengpu, the incident is also alluded to, and Zhidong's behavior is described in a very obscene manner. Chen Shiyi, the teacher who wrote the biography of Zhidong, said that Zhidong was short in stature, unlike a northerner, with a broad forehead and bright eyes, and his hands reached his abdomen, depicting his appearance with subtle criticism. His lack of private virtue is known to everyone. Yan Laoren also told me that the description in "Flower in a Sea of Sins" was not an exaggeration. Zhidong wrote five elegiac poems (with a note lamenting the death of his wife, Ms. Shi of Guangzhou), and here are the third and fifth poems: "I often lose my wine due to my friends, and I am happy to imitate the reclusive; today I am with Jing Gao again, who will admonish Bo Lun on the pillow?" "The empty room is cold and desolate, and I realize my mistakes every year. The village road and the house plan are inferior to Du Duan, what is the use of wearing the girdle to find Xian Wei." The meaning of repentance is expressed in the words. Mr. Jiang argued that the Chronicle of Zhang said that it was not true, and it is necessary to re-examine it and must speculate on the origin of the rumors. Unfortunately, there are no books on hand. After borrowing the Complete Works of Zhang Wenxiang, I will write another article to determine it. Mr. Zheng, would you also be interested in this?

### Coincidence

— Ding Ling

A British iron merchant named Henning was born on the same day and at the same time as King George III in 1738. The day Henning opened his business was exactly the day George III ascended the throne. The two also married on the same day and had nine sons and six daughters. Finally, the two died at the same moment on January 29, 1820.

### Women and Watches

— Mao Yi

If ladies did not use watches, the repair business of clock and watch shops all over the world would definitely suffer a severe blow. This is not to say that women use watches more than men, but that women's watches break more easily than men's. However, this is not to prove that women's watches are made poorly, but that they are used improperly.

According to records, women's watches break at least twice as often as men's watches. According to a study by the New York "Jewelry Workers Union," they said: "Women's purses are the root of broken watches." This judgment is authoritative. Even now, many women put their watches in their purses - even wristwatches. And purses are also the hiding place for perfumes, powders, grease, cigarettes, and other difficult items. Perfume is one of the real culprits.

All kinds of perfumes contain volatile oils. The volatilized oil mixes with the powder and other dust in the purse, and spreads everywhere, penetrating everywhere. Although the watch is tightly sealed, it is difficult to resist the "drilling" of the "oil slurry." Once they drill into the watch, they will hinder the movement of the machine, and then the watch will stop.

Although a woman carefully takes off her wristwatch when swimming, bathing, or doing laundry, she cannot guarantee that her wristwatch will not rust. When cooking, the water vapor sprayed from the pot and teapot will drill into the watch and quickly condense, resulting in the watch rusting. Also, the axles of the machines in the watch are coated with a thin layer of oil. Under normal conditions, this layer of oil can last for a year. However, every time it approaches heat, such as cooking by the stove, some of the oil in the watch will dry out, and the friction of the shaft will increase, thus shortening the life of the watch. - However, if any lady is so scared by reading this article that she does not dare to cook, it is really unnecessary. The advice I offer here is: do not wear a watch when cooking.

### Amidst Layoffs

— Sun He

I heard that the government will continue to streamline redundant agencies and lay off staff in various provinces and cities after the implementation of the constitution. This is a wise measure for the government to simplify administration and save money, and there is nothing wrong with it. However, for those who are laid off, it cannot but be a problem.

From the perspective of those being laid off: some are complaining that the layoffs are unfair, and some are presenting their own performance evaluations to prove that they should not be laid off, and that the reason for the layoff is that there is no way to handle personnel matters. Regarding this, I think it is another issue. Let us assume that everything is fair, and those being laid off are mostly those who are not working hard, but there are still some points worth considering.

One is why these civil servants are not working hard? Are they indulging in pleasure and ease? Then indulging in pleasure and ease requires an environment for indulging in pleasure and ease. If there is, they should not be held responsible - to be honest, today, most civil servants are barely making ends meet. Being able to solve the problem of supporting their parents and raising their children is a supreme blessing. Do they still have the energy to indulge in pleasure? To put it more bluntly: the instability of life, being anxious all day long, and being busy borrowing money or trying to find a way are the facts. Then, making those whose lives are unstable lose their jobs, it is simple and straightforward, but will these people live or not?

Regarding these laid-off people, where will they go after receiving a small amount of severance pay? There are three ways: one is to find a job in another agency. Then, they will still return to the government. Instead of letting them grope in the dark, why not arrange them in a coordinated manner? One is to muddle through in this society, using some improper methods to maintain the livelihood of their families. This probably does not need us to make a judgment. One is to try to do business. There are already too many people doing business. Are we going to train some businessmen to develop commerce? I think there is no need to say more about whether it is right or wrong.

In short, during the period of mobilization for suppressing the rebellion, it is already a "miracle" to have redundant and useless civil servants who are dismissed, but those who are working in the government are encountering unemployment. Is it because the mobilization is too much and there is an excess?

### Also Talking About Writing Habits

— Guo Ping

Mark Twain liked to write in bed. Sometimes, when he was half-asleep and got inspiration, he didn't have time to get paper, so he immediately used a colored pen to write the main text on the pillowcase, because if he delayed it, he would forget everything. Therefore, Mark Twain loved beds the most, because he thought beds were the best thing in the world.

Before Chekhov wrote anything, he always recorded what he saw and heard in a small diary. He didn't like to make up novels, unless it was absolutely necessary.

The British nautical novelist Jack London of the late 19th century always predetermined the content and chapter order of the story a year before writing a novel, and then wrote continuously every day, from about 1,000 words to 2,000 words per day.

Hans Christian Andersen, who wrote fairy tales, liked to write standing up because he suffered from fainting. If he fainted while standing, he could fall on the floor with a thud, so that the people downstairs could hear him, otherwise no one would come to save him.

### 

The National Assembly brings together people from all over the country and all ethnic groups. The number of people is large, and the gathering has a statutory time limit. Therefore, in addition to the formal gathering at the venue, there are various commemorative gatherings, which are very grand events. According to the old city, people from all walks of life in politics, business, and academia also meet from all over the world. There are usually gatherings of the same year, gatherings of the same hometown, gatherings of classmates and colleagues, etc., to make connections and strengthen special friendships. However, I heard that there is also a "same-sex" cordial meeting in this National Assembly, which is an innovation. In the past, members of parliament and officials of various departments were all monopolized by one "sex", but now they are shared by both "sexes", and women are still a relatively small minority, so it is natural and necessary to increase this meeting.

On the chairman's stage of the National Assembly, women representatives have taken the chair several times. According to telegrams from newspapers in Pingjin, they all praised their gentle demeanor and orderly maintenance of order. Although this does not necessarily mean that women are better than men, it is enough to make men reflect! Silently observing the "boo!" and "bang!" sounds in the previous conferences in the north, most of them came from the male seats, while the female seats were mostly quiet. They only smiled at these strange sounds and appearances. I don't know what the situation is in the Nanjing conference this time, but I don't think it will be an exception. May I ask the attendees and listeners who are on the scene, is the group of dignified representatives, the seat of the magnificent National Assembly, whose specialty is a "boo", male or female? Is it that "boo" is the only way to show the male's "special skill"? I also heard that some male representatives complained that the order of the meeting was too bad, and in addition to strange sounds, there were occasional overstepping words and actions. They proposed setting up a "Discipline Committee" to be in charge of impeachment, and advocated that female representatives be the executors. Although this remark may have caused some unconscious laughter, it is not a casual joke, and it is enough to be a reflection of the male's inner feelings. Women are inferior to men in "boo" and "bang". In terms of abiding by the law and enforcing the law, they may not be inferior, or even better than men.

### Excerpts from Yun Jian's Calligraphy and Painting Topics (Part 1)

— Bai Jiao

Radish

Someone who saw Bai Jiu's painting said: Why not use rice to mix lead? I replied: Although He Lang is white, he has no powder, and he can't get the rouge of the jade building. How can he be Zhu Zhu Bai Bai, like the son of the Song family, so that his sister can climb the wall and peep? The Red Pine Village man in December of Xinwei.

Radish

This big earth puff pastry, one from Anzhou and one from Xinyang, weighs five or six catties each, tastes crisp and sweet, and grows in the sand; those that grow in wet land are firm and spicy, difficult to eat and unpalatable. I respectfully send it to Madam Bi to taste the new ones. My family has a collection of 10,000 dans, so this is nothing.

Radish

Today it is poisonous and hot, and I am very thirsty. I thought of radish but couldn't get it, so I wrote this. The meaning is to imitate Cao Cao's driving, pointing to the plum grove from afar. Da Chi in Gengwu.

Radish

It was originally painted as red radish, but unexpectedly it became white radish. Mr. Bai Jiao inscribed it: Do not learn the pretense of village girls, thickly applying rouge.

Radish

Half a catty of radish, a pair of fragrant mushrooms. Shopping for New Year's goods at the end of the twelfth lunar month of Gengwu. Bai Jiao jokingly inscribed it.

Orchid

After painting this orchid, I replanted two roots of thorns. My wife scolded and said: Are there thorns in this place too? I smiled and said: Where is there no such thing!

Orchid

A Lai is four years old. When he saw me painting, he hurriedly climbed onto the peach tree and sat on a corner of the table, holding his breath and staring intently. He always said: It's not like it. This bat was also identified by my A Lai, so it is said that it is not a team.

Orchid

Someone who saw me writing this said: Its flowers want to smile, its leaves have an unsatisfied meaning, and its stones are majestic. I said: What you see is emotion, my pen is alive! But there are still things that cannot be understood, so ask for them from the formless. Bo Lao ordered me to write it, and I respectfully offer it to Bo Can.

Fragrance

Six taels of fragrance, two qian of fragrance companions, cooked together, its taste is fragrant forever, great and boundless. How about I respectfully offer it to Uncle Shi Zi for lunch?

Orchid

Holding purity and containing fragrance, the hometown of Bai Yun, not dressed for the times, who is he who seals me as king!

This work is similar to ancient white but detached, light and fragrant forever, the soul of the poet has a place to rest, and it should be composed by one Jiao.

Orchid

Si Weng wrote Oulan, lying south of the paper. Or it is pointed out as someone who cherishes ink like gold, Yun Jian said: Is it as good as Xiao Fu Wenrong?

Frosty air at the tip of the pen, Xiang soul under the moon, he who understands my intention is the World Honored One.

Mr. Yunjian Han, guests often find it difficult to get what they want. Venerable Fan once said: If a red sleeve grinds the ink, everyone can be happy! This monk has a comprehension and can learn Buddhism. It seems that it is not necessary for him to return to secular life. What does Master Xuedu think?

Orchid

Writing does not necessarily mean talking about sects, and there is a natural flight in the signature. Nanchuan commented on Shanquiao and said: The ultimate in calmness turns into etherealness. This statement is uniquely insightful.

Orchid

Fan Kuan first studied under Li Cheng, and then sighed and said: It is better to learn from nature than to learn from people! This sentence breaks the chaos of the painting family.

Orchid

Sparse is not easy, dense is not easy, neither sparse nor dense, also sparse and also dense, how to get the method? It is not that I have no teachings, the writer said: There is no fixed method in writing.

Orchid is not easy to be dense, and it is not easy to be sparse, who will understand the meaning of the grandson of Chu?

Red Orchid

Emei Su Dongpo wrote red bamboo, and eight hundred years later, Yun Jian had Bai Jiao who wrote red orchids.

Orchid

Someone asked about the orchid, Yun Jian said: The flower is easy, the leaf is difficult, the pen is easy, the ink is difficult, the momentum is easy, the time is difficult, the shape is easy, and the rhyme is difficult. The momentum is in being fast without being hurried, then you get the pen, the time is in being moist without being dry, then you get the ink, and the shape is in having no intentional pretension and being full of posture, then the rhyme is complete. Orchid

Orchid's quality is in the level shoulders, and the painting takes momentum, just like writing which avoids laying out straight. Writing orchids with all the flowers as pointed petals is also not knowing those of noble quality in orchids.

Orchid and Bamboo

It is difficult to write both orchids and bamboo, especially in medicine. However, I think the orchid may be more difficult than the bamboo, then a stroke of the leaf is not right, and the whole paper is ruined.

Both orchids and bamboo come from writing, writing without painting, and the brushwork is particularly close. However, both are not easy. Yu said, "Orchids for three years, bamboo for a lifetime", also said, "Bamboo for three years, orchids for a lifetime", which can be seen.

Wind Orchid

I often write orchids and I am quite proud of myself, so I do it again, but five or six papers are not similar. It is known that my teacher and I cannot be imitated, who wants to imitate me, please refer to this purpose!
