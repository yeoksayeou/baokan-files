### The Authorities Are Closely Watching the Bohai Sea Situation; Foreign Vessels Are Strictly Prohibited from Sailing to Dalian; Fan Hanjie Goes to Qinhuangdao to Deploy Military Forces

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 4th] As the flames of war spread in North and Northeast China, the authorities are closely monitoring the maritime situation in the Bohai Sea. The Tianjin Customs has received orders that all foreign ships, unless specially permitted by the Chinese government to sail to Dalian or other un-opened Chinese ports, should be prohibited from sailing to any opened Chinese port thereafter. If ships sailing in violation of regulations are suspected of having certain purposes, they will be handed over to the Navigation Bureau for investigation and detention. Other ordinary foreign ships will still be handled by the Customs in accordance with anti-smuggling regulations. It is noted that this type of regulation is much stricter than similar regulations last year.

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, 4th] Fan Hanjie, accompanied by Li Weichou, commander of the 62nd Army, left by car for Tangshan and Qinhuangdao at 9:00 AM on the 4th. Fan's command headquarters will be temporarily set up in Qinhuangdao to advance as the situation dictates. A Liaoxi military expert said: "The opportunity to break through the Beining Railway line is still pending. The National Army at Dahu Mountain may have been transferred, but no official report has been received yet. There is no sign that Hu Zongnan's troops will come to North China or Guanwai to provide assistance."

[Special Dispatch from Tianjin, 4th] General Fan Hanjie passed through Tianjin from Beiping on the morning of the 4th to Qinhuangdao. He was accompanied by Lin Weichou, Commander of the 62nd Army, and Xiong Zhengping from the Ministry of National Defense, who came to Beiping for liaison. Military transport is busy in Qinhuangdao Port, and Fan's troops are continuously disembarking.

[United Press Dispatch from Beiping, 4th] Shenyang: It is reported that the Communist bandits are intensifying their offensive against Jinzhou and Liaoyang in order to prevent Fan Hanjie's troops from going north. The Communist bandits are pressing on Jinzhou from the east, west, and north, and shelling the National Army positions twenty miles away from Jinzhou. Clear artillery sounds can be heard in Jinzhou City. Another group of bandits attacked Jinxi, twenty miles southwest of Jinzhou. It is rumored that Zuo Yi's cavalry is leaving the pass to reinforce Jinzhou. The Communist bandits attacking Liaoyang are advancing from the north and south, and have already captured the suburban station four miles north of Liaoyang.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Shenyang, 3rd] The war in Liaoyang has fiercely unfolded. The bandits have repeatedly reinforced their forces and launched a full-scale offensive on the evening of the 30th of last month. Fierce fighting occurred between the two sides, especially in the battle of the Taizi River northeast of the county. The National Army is currently fiercely attacking the invading bandits in the east. (Another dispatch on the 4th) A certain unit of the National Army began to mop up the northwest area of Jiujian on the north bank of the Liao River on the 2nd, and defeated more than a thousand fleeing bandits in the vicinity of Xiaoxinmin City. Another elite unit of the National Army also conducted search and sweep operations in the area west of Fuxin, seizing a large number of spoils.

### Li Mo'an Discusses the Strategy of Suppressing Bandits: Implement "Total War"

Solidify Points, Expand Areas, with Nantong as a Demonstration Zone

[Local News] Li Mo'an, commander of the First Pacification Zone, returned to Nantong from Xuzhou via Shanghai after attending the pacification conference of Jiangsu, Henan, Anhui, and Shandong provinces. Before leaving Shanghai, Li said in a statement: the four-province pacification conference discussed future pacification strategies and decided to "thoroughly unify the party, government, and military," implement a total war of military affairs, politics, and economy, and devote all efforts to the victory of the bandit suppression war and the safety of people's lives. After reviewing the past pacification work, Li said that the shortcomings found in the past were that "our methods were not entirely suitable for the needs of bandit suppression." Therefore, from the six-province joint defense conference last year, the Jiujiang military conference to the recent Xuzhou pacification conference, this issue has been discussed in detail, and countermeasures have been decided. The system and powers of the pacification zone have been changed and expanded to implement "total war." Regarding how to carry out the pacification work in northern Jiangsu in the future, Li said that he will learn from past lessons and formulate new plans, and will make the greatest efforts to break the difficult situation. The main implementation plans for the unification of the party, government, and military are:  Request local party, government, and military personnel to thoroughly take responsibility, correct all procrastination and perfunctory work styles, and use the most economical methods to achieve the greatest goals.  Reduce people's suffering, eliminate waste and corruption, and win people's hearts.  Organize local self-defense efforts and unify their use.  Reorganize the masses to exert their strength. This is the fundamental plan for the bandit suppression war. It is planned to first use Nantong as a demonstration zone, and then promote it to other counties.  Strengthen fortifications, consolidate points, and expand areas.  Strengthen economic warfare, rush to purchase materials produced in the bandit area, and block materials that may be transported to the bandit area. Li Chang also issued a warning: "If we do not concentrate our efforts to destroy the power of the Communist bandits to make trouble at this time, then no one will survive when the Communist bandits arrive."

He Long's troops will temporarily provide Hu Zongnan's troops with a corridor in southwestern Shanxi, and annihilate them after they enter Shanxi, so as to prevent Yan Xishan and Hu Zongnan from joining forces.  After Peng Dehuai deploys a large number of "point-grabbing" battles in Shaanxi, and under the circumstances that Hu's troops are transferred to the east and Ma's troops are contained to the south, he will seize the opportunity to attack Yan'an, Ganquan, Yulin, and other places.

### Rumor of Military Supplies Falling into Bandit Hands; Director Dong Denounces It as Baseless

Distribution Situation Can Be Proved with Charts

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] Director Dong stated at a press conference today: The New York Post published a report by reporter Hobbes on January 30, claiming that half of the 130 million rounds of ammunition shipped from the United States to China last summer were directly sold to the Communist bandits. This news is absolutely without any factual basis. I have obtained information from the Ministry of National Defense, and there are detailed statistical tables on the distribution of the above-mentioned ammunition, which are sufficient to prove that the various sections claimed by Hobbes are not facts. However, this table involves military secrets and cannot be published, otherwise it will only please the Communist bandits. We can assert that the various sections claimed by Hobbes are maliciously fabricated facts and have no basis. As for the accusation that some military supplies were directly sold to the Communist bandits at the Shanghai wharf by government officials, it is even more absurd and not worth refuting. Hobbes' manuscript originated from Washington, and it is said that the news came from "responsible regular bureaus," or it is a deliberate slander. If the State Council really intends to know the truth about this matter, the Ministry of National Defense of our country is ready to provide information at any time.

### The Chairman Summons Du Yuming and Firmly Denies to Reporters That He Will Take a New Position

When Du met with reporters in the evening, he firmly denied the rumors that he would take a new position, and said: when he met with the Chairman, he reported on his health and requested to continue to take a leave of absence for another six months, which had been granted by the Chairman. When reporters asked whether what the Chairman had granted was to continue the recuperation for "six months" or for a "very short period of time," Du did not give a definite answer. Du also said that although his health has improved compared to before, his legs are still not strong enough and he must continue to recuperate. When reporters asked where he would recuperate, Du replied that he would stay in Nanjing for a while before making a decision. Also, at noon on the 4th, Yu Youren also invited Du to lunch, but Du had to meet with the Chairman and left before the end of the banquet.

### Revision of the Commodity Tax Regulations Will Be Announced After the Completion of Legislative Procedures

Tax Revenue in the First Half of This Year Is Expected to Be Twelve Trillion

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] The current commodity tax regulations were revised by the Political Affairs Conference on the 3rd according to the methods proposed by the Ministry of Finance. After being submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures, they can be announced and implemented. The purpose of the revision of the regulations is to rectify tax revenue and increase the income of the national treasury, while also paying attention to reducing the burden on the people and supporting the survival of handicrafts and semi-mechanized industries. In addition to the 60% commodity tax levied on luxury goods, some handicrafts and semi-finished products are exempted from commodity tax, or are otherwise adjusted. The main points of the revision are: Items exempted from tax include: 1. Tea tax will be exempted because it is an export material to encourage foreign sales. 2. Tin foil and superstitious paper. This type of paper should be cracked down on and assigned to local areas. 3. Slaked lime. 4. Cement. Wheat flour that is semi-mechanized will be exempted, while purely mechanized will still be taxed. 5. The fur tax will be changed. Leather and fur will not be taxed, but the wool yarn tax will be levied and parts will be adjusted. Cosmetics that are luxury goods, such as perfume and lipstick, will be taxed at 60%, while ordinary cosmetics, such as vanishing cream and cologne, will be taxed at 30%. There are also important revisions to the tax system. The past regulations stipulated that the assessment should be conducted every three months. Now, in order to take into account the rising prices and avoid losses in tax revenue, it has been decided to change the assessment to once a month based on the principle of actual ad valorem. In addition, the Ministry of Finance plans to increase the levy of "10% gasoline tax." During the discussion at the Political Affairs Conference on the 3rd, it was believed that the gasoline import tax has recently been increased by 40%. It is not convenient to levy commodity tax at this time, so it was not passed. The Ministry of Finance will submit a special case to the Executive Yuan for handling. However, in order to protect production, the mineral tax will continue to be suspended.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] According to information from the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, the total amount of commodity tax revenue in the 36th fiscal year, as of February 3, was 4,640.1 billion yuan, which is more than twice the budgeted 1,240 billion yuan last year. Also, the commodity tax revenue budget for the first half of the 37th year has been pre-determined to be 12 trillion yuan.

### Joint Meeting of Five Committees of the Legislative Yuan to Discuss the National General Budget; The Case Will Be Formally Submitted to the Yuan for Review Today

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] The Finance, Economy, Legal System, Foreign Affairs, and Military Affairs committees of the Legislative Yuan held a joint meeting all day on the 4th, chaired by Liu Ke, to discuss the national general budget for the first half of the 37th year. Xu Kan, Chief Accountant of the National Government, Yu Hongjun, Minister of Finance of the Executive Yuan (representing President Zhang), Yu Dawei, Minister of Communications, Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Social Affairs, Yu Feipeng, Minister of Food, and Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Education, were all present to provide explanations. Xu Kan also stated that if there are no changes in prices, the budget for this half year is expected to be sufficient and there is no need to add additional funds. At the end of the meeting, the committee members put forward opinions on some government measures, which are briefly recorded as follows: The government has no determination to implement the special tax on wealthy families, resulting in a situation where the poor become poorer and the rich become richer. It was previously decided to levy a special construction donation, which was later changed to a special relief donation. The government should be determined to implement this. The reform of the currency system should consider its preparation due to the needs of reality. In principle, the treatment of public education personnel should be improved. The revenue section of the general budget is too small and more empty. Xu Kan, Yu Hongjun, and others gave explanations separately, and decided to invite President Zhang Qun to attend the regular meeting on the 5th to explain the government's policies. After the resumption of the meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 5th, the budget proposal will be formally submitted for review. If time permits, the adjustment of the treatment of public education personnel and the retroactive recognition of the increase in postal and telecommunications prices will also be discussed.

### General Review of Bandit Suppression Military Affairs in the Past Year; Released by the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] The News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense released a general review of bandit suppression military affairs in the past year on the 4th. The full text is as follows:

A Debt of Blood Owed to the Chinese Nation by the Communist Party

Since the summer of the 35th year, the bandit leader Mao Zedong ordered Lin Biao and other bandits in the Northeast to be heavily armed with international supplements to refuse the Chinese people to recover the territory that had been lost for fourteen years. Then, in the autumn and winter of that year, the bandits in Yan'an issued three mobilization orders in a row, provoking war with the 450 million people who were praying for peace. On the one hand, they desperately campaigned in the international community for the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference to interfere in China's internal affairs in order to achieve their conspiracy to divide the country and seize power. At the same time, they also used their consistent deceptive propaganda, using the flesh and blood of the Chinese people to deceive the eyes and ears of the world, flaunting the political capital of the bandits to raise their own worth.

In the past year or so, the losses from the destruction, demolition, and relocation of factories and mines in Northeast and North China by these bandits have been estimated to be over tens of billions of US dollars, which is heavier than the losses of factories and mines during the eight years of the War of Resistance. The cost of the railways, highways, bridges, culverts, vehicles, stations, warehouses, and buildings that were destroyed is enough to provide China with more than 7,000 kilometers of new railways. The public and private hospitals, electrical materials, printing equipment, medical equipment, food and clothing... that were destroyed or burned or plundered and relocated to the bandit nests in the Taihang Mountains, Wutai Mountains... According to the confessions of the prisoners: "Even they secretly shed tears when they saw this destruction!" The amount of this damage is even greater and cannot be statistically calculated.

In total, in the past year, the losses suffered by the Chinese nation in economics, culture, morality, education... from these traitors and bandits are greater than any loss in history from Shi Jingtang, Huang Chao, Zhang Bangchang, Li Zicheng, to Wu Sangui, Wang Jingwei, and others.

Mao Zedong and his bandits are shouting democracy and freedom, but in fact, in the iron curtain of the bandit area, he does not allow any people to have freedom of residence, freedom of belief, freedom of action, or freedom of speech. Their guilty conscience even prevents them from allowing any Chinese and foreign reporters outside the non-bandit area to enter the bandit area for investigation, interviews, and free action.

In the past year, more than 14.51 million refugees have fled from the bandit areas in Northeast China, North China, and Central China. They would rather wander and beg everywhere to breathe the air of freedom than return to their hometowns to suffer the pain of intimidation and coercion. The people who are blockaded in the bandit area are either forced to join the army, or their families are separated, their property is lost, and finally everyone's thoughts, consciousness, and ancestral traditions are liquidated. They have organized all the 30 million people who came to North China, often as working slaves of different ethnic groups. In less than a year, they used "struggle," "liquidation," "joining the army," assassination, and hard labor on the 70 million farmers in the provinces of North China... rapidly reduced the population by about 20 million (according to comprehensive statistics from prisoners and escaped civil servants and students). In fact, the "land reform" in the bandit area has resulted in "fields but no one to cultivate," and everywhere is barren and no one accepts the distribution of land. In this situation of hunger and cold where there are no soldiers to join, no food to collect, and no clothes to wear, the bandit leaders have no choice but to shout out the slogans of "roaming" and "counteroffensive" to "seek clothing," "seek food," and "seek soldiers" in the government areas, intending to disrupt the whole country and replenish their rebellious capital.

The Mao bandit Zedong is still not satisfied with the huge debt of blood that the bandits owe to the Chinese nation. In the past month, he shamelessly confessed to the world that he also intends to drag the 450 million Chinese people and the other 500 million people in Asia into the abyss of the Communist International. However, these treasonous activities have already aroused the anger of all the Chinese people in the past year. The people in the Northeast are demanding that the government step up the recovery of the territory, the compatriots in North China are running around calling for the rescue of the National Army, and the people in Central China are shouting the slogans of "protecting their hometowns" and "destroying the traitors" everywhere. The people in South China are also stepping up mobilization to urge the government to quell the rebellion. In the past year, the bandits have been defeated in batches, gangs have been fleeing for their lives, and groups have been escaping to the mountain strongholds. The bandits in northern Jiangsu, Shandong, northern Shaanxi, and other areas north of the Yangtze River have even been forced to begin training the three methods of "breaking up into parts," "integrating from parts," and "transforming bandits into people" after being defeated.

### Weng Wenhao Talks About the Work of the Resources Committee; Planning to Establish a Steel Plant in Jiangnan; Striving to Maintain the Foundation of Enterprises in the Northeast

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the Resources Committee, met with reporters on the 4th and talked about the work of the committee this year, saying: The work of the Resources Committee is to do its best to develop national resources in coordination with the overall national policy. The industrial and mining enterprises in our country are the largest in the Northeast, followed by North China and Taiwan. Unfortunately, in the past two years, the industrial and mining construction in the Northeast was first taken away by the Soviet army, and then destroyed by the Communist bandits. The Communist bandits have also continuously harassed the North China region, making it difficult to carry out work. It is extremely painful that the essence of the national industrial base is being obstructed and destroyed by bandits. At present, we are deeply aware of the importance of the enterprises in the Northeast, and we should strive to maintain their foundation under the protection of the National Army. North China is still better than Taiwan and cannot be ignored. For example, the power generation and steelmaking equipment in the Tangshan, Tianjin, and Beiping line is complete and of considerable scale. We will continue to actively open furnaces and increase production. The industrial and mining construction in Jiangnan will be carried out with all efforts, mainly in five aspects: Expand the equipment of the four coal mines in Central China, western Jiangxi, Xiangkou, Huxiang, and Xiangyong, and actively increase production to supply Wuhan, Guangdong, and other places. Use the foreign exchange earned from the export of iron ore from Hainan Island to build steel plants. Preparations for the establishment will be made this year. The Kaohsiung Refinery in Taiwan was repaired last year, and there is no problem with the large-scale refining of oil. We are now trying to transport more crude oil. Four of our oil tankers have been damaged in the past. One was repaired last year, and it is now on its second trip from Arabia to transport crude oil back to Kaohsiung, 10,000 tons each time. The second ship can be repaired soon, and production can be doubled at that time. Other production targets are 300,000 tons of grain, 360,000 tons of cement, and 25,000 tons of paper. The equipment of Taiwan's industrial and mining industries is gradually expanding, seeking full development.

### The National Economic Council Will Discuss Today; Economic Plans Involving Four Departments of Finance and Communications

### Minister Yu of Communications Talks; Actively Restore Transportation and Industry and Mining

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] The last of the ten economic reform plans formulated by President Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan is to restore transportation and industry and mining to the greatest possible extent. Reporters specially interviewed Minister of Communications Yu Dawei to inquire about this matter. Yu expressed great enthusiasm for this. He said: The Ministry of Communications has been carrying out this plan at any time in the past year, and will continue to do so more actively in the future. Yu pointed out that the country is divided into three major parts: North China, Central China, and South China. In North China, the Ministry of Communications will do its best to repair and open traffic lines and plan to expand new roads within a possible scope. Keeping the Beining Railway in the north open to traffic, opening the southern section of the Jinpu Railway in Central China, and building the Yuehan, Zhegan, Xiangguiqian railways in South China are all being worked on every day. Yu's remarks fully showed his perseverance and confidence.

### The Implementation Points for Gradually Reducing Living Subsidies Have Been Drafted

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 4th] The State Council passed the principles for adjusting the treatment of civil and military officials this year. Regarding the method of gradually reducing the living subsidy of various civil and military agencies by 5% per month from February, the Executive Yuan submitted it to the Yuan meeting on the 3rd for discussion. It was resolved to ask the Chief Accountant of the National Government, the Secretaries-General of the Five Yuan, and the Minister of Finance to jointly discuss the specific implementation methods. A meeting was held in the Executive Yuan at 4:00 PM on the 4th, chaired by Chief Accountant Xu Kan. After detailed discussions and adoption, and with reference to the written opinions submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Supervisory Yuan the day before, the key points of the resolution, in addition to being submitted to the State Council, are recorded as follows: Reduce the living subsidies of various agencies. A total of 10% will be reduced in February and March this year. The responsible authorities will make overall plans on their own. How to handle it after April will be handled together when the next period of living subsidies is adjusted. Members of the Judicial, Legislative, Supervisory, and Examination Yuan, members of the Senate, judges, and teachers are not subject to the above restrictions. Business organizations should strictly restrict additional personnel and may not transfer business expenses to personnel expenses. Military administrative agencies will be handled in accordance with the first method. In the future, vacancies in various agencies will not be filled, and no additional personnel may be added.

### French Troops in Vietnam Invade Yunnan Territory; We Lodged a Strong Protest

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Kunming, 4th] The commissioner's office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here recently lodged a strong protest with the French consul in Yunnan, because more than 100 French armed forces in Vietnam invaded Kangping Township, Jiangcheng County, Yunnan Province, on December 27 of last year, indiscriminately shot at villagers, and robbed merchants of more than 30 carts of goods. Our country has requested the French side to guarantee that the same thing will not happen again in the future and to reserve the right to compensation for losses.

Will severely punish South China smuggling

### British Memorandum on the Kowloon Incident: We Will Give a Detailed Reply; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Ordered the Ambassador to the UK to Handle It

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 4th Dispatch] Regarding the Sino-British negotiations, Shi Zhaoying, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, announced at a press conference on the 4th that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed Zheng Tianxi, our ambassador to the UK, to provide a full reply to the memorandum from British Foreign Secretary Bevin on the 4th of last month regarding the Kowloon Walled City. The content may be announced at an appropriate time. The Chinese government earnestly hopes that the British government can accept our recommendations as soon as possible, adopt the same point of view on the Kowloon Walled City incident and the problems it has caused, and quickly seek an agreement for resolution. When answering inquiries from foreign reporters, Shi also explained that the Chinese government is aware of the sympathetic actions of Guangdong public groups organizing comfort missions to Kowloon to console compatriots in distress and providing assistance with daily necessities, but believes that there is no need to interfere. Although the Chinese government is willing to do its best to prevent the situation from deteriorating, the Chinese government's preparation of housing for those forced to relocate is a relief measure by the An'an County and has no other meaning.

### US Reynolds Company Borrows 20 Million to Develop Taiwan's Aluminum Industry; This Move is Purely Private Business Activity

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 4th Dispatch] According to inquiries made by reporters to relevant parties, the US investment in Taiwan's aluminum mining is a private commercial activity and should not be confused with US aid to China. After Reynolds came to China, he had discussions with the person in charge of the National Resources Commission. He came to Nanjing on the 2nd of this month and met with Ambassador Stuart, after which he returned to Shanghai and continued negotiations with the person in charge of the National Resources Commission in Shanghai with his agent Xu Shikang (former professor of the Department of Sociology at Yenching University). The principle is to provide loans to help increase production, exclusively operate orders, and survey the total reserves. The US side also believes that the quality of Taiwan's aluminum mines is not as good as that of Guangxi Province.

[Our Newspaper Taipei 4th Dispatch] It is reported that Taiwan Aluminum Corporation has borrowed 20 million US dollars from the US side, and the agreement was signed in Nanjing on the 2nd.

[United Press Nanjing 4th Dispatch] A spokesman for the National Resources Commission told a United Press reporter today that the commission has reached a preliminary agreement with the board of directors of New York's Reynolds Metal Company to cooperate technically in the development of Taiwan's aluminum industry. However, these negotiations are limited to technical cooperation with the company. The rumor that the Chinese and American governments are negotiating joint development of Taiwan in Shanghai and other places is definitely not true. There is an existing aluminum plant in Taiwan Province that can extract 300 tons of aluminum per month from soil ore mined in Fujian. With the assistance of Reynolds Company in the future, the output will definitely be effectively increased.

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou 4th Dispatch] Recently, the Guangdong people have attached great importance to General Wedemeyer's suggestion to the government that it should focus on the economic and political construction of South China. This has become a topic of discussion, and they hope that it can be effectively implemented.

[Our Newspaper Report] New York, 4th Radio: Washington News, Secretary of State Marshall said at a press conference today that he could not yet say when the aid to China plan would be submitted to Congress.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 4th Dispatch] Miao Jiaming, chairman of the Committee of the US Relief Materials Office of the Executive Yuan, told our reporter that 1.8 million US dollars of aid to China in the US aid to foreign countries plan has been stipulated to be used mostly for purchasing grain to enrich the allocation of grain in the five major cities. The conversion standard for the allocation of flour in Pingjin and the allocation of rice in the three southern cities has been changed to weight in jin and liang. One jin of flour is equivalent to one jin of rice. The original standard of 49 pounds of flour per bag equivalent to 4 dou of rice has been abolished.

Editorial

### Sino-US Cooperation in Developing Taiwan

According to our newspaper's Nanjing news, China and the United States are conducting consultations on developing Taiwan Province's rich resources and supporting Taiwan's industrial and mining enterprises. The US side is very concerned about investing in assistance and focuses on two points: one is economic, that is, supporting industrial and mining enterprises, and the other is military, where the US will help us complete our plan for a naval base in Taiwan. Currently, this investment cooperation is no longer a problem in principle, and technical issues are currently being studied. If it is realized, the US will not only provide economic assistance to us, but also send a large number of technical personnel to Taiwan to assist in the work. According to a United Press dispatch from Nanjing, responsible persons said that General Wedemeyer, when conducting an on-the-spot investigation of the situation in China, proposed a South China economic revival plan, which stated that if the politics and economy of South China can be stabilized, the United States is willing to provide assistance. Today, when the whole country is quelling the rebellion and striving for production and national construction, we feel infinite joy at the news.

Originally, since the victory, we should have actively developed Taiwan and South China. Taiwan has been occupied for nearly 50 years. During these 50 years, the people of Taiwan have tasted the bitterness of Japanese warlord rule. Now that the mountains and rivers have regained their light, in addition to expressing infinite excitement about Taiwan's return to the motherland, the people of the whole country also hope that Taiwan's return to the motherland can benefit the development of our national economy in the future and increase the prosperity of Taiwan itself. In the past 50 years, Japan's management of Taiwan was entirely centered on Japan and entirely centered on Japan's defense needs. The starting point was entirely to exploit Taiwan's resources for Japan's use. What it implemented can be said to be a completely colonial economic policy, which is obviously detrimental to the prosperity of Taiwan's own economy. This situation should have been corrected long ago since Taiwan's return to the motherland. Only because of the rebellion of the communist bandits in the country, the people of the whole country mobilized to quell the rebellion, and the government was unable to take care of this for a while, so it has been delayed until now. Whenever we think of this, in addition to hating the communist bandits for harming the country, we also feel deeply regretful. However, our suppression of the rebellion is progressing in parallel with national construction. By suppressing the rebellion and building the country at the same time, we can complete the construction of this Three Principles of the People Republic as soon as possible. When it comes to construction, we cannot but first think of Taiwan.

The past 50 years of Japanese rule have given Taiwan a considerable industrial base. As mentioned earlier, this industrial base is centered on Japan and may not be beneficial to Taiwan. We must find ways to correct it. For example, in today's Taiwan, there are Japanese-operated petroleum factories and sugar manufacturing industries, but Taiwan does not have large amounts of aluminum ore and petroleum production. In agriculture, Taiwan has barren land and many mountains, and it is not suitable for the production of sugar cane. For the needs of Japan, Taiwanese farmers were forced to abandon the economically advantageous production of grain. And the camphor industry, which Taiwan once monopolized in the world market, used to account for 80% of the world's total, but now it has declined beyond recognition. How to correct this economic situation and, furthermore, how to fully develop Taiwan's resources should be the objects that our country should strive to achieve in the great cause of national construction. Moreover, the industrial and mining equipment in the nine northeastern provinces has been mostly moved and destroyed since the victory. If we want to establish an important economic zone like the Ruhr area, we cannot ignore Taiwan.

Therefore, we are delighted and hopeful about the news of Sino-US cooperation in developing Taiwan. According to reports, Sino-US cooperation in Taiwan will include both military and economic aspects. From an economic point of view, we should eliminate the Taiwanese economic facilities and systems centered on Japan in the negative aspect, and strive to enable Taiwan's unique industries to have sound development and how to make Taiwan's economic construction coordinate with the economic construction of the entire nation in the future. The United States' cooperation with us in developing Taiwan is not only another symbol of the traditional friendship between China and the United States, but also a reflection of the Marshall Plan in Asia. Although we still do not understand whether Sino-US cooperation in Taiwan is part of the US aid to China plan, judging from current signs, if it is included in the US government's aid to China plan, we are afraid that this cooperation may not be able to achieve ideal results. Because according to news reports, the US government's aid to China plan only amounts to 300 million US dollars, which must be paid in 15 months, which is a drop in the bucket and seems to be of little help. If the development of Taiwan is included, the amount of aid to China must be increased; otherwise, a separate project should be proposed. We do not need to reiterate here how this investment is beneficial to the United States, which has already been concluded among discerning people.

As for military construction, Taiwan is a strategic location, and its importance is self-evident. We are especially interested in the US helping us complete our plan for a naval base in Taiwan. This reminds us that the Zheng family, father and son, occupied Taiwan thanks to the help of the navy. In the future efforts to build the country, we should not ignore the importance of the navy. In the war of resistance against Japan, because our sea borders were not secure, the enemy army was able to run rampant without hindrance. Fearing this lesson, the construction of our navy in Taiwan should not be delayed. We hope that due to the cooperation between China and the United States, our naval construction in Taiwan can be completed according to plan, and Taiwan's economic resources can be fully utilized. This will ensure the stability of the region and the peace of the Pacific and even the entire world!

Correction

In yesterday's editorial "Stability First, Rule of Law Supreme," the last few sentences were inverted and misprinted. The corrected version is as follows: "On the other hand, we must also think carefully about all measures and facilities, and must not give them a few more topics! We want to ask everyone across the country to pay attention: Stability First! Rule of Law Supreme!"

### Purchasing Finished Products to Rescue Industry; Shen Xirui Has Agreed on Measures in Tianjin; Banks Providing Loans Strictly Monitor Usage

[Central News Agency Tianjin 4th Dispatch] Shen Xirui, Director of the National Bank Business Bureau, was ordered to come to Tianjin to purchase finished products from various factories and rescue small and medium-sized industries. He has now agreed on measures with the Tianjin authorities. The details are as follows: After the finished products of various factories are purchased, they are not allowed to be redeemed with interest. For small and medium-sized factories and handicrafts, the interest rate on the 40 billion loans through commercial banks has been changed to 18% to prevent malfeasance. The 8% exceeding the original interest rate will be donated by the contracting bank for local public welfare. The loan period is set at half a month to prevent price fluctuations after the Spring Festival. Each lending bank should strictly examine the use of the purchase price applied for by each factory and is not allowed to transfer it to other uses. If any violation of the aforementioned regulations is found, it will be handed over to the competent authority for discussion and punishment.

### Profit Tax; Minister of Finance Says Collection Methods are Fair

[Central News Agency Nanjing 4th Dispatch] After the Executive Yuan announced and implemented the 37th year's profit tax collection method, Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun issued a statement saying: "In order to mobilize the suppression of the rebellion and implement emergency measures, the government's profit tax collection method for this year refers to the spirit of the tax estimation system in various countries and adopts the tax estimation system. Therefore, the calculation procedures for this type of income tax are more complicated, and collection often starts from February and March each year until September and October, which cannot meet financial needs. In order to reduce issuance and balance revenue and expenditure, this department has repeatedly studied and submitted it for approval, so that taxpayers can pay in advance according to the estimated tax amount, and refund more and compensate less after the actual tax amount is assessed according to the tax law. As for tax refunds, interest will be added to the local central bank deposit interest rate. The estimated tax amount is calculated based on six times the tax amount of each taxpayer's profit last year. The national budget for this year is 20.5 times higher than that of the 36th year, and the profit tax revenue budget for this year is 14 times higher than that of the 36th year. In addition, the national price index for the 36th year increased by about 12 times compared to the 35th year. Now, according to the tax amount of last year, it is estimated and paid at six times first, which is still a low estimate. In order to adapt to revenue and expenditure and seize the time for tax collection, the government stipulates that it should be estimated and paid at six times first, and the rest will be refunded more and compensated less after the actual tax amount is assessed, which is naturally fair. For businesses established in November of the 36th year, the temporary tax amount is tentatively estimated at 12.6% of the actual paid-up capital, which is an even lighter burden. I hope that all industries will be aware of the difficulties of the times and actively pay taxes. I also hope that the media will promote and assist in various ways.

### Aerial Survey of Mount Jishi, China and the U.S. to Sign Agreement

Sabban Tung Dismisses Uranium Exploration Rumors as Absurd

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Dr. Sabban Tung, Chairman of the Sino-American Mount Jishi Survey Committee, recently told a Central News Agency reporter that the agreement between China and the United States regarding the aerial survey of Mount Jishi will be signed in the shortest possible time. However, permission for future entry flights and landings will require a final decision by the Chinese government. Mr. Tung expressed great doubt about external rumors that the survey team would explore for uranium mines, saying, "This is absurd and ridiculous. No one can fly at an altitude of 30,000 feet and search for uranium mines." He went on to explain that uranium itself can emit three types of rays, but cosmic rays can also emit the same type of rays. Even if a specially made "Liberator" aircraft is equipped with the rumored uranium mine detector, it cannot determine whether the three types of rays come from uranium mines, cosmic rays, or other sources. Moreover, the three types of rays said to be emitted by uranium are short-wave rays, which are difficult to detect unless at close range. Mr. Tung said that when the survey team departs in the future, the Chinese government will send a military liaison officer to accompany each flight. At the same time, the publicly released and confidential parts of the survey results will be decided by our authorities. Mr. Tung finally pointed out that whether Mount Jishi is the highest mountain is insignificant. The mountain has never been surveyed, and the current work will enrich our scientific knowledge.

### A General Review of the Communist Suppression Military Situation Over the Past Year (Continued from Page One)

Analysis of the War Situation in the Past Year

The capital that the bandits use to create chaos and sell out the country is "joining the army," "expanding the army," and "military communism." As long as they control a certain number of people, they strictly seal off the men, women, old, and young among those people and implement military control that is even more thorough than that of the "Nazis." As early as the winter of 1945, after bandit leader Mao Zedong returned to Yan'an from Chongqing, he proposed in the bandit's Central Political Bureau a directive to prepare to expand the guerrillas by three million in the rear of the anti-Japanese positions covered by the National Army in various war zones. When the Japanese devils surrendered, the bandit leaders sent the unarmed old Eighth Route Army, local Eighth Route Army, and New Fourth Army from Sulu, Ji, Jin, Re, Cha, Sui, etc., to the Northeast to seize weapons. They pretended to resist Japan, but never formally fought the Japanese devils. They claimed to love the country, but in China, North, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and East Mongolia, they are still instigating "independent" and "autonomous" movements to split China. Since the communist bandits' rebellion, in the past year and a half, although the casualties and losses of the National Army have totaled nearly 500,000, the number of bandit soldiers killed, dispersed, surrendered, and captured by the National Army has exceeded 1,387,567 (including 765,000 bandit officers and soldiers killed and captured last year). This is because the bandits use the good Chinese people controlled by communist party cadres and political commissars, plus a "Liberation Army" hat, as the political capital of the bandits. They divided the peasants in Northeast China and North China into five command systems and handed them over to bandit leaders Lin Biao, Nie Rongzhen, Chen Yi, Liu Bocheng, Chen Geng, Xu Xiangqian, Peng Dehuai, and He Long to command separately. In total, they have now expanded to 1,150,000 field army, military region troops, and militia.

They are expanding their army so desperately and constantly launching adventurous wars, relying on the support of international accomplices. In 1947, the bandit army occupied 338 cities and towns of various sizes in Lai North, North China, and Central China. However, after the National Army began to mobilize for a general offensive, in about half a year, 72 important cities and towns were recovered, and 266 cities and towns were still occupied by the bandits, some of which had been gained and lost two or three times or more. In the process of gaining and losing these areas, we have discovered tens of thousands of people who yearn for freedom, waving to us and cheering. They lost their freedom and realized how lovely true freedom is. They were deceived by the bandits' division of land, family members were scattered, relatives and friends became enemies, and as a result, the land was nationalized, the food was turned in, and they could not even feed themselves with what was left. Finally, they had to "join the army" as cannon fodder, leading to family ruin and financial ruin.

In the past twelve months, there have been as many as 82 large and small battles on the battlefield, averaging five to ten fierce battles every month. In the past three months, the number of battles has increased to almost twelve to nineteen times each month. In particular, the bandits, in the past four months, have been beaten everywhere in western Henan, eastern Henan, western Shandong, southern Shandong, and northern Anhui by the local defense corps. In Henan province alone, the local defense corps, in cooperation with the National Army, killed 73,181 bandits and more, while the local defense corps suffered only 18,400 casualties. The bandits hated these local defense corps who were fighting for the survival of the peasants and shouted the slogan "eliminate the local defense corps." However, as a result, the people who "defend their homes and kill bandits" in China have become stronger and stronger. They have reorganized the spirit of "fighting the Japanese devils" in the past eight years and used it to fight these blood-sucking demons.

In these battles, the losses of the National Army were only in a ratio of three to one compared to the losses of the bandits. In each war, the bandits used machine guns and artillery to force the local military region troops and militia to charge on the front line. If they succeeded by luck, the bandits would promote the militia and military region troops to the field army, and then fight on the second line. If the militia were all sacrificed on the front line, and it looked like the National Army was about to defeat the bandits' field army, they would slip away in advance. This is the fundamental reason why the strength of the old bandits is not easily lost and the population of the bandit area is rapidly decreasing. Although the bandits used this inhuman "human wave tactics," they still could not drown the heroic spirit of the National Army. In the past year, excluding the Northeast, in North China and Central China alone, the National Army captured a total of 373 various artillery pieces, 525 heavy machine guns, 1,343 light machine guns, and 107,756 long and short, new and old rifles. These all have detailed statistics and sources, times, places, and records of each battle, as well as charts and photos.

However, this achievement in suppressing the bandits is not considered a great achievement of the National Army. Our achievement is still in the strategic gain of shortening the lives of the bandits.

The government's bandit suppression strategy is to fight a quick battle and make a central breakthrough, on the one hand, to break the bandit's political center and entrenched old nest, and on the other hand, to block and suppress the bandits' chaotic and destructive movements. Therefore, the evolution of the bandit suppression strategy in the past year has broken the bandit's political center Yan'an and the important base in Shandong and Jiao, cut off the bandit's supply line at sea, and blocked the bandit's seven offensives of destruction and chaos in the Northeast. As long as we review the communist bandits' propaganda documents on "defending Yan'an," "defending Shandong," "counter-attacking northern Shaanxi," and "counter-attacking Shandong," as well as the fact that the communist bandits launched a nationwide general counter-offensive and implemented a full-scale chaos since last September, we can prove that the communist bandits' strategy has failed and the government's bandit suppression strategy has been successful. This success is giving the "war of attrition" advocated by Mao Zedong a relentless blow.

Today, the Chinese people, through objective analysis and comparison, all know that the communist bandits' policies are international, class-based, destructive, disruptive, dictatorial, and dark. At the same time, they also know that the policies of the National Government and the Kuomintang are national, people-based, constructive, peaceful, democratic, and bright. This has been proven by thousands of facts. Therefore, we can conclude here that although the future of bandit suppression is still very difficult, the final result will definitely be that suppressing the chaos will surely be victorious and building the country will surely be successful (end)

### Overall War Situation for the Past Week

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The Ministry of National Defense issued a statement on the 4th regarding the overall war situation for the week of January 29 to February 4. The full text is as follows:

The National Army in all war zones has become active this week according to the war situation. Some are advancing rapidly to predetermined favorable areas, and some have already begun the prelude to victory. After recovering Dongfeng and Xifeng, the National Army in northern Liaoning in the Northeast took advantage of the victory to pursue and suppress the bandits and has controlled the villages and towns east of the central Chang Railway. Since the launch of the mopping-up operation in the Jilin-Changchun area, many remnants of the Chinese-Korean-Mongolian bandits have been defeated. At the moment, there are few bandit traces within a hundred miles around Jilin and Changchun. Under this situation, the bandits in southwestern Liaoning, fearing the joint attack by the National Army inside and outside the Pass, gathered their 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th columns and moved to the southwest of Liaoyang and Xinmin and Heishan, Dahushan, and other places in a chaotic manner. One force once infiltrated the Wogou gangzi and even reached the vicinity of Jinzhou, trying to cut off the Ping-Shen traffic and reduce the pressure of the National Army's eastward advance. However, the elite troops of the National Army are pouring out of the Pass and arriving at predetermined locations, ready to give the bandits a head-on blow.

In the Hebei-Chahar area, the National Army in southern Chahar captured as many as 12 bandit armory factories, food and clothing factories, and important military warehouses in the battles to recover Sihaizhan and Huanghuacheng, all of which were weapons, ammunition, food, and fodder. Then, on January 30, they also recovered important strongholds such as Sangshu, Qingshiyan, and Huangshixie. As for the 1st and 7th columns of the bandits in North China, they are still hiding in the mountains southwest of Pingbao Qian for reorganization. The remnants of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 6th columns are scattered in the vicinity of Anxin, Tangxian, Wen'an, and Dingxian. On the one hand, due to the disintegration of military morale and the wavering of cadres, they are conducting internal re-examinations, purges, and struggles. On the other hand, they are forcibly recruiting people in various villages to "join the army" in order to replenish their forces and plot further rebellions.

As for Liu Bocheng's bandit troops in the Dabie Mountains, they have exhausted all their tricks to avoid the encirclement and annihilation by the National Army. However, our heroic National Army will never let up and is pursuing and suppressing them everywhere. In the northwest of Yuexi, they defeated more than 1,000 bandits from the 3rd Column and captured 401 alive. In addition, between Xincai, Zhengyang, and Xixian on the north bank of the Huai River, after four days of pursuit and suppression, as of yesterday, a total of four regiments and two companies of the main force of the 1st and 2nd Columns of the bandits were defeated. The bandits are now fleeing in all directions, breaking up into smaller units, and the National Army is intensifying its search and suppression.

As for Chen Yi's bandit troops in the Lu-Yu area, the Liangguang Column was attacked by the National Army west of Taikang and fled westward through the area between Fugou and Xihua. Their 8th, 10th, and 11th Columns are still being besieged by the National Army in the area of Dingtao, Caoxian, and Chengwu. The 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns were forced to gather around Yancheng, trying to join forces with Chen Geng's bandit troops to break out of a living path. However, the National Army north and south of the Ping-Han Line is coordinating with local troops to attack. It is expected that the bandits in this area will be severely annihilated, or the bandits will continue to embark on the path of escape.

While the wandering bandits were running east and west, the people in all bandit-occupied areas launched a heroic self-defense struggle against the bandits and organized self-defense corps, donating money and providing guns and food to protect their homes. This great movement has gradually spread to the bandit areas, not only making the communists in various places tremble but also forcing the bandit leaders to shout "re-examination," "purge," and "purge the army" to consolidate their internal rule. Precisely because their internal contradictions are deepening and the number of military and government cadres wavering is increasing, their mutual killings and struggles are even more tragic. We expect that in the near future, the overall war situation will surely show a new situation with the flood of popular self-defense and the internal strife of the bandit troops.

### Three Powers to Meet in London on the 19th to Discuss West German Administrative Reform, Britain and the United States Urge France to Join Federal Bank to Avoid Currency Division, Frankfurt Charter Could Be Announced Next Week

[Our Newspaper] New York 4th Broadcast Washington News: Secretary of State Marshall confirmed at a press conference today that Britain, the United States, and France will hold a meeting in London on February 19 to discuss the possibility of merging the three occupation zones of Britain, the United States, and France.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 4th] A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry announced on the 4th that the meeting of Britain, the United States, and France to discuss the future status of West Germany will begin in London on February 19. France and the United States will each send their ambassadors to the United Kingdom as representatives. British and American officials hope to persuade France to join the British and American common occupation zones and organize the Rhineland occupation zone so that West Germany can be controlled by a single administrative agency.

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 3rd] German officials believe that the reason for the delay in announcing the Frankfurt Charter is that Britain, the United States, and France have not yet concluded their discussions on the establishment of a West German Federal Bank. The draft charter for the merged zone, which was revised based on the Frankfurt resolution in January, is expected to be published by the British and American authorities early next week. If negotiations on the four powers' unified German currency reform fail, the proposed West German Federal Bank will play a very important role in any West German currency reform. Therefore, although Britain and the United States are willing to no longer wait for France and proceed directly with the administrative reform of the merged zone, they are eager for France to participate in the Federal Bank to avoid the division of the West German currency system. The currency cooperation plan to be discussed at the London Britain-United States-France meeting is not expected to promote France's complete integration with the British and American zones, but will promote the removal of some zone barriers, including the free movement of goods and passengers. The establishment of a central bank shared by the three occupation zones will also be given priority. Relevant parties believe that in addition to consulting with France on the political and administrative nature of the implementation of the merged zone reform, Britain and the United States have also consulted with France on the establishment of a bank. It is said that the main difficulty is still the dispute between federalism and centralism. The British and American draft stipulates that the governors of the state banks should jointly elect the board of directors of the Federal Bank, while German experts believe that the board of directors should not be too restrained by the state banks, so they advocate that the president of the Federal Bank should appoint the board of directors.

[Reuters, Stuttgart, 3rd] General Clay, the U.S. military government chief in Germany, held a press conference here today, stating that the U.S. government welcomes Germany to have a federal government. When discussing the composition of federal institutions, including the division of powers between the central government and the states, it will inevitably take a long time. The United States went through this process at the beginning of its founding. He hopes that the future German government should be flexible rather than rigid. Any government approved by the majority of the German people is welcomed by the American people. Clay also revealed that the declaration of the Frankfurt German Economic Committee is expected to be published next week, and the work of purging the Nazis can be completed around June 1, 1948.

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 3rd] News today: The German Economic Committee of the British and American merged zone in Germany has recommended to the merged zone control committee that the merged zone immediately conclude trade agreements with the Netherlands, Denmark, Italy, Turkey, Sweden.

### The United States is Studying a New Plan for Military Assistance to Greece and Turkey, Marshall Announced at a Press Conference

[Our Newspaper] New York 4th Broadcast: Washington News, Secretary of State Marshall told a press conference today that the State Department is considering the possibility of implementing a new plan for military assistance to Greece and Turkey. The recommendations made by the U.S. delegation to Greece on the plan are being studied by the State Department.

[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 3rd] According to Admiral Seitel, director of the U.S. naval committee, who recently arrived in Ankara, the United States will give the Turkish government a total of 22,000 tons of submarines and auxiliary ships. He also said, "We intend to strengthen the insult military equipment of the Ismit Bay base, and we intend to send naval instructors with naval equipment to Turkish naval schools. In short, we are willing to apply the experience of modern warfare to the Turkish navy." Admiral Seitel previously served as the U.S. naval commander in North China and Korea.

### Secretary Marshall Warns Congress Not to Cut Aid to Europe

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] Marshall today issued another warning to the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, pointing out that if Congress intends to cut the aid funds for the first fifteen months of the implementation of the Marshall Plan to below $6.8 billion, the success of the aid to Europe plan will be hindered. When Marshall issued this warning to Congress, outsiders demonstrated at the State Department, opposing the plan's proposal to transfer American ships to European countries. The demonstration was organized by the National Maritime Union, which opposed selling or transferring 500 American merchant ships to Europe.

### Sweden Not to Join West European Union System

[Reuters, London, 4th] Stockholm Radio announced that Sweden will not participate in any West European union system, as recently proposed by British Foreign Secretary Bevin. A British Foreign Office spokesman said that he was not surprised by this because Sweden has always advocated neutrality, so the United Kingdom has not contacted it.

### Romanian Prime Minister Visits Soviet Capital, Stalin Receives Him

[Reuters, Moscow, 3rd] Stalin received Romanian Prime Minister Groza, who led a delegation, at the Kremlin today. Foreign Minister Molotov was also present. The Romanian delegation arrived in Moscow yesterday and will sign a treaty of friendship, cooperation, and mutual assistance with the Soviet Union. It is also learned that Hungarian Prime Minister Dinai will lead Foreign Minister Meirna to Moscow in the second half of the month.

### Soviet Union Officially Abolishes Holiday Commemorating Victory over Germany

Designated May 9 as Memorial Day for Victory in Europe

[Associated Press, Moscow, 4th] The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union announced: To amend the order of May 8, 1945, which designated May 9 as a public holiday for victory in the European theater, but did not explain the reason for the amendment. From now on, the day of victory over Germany will no longer be a holiday in the Soviet Union.

### Soviet-Occupied Zone of Germany Strengthens Economic Effectiveness

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 3rd] The Soviet side recently announced that the Soviet military government in Germany intends to grant administrative powers to the Central Economic Committee of the zone. The Soviet Economic Committee is an advisory organization with the power to provide only suggestions and draft laws, but these suggestions and draft laws have never been followed by the state governments. From now on, the Soviet Central Economic Committee will have a permanent chairman, giving him concrete powers. The tasks of the committee and its president will therefore be the same as those of the Economic Guidance Committee of the British and American merged zone in Frankfurt. The Soviet side stated that this move aims to strengthen the economic effectiveness of the Soviet zone and is not intended to counter the decision of the British and American military governments to establish a joint administrative agency for the two zones.

### General Strike of Workers in Western Germany Ends

[Associated Press, Stuttgart, Germany, 4th] The largest strike in western Germany ended at midnight yesterday. However, union leaders announced today that unless German officials improve the rough food rationing system, the union will take more drastic action.

### United States Refuses Soviet Protest Against Use of North African Airfields

[U.S. News Service, Washington, 3rd] The State Department today published a response to the Soviet note regarding the U.S. use of the Manlaa airfield in Tripolitania, North Africa, and also revealed the contents of the Soviet ambassador's letter of January 21. The U.S. reply, dated February 3, was signed by Deputy Secretary of State Lovett, and stated, "The U.S. government wishes to point out that the agreement regarding the use of the Laha airfield by the U.S. Air Force will continue only during the period when the administrative bureau responsible for the territory exists. Under these circumstances, the U.S. government does not believe that this agreement is in conflict with Article 11 or other provisions of the Italian peace treaty.

### Hitler and His Mistress to be Tried In Absentia

[Reuters, Berlin, 4th] It is reported that the Nazi Purification Tribunal in Munich will soon try Hitler and his wife, Eva Braun, in absentia. Although it is rumored that they committed suicide in the air-raid shelter of the Berlin Chancellery on April 29, 1945, their bodies have never been found. According to legal experts from the U.S. military government, the purpose of conducting a trial in absentia is to determine the status of their property. If Hitler and Eva are found guilty, the court will order the confiscation of their property by the state, to be used as reparations to the Allied nations in the future. Other key Nazi war criminals, such as Göring, former Governor-General of Poland, Frank, former Governor of Bavaria, Streicher, former Minister of Economy, Funk, former Governor-General of the Netherlands, Seyss-Inquart, former Deputy Führer Hess, Bormann, and the Mayor of Vienna, Schirach, will also be prosecuted so that their property can be disposed of.

### UN Korean Commission Held Plenary Session Yesterday, Differing Opinions on Separate Elections in South Korea

[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 4th] The United Nations Korean Commission held a plenary session at Deoksugung Palace this morning at 10:00 AM, but no formal communiqué was issued after the meeting. A formal decision was made on personnel matters during today's meeting. The Indian representative, Menon, was re-elected as Chairman of the Korean Commission, and the daily chairmanship of the parliament will be rotated among representatives of various countries. In addition, the Chinese representative, Liu Yuwan, was nominated as the secretary of the Political Committee of the Commission.

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 4th] The United Nations Korean Commission now seems to be heading towards a showdown with the Soviet Union. Three representatives of the Commission urged in the plenary session this morning to hold elections in South Korea immediately, disregarding Soviet resistance. Of the four representatives who expressed their opinions in the plenary session, only one representative opposed holding elections in South Korea and advocated returning the entire issue to the United Nations General Assembly's Resident Committee for handling. The three countries advocating immediate elections in South Korea are China, France, and the Philippines. So far, only Syria has expressed opposition. It is reported that the Canadian representative also opposes holding elections in South Korea. However, the representative of El Salvador made undisclosed remarks stating that he would support holding elections in South Korea. With El Salvador supporting this position, the number of representatives supporting elections in South Korea will increase to four (note: the Commission has a total of eight representatives).

### North Korean Zhang Shangtie Mails Fail to Deliver

[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 3rd] This agency has learned from reliable sources that senior Soviet officials stationed in North Korea have received instructions to avoid any contact with the United Nations Commission responsible for organizing the Korean government. It is also learned that the Soviet liaison officer stationed in Seoul claimed that he had no authority to deliver Chairman Menon's letter from the United Nations Commission to the Soviet military commander in North Korea. According to reports, the liaison officer suggested to the Commission that the letter be sent from the Korean post office.

### Soviet Union Has Special Intentions in Training Korean Troops

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] Brigadier General Helmick, Deputy Commander of the US military government in Korea, told reporters in Washington on the 3rd that if the US withdraws from Korea, 250,000 Koreans trained by the Soviet Union in North Korea could immediately take over the entire country. South Koreans generally believe that the takeover of the entire country by these Koreans is only a matter of time. Helmick also said that the North Korean army has Japanese weapons, and some are experienced from participating in the Manchurian Communist war. Although South Korea also has Korean-organized troops and police forces, their strength is far inferior to the North Korean troops. Regarding the stalemate in US-Soviet negotiations on holding elections for a Korean parliament to establish a national democratic government, Helmick believes that it cannot be broken for the time being.

### US and Nepal to Establish Diplomatic Relations

[US Information Service, Washington, 3rd] The State Department announced today: "The United States and the Kingdom of Nepal will soon exchange ministers and enter into formal diplomatic relations. This important development follows the Treaty of Commerce and Friendship signed between the US and Nepal on April 25, 1947." The Nepalese government has recently appointed Marshal Rana as the minister to the United States. The current Nepalese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, General Kaiser, will concurrently serve as the Nepalese representative to Washington and London, residing in London.

### MacArthur's Directive that Purification of Hirano by the Japanese Supreme Court Remains Valid, District Court's Injunction to Stop Purification of Hirano Revoked

[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 4th] Chief Justice Mitsubuchi of the Japanese Supreme Court issued an important statement on the issue of Hirano's purification, stating: "Today, we received instructions from MacArthur's headquarters stating: 'The purification of不良份子 (undesirable elements) is based on the headquarters' instructions from the previous year, which is very clear. This matter is the direct responsibility of the Supreme Commander. The Japanese Prime Minister is merely acting on his authority. Therefore, the Japanese courts have no jurisdiction over events to judge whether one should be purged, hence the temporary disposition of the Tokyo District Court is regarded as an invalid judgement without jurisdiction.' The temporary disposition regarding the cessation of Hirano's purge naturally loses effect." The government's purge of Hirano remains effective. Currently, the opposition Liberal Party and the All-Farmers faction are planning to use the Hirano incident as an excuse to launch a no-confidence motion against the government in the House of Representatives.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] The heated dispute caused by the issue of purifying former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Hirano Rikizo came to an abrupt end today because the Supreme Court has invalidated the Tokyo District Court's injunction against the government's decision to purify Hirano.

"Quantitative" and "Qualitative" Dispute

The London Naval Conference was convened in 1935 and ended at the end of March 1936. President Roosevelt had a strong interest in the progress of the conference. From childhood, he had extensive experience with ships of all kinds. Even as a child, the naval vessels passing near the coast of New England particularly attracted his attention. When he came to Washington to serve as Secretary of the Navy in the Wilson administration, he was known for his proficiency in naval issues, tactics, facts, and management. By the time he left office, he had made a deep study of all important naval issues and was fascinated by the Navy.

When he took office as president, his knowledge of the navy was perhaps greater than that of any of his predecessors. Throughout his presidency, I found that he always gave priority to every issue related to the navy. Most of the more important decisions regarding naval affairs were made by him personally. At the London Naval Conference, the president demonstrated rare knowledge of the technical aspects. He was extremely qualified to discuss the merits of various developments belonging to the most technical aspects and to offer advice. Even the oldest and most experienced admirals had great respect for his profound knowledge of naval affairs.

In the telegrams I sent to the president and in our verbal discussions on the floor of the London Conference, we used the words "quantitative" and "qualitative" dozens or hundreds of times with regard to limiting naval armaments. The former refers to limiting total tonnage, and the latter refers to limiting the size of various ships and the caliber of the artillery positions. One day, the president ran out of patience. He shouted, "Quantitative, qualitative, quantitative, qualitative, I am tired of hearing these words. Can't we find some words to replace them?" But we couldn't find any.

On February 28, the President made a proposal for a naval treaty. He sent it to the State Department in the form of a memorandum, and then we used constant reports to send it to Norman Davis, the head of our delegation in London at the time. This proposal crystallized into a portion of the London Treaty and became one of the most important developments in the conference. The President said, "What do you think if we send a telegram to Davis, asking him to try to obtain a gentlemen's agreement from the UK, France, Italy (and, via the UK, from Germany) to the effect that every country agrees to notify the other countries when deciding to build any form of naval vessel of more than one hundred tons? If such a gentlemen's agreement could be obtained, then these four or five countries could unite or some of them could invite Japan to do the same."

The question of whether Germany should become a signatory to the treaty was a delicate one. On June 18, 1935, Britain and Germany signed an agreement stipulating that the German navy would be 35 percent of the Royal Navy. Because this figure was more than three times the naval strength Germany was allowed to maintain under the Treaty of Versailles, France and Italy lodged strong protests. For our part, we continued to be unwilling to make any representations, because the Anglo-German agreement was essentially about Europe and because we were not signatories to the Treaty of Versailles. When Britain suggested inviting Germany to the London Naval Conference, France stated that if Germany was invited to join, France and Germany must reach an agreement on the Rhineland issue, and Britain and France must reach an agreement on mutual assistance.

Hitler resolved the discussion of the Rhineland issue in a straightforward manner. German troops occupied the Rhineland on March 7, 1936, in violation of the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Pact. At that time, the London Conference was drafting the contents of the final agreement. The invasion of the Rhineland was a development in Europe that did not involve us, and Washington should not take any action. However, this was clearly another major step towards war. On March 9, I telegraphed Davis to ask him to express his views on the new situation in Europe and the various rumors or news that might involve the United States. I also said, "In any case, we are undoubtedly entering a period of increasing tension in the European situation."

By March 20, we had sent the final draft of the treaty to the president.

The President approved the treaty but made a suggestion. On March 20, we forwarded this suggestion to Davis, which said, "Davis should make it clear that the United States government and its representatives deeply regret the failure to stipulate restrictions on quantity (total tonnage) in the new treaty."

On March 23, I telegraphed the President's thoughts to Davis, that is, Davis and Admiral Stanley should jointly send a letter to Eden, the head of the British delegation, "expressing pleasure and gratitude for the interactions during the conference, and taking this opportunity to mention that the new treaty, like previous naval treaties, does not stipulate quantitative restrictions. Our government hopes to avoid competition with Britain in naval construction; the British Empire and the United States should accept the method of equal fleets as a recognized and established principle; the current situation and environment prove that the two governments should continue to adhere to the principle of equal fleets; adhering to this principle will help the friendly relations between the two governments and world peace." The British could respond in the same tone.

As soon as this matter was completed, news leaked immediately, and news of various "secret agreements" that Anglo-American naval cooperation had been established spread everywhere. Minister Wilson informed me from Geneva that this "leak" came from the Japanese observers attending the London Conference, who were at any time informed of confidential information by the British side. Therefore, we were prepared to publish these two letters together.

In April 1936, when Davis returned from London, he and I had a long conversation about the world situation. A major problem and responsibility were presented before us, which our government had to cope with. It involved a firm decision, namely, given the chaotic situation in many parts of the world, when should our country, in light of actual circumstances, abandon its attempts to maintain peace through disarmament and quickly begin to fully arm itself so as to resist the actions of Germany, Japan, and Italy, which were clearly heading towards military conquest?

For more than a decade, the world's tendency has been largely in the direction of disarmament. But in the last few years, we have seen Japan, Germany, and Italy's words and actions clearly reveal aggressive intentions. We have seen these countries violate all disarmament efforts and every treaty to maintain peace. At the same time, we have seen a mad and unrestrained arms race, coupled with the noise of conquest and shameless threats, and these aggressor nations are naturally the main actors in this.

When Davis and I discussed these developments, one thing was very clear: it was almost impossible to maintain peace through disarmament. So the question at the time was, could law-abiding countries make appropriate cooperation to contain the rapidly developing military aggression plans, and to what extent could they cooperate? But, as everyone knows, our government in fact had to ignore this possible method of maintaining peace for the simple reason that the majority of public opinion was strongly or even fiercely opposed to our participation in this type of joint action.

The only way for the United States, on the one hand, to continue to persuade and promote peace, urging countries—especially those determined to engage in aggression—to adopt similar policies, and, on the other hand, was to immediately pay attention to the actions of the aggressors and arm our country without further delay to a degree sufficient to protect our country's security.

In early 1935, I had already told the president my fervent belief that we should hurry to build a larger navy, especially for the situation in the Far East. On January 22, 1935, I sent him a memorandum, accompanied by an excellent report from Ambassador Grew in Tokyo, which analyzed the outlook of the East very clearly, and attached a memorandum drafted by the State Department on the Far East issue.

One section of the State Department's memorandum said: "We should intensify our efforts to have a navy so strong that no country dares to seriously think of attacking us; we should make it clear that our people, on the one hand, do not want to fight and have no reason to attack any other country, and, at the same time, are not only not too proud to fight, but, under certain conditions, will be too proud not to fight."

Some cabinet members were surprised that the Secretary of State would recommend building a navy. A friend of the President and I, Baruch, once said to me that the President was surprised that I was so eager to build a larger navy.

In 1935, I began planning how to accumulate tin, because tin is a military raw material that is not produced much in the United States and is necessary for the Army and Navy in the event of war. Vance, the State Department's economic advisor, and I drafted a plan together, and through him, I conveyed this idea to British Ambassador Lindsay and put the plan before him. The main point was that Britain should obtain a certain stipulated amount of tin and hand it over to our government, the price of which could be credited to the account of British debt owed to our country.

After studying the plan, Lindsay came to see me on June 6, 1935, and said that he had sent the proposal to London.

Lindsay's expression was extremely gloomy. He said that the British people believed that the debt had already been settled, and it would be difficult for the British government to obtain funds to pay for the transfer of tin to us.

I reminded the Ambassador that the main supply of tin in the world was under the control of the British capital. A small amount of payment in kind, as we suggested, could revive the previous symbolic method of debt repayment and conform to the spirit of this method. This was something the British government had been very happy to do before, until the unfortunate impact of the Johnson Act occurred, at which point it stopped. This action could have a good impact on the views of our people on the British government.

But Lindsay did not think that this suggestion would even be accepted by the British Foreign Office. He was right. The reply from London was a complete rejection. It was not until four years later, three month before the outbreak of the European war, that we were able to negotiate an agreement with Britain stipulating the exchange of cotton for rubber and tin. Only then did we begin to accumulate important military raw materials.

In fact, if the State Department's efforts could have yielded results as early and as fully as we had hoped, we could have been fully prepared when the war broke out at Pearl Harbor, which would have greatly reduced the wartime burden.

Most of them will be sent to the district prosecutor's office for interrogation in the short term. This reporter visited Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang yesterday and asked if he had any opinions on the above three cases. Chief Huang said: "Administrative agencies are deductive, while judicial agencies are inductive. It is necessary to wait until the case is transferred to the district prosecutor's office and synthesize various facts before a conclusion can be reached. Before seeing the police bureau's investigation report, it is impossible to express an opinion. As for how to handle each case in the future, evidence will be emphasized and handled according to law.

As for the deaths of the three female workers at the Shenxin No. 9 Factory, whether the police opened fire is still unknown. However, according to the "Regulations on the Use of Weapons," the police and military have the right to use weapons when suppressing disturbances and maintaining order when necessary, so it does not constitute a crime.

On January 7th of this year, when the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hanyang vessel arrived in this city from Hong Kong, Jianghai Customs inspectors Yang Zhicai and Jin Qingliang were dispatched to inspect the vessel. When they checked the side of the ship's doctor, Xin Afa, they found a package of gold bars, totaling 30 bars, with the larger ones weighing ten taels and the smaller ones weighing six taels. According to regulations, they should have been confiscated, but Wu Guozhang, the passenger who had smuggled the gold bars, stepped forward and privately negotiated with Yang and Jin, so they were not confiscated. Afterward, Wu rewarded Yang and others with nine gold bars, but Wu Guozhang later went back on his word and reported the matter to the Jianghai Customs authorities. Yang Zhicai and Jin Qingliang were immediately detained and transferred to the court for trial on charges of corruption. The case was first heard by the district court yesterday. However, according to the two defendants, the case was deliberately framed by the informant, Wu Guozhang. They accepted Wu's nine gold bars only because Wu pleaded bitterly. If all the gold bars were confiscated, they would have received a reward of nine gold bars, and so on. The court considered that the case still needed to be investigated and rescheduled the trial.

When asked by reporters about his impressions of Shanghai, he replied that the vast majority of students in Shanghai schools were able to recognize the importance of the school and were unwilling to easily sacrifice the opportunity to attend classes, as was the case with Tongji students, so he was pleased that the student movement could be resolved smoothly. At present, 90% of Tongji students are attending classes as usual, and the remaining 10% are students who took leave to return home to avoid trouble during the strike and will soon return to school. Furthermore, after his close contact with the presidents of various universities in Shanghai this time, he deeply felt the heavy responsibility and busy work of the university presidents, especially in solving the problem of rice, oil, salt, and firewood for faculty and students, which took a lot of effort. The presidents of the various schools are diligent and hardworking, and their spirit is admirable. All schools feel that their funding is insufficient, and Hang has decided to relay this to the Standing Committee and to generously raise education funds as much as possible. When asked by reporters about the punishment methods for the troublemakers in the Tongji student movement, Hang replied that a portion would be handed over to the court for trial, and another portion would be given appropriate punishment by the school authorities.

### It is Difficult for Factories Relocated Inland to Export; Hope the Government Will Continue to Support; Four Groups Issue a Declaration to Fight for Japanese Reparations Materials

The United Association of Factories Relocated to Sichuan and Guizhou, the United Association of Factories Relocated to Shaanxi, and the Post-War Private Cotton Mill Resumption Committee have repeatedly petitioned the relevant authorities to demand reparations for "the reparations materials". Now that the first batch of Japanese reparations materials has arrived in Shanghai and the government has set a price allocation method, a joint declaration has been issued to express their views. The original text is very long, and the general meaning is: "At a time when the industry is extremely shrinking, we believe that the result of the 'price allocation' of reparations materials, based on the government's experience in bidding for enemy and puppet factories and allocating post-war relief industrial and mining equipment at price, is nothing more than the following two points: First, there is a lack of applicants, which leads to the long-term storage and damage of materials. Second, speculators use it as a hoarding object, which increases the difficulty of industrial development and affects the social economy. However, if a part of the 'early reparations' can be given to the factories relocated inland, then there are talents and materials without emptiness, and it is hoped that the effect of maximizing the use of both can be achieved. Each factory does not need many materials, and the government's loss of current income is limited, but as a result, each factory can rely on it to continue production, and the government can also show encouragement. Weighing the gains and losses is also very well-considered. The methods are also easy to implement. The methods of 'early reparations' and preferential purchase for factories relocated inland have been jointly suggested to the government and are not difficult to implement. The 'account price allocation' method allows factories relocated inland to apply for price allocation first, but the price will be settled after the peace conference with Japan determines the amount of reparations, and then the losses of each factory are proportionally calculated. Even if the government can use a part of the price obtained from the price allocation to compensate us in advance, it is also possible to use it to resume business. To speak of justice is to maintain discipline and adjust the plan. To speak of gains and losses is to seek wealth and strength for the country. There are many feasible methods, and there are no real difficulties for the government. It is the utmost to consider things in a long-term perspective and to think in other people's shoes. However, after repeated practice, the understanding of the relevant authorities has not been obtained, and after waiting for several months, no practical and reasonable response has been received. Is it possible that the relevant authorities still have some unavoidable difficulties? It has been said to the authorities that, firstly, the Allied Powers' peace conference with Japan has not yet been opened, and the amount of reparations for each country has not been determined, so people's reparations cannot be handled. Secondly, the initial dismantling and relocation of reparations materials by Japan was originally intended to dismantle Japanese military industrial industries and was stipulated by the Far Eastern Commission that the criteria for Allied countries to apply for and allocate dismantling materials should be based on the conditions of being able to quickly utilize and supplement equipment. The handling of materials that our country requests and may obtain cannot but pay attention to the above standards in order to strive for priority in order to continue to claim compensation. The report said that the first batch of reparations materials are all working machine tools. According to the government's economic construction policy, the focus is on developing the textile industry, followed by the paper industry, the electrical appliance industry, and coal mines. All industries that manufacture or repair textile, paper, or electrical appliances and coal mines that increase coal production can request price allocation. Thinking about it, there are countless factories relocated inland that specialize in manufacturing the above types of machine tools and are famous in the country. The products that are still in use everywhere are everywhere. If the government can provide assistance today, it is confident that it can still do something. This is why we, even though we are in dire straits, still hope that our government can continue to support us with the enthusiasm it showed when assisting us in relocating inland. In short, we have nothing to hate and nothing to complain about today. In addition to seeking assistance from the highest authorities, we also want to tell the people of the country that our original intentions have not changed, there is no way to be effective, the situation is becoming more and more difficult, and the matter is becoming more and more urgent. The success or failure of individuals is a small matter, and the prosperity or decline of the country is a big matter. As a commoner, how can I allow myself to refuse responsibility? What I hope is that the gentlemen of the country will provide support and enlighten the authorities to give support, so that people can make the most of their talents and materials can be used to the fullest, to comfort loyalty and to prevent speculation. The country and society are fortunate."

### Six Drug Addicts Arrested in an Upstairs Gambling Den Transferred to the District Court for Trial; Claim that Red Light was for Burglar Prevention

[Reported by our newspaper] Tang Mujun, who operated in an upstairs gambling den at No. 463 Min Guo Road, installed a red electric light upstairs because he feared being caught by police detectives for opium use. The switch was installed downstairs. If he saw anyone suspicious, he would turn on the red light from downstairs to warn the addicts to hide their paraphernalia and escape through the side door. The Yimiao Police Precinct discovered this and sent police detectives to raid the place on the 28th of last month. Due to the suddenness of the raid, Tang did not have time to turn on the red light and was arrested. Five other suspects, including Zhang Huiqing, were found next to the opium bed. All were transferred to the Criminal Court of the District Court yesterday for trial. Judge Shao Renjie interrogated them. Tang admitted to using drugs, smoking about one mace (approximately 3.75 grams) of opium a day. However, he claimed that the red light was installed for burglar prevention because there was a safe upstairs. After the interrogation, Judge Shao ordered that Tang Mujun, Zhang Huiqing, and the other six be temporarily detained for further questioning at a later date.

### Xi'an Cracks Major Drug Smuggling Case; 138 Ounces of Morphine Seized; Two Masterminds Stayed in Beiping to Handle Goods

[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, February 2] At the end of the year, Xi'an suddenly cracked a drug smuggling case involving air transportation, seizing 138 ounces of morphine, estimated to be worth around 2 billion national currency. In the cold ancient city, this incident is sensational. Especially because it was transported by air from Beiping to Shaanxi, and with the residents' rumors and exaggerations, it became even more lively.

The facts are as follows: On the night of January 28, more than ten members of the 14th Regiment of the Military Police stationed in Xi'an and police and local security personnel knocked on the door of No. 13 Xiaoxuexi Alley (on West Street in Xi'an). The home was inhabited by a widow, Guo Chushi, who was from Wen County, Henan, and was nearly fifty years old. She had been in Shaanxi for four years. According to her neighbors, Guo Chushi usually made a living by weaving cloth. However, on the night that the police and military police arrived at her home, they indeed seized five bags of morphine on the spot, weighing 114 ounces. She was arrested along with the drugs.

On the same night, three people were arrested in Minsheng Market, the commercial center of Xi'an. These people were all using the guise of setting up cloth shops. One of them, Chu Haozhi, was Guo Chushi's cousin. Another criminal, Chu Qingxi, was also a member of her clan. Before their arrest, police officers searched their residence and seized a bag of morphine weighing 24 ounces. It is said that when the police arrived at Chu's residence, only Yu Pu Xi was at home. After questioning, he confessed that Chu Haozhi and a man named Guo Daoqing had gone to a brothel in the National Market and had not yet returned. Thereupon, the police rushed there and apprehended the two men. At the same time, two small packages of morphine samples were found on the two men.

The so-called Guo Daoqing was also a relative of the Guo clan, and was usually engaged in the same industry and relatives often visited each other. At that time, there were two guests, Xue Yi Lai and Xue De Li, who frequented the market. They were well-dressed and behaved like wealthy merchants. After the villagers observed their actions, they talked with them, and over time, they became close friends, calling each other brothers. However, the two Xue never spoke about their own family matters, and did not tell others about these things. Their relationship was entirely based on money and wine.

After becoming very close, the two Xue took the opportunity to talk to Chu and Guo about ways to get rich, saying that shipping opium from Beiping to Xi'an would bring huge profits. Each shipment would bring at least a double profit. Chu, Guo, and the others were aimed at getting rich, so they were naturally unwilling to let this opportunity pass. They were delighted by the Xue's巧言誘導, and immediately decided to pool their resources, with each share being 50 million yuan, for a total of 500 million national currency. The two Xue then flew to Beiping to purchase the first batch of drugs, which arrived before the New Year. According to the original decision, it was handed over to Guo's sister and brother for safekeeping.

The 14th Regiment of the Military Police had already obtained information when the first batch of drugs arrived. They originally wanted to arrest all of them after the two Xue had transported the second batch of drugs, but unexpectedly, after the 22nd of last month, the weather snowed, and the cold currents were pressing. Due to air pressure reasons, flights to and from Xi'an were temporarily suspended. The Military Police authorities were afraid that things would change over time, so they arrested Chu, Guo, and the other criminals first. (Another claim is that the criminals intended to transport this batch of drugs to Lanzhou, thus hastening the Military Police authorities' cracking of the case).

The four criminals and all of the seized drugs were transferred to the Xi'an Municipal Government, and the criminals and their confessions were transferred to the Chang'an District Court. The court opened its first trial on January 31. Guo Chushi told the judge that it was true that drugs were found in her residence, but these things were temporarily left at her home by a fellow villager, Xue Yilai, six or seven days earlier. She herself did not realize what they were at the time, so she did not pay attention. When asked where Xue himself was now, she claimed "I don't know." Chu Qingxi confessed that he was also in contact with Ji Qirong, and when he was arrested and taken to the market, he saw Ji Qirong flee, and the details are unknown.

This case has only developed to this point, and the Chang'an District Court will investigate according to the law. According to a Xi'an evening newspaper: "According to the person in charge of cracking the case: 'The case involves a wide range, and those who have escaped will be strictly arrested...'" (Reporter Zhang Zhou)

### Taiwan Provincial Camphor Company; Leakage from Main Oil Pipe Causes Loss of More Than Four Tons

[Reported from Taipei, February 3] According to the person in charge of the Nanmen Factory, which belongs to the Taiwan Provincial Camphor Company: On the morning of the 18th of last month, it was suddenly discovered that the intermediate oil stored in the oil tank (that is, the intermediate oil from which camphor has been extracted) was leaking from the main pipe and flowing into Yongchun Stream. The person in charge of the factory immediately directed employees to actively filter it. After the incident, it was investigated that more than four tons had been lost, and the matter was reported to the relevant authorities for investigation.

### Li Zongren, Director of the Beiping Executive Headquarters, Runs for Vice President

Li Zongren, who once created the unprecedented victory in the history of the War of Resistance at Taierzhuang and is the current Director of the Beiping Executive Headquarters, will run for Vice President at the National Assembly meeting on March 29 of this year after the implementation of the Chinese Constitution, at the urging of various parties. Li's achievements in revolutionary history and his political experience are highly praised by foreign public opinion. Li can be said to be an extremely suitable person to assist the President with outstanding military and political abilities. The following is a brief biography of Li: Li Zongren, courtesy name Delin, is 57 years old this year and is from Guangxi. Early in his schooling, he joined the revolutionary organization led by Sun Yat-sen. After graduation, he devoted himself to revolutionary battles and was wounded twice. From 1919 to 1921, he suppressed the remnants of Guangxi warlords. In 1922, he was appointed by Sun Yat-sen as the Guangxi Pacification Commissioner. In 1923, he defeated the rebel armies of Lu Rongting, Liu Zhenhuan, Shen Hongying, and others, laying the foundation for the revolution in Guangdong and Guangxi. In the autumn of that year, Li sent personnel to meet with Tang Jiyao, introducing Tang to join the revolutionary army. In the autumn of 1924, President Chiang led troops on the Northern Expedition, and Li was appointed commander of the 7th Army, which was invincible and known as the "Steel Army". In the Battle of De'an, he defeated Sun Chuanfang's main force. After the National Army entered Nanjing, Sun Chuanfang fiercely attacked Longtan, relying on Li to lead his troops in a bloody battle for seven days and nights, annihilating Sun's army. The National Government then established its capital in Nanjing.

In the spring of 1926, the government reorganized the army, establishing four military groups, with President Chiang, Yan Xishan, Feng Yuxiang, and Li serving as commanders-in-chief, respectively. Li was stationed in Wuhan, serving as chairman of the political branch. At that time, communist bandits in Hunan and Hubei rebelled, and Li's command was well-organized and quickly suppressed them. In 1928, Li led his troops back to Guangxi, determined to carry out construction, with great success. Both China and foreign countries響廣西爲中國模範省. Li's political talents were thus increasingly admired by the Chinese people. After the September 18 Incident, Li advocated resistance against Japan, and his "Scorched Earth Resistance Theory" was widely praised at the time. In 1937, when the War of Resistance broke out, Li and Bai Chongxi were summoned to Nanjing. After the evacuation of Shanghai and Nanjing, Li was stationed in Xuzhou as Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth War Zone. In the Battle of Taierzhuang, he annihilated the elite enemy troops of the Isogu and Itagaki divisions, enabling the National Army to部　武漢外國坚强之防务, and at the same time established the belief among people throughout the country that victory in the War of Resistance was certain. Chinese and foreign public opinion 成对. Mr. Biao praised the battle experience, resulting in盛誉. In the following seven years, Li led his troops in combat, repeatedly making outstanding achievements. After the victory, Li served as the Director of the Beiping Executive Headquarters until today.

### Supervision and Conscription Committee Sends Personnel to Investigate; Changzhou Tianfeng Rice Mill Embezzles Air Force Grain

[Reported from Wujin, February 2] Tianfeng Rice Mill in Xinqiao Street, this county, is one of the contract warehouses of the Field Grain Department. Recently, a conscription officer from the old Fourth District transported more than 150 bags of grain to the mill, but the mill did not issue a seven-part receipt as required, only a warehouse receipt, which prevented the officer from receiving 清串 at the Field Grain Department, causing a joke. It then embezzled more than 1,000 piculs of Air Force grain. The officer was anxious and tried to clear up the matter. It is reported that the Supervision and Conscription Committee sent personnel to investigate and found that the equipment was rudimentary. After checking the accounts and according to the warehouse report, there was still a shortage of more than 500 piculs. Dai Tiandao, the manager of the department, made excuses and was in Shanghai, avoiding seeing anyone, while his assistant答稱: the missing grain was on its way in Wuhu. Liu Yanyun, the resident factory officer sent by the Field Grain Department, did not often stay in the factory and also did not handle matters properly.

### Pingjiang Gold Cave Successfully Trials Production of Gold Liquid

[Our Changsha, 31st (by airmail) report] The Pingjiang Gold Cave Mining Project in Hunan province has successfully trial-produced gold liquid, a substance widely used for decorating porcelain paintings and vessels for aesthetic purposes. In the past, China relied solely on imported products, resulting in substantial annual financial losses. In an effort to trial-produce gold liquid to reclaim these lost profits, Director Pan Zheng Gang of the project sought and obtained approval from the Provincial Department of Construction to establish a laboratory. Chemical engineer Shen Mingyang was appointed to lead the experiments. After dozens of dedicated trials, they finally achieved success on the 21st of last month, and the color and luster of the product are indistinguishable from imported goods. The project has dispatched a specialist to present the trial-fired samples to the Construction Department for inspection and approval. They have also submitted a budget request to establish a factory for large-scale production to meet market demand. Upon receiving the report, the Construction Department commended Director Pan Zheng Gang and Engineer Shen Mingyang for their contribution to the nation by successfully producing gold liquid, curbing financial losses, and reducing the need for foreign exchange. Regarding the request to establish a factory for large-scale production, the department has instructed them to submit a detailed report on the experimental gold liquid production method, the uses of gold liquid, sales channels, and cost calculations for further review and approval.

### Hong Kong Merchants Seeing Out the Year

[Our Hong Kong, 1st (by airmail) report] The second snowfall in a century has brought the end of the lunar year Dinghai to Hong Kong. Although it is a bustling cosmopolitan city, most merchants here are still quite traditional. They are rushing to settle old accounts and see off the end of the year. When they talk about the year that is coming to a close, most of them shake their heads with bitter smiles, lamenting, "In decades, it hasn't been as bleak as this year!" It is said that the industrial raw material trading companies and the north-south trading companies dealing in seafood and sundry goods, which usually make a lot of money, have suffered particularly heavy losses. Only the hardware and paper businesses can be said to be barely stable.

Around the end of the year, social news has also been full of incidents. The extradition case of Xu Jizhuang has just passed, and the "Guangdong" transport ship running between Guangzhou and Hong Kong suddenly caught fire on the 31st of last month. Although only a small part of the main cabin was burned, passengers (mostly small-scale smugglers carrying New Year's goods to the province for the market) were eager to escape, and over thirty women, children and weak were pushed into the water and drowned. Last year, at the same time, there was also a tragic fire on the "Xi'an" ship, which killed and injured more than a hundred people. It's only four days away from the anniversary of the "Guangdong" fire. This unfortunate incident has attracted great attention from the transportation authorities. In the past, ships were the most important means of transportation between Hong Kong, and merchants gathered there. Now, with frequent accidents, everyone regards it as a dangerous route.

From today onwards, Hong Kong rickshaw pullers are ordered to wear uniforms, with the number of the rickshaw sewn on the clothing, and their hair must be cut short to show cleanliness. It is said that this is a measure taken by the police to facilitate the management of rickshaw pullers and to beautify the city. (Special Correspondent Shi Jian)

### "Two-Faced Informer" Arrested in Wuxi

[Our Wuxi, 2nd report] Zhi Yiyi, a "naturally intelligent" villager from the eighth district of Subei!, had been working for the bandits there. During the period when the National Army recovered the area, he immediately joined the Kuomintang, becoming a two-faced person. Last year, he suddenly secretly came to Wuxi and lived in Peijing Town, wearing a yellow military uniform and pretending to be an active-duty soldier. He colluded with a companion and a police student to extort money from wealthy households who had fled from the bandit-controlled areas to Wuxi, or from "independent" boats. Over the past year, he has committed numerous crimes. Recently, the Ministry of National Defense issued an arrest warrant for him. Unexpectedly, at the end of last month, Zhi and his accomplice were extorting money from two boatmen from Subei, Zong Dechun and Shi Wensi, under the Wu Bridge. Because their plan was not well-conceived, Zhi and his accomplice were arrested and interrogated.

### Miniature News

### Chen Zhenshan, Secretary of the County Assembly in Chenggu County, Southern Shaanxi, Assassinated; County Magistrate Meng Ruodong and Others Suspected and Detained

[Our Baoji, 1st (by airmail) report] Last year was a difficult year for southern Shaanxi. The Zhen'an massacre shocked the whole country, and County Magistrate Sun Junbo is still in jail. Before the New Year, Chen Zhenshan, the secretary of the county assembly in Chenggu County, was assassinated. Although this incident happened a month ago, because Chenggu is far away from Xi'an, most people are still unaware of it.

At 9 pm on December 22nd last winter, Chen Zhenshan, the secretary of the Chenggu County Assembly, was assassinated in his residence. According to the investigation by the Chenggu County Police Department, there were seven or eight perpetrators, wearing yellow woolen uniforms. One of them shouted, "My name is Wu Zhen." It is said that Chen's residence was in the center of the county seat.

Chen Zhenshan was the secretary of the county assembly, and it is said that he had a good relationship with the county party headquarters. He was able to take the post of secretary of the county assembly mostly due to the assistance of the party headquarters. Several months before Chen's death, he once united with the county assemblymen, with himself taking the lead, to accuse County Magistrate Meng Ruodong of misappropriating 1.3 billion yuan, which greatly offended County Magistrate Meng. On the night of the tragedy, County Magistrate Meng went to the countryside to inspect construction work, accompanied by Yu Xianzhou, the person in charge of the county youth corps, and the local public security chief. Therefore, after the incident, there was speculation that County Magistrate Meng and Officer Yu's departure might have something to do with the case.

According to Chen's wife, when she reported the incident to the police department after the tragedy, she said, "Her husband lamented the bad environment in Chenggu before he was killed, and told her that someone wanted to harm him, and the masterminds were County Magistrate Meng Ruodong and Yu Xianzhou, the leader of the Youth Corps." As for what grievances Chen had with the two, general rumors revolved around the issue of stances. Because Chen was a party figure, he would of course help his own stance and friends during the general election, and therefore was deeply resented.

### Suspects Arrested, Eleven Witnesses Summoned for Questioning

After the incident, the Sixth District Commissioner's Office of Shaanxi Province immediately launched an investigation and arrested suspects. Those who were taken into custody included Luo Tianhe, section chief of the Chenggu Police Department, Lian Cheng, the captain of the security police team, Officer Yu, conscription officer Lei Ming, and Officer Yu himself. County Magistrate Meng was also detained in the Nanzheng Commissioner's Office. While Lei Mingxing, Yu's guard, was being escorted from Chenggu to the Nanzheng Local Court, he allegedly confessed to himself, "Killing someone must be paid for with one's life!" It was originally said that the statement was unfounded, but with these remarks and actions after the fact, the subtle clues inevitably remind people of those rumors.

On the 17th of last month, the Nanzheng Local Court opened its first preliminary hearing to collect evidence and question the reasons, and summoned eleven witnesses, including the chief, inspector, police chief, and police officers from the Chenggu Police Department. In these people's statements, most of them revealed that the case was in fact related to those who had been detained.

The chief of the police department said, "Luo Tianhe and Lian Cheng were both bodyguards that County Magistrate Meng brought with him. County Magistrate Meng had previously established an "action team," and Luo, Lian, and a team member named Wang Wende were the main members of the team. Now, Wang Wende has disappeared." The guard on duty on the night of the incident also said that he had seen Luo Tianhe and Wang Wende wandering around Chen's residence before the incident occurred. After the incident, Luo returned to the police station, looking uneasy. Later, the police station received an anonymous letter containing the sentence: "The killer is evil, and the killed is also evil!" Luo Tianhe had also unintentionally said these two sentences in the office. As for Lian Cheng, he was originally the captain of the security police team, but he had never been to the team. However, on that night, he unexpectedly made an exception and returned to the team, and it is said that he was pale-faced and behaved abnormally.

In this day of constitutional government, the occurrence of this incident is unfortunate. However, the law is dignified and must not be let off. While the Shaanxi Provincial Government has had the court accept this case, it has sent personnel to assist the court in investigating the case. In the near future, the truth will surely come out and be revealed. (Reporter Qingmu)

The testimony of the police inspector, one of the witnesses, is important. He testified that two things were worth noting: 1. County Magistrate Meng and Chen Zhenshan had grievances over unpaid funds, and although Luo and Lian had no grievances with Chen, they were the county magistrate's personal bodyguards. 2. Although the rumors among the people of Chenggu are not enough to serve as evidence, clues may be heard from the rumors, so please pay attention to this point.

### Jiao Tong University's Metalworking Factory Building to be Constructed by Ministry of Education

[Shenzhou News Agency] Since Cheng Xiaogang took over as president of National Jiao Tong University in this city, he has actively added and restored equipment for various departments. According to the Ministry of Education, Dr. Qian Linzhao was previously commissioned to go to the United States to purchase approximately three million US dollars worth of educational equipment and materials from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for distribution to major colleges and universities across the country that had been damaged by the war. Among them, the university can preferentially allocate equipment for science and engineering, including the first batch of AC generators, transformers, rectifiers, etc. In addition, Jiao Tong University can obtain three drilling machines, one gear cutting machine, three grinders, five lathes, three milling machines, and one shaping machine from the first batch of Japanese reparations, which are currently on their way to Shanghai. The Department of Electrical Engineering has also applied to the Ministry of Education for US funds to purchase generators, motors, microwave oscillators, electrical analyzers, and other items. The Ministry of Transportation has subsidized 130 million yuan to the Department of Physics for the purchase of a large number of instruments from American and domestic manufacturers. Jiao Tong University originally had a small-scale metalworking factory before the war to manufacture various experimental instruments and specially designed instruments. Now, various lathes, shaping machines, drilling machines, etc., have been transported around during the war and are now so corroded that they are unusable. The Ministry of Education has now drafted a plan to first construct a factory building on campus after the various mechanical equipment has been supplemented and organized, and then hand it over to the university to receive it as a factory building.

### China Education Research Association is an Illegal Organization; Pretends to Help Students But Has Other Intentions; Municipal Education Bureau Decides to Strictly Ban It

[Central News Agency] After the Municipal Education Bureau exposed the inside story of the so-called "Shanghai Secondary Education Research Association's examination and sending of free students," the association suddenly published an advertisement yesterday in an attempt to confuse the public. A spokesperson for the Education Bureau issued another statement as follows: It has been verified that the "Shanghai Secondary Education Research Association" has not been registered with the Social Affairs Bureau and is originally an illegal organization. Most secondary school teachers and staff do not know about this organization, which is obviously a small number of people trying to use the name of the organization as a cover for political activities, and using free education as a slogan to use students as tools for their political activities. The government loves young people and encourages and helps poor students, and has already made every effort to do so. In addition to the municipal council stipulating free places, which the Bureau has ordered schools to comply with, it has also raised scholarships from social organizations, and planned funding methods. All private secondary schools also deeply understand this idea, and fully cooperate. Regarding the provision of free places, everyone can handle them in accordance with regulations, and there are absolutely no dissenting opinions among the faculty and staff. The "Secondary Education Research Association" itself has no preparation for free funds, but it has come up with the idea of ​​taking the power to allocate the free quotas of various schools, and sending people to various schools to coerce them to donate free quotas, and the association will send students to study. The Bureau has repeatedly received reports from various schools that the established free quotas are already regulated, so there is no need to ask the association to handle them. The association is generous with others' money and asks for it to be stopped. In the past, a very small number of schools did not understand the facts and allowed the association to send some students within the original free quotas, but after the Bureau exposed their inside story, they have withdrawn one after another. After comprehensively verifying the reports from all parties, it is determined that the association is organized by a small number of unruly people and is definitely not dedicated to helping students. Reading the advertisement published yesterday, it actually involves teachers' lives, in-kind distributions, year-end welfare, etc., which is becoming more and more irrelevant, and its conspiracy to have other intentions is becoming more and more obvious. In order to implement the consistent purpose of comprehensively managing and providing assistance to students, the Bureau has decided on its established policy to strictly ban the association and investigate its responsible persons. At the same time, it still strictly orders all schools to widely establish free quotas in accordance with regulations, in order to benefit poor students, and the scholarship unified review committee will give each school more scholarship places for poor students, so that every poor student in the city has the opportunity to go to school. Public and private schools, all sectors of society, and municipal authorities in this city have made the greatest efforts to solve the problem of students dropping out of school, which can be said to be meticulous. The "Secondary Education Research Association" does not raise funds or spend a penny, and uses the slogan of sending free students. Isn't it the most ridiculous and deceptive thing? It is hoped that students and all sectors of society can deeply understand this.

### Promoting Sports in Hong Kong; Chinese Sports Association Reorganized; Eleven Groups Serve as Basic Members; Representatives Pass Amended Constitution

[Our Hong Kong Report] The Hong Kong Branch of the Chinese Sports Association (CSA) was previously unable to bring together various sports organizations due to constitutional issues, and its work in promoting sports could not proceed smoothly. Later, with the efforts of Mr. Chen Rongbai, a sports enthusiast, the outgoing chairman finally agreed, and Yan Chengkun announced his resignation. The five original members, South China Athletic Association, Chinese YMCA, Chung Sing Benevolent Society, Chinese Recreation Club, and Taikoo Recreation Club, agreed to amend the constitution, abolish the grading of associations joining the CSA, and invite Sing Tao SC, Kitchee SC, Eastern AA, Kwong Wah AA, China Motor Bus Co. FC, and the Chinese Athletic Association (CAA), six new associations, to join the CSA on equal terms. The CSA then used these eleven units, new and old, as basic members.

At the same time, it was decided that in the future, football organizations (Football League), basketball organizations (Basketball League), etc., would not have department heads. Each association would only join the leagues, and the leagues would elect representatives to participate in the work of the CSA. Chen Rongbai consulted with the heads of each association based on these principles, and the eleven units agreed to join, realizing a great unity. Chen Rongbai then successfully retired.

During the organizational transition period, Chung Chi-keung was elected as chairman, Shih Chun-tat as secretary, and Ho King-bo as treasurer. The office location will be at the YMCA.

With these principles in place, the CSA held its first representative meeting at the YMCA on the evening of January 28th. The following organizations were represented: South China Athletic Association: Ho King-bo, Luk Yan-king; Chinese YMCA: Shih Chun-tat, Chung Chi-keung; Sing Tao Sports Club: Chan Mong-yan; China Motor Bus Co. FC: Tin Lei-shui Hung, Yeung Wing; Eastern Athletic Association: Wu Cho-kin, Sze Pu-wai; Kwong Wah Athletic Association: Tong Suen-hing, Lau Tin-king; Kitchee SC: Tsang Keng-hong; Chinese Athletic Association: Yip Tong, Yip Kau-ko; Chung Sing Benevolent Society: Lo Kwok-min; Taikoo Recreation Club: Lam Chung-; Chinese Recreation Club: Shum Tao-cheung.

The following resolutions were passed on the spot: 1. Regarding the amendment of the constitution, seven people were selected to be members of the constitution amendment committee. The following were selected: Lo Kwok-min, Luk Yan-king, Yip Kau-ko, Shih Chun-tat, Tin Lei-shui Hung, Wu Cho-kin, Poon Yau-shing, responsible for completing the drafting of the "Principles of Joint Organization" and amending the military system in the shortest possible time. 2. The staff members during the transition period will remain in their positions, with Chung Chi-keung responsible until the completion of the CSA's organization and the re-election. Although this is a step in the military construction of the CSA, it can also be said that this is a major event in Hong Kong sports this year.

### Bank of China's Overseas Remittances Revenue Exceeded 190 Billion Last Year

[Our Newspaper Report] The overseas remittances received by the Bank of China in December of the 36th year amounted to 40,904,218,198.30 yuan, of which 27,297,039,450.00 yuan came from New York and 9,838,646,334.30 yuan came from London, with the remaining amount coming from various ports in Southeast Asia. The national currency figure for overseas remittances in December was more than double that of November and ranked first among all months of last year. However, if converted into US dollars at the exchange rate, the overseas remittances in March ranked first, when the exchange rate was 12,000 yuan per US dollar. If calculated based on the March standard, the overseas remittances in December should have been over 100 billion, but now it is only over 40 billion, which is actually a significant decrease. The reason for the decrease is that the official exchange rate is quite different from the black market rate.

Overseas remittances are extremely important to the balance of international payments, and the government has always attached great importance to them. The Bank of China, which handles overseas remittances, has made every possible effort within its responsibilities, but in recent years, the results have not been as expected and have been decreasing day by day. The total overseas remittances received by the Bank of China throughout the year (36th year) amounted to only 190,007,904,532.82 yuan. January was 1,678,059,435.47 yuan, February was 8,275,745,552.46 yuan, March was 20,748,110,251.63 yuan, April was 20,271,587,804.50 yuan, May was 10,536,666,731.36 yuan, June was 3,843,290,734.95 yuan, July was 1,737,681,234.50 yuan, August was 8,928,804,166.90 yuan, September was 21,235,537,368.12 yuan, October was 34,616,974,458.64 yuan, November was 7,309,228,576.60 yuan, and December was 40,904,218,198.30 yuan.

### Shanghai Stock Market Situation Unclear; Government Bonds and Foreign Stocks Stable

### Silver Shops in the City Actively Handling Registration; Can Resume Business After the Lunar New Year

[Our Newspaper Report] The various silver shops in the city are being re-registered and reviewed by the Social Affairs Bureau and can resume business after the Lunar New Year. The industry's labor union has decided to publish an advertisement today to notify all silver shop employees who have been laid off to register with the union. The union will then gather them and send them to the industry association for selection and employment, with the hope of standardizing wages and working hours.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] According to news from the Ministry of Finance, the buying and selling of gold ornaments by silver shops is not prohibited as long as it does not violate the regulations on the management of the collection, exchange, and manufacture of gold ornaments by silver shops. Recently, the Ministry of Finance, considering that Article 4 of the original regulations only provides a general provision regarding the exchange of gold ornaments, has made slight revisions. The original gold needed for the manufacture of gold ornaments by silver shops should still be limited to being recycled from exchanged gold ornaments or entrusted by customers to convert their original gold. The government has not considered supplying original gold to silver shops.

### Excessive Commodity Tax Amount; Cement Association Provides Opinions to the Tax Bureau

[Our Newspaper Report] The National Cement Association previously stated that the amount of commodity tax on cement for the first period of this year was set too high, and various factories could not afford it. They had telegraphed the Tax Administration and other departments, requesting a reduction. Yesterday, the association submitted three points to the relevant authorities of the Tax Bureau, requesting their adoption. The main points are recorded as follows: The Tax Administration's view that the tax amounts for neighboring regions should be consistent is considered by the association to be inconsistent with the actual situation. The association believes that the actual situation does not match because the selling prices in the two regions do have differences due to market supply and demand. Therefore, the tax amount should be assessed separately based on the actual wholesale prices in each region. The Tax Administration believes that the tax amount should be calculated based on the market wholesale price. However, there are usually two types of wholesale prices for goods: one is the factory wholesale price at which the factory sells to wholesalers, and the other is the wholesale price at which wholesalers sell to retailers. The nature of the two is different. To determine a reasonable tax amount, the standard for wholesale price should first be established. The association may be tasked with providing reliable figures for cement factory wholesale prices on a regular basis as a basis for adjusting the tax amount. When setting the tax rate, the actual situation of various industries should be taken into account, and efforts should be made to ensure that the amount is reasonable. Otherwise, the actual effect of the tax increase will not be achieved, and the manufacturers' ability to bear the burden will have been exhausted first.

### Various Yarn Factories Request Joint Cotton Purchase; Yarn Tube Association Has Considered It; And Assists in Solving the Problem of Purchasing Machinery and Materials

[Our Newspaper Report] In order to understand our cotton needs, the relevant departments of the American Embassy invited Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the China Textile Construction Company, and Zhang Sili, Deputy Director of the Business Department, to meet and discuss the matter. They inquired in detail about the company's cotton inventory, cotton needs, and types of cotton needed. It is said that the information from the discussion will be used as a reference for the United States to supply cotton to us.

### Yarn Prices Rise Sharply, Cloth Prices Follow

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was characterized by relaxed credit among traders, and the Textile Construction Company did not announce prices several times, so various parties absorbed heavily, and the number of chips became increasingly scarce. In addition, the sellers held firm, and market prices rose sharply. The price of 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn broke through the 60 million yuan mark midway, reaching a high of 62 million yuan. Near the close, many floating profits were taken, and the result was 61.7 million yuan, a further increase of 2.8 million yuan compared with the previous day. Jin Cheng also rose sharply by 3 million yuan. Due to the significant losses of the Shenxin factory, those covering short positions for 11-count horse spot yarn rose one after another, ending at a new high price. Other counts of combed fine yarn also rose in unison, from 1 million to 2.78 million.

[Our Newspaper Report] The China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, selling a total of 112 bales, equivalent to 221 bales of 20-count yarn. There were 50 applications, and the 20 large airships sold for 34.75 million yuan, reaching the price limit.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw active buying from new customers in the morning, and there was also absorption in the local market. Brokers mostly focused on purchasing warehouse receipts. Among various cloths, fine cloth was particularly favored by buyers. Northern traders absorbed trumpet boy fine cloth outside the market. As a result, 12-pound fine cloth of various brands rose by 45,000 to 67,000 yuan compared with the previous day. In addition, the quoted prices for plain straight cloth, bleached cloth, twill cloth, colored cloth, and shilin cloth also showed progress.

Active Spot Cotton

Yesterday, the spot cotton market continued to be firm. Due to the sharp rise in cotton yarn, Rong Zhong saw a surge in demand. Sellers held firm, and transactions were stalled. Credit among non-industry players was generally loose, and scattered buyers absorbed the market, pushing prices up by 100,000 yuan, with 494 bales changing hands. The factory delivery price for Hankou coarse lint was 4.6 million yuan, and the warehouse delivery price for Hankou fine lint was 5.332 million yuan, Hankou coarse lint was 4.53 million yuan, and the price for Zhoupu cottonseed was 1.27 million yuan.

### Rayon Continues to Rise, Factory Management Exhausted and Unable to Revive

Yesterday, the rayon market continued to rise. 120-count Asahi brand glossy rayon opened in the morning at around 84.5 million yuan. Market sentiment was good, and buying interest was not weak. The market closed at 80 million yuan at noon, and then rose again in the afternoon, once reaching 91 million yuan. Finally, the selling price was quoted at 90 million yuan, a sharp increase of 5 million yuan compared with the previous day.

The factory silk market fell again yesterday, and the market was exhausted and unable to revive. C-grade silk was traded at 87 million yuan, with a two- or three-day premium. High-grade spot silk was 5 million yuan, medium-grade spot silk was 3 million yuan, and the next grade was around 1 million yuan. Dry silk had no transactions, and the quoted price fell accordingly.

The silk market was firm and stable yesterday. Strong raw silk quilt covers rose first and then fell back. At the opening, transactions of 1 million yuan and 100,000 yuan each were made, and then they immediately fell, with the smallest drop falling within the 40 million yuan mark, to 9.6 million yuan. The market closed slightly higher, with a quoted price of 40 million yuan. At the opening, Big Cheng checkered crepe was quoted at 167,000 yuan and was in demand. Later, the first high price of 850,000 yuan was traded. Other goods had clear transactions, and prices were quite firm.

### Twenty-Nine Kinds of Hardware and Other Items; Pricing and Distribution Based on CIF

The China Trust Bureau recently released a message stating that the Committee for Reviewing Self-Prepared Foreign Exchange Arrival Goods has decided on the issue of how to price and distribute the supplementary hardware items based on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) price. A total of twenty-nine kinds are included, including anchors, pig iron and iron bricks, scrap iron, copper, lead wire, ribbed steel, various small nails and screws, and metal products listed in Zhu's list. The markups range from a minimum of 40% to a maximum of 100%, with steel pipes being 110%.

It is also understood that if there are different CIF prices for the same type of goods, and the difference is too large, merchants can apply for purchase and distribution based on the reasonable CIF price of similar goods after providing proof.

### Sericulture Industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Hope for Cost-Based Purchase of Factory Silk

[Our Newspaper Report] Silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have jointly requested the Sericulture Industry Association of the Three Districts to convene a members' meeting, demanding that the Silkworm Cocoon Association purchase factory silk based on the actual cost of silk merchants and fulfill its promise of guaranteeing principal and interest. In the spring of the 36th year, the government stipulated that each dan of fresh cocoons should be calculated at the price of four shi of rice. In the autumn, it was rigidly stipulated that each dan should be 1.08 million yuan. At that time, silkworm farmers were unwilling to sell the full amount due to cost considerations, and most manufacturers had to increase the price appropriately to maintain the silkworm farmers' capital, so they secretly subsidized a great deal, which the authorities also knew early on. The fuel allocated by the Coordination Association was insufficient for use in each hall, and they all sought it on the black market, increasing costs. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, various factories need funds urgently. They hope that the Coordination Association will pay and hire according to the actual cost. Otherwise, they are willing to return the loans and recover the raw silk they handed over for free trade.

### Store Sales are Brisk, Rice Reappears Strong

Yesterday, a total of more than 8,300 shi of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. With snow fluttering, store sales were brisk, and the market was lively, regaining strength. Nong rice increased sharply by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, and Baiyuan also rose by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The ups and downs were entirely due to weather conditions. The same was true for flour, which also rose slightly by 30,000 to 50,000 to 10,000 yuan. There were still many bran supplies, and the market was flat and stable, lacking the power to rise.

Bean cake sales were active among retail customers, rising by 10,000 yuan. Soybean oil factories absorbed the market, and customers inquired. The local market was dry and fragrant, turning from weak to strong, rebounding by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Soybeans were firm in the customer's mind, rising by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Red beans were sold firmly by sellers, rebounding by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Silkworm beans were selling blandly, with little activity in the market.

Red sorghum was firm. Northern corn sales were brisk, with strong buying interest, rising sharply by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Sesame sales were sporadic and active, rebounding by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Black sesame remained flat and stable. Raw peanuts were replenished by local businesses, and transactions were lively, turning from weak to strong, rebounding by 60,000 to 100,000 yuan.

The oil market strengthened, and the market situation rose. Soybean oil rose by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil also increased by 70,000 to 80,000 yuan. Clear oil also rose by 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Raw oil rose rapidly by more than 100,000 yuan, becoming slightly weak near the close.

Reissuance of Tobacco Leaf Tax Certificates

Not Approved by the Ministry of Finance

The Shanghai Tobacco Leaf Trade Association stated that the quantity of tobacco leaves destroyed in Xuchang by various tobacco leaf merchants was considerable, and the losses were enormous. The destroyed tobacco leaves had all been subject to commodity tax. In order to compensate for the huge losses, they had previously submitted a document to the Commodity Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, stating that the tobacco leaves had not yet been shipped out of the country and requesting assistance. The original tax certificates should continue to be used, and the destroyed stamps and tax certificates should be reissued. It is now learned that the industry association received a reply from the Tax Department, stating that according to tax law, tax certificates can only be used once, and destroyed stamps and certificates should be invalidated, and reissuance is not allowed, so the request should not be considered. The industry association will submit another application.

### Domestic Tea Firm

Yesterday, sellers in the tea market still held the idea of speculating and selling at high prices due to the shrinking inventory of various goods, which was greater than in the past. However, due to the narrow buying capacity of exporters, the process of export tea was quiet. As for domestic sales of various types of tea, the local market and customer's purchases continued unabated, and the buying momentum continued in both directions. In this situation, prices moved straight forward, and by the close, they had all risen compared to the previous closure.

### Export Control Conference Discuss Trade Controls

The Export and Import Management Committee held a meeting in the morning, presided over by Chairman Huo himself. It is understood that Chairman Huo is paying close attention to the current trade control system and will propose a concrete revision method in the short term. It is said that the most important aspects of the current trade control are three: How to make the technicalities of limited import allocation more reasonable; How to make the review of non-quota imports more appropriate; How to effectively implement export certification. The Export and Import Management Committee is also paying attention to whether to open up self-prepared foreign exchange. The official has denied reports that the government will revise its import and export policy, saying that the government is currently strengthening the control of existing policies, and it is impossible to make major changes to the current control policies. As for the parent-child export linkage, the official believes that it is difficult to implement because the government's foreign exchange revenue will lack sources after the linkage.

### Essentials of Indian History

— Lu Yuan

Edited by Li Zhichun, published by Zhengzhong Bookstore

India is adjacent to our country, and both have the reputation of being ancient civilizations. Whether in the past or present, India shares many similarities with our country in history. The exchange between Chinese and Indian cultures started earlier than with any other country. According to Chinese books, cultural exchange between China and India began more than two thousand years ago. In these two thousand years, the two countries have always maintained friendly relations without any hostility, which is a rare phenomenon in world history.

In recent years, the relationship between China and India has become increasingly close. We are concerned about the development of the situation in India, and Indian people are equally concerned about our China. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chairman Chiang's visit to India and Nehru's visit to China were of great significance. There are many articles on Indian issues in domestic newspapers and magazines, but most of them focus on the exploration of current issues, and few systematically introduce Indian history. Because compiling a history is extremely difficult, especially after the cultural catastrophe of World War II, and the Indian nation itself has never paid much attention to its own history, making the collection of Indian historical materials even more difficult. The lack of a relatively complete history of India in our country is not because historians do not pay attention to Indian history, but because there is no complete Indian historical material available for them to compile. Recently, Zhengzhong Bookstore published "An Outline of Indian History" edited by Li Zhichun, which I feel is worth introducing.

Li's "An Outline of Indian History" is compiled based on Oxford's Indian history textbook and his research experience in India. The content of this book is rich and the writing is popular and fluent, which goes without saying. The author is also able to gradually analyze various factors in Indian history using deductive methods, and then discuss them using inductive methods, so that readers can have a new understanding and speculation about India's past, present, and future after reading this book.

The Indian nation is very complex, but it can be mainly divided into two major systems: Aryan and Tamil, from the north and south. The Indian nation has more than four or five thousand years of recorded history, but in these four or five thousand years, their various ethnic groups have never united, and that was true in the past, and it is still true now. Because of the divisions between ethnic groups, India has a tragic fate. In their entire history, except for the Aryans who once established "India for the Indians," they have almost always been ruled by foreigners. The author clearly describes in this book that this is caused by the "Indian disease" of the Indian nation's lack of unity.

Indian culture was once brilliant, but these superior cultures have not yet been valued and understood by Europeans. In the eyes of Europeans, India is just an uncivilized barbarian nation. Only we Chinese can defend her against this erroneous and insulting view, just as the author says: Only we Chinese understand and appreciate the true Indian culture. A barefoot Chinese monk understands Indian culture more thoroughly than English gentlemen. This view is very correct.

India has been devastated by many wars, but its four to five thousand years of culture has been preserved, thanks to the power of religion. India was defeated on the battlefield, but not in culture. Although the various states and tribes in India are scattered and disunited, they have a unified culture, which invisibly enables the various states and tribes to gradually move towards unity. Now that India is independent, the struggles between tribes are still fiercely ongoing, but many Indians are working hard to cure this "Indian disease." I believe that soon, India will become a complete country, as the author says.

The author divides the entire book into five parts and thirty-three chapters, with approximately 120,000 words. He divides Indian history into five periods:

1.  Prehistoric Period: Refers to the period before Indian culture has verifiable history, or the cultural period of the indigenous peoples of India.

2.  Ancient History Period: That is, the Vedic period and the Hindu dynasty period.

3.  Middle History Period: The period of rule by the Afghans and Muslims.

4.  Modern History Period: The Mughal Empire period when the descendants of Timur invaded India.

5.  Contemporary History Period: From the arrival of Europeans in the East and the decline of India to the period of national awakening and national revival.

In these five periods, the author describes the ancient history in particular detail, because the ancient history period was the time when Indian culture and all social systems were established. In the ancient history period, we can explore the origins of Indian culture. In modern history, the author omitted the chapter on India under British rule and the independence movement. Now that the flag of Indian independence is flying high, the independence movement can be considered to have come to an end. In order to complete the book, it is hoped that the author can add it in the reprint.

### Collection of Essays on Mental Hygiene

— Huang Shishu

Written by Zan, published by Commercial Press

The author uses fluent writing to discuss the functions and importance of mental hygiene from various aspects, advocating mental hygiene. His attitude is scientific. Every question must start with case studies, and conclusions must be meticulous. His discussion of the difference in blood pressure between Europeans and Americans and Chinese people is an example. Naturally, we do not think that his views are completely agreeable. For example, he explains that a young person's fainting who is dissatisfied with their family is a protest against their father. Of course, we cannot say that it is impossible, and we even admit that fainting allows this young person to cope with the situation at the time, but it does not necessarily have to be said that this is a protest against their father. We believe that if a "sufficient" explanation can be found, there is no need to find a "tortuous" one, and if a more common explanation can be used, there is no need to look for a more circuitous explanation.

The author opposes attributing everything to heredity, "because this is a lazy and irresponsible approach." Incidentally, attributing everything to heredity is somewhat like some philosophers attributing everything to God. In the end, it not only becomes a "garbage can," but also becomes quite vague, empty, and becomes a mysterious thing.

He is not biased. He wants to "liberate himself from traditional sectarian prejudices and misunderstandings" (page 5). In the article "The Development of Modern Medical Psychology," he gives Freud a fairly fair evaluation. He acknowledges the limitations of Freud's theories and methods, believing that Freud overemphasized biological instincts and ignored the normative role of the cultural environment on human behavior, and that his concept of development remained somewhat stuck in a mechanical interpretation. But he points out that Freud's theories are not, as some people say, entirely metaphysical speculation, but the crystallization of empirical clinical experience. Freud discovered the dynamic function of the subconscious in human behavior—especially pathological behavior—and abandoned the one-sided tendency in psychiatric research towards physical research and turned to psychological understanding, discovered the importance of childhood, and provided developmental research methods.

The author also said elsewhere that "human beings are not only physiological, but also psychological. It is not scientific enough to study human physiological phenomena in isolation from the influence of psychological factors. Therefore, human health is unified in body and mind, and cannot be separated." He also stated that he was "dissatisfied with using a simple stimulus-response (S.R.) formula to explain human behavior" because "it ignores the active and positive functions of the reactor's cognitive process and the social and cultural significance attached to the stimulus itself, and these functions and meanings not only determine the content of people's reactions, but also are the main driving force for human beings to recognize the environment and transform the environment."

He emphasizes the environment, believing that heredity "only provides a possible trend of development, and we can still use human power to transform this trend!" He pays attention to cultural factors. This is evident everywhere in this collection. He believes that the formation of a personality has three factors: one is the individual's biological mechanism, the second is the requirements of culture, and the third is the individual's selective process of absorbing culture.

Because the author values cultural factors, he not only points out that many diseases are often caused by psychological factors, but also believes that mental illness is related to cultural factors, and that mental hygiene must first transform culture. We strongly agree with this view. Mental hygiene workers, if they do not recognize this premise, will not be able to grasp the causes and treatments of many mental illnesses. The author certainly stated that he valued childhood life experiences, but he believed that to understand the meaning of symptoms, "we should understand the patient's entire personality structure and the process at the time of illness."

He says, "We only make faithful descriptions of the special facts we have discovered and explore its causes and effects. We do not use partial facts as a universally applicable extrapolation." For example, the same symptoms may have different causes. If we apply the conclusions obtained from a case study to all cases with similar symptoms without limitation, we will make mistakes. The facts and conclusions of mental hygiene cases cannot be generalized and applied without limitation because each individual's life experience is different. However, there are more or less similar aspects, so mental hygiene cases still have reference value.

From the above standpoint, he studied issues such as "the Way of Father and Son" and "Between Men and Women." He says, "There are no children with behavioral problems if there are no parents with psychological problems." There are several articles in this book about "Between Men and Women." He points out that this issue "is not only very important in the premarital life of young people, but also in the post-marital family life, the psychological adaptation of men and women is still not to be ignored." He analyzes "the confusion of young people," women's hostility towards men, and so on. In short, sexual issues are extremely important. "Sex has long become a taboo in our society, and theocratic thought and feudal morality have added another layer of mystery to it. As a result, people cannot easily gain scientific knowledge of it like other bodily functions. But it is indeed a part of people's bodily functions, and it is a relatively important part that affects people's physical and mental development. The fact is also forcing people to deal with the many problems caused by this function. As a result, vague understanding, curious secret exploration, the sin of social taboos, and religious feelings of uncleanliness all continue to create emotional anxiety in people. This is the crux of the impact of sexual issues on mental health. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the mystery of sexual issues now, and let scientific knowledge help us rationally deal with the problems caused by sexual function. This should be given special attention in our country's educational facilities."

The reason why we want to study these issues is to make everyone psychologically sound. The "main goal" of treating mental patients is "to enable patients to obtain reasonable and sound methods to restore their psychological balance." "The object of mental hygiene research is the pathological psychological phenomena that people have accumulated and developed in real life, so it particularly emphasizes the study of the entire human psychological process and the social and cultural environment in which people live."

In short, "Collection of Essays on Mental Hygiene" is a book with insightful and useful ideas. People who are interested in psychology can take a look, and young people and parents may also want to read it. Mental hygiene is extremely important. Many social problems are often problems of individual psychological pathology. It is hoped that other books of similar nature will continue to emerge.

### Editor's Note

— Tongxian

The assassination of Mr. Gandhi shocked the world. The Indian nation has a bit of mystery. In order for us to have a deeper understanding of India, this issue specially introduces a book about Indian history, hoping to attract readers' attention. Recently, there have been two other noteworthy events: one is that students of Tongji University went on strike and petitioned, leading to Mayor Wu being beaten; the other is that Shanghai dancers held a meeting and petitioned, leading to the Social Affairs Bureau being smashed. The former is related to the cultivation of young people, and the latter is related to the psychology of the masses. Therefore, we also introduce the book "Mental Hygiene" as a reference for everyone's self-cultivation and research.

From many of the recent submissions we have received, we have discovered a gratifying fact: there are many articles introducing scientific, mathematical, and historical books. Readers can also see this fact from the recent issues of the publishing industry. We still hope that domestic scholars and scientists will introduce the latest famous foreign scientific works to us. Conversely, we also feel that there are too few good manuscripts introducing literary works. We hope that literary writers will introduce excellent literary books to us.

Chinese writers have a habit of often being proud of being asked for manuscripts. I do not agree with this point. Especially for publications like ours that introduce books, reputable writers should regard guiding younger generations or exchanging knowledge as their duty. We do not ask reputable writers for manuscripts, but we very much hope that they will automatically introduce the good books they have read to us, so that they can be shared with others or help young people in their studies.

### Review and Introduction to "Outline of the Chinese Constitution"

— Ye Qiuyuan

(Edited by Yu Kun, published by Zhonghua Book Company, the whole book has 310,000 words, priced at nine yuan.)

In the January 1948 issue of the "Foreign Affairs Quarterly," there was an article by George W. Mallory, an American scholar of Chinese history, entitled "China's New Constitution," which praised our country's newly implemented constitution. He began by saying: "The new constitution passed by the National Assembly of the Republic of China on December 25, 1946, was implemented on December 25, 1947. This new constitution is the most democratic constitution, which is more democratic than most people expected, because the constitutional history of the country has suffered many setbacks." But he also said in the conclusion: "From the situation in 1947, it can be seen that in recent years, there has been great progress in political theory; if the government does not make major and thorough reforms in administration, then this new constitution is nothing more than a beautiful piece of writing."

We have studied the constitutions of various countries and know that each has its own advantages, and at the same time, we also know that each has its own shortcomings. There is no absolute superiority or inferiority in political systems, only relatively good or bad, but the most important thing is that it is practical and easy to implement. Speaking of our country's new constitution, not to mention that domestic political scientists unanimously praise it; even political scholars from all over the world, as long as they have insight into our country's political situation, all recognize that it is a democratic and progressive constitution. If these 175 articles can be implemented, then our country's constitutional government will have a bright future. Therefore, the current problem is no longer the quality of the constitution, but whether the constitution can be effectively implemented.

The so-called constitution is the fundamental law of the country that the whole country must abide by, and not only must the government implement it effectively, but also the people of the whole country must be able to understand the content of the constitution and everyone must be able to understand the spirit of the law. Only in this way can a true constitution be realized. However, our country has 450 million people, and illiteracy accounts for a very large percentage. Even those who know literature do not know what the constitution is at all. How can we hope that all the people of the country can abide by the constitution? Some people say that we can say that we are in the stage of learning about democratic constitutionalism, and we can only seek progress in learning. We completely agree with this statement, but the most important step in learning democracy and learning constitutionalism is to understand the content and spirit of our country's new constitution.

The Chinese publishing industry has a dazzling array of works on the constitution, but there are not many that are suitable for university teaching and general reference; recently, Zhonghua Book Company published Mr. Yu Kun's "Outline of the Chinese Constitution," which seems to have value in introducing it to the readers of this newspaper. The book has a total of 310,000 words and is divided into eleven chapters: Introduction; Tracing the History of Constitution-Making in China; The Process of Drafting the Constitution of the Republic of China; The Constitutional Movement during the War of Resistance Against Japan; Before and After the Political Consultative Conference; The Convening of the National Assembly and the Completion of the Constitution-Making Work; The Spirit of the Chinese Constitution; The Central Political System; Local System; People's Rights and Obligations; The Implementation and Amendment of the Constitution; Appendix: The Constitution of the Republic of China.

This work has many characteristics, but due to space limitations, it cannot be described in detail, but the most important ones are two. First, regarding the process of constitution-making in our country, the author stands on an objective position and makes an unbiased description; from the Political Consultative Conference to the National Assembly's enactment of the constitution, there are detailed records, which can often be read as a modern Chinese political history. Second, the author has a solid theoretical research on the constitution, and is especially familiar with the political systems of various countries, so he uses the theory and practice of constitutional government in various countries to explain the characteristics of our country's constitution, which makes it particularly clear. In short, this book is worth recommending to readers.

### Chemical Essence

— Li Tishi

(Written by Wu Ruinian, published by Zhonghua Book Company)

There are many physics and chemistry textbooks, but there are very few books for comprehensive review. Even if there are one or two, most of them only collect exercises, provide answers, and call them review books. Chemistry is the most complex and miscellaneous of all sciences. General textbooks, of course, do not lack systematic and clear descriptions, but because the scope of chemistry is too broad, students find it difficult. This "Chemical Essence" is indeed the most valuable auxiliary book to date, suitable for review and reference, and can also be used as a concise chemistry dictionary. Students can get a clear outline after reading this book in addition to studying chemistry, which is helpful for learning chemistry.

The compilation of this book is original to the author, Mr. Wu Ruinian. It discards the usual formal order and uses inductive and comprehensive methods, dividing it into six parts. The first part is the explanation of definitions, laws, and aliases. All chemical definitions and laws are arranged in Roman alphabetical order and explained. The explanation of aliases is rarely seen in other books, which is a feature of this book. The so-called alias is the common names of those chemical manufacturing products that we usually call, such as alcohol, asphalt, calcium carbide, etc., explained with English names and detailed explanations, and listed with chemical molecular formulas. This part has left the classroom scope and entered daily life, which is more interesting.

The second part is non-metals and their compounds, which are classified by elements of the same valence, and each individual element or compound is described in a single section. The characteristic of this part is the emphasis on the combination of "valence," that is, all elements of the same valence are combined together. The third part is metal elements, which are divided according to the tribal properties of the metals, and the elements of the same tribe are grouped together and then divided into sections. The fourth part is organic compounds, which are also classified and described in the same way.

The fifth part, Chemical Dissociation, is a question-and-answer section created by the author himself, divided into seven categories according to their formal differences, such as distinction questions, descriptive questions, etc., each with answers. Strictly speaking, the answers to these exercises are useful for reference, but judging from the style of the whole book, this part is not necessary. Having it does not add to the book, and removing it is not a loss to the scholars.

The sixth part, Chemical Calculations, is also divided into six different types of chemical calculations, each with examples to illustrate. The exercises included in this aspect are too simple and do not match the content in front, and scholars are not satisfied, but the classification is detailed, the writing is concise, and the answers are particularly clear, which is more than enough for middle school students to refer to.

The first part of this book, the explanation of definitions, laws, and aliases, is rarely seen in current chemical books and can be used as a chemistry dictionary for reference, which is very useful. In addition, the second and third parts describe each element very simply. The author uses a quick knife to cut through the mess, dividing each into "discovery," "existence," "preparation," "properties," and "uses," and explaining each item, directly and straightforwardly, which is very commendable. For general students to cope with exams, the fifth and sixth parts are quite convenient, but in terms of value, the first four parts are the most important, especially the explanation of aliases in the first part, combined with the elements in the middle two parts, can simply be used as a self-study or common sense reader, which is the greatest value of this book.

There are also unsatisfactory aspects of this book, that is, the lack of chemical theory, which the author says he has included in the first part, in the explanation of names. However, including it in the explanation of definitions, laws, and aliases is not satisfactory, especially more advanced theories, there is no reason why this book should not have included them in another part.

The compilation of this book should be an attempt, a progressive, new reform and creation in the publication of chemistry books, which is worth studying and promoting. According to this style, it is hoped that a more detailed, more advanced, and more complete "Chemical Essence" will be published for students above middle school to use.

### Reading "Phoenix Garden"

— Ye Ping

By Shi Jimei, published by Dazhong Publishing House

In her "Postscript," the author humbly says, "...The impatiens flowers bloomed, but without fragrance, and the flowers were not pretty, nor were the colors beautiful; but because they were planted by my own hand, I became a little biased... In my mother's camphor wood chest, there are still treasured tiger-head shoes that we wore in our childhood, and a small cotton-padded jacket with blue plums and kingfisher green embroidery, already worn and old, and a small Turkish hat bought by my father, also worn out, and a boy scout uniform washed until it's faded... These things are long useless and should be thrown away, but why are they still kept? It's not just being stingy; it at least reveals some foolishness, but why keep them? Perhaps it's for this little bit of foolishness that, sometimes, I imagine this heavy camphor wood chest as a crystal memory box, storing countless yesterdays and last night's moons, suns, stars, and years. Then, in an instant, these useless things that should be discarded suddenly feel precious, just like storing these old clothes, just like keeping those humble impatiens flowers. I sorted out the manuscript of 'Phoenix Garden' with extreme anxiety and shyness." "Phoenix Garden" is Shi Jimei's first collection, including ten short stories and two novellas.

Just like her poetic and beautiful "Postscript," each of her novels is the same. Her joy and preferences are poetic, and her sorrow is also beautiful. Therefore, her novels are close to prose, or even poetry. The first impression after reading "Phoenix Garden" is that the author should not be a novelist. If she engaged in the creation of poetry and prose, she would achieve greater success.

From a writing technique perspective: "Phoenix Garden" is the most successful, with a precise structure, delicate descriptions, gorgeous literary talent, and mysterious colors, all of which capture the reader's emotions. "Three Years" and "The Victory of Love" are two moving stories, but the arrangements are a bit cliché. Here, the author expresses more of her self-ideal: noble sympathy and great self-sacrifice. "Purple Poppy" is also similar, but the character portrayal outweighs the story narration, so although there are no bizarre or convoluted plots, it is more gentle and moving. "Qin Linliu" and "Xiao Bu Dian'er" also focus on personality description. The most lovely is "Xiao Er's Melancholy." "Dream Seeker" is a prose poem from beginning to end. "Blue Angel" describes the psychology of a vain girl. "The Fool's Joy" narrates the poor life of a poor teacher. "Spring of the Earth" is set in the countryside and could be a good creation, but reading it, one feels that the writing lacks a kind of earthy气息, probably due to the author's detachment from the living environment.

Each piece in "Phoenix Garden" is young, is the brilliance of youth, but not the light and heat of youth. The author's touch is like a gentle guitar, not a bright horn; like a slow stream, not a roaring ocean; and like a bright window and clean table, a spotless room, filled with fresh flowers, antiques, and elegant landscapes and ancient books, but without brooms or rags—those dirty, annoying things, but sometimes they are necessary. "...They all dream more than they realize; they can create beautiful mirages, but rarely have great achievements; they have the art of living, but lack the common sense of living; they all can 'understand elegant meaning from string music,' but cannot 'rise at the crowing of the rooster'..." Perhaps Mrs. Feng's words in "Phoenix Garden" are the best description.

Although we don't therefore think that the author is useless or that the work is empty, on the contrary, we only feel that the author is frank and detached. Her work is pure, skilled, and sincere, because she dedicates the purest part of her soul to the reader, without pretense or restraint. Although it lacks a kind of soaring power, it does not whine without illness. Although dissatisfied with reality, it is not pessimistic. She dreams of mirages without ever losing heart, seeming to strive to create a Platonic Utopia or Tao Yuanming's Peach Blossom Spring. She has many friends, like-minded people, and she believes that this dream will one day succeed. The author seems to have this kind of optimism. As for those who are not friends and things outside the Peach Blossom Spring, she is not ignorant, but she views them with indifference and treats them with silence.

Therefore, young people love her works, especially the unblemished young people, naturally love her advantages, gorgeous writing, poetic atmosphere, pure ideals... But what is even more loved by young people is her weaknesses: her thirst and unease, her warmth towards humanity, her love for dreams, her simple heart and profound philosophy, her frank and mysterious, skilled and lonely, strong and timid soul, as well as her contradictory views on people and things. Her weaknesses are more able to grasp the emotions of young people than her strengths, because she is as unblemished as they are. What they want to say, what they want to say, is these things, and she has already written them for them.

### Dancing and Marriage

— Wang Kao

Recently, the central government's explicit order to disband dance halls has caused quite a bit of criticism from the industry. We won't discuss the rights and wrongs of each other, but now we'll provide a material that can be considered interesting:

In Dr. Hu Shi's study abroad diary, volume 3, there is an entry on January 4th, year 3 of the Republic of China: "The position of women in our country is higher than that of women in the West." (Original book, volume 1, page 154) "Suddenly, I think that the position of women in our country is actually higher than that of women in the West. Our country takes care of women's chastity and reputation, and does not allow them to be burdened by marriage themselves. All marriages are decided by parents. Men are born to build homes, and women are born to manage homes. Women do not need to dedicate themselves to social interactions for the sake of marriage, seeking their own spouses in a busy manner, so they value women's personality. The West is not like this. When women grow up, seeking a spouse is their business. Parents then teach them music and dance, and then let them go out to interact with men. Those who can please men, or who can use tricks to drive men into their clutches, are the first to find a spouse; those who are too strong and simple, or who are unwilling to humiliate themselves to please others, remain unmarried as old maids for life. Therefore, sacrificing women's personality and driving them to dedicate themselves to fishing for men's hearts is the sin of freedom of marriage in the West." Then, it goes on to say: "This argument may be too radical, but I am confident that it is not without basis. Those who examine it in its subtleties should not dismiss it as stubborn and old-fashioned."

The above, although it represents Mr. Hu's early great theory of seeing the "subtleties," in fact, I cannot agree with it. At least, Mr. Hu is academic and logical. This kind of argument that represents the whole with a part—or even a point—cannot be said to be not falling into error. The second volume of the original book, when discussing "Xie Fan's Theory of the Extinction of the Soul," committed the same error and was pointed out by Mr. Hu. This shows that Mr. Hu was not ignorant, but deliberately pretended to be coy. If Chinese women don't go dancing and don't go socializing, and that's considered high character, then "inner words do not leave the boudoir, and outer affairs do not enter the door," and "men and women do not touch hands when giving and receiving" should also be respected as valuing women. If we extend this further, men can take concubines, and women are solely machines for passing on the family line; can't we also say the same thing? We shouldn't be surprised either. A little later, Mr. Lin Yutang, in "Glimpses of Peking," talked about the aesthetic principles of bound feet and the family harmony of concubinage. However, Mr. Lin's purpose was to show off his strangeness, and his ultimate goal was to make his works one of the bestsellers. This is his Practicalism, which is somewhat forgivable. Mr. Hu's argument is probably not like this. Because his marriage was old-fashioned, arranged by his mother, and Hu was filial to his mother and couldn't bear to divorce, he made this self-deception of Ah Q. The second volume of the same book has a paragraph discussing marriage issues, which mentioned the reasons for not divorcing, which can be used as proof.

Seeking a mate is a biological requirement, not limited to humans. Peacocks open their screens when they see females, and pheasants wag their tails and make sounds. There is no question of "chastity and reputation" here. Mr. Hu, who studied agriculture at Cornell, should have understood this principle. If it is as he said, the ancient saying "women adorn themselves for those who please them" would be a great sin. Ancient China also had the custom of dancing to seek a mate, which is the Cou You in the Zheng Feng of the Book of Songs, "Scholars hold orchids," "Only scholars and women, intimately teasing each other, presenting each other with peonies." The custom of the Yi people dancing under the moon today is probably not much different. As for keeping women at home and only allowing people to "xiangqin," marrying whoever they want, and marrying as many as they want, this is entirely a disease after the establishment of a male-centered society.

Returning to the topic, the relationship between dancing and marriage was not initially related to morality as Mr. Hu said. However, morality is not immutable. Biological things can be transformed into moral things by society. For the enjoyment of adults and gentlemen, it is also necessary to attack some pitiful things. In fact, dancing is probably not only a pastime for those who claim to be "怜香惜玉," but also a stubborn habit that those who "te fu wan jie" enjoy and forget. As for pleasing men in order to attach oneself to marriage, in China, it is not such a noble thing! It's pitiful to say.

### Memory

— Chen Xueling

"Why is there a knot in your handkerchief?"

"My wife wanted me to remember to mail a letter for her."

"Then did you mail it?"

"No, she forgot to give me the letter."

### Contentment Brings Happiness

— Nian Hong

"Contentment brings happiness" is a well-known and irrefutable truth in our country throughout history. And it may be precisely our national essence and recognized wonderful philosophy of life. I remember a folk song in my hometown: "Riding a horse, full of spirit; driving a donkey, lazy and sluggish; but wait until you look back and see the pedestrians." It means to think about everything in a step-by-step manner.

This is really a clever saying. The donkey driver, seeing the pedestrian, of course feels arrogant and invincible, and the pedestrian, although walking with sweat, if compared with the horse carrying people, feels comforted and no longer envies the horse rider and the donkey driver. Even the horse ridden under people's crotches, thinking that its owner is more prominent and powerful than the donkey's owner, can't help but forget its hard work and feel somewhat elated, "Insufficient compared to the top, more than enough compared to the bottom." According to this logic, the donkey driver is content with driving the donkey, the pedestrian is content with walking, and the horse as livestock is content with being ridden. Thus, the horse rider can let go of the reins and add a whip without worrying about anything else.

The best example of contentment bringing happiness is Yan Hui, the proud disciple of Confucius, "A bamboo basket of rice, a gourd of water, living in a humble alley, others cannot bear the hardship, but Hui does not reduce his joy." Yan Hui's endurance is truly outstanding. Otherwise, how could he be content and at ease under such poor material conditions of food, clothing, and shelter? Moreover, "Yu thought that if there were drowning people in the world, it was as if he himself was drowning; Ji thought that if there were hungry people in the world, it was as if he himself was hungry." Sages have a heart to worry about the world, and they should naturally worry before the world worries and enjoy after the world enjoys. The Spring and Autumn period was better than the current world of strife, but the frequent wars among the princes were already inferior to the Great Harmony and Lesser Prosperity. Besides Yan Hui, there must have been many people who not only had a bamboo basket of rice and a gourd of water, but also many who could not even afford a bamboo basket of rice and a gourd of water. Yan Hui was able to live in a humble alley, perhaps because he also tasted the samadhi of contentment bringing happiness. Since Confucius, Yan Hui has been listed as a virtuous man, and he is respected as a virtuous man because he was able to abide by a bamboo basket of rice and a gourd of water, and regarded the rich clothes and delicacies of princes and ministers as discarded shoes, while Xiang Yu, who said "can be taken and replaced," was inevitably criticized as a man of mere bravery who was not enough to achieve great things.

Being slapped in the face is like accidentally tripping and falling; drinking some rice porridge for three meals is like a frozen corpse on the roadside; a small room where you can't turn around is like a beggar under a covered street; unfortunately dying is like your parents not giving birth to you. If you have this great spirit of contentment and are optimistic about everything, you will be able to ascend to eternal bliss, and your children and grandchildren will praise you as "virtuous, virtuous."

### After Demobilization

— Mei Bai

Last December, the remains of General Dai Anlan, a hero who died in the Battle of Burma, were accompanied back to his hometown for burial by Mrs. Dai, who traveled a long distance. Unexpectedly, General Dai's funeral was bleak, and Mrs. Dai even suffered from a lack of funds and drifted in a foreign land. The spirit could not be buried in peace early, and the living even suffered from lack of food! At that time, after a hundred feelings, I published a short article in Free Talk called "How to Comfort the Martyrs." Since then, although I heard that there were enthusiastic patriots who generously helped, so that General Dai could rest in peace early, I have since vowed to collect some information to see how other countries settle the soldiers who return home after demobilization and how they comfort the families of the fallen soldiers.

Recently, I saw several articles from extremely reliable sources, and I couldn't help but feel a mixture of emotion and shame! Chinese soldiers can certainly fight bravely against the enemy and put their lives at stake! But looking at how other people take care of their soldiers, I really feel that we have failed our anti-Japanese warriors too much. Speaking of taking care of soldiers in every possible way, we often first think of the United States. As long as American soldiers serve for sixty days, they can get $200 in severance pay upon discharge. If they have worked overseas, they can get $300. According to our official exchange rate, it would be 20 to 30 million to use, and the general prices in the United States are of course lower than in our country. But, in fact, the treatment of discharged soldiers in the United States is still far worse than that of other countries!

The best treatment for soldiers is probably in the Soviet Union. Soldiers receive a full year's "enxiang" for every year of service in the military. In other words, a soldier who has served for five years is given a severance fee by the government equivalent to five years of total military pay upon demobilization. But the Red Army's salary is actually very low, and the total amount of one year's enxiang is not much. However, the Soviet policy has a major feature: it can guarantee to find a job with excellent treatment for every discharged soldier within a month, and the salary of this new job is absolutely higher than the salary that the soldier earned before joining the army. The Soviet system is also particularly considerate in solving the housing problem for discharged soldiers. From the beginning of the war, the government has set aside 10% of the new houses and new apartments built across the country for the families of discharged soldiers or fallen soldiers to live in. If the soldiers originally had good families, but they were destroyed by artillery fire in the war, then the government will provide all the wood needed for free and give a loan equivalent to about $2,000, specifically for construction.

The UK is slightly worse than the Soviet Union. Soldiers each receive $49 in "fitting-out expenses" upon discharge, specifically for tailoring regular clothes. Any soldier who has served for three years (of which at least two years must be overseas), if he is married and has children, can additionally use a subsidy of $475; if he is a lieutenant, he can use a sum of $1,300.

According to US government regulations, discharged soldiers can apply to the government for long-term low-interest loans of $2,000 to $4,000 for housing education, and other expenses. But compared to New Zealand, it is inferior. Discharged soldiers in New Zealand can each receive a cash subsidy of $975, and they can also apply for a low-interest loan of up to $4,850. If the New Zealand warrior is willing to "return to the countryside" after "demobilization," then the government will give priority to land or lend him a sum of money to buy land. He can apply to the government for a loan of up to $20,200, interest-free, to be repaid within 45 years.

Moreover, the New Zealand government is also very considerate of the family life of discharged soldiers. If soldiers want to add a set of sofas or an electric refrigerator, and the value is less than $50, they only need to send the purchase invoice to the government, and the government will pay the bill immediately.

Yugoslavia and Romania also made great efforts to enable "demobilized" people to "return to the countryside." After they confiscated all the land of the Axis people and pro-Axis nationals, they divided it equally among the brave men who returned from demobilization. Often, one person can be allocated more than twenty acres. As long as they are willing to work hard, they can be worry-free for life.

### Making Friends

— Yun Gong

Speaking of making friends, we naturally think of Mr. Dale Carnegie, the author of "How to Win Friends and Influence People." In fact, before publishing this book, Mr. Carnegie had already written a lot of books. His books on oratory, etc., were adopted as textbooks by youth association schools in New York, Brooklyn, Curayden, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and other places more than thirty years ago. His writing is fluent and lively, and the serious subject matter is interspersed with lightheartedness, making it interesting to read. He himself has also served as a teacher in the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, the Philadelphia Real Estate Bureau, and the New York Credit Men's Association, but he has always been unknown until he wrote "How to Win Friends—." Only then did he become famous, which shows the general importance that people attach to making friends.

Regarding making friends, I also remember a short article I saw in an English magazine, saying that a certain gentleman went out in the morning, and without him opening his mouth, the newspaper boy automatically handed him the newspaper; when he got on the streetcar, the driver cleared a seat for him; when he went to the tobacco shop to buy cigarettes, he didn't have to pay in cash, because these people were all his old friends. This meaning is similar to our country's common saying "Rely on your parents at home, rely on your friends when you go out," and it is even deeper. Unexpectedly, making friends can enjoy so many conveniences, and have the joy of being successful in everything, which is admirable.

I once told my friend Mr. Kang about this idea, but Mr. Kang didn't think so. He said that to make people work for you, you have to make friends with money. So, the beautiful dream I had after reading that article was punctured by his sharp insight.

Chapter Nine: Leaking Secrets (63)

Xiao Bai said, "You think it's unreasonable, but she's doing it with all her might, and both sides are preparing very well." Yu Ru said, "Can this kind of major marriage event be established without the parents' approval?" Bai said, "Young people don't do things like we do now. As long as they can achieve their goals, they will use any means." Yu Ru said, "As a parent, I can stop him." Xiao Bai shook his head and said, "This is not effective. With your power, you can call Zhu Zhai back and scold him severely, but it is impossible to stop him from getting married. He doesn't have to bother, he only needs to walk away behind your back and get married in another city. By the time the rice is cooked, what can you do? You only have one son. Can you bear to break off relations with him? At that time, you will have to reluctantly admit it." Yu Ru was speechless after hearing what Xiao Bai said. He stared with wide eyes and stamped his feet several times, muttering, "It's killing me! It's killing me!" Xiao Bai said, "Don't be angry. I have a way. You might as well try it. Maybe it will work. Gu Qiwan was originally from an official family, and her family background is very good. She usually cares most about her face. Now you only need to go to her house and talk to her, tell her about the situation in your family, and declare to her that you didn't know about Zhu Zhai's marriage to Feng Sheng. Feng Sheng is still nominally a singer. When she comes to your house in the future, she will have no status. And your family has no property, and there will be problems with her livelihood in the future. If she becomes your daughter-in-law, it will not be convenient for her to perform on stage. All these problems should be considered. Besides, Zhu Zhai is your only son, and your wife pays the most attention to etiquette, don't call Zhu Zhai to make things difficult for her. As for her affection for Zhu Zhai, you can forgive her very much. This matter was extremely supported before Fang in Zhu got married. Now that she is married, it is very difficult for the parents to deal with it. When you talk to her, as long as you are tactful and have a pleading tone, she will definitely be moved and softened. If you rely on a big principle to question her harshly, this matter will only become more and more tense, and it will be impossible to clean up in the future." Yu Ru listened, hesitated for a long time, and said, "I am so old, and it seems unworthy to beg a girl like this." Xiao Bai said, "If you want your family to be happy, this is the best way, because once a man and a woman have feelings, it is not easy to shake them no matter how much they are磨折. You must be able to grasp her weakness and take advantage of the situation to shake her will. Qiwan is very stubborn, but she is full of emotion, and this method can be used to move her." Yu Ru listened and was still hesitant. Mrs. Xu persuaded from the side, "What the second brother said is right, why don't you go and take a trip? It would be better if it succeeds, and if there is no result, think of other ways!" After Yu Ru was persuaded by his wife and Xie Bai again and again, and after a night of deliberation, he decided to go to Qiwan's house to investigate the next day! (End of this section)

### On Medical Ethics

— Buyi

My child has been suffering from whooping cough for almost a month. Initially, I tried various cough medicines advertised widely in the market, but none of them worked. So, through a friend's introduction, I consulted two quite famous pediatricians, one after the other. After asking about the condition, the first doctor frowned and said, "Be careful about cold and hot food and drink. If you notice a fever in the child, come back for treatment." He didn't even write a prescription and dismissed me. As I walked out the door, I felt a bit angry. It's too easy for a doctor to earn a consultation fee like that. The second doctor was very attentive. He said that injections were necessary. When I asked how many injections were needed, he replied that at least fifteen injections were required, taking about a month and a half. I thought that my child had already been coughing for a month, and adding another month and a half of injections, whether it would actually get better was still a question. In the end, it would still last a hundred days, so why bother with so many needle pricks and medical expenses?

Today, I happened to meet an old classmate. I asked him if there was any special remedy for coughs. He smiled and replied, "Today, as an old classmate, I'll tell you something that ordinary doctors wouldn't tell you. Not only is there none in China, but there isn't any in any country in the world. Recently, Americans have said that all cough medicines available now are ineffective." Only then did I realize. Looking back, the first doctor I consulted was honest and likable, while the second doctor was clearly trying to drum up business and cheat me out of medical fees.

I remember a few years ago, a friend of mine had a severe stomach ache in the summer. He went to a certain large hospital, and they diagnosed it as appendicitis and said it needed to be operated on. Because my friend thought the consultation fee at that hospital was too expensive, he went to another hospital for a second examination. It was still diagnosed as appendicitis, and the doctor gave him an hour to have the surgery. He hurriedly used that hour to arrange for the medical fees. Suddenly, he had an urgent need to defecate. After a bout of diarrhea, his abdominal pain immediately subsided. My friend has been healthy and well ever since, without ever having his appendix removed. Could it be that these two famous hospitals couldn't even diagnose appendicitis properly? I think it was more likely that they were greedy for a quick and easy business opportunity. After all, removing the appendix is relatively safe, and besides, the appendix is ultimately a superfluous appendage. However, in terms of medical ethics, taking advantage of someone in a time of crisis is a grave violation of the doctor's fundamental principles.

I have heard of and encountered many doctors who truly possess a spirit of kindness and sacrifice, which is admirable and deeply appreciated. However, there are also many who, knowing they cannot cure, recklessly prescribe medicine or take advantage of people's distress, like "creating sores on healthy flesh." I hope they can put themselves in the patients' shoes and reflect on how painful it would be if they were the patients themselves, or the family members of the patients!

### Ling Xiaohan Pavilion in Memory

— Sun He

Among the reporters who were quite prominent in the early years of the Republic—forgive me for using this Shanghai slang—those who were promoted have risen to become elders or important figures, those who have died are dead, those who have fallen have fallen. Many have become honored elders or even great-grandfathers. Today, those who are still writing articles can probably be counted on one hand. As far as I know, the only one who is still vigorously wielding his pen is Ling Xiaohan Pavilion—Mr. Xu Lingxiao.

The Xu Lingxiao that people know today is mostly the Ling Xiaohan Pavilion who is a master of historical anecdotes. In fact, in terms of historical anecdotes, Mr. Lingxiao's younger brother, Mr. Yishi, is even more specialized. The Xu Lingxiao that I know is a multifaceted talent, namely:

Engineer—He graduated from Beiyang University with a degree in engineering, but he never seemed to pursue his original profession throughout his life, so many people are unaware of his background.

Communication Expert—In the early years of the Republic, Mr. Xu was a master at writing Beijing dispatches. His characteristics were: Interweaving narration and commentary; objective descriptions and subjective criticisms. Comprehensive Reporting: Stringing together many unrelated events like beads on a string, making them an organic piece of news. Witty Style: Using a subtle and insightful tone, creating light and flavorful metaphors. Proficient in Historical Anecdotes: Especially familiar with the background and personality of every important figure in the government, able to grasp their position and background and make inferences. Insider News: Revealing some insider information from the dispatches that people would rather keep secret, inferring three corners from one. Reflecting the Atmosphere: Such as noting where the carriage stopped in which alley, the expressions of the dignitaries sitting in the pond pavilion watching the opera, subtly measuring the political atmosphere from the side, without avoiding trivial details. Literary Temperament: The "reportage literature" that is popular today blends literature and journalism into one. Mr. Xu had already demonstrated this in his dispatches, so he can be said to have been a visionary.

Journalism Scholar—Chinese universities had journalism departments starting with Shao Piaoping's creation of the Civilian University's Journalism Department, and Mr. Xu was the main professor of the Civilian University's Journalism Department. The range of courses he taught was very broad, from literature to advertising, but it is a pity that he did not teach his housekeeping skills in printing (engineering). (Famous journalists of today, such as Zhang Youluan and Huang Tianpeng, were his students at the time.)

Drama Scholar—Mr. Lingxiao is a theater enthusiast. Almost every article he writes uses theater as a metaphor. When he talks about opera—of course, Peking opera—he not only talks about singing and acting, but also analyzes the plot and script, using a lively method to evaluate the opera, slightly incorporating Western drama theory. At a time when the new youth completely negated old opera and overcorrected, Mr. Lingxiao made the unique contribution of preserving the value of Chinese opera from the side.

Supplement Expert—In Beijing in the teens of the Republic of China, Sun Fuyuan's Chenbao and Jingbao supplements were overwhelming, but Mr. Lingxiao was able to compile another supplement for the Jingbao, standing alongside Mr. Fu Guo in the Jingbao with high-level taste, and also having a large number of readers.

The above is just a glimpse, and it is already so profound.

Although Mr. Lingxiao and I had the pleasure of being colleagues, we were not familiar with each other. What I know is that he is from Yixing, Jiangsu, but grew up in the north, and cannot speak a single word of Jiangnan dialect. When I was teaching at a private university, I passed by the classroom where he was teaching. Nearly twenty years later, I still remember the impression I had at the time: he spoke Beijing dialect with a slight Hebei accent, his voice was not loud, clear and pure, and his appearance was lean and cold. He was wearing an old overcoat, took out a crumpled roll of lecture notes from his pocket, and was not the Ling Xiaohan Pavilion who spoke with a crisp and clear Beijing accent as I had imagined.

Mr. Lingxiao is still as sharp as ever, which is gratifying. Although his writing style is gradually becoming more rugged, he is, after all, "an old general or a Sichuan horse, one is worth two." I wish him "good health" here!
