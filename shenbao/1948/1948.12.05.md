### The Battle Situation on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is Daily Expanding; Northern and Southern National Armies are About to Join Forces; A Major Victory Against the Main Force of the Liu Bandit on the South Bank of the Hui River

[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 4th] The battle situation in the area has shown signs of expanding. After the Huang Wei Corps crossed the North Fei River to attack, they are still engaged in fierce battles with the bandits on the south bank of the Hui River, more than 40 li south of Su County. The southward corps has now crossed Jiagou and is approaching Fuliji, and its western flank has also attacked Qiaoxikou. The Li and Liu corps on the Bengbu front have continued to make progress in the area north of Caolaoji today. According to air force reconnaissance reports, the individual distances of the three major armies are all about 80 li. Military sources informed today that if the battle situation in the area develops according to the predetermined steps, the Sun and Huang corps will be able to join forces no later than the day after tomorrow.

[Our Correspondent in the Bengbu Front, 4th] The battle situation in the area today is as follows: The Liu Corps on the right flank of the National Army advanced to Yuanzhaiji on the south bank of the Jie River. A certain unit of the Li Corps on the front annihilated a reconnaissance battalion of the 6th Column of the bandits near Renheji, and the gains were also significant. A regiment of the 18th Division of that column stubbornly resisted at Lao Caolaoji (about 7 li northwest of Caolaoji Station) and is also being closely besieged and annihilated by the National Army.

[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 4th] It is reported that the Huang Wei Corps previously launched a full-scale attack on the main force of the Liu Bandit, which had invaded a position on the south bank of the Hui River with a longitudinal extension of only 4 kilometers. The situation has now turned favorable. The unit is annihilating an average of more than 3,000 bandits per day, and more than 30,000 bandits have been routed in recent days.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Military news: In the area west of Hongze Lake in northern Anhui, in the Fei River and Hui River basin, the National Army's annihilation battle with the Tianjin-Pukou Railway as the main axis has become increasingly advantageous. The Huang Wei Corps of the National Army in the Shuangyuji area northwest of Bengbu, with superior firepower, inflicted heavy losses on the main force of the Liu Bocheng bandit group, resulting in fierce battles for over ten days, killing and wounding over 20,000 bandits. Currently, the Huang Wei Corps, alongside the Liu Ruming and Li Yannian corps advancing north from Yuexiang, are relentlessly pursuing the Chen and Liu bandit groups fleeing north from Yue Guzhen. The Qiu Qingquan, Li Mi, and Sun Yuanliang corps of the National Army, under the command of Du Yuming, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Xuzhou, withdrew from Xuzhou on the morning of the 3rd and crossed the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to Jiagou with overwhelming superiority. In the Wuliuji and Sunzhuang area (both more than 80 li north of Su County), they defeated the Chen Yi's 3rd, 10th, and 16th Columns of the bandits. The remaining bandits, unable to resist, fled towards eastern Henan. The Chen Yi bandit group's Rapid, 13th, 11th, and 3rd Columns are still stubbornly resisting at Fuliji on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. The National Army continues to launch a joint north-south attack.

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 4th] The National Army in northern Huai has made further progress today. The front and both flanks have advanced close to Guzhen by varying distances of five to ten kilometers, and another battalion of the rearguard of the Chen Bandit's 6th Column has been annihilated. Liu Ziqing, Secretary-General of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters here, told reporters: For more than ten days, the National Army units have used the "strategy of eating the small with the big," consuming at least one regiment of the Chen and Liu bandit forces every day. This inevitable trend of accumulating small victories into a major victory will lead the Chen and Liu bandits to collapse silently.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Military news: On the 4th, the weather was clear, and our air force was dispatched all day to assist ground troops in fiercely bombing the remnants of the bandits who fled from Guzhen on the north bank of the Hui River. The bandits suffered heavy casualties, and small groups of three to five hundred men fled in groups to the northwest.

[Our News] San Francisco Broadcasting: The Chinese Ministry of National Defense recently issued a public statement, stating briefly: The communist bandits in the Huai River area are currently being pressured by the National Army from the north and south and have retreated to the eastern plains of Henan Province. According to official sources, the National Army has reinforced the Central China battlefield with 100,000 troops in order to defend Bengbu and protect the capital. The statement also stated: The ten columns of the Communist Army under Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng are moving from the Huai River towards Linhuanji, Yongcheng, Xiaoxian, and other places in the northwest. The war has also moved to that area. The purpose of the Communist Army's movement is obviously to reorganize the remnants and regroup. In the battles near Su County over the past ten days, the Communist Army suffered approximately 20,000 casualties, while the National Army suffered approximately 7,000 casualties. The statement also acknowledged that Xuzhou was voluntarily evacuated on Friday.

### The Communist Army's Current Actions: Containment is More Important than Attack; Tianjin-Pukou Railway Repair Advances with the Army

[Our Correspondent in Bengbu, 4th] According to the latest deployment decided by the military, the battle situation at Zhusu is about to develop. In this battlefield, the main force of the bandits is the seven columns of Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng's forces, and the relatively complete 2nd, 6th, 11th, and 13th columns of Chen Yi's forces. All of the above bandits were not seriously hit in the Xuzhou Campaign. The military believes that one of the reasons why the bandits are still stubbornly resisting here is to contain the National Army so that it cannot start chasing and suppressing immediately after the end of the Xuzhou Campaign, so that Chen Yi's broken troops have the opportunity to rest and reorganize. Therefore, the current action of the bandits is more about containment than attack.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 4th] People in the capital expressed optimism today about the war in East China, saying that if the National Army advancing south from Xuzhou engages in a major battle with the Communist Army and wins, the battle situation can be stabilized for at least two or three months. Chen Yi's troops were frustrated in their attack east of Xuzhou earlier this month. If they fail again this time, they will be unable to recover. At that time, approximately 35,000 new troops from the National Army in Central China have arrived in the Nanjing area to reinforce it, and 40,000 elite troops were already stationed along the Yangtze River, guarding the natural barrier.

[United Press, Nanjing, 4th] Government officials said on the 4th that 150,000 National Army troops in Central China have been transferred to the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to participate in the war north of Bengbu. It is generally believed that the Communist Army is currently redeploying around Xuzhou in an attempt to launch another offensive. Currently, both the National Army and the Communist Army are deploying reinforcement troops to Bengbu and Su County to prepare for a decisive battle. According to semi-official sources, General Song Xilian, a famous anti-Japanese general in the Songhu battle, has arrived in Bengbu to command four armies, with an estimated strength of about 100,000 men, to guard the important town. The three armies advancing south from Xuzhou have as many as 180,000 men and are advancing towards Su County. The Communist Army between Bengbu and Guzhen has been cleared.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 4th] The Communist Army on the Hui River front is retreating north today to cope with the pressure from the southward corps from Xuzhou. The southward corps, totaling about 250,000 men, has advanced about 40 miles, encountering only weak resistance from the Communist Army. They can join forces with the northward army after advancing another 30 miles to the southwest.

[Our Correspondent in Mingguang, 4th] When the Communist Army was being suppressed by the powerful troops of the National Army, they fled to Wujiawei, 60 li southwest of Dingyuan County, for reorganization. Currently, there is no trace of bandits in the Chibei River and Daishanpu area.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The Tianjin-Pukou Railway repair team, with the smooth progress of the northward National Army, went north from Bengbu on the 4th, along with the repairs. The railway bureau's transportation vehicles are now open to Caolaoji on the banks of the Fei River.

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 4th] Our air force distributed 350,000 copies of return certificates and leaflets to the Communist Army, advising the blindly following Communist masses to surrender as soon as possible.

### Huaiyin Has Not Been Evacuated; All Parts of Northern Jiangsu are Peaceful

[Our Correspondent in Jiangdu, 4th] The military here officially denied the rumor that Huaiyin had been voluntarily evacuated. The military headquarters of a certain army is still stationed in Huaiyin, and military communications are still open. However, many civil service organs and military dependents have moved to Yangzhou, and the various rumors circulating are obviously due to this. Refugees traveling south along the Grand Canal have been arriving in an endless stream in recent days, and the stations and ports are extremely crowded. The city defense department has advanced the curfew to 9:00 PM every night, but the people of Yangzhou are extremely calm.

[Our Correspondent in Zhenjiang, 4th] It is confirmed that all parts of northern Jiangsu have been as peaceful as ever recently, and there have been no wars. Both Huai and Yi are becoming more stable, and the various rumors circulating are not to be believed.

### Unnecessary Ports on the Yangtze River are Strictly Prohibited from Passage

[Our Correspondent in Jiangyin, 4th] The Second Fleet of the Navy has strictly prohibited passage to unnecessary ports, bays, river crossings, and ferry crossings along the north and south banks of the Yangtze River. It has also telegraphed the counties along the river to report the names, navigation and berthing times, and types of all ships that need to navigate and berth in the ports, bays, river crossings, and ferry crossings, and to discuss them with the relevant trade associations, and to reply in detail ten days in advance for public announcement.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Naval Headquarters is aware that the Yangtze River defense deployment has long been completed, and a large number of powerful naval vessels have been mobilized to strengthen the patrolling of the Yangtze River to prevent the remnants of the bandits from harassing. Last week, a New 1st Brigade, 13th Regiment of the Communist Army, with more than 400 men in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, briefly harassed Banyueshan near Shashi and continued to attack Jiangkou (upstream of Shashi). They were intercepted bravely by our garrison naval vessels, and the bandits suffered more than 100 casualties and fled in panic. In the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, small groups of bandits took advantage of the gap to harass Tianxing. The naval vessels and self-defense forces launched a fierce attack, capturing many. The Communist Youyou Regiment of about 500 men near Shagou, Gaoyou, in northern Jiangsu launched a siege on our Shibu self-defense force at dawn on the 29th. They once advanced to the core position of Shibu Town Street and fought fiercely with our self-defense force. The invading bandits were finally annihilated by more than half under the overwhelming firepower of the Navy. The remaining bandits retreated and Shibu was immediately recovered.

### Moscow's Manipulation of Dictatorship Will Inevitably Be Resisted by the Chinese People

New York Daily News Editorial

[New York, United Press, 3rd] The Daily News stated in an editorial today: "Two hundred million Soviets cannot rule 450 million Chinese people. The Chinese people have always extremely despised any form of government, and will likely resist a Moscow-manipulated dictatorship. Moscow's attempt to force individualistic Chinese farmers to implement collective farms will especially be opposed. If the Kremlin wants to control China, it is like biting off a big mouthful of food that cannot be digested. If control can be achieved, it will not happen for many years, and it will require much of the energy that Moscow is now spending in other Cold War areas, especially Western Europe."

### Industrial Self-Salvation

— Xu Kejun

The recent industrial crisis has become increasingly serious. Labor and management are uneasy, disputes arise from time to time, and production is sluggish and difficult to expand. There is a worry of reaching the end of the road! The worker's cost of living index announced on November 15 was 8.1 times, and on the 30th of the same month it was increased to 15.4 times. From the perspective of workers' living needs, this index is not high. However, from the perspective of factories, the sales of finished products are not smooth, and expenditures are increasing day by day, making it truly unbearable. This situation is especially true for non-daily-use machinery manufacturing industries. For example, a historical engineering company in which I participate is facing huge overdrafts and struggling to plan for the future. This can be an example of the current difficulties of the machinery manufacturing industry. Furthermore, from November 15 to 30, prices generally fell. This increase in the index may be to compensate for a previously too low setting. During this half-month, the situation in factories has become even more depressed. Products are unsalable, prices are falling, and expenditures have suddenly doubled, truly reaching a point of desperation. Some say that factories should immediately request industrial loans to maintain themselves, which is also true. Factories requesting industrial loans, and the government, for the sake of maintaining industry, should approve them as appropriate. However, the national treasury is insufficient, and financial resources are very scarce, which will inevitably lead to the issuance of more currency. As a result, factories may not benefit, and the resulting malpractices will only increase the trend of gold purchases, affecting social order, which is also a cause for concern. Others suggest that since factories are difficult to maintain, it would be better to close them down. In fact, closing them down at this time is even more impossible. If factories close down, a huge number of workers will be unemployed. At this time of great turmoil, the unemployment problem is the most serious, and it can be asserted that it will disrupt social stability and create adverse consequences. What is more important is that industry is the lifeblood of the country and society, like the blood vessels of the human body. It must rely on this to circulate nutrients in order to grow and prosper. If industry stagnates, it is tantamount to strangling oneself and cutting off one's food supply. The consequences are unimaginable! Therefore, closing down factories is not the best policy. In this predicament, how can we save ourselves? In my humble opinion, only if factory authorities, technicians, and workers unite as a whole, work together with one heart, can we overcome this difficulty and find a way out together. There are two basic understandings that must be explained first:

(1) The purpose of workers working is to engage in production and obtain appropriate remuneration to maintain their lives. The current method of remuneration is calculated in money, because money can be exchanged for necessities of life. If money cannot be exchanged or its exchange value is decreasing day by day, then workers will lose interest in monetary remuneration and will be willing to receive compensation in kind or in-kind payments to obtain what they need through exchange. If compensation can be made in kind, it is the most secure. We must recognize this point first.

(2) In the modern trend, labor and management are often out of sync. People in our country are affected by this and discriminate against those who run industries, often regarding them as capitalists or exploiters. This view is also wrong. Because our country's industry is still in its infancy, most manufacturers are struggling to operate, affected by internal turmoil and facing international competition. Their difficult situation is difficult to compare with the situation in other countries. Now, let us try to discuss the various aspects of factory authorities, technicians, and workers to see if their relationships are adversarial. In my humble opinion, since industry is the lifeblood of the country, it is of course very important. Those who run industries use their experience and intelligence to manage factories and do their best to put a large amount of human resources on the right track, engage in production, and create welfare. Their contribution is of great value, and their lifestyle is not overly extravagant. As for the shareholders who invest for profit, according to detailed statistics of the official profit dividends of several factories in recent years, the income is very small, and the facts are not difficult to understand. In short, among the general industrial leaders, although there may be some large capitalists, most of them can still prioritize their business and should not be placed entirely in the ranks of exploiters. As for engineers and technicians, they use their physical and mental labor to promote the development of factory affairs, and they are definitely laboring people, without any doubt. To sum up the relationship between these people, if we compare it to a family, then the factory leaders, managers, and technicians can be compared to older brothers; if we compare it to a school, they can be compared to the principal and teachers; the workers are like family members or students. They have a close relationship, share common interests, have no so-called boundaries, and should not have conflicts. At this difficult time, if we mistakenly believe that labor and management must be opposed and do not think of overcoming the crisis together, then we will all fall into a dead end, and it will be difficult to expect welfare. This point must be clearly understood first.

Based on the above opinions, I propose the following self-rescue methods:

(1) The Factory Side: The factory负责人负责人 and important cadres should immediately call the workers and have a sincere conversation to truly understand the current environment, and fully disclose the economic situation so that the authorities' sincerity and the difficulties they encounter are fully understood by the workers. Make a great determination together, and under the slogan of "As long as everyone has food to eat," work harder and increase production. As for the workers' daily food and the raw materials needed for production, the factory负责人负责人 should absolutely find ways to obtain them. For the food, if necessary, it may be possible to negotiate a loan from U.S. aid materials and exchange it at a price with the factory's existing or future finished products. Agricultural products or coal can be exchanged for machines needed in the morning villages, such as oil presses and grain harvesting machines, and machines needed in mines, such as water pumps and cranes, for daily use. As for raw materials, if funds are lacking for purchase, they should also be exchanged for existing or future finished products. However, this method must be actively supported and facilitated by the government, which is responsible for guaranteeing the credibility of the delivery of the finished products and their non-devaluing value. We firmly believe that this is the government's responsibility to the industrial community, and its assistance may even far exceed industrial loans, because there are no malpractices. In addition, if the factory needs small amounts of funds for purchasing grain and raw materials, it should ask the government to allow it to sell its future finished products to national banks in order to obtain funds to purchase grain or raw materials.

(2) The Worker Side: During this period, workers must obtain daily food and a minimum amount of pocket money. In view of the extraordinary environment, they should minimize their desires for life and convert their wages into finished products, that is, give them a corresponding portion of the finished products they have created. Therefore, although workers do not have a large amount of money income at present, they will definitely be able to obtain considerable materials in the future. In economic terms, it is like forced savings, which can follow market prices and are not afraid of devaluation, while encouraging increased production, which is very beneficial.

In my humble opinion, this method is the most reasonable and will definitely be effective. If it can be implemented, no matter what difficulties there are, production can definitely be maintained, not only creating welfare for people and achieving the goal, but also eliminating all malpractices such as stimulating prices and purchasing gold. Factories will not go bankrupt, workers can avoid unemployment, social crises will be eliminated, and national strength will be increased. The welfare of the country and the people depends on it. However, what is mentioned in this article is only a principle. When it comes to the specific methods and technical details of implementation, various parties should formulate them in detail according to the actual situation in order to be practical and appropriate. Moreover, personal ideals are incomplete, and it is difficult to achieve results alone. I hope that all colleagues will have considerable interest in this method, supplement it and promote it. What is especially hoped is that the government, which has always been enthusiastic about promoting industry, must effectively guarantee the effectiveness and redemption of future bills of sale for finished products sold when selling future goods and purchasing raw materials on credit, or for certificates given to workers for finished products (for example, if a worker at a certain ink factory has a wage of 1,000 yuan, excluding 200 yuan for food, the 800 yuan should be converted into a certain number of bottles of ink, and the factory should issue a certificate, which is called a finished product certificate or ownership certificate), so that the general use of the futures bill is the same as a non-devaluing counter, and the belief in the endorsement exceeds the limited gold. If this method can be successfully promoted and achieve good results, then all the pain caused by currency and all the difficulties suffered by the industrial community will be relieved, and there will be no worries. What do colleagues think?

### It's Not Easy to Live in Hong Kong: Severe Housing Shortage, Rising Costs, No Way to Invest, "Refugees Are Depressed"

[This Newspaper] According to a passenger who returned to Shanghai by plane from Hong Kong yesterday, the recent situation in Hong Kong is as follows: (1) Within the past one or two months, due to the influx of a large number of people, the housing shortage in Hong Kong and Kowloon has become severe. All houses, large and small, require premium fees, and the prices are very high. Roughly speaking, for a modern house with three or four rooms, you can't expect to inquire without having 8,000 to 10,000 Hong Kong dollars. As for hotels, there are very few empty rooms in large hotels, so let's not talk about them. Even a third-class hotel requires 80 to 90 Hong Kong dollars a day, including food and accommodation, which shows how difficult it is. (2) Due to the large influx of people, there are few who produce and many who consume. Everyone feels that the cost of general daily life is difficult. Generally speaking, ordinary prices have risen about 20 times compared to before the war. It costs four yuan a bowl to eat an approximately full bowl of beef congee. You can imagine the rest. (3) Among the new entrants, most are from Beijing and Shanghai. There are, of course, many "high-class refugees," but there are also many mid-level civil servants who came south on assignments or with agencies. Most of these people arrived a month ago and brought their families and all their luggage. However, because they cannot afford to pay the premium for housing, they have to stay in hotels temporarily. At first, they thought they had entered paradise, but now, because there are more and more "refugees," their lives are greatly threatened, and they are already unable to support themselves. (4) Those who move into the high-class refugees later naturally have larger burdens and expenses than those who arrived earlier. Moreover, the ways to choose to invest in production are also proportionally narrower day by day. The money they bring is only being consumed and no interest is being generated. Over time, they feel depressed day by day and believe that they are not allowed to stay for long. When these people first entered the country, they only felt refreshed in body and mind. Looking north at the raging flames, they suddenly felt "fortunate to have left early." However, as time goes by and their capital decreases day by day, their thoughts of missing the real estate they left behind in the Beijing and Shanghai areas become more and more intense. Now, there are those who eagerly hope that the government will win the war and think of returning home, and there are also those who can't bear to read the Hong Kong versions of Wenhui Bao and Ta Kung Pao. Is it patriotism? Or is it worrying about the property they left behind in their motherland? Although it is impossible to know, it is very obvious that these people have inner distress.

### Hong Kong Holds Riot Drill, Lasting One Week Starting Tomorrow

### President Truman Implements New Deal; Formulates Social Welfare Plan; Relieves the Poor, Elderly, and Infirm; Increases Education Expenses; Attends to People's Health and Solves Housing Shortage

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] According to reliable sources: President Truman is planning to add a department to the Cabinet to guide a large-scale social welfare program to make the American people healthier and happier. The establishment of this ministry will be approved by Congress. Observers believe that the new Democratic Congress will support it. Administration officials told United Press that President Truman will ask Congress to establish a new social welfare department. This letter will be submitted immediately after Congress opens on January 3 next year. Closely related to the social welfare plan is the short-term housing plan. The president and his aides hope to extend rent control for at least another year and have the government support the construction of low-cost, low-rent housing. In some respects, Truman's social welfare plan even exceeds that proposed by the late President Roosevelt, including: (1) Expanding social security benefits to millions of people who are not currently benefiting, and increasing subsidies for the poor and elderly. (2) A long-term national health plan, including health insurance, to provide adequate medical care to millions of people who are not currently able to afford it, with the goal of "extending basic health services and making them accessible to all people." (3) Increasing federal subsidies to states for building hospitals and other medical facilities, as well as medical research. (4) Increasing federal education subsidies, including funding for school buildings, teacher salaries, and other activities. (5) The government may provide subsidies to medical graduate students to solve the current shortage of physicians. Officials claim that the number of physicians nationwide is only 80 percent of what is needed. If the president's plan is implemented, the government's annual social welfare budget will increase by hundreds of millions of dollars. The current budget is already 1 billion, but the required expenses may be offset by increased social security taxes. In the current fiscal year, Congress has already appropriated $1,245,160,000 for the government's social welfare and education activities. Congress is likely to largely approve the president's increased request.

### Responds to the Neutral Nations Committee; Soviet Government States Its Position; Willing to Provide Information for Berlin Currency System Research; Security Council Has No Right to Interfere in Political Disputes

[United Press, Paris, 4th] Radio Moscow broadcast a TASS dispatch on the 4th, providing a detailed response to the proposal by Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia to establish a "neutral" committee, and clarifying the "Soviet position." The Soviet Union agreed to provide "necessary information" while the neutral countries worked on the Berlin currency system research committee, but refused the committee's mediation in the Berlin dispute.

This TASS dispatch included the following points: (1) Although the Soviet Union is willing to provide information, it is rather indifferent to the research of the currency system. (2) Completely rejects Bramuglia's proposed "mediation" or "supervisory" committee. (3) The United States and France have stated that currency experts should consider the recent situation in Berlin. TASS said that "As for the other issues related to Berlin raised by Bramuglia in the past few days, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky's speech in the Security Council can represent the Soviet Union's response to these issues." Vyshinsky stated the Soviet Union's attitude as follows: (1) The Security Council has no right to interfere in the Berlin issue; (2) The Berlin issue should be resolved by the four occupying powers. Western spokesmen said that the Soviet statement did not help the situation. They believe that as long as the Soviet Union does not stop dividing Berlin, Bramuglia's "last attempt" will not take effect. The West is currently drafting a supplementary memorandum to submit to the experts, detailing the Soviet Union's actions that have made the Berlin situation intolerable.

### Former U.S. Fleet Commander Warns Not to Underestimate Soviet Military Strength; Soviet Union Accuses U.S. of Using Japan as a Tool to Invade the Soviet Union

[United Press, Monterey, California, 3rd] Retired four-star admiral Spruance, who served as commander of the Fifth Fleet during the war, told reporters on the 3rd that he warned the United States not to underestimate Soviet military strength. Spruance said, "Unless we become much stronger and Western Europe becomes much stronger, I don't want to meet the Soviet army on the battlefield. Their army is large and strong." Regarding the Soviet navy, Spruance said, "What we need to fear is the Soviet submarine. He requested that modern submarines have completely become a new problem in naval warfare. Spruance continued: (1) If China falls into the hands of the communists, then Southeast Asia and its abundant strategic raw materials will also fall into the hands of the communists. (2) Given time, the unification of the army, navy, and air force will take effect. But if the air force does not separate from the army, then he is more in favor of it. (3) The air force cannot independently adapt to the needs of future wars, and the navy cannot rely entirely on aircraft carriers.

[United Press, Moscow, 3rd] Imayev wrote in the "Red Fleet" newspaper, sponsored by the Soviet Navy, today that MacArthur's reconstruction of a modern base for the U.S. Navy at the Yokosuka naval port in Japan is tantamount to the U.S. holding a gun to the chest of the various ethnic groups in Asia. The U.S. occupation authorities are also encouraging the revival of Japanese militarism and intend to use Japan as a tool to invade Asia and the Soviet Union. After expanding Japan's police force and reorganizing the Japanese army, the United States is now preparing to allow Japan to restore its navy.

### US Un-American Activities Committee Intercepts Secret Soviet Spy Documents

Submitted by Former Communist Party Member Chambers

[United Press International Washington, 3rd] House investigators stated on the evening of the 3rd that Chambers, who confessed to being a former Communist Party member, had provided them with copies of "hundreds of" secret documents that had been stolen from the State Department by Communist underground operatives before 1938.

Mundt further stated that these documents were given to Chambers "to be handed over to a Soviet Communist Party spy." Mundt did not specify who gave the documents to Chambers. Mundt's official statement was issued to reporters by the committee's lawyer, Stripling, and stated that the importance of the documents handed over by Chambers to the committee and the revelation of the vastness of the Communist spy organization within the State Department far exceeded anything the committee had obtained in its ten-year history. According to Stripling, the documents were handed over by Chambers on the evening of the 2nd at his Westminster farm, and were photographic reductions. Mundt continued that the committee is now keeping these documents under 24-hour surveillance, and that these documents have been the object of a ten-year search by US government agents.

### UN Political Committee Passes British Proposal to Establish a Mediation Committee for the Holy Land; Bunche to Visit Authorities in Arab and Jewish Regions in the Middle East

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 4th] The UN Political Committee this morning passed the British proposal to establish a Palestine Mediation Committee by a vote of 25 to 21 with 9 abstentions. However, the passage of this proposal does not meet the one-third vote required for the UN to pass resolutions, so any decision on Palestine by the General Assembly must be revised or a new proposal put forward. Before the vote on this proposal, the Political Committee passed the Canadian amendment by a vote of 24 to 21 with 8 abstentions, which stipulates that the three-member committee of the Mediation Committee should be designated by a special committee that includes members from China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union.

### Asian Economic Conference Discusses Japanese Economic Problems

US Representative Advocates Expanding Japanese Production

[Central News Agency Lake Success, 4th] Whitman, the US Deputy Representative to the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, said at the meeting today that the United States firmly believes that Japan's economic self-sufficiency to maintain its minimum living standard is a necessary condition for ensuring the security of the Far East. When discussing Japan's economic problems, he said that in order for Japan to survive in the world as a peaceful and free nation, it must rebuild its foreign trade. Currently, Japan's industrial production is only half of its capacity, so even within the existing policies of the Economic Commission for the Far East, there is still great room for expansion of Japanese production. Furthermore, he believes that restoring Japan's foreign trade will enable Japan to be self-sufficient at a minimum living standard and thus develop its domestic industries.

### Tojo's Final Words Actually Advocate Non-War

Believes War Cannot Resolve Disputes

However, the nature of these final words is an appeal to people from all over the world. In his final words, Tojo emphasized that war is not an effective way to resolve international disputes. Tojo wrote these words when he was preparing to commit suicide after the surrender, but because he did not die immediately, they have not been published until now."

### Allied Experts to Complete Economic Revival Plan for Japan by Mid-Week; Goal is to Make Japan Self-Sufficient

[United Press International Washington, 4th] Experts from the Allied Budget Committee are expected to complete the detailed content of the economic revival plan by mid-week, which aims to make Japan self-sufficient in a few years. Although the committee members refused to discuss their activities, according to UPI from reliable sources, the scope of the Budget Committee's activities includes: (1) The committee will present the results of its thorough research on Japan achieving a semi-self-sufficient economy in a relatively short period of time; (2) Propose budget allocations for the initial stage of Japan's revival; (3) The initial stage will focus on expanding the import of industrial raw materials. Although the import of raw materials will be expanded in the initial stage, the committee and all relevant agencies in Washington are focusing on every aspect of Japan's import and export economy from the perspective of increasing Japan's exports to the maximum extent to pay for its imports. The plan proposed by the committee will include all the details, but because its opinions are directly related to funding, they will not be disclosed. However, well-informed sources pointed out that Japan must import basic industrial raw materials such as oil, iron ore, pig iron, coal, lead, tin, natural rubber, zinc, nickel, aluminum ore, wool, and cotton. Although these people did not predict the number of years in the "relatively short period" or the detailed content of imports and exports, they pointed out that the committee's plan may be based on the recent speech by Lubin. According to Lubin: "Japan's exports have increased in the past year, reaching US$200 million, but before they can pay for the food and raw materials necessary to maintain Japan's low living standards, they must increase the current amount seven to eight times." Well-informed sources said: The committee's revival plan will help Japan gradually achieve self-sufficiency, saving the United States at least US$400 million annually.

### Shigeru Yoshida Strongly Advocates Holding Re-elections to Establish a Japanese Democratic Government; Indicates Decision to Dissolve the House of Representatives After Mid-Month

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 4th] Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida expressed his determination to dissolve the Japanese House of Representatives after mid-month when he addressed the parliament this afternoon. He said: Japan needs to sign a peace treaty as soon as possible in order to achieve independence. If Japan does not have a real democratic government, then a peace treaty cannot be expected. A democratic government can only be established through another general election. When he addressed the plenary session of the House of Representatives in the afternoon, he pointed out that the one-and-a-half-year period since the first election after the enactment of the new Japanese constitution "was a period of political instability."

He also said: "Workers are becoming increasingly powerful, the national economy is declining, and production is far below expectations." He said that the establishment of his minority cabinet and the political situation in Japan both require elections to stabilize Japan's extremely chaotic political situation after the war. He emphasized that without another election, a true democratic government cannot be firmly established in Japan, and without a firmly established democratic government, a peace treaty cannot be expected. He revealed that, according to the agreement reached between the government and the opposition parties, the House of Representatives will be dissolved two weeks after the government submits the supplementary budget and the bill to revise wage standards.

### US West Coast Shipping Resumes; Aid to China Materials to Be Shipped Out as Soon as Possible; USS Meigs to Sail to Shanghai First

[Central News Agency San Francisco, 3rd] Several cargo ships that have been stranded on the Pacific coast since September 2nd will sail to the Far East next week, as the 93-day dockworkers' strike officially ended today. The duration of this strike was second only to the labor unrest in 1936, when dockworkers on the Pacific coast went on strike for 98 days. The end of this labor unrest was the result of 22 days of negotiations between labor and management. Shipping companies said today that 50% of the cargo ships will sail to the Far East next week, resuming maritime transportation on the Pacific. The first liner to sail to Shanghai will be the USS Meigs, which is scheduled to depart around the 17th of this month. A total of 265 ships were stranded on the Pacific coast during the three months of this strike, including 70 docked in San Francisco. It is expected that after the resumption of shipping, the transportation of aid to China materials will be accelerated. Some aid to China materials here have been shipped from Galveston, Texas, but it takes almost two weeks longer than the San Francisco-Shanghai route.

### West Berlin Elections Today; Can Observe German Political Trends; British Members of Parliament Invited to Observe

[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 3rd] A group of British members of the lower house of parliament invited by the British military government to observe the municipal elections here has arrived today, including two Conservative Party members and several Labour Party members.

### Communist Forces in Asia

— Translated by 礝石

The author of this article, Joseph Fromm, is an experienced journalist who is the Far East correspondent for "US News & World Report" magazine. Since the end of World War II, he has been assigned to the Far East. He has traveled to Japan, North China, Indochina, Indonesia, Malaya, Burma, and India. During his travels, he had many conversations with officials, soldiers, and politicians from various places. Now, he published this article on October 1st, providing a comprehensive report on the expansion of Soviet forces in Asia.

While Communist forces in Europe are temporarily calmer, Communist forces in Asia are rising. Since the past six months, Communist forces have been expanding very successfully. Judging from this success, Asia has a very high possibility of becoming Communist Asia, although there is no possibility of achieving this goal by next year or the year after, but it may be completed within five or ten years at least.

At the same time, the credibility and influence of the United States in the Far East are declining. In Japan, China, the Philippines, Indochina, Malaya, the East Indies, Burma, and India, it is clearly showing that the United States and the West are losing their position in the Cold War due to self-deception. In this vast area with a population of one billion, nationalism and independence movements are now popular.

The main reason for the success of communism in Asia is the lack of a definite decision-making process for the Far East by the United States and Western powers. When the United States provided a large amount of aid to Japan, agitators took the opportunity to incite those areas that had previously been occupied by Japan. At the same time, they engaged in inciting the natives of various regions to launch independence movements to resist France, Britain, and the Netherlands.

Due to oppression, poverty, and the inability of farmers to live and cultivate peacefully, nationalism and communist ideas arose. The Soviet Union took advantage of this weakness to gain friends in various parts of Asia and cultivate its potential. In order to gain friendship in Europe, the United States had to support the colonial authorities, so the Soviet Union took advantage of this point and promised to provide assistance in various ways to the native rebellions.

The offensive launched by the Communist authorities in various Asian countries varies with the environment. In Indochina and Indonesia, the offensive adopted by the Communists is the nationalist movement, and they have also armed those liberals who dreamed that the United States could support them after the end of the war against Japan.

In China, the Communist Party has seized areas with a population of 150 million. The offensive they launched is the so-called land reform, which is praised by the masses, and encourages farmers to participate in the war of liquidation against landlords.

In Malaya, small and armed communist parties have launched a fierce war against Britain. At that time, the Communists in Burma were also leading an armed war against the socialist government.

The Communist Asian Intelligence Bureau is the mastermind of this movement, and the Soviet Union took the opportunity to cultivate anti-American sentiment among the people in the region. In the early days of the end of the war, the United States had a high reputation in Asia, but now its reputation is gradually declining.

Many people in Asian colonies and others had a hope for the situation of Japan's defeat, because according to the Four-Power Declaration and the Pacific Charter, the people of the colonies could no longer be oppressed, and they could also gain autonomy. Due to the United States' policy toward Asia during the war, this deeply convinced the people of Asia of the United States. They thought that when peace came, the United States would fight for the independence and freedom of the colonial people of Asia.

However, the focus of post-war American diplomacy was on European reconstruction and preventing the expansion of Soviet power into Western Europe. As a result, all decisions regarding Asia were classified as secondary and often mistaken by the American authorities. Although the United States has almost lost all its allies in Asia today, American foreign policy has not turned around. There will be a Communist Asia in the world, but the United States seems to be unaware of this future threat, and its eyes are only focused on Europe. (To be continued)

### SS Kiang Ya Explodes and Sinks; Most of 3,000 Passengers Missing; About 1,000 Survivors; Cause of Accident Being Investigated

[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Shanghai-Ningbo line passenger ship, the SS Kiang Ya, departed from Shanghai for Ningbo at 4 p.m. the day before yesterday. At around 7 p.m., while sailing in the waters of Litongsha Yang outside Songkou, it suddenly exploded and sank. Most of the 3,000 passengers on board were killed or injured. With the cooperation of all parties, the rescue efforts continued from that night until yesterday. As of last night, about 1,000 people had been rescued and arrived in Shanghai. The exact number of people who drowned at sea is still unknown. According to the total number of tickets sold by the company and the possible number of additional "scalped" passengers, it is estimated that the number of deaths is around 2,000. As for the cause of the accident, there are various rumors, and the actual cause is still under investigation.

The SS Kiang Ya was acquired by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company from the Japanese company Toa Kaiun Kabushiki Kaisha and renamed from the Kōa Maru. It was one of the largest passenger ships on the company's Shanghai-Ningbo line, with a speed of 14 knots per hour, a length of 340.4 feet, a width of 50 feet, and a deadweight of 2,099 tons. It originally had 28 special class cabins, 36 first class cabins, 46 second class cabins, 555 third class cabins, and 571 fourth class cabins, with a total capacity of 1,186 passengers. After renovation, the Maritime Bureau passenger license allowed for 2,250 passengers.

### Loud Noise Suddenly Heard from the Stern; Sinks Within Three Minutes

On this trip from Shanghai to Ningbo, a total of 2,207 tickets were sold and there were 191 crew members. It set sail at 4 p.m. the day before yesterday, and at around 7 p.m. it passed through the waterway east of Bailonggang, southwest of Hengsha (121.47 degrees north latitude, 31.15 degrees east longitude). A loud noise suddenly came from the stern, and an extremely strong explosion occurred near the third cabin on the right side, reaching the three-story deck in the rear. In an instant, the lights inside the ship went out. The motor stopped, and the stern began to sink rapidly, submerging into the water within three minutes. The middle and front of the ship also gradually sank. When the crew members realized that there was an accident, there was no way to save the situation, and because the radio station had been destroyed, it was impossible to send out a distress signal. At that time, most of the passengers in the third class cabins near the explosion had no way to escape. The first, second, special class cabins and the fourth class passengers on the deck were awakened by the loud explosion. Knowing the ship was in danger, they witnessed the ship gradually being swallowed by the waves. In the vast sea, it was dark, and they were immediately shocked and at a loss, crying and screaming. In the chaos, some jumped into the sea, some scrambled for lifeboats, and some gathered on the front mast and chimney, countless of whom were swept away by the waves. In the final moments, only the highest deck in the front was still exposed above the water. Fortunately, the Wah Foong Company's Wah Foong ship was passing by. But the Wah Foong ship did not initially notice the Kiang Ya accident in the darkness. Passengers on the Kiang Ya urgently used flashlights to send out distress signals, and the Wah Foong ship approached to rescue, while also sending out distress signals on behalf of the Wah Foong.

### Receiving Telegrams; Sending Ships to Rescue

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received this telegram at around 9 p.m. that night and immediately dispatched four ships, the Chiu Chin, Chi An, Kiang Tsing, and Hai Tsing, to the rescue. It also requested the Chinese navy to send the Mount Omei warship and the US Navy to send two warships to the rescue. At the same time, ships such as the Kin Yuan Li, Mao Li, and fishing boats and sailing ships that were passing by also went to the rescue after hearing the news. Yesterday morning, the company again sent the head of the maritime affairs department, Fan Lun, leading two tugboats, Tuan Chiang and Kuo Shan, towing two large iron barges, along with more than 50 divers and workers to the accident site to continue the rescue efforts.

### More Than Sixty Crew Members Missing

As of last night, about 1,000 passengers had been rescued and sent to Shanghai by various ships. The injured have been sent to hospitals such as the Kung Tsi, Jen Chi, and China-America hospitals for treatment. Among the senior crew members rescued were shipowner Shen Dacai, Chief Officer Zhu Jinchang, Chief Engineer Hu Caiyang, Third Engineer Zhang Qingfang, Business Director Zheng Shouye, and radio operator Tu Zheng. Those missing include Chief Engineer Wang Wenchao, Second Engineer Zhang Fubao, Chief Radio Operator Han Yucheng, and more than sixty junior crew members.

### Diverse Speculation About the Cause of the Accident

Regarding the circumstances of the accident, the shipowner has already reported to the company and forwarded it to the Maritime Bureau yesterday, and the cause of the accident will be thoroughly investigated. According to the shipowner, when the ship arrived at the accident site, two small civilian ships were found on the direct route ahead. At that time, they were instructed to leave by signal. Initially, the two ships ignored the signal, but after another signal was sent, they complied and sailed away. At this time, the explosion occurred. But it is difficult to explain whether the two ships were related to the explosion. As for the location of the explosion, it is said that it was not inside the boiler room, so the theory of a boiler explosion is not reliable. It is also rumored that criminals on the ship planted time bombs, or that dozens of soldiers carrying military equipment were on board, and the explosion was caused by the military equipment. However, these are all speculations and not credible. In short, the cause of the accident still needs to be investigated and studied.

### A Sea of Cries in Front of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company

Since the tragedy of the ship occurred, the families of the passengers were shocked and panicked when they heard the news. Yesterday, hundreds of people went to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to inquire about the news, and many women were crying and weeping in front of the company, which was a heartbreaking sight. According to the company's person in charge, regarding the aftermath, the company recently insured the passengers' safety with an insurance company. The medical expenses of the injured will be borne by the company. Passengers who were rescued and wish to continue to Ningbo can take the company's Kiang Tsing ship from Shanghai for free tomorrow, otherwise they can get a refund of the ticket fee. The company will pay more attention to the issue of navigation safety in the future. The total amount of the loss is currently unable to be estimated.

### Three Requests from the Families of the Victims

[Another News] This newspaper received a letter from a reader named Zhuan Qizhao yesterday, stating that his mother was also on the ship, and her fate is still unknown as of last night.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Line Passenger Ships Changed to One Trip Every Other Day

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai-Ningbo line passenger ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were originally the Kiang Ya and Kiang Tsing ships. Except for Sundays, they sailed between Shanghai and Ningbo every day at 4:30 p.m. Now, because only one ship is operating after the accident of the Kiang Ya ship, it has been changed to one trip every other day, departing at 6 a.m. Therefore, the Kiang Tsing ship did not depart yesterday, but will depart for Ningbo at 6 a.m. this morning.

The representatives presented the various difficulties faced by the industries, especially the paper-making and electrical industries, which are suffering from a sharp drop in finished product prices and extremely high wages, making it difficult to delay. Under these emergency circumstances, if the government does not provide prompt relief, it will inevitably affect social stability. They requested the immediate release of emergency industrial loans to meet the urgent needs of factories and requested allocation of funds to purchase finished products from various industries, or loans for ordering goods. After careful consideration, Vice President Liu decided in principle to grant loans. As for all procedures, interest rates, and the total amount of the loan, they will be submitted to the committee for discussion tomorrow.

### Over a Thousand Refugee Students Leaving for Jiangxi

[Our Report] Over a thousand refugee students from Henan and Shandong in Shanghai planned to take the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to go to Jiangxi, but the passenger cars were crowded and there was no way to accommodate them. Until 4:00 AM yesterday, the two railway bureaus specially allocated more than twenty cars to form a train for the students to go to Jiangxi. Due to a shortage of locomotives, the train was delayed in departing. The refugee students, unable to wait any longer, flocked to the station master's office to negotiate and urge the departure. Due to a misunderstanding in language, they clashed with the on-duty station master, Zhang Xikun, who was beaten and injured in the head. The station master's office was also vandalized. Later, the station police arrived to suppress the situation and promised to depart the train immediately, and the dispute was resolved. The train borrowed the locomotive from the Shanghai-Nanjing train number 52 and departed at 5:38 AM.

### Rent Increases Are Staggering: Directly Threatening the Livelihoods of Ordinary People and Will Affect Social Order; Tenants' Union to Formulate Countermeasures Today

When the "August 19th" Financial Emergency Decree was promulgated, the standard for rents across the country was originally scheduled to be drafted and implemented by the central government in a unified manner. Later, due to the revision of the price control policy, this new standard has not yet been announced. In this city, although the city council had requested the Land Administration Bureau to implement the standard in June of this year, limiting business premises to nine thousand times the pre-war level and residential premises to seven thousand times the pre-war level, this standard, according to the council's original resolution, expired at the end of September this year. After October, there was no basis for calculating rents, and rental disputes have sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain. Director Zhu of the Land Administration Bureau had previously publicly stated that he hoped that all rent disputes would be resolved through negotiations between landlords and tenants to make reasonable adjustments. Unexpectedly, some real estate owners have used this as an excuse to unilaterally increase rents recently. The entire board of directors of the Shanghai Tenants' Union believes that this illegal rent increase not only directly threatens the livelihoods of ordinary people but will also affect the entire social order, which must not be ignored. It has already notified all its member representatives and invited members of the press in the city to hold a symposium on rent issues at 3:00 PM today at the Daguan Society at 354 Nanjing West Road to discuss reasonable solutions to the rent issue, so that they can act in unison, appeal to all sectors for assistance, oppose unreasonable rent increases, maintain the livelihoods of ordinary people, and stabilize social order. It is reported that the proposed increase in rents by real estate owners in this city this time is staggering and is widespread among middle and lower-class houses, which will have a very serious threat to the livelihoods of ordinary people. For example, a tenant representative said that the monthly rent of each building in Cha Li, Tian Tong Road, Zhejiang North Road, managed by Yi Pin Bank, was only 1.5 million legal tender before the "August 19th" currency reform. Recently, all tenants were suddenly notified that, starting from September, the rent would be adjusted to more than 190 gold yuan per month, an increase of about 400 times.

### Mayor Wu and Commander Chen Jointly Entertain the Press

Mayor Wu Guozhen and Songhu Garrison Commander Chen Daqing hosted the local press yesterday at 5:00 PM to exchange views. More than 30 heads of newspapers, including Pan Gongzhan, attended. First, Fang Zhi reported on his visit to Beijing to comfort the Air Force, saying: The first priority for suppressing bandits in the front is victory, and the first priority for the people in the rear is calmness. They have now scheduled to visit Bengbu next Monday to comfort the troops, and they hope that citizens will actively donate items. Then, Pan Gongzhan gave a speech, saying: In order to seek permanent freedom, we should temporarily restrain excessive freedom, and he suggested that the authorities should inspect the mail to prevent printed materials that promote bandits from spreading among the people and confusing people's minds. Mayor Wu said: In this extraordinary period, I hope the press will understand the government's difficulties in implementing various measures, and I hope the people will strengthen their faith. Commander Chen, in addition to detailing the factors that will lead to victory in the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, also advocated for the dispersal of unemployed vagrants who do not engage in production to stabilize society. The meeting ended at 6:30 PM.

In addition to jointly hosting the press with Mayor Wu, the newly appointed Garrison Commander Chen Daqing also held his first press conference in the auditorium of the headquarters at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon.

### 50,000 Cigarette Workers in the City Request Tax Relief to Maintain Livelihoods

Due to the recent impact of the war, the scope of foreign sales has been greatly reduced, resulting in overproduction and a sharp drop in market prices. Just as cigarette manufacturers in the city were struggling to maintain their operations, the Ministry of Finance suddenly announced on the 1st of this month that it would increase the cigarette tax by seven times, further increasing their difficulties. Cigarettes that originally sold for 7,000 yuan per carton must now be sold for 49,000 yuan after the tax increase, but even at 6,000 yuan, there are few buyers. Therefore, many cigarette factories have suspended operations due to their inability to operate, and there are many rumors of bankruptcy. The 50,000 cigarette workers in the city, whose livelihoods have been directly affected by this increase in cigarette tax, discussed ways to make a living at the Cigarette Workers' Welfare Association yesterday. They unanimously passed a resolution to send eleven representatives, including Zhou Xuexiang, Cheng Shunxing, and Chen Sanlian, permanent members of the association, to petition the Direct Taxation Bureau and the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau, requesting a gradual increase in taxes to overcome the current difficulties. It is said that if they do not achieve their goals, they will go to Beijing to directly petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance.

### Partial Reimbursement of Rice for Cloth: Rice Industry Association Submits Application for Review

The Rice Merchants Association of this city received 20,000 bolts of cloth from the Economic Supervision Office during its management period, stipulating that it should exchange them for 30,000 piculs of white rice from rice-producing areas to transport to Shanghai to supply food to the people. However, after the end of the association's management work, there has been no concrete reimbursement, and the stipulated 20% of white rice to be handed over to the People's Mediation Committee has also not been complied with. Under the separate orders of the Social Affairs Bureau and the People's Mediation Committee, the industry association has submitted a register of sold rice yesterday. The purchasing units include the first and third branch offices of the association and the Rice Milling Industry Association, which purchased a total of 4,110 dan before October 20 and 7,329 dan before October 20. The amount purchased by the second branch office has not yet been submitted and is currently being urged by the People's Mediation Committee.

### Minor Opium Cases Scheduled to Begin Hearing Tomorrow

[Our Report] The Law on Punishing Opium and Drug Trafficking has been passed and promulgated by the Legislative Yuan, and the implementation period has been extended by one year. However, the city's district court has not yet received a formal order as of yesterday. In order to expedite the closing of cases, the district court has decided to begin hearing minor opium cases first, starting tomorrow. The remaining major cases will also be heard successively. The major opium cases include the case of Wang Zhibin, a legislator of the Democratic Socialist Party, who transported a large amount of opium from Beiping to Shanghai. According to the judge in charge of opium cases at the district court yesterday, Wang Zhibin's case was caught on the spot when he got off the plane, and the facts of his crime are very clear.

At around 2:00 PM, twelve people reported to the Water Police Bureau.

### Three Generations Head to Ningbo, Grandchildren Die Tragically, Five Lives Lost, Rescued Woman Tells of Abandoning Child to Save Herself

[Report from this Newspaper] When the Jiangya Wheel encountered disaster and sank at Qiutongsha, a Fei family of six, spanning three generations, from Cian Lane, Malang Road, also boarded the ship to Ningbo. The six people were the grandfather, daughter-in-law, three grandchildren, and the daughter-in-law's father. Now, only the daughter-in-law has survived. According to the daughter-in-law, the circumstances of the accident, her escape, and her rescue were too tragic to bear. When the ship exploded, it was after 8:00 PM. There was a loud bang, and the whole ship shook. Knowing that something terrible had happened, Mrs. Fei reluctantly abandoned her nursing infant in the third-class cabin and rushed to the deck with her four- and six-year-old children to escape. By then, the ship was in complete chaos. Her own father followed his daughter to escape, but they were soon separated in the chaos, their fates unknown. Her father-in-law's berth was said to be close to the site of the explosion, so he was likely also killed. When Mrs. Fei reached the deck with her two children, there was another loud bang, and the ship quickly sank into the water. The mother and children struggled in the water for half an hour, close to drowning, when a rescue ship arrived. They saw her hair floating on the surface, but they could not pull her up by her hair. So, they threw a rope for her to grab. But with two children in her hands, she could not hold onto the rope. She had no choice but to painfully throw one child into the water, freeing one hand to hold the rope. But the strength of one hand was not enough to climb up. Finally, she threw the second child into the water as well, grabbed the rope with both hands, and managed to climb up to safety. Out of the whole family of six, she was the only one who was rescued and returned yesterday morning. Both arms were severely injured. When she recounted her experience of abandoning her children to save herself, she was overcome with grief. It was truly a tragic scene in this world.

### Labor Disputes Decreased, Bureau Explains, Two Reasons

[Report from this Newspaper] Labor disputes in Shanghai have gradually decreased recently. According to the person in charge of the Labor Office of the Social Bureau yesterday, the reasons are: first, the government implemented martial law, and workers are not allowed to strike or go on strike; second, the cost of living has increased, and workers' lives have improved compared to the past. Currently, most of the disputes that occur are due to factories being unable to maintain operations and requesting to suspend operations and lay off workers, and the industries with the most disputes are machinery, silk weaving, knitting, light bulbs, and glass. The Social Bureau is making every effort to mediate these disputes, hoping that both labor and management will adopt a spirit of understanding and seek appropriate solutions.

### Confidence Firm, Credit Looser: Rice Prices Surged Yesterday, Flour, Grain, Oil, and Cakes Generally Rose, Market Sentiment Buoyant

The rice market rebounded sharply yesterday, with a strong upward trend. Because the household rice price was similar to the market price, people's confidence immediately turned firm. Coupled with the continued loosening of credit and rising prices reported from the production areas, rice shops saw active sales and strengthened capital turnover, leading to exceptionally buoyant trading at the start of the day. The Nanshi market saw a particularly strong upward trend, opening with a call of 100 yuan higher, softening slightly at the close, but ultimately seeing a gain of 70 to 80 yuan. Superior japonica and thin indica each traded outside of 400 yuan, at 420 yuan. The Beishi market saw a slightly weaker upward trend than the Nanshi market, with superior japonica and thin indica each opening at 400 yuan, gaining 50 yuan. Indica rice rose 30 to 40 yuan. Total arrivals at the two markets amounted to 8,787 shi.

Flour rebounded sharply. Due to the sharp rise in rice prices, people's sentiment was excited and bullish. With credit having loosened and capital turnover strengthened, the market opened with a significant surge. Lao Che brand flour reached a high of 141 yuan, and Bingshan flour saw 130 yuan. At the close, profits were taken at the higher prices, with Lao Che closing at 130 yuan and Bingshan at 124 yuan, each up 15 to 16 yuan. Miscellaneous brands of flour all rose by about 15 percent, and bran rose by 12 yuan.

With the rebound in rice prices, sentiment for coarse grains was firm and bullish, and cargo owners held on to their goods. Soybeans ultimately rose by 20 yuan. Corn and red sorghum saw active trading and each rose by more than 20 yuan. Sorted green beans rose by 10 yuan, green beans rose firmly, sesame rose by 30 to 40 yuan, and raw kernels were actively purchased by the Guangdong trading houses, rising by 40 to 50 yuan.

Edible oil rose across the board. With rice prices rising sharply, people's sentiment turned firm, credit loosened, and capital turnover strengthened. Soybean oil factories opened at 720 yuan, and rapeseed oil at 600 yuan, before spot prices reached 610 yuan, each up 100 yuan. Jibao brand raw oil rose by 120 yuan, closing at 840 yuan. Xiaoche sesame oil rose by 60 yuan, and soybean cake rose by 10 yuan across the board.

### Tea Market Weak and Unable to Recover

The tea market's weakness continues to spread. The reason for this is that since cargo owners have been eager for funds and willing to sell red and green tea at discounted prices, buyers have been relentlessly cutting prices, leading to a weakening market sentiment and a downward trend in prices. Transactions remain limited, as general sentiment remains bearish, so buying interest has not yet developed.

### Sugar Market Apparently Firm but Actually Weak

Sugar futures opened at 380 yuan yesterday morning, but with few takers, the market trended downwards, ultimately closing at 355 yuan, a gain of 15 yuan from the previous session. Coarse sand rose by 30 yuan, to 33 yuan. Other grades also generally showed improvement from the previous session. However, yesterday was Saturday, and trading was for the opening positions of the coming week, with two days' worth of interest for the weekend. Therefore, although yesterday's trading was brisk, it was actually apparently firm but actually weak. Credit in the industry has turned looser, and underground interest rates have also fallen to 20 to 25 yuan per thousand yuan per day.

### Yarn and Cloth Firm and Brisk; Market Scheduled to Resume Tomorrow

Yesterday's yarn market saw credit gradually loosen, prices for various commodities outside the industry rise, and the cotton yarn market scheduled to officially convene and trade on Monday (the 6th). People's confidence rose sharply. Furthermore, with news of military victories spreading, large Guangdong trading houses continued to seek and purchase goods for transport south, and buying interest was strong, leading to a buoyant market trend.

42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened at a high price of 600 yuan, with those holding goods taking the opportunity to sell. Near the close, prices were called back to 11,400 yuan, an increase of 800 yuan from the previous day.

21-count Double Horse yarn, due to strong demand, once briefly broke through the 10,000 yuan mark before closing at 9,800 yuan, a sharp rise of 1,800 yuan. Single Double Horse yarn traded around 9,000 yuan, ultimately closing at 9,100 yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also generally rose by 500 to 600 yuan to around 1,000 yuan.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market continued to see strong buying interest as Guangdong and Hubei trading houses continued to seek and purchase goods for transport south, and those holding goods held up prices. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth initially opened flat, but with active local buyers, prices rose as high as 400 yuan at one point. However, at the close, the price fell back to 390 yuan due to the allocation of Fangjian cloth. A certain dye factory, due to slow sales of colored cloth in various regions, sold off Longtou white cloth. The price fell back to 390 yuan, a gain of 20 yuan from the previous day.

Sijunzi gabardine, due to renewed searches by Hubei trading houses, rose to 400 yuan, a gain of 25 yuan. Other cloths saw firm trading as trading houses from Sichuan, Guangdong, Hubei, and other regions all made purchases.

Further News: Although the Yarn and Cloth Association once again submitted a request to the Social Bureau for permission to resume business, it has not yet received any orders from the Social Bureau. Officials from the two industries believe that it is difficult for the thousand or so brokers to maintain their livelihoods, and that further delays in resuming business will greatly affect operations. It has now been decided to resume business on a trial basis tomorrow, regardless of whether an order from the Social Bureau is received. The association has completed all preparations for reopening.

### Chung Hsing Textile Distribution

Chung Hsing Textile distributed 10,100 bolts of cloth yesterday, as well as 6,250 pounds of remnant cloth, totaling 3,910,750 yuan. In addition, the Chung Hsing Textile retail department has been entrusted by the Shanghai Operating Office of the Copper and Iron Enterprise Committee of the Assets Committee to sell a batch of dark-colored cloths such as Shilin twill khaki.

### Serious Outflow of Capital to the South, 5 Million Yuan Daily

The outflow of capital to the south from Shanghai is becoming increasingly serious. According to estimates from financial circles, the recent daily outflow of capital to the south has reached more than 5 million yuan. Among these, state-owned banks and bureaus have stricter restrictions, so the outflow is smaller, while the outflow from private banks and firms is larger, and even greater from foreign banks. This fact deserves attention and may lead to adverse consequences.

### Silver and Money Industry Association Reduces Exchange Guarantee Deposits for Banks and Firms

The Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Association, in order to reduce the exchange guarantee deposits for member banks, yesterday issued a notice to all banks, stating that member banks and firms with total deposits of less than 50,000 yuan may pay half of the stipulated 10,000 yuan.

### Companies and Businesses Concurrently Operating Banking Business: Will Be Ordered to Cease Operations If Discovered; Ministries of Finance and Industry Negotiate Penalty Standards

[Report from this Newspaper] The National Bank Auditing Office recently sent a circular to all branches, stating that it has received an electric message from the Ministry of Finance regarding the penalty standards for ordinary companies and businesses concurrently operating banking business, which have been negotiated with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The original electric message from the Ministry of Finance is reproduced below:

"Regarding the penalty standards for ordinary companies and businesses privately concurrently operating banking business, as approved by the Ministry of Finance on November 22nd, Finance Currency Geng No. 270 electric message, previously negotiated with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, branches should comply and report to your bank for reference. Furthermore, it has been found that some of the companies and businesses subject to such cases have not registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce or local competent authorities. Whether these can be directly penalized according to the penalty standards without consultation and verification has been inquired. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has replied, stating that according to the current company regulations, a company cannot be established until it has registered with the central competent authority. Furthermore, businesses should also apply to the local competent authority for approval and registration before they can be established. The Executive Yuan has previously approved and ordered compliance. Regarding the penalty for companies and businesses found to be concurrently operating banking business, in addition to companies and businesses that have already registered, the original regulations and procedures should still be followed. For companies and businesses that have not completed registration, if they are found to be concurrently operating banking business, regardless of their business type, this Ministry can agree that after your Ministry reports the matter, it can directly order the local competent authority to order the entire business to cease operations. This Ministry should also be notified so that the company can be penalized according to the Company Law for failing to register. As for businesses that fail to register, when your Ministry issues the order to cease operations, the local competent authority should be notified to carry out the penalty according to the regulations. In the future, this should be handled accordingly. In addition to branches, please inform all districts in charge of inspection to take note."

### Commercial Banks Adjust Capital; Ministry of Finance Explains Index Issues

[Report from this Newspaper] For commercial banks adjusting their capital, the portion of asset appreciation purchased after 1937, the national wholesale price index for June 1937 in the original calculation formula should be recalculated to the first half of August 1937, in accordance with the provisions of Item 4(c) of the Supplementary Measures for Fiscal Reorganization.

As for the "national wholesale price index for the year of purchase" in the calculation formula, whether it refers to the total index for the year of purchase or the index for the month of purchase, and the standard for calculating the price index for the first half of August 1937, the Ministry of Finance explained: "According to the national wholesale price index compiled by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, the first half of August 1937 was 445,960.000. In Article 6, Paragraph 3(b) of the "Measures for Commercial Banks to Adjust Capital," the "national wholesale price index for the year of purchase or construction" in the calculation formula is based on the index for the month of purchase or construction."

### Raw Silk Trading Stalled

The raw silk market initially showed promise, but stalled near noon. Superior grade zero-lot futures were priced at 10,500 yuan, and D grade at 11,000 yuan. Foreign trading houses offered prices for exports that were 15 cents lower per grade than before, so manufacturers were unwilling to sell at discounted prices, resulting in no transactions. Other grades, while lacking transactions, saw improved sentiment compared to the previous two days and were more active and lively.

Rayon initially remained weak. Tianqiao spot was priced at 9,300 yuan, rising to 9,500 yuan near noon, and Dongyang was priced at 9,700 yuan, on par with the previous afternoon's close. Yihuo Xishi Siniya remained at 9,300 yuan, with an arbitrage of 350 yuan.

Chouban Huaqiang bedding initially opened at 6,500 yuan, rising to 6,700 yuan at noon, up 200 yuan from yesterday's market. Biyue and Dawei neither had better than the other, and the rest lacked fluctuations, with few transactions.

With supply not meeting demand, the market price rose sharply, only stopping at 36 yuan. The afternoon market was slightly weak, closing at 35.5 yuan, breaking all previous records. The posted price for overseas remittances yesterday remained at 36 yuan.

Market Price Overview

### Machinery Goes to the Countryside: Jiangxi's Agricultural Reclamation Business Moves Forward

— Our Reporter Liu Zao

[Nanchang, February 2nd Express News] Jiangxi is a part of the Poyang Plain and has always been known as the "Granary of Jiangnan." However, in the past ten years or so, it has suffered from banditry and enemy disasters. The once prosperous and constantly cultivated farmland now presents a desolate scene. According to a preliminary survey by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, there are more than 200,000 mu of reclaimed fallow land, accounting for almost one-third of the province's arable area. Although the provincial government has also been continuously supporting spring plowing and encouraging winter planting, due to manpower, fertilizer, and the poor rural economy, the figures for wasteland reclamation and increased production have been minimal over the years.

Mechanical agricultural reclamation is giving Jiangxi's barren rural areas a new force. They use very little manpower to obtain more harvests, pulling the declining rural areas onto the road of revival and increased production. Currently, the Jiangxi Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Office is widely launching agricultural reclamation demonstration work and contract farming.

In the current stage of China's rural areas, everything is cultivated entirely by manpower and animal power. In order to promote mechanical cultivation and enable farmers to advance from the use of manpower and animal power to the use of machinery, the Agricultural Reclamation Office has adopted a stronghold approach to running Nanchang, De'an, Ruichang, and Shanggao.

Demonstration Farms

They use the wasteland all over the fields, use machinery to cultivate, so that the local people can recognize the effectiveness of machinery, and then use contract farming methods to engage in their own cultivation.

Shanggao Sixi Farm was the earliest place for mechanical cultivation in Jiangxi, and it began in October 1947. De'an, Nanchang, Ruichang and other farms, as well as the mechanical agricultural reclamation business in sixteen counties and cities throughout the province, were successively organized by the Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Office at the end of last year. At present, the area of wasteland reclaimed by their demonstration farms has reached 4,000 mu. Together with the past voluntary contract farming and the joint farm of the Dengjiabu Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the accumulated reclaimed wasteland is about 100,000 mu. However, the heavy rains during the spring and summer seasons this year affected the cultivation. The crops that had already been planted or were growing were mostly submerged by water or washed away. Therefore, the Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Office estimates that the summer harvest will suffer losses of 200 石 of sesame, 70 石 of melon seeds, 20 dan of cotton, and 40 石 of sorghum. A total of 434 mu of crops were submerged, resulting in a loss of over 8,400 yuan in production value. Currently, the staff of the demonstration farm have fully launched the

Winter Planting Campaign

They do not avoid difficulties or fear hardships in this new endeavor. Everyone is moving towards the overall goal of the business's success. This time, they planted 3,000 mu of wheat, 300 mu of oilseed rape, and 400 mu of broad beans. It is expected that in the first half of next year, they will harvest 4,500 石 of wheat, 200 石 of oilseed rape, and 200 石 of broad beans. The production income is estimated at 55,000 yuan at current market prices. The summer production volume next year is also expected to be above 50,000 yuan.

Contract farming and water pumping work have established work stations in Nanchang, De'an, and Ruichang, which are jointly managed by the demonstration farms in each location. Because they charge low fees, the local people all know to use mechanical contract farming, such as wasteland reclamation, sowing, harvesting, and even water pumping. Many drylands that were not originally intended to be cultivated have achieved yields one or two times higher than rice paddies this year due to the assistance of the Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Office's pumping stations. The people consider this an unexpected harvest, which further aroused their interest in using new machinery. Therefore, requests for

Contract Farming and Water Pumping Are Coming One After Another. The Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Office estimates that the area of contract farming in the first half of this year was 2075.6 mu, the area of contract harrowing was 8.29 mu, the drainage time was 5465 hours, and the irrigation area was 1437.9 mu.

Now, the Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Office plans to further expand from demonstration cultivation to "machinery going to the countryside" so that farmers in all areas can use new machinery for cultivation. Therefore, in addition to their "demonstration" and "contract farming" businesses, they are also promoting the distribution of agricultural machinery. According to Director Lin Fengchun, since the use of tractors and pumps, this business of distributing agricultural machinery has had a demonstration effect in Jiangxi, attracting the attention of the general farmers. Some farmers also want to purchase machinery, but

The Distribution Work Still Has Few Achievements. The reasons are: (1) the rural economy is declining, (2) farmers lack organization and are mostly small farmers. With the existing farmland system, the use of agricultural machinery is limited by terrain and management system.

Therefore, the Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Office is now working on improving the mechanical planting methods in rural areas. On the one hand, it is expanding the existing demonstration farms, and at the same time, it is implementing installment payment methods to give farmers in a declining economy the opportunity to purchase agricultural machinery, and also accepts applications from farmers to provide opportunities to learn mechanical cultivation.

Although mechanical agricultural reclamation in Jiangxi has been in operation for less than a year, it has achieved considerable success through their hard work. We can see that the records in the "Sprouts" magazine on China's agricultural mechanization and the report of the previous inspection tour to Jiangxi by the Mechanical Agricultural Reclamation Management Office both recognize that the Jiangxi Office's business, such as demonstration farms, contract farming, supply, and processing, have all been done well, which is clear evidence.

### Around the Time of the Fall of Shenyang: Surviving the Jaws of Death, Witnessing the Tragedy, Providing a Serious Lesson (Part 2)

On the 29th, dense gunfire and artillery fire could be heard in the eastern and northern suburbs of Shenyang. On the morning of the 30th, it finally quieted down slightly. The reason for the silence was that the "front office" had already "written the article," meaning that the surrender had already begun. On the afternoons of the 29th and 30th, Wei Lihuang summoned Gao Xibing, Peng Jiqun, Wang Jiazhen of the Northeast Political Affairs Committee, Wang Tiehan, chairman of Liaoning Province, and Dong Wenqi, mayor of Shenyang, to a meeting. Chief of Staff Zhao Jiaxiang reported on the current situation. At the same time, news of the instability of the defending troops was constantly transmitted to this round-table conference. Everyone agreed that the overall situation was lost. Only then did several civil officials fully understand the gravity of the situation.

Initially, the President sent a telegram ordering the resolute defense of Shenyang. During the meeting, Wei Lihuang and others received another telegram from the President, ordering them to lead senior civil and military officials to evacuate immediately. At 3 p.m., Wei only accompanied Zhao Jiaxiang, Gao Xibing, Wang Jiazhen, Wang Tiehan, Dong Wenqi, Peng Jiqun, and a few others, as well as Pan Yukun, commander of the New 1st Army, Wei Long Tianwu, and Wu Li, deputy commander of the Shenyang Air Force, who arrived later. In addition, there were Xu Liang, commander of the cavalry and chairman of Liaobei Province, and Hu Jiaji, commander of the Shenyang Garrison, who arrived later.

At the moment of boarding the plane, the scene was too tense and too tragic, because many officers and soldiers who had retreated from the front line were crowding in front of the plane, scrambling to board. The front row pushed against the back row, and the scene was a mess. Wei Lihuang climbed onto the plane, and Zhao Jiaxiang also boarded. Wang Jiazhen was passed in over the heads of the crowd. Dong Wenqi was pulled up from the side. Others, like Wang Tiehan, also got on. Zhang Jianfei, the Northeast Special Envoy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, pulled Mayor Dong's hand to get on board. Committee member Peng Jiqun was squeezed out of the plane and could not get on. As the plane took off, the ground was a scene of

yelling and shouting. This was the last plane to take off from Dongling.

What about Hunhe Airport? On the afternoon of the 30th, there were four planes parked there, said to be on a special mission. Outside the airport, there were civil servants who had purchased tickets two days before but were unable to fly. Then came batches of military personnel running over, covered in sweat, totaling about a hundred people.

Soon, all four planes, under the guise of "test flights," started their engines and took off empty, one after another. At that time, the people at the airport were disappointed and indignant, but who cared!

The reporter witnessed Ms. Zhu Lun, an executive of the Northeastern District Women's Association of the Central Party Headquarters, grabbing the jeep of an air force deputy commander, crying bitterly. She pointed to a young man standing beside her and said, "As his aunt, if I don't take Zheng Dongguo's young master away, I'll really feel sorry. You're all leaving, please think of a way for me!" The response was, "The situation has improved now. If we leave, we'll be letting the country down." After saying that, the jeep sped off to Dongta Airport, where it was said to have flown away with Wei Lihuang.

Ms. Zhu Lun was left behind at the airport and could not leave. A woman chewing gum, requesting a ride, kept saying, "I am the wife of Deputy Commander-in-Chief Chen." But she also received no help. When the reporter left the airport in the evening, he still saw batches of military personnel rushing to the airport, hoping to escape the dangerous situation, but all their efforts were in vain.

On the 30th, in the afternoon and evening, the area around Shenyang was unusually quiet. Zhao Yi (Xijian), the Northeast District Director of the Ministry of National Defense Military Law, and Wang Huayi (who failed to board a plane while waiting in line at Dongta) who reluctantly came forward as a local figure, Lu Naigeng, the person in charge of the Chamber of Commerce, Xu Yangyang of the New 1st Army, and others, angered and disappointed, negotiated with the Communist side in a shop. It was heard that the main purpose of the negotiation was to spare the citizens of Shenyang from suffering, requesting the "Eighth Route Army" to postpone its entry and not to make Shenyang a battlefield.

On the 31st, there were no major changes in the suburbs, and the streets were extremely quiet. Only the military and civilians moving their homes back and forth showed some chaos, as if telling people that the situation was about to change drastically. At night, the stars filled the sky, and the earth was silent.

Before dawn on November 1st, a loud explosion was heard in the Tiexi District, followed by constant artillery and gunfire. The citizens were startled, thinking that the "peace talks" had broken down. Later, they learned that it was an ammunition depot that had exploded.

In the morning, planes disappeared from the sky. Chaotic gunfire was heard everywhere in the city. Soldiers with red silk strips on their upper pocket appeared on the streets, engaged in security. Many disintegrated officers and soldiers, carrying clothes, biscuits, and flour, were running around everywhere.

At noon, the gunfire subsided. Scattered bandits in ragged clothes, with hand grenades stuck in their waists and carrying large iron bars, appeared in the urban area. The disintegrated National Army soldiers were looking at these exhausted bandits in groups here and there. Later, teams of bandits arrived, wearing grass wreaths on their hats, stuck with messy grass. Soon, jeeps and trucks were speeding on the streets, confiscating firearms and weapons everywhere. Then,

the Korean Communists came and also entered the urban area, confiscating weapons and engaged in security. The "peace talks" ended without result. Zhao Yi and others went to Tieling on the afternoon of the 30th to negotiate with the bandits, but did not return. Zhou Fucheng, commander of the 53rd Army, Su Bingwen, chief consultant of the Northeast Suppression General Headquarters, and other personnel had already been placed under house arrest. In the meantime, some officers and soldiers of the 207th Division resisted and tried to break through, but unfortunately, it was all in vain.

In the evening, the air force flew from Beiping to Shenyang and dropped the first bomb. At night, every thirty to forty minutes, planes flew in to bomb, and flares lit up the city sky, continuing throughout the night. The bombing area was widespread.

On the 2nd, some poor people distributed the stored grain from several grain areas and demolished several houses. In the afternoon, the air force came again to bomb the Tiexi factories and the Dongguan arsenal. On the 3rd and 4th, they continued to bomb for two more days. At night, they sometimes flew in, and several ammunition depots were hit, constantly making explosions. Probably on the 7th, the bandits transported in anti-aircraft guns and began to fire at the air, but the bombing did not stop.

On the 3rd, the bandits established a "Military Control Committee" with Chen Yun, Wu Xiuquan, Tao Zhu, Zhang Xuesi, Wang Shoudao, Chen Bu, Zhu Qiwen, Chen Long and other eight people as members. Chen Yun served as the chairman, and Wu and Tao as the deputies. It was divided into four departments: finance, economy, logistics, and railways.

The Shenyang Garrison Command was changed to the "Garrison Headquarters," with Wu Xiuquan and Tao Zhu serving as the commander and deputy commander, respectively. Zhang Xuesi, chairman of the bandit Liaoning Province, arrived in Shenyang on the 5th to take office. Zhu Qiwen was the puppet mayor of Shenyang, with Jiao Ruoyu as the deputy mayor, Jia Shi as the puppet director of the Finance Bureau, Liu Xiangsan as the puppet director of the Industry Bureau, Zhu Jingzhi as the puppet director of the Commerce Bureau, Gan Chongdou as the puppet director of the Social Bureau, Wang Shiqing as the puppet director of the General Affairs Bureau, Jiang Feng as the puppet director of the Health Bureau, Shao Kai as the puppet director of the Education Bureau, He Xia as the puppet director of the Public Security Bureau, and Zhang Yunlong as the puppet director of the People's Court. All of them took their puppet positions.

The bandits were caught off guard by the occupation of Shenyang, so their political personnel arrived five or six days later than the troops. Formal activities began on November 10th. The district governments in the city were established on the 10th, and the

census began on the 15th. Meetings were held for the citizens every day, which annoyed them.

annoyed them.

Economically, the people suffered the most. First, it was stipulated that the gold yuan and circulating coupons should be stopped completely. Later, it was stipulated that they could be exchanged at a certain rate for ten days upon request.

At first, everyone sold things, exchanged money, and bought things. The grain carts from Kaiyuan and Siping came, and the price of sorghum did indeed drop, but the source of other goods and daily necessities disappeared, and the prices rose across the board, so life became more difficult.

The Communist Party's "Trade Bureau" was absorbing clothes and daily necessities. The people took things to exchange for grain and soybean oil. The "Trade Bureau" was making a lot of profit. The "Trade Bureau" was distributed in various districts, doing all possible business, purchasing, and transportation. There were large institutions everywhere, and large stores would be squeezed out. Large enterprises and businesses would be monopolized by the "Trade Bureau."

People with carts and horses mostly organized "production carts" to pull passengers and transport goods, enjoying protection and eating public grain. The profits were split in half. The bandits originally had no train or car transportation, and the production carts helped greatly. Although the transportation situation has changed greatly, such production rubber-wheeled carts are still running on various highways and stations.

The Northeast affair was handled so badly, and the losses were so terrible. Everyone is responsible, especially from the time of the takeover to this disastrous defeat. We should settle the old scores and find out the truth. This is a major settlement and a major lesson. If we shy away from treatment for fear of the disease, is there any way out?

### Communism in China (5)

The competition between the Nationalists and Communists for control of the Northeast, which began shortly after Japan's surrender, eventually evolved into open civil war. By the second half of 1946, the Communist Party had gradually gained confidence in its own strength, while also increasingly believing that the United States would cease supporting the Nationalist Party, at least temporarily. In the Communist areas, the Communist propaganda's fundamental attitude had a strong anti-American bias from the beginning. On June 20, 1946, this propaganda policy was extended to non-Communist areas. This day can be considered the day the second civil war extended from the Northeast to mainland China. On that day, the Soviet radio station and Chinese newspapers in Shanghai launched an anti-American propaganda campaign. This event immediately followed the Communist Party's military offensive in Shandong. For the first time, the Executive Headquarters, which had been cooperating between the Nationalists and Communists, experienced an open rift in parts of China outside the Northeast. Following this, Mao Zedong openly demanded that the United States cease all aid to the Nationalist government and withdraw its troops stationed in China.

Following the start of the propaganda campaign in Shanghai newspapers, on June 23, the same day Mao Zedong issued his statement, processions and demonstrations followed, with an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 participants. This unrest developed into the "U.S. Troops Get Out of China Week" movement, which took place in the last week of June.

The propaganda policy at this time aimed to emphasize that the Communist Party desired peace, while the United States did not, and Marshall's efforts were disregarded. Propagandists claimed that the mission of American troops stationed in China, such as repatriating Japanese soldiers, had long been completed, and there was no need to remain in China any longer.

Propagandists went further, denouncing the United States as an aggressor nation in Asia and the successor to Japanese imperialism, calling upon government troops to unite and resist the United States with the same spirit as they had resisted Japan in the past. Popular propaganda stated that American imperialism was more cunning and formal than Japanese imperialism, because the United States was more powerful than Japan, making American imperialism even more dangerous and frightening.

The Communist Party's propaganda consisted of a set of stale anti-American arguments: the United States selling surplus goods was called imperialistic; American imports were seen as competing with domestic products; the U.S. discussing civil aviation agreements was considered a prelude to controlling air transport rights; traffic accidents caused by Americans indicated the carelessness of American soldiers, and the failure to prosecute these cases according to the law indicated the Nationalist government's slavish attitude towards foreigners. Of course, any American news that could be exploited was exaggerated and sensationalized, including reports and rumors of American strikes, and the remarks of American politicians who were dissatisfied with the Nationalist government. Although the lynching of black people had been largely abolished at that time, it was still emphasized in propaganda. Newspapers in the areas occupied by the Nationalist government also seized upon the major theme of Communist anti-American propaganda and promoted it heavily. Cartoons published in "liberal" newspapers depicted "Uncle Sam" as a puppeteer, or taking advantage of the chaos, or hoarding goods for profit in the Chinese market, or seeking imperialist interests through commercial treaties.

This is the true face of the Communist Party's propaganda in China; its mission is not to convert the populace to Communism—that is the mission of the Red Army. The purpose of propaganda is only to confuse people and weaken the will and confidence of the people in non-Communist areas.

As for turning any part of non-Communist areas into part of Communist areas, that is a military task, supported by the techniques of economic and political warfare. Some call this tactic sociological warfare because it integrates economics, psychology, politics, finance, and other factors into one.

After the Communist Party occupies an area, it usually establishes a temporary military organization, mobilizing the local lower classes to rob the homes of residents and wealthy people who have already fled. They also set up a "People's Court" to try anyone suspected of causing trouble. They implement forced conscription. They issue new currency, recall the currency issued by the Nationalist government, and use exchange rates to destroy the people's savings, eliminating classes of rich and poor.

The propaganda methods used in the past to oppose Japan's support of Chinese puppet governments and warlords are now being used against the United States' support of the Nationalist government, which has become a puppet of the United States.

Another aspect of the propaganda shows that the Chinese people are peace-loving, and the CCP is also peace-loving. If it were not for the American conspiracy to support its puppet Chiang Kai-shek, there would be no civil war. All peace-loving Chinese people should unite to support the peace-loving Chinese Communist Party.

The Chinese people have not forgotten the Nationalist government's contributions to the war against Japan, and their attitude towards the Nationalist government would not have changed suddenly, but their belief was diminished by the condemnation of the United States. At that time, Chiang was only attacked as a puppet and dupe of American policy. The Chinese people were very clear in their minds: it was the Communist Party, not the Nationalist government, that broke the truce agreement and restarted the civil war. Blaming the outbreak of the civil war on an American conspiracy made it seem reasonable that the Communist Party was not the real instigator of the war.

Due to the fact that many Chinese people had some contact with Americans, and most Americans had a good impression, the Communist propagandists did not encounter much difficulty. They divided Americans into two categories: one category was the friendly Americans and American leftists, and the other category was everyone else. These second category Americans were all classified as fascist imperialists.

People's Courts vary according to local conditions, but generally lack legal regulations or evidence, relying on mob rule to accuse people of any crime, and arbitrarily pronounce sentences. The Communist Party's trials and death sentences of foreign Christian missionaries proved the Communist Party's contempt for religion.

Between 1945 and 1946, incidents of Communist Party interference in church activities occurred one after another, including robbery, fines, shootings, public executions, as well as arrests and disappearances. UNRRA service personnel were often stopped, sniped at, or placed under police surveillance. At the same time, Communist propaganda demanded that UNRRA increase its aid to Communist areas, and UNRRA medicines were continuously transported to Communist military hospitals.

All these tactics completely destroyed the economic system. But this does not hinder Communism, because the Communist Party does not need to provide for cities it does not occupy, nor does it need to seek markets in the "enemy" areas beyond its borders. But it does weaken the Nationalist government's strength everywhere. Before seizing all political power, the Communist Party was willing to let the country collapse, and had various ways to promote this situation. In any area where its control is not yet stable, the Communist Party has no motivation to engage in economic construction.

The military aspect of Communism surpasses other factors in the Communist Party's organization, as can be seen in other areas and outside of China. The regular troops of the Chinese Red Army give observers the best impression. In the rapidly growing recent years, its discipline and morale have declined compared to the past, but the Red Army's administration in newly recovered areas is probably better than later civil administration facilities. Its senior officers are mostly capable and have many years of guerrilla warfare experience. Its junior officers are mediocre, and the soldiers are mostly ordinary conscripts, no different from the soldiers of any Chinese army in the past. Its policy of avoiding combat is really most suitable for the tastes of undisciplined elements who only want to loot.

The CCP's organization emphasized the scenario of civil war activities. The CCP's highest governing body is the Central Executive Committee, composed of 44 members and 33 alternate members. Among the executive committee members, 12 are soldiers, and among the alternate members, at least 5 are soldiers. The Central Executive Committee is usually run by two smaller groups—the Political Bureau and the Military Commission—to carry out party affairs. The Political Bureau, composed of eight members, is the CCP's real executive committee, and the Military Commission is composed of six members. Four people serve as members of both groups, and Mao Zedong serves as chairman of both the Bureau and the Commission. Therefore, the basic division of the highest organ of the Communist government is between military and civilian affairs, with close cooperation between the two, only the authority of the civil officials is slightly higher.

The administrative departments of the Communist Party's central government are directly under the Central Executive Committee, and are responsible for propaganda, education, economy, finance, and other functions. The CCP's administration is more decentralized than centralized. In lower-level administrative organs, the division of military and civil authority is extremely even, almost entirely depending on individual circumstances. An army commander can be the head of a locality, and a political commissar can also be the head of another locality, all depending on their courage, ambition, and personal talent.

To summarize the actions of the Chinese Communist Party after the Japanese surrender, we may as well reiterate the situation during the American-led peace talks. The CCP broke the January 10 truce agreement and began advancing into the Northeast in early spring, and advanced into Shandong in July. They besieged Yongnian, Hebei, for a year. At the end of this year, Communist commander Zhu De exaggerated that they had annihilated 45 brigades of Nationalist troops. The Nationalist government's reports stated that when the truce began, the Communist army only controlled 60 counties, but by the end of the truce, it had expanded to 300 counties. During this period, it is said that the two sides continuously held formal negotiations in order to establish a truce agreement and achieve a comprehensive solution.

C. The Changing Direction of World Communism

Since the end of the wars against Germany and Japan, world communism has begun to change direction. This is another major shift in Communist Party policy that is consistent with Leninist doctrine. Since the first major shift in 1921 from the policy of war communism to the so-called New Economic Policy, this is the sixth shift. Obviously, we must consider this shift in world communist strategy.

In his writings, Mao Zedong believed that the situation in China must be viewed in many ways in relation to the world situation. The development of the situation in China after the Russian Revolution was not the same as before. In 1930 and during the war, China's political problems were echoing the situation in Europe and other parts of the world. This is not only Mao Zedong's view, but also the standard view of the general Communist Party.

Therefore, we may as well assume that the major changes in the world situation over the past three years must be reflected in the changing direction of Chinese communism, although the new direction has not yet been fully clarified. The "New Democracy" policy applied to China is, after all, the same period as the cooperation of the wartime allies, and it is also an extension of the "People's Front" doctrine that originated in Europe in 1936. "New Democracy" was adopted by several countries in Eastern Europe between 1945 and 1946. They established governments that allowed the Communist Party to occupy important positions in the cabinet, and used these governments to maintain their unshakable advantage. In this way, the future goal of "New Democracy" immediately became the current reality, canceling all pretexts for democratic style and coordination between parties, and transforming the question of how to seize power into the question of how to use it after seizing power. This change, simply put, is that the Communist Party's gaining power in several countries has become an important point in the world trend of transitioning from the compromise and cooperation between wartime communism and democratic countries to the "Cold War."

The basic mode of operation of the Communist Party after seizing power is most clearly demonstrated in the history of the Soviet Union itself. The major problems encountered by the Communist Party after gaining power in an industrially backward country are as follows:

1. The speed of industrial development necessary to expand the potential for war in future international struggles.

2. The speed of capital accumulation necessary for this industrial development.

3. The speed of agricultural collectivization necessary to reduce agricultural labor and expand industrial labor.

4. Determining the most appropriate timing for the transition from decentralization of the United Front to the exclusive power of the Communist Party.

5. Determining the most appropriate timing for the gradual decline of Communism from overemphasizing patriotic sentiments.

6. Determining the most appropriate timing for the Communist Party to carry out purges and restore a strong united front party to replace the scattered parties of "New Democracy."

7. The division of various classes and parties other than the Communist Party.

8. Determining the most appropriate timing for incorporating new Communist areas into Soviet territory.

The problem of communism in the past three years can be said to be the re-departure of communism to cope with the above-mentioned problems. But even if these problems are handled as urgent tasks, the "New Democracy" strategy cannot be applied again. Therefore, this re-departure of communism requires changing organizations, readjusting the connections between other groups, changing some Communist Party leaders, and changing policies and strategies.

Since the efforts to try to form a coalition cabinet that accommodated the Communist Party failed, the opportunity for "New Democracy" to be applied to China ended. But the Chinese Communist Party can endure this change. Since 1944, the CCP's strength has gradually increased. It adopted a new policy and did not encounter any serious problems, because the Chinese civil war was in full swing and had not yet reached a decisive stage. If the CCP wins the Chinese civil war, it will inevitably cause the most serious internal policy problems for the Communist Party in Eastern Europe, as well as the question of China's mission to promote communism in Asia. But the CCP will be able to find ways to deal with these problems when they arise.

D. The Debate in the United States on the China Problem

For the United States, the China problem is a problem of assistance. Since the Japanese surrender, the United States has had extensive discussions on this issue. The problem is certainly difficult to solve. Just looking at the protracted debate and the inability to reach a satisfactory conclusion, one can imagine how thorny this problem is. When the Foreign Affairs Committee met in February and March of this year to discuss the Foreign Aid Act of 1948, the reasons held by the proponents and opponents were stated in detail. The summary is as follows:

Those who advocate that the United States should not aid China before China has laid the foundation for domestic unity and peace hold the following reasons:

1. If peace can be achieved, international war and large-scale civil war can certainly be avoided.

2. If peace can be achieved, all parties and factions in China can certainly unite and cooperate to lay the foundation for a democratic republic.

3. Whatever aid the United States gives to China, the Soviet Union will certainly take relative actions, and the two sides will enter into competitive intervention.

4. Outsider countries should not interfere in China's civil war.

5. If outsider countries interfere in the civil war, they are infringing upon the right of the people to self-determination.

6. The Nationalist government organization is not sound and is corrupt. If the United States gives it aid, this aid will certainly be wasted.

7. In the past few years, the United States and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration have given China a lot of aid, which has not had any effect.

8. If we give China sufficient aid, it will eventually become a large and difficult to handle permanent burden for us.

9. Chinese communism is an economic reform movement that is sound and powerful.

10. "New Democracy" is a liberal and democratic program.

11. Questions about the importance of Chinese independence to U.S. security must not be included in the United Nations' world peace plan.

12. China's territory is too large, and aid is unlikely to be effective.

13. To maintain the goodwill of the Chinese people for a long time, only a non-intervention policy can be adopted. If we interfere in China's affairs, even if we do not have to bear the responsibility for the civil war, we will have to bear the responsibility for prolonging the war in the minds of the Chinese people.

As for those who advocate that the United States should aid China, they hold the following reasons:

1. Communism is not simply economic reform, but also a power politics with an unprecedented level of expertise.

2. If one country does not interfere in the civil war on the one hand but interferes in the civil war on the other, it still cannot preserve the country's right to self-determination.

3. The Soviet Union skillfully and on a large scale interfered in China's civil war.

4. China has suffered from more than 20 years of civil war and international war, and the Chinese organization behind the Nationalist government is fragile and corrupt. (To be continued)
