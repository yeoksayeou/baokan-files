Although a portion of the bandits broke into the commercial district, fierce street fighting has been raging since last night until this afternoon. The fighting has subsided slightly this afternoon, but some strongholds are still under the control of the National Army. Fighting has broken out at the Puli Gate in the west of the old city.

[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou on the 23rd] Liu Zhi and Wang Shuming flew over Jinan at 11:00 AM on the 23rd to oversee the battle and spoke with Commander Wang Yaowu. The Air Force Huanghai aircraft group flew over Jinan today to assist in the battle, completely destroying the bandit military strongholds along the Yonggu Gate and Yongjing Gate city walls. The bandits who entered the southwest corner of the city were also completely strafed and annihilated, with over 2,000 bandits killed or wounded. Four bandit locomotives were destroyed in bombing raids in Yanzhou, and over 100 bandits were killed outside the north gate of Teng County.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 23rd] Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi, accompanied by Air Force Deputy Commander Wang Shuming, flew over the battlefield at 11:00 AM on the 23rd to direct the land and air forces in combat. Both witnessed the National Army bravely fighting the bandits while defending the Jinan ring city defense line and the strongholds on Qianfo Mountain, Ma'an Mountain, and Sili Mountain. They also observed that the order within the city was very good, indicating that the citizens were also extremely calm. Commander-in-Chief Liu communicated with Wang Yaowu, the concurrent Commander in the city, via wireless telephone from the aircraft. According to reports, the National Army in Jinan has killed or wounded over 20,000 bandits in recent days. Although the National Army has suffered casualties, morale remains high, and officers and soldiers are determined to defend to the end and have means to repel the invading bandits. Commander-in-Chief Liu was very gratified to learn of this situation and offered much encouragement, expressing his strong belief that they will be able to accomplish their mission.

Defense Ministry spokesman Deng Wenyi confirmed the above situation at a press conference on the 23rd. Foreign reporters in attendance paid close attention to the Jinan battle situation, asking many questions. In response to inquiries, Deng pointed out that the Yellow River Railway Bridge north of Jinan City has been occupied by bandits, but the Qilu University, Qianfo Mountain, Ma'an Mountain, and other locations south of the city are firmly defended by the National Army, preventing the bandits from attacking the city directly from the north. On the 20th of this month, a bandit regiment that infiltrated the commercial district was annihilated by our forces. The bandits who have successively invaded since then number more than one column.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 23rd] Bandit troops on the outskirts of Jinan City have launched another full-scale attack today.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing on the 23rd] Director of the Executive Yuan Information Bureau Dong Xian Guang answered inquiries at a press conference on the 23rd as follows:

Question: It is mentioned in the secret record of Hopkins published in the Collier's magazine on August 28 that President Roosevelt had already discussed the handling of the Dalian issue with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek at the Cairo Conference long before the Yalta Conference was held. The Shanghai Great America Evening News wrote an editorial about this. What is Director Dong's opinion?

Answer: I also happened to be present and participated in the Cairo talks mentioned by Hopkins at that time. As far as I know, President Roosevelt once spoke with President Chiang and asked about the possibility of changing Dalian into a free port after the end of the war. At that time, President Chiang replied: Without hindering China's sovereignty, it may be considered when the time is appropriate.

(2) All administrative agencies and public enterprises should, except for technical personnel who should be given preferential treatment, adjust their salaries in accordance with the principle of equal pay for equal work and equal pay for the same location, unify standards, and must not set their own salaries, arbitrarily increase the number of salaries issued, create names, and misappropriate funds. All points must be returned to the public and enrich the national treasury. (3) Change the treatment of civil servants in accordance with the current price situation and daily life needs to maintain their basic life and encourage honest governance. (4) Strictly implement the standards for the appointment of civil servants, earnestly assess rewards and punishments, effectively improve the quality of civil servants, and fully exert work efficiency.

### An Excellent Source for Establishing an Aluminum Industry: Iron Bauxite Deposits Discovered in Fujian, US Bureau of Mines Attaches Great Importance and Has Prepared a Report

[Report] Washington, 23rd Broadcast: According to a report by the U.S. Bureau of Mines, iron bauxite deposits recently discovered in Fujian Province in southeastern coastal China will provide China with an excellent source of raw materials needed to establish an aluminum industry. The Bureau made the above report based on a report prepared by Klingham, an economic analyst at the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai, after studying China's light metal industry. According to a report by the Resources Committee Bureau of Mines, the ore beds in Fujian Province contain 500,000 tons of aluminum-containing minerals. The US Bureau of Mines stated that China used to import bauxite from the Dutch East Indies and other places before the war to meet domestic needs, spending a lot of foreign exchange. In order to save this foreign exchange, it will inevitably find ways to supply bauxite domestically in order to achieve self-sufficiency. Zhejiang, Anhui, Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Yunnan, and other provinces in China all produce bauxite, but they have not yet been fully developed, and their reserves have not been estimated. At present, China's demand for aluminum is small, about 5,000 to 10,000 tons per year, but after all the factories destroyed during the war and operated by the Japanese have been restored, the demand for aluminum will greatly increase.

### Full Text of President Chiang’s Address at the Academia Sinica Convocation: Five Hopes for Academic Advancement

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] President Chiang addressed the Academia Sinica convocation today. The full text is as follows:

Today is the first gathering of the Academicians of Academia Sinica. This is fortunate for the Chinese academic community and for the nation.

Academia Sinica has been established for twenty years, but only this year has there been an election and assembly of Academicians. Its establishment was one of the important policies for national construction after the Northern Expedition when the national capital was set in Nanjing. The fact that the election of Academicians has only taken place after twenty years is genuinely due to the invasion by Japanese bandits. During the military period, it was not easy to attend to long-term plans for cultural and educational development. Also, the path of academic progress requires that each step wait for the maturity of the opportunity. If it is done before the opportunity is ripe, it is easy to create malpractices. Academia Sinica has been able to do this only after twenty years of experience, which is sufficient to demonstrate its gradual progress and its commitment to pragmatism. Examining the precedents of national academies in various countries, each selects Academicians or members as the main body, and then research work develops accordingly. Academia Sinica established research institutes twenty years ago and established a very comprehensive national council thirteen years ago. Today, the establishment of a national Academicians’ assembly seems to reverse the general order. This is precisely because at the beginning of Academia Sinica’s establishment, various Chinese academic fields were not as developed as they were ten years later, so the conditions for the regular election of Academicians were not in place. Although academic endeavors have been deeply affected by the Japanese bandits in the past ten years, some subjects are still on a steady path of progress. Therefore, today's ability to do this is precisely what is called "when water flows, a channel is formed." The founding of Academia Sinica began with this steady plan, which is truly the foresight of the former President Mr. Cai Yuanpei. The ability of Academia Sinica to attract talent and establish achievements is also due to Mr. Cai Yuanpei’s virtue and reputation.

The Academicians elected this year are truly outstanding talents of the nation. From now on, the nation will have its representative academy, cooperating and progressing with academies around the world. Given this good opportunity, I would like to express my hopes to you.

First, raise academic standards. Today, the number of universities in the country is far greater than before. This is indeed a need for national construction, but it is still a long way off for each to be able to fully perform the functions of education and achieve the task of academics. To seek academic advancement, it is necessary to first establish a model and create a reputation, and then, as the influence spreads, there will be widespread progress. Each of you has been recognized by the people of the country in your respective fields of study. In the future, you must further increase your discoveries and inventions in your specialized fields. Within ten years, it will not be difficult to catch up with the advanced scientific countries, as Sun Yat-sen said.

Second, disseminate academic achievements. I will not mention ancient Chinese matters. Although there were no modern academies in the Ming and Qing dynasties, the dissemination of their cultural relics was unmatched by any country in the world at that time. The Ming Dynasty had the compilation of the Yongle Encyclopedia, and the Qing Dynasty had the compilation of the Complete Collection of Books. The Ming Dynasty had the printing of books by the Jingchang, and the Qing Dynasty had the compilation of the Siku Quanshu. Today, the scope of academic research is far wider than before. Republican academics should strive to surpass the past, with grand compilations and masterpieces, both to enlighten the wisdom of the Chinese people and to promote the nation’s culture and education to the world.

Third, promote scientific cooperation. The progress of science is due to free development and rational planning. In the early stages of modern scientific development, the former was more important. Today, equipment and organization are necessary for work. Therefore, to seek substantial achievements, there must be rational planning. This is not the work of one person, nor is it the work of one school or one institution. It is necessary to concentrate efforts on one design, and then it can be expected to achieve success. To seek rational and effective planning, it is necessary to seek outstanding talents. To cooperate according to the plan, it is necessary to rely on the reputation of the academic community. This is indeed the responsibility of you all.

Fourth, communicate academically with academies of various countries. Now that China has this representative national academic body, cooperation with academies of various countries should be more convenient than in the past. All such cooperation, whether it is cooperation in undertakings or exchange of talents, can affect the domestic scientific community, thereby promoting academic progress, not only for the purpose of fostering good neighborly relations between countries.

Fifth, devote efforts to national construction. Modern national construction relies on academic progress in every aspect. Therefore, countries with backward academics are also backward countries. If a country seeks progress, academics must advance first. In today's society, everything related to clothing, food, housing, transportation, and childbirth and disease requires scientific knowledge to help improve it. In today's nation, whether it is agricultural promotion, industrial construction, or military installations, it also requires scientific knowledge to establish its foundation. There are countless construction projects in our country, all of which have a very distant future due to the backwardness of science. The needs of the era are even more pressing. Engaging in this is the business of the entire nation, but contributing your knowledge and leading the way is especially the responsibility of you all. Building a modern China is building a scientific China. This must be the sentiment that you share with me. I especially hope that you will all go to the cause of construction with one heart and cooperate to achieve it.

At this auspicious gathering, I have briefly discussed what I hope for, to wish this meeting success and to wish for the progress of Chinese academics. (Please refer to page 7 for news about the Academia Sinica Convocation)

Editorial

### Facing the Crisis in Southeast Asia

The Indonesian Communist Party launched a coup on the 19th, occupying Madiun City, the industrial center of East Java. The party leader, Muso, declared the establishment of the "Javanese Soviet Republic," appointing himself as the "President" of this red regime. From the Madiun radio station, he called on the Indonesian people to rise up and overthrow the Republican government led by President Sukarno. As a result, the Indonesian Republican government had no choice but to abandon the provisions of the new constitution, granting extraordinary dictatorial powers to President Sukarno in order to quell the violent rebellion of the Indonesian Communist Party. Therefore, the traces of blood from the Dutch-Indonesian War have not yet dried, and now it has reached the brink of civil war. This is not only a misfortune for the Indonesian people, but also a wake-up call for Southeast Asia. As the saying goes, "One falling leaf heralds the coming of autumn." The crisis in Southeast Asia cannot be ignored!

The crisis in Southeast Asia has been brewing for a long time. After the end of World War II, Southeast Asian countries, such as Indonesia, Burma, Vietnam, and Malaya, were all stirred by the world trend and longed for freedom and independence. The conflicts between the Dutch and Indonesians and the disputes between the French and Vietnamese all occurred in this context. However, for the past two or three years, they have failed to achieve thorough and reasonable solutions that could satisfy the wishes of the people of each country. In the face of disappointment, it is natural to easily take extreme paths. According to a United Press International dispatch from Singapore, British diplomat Coster said, "The rise of communism in Indonesia is entirely due to the deep disappointment of the Indonesian people with American policy." This statement can be described as a "bullseye," worthy of deep reflection by the great powers. In particular, the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands, which have direct interests in Southeast Asia, must change their current policies.

Looking at the actual situation in Southeast Asia, the riots of communist parties everywhere have become increasingly active since the establishment of the Southeast Asia branch of the Communist International Intelligence Bureau in Bangkok in May, due to central leadership. Now, it has reached a point where it is "out of control." Bangkok has become the main base for communist activities in Southeast Asia. Burma also has a tendency to turn left. Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu has openly declared that he "wishes to make the whole country Sovietized," which is truly shocking. As for India, the Communist Party has always possessed great potential among workers and peasants. In January of this year, it also encouraged railway workers in Calcutta to strike. Fortunately, Nehru's active suppression of communism was able to force the communist agitation underground. However, the situation in Malaya is more serious than anywhere else. The Communist Party is lurking in rubber plantations, agitating, assassinating, robbing, and arsoning everywhere, using every means possible, forcing British Commissioner for Malaya Sir Gurney to declare a state of emergency and arrest communist bandits on a large scale, causing the British Communist Party to say, "The colonial war has already begun in Malaya." Recently, the violent coup by the Indonesian Communist Party has shown an even stronger "rising tide."

The crisis in Southeast Asia has long been taken seriously by public opinion. For example, the Manchester Guardian in the United Kingdom commented on the Asian situation in June, arguing that "preventing the development of the Communist Party in Asia lies in providing economic assistance to Asian countries." American House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton also said in early July, "Asia and the Far East are more dangerous than European countries; the real expansion of the Soviet Union will target Asian countries." Congressman Judd further pointed out that "the Communist Party has launched a decisive offensive in Asia." However, British and American officials have remained silent. It was not until the 15th of this month that Foreign Secretary Bevin declared in the House of Commons, "The Communist International has launched an offensive to drive Western forces out, and the development of the situation in Southeast Asia has recently begun... They not only want to make Burma and Malaya fall entirely within the scope of communist occupation, but also to cause such disturbances and unrest in every corner of the world." At the same time, Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker, seeing the deepening crisis in Southeast Asia, went to Washington to discuss countermeasures with Marshall. Although the content is unknown, it can be asserted that an agreement must have been reached between the United States and the Netherlands. The gradual emphasis of the great powers on the crisis in Southeast Asia is also becoming increasingly clear.

In short, on the one hand, the power of the Communist Party is gradually pressing westward towards Western Europe. The inability to resolve the Berlin crisis has already shown the tension in the European situation. On the other hand, it is also launching an offensive in Southeast Asia, creating unrest and unease throughout Asia, attempting to take advantage of the illusion that the United Kingdom and the United States are neglecting the crisis in Southeast Asia to achieve its mission without any effort. If so, the result will not only be that the economic interests of Western democratic countries in Southeast Asia will be deeply affected, but also that they will suffer major blows in politics and military strategy. Therefore, after the violent coup by the Indonesian Communist Party, we must awaken the attention of countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Netherlands. The crisis in Southeast Asia is deepening, and we must not neglect the importance of Southeast Asia because of the Berlin crisis. However, the way to save the crisis in Southeast Asia should be to reconsider their respective policies towards Southeast Asia. The past policies and practices of dealing with colonies cannot be applied to this era. The alarm bell in Indonesia has already rung, how can we deceive ourselves and repeat our mistakes? We hope that the political diplomats of the great powers can quickly make wise choices regarding the crisis in Southeast Asia!

### Success Comes from Diligence and Thrift, Failure from Extravagance: Ninety-Year-Old General Sa Zhenbing Supports the Campaign to Promote National Construction through Thrift and Encourages Compatriots to Abandon the Concept of Luxury

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 23rd] General Sa Zhenbing, a highly respected and lifelong thrifty elder of the navy, who is now ninety years old, expressed his sincere support for President Chiang’s campaign to build the nation through diligence and thrift. When reporters visited him and inquired about his opinions, he said: "Success comes from diligence and thrift, failure from extravagance" has been true since ancient times. The people of our country have always been known for their diligence and thrift, but in recent times, social customs have deteriorated, and the general public has become accustomed to luxury, living in comfort and indulging in extravagance, causing legitimate income to be unable to sustain their extravagant lives. This has led to opportunistic and corrupt behavior, creating a bad social atmosphere. He believes that the President’s wise call is something that all people in the country should thoroughly follow today. Elder Sa said: I entered the Mawei Naval Academy at the age of eleven. At that time, my family was poor, with parents above me and a younger sister below me. At that time, my monthly allowance from the school was five dollars and fifty cents. Except for the forty cents I used for myself, the rest was sent home for household expenses. If we were not diligent and thrifty, our family's life would not have been able to be sustained. He compared today's national situation to a large family in difficulty. The nation, as children and younger brothers, must save every penny and work together to help. Although he is a highly respected figure in China's naval circles, with a reputation that has shaken the world, and has held high positions in the central government, he has no permanent property when he retires in his old age. His current residence is "Ren Shou Tang," donated by people in central Fujian, with three humble houses, plain clothes, and simple food. He spends his days wielding his pen, and the proceeds from his writing are used to help the poor, so the people of Fujian all call him "Living Bodhisattva." He encouraged his compatriots by saying: "I don't smoke, don't drink, don't eat meat, and don't gamble, and my spirit is not painful at all, and my body is quite healthy. I have lived to be ninety years old this year. If everyone can make up their minds to abandon the concept of luxury, be diligent, thrifty, and frugal, it will not only benefit oneself, but also benefit the country." A month ago, he was entrusted to provide disaster relief to the victims of the flood in Rong City. He personally went door-to-door to provide relief. In the streets of Rong City, the elderly man was often seen walking slowly, never taking a car, and standing for several hours in public commemorative gatherings, looking cheerful. At his age of ninety, he is still able to be diligent, thrifty, endure hardship, and be sweet, which is truly commendable and a model for us. In addition, people from all walks of life in Fujian Province, in response to the President’s campaign to build the nation through diligence, thrift, and frugality, have prepared to organize a provincial-level guidance committee. Counties and cities have established promotion committees. The Rural City Military Officers Association gathered to discuss and solicit effective ways to promote it.

### Rong Elderly Man Liu Yubo Explains the Meaning of "Diligence" and "Thrift"

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 23rd] Liu Yubo, the only surviving member of Chengdu's "Five Elders," is 91 years old. He is known for his diligence and thrift in scholarship, and his poems, calligraphy, and paintings are well-known at the time. He lives a thrifty life and still has sharp ears and eyes and an excellent memory. When reporters visited him, he was resting on his bed. When he talked about President Chiang's thrift campaign, he gladly sat up and said to the reporter with a smile: "Good, good, you must be diligent to establish yourself, you must be thrifty to manage affairs, you must be diligent and thrifty to build the nation." He pointed to a small booklet he had written in front of the bed, "Advocating Merit and Simplicity," and told the reporter that this article was written in the early years of the Republic of China, and today he feels even more the necessity of promoting the thrift campaign. The elderly man's explanation of the words "diligence" and "thrift" said: "We should be diligent in improving our virtue and learning, fearing that we are not diligent enough. Dayu even cherished every inch of time, and was not burdened by food, clothing, music, or profit. Only diligence can make achievements. Thrift is a general principle. There is a clear instruction from ancient times: thrift makes the will concise, concise the will and peaceful the heart, peaceful the heart and clear the spirit. This can be used to study and manage affairs. Therefore, those who are diligent must be thrifty, and those who are thrifty can be diligent."

### Executive Yuan Formulates Measures for the Use of Special Disaster Relief Donations

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The fundraising for the special disaster relief donations is about to end. The Executive Yuan has now formulated three measures for the use of funds to ensure rational and effective utilization.

The expenses required for handling the special disaster relief donations will be coordinated and allocated by the Ministry of Social Affairs from the special disaster relief donation funds. These measures will be discussed at the next Executive Yuan meeting, and if approved, they will be implemented accordingly.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The case of Dong Jianping (Jianping), a section chief of the Peiping Municipal Government who caused a sensation in Peiping and Tientsin, was transferred to the Capital Higher Special Criminal Court by the National Defense Ministry's Bureau of Confidential Affairs.

### Still Needs Work to Stabilize the Economy in Peiping: Citizens Buy the Worst Goods at the Highest Price Limit; Merchants Do Everything to Prevent Surprise Inspections

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 23rd] Economic controls in Peiping still need work. The deadline for exchanging gold, silver, and foreign currencies is less than a week away, and the amount received so far is considered small by many, reflecting the weak confidence of merchants and citizens in prices. Citizens are suffering from buying the worst goods at the highest price limit, but there have been no reports of complaints or accusations. Except for corn flour, other grains and flours are not easy to buy. The distribution of rationed flour is slow, and disputes over purchases occur several times a day. Since the so-called mislabeling of prices by the China Textile Corporation, it has been distributing cloth for several days in a row. The price of cloth has remained within the price limit, but on the 23rd, it also rose. Most markets are quiet and lack active trading. In the past two days, goods with price limits announced by the Municipal Government have quickly become scarce, and merchants are doing everything to prevent surprise inspections.

The authorities believe that the number of exchanges and deposits last time was too small, and the wait-and-see attitude still exists. In addition, after the stocks of five state-owned enterprises were put on sale in Peiping on the 21st, there were not many buyers. 294 shares were sold on the first day and 56 shares were sold on the second day.

### Hong Kong Wing On Warehouse; Fire Burns for 26 Hours; Estimated Losses Reach More Than HK$20 Million

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 23rd] The fire at the Wing On Warehouse in Hong Kong has not been extinguished as of the morning of the 23rd. A total of 16 buildings have been destroyed, 114 people have been injured, including 50 seriously injured, and the death toll remains at 18. The long duration of the fire is unprecedented in Hong Kong's history. Estimated losses reach more than HK$20 million. The warehouse contained a large amount of cloth, raw rubber, tung oil, printing paper, etc., all of which are flammable, making firefighting very difficult. It is reported that there are also several thousand pieces of cotton yarn and 500-600 bales of cotton, hoarded by a major merchant in Guangzhou. The cause of the fire is unknown.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 22nd] After burning for 26 hours, the fire at the Wing On Warehouse here was brought under control this afternoon. 115 charred and unidentifiable bodies were recovered. Most of the bodies were found at the stairwells, indicating that the deceased struggled to escape. However, due to the rapid spread of thick smoke and flames, they perished.

### Marshall Formally Informs All Nations; Emphasizes That Human Rights Should Be Highly Respected; Hopes to Conclude Japanese and Austrian Peace Treaties Soon; General Debate of the United Nations General Assembly Commenced Yesterday

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] The general debate of the United Nations General Assembly commenced today. The Philippine representative, Romulo, delivered a speech in English, calling on major powers to make renewed efforts to find peaceful solutions to current differences, so that humanity has the opportunity to achieve more solid security guarantees within the United Nations framework, in order to create benefits for everyone in the world. He also stated that small countries can, through joint efforts and collective strength, act as a third force to uphold peace, assisting major powers in preventing war. In the past few weeks, Romulo has been the center of attention for people all over the world. Both today and during the United Nations General Assembly, Paris will be the center of attention. Romulo further emphasized that this General Assembly is convened at the most important time in world history, and this meeting will also determine the fate of war and peace in the world.

[Associated Press, Paris, 23rd] Following Romulo, U.S. Secretary of State Marshall rose to speak, solemnly declaring that the United States is unwilling to compromise on fundamental principles and "will not sacrifice the rights and freedoms of other people as commodities for trade."

In his speech, Marshall echoed Romulo's war warning. He cited the United Nations Charter's guarantee to save future generations from the scourge of war, "But we not only have the need to rescue our descendants, we must also rescue ourselves today." Marshall did not mention the Berlin issue, but continued, "The United States is unwilling to add fuel to the fire in the current situation. The United States sincerely desires to reduce international tension." He appealed to all member states to find ways to improve the situation, and warned that countless people around the world are eagerly awaiting this important meeting, "We should not disappoint them." He attributed the world's difficulties to "the systematic and deliberate denial of fundamental human rights." Although he did not directly mention the Soviet Union, he stated, "It is entirely wrong that millions of men and women live in terror of secret police every day, facing the threat of arrest, imprisonment, and forced labor." Marshall further stated that the work of the United Nations has been quite effective in the past year, "But even though the majority of countries are willing to cooperate and rebuild peace and prosperity, the situation has deteriorated in the past year. The rulers of certain countries are creating deep divisions within their own countries and in the world. We must not allow this division to widen further." Marshall denied that peacemaking is only a matter for major powers, and stressed that it involves countless governments and countless people. "On issues that need to be resolved, both large and small countries must express their opinions and seek global consensus." The focus of Marshall's speech was on the need to respect individual freedoms and rights. He earnestly urged the General Assembly to pass the draft of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with an "overwhelming majority." He warned that "A government that systematically violates the rights of its own people will not respect the rights of other countries and other people, and will inevitably use international intimidation and force to achieve its goals."

### Seeking to Achieve Peaceful Goals in Addressing Various Issues

In addition to appealing for the passage of the Declaration of Human Rights, he stated that the United States hopes to achieve the following goals, which are also the goals of the General Assembly:

Palestine: To establish a Palestine free from war and the threat of war, with guarantees for the peaceful development of both Arabs and Jews, and to allow Transjordan and Israel to join the United Nations.

Korea: An independent and unified Korea, recognized by the United Nations, with free elections for Koreans to produce a constitution and government.

Greece: Greece should not be harmed by illegal external aggression.

Indonesia: There should be no more bloodshed in Indonesia, and both sides should resolve everything through negotiations.

India-Pakistan Dispute: Regarding Kashmir, India and Pakistan should continue mediation and compromise.

Atomic Energy: An international system for controlling atomic energy should be adopted as soon as possible.

Disarmament: Under reliable and appropriate guarantees, progressive and rapid disarmament should be implemented.

After Marshall finished speaking, the Soviet delegation sat silently, unwilling to applaud. Marshall also put forward three major points on the world's dangerous situation:

First, the United States will do its best to resolve the current situation in "appropriate institutions." Second, "If we want peace, we must resolve the problems caused by the last World War." Third, the world should strive to conclude German, Japanese, and Austrian peace treaties "early and fairly."

Marshall's language was moderate and devoid of emotional outbursts, in stark contrast to the first speaker from the Soviet bloc, Polish representative Modzelewski. Modzelewski heavily criticized the Berlin airlift, calling it an "absurd aerial bridge," and that transporting coal into Berlin by plane was an "economic fallacy." He also vehemently denounced the Marshall Plan as rebuilding West Germany into a satellite of the West, "in order to revive aggression," making Germany its "master's tool, a reactionary and reorientation outpost, and a springboard for conquering the world."

### Representatives of Venezuela and Egypt Speak

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 23rd Broadcast: The United Nations General Assembly continued its meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd. The Venezuelan Foreign Minister spoke in favor of the continued existence of a "small General Assembly" and advocated that the Security Council's veto power should be restricted. The Egyptian Foreign Minister denounced Jewish immigration to the Holy Land as threatening peace in the Middle East and the world. At this point, Eivat announced that the General Assembly would be adjourned until tomorrow morning.

### Bernadotte's Proposals Not Fully Endorsed by the Jewish Side

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] A spokesman for the unofficial committee of Israel attending the United Nations General Assembly stated at a press conference today: The proposal in the Bernadotte report to recognize Israel's independence is satisfactory, but the Israeli government cannot fully accept the resolutions in the report. In particular, the Israeli government opposes the violation of the proposals of the previous United Nations Investigation Committee and the proposal to demarcate the Negev out of Israel's territory.

### General Assembly Agenda; Includes Seventy Items; General Committee Conducting Discussions

[Central News Agency, Paris, 22nd] The provisional agenda, comprising seventy items, includes the most difficult issues facing the United Nations, such as Palestine, Korea, the Balkans, and the Security Council's veto power. The General Committee spent most of its time today discussing what should be included in the agenda and what should be removed, and will submit the agenda to the General Assembly for formal adoption. Soviet representative Vyshinsky condemned Western countries for attempting to create a "disunited" United Nations. However, the Soviet Union repeatedly tried to prevent the General Assembly from discussing issues such as Korea, Greece, the Security Council's veto power, and the admission of new member states, but was ultimately rejected by the General Committee by a majority vote. This year's agenda includes the original 45 items, 20 supplementary items, and 5 finally submitted items, including the Palestine issue, the Italian colonies issue, and the United Nations Security Guard issue. According to the Soviet Union's consistent practice, it may raise major issues during the debate in the General Assembly, as it may do this year.

### Nationwide Labor Strike for Two Hours in France

Government Agrees to Workers' Wage Increase Demands

[Our Dispatch] London, 23rd Broadcast, Paris News: The French government decided on the 23rd to approve a 15% wage increase for French workers. This percentage increase is smaller than that demanded by both communist and non-communist unions.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] The two-hour symbolic strike in France will be held in cities across the country from 4 to 6 p.m. on the 24th. Public transportation throughout Paris will be completely suspended, and the city government and all public utilities will be shut down.

### Three Powers Make Final Attempt; New Note to Soviet Union; Demanding Resolution of Berlin Incident

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 22nd] The governments of Britain, the United States, and France today submitted a new note to Moscow regarding the Berlin issue. In the note, the three countries agreed to the French Foreign Minister's suggestion to postpone the German issue to the United Nations and continue negotiations by the four countries, with the issues for negotiation limited to the blockade of Berlin and seeking to unify the Berlin currency system under four-power joint management. However, Western officials are confident that if the Soviet response is unsatisfactory, the Berlin issue will be fully debated in the United Nations.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] Bevin declared in the House of Commons today, "Britain believes that the Soviet Union's opening of the Berlin blockade is the main condition for resolving the Berlin issue. The Western three countries are not only in complete agreement on Berlin policy, but also have reached a consensus on what the three countries should do after negotiations fail. It is a big mistake to say that Britain wants war. We still hope that a unified German government can be established sooner or later." Referring to US-Soviet relations, Bevin said, "I believe that the East and West can coexist and prosper together. I am prepared to live together peacefully, and I ask the other party to also live peacefully in the 'areas they have acquired.'"

### Indonesian Government Troops Advance in Three Routes; Attack Communist Troops in Madiun City; United Nations Good Offices Committee is Conducting Reconciliation

[Associated Press, Batavia, 23rd] It was learned on the 23rd that the government of the Republic of Indonesia has begun an offensive against the communist rebels in East Java, and government troops have advanced to within twelve miles of Madiun City, the center of the coup. Antara, the official news agency of the Republic, reported that a full-scale offensive against the communist-held city began on the 21st, with government troops advancing towards Madiun City from three directions. Fighting is taking place around Madiun Airport, six miles from the city, and near Ngarai, eighteen miles northeast of the city.

The communist troops around Madiun City number about 3,000. They also launched an offensive near Nagertables, a railway intersection twenty-five miles east of the city, but government troops defeated and disarmed the socialist youth army, the elite force of the communist troops. The army has surrendered to the government. Radio Jogjakarta broadcast that government troops have advanced to within twelve miles of Madiun City. "The government military commanders are confident that the recovery of Madiun City will be achieved in the shortest possible time."

[Associated Press, Batavia, 22nd] Indonesia ordered a ban on gatherings of more than ten people on the 22nd. Radio Jogjakarta announced the ban, saying that this measure will be taken during the emergency period.

[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] Deputy Secretary of State Lovett told reporters on the 22nd that Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker's recent visit here was purely to exchange views with U.S. officials. Asked whether Stikker had requested assistance in the Indonesian affair and whether the State Department had made such a assistance proposal, Lovett replied that Stikker provided the State Department with a great deal of information. He did not elaborate further. Asked whether the United States would take steps to help the Netherlands or Indonesian nationalists suppress Indonesian communists, Lovett declined to comment, but pointed out that the United States is a member of the Good Offices Committee sent by the United Nations to the area, and the committee is trying to bring the opposing parties together. At the same time, those in charge pointed out that the US government considers the situation in Indonesia to be very serious. Some officials said that there is good reason to believe that the communist movement to seize power in Southeast Asia is partly aimed at undermining the European Recovery Program. They explained that some European countries rely on the benefits of investment in Southeast Asia, and these benefits have been lost due to the unrest launched by the communists.

### Soviet Union Admits Deep Cracks in Communist International; Urges Eastern European Countries to Unite; Report of Meeting in Southern Russia Needs to be Verified

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] The arrival of Czech President Gottwald in Crimea, and the fact that Stalin is also vacationing there, have led diplomats here to believe that Moscow's satellite countries are currently meeting in Southern Russia. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov may also participate. The whereabouts of Romanian Foreign Minister Anna Pauker and Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov are the subject of much speculation here. Both countries' embassies in the United States have made no comment.

[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] In its most candid review of the disputes within the Communist International, Moscow Radio told the Soviet people that they can expect to find stronger communist resistance within the Soviet Union's vassal states. In addition to mentioning the break between Yugoslavia and the Cominform, the broadcast also mentioned the general struggles within the "new democratic countries" of Eastern Europe. The broadcast was titled "The International Communist Movement," has been listened to here, and provided to top government officials for reference.

The broadcast stated that such developments within the party are merely a painful but unsurprising process. Communist parties outside the Soviet Union will achieve great success and triumph everywhere if they uphold the leadership of the Soviet Union and follow "Stalinism."

It stated that public opinion after the break between Tito and the Cominform has actually strengthened the communist movement. This event has prompted "correct reassessment" of their environment in various places and obtained "necessary conclusions". Soviet assistance is the only reason for the eastward trend towards communism in Eastern Europe today, but it is clear that the class struggle within the "new democratic countries" will become more acute, and the use of class resistance will become stronger. The class struggle within foreign communist parties is becoming increasingly clear, and the struggle between the two major fronts has emerged, as we have experienced before. The development of communism cannot be completed without overcoming the struggle of opportunists."

### British Foreign Secretary Returns to Paris

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] British Foreign Secretary Bevin returned to Paris this morning after a day's stay in London, and immediately drove to the British Embassy to discuss the Berlin incident with Roberts, Strang, and Robertson.

### Foreign Minister Wang Shih-chieh and Nehru to Meet in France

Discussing Issues of Mutual Interest

[Central News Agency, Paris, 22nd] This reporter has just learned from people close to our country's delegation to the United Nations General Assembly that Foreign Minister Wang Shih-chieh plans to meet with Indian Prime Minister Nehru in mid-October to discuss issues of mutual interest. Nehru will attend the British Prime Minister's Conference in London in October and is expected to come here as the chief representative of India to participate in the United Nations General Assembly before or after attending the conference. The attitudes of China and India are exactly the same on several issues in the General Assembly, and to some extent, the attitudes of China and India are the same as those of the Arab countries.

### British Blame Chinese for Malayan Rebellion

British Participate in Movement to Overthrow Government

[Associated Press, London, 22nd] British Colonial Secretary Jones stated in the House of Commons on the 22nd that the left-wing rebels in Malaya are "mainly Chinese." He said that the situation there is gradually coming under control. About 186 civilians have died, most of whom were Chinese who refused to help the terrorists. About 158 terrorists have been killed, 200 have been captured, and more have been detained for investigation. Jones estimated that the terrorists number about 35,000, but he declined to disclose the number of British troops, only stating that there are 17,000 special police participating in the war there.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] US Undersecretary of State Matthews stated that some leads in Rangoon indicate that some British people are participating in the Karen movement to overthrow the Burmese government, but "the British government firmly opposes these activities."

### Dewey Delivers Campaign Speech; Demands U.S. Provide Massive Aid to China; Past Aid to China Was Insufficient

[Central News Agency Reporter Accompanying Dewey's Campaign Train, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 3rd] Republican presidential candidate Dewey called for increased US aid to China tonight. He put aside his previously prepared speech and denounced the "useless and insufficient" US aid to China, saying, "Our aid to China is insufficient and should be greatly increased." In the past year, he has repeatedly accused the United States of insufficient aid to China, so it is expected that if he is elected president, he may ask Congress to increase material, financial, and military aid to China to help China's reconstruction and construction and to eradicate communism.

### South Korea Believes North Korea's Military Strength is Formidable; Soviet Withdrawal is Not a Propaganda Offensive

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 23rd] Following the Soviet Union's declaration that the withdrawal of Soviet troops from North Korea would be completed by New Year's Day next year, South Korean circles have expressed neither surprise nor excitement. Most commentators take a realistic attitude, believing that the Soviet move is not a propaganda offensive. The withdrawal of Soviet troops from North Korea will not only not harm the Soviet Union's current position in Korea but will also place it in a favorable position in international politics. The local military strength trained by the Soviet Union in North Korea is nearly 200,000. In his recent policy address, Premier Kim Il-sung of the People's Republic of Korea also emphasized that the "People's Army" will aim for one million troops to resist foreign aggression and defend the motherland. In this situation, Soviet troops can withdraw from North Korea without fear. Furthermore, North Korea borders the Soviet Union, and Soviet troops can still reinforce the Korean border at any time if necessary. Secondly, after the withdrawal of Soviet troops from North Korea, the Soviet Union will have an excuse to demand the withdrawal of US troops stationed in South Korea, which will inevitably put the US and South Korean governments in an embarrassing position. At the same time, it will enhance the position of the Soviet Union and the North Korean regime. Moreover, what everyone fears is that after the withdrawal of Soviet troops from North Korea, the North Korean communist army will launch a "southern invasion," because at that time, the Soviet Union and North Korea will have no legal or ostensible relationship. A North Korean military advance southward will not cause a direct conflict between the US and the Soviet Union.

### Japan's Biggest Corruption Case; Ashida Implicated

Involving a Wide Range of People, the Case May End Without a Conclusion

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] The biggest news here recently concerns the Showa Denko scandal, with over a thousand suspects under investigation, including the current Prime Minister, Hitoshi Ashida.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 23rd] Well-informed observers predicted today that the Showa Denko bribery case, one of the largest corruption scandals in modern Japanese history, may soon end without a conclusion because so many important people are involved. Justice Minister Suzuki said on the 22nd: If this matter involves several cabinet members, it will inevitably lead to the resignation of the cabinet. After Suzuki issued the statement, Finance Minister Kurisu immediately denied that he and Prime Minister Ashida were involved in the case.

### Resolution of the Palestine-Jewish Dispute; Bernadotte's Full Proposal; Arab-Jewish Partition to Establish Lasting Peace (Conclusion)

However, the provisions regarding borders in the UN General Assembly resolution of November 29th of last year should be amended as follows to make them fairer, more appropriate, and more implementable in light of the current actual situation in Palestine: (A) The so-called Negev region, south of a line drawn from the coast near El Majdal, east of Faluja, should be designated as Arab territory (Faluja and El Majdal will both be Arab territories). (B) The boundary line should run from Faluja in a northeasterly direction to Ramle and Lydda (Ramle and Lydda will both be Arab territories); from Lydda, the boundary line will follow the provisions of the UN General Assembly resolution of November 29th. (C) Galilee should be designated as Jewish territory; (C) All areas not included within the borders of the Jewish state should be handled jointly by the Arab League government and the Arab residents of Palestine. However, given the historical relationship and common interests between Transjordan and Palestine, there is reason to merge Palestinian Arab territory and Transjordan territory. As for amendments to the borders of other Arab countries, if possible and necessary, they should still be implemented. (D) The United Nations should provide special guarantees, either through a declaration or other appropriate means, that the borders between Arab and Jewish territories should be respected and maintained, and only amended with the mutual agreement of the parties concerned. (E) Although the port of Haifa is included within the territory of the Jewish state, and the city of Haifa is managed by the Jewish state, the port (including its oil refining facilities and the terminal of the oil pipeline) should be declared a free port; guarantee free access to the port for all Arab countries, and Arab countries should not impede the passage of oil through the pipeline to the refinery in Haifa. The distribution of oil will continue to be handled according to past practices. (F) Lydda Airport should be declared a free airport, guaranteeing access to the airport and the use of its facilities for Jerusalem and the Arab countries concerned. (G) The area included within the city of Jerusalem should be treated separately in accordance with the provisions of the UN General Assembly resolution of November 29th, and should be placed under the effective control of the United Nations, so that the local Arab and Jewish residents can enjoy the maximum degree of appropriate autonomy, so that the holy sites and their monuments, as well as religious freedom, are fully protected, and can be freely accessed. (H) All parties should fully respect the right of free access to Jerusalem by road, rail, or air. (I) The United Nations should affirm the right of Arab refugees to return to their homes in the Jewish-controlled areas as soon as possible, and the supervision and assistance of their resettlement, reoccupation, economic and social reconstruction, and appropriate compensation for the loss of property of those who do not wish to return home should be supervised and assisted by the United Nations Conciliation Commission mentioned in section (K) below. (J) The authorities should fully guarantee and respect the political, economic, social, and religious rights of all Arabs in the Jewish territory of Palestine and all Jews in the Arab territory. The Conciliation Commission stipulated in the following section shall supervise the implementation of this guarantee. The committee must also, at the invitation of both parties, engage in mediation in any effort to exchange residents, so as to eliminate all troublesome minority problems, based on appropriate compensation for property losses. (K) Given the special nature of the Palestinian issue and the dangerous complexity of Jewish-Arab relations, the United Nations should establish a Palestinian Investigation Committee. The mandate of the committee, which has a fixed term, should be accountable to the United Nations and act under the jurisdiction of the United Nations. The committee, which is assisted by United Nations personnel when necessary, should be responsible for the following: (1) To use its mediation position to submit appropriate recommendations to the variable or to the United Nations, and take appropriate steps to ensure that the situation in Palestine continues to guarantee a peaceful adjustment; (2) To take measures that the committee deems appropriate to foster friendly relations between Arabs and Jews; (3) To supervise compliance with the boundaries, roads, railways, free ports, free airports, minority rights, and agreements determined by the United Nations; (4) To promptly report to the United Nations any development in Palestine that is sufficient to change any agreement approved by the United Nations in resolving the Palestinian issue, or to threaten the peace of the region.

### Lin Wang Company Speculation Case; Central Special Criminal Court Approves Original Judgment; Wang Chunzhe to be Executed Within Days; Re-trial File and Execution Order Sent to Shanghai Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] The Central Special Criminal Court in the capital, on the 20th, after deliberation by a panel of five judges, upheld the death sentence in the re-trial of Wang Chunzhe of the Lin Wang Company, and approved its execution. On the 23rd, a special envoy was dispatched to Shanghai with the full re-trial file and the execution order from the Ministry of Justice. The execution is expected to take place within days. The Central Special Criminal Court decided on the death penalty for Wang Chunzhe of the Lin Wang Company because Wang illegally engaged in black market trading of gold, banknotes, Hong Kong dollars, and US dollars. The large scale of illegal speculation between November 1947 and March/April 1948 was sufficient to impact the national economy and cause social unrest. After the government announced emergency economic measures to reform the currency system, the company continued to operate on the black market, with transactions spanning New York, San Francisco, London, Hong Kong, and Shantou. This clearly constituted a deliberate violation of government laws, disruption of finance, and obstruction of suppressing the rebellion. The Shanghai High Special Criminal Court sentenced him to death on September 3rd, and this sentence should be approved for execution.

### Pilot Zhang Enbo Arrested for Selling Gold; Transferred to Special Criminal Court

[Our Report] Zhang Enbo, a pilot of the Air Navigation Group of the Civil Aviation Administration's Air Transport Corps, was previously suspected of selling gold on the black market. He was apprehended by the police's Economic Crime Division in Room 604 of the Dongya Hotel on Nanjing East Road. On the spot, two suspected letters, 57.4 taels of gold bars and gold nuggets, and US$225 were seized.

### Four Banks Suspected of Creating False Accounts; District Attorney's Office Begins Investigation

### Comprehensive Registration of Goods and Raw Materials; Deadline of Five Days for Merchants and Factories; Authorities Also Plan City-Wide General Inspection

[Our Report] Chiang Ching-kuo convened the seventh Economic Inspection Meeting at 11:00 AM yesterday morning, attended by Zhang Shi, Cheng Yi-kuan, Yu Ji-yu, and other relevant personnel. After discussion, it was generally agreed that the initial work of economic control in the city had come to an end. In the future, the focus of the Supervisory Office's work will shift to increasing production and developing commerce. Preparations have already begun. To understand the existing commodities and raw materials in the city, the authorities decided to implement a comprehensive registration. All factories and merchants are required to register the nature and total amount of their stored goods and raw materials with their respective trade associations within the deadline of the 25th to 30th of this month, and the associations will issue registration certificates for verification. The items that must be registered include rice, flour, yarn, cloth, paper, cooking oil, and industrial raw materials. After registration, all stores must strictly sell goods at the fixed price. After the registration is completed, the managing authorities plan to conduct a city-wide general inspection with a force of 5,000 people. If unregistered commodities and raw materials are found, they will be confiscated and the owners will be severely punished.

### Grain Prices Reported Rising in Production Areas; Ban on Rushing to Purchase in Wuxi

During yesterday's meeting, the city's rice prices were also discussed. It was believed that the recent rise in rice prices in the city was mainly due to reports of rising prices in the Wuxi production area, and the rise in rice prices in Wuxi was due to panic buying from various parties. The Supervisory Office has negotiated with all parties, and in the future, no party will be allowed to rush to purchase in Wuxi. The rise in Shanghai rice prices has been eliminated, so under no circumstances is it allowed to break the fixed price. According to investigations, the city currently has enough grain reserves to last at least half a month. With a continuous supply from other ports in the future, there is no fear of a grain shortage.

Regarding the collection of gold, silver, and foreign currency, the Ministry of Finance has decided to set a deadline. Incidents of carrying gold and banknotes out of the country have already occurred. The Supervisory Office has ordered inspectors to pay close attention.

### Social Bureau Sets Registration Forms

[Our Report] According to Wu Kai-xian, Director of the Social Bureau, regarding the registration of inventory, the Social Bureau has set the registration forms and instructed the relevant commercial associations to instruct their members to fill in the forms in detail and report them to the Social Bureau by the 30th of this month, and then the bureau will collect and submit them to the Economic Supervisory Office. In the future, members of the Suppression and Construction Brigade will be sent to various places for random inspections. If any concealment or false reporting is found, the goods will be confiscated and the offenders will be punished.

Regarding the industrial raw materials of various factories, the Social Bureau has instructed the Municipal Industrial Association to instruct various factories to report the amount of existing storage, how long it can be maintained, what raw materials are needed, and where they come from before the end of this month, and will try to help solve their problems.

### Confiscated Goods Will Be Auctioned

[Our Report] According to Director Wu of the Social Bureau, a portion of the sugar confiscated in the city has been decided to be sold off. The disposal of other items such as cotton yarn and cloth is being requested from the Executive Yuan. These materials are currently being sorted out. Some owners of the goods stated that these goods were cotton supplied by the Foreign Trade Association for spinning or entrusted by the headquarters for spinning, and the relevant agencies were notified after the goods were completed, but they did not come to pick them up, so the factories that spun them should not be held responsible. The Social Bureau is investigating this situation. If the goods are indeed public property, the public agencies will be notified to pick them up; otherwise, transfer procedures will be processed. Most of the confiscated materials will be auctioned.

### Okamura's Condition Worsens; Will Be Transferred to Hospital for Treatment

Okamura Yasuji, the former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, after being publicly tried by the Military Tribunal of the National Defense Ministry for war criminals on August 22nd and 23rd, was returned to the Jiangwan Shanghai War Criminals Prison to await interrogation. It has been learned that Okamura's pulmonary disease has recurred in prison and is becoming increasingly serious. Although the Military Tribunal has hired famous doctors to treat him, there has been no improvement. To prevent a dramatic change in Okamura's condition, the Military Tribunal will transfer him from the Jiangwan Shanghai War Criminals Prison to a certain hospital for treatment within days. Therefore, the further trial of Okamura is expected to be delayed for some time.

### Four Ships Arrive Tomorrow; Carrying 9,000 Tons of Rice; October Rationing Ends at the End of the Month

According to information from the People's Livelihood Survey Committee, the Lin Ge and Hai Qian ships, carrying a large amount of Taiwanese rice to Shanghai, were originally scheduled to arrive on the 22nd, but due to the severe maritime climate, they will be delayed until tomorrow (25th). In addition, the Hai Huang and Chenggong ships, also carrying a large amount of imported rice, will also arrive tomorrow.

In addition, the committee had previously approved the citizens' request to extend the rice rationing period by five days until the end of this month, which has been formally approved by Chairman Wu Guozhen.

### Measures for Punishing Jewelry Stores for Violations Approved; Lao Qingyun's Circumstances are More Serious; Should Be Transferred to Court for Investigation; Fang Jiuxia, Yongji, and 14 Other Stores to be Dealt with Leniency

[Our Report] The Ministry of Finance has approved the following measures for punishing the 15 jewelry stores in the city suspected of privately operating gold bars, which were investigated by the Financial Administration Bureau: (1) Lao Qingyun has been found to be melting gold bars after August 19th of this year, and two gold bars and more than 16 taels of silver were seized on the spot. In addition, there were changes in the gold receipts and payments on the store's accounts. In August, the daily receipts and payments reached tens of taels.

(2) The remaining 14 stores, including Fang Jiuxia and Yongji, have not been found to have conclusive evidence of gold trading, and will be dealt with leniently in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 of the Measures for Handling Gold and Foreign Currency Owned by the People. The seized gold and silver bars and foreign currency will be sent to the Central Bank for collection and exchange, and the price will be returned after a written guarantee is obtained.

The Ministry of Finance stated that the above punishments were lenient in consideration of the people.

Furthermore, the government has repeatedly stated that the collection of gold, silver, and foreign currency will end at the end of September. All jewelry stores should hand over all gold bars to the Central Bank or its entrusted banks for collection and exchange within the deadline. If any concealment of gold is found next month, it will be confiscated according to the law and severely punished.

[Our Report] In order to discuss the supply and demand of raw materials for production and other issues for various important industries in the city, the Municipal Industrial Association convened responsible persons and technicians from the rubber, papermaking, paint making, oil pressing, soap making, leather making, enamel, and flavoring industries at 10:00 AM and 3:00 PM yesterday. In general, the price of finished products has been frozen after the government's "819" price limit, while raw materials are still rising. The difficulty in purchasing diesel and coal fuel makes it likely that work will be suspended at any time. The paper industry's wood pulp quota is only one-tenth of the required amount. At the same time, if the main raw materials for papermaking, such as rags and paper scraps, are purchased at the limited price, they must be mixed with a large amount of garbage and colored waste paper, which cannot be used. The Industrial Association will collect as much information as possible on these difficulties to provide as reference for the authorities, and suggest that ways to effectively improve the situation be found. The Industrial Association will continue to convene chemical raw materials, ink, cement, and other industries today for talks.

Chiang encouraged all staff members: (1) Work should have a clear goal. Economic work is to save the country and the people, not to make money. (2) You should recognize your own responsibilities. Staff members represent the national government in implementing economic laws. (3) Economic inspection staff must break face and sacrifice personal feelings, and cut off social relationships with relatives and friends to avoid being implicated. (4) A new atmosphere should be established. There should be no improper actions. Comrades in charge should monitor, encourage, advise, and report on each other. Only in this way can the work be successful. If one person's actions are unsafe, the entire work will be affected. (5) The members of the Suppression and Construction Team are responsible for assisting the Economic Police Brigade in performing the nature of their work. There should be no distance or boundaries between each other. They should unite sincerely and integrate into one. Chiang said at the end: We are implementing economic tasks in accordance with the government's economic laws and regulations, so personnel should not have any scruples when performing this task, but must be very careful.

### Source of National Medicine Also Becomes a Problem
Moreover, amidst the panic surrounding Western medicine, the selling price of national medicine is also facing reduced sources and difficulty in sales due to significant price differences across regions.

Zhou Naihao Prosecuted for Maliciously Accusing Ding Hao of Drug Use Due to Personal Grievances
Zhou Naihao, the Director-General of the China Relief for Women and Children General Association, had disagreements with Ding Hao, the Chief Secretary of the association, and harbored resentment. Recently, Zhou Naihao was accused by Ding Hao in the District Procuratorate of crimes such as fraud, embezzlement, and obstruction of freedom. Therefore, Zhou Naihao also intended to subject Ding Hao to criminal punishment. On July 6 of this year, he colluded with his rickshaw puller, Pan Youli, and filed a complaint with the District Procuratorate, accusing Ding Hao of using the association's own rickshaw to go to the third floor of a building at the intersection of Shanxi Road and Beijing Road to use drugs since June of last year, while the rickshaw puller Pan Youli waited outside the alley, etc. After repeated investigations by the prosecutor, it was discovered that this was not the case and that the accusation was fabricated. Therefore, it was believed that the defendant had committed the crime of false accusation, and a public prosecution was formally filed against Zhou Naihao yesterday for the crime of false accusation, which will soon be transferred to the Criminal Court of the District Court for public trial.

The Term of the Regulations on Prohibiting Opium and Drugs Expires; District Court to Try Cases According to Our Laws
[This Newspaper Report] The responsible judge in charge of opium and drug cases in the District Court said yesterday: The Regulations on Prohibiting Opium and Drugs and Punishing Crimes expired on August 2 of this year, nearly two months ago. It is unknown whether they will continue to be valid, as the Legislative Yuan has not yet discussed and passed a resolution. Courts in various regions are at a high point in advocating for the elimination of opium and drugs, and it is also inconvenient to adjudicate according to the "Opium Chapter" of the ordinary criminal law. Therefore, it is only possible to temporarily suspend these cases and handle them after the laws and regulations are promulgated. As a result, opium addicts in custody are anxiously awaiting a decision, and the police and court personnel handling the cases are also worried and helpless. Everyone hopes that the Legislative Yuan will decide as soon as possible whether to extend the implementation period of the Regulations on Prohibiting Opium and Drugs and Punishing Crimes. It is reported that the District Procuratorate has already filed multiple cases according to the ordinary criminal law, but they are all backlogged and have not been processed.

According to the resolution of the general meeting, the above-mentioned company can proceed with procedures such as soliciting shares and formally establish itself first, and then submit it to the eighth general meeting of the Council for ratification. This company is closely related to the municipal construction of Shanghai, so the decision of the subcommittee meeting on the 27th is particularly important. It is hoped that if the subcommittee's review of the articles of association proceeds smoothly, commercial shares can be solicited starting in the middle of next month. The total amount of these commercial shares is equivalent to five million Gold Yuan, which should be of considerable help in absorbing idle funds and indirectly stabilizing prices.

Promote the Movement of Diligence and Thrift, Awaken Citizens to Practice It
A Meeting Was Held Yesterday at the Queen's Theatre
The Shanghai All-Circles Promotion of National Diligence and Thrift Movement Propaganda Meeting was held at 9:00 AM on the 23rd at the Queen's Theatre on Xizang Road. The presidium included Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Jin Longzhang, Jiang Weizhi, Zhu Jingnong, Du Yuesheng (represented by Zhu Wende), Xu Jiquing, Zhou Feicheng, Feng Youzhen, Zheng Yuxiu, Hou Junren, and more than 3,000 representatives from various circles. Zheng Yanye, a member of the Central Thrift Guidance Committee, and Ni Bi, a supervising committee member of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Administrative Office, were invited to attend and provide guidance. The meeting hall was decorated with large banners reading "Soldier-like Life on the Front Line" and "Civilian-like Life in the Rear." Mayor Wu served as the chairman and delivered a speech after leading the attendees in a group ceremony. He first pointed out the virtues of diligence and thrift advocated by Chinese sages and emphasized that the Chinese people should uphold the spirit of seeking from oneself rather than from others to overcome current difficulties. Currently, people's livelihoods are declining, and production is insufficient. The only solution is diligence and thrift. He hopes that the five million citizens of Shanghai will rise up and respond to the President's initiative to promote national diligence and thrift, so that the country can become prosperous and happy.

Speak Less About Rights, Emphasize Spirituality More
Then, Committee Member Zheng delivered a speech, stating: In order to awaken the general public to vigorously promote national diligence and thrift, propaganda is essential. However, propaganda should also grasp the key to practice and must be coordinated with organization. The implementation of this currency system reform has already made Shanghai a national model. It is hoped that all compatriots in the city will step up their efforts. The success of Shanghai is a prelude to the success of the entire country. Chairman Xu of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce delivered a speech, stating: Diligence and thrift must start from oneself and must have perseverance. Committee Member Ni Bi delivered a speech, stating: To quell the chaos, we must first eliminate the source of the chaos. In other words, we must ensure that everyone has food to eat. We must know that the poorer we are, the more chaotic it becomes, and the more chaotic it becomes, the poorer we are. We must eliminate the communist bandits' conspiracy to create poverty and chaos and exploit social crises to sell out the country. We must first learn diligence and thrift from Westerners, not just vainly admire the enjoyment of life. We should fulfill our obligations more and talk less about rights, emphasize spirituality more, and talk less about material things in order to build the country. Zhu Jingnong, speaking from the perspective of the education sector, hopes that everyone will do their best and take what they need. He hopes that Shanghai students will take the lead in advocating for movements such as wearing plain clothes and engaging in labor so that the education sector can become a model. Speaker Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, stating: The diligence and thrift movement advocated by the President is the movement of practice. The life of officers and soldiers on the front line should be soldier-like, and the life of wealthy people in the rear should be civilian-like. He also loudly called on the government to apply various policies and laws, such as heavily taxing luxury goods and using this tax revenue to specifically fund civilian welfare programs to achieve the goal of taking from the rich and using for the poor.

Do Your Best, Take What You Need
Committee Member Fang delivered a speech, first using a tone of feeling to point out the unreasonable phenomenon between luxurious life and civilian life, which should be eliminated. The most unfair thing in the world is the inequality in life, because inequality in life leads to inequality in people's hearts, eventually leading to bloody social revolution. The purpose of the revolution led by the Father of the Nation and the President is to seek the realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood, so that people's lives, social survival, the lives of the masses, and the livelihood of the country are all guaranteed. Today, we are awakening the working masses to this bloodless social movement and should practice the principle of "doing our best and taking what we need." He expressed his willingness to learn from the working masses and strive for thrift in his personal life in the future. His only hobby, cigarettes, will also be quit immediately, and he is willing to take the lead in taking off his suit and changing into a Zhongshan suit to advocate the movement of diligence and thrift in fact.

The Meeting Passed Telegram Proposals
At the meeting, two proposals and a telegram were passed. Finally, the entire meeting shouted slogans, and China Electric screened educational production films. The telegram and proposals of the meeting are recorded as follows:
To all compatriots across the country, transferred to all newspapers in provinces and cities across the country: Banditry is rampant, and social customs are declining. While soldiers are shedding blood to suppress bandits on the front lines, and compatriots are displaced and fleeing in all directions, the idle and extravagant officials, wealthy merchants and gentry, and parasitic elements speculate and exploit, indulge in extravagance, and indulge in enjoyment, disregarding the country and the nation and turning a blind eye to the suffering of their compatriots. If this trend is not corrected, the country will perish one day. Our President Chiang Kai-shek, with true knowledge and insight, clearly observed the ills of the times and initiated the National Diligence and Thrift Movement, calling on compatriots across the country to believe in and practice it, to fight injustice for society, to fight for the survival of the working masses, and to use it as a starting point for coordinating economic and political mobilization, transforming society, and thoroughly implementing the Principle of People's Livelihood. This meeting is deeply moved by the leader's sincere patriotism to save the country and the people and the importance of the National Diligence and Thrift Movement. It sincerely appeals and earnestly hopes that those who are lazy, extravagant, speculative, and exploitative will wake up in time, repent, abide by the covenant, refrain from extravagance, and vigorously practice diligence and thrift. It especially hopes that diligent people will sincerely persuade those who indulge in extravagance and pleasure and are idle and extravagant to turn back to the shore. Those who are obsessed and forget to return should be closely reported and given public opinion sanctions and moral condemnation. We must strive to revitalize social customs and create a new look, which will not only be a blessing for individuals but also a blessing for the country. Shanghai All-Circles Diligence and Thrift Promotion National Propaganda Conference Shen Geng Hou.

Proposals: (1) In order to vigorously promote thrift, it is proposed that the Executive Yuan promptly promulgate customary systems so that people's lives have something to follow and conform to the purpose of national diligence and thrift. (2) In order to enable people across the country to universally and deeply understand the meaning of the National Diligence and Thrift Movement, it is proposed that the central government compile a handbook on national diligence and thrift and distribute it to various provinces and cities to facilitate practice.
Business and Industry Fully Support
The City Industry Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, and the Local Association jointly telegraphed President Chiang yesterday, supporting the National Diligence and Thrift Movement he initiated and telegraphed various Tongle Guilds to respond in unison.
Also, all directors and supervisors of the City Bank Association, in response to the National Diligence and Thrift Movement, issued a statement to the industry yesterday, stating: On the evening of September 15, President Chiang initiated the Diligence and Thrift National Building Movement through radio broadcasting, formulated an outline, and announced it to the entire country. His words were earnest and moving. Our Bank Association is one of the professional organizations and should rise up in time, follow the trend, and promote this movement so that social customs can be changed, and all operations of our industry can naturally be brought into the right track. Now is the beginning of the Diligence and Thrift Movement. The Executive Yuan has established a Thrift Guidance Committee. Our industry believes that the relationship between diligence and thrift and production and consumption is extremely close, which can directly stabilize prices and indirectly consolidate the Gold Yuan. Under the premise of our industry's full support for the Gold Yuan, it is extremely necessary to work with the government to fulfill its responsibilities.
Levy Luxury Donation
The Objects are Dance Halls, Cafés and Wine Banquets, Which Will Be Transferred to Public Utilities as Subsidies
Regarding the promotion of the National Diligence and Thrift Movement in this city, the municipal authorities recently received instructions from the central government to levy luxury donations on all luxury goods and extravagant entertainment under the principle of prohibition in levying. According to the person in charge of the Thrift Movement Committee, the principle of levying luxury donations has been decided, and the specific methods of levying and donation rates are being drafted. However, the objects of luxury donation are difficult to determine and need to be discussed in detail with all relevant parties. As for the use of the luxury donation, it will be allocated to public utilities companies as subsidies to reduce the cost of public utilities and make their selling prices cheaper. Luxury donations will also be levied on dance halls, cafés, and wine banquets that are not thrifty.

A Record of the Rise and Fall of the Wuhu Rice Market
Special Correspondent of This Newspaper Zhu Minwei
(1) The History of the Wuhu Rice Market
The Wuhu Rice Market was established in the 8th year of the Guangxu Emperor's reign (1882) and has been around for 77 years. Originally, the Jiangnan rice markets were located in Zhenjiang Qihaokou, Wuxi, and Zhejiang Xiashi Town. Li Hongzhang, for the sake of hometown friendship, actually moved the Zhenjiang rice market to Wuhu. It can be said that a political figure used his political power to benefit the people of his hometown and to honor a port in his hometown. In fact, Wuhu is also suitable as a market for food transactions in terms of economic concentration and transportation hub. However, if it had not been for this Anhui authority's submission, it might not have been so easy to take away the rice market of the capital of Jiangsu Province. (Note: Before and after the establishment of the rice market, Li Hongzhang and his family acquired ownership of one-third of the urban land in the Wuhu area, about 3,000 acres, through purchase or gift. These urban lands are now divided and managed by the descendants of the Li family.)

The food-producing areas of Anhui Province are divided into the Southern Anhui region, the Jiangbei region (also known as the Chaohu region), and the Huaihe region. The food of the Huaihe region is traded and exported mainly through Bengbu. The Jiangbei region and the Southern Anhui region mainly trade in rice, followed by other grains. The food of these two regions is traded and exported mainly through Wuhu. Since the establishment of the market during the late Qing Dynasty, exports have been busy for four months from September when the Indica rice is harvested, and slow for four months until May of the following year, when it enters the lean season. The rice market temporarily closes, and miscellaneous grains become active again. From May to October, rapeseed, corn, soybeans, and other miscellaneous grains are traded continuously. Therefore, the Wuhu food market can be said to be lively all year round. During the busy season of the autumn harvest, the rice trade can reach 100,000 bags per day (each bag weighing 200 catties). The number of bags transported by sailboats and ships each month is about 300,000 at most. The annual export of rice alone has reached 2 million bags, and at least 1 million bags. The average annual export of rice is more than 1.5 million bags, and the number of miscellaneous grains is about 500,000 bags. The initial export destinations were Guangzhou, Shantou, and other places in South China. Later, various ports in North China also came to purchase rice, and Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other places also became export destinations. Therefore, those engaged in the rice business in Wuhu were initially mostly from Guangdong. Later, more people from Tianjin and Shandong provinces gradually arrived. Currently, the transportation industry in the Wuhu rice industry's five gangs is mostly from the north and south seas, Guangdong, Shandong, Hebei, and other places.

(3) Current Situation
Due to the needs of rice and grain trading and processing, the Wuhu grain industry is divided into five gangs, each engaged in its own business:
(1) Rice Hulling Industry
(2) Rice Milling Factory and Warehouse Industry
(3) Miscellaneous Grain Industry
(4) Rice Industry
(5) Transportation Industry
Among them, the rice hulling industry and the rice milling factory and warehouse industry are factory-type businesses that process rice. Rice hulling uses old-fashioned wooden rice hullers and is an outdated rice processing factory. Rice milling factories use diesel or electricity to power rice milling machines. Currently, there are about 20 of each. Because of the long distance and large transportation capacity of the north and south seas, purchasers buy rice rather than rice. This has allowed Wuhu to have these 40 or so rice hulling and rice milling factories. In addition to processing rice, these two industries also operate warehouses. Buyers of rice and miscellaneous grains need to store the rice and grain properly for transportation before it is shipped out to distant places. Therefore, the rice hulling and rice milling factories are equipped with ventilated and spacious warehouses for storing rice for transportation, which also generates a "rental" fee.
The miscellaneous grain industry and the rice industry are both seller representatives or brokers. These two industries do not require any capital equipment. They only need a brand and hire a few skilled workers to start a business, so there are many people engaged in this. There are about 300 miscellaneous grain companies and about 120 rice companies (also known as Jiangguang companies, formerly known as buying rice from the three Jiangs and selling it to the two Guangs). These two industries represent small rice merchants from various counties and towns or even farmers selling their products and charge commissions. They are completely intermediary merchants.
Finally, the transportation industry is a broker representing buyers from Tianjin, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Shantou, and other places. Like the rice industry and the miscellaneous grain industry, it is an intermediary merchant. However, many people who have been engaged in this industry for decades have accumulated a great deal of wealth. For example, the chairman of this industry, Li Nianci, has assets of about hundreds of thousands of dan of rice. He has been engaged in this industry for decades. Transportation companies representing buyers from other places must have credit and capital to operate. Otherwise, even if they set up a brand, no one from other places will entrust them with purchasing. Therefore, there are not many companies in this industry, only 70 or so. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it was more convenient to purchase rice from Burma and Vietnam in South China, and there was less demand for rice from the Yangtze River basin. North China is closer to Central China in terms of transportation, and most of its rice is supplied by Anhui Province. Therefore, the transportation industry in Wuhu has been busier in the Shandong and Tianjin gangs in the past three years, while the Guangshan gang, which was once famous, has been worse off.
The distribution areas of these five industries are concentrated along the Wei River and Qingyi River due to their reliance on water transportation of food. The rice hulling and rice milling factories and warehouses are located along the Qingyi River. The rice shops and transportation companies are located on Huasheng Street along the Yangtze River. The miscellaneous grain shops are distributed in the streets inside and outside the four gates of the old city of Wuhu and along the Qingyi River.

(4) Costs Added to Rice Entering and Leaving the Wuhu Market
The costs added to one dan of rice passing through the Wuhu food market are detailed below:
(1) Commission (income of the rice shop): 0.34 yuan
(2) Fee (income of the transportation company's grain shop): 0.83 yuan
(3) Packing fee (income of the workers): 0.07 yuan
(4) Loading and unloading labor (income of the workers): 0.25 yuan
(5) Round fee (income of the warehouse): 0.02 yuan
(6) Special self-defense donation (collected by the Anhui Provincial Government): 6 sheng of rice, valued at about 0.96 yuan
(7) Rice donation of the Rice Industry Association (income of the Five Gangs Rice Association): 0.01 yuan
(8) National tax of 12 per thousand (collected by the National Taxation Bureau): 12 per thousand, calculated at a price of 16 yuan per dan, is 0.192 yuan
(9) Business tax (collected by the county tax office): 0.3 yuan
(10) Irregular loading and unloading fees (income of workers and dock heroes): variable
Total: 2.972 yuan
The current price limit for brown rice in Wuhu is 16 yuan per dan. After adding all the necessary miscellaneous fees, it becomes 18.972 yuan. Among them, merchants, workers, and local governments each attack the other party for earning too much or not deserving it, and the interests are not reduced, resulting in the high rice prices in Wuhu and making it unaffordable for buyers in the north and south seas and other regions.
(Note: Processing fees and warehouse rent are not included in the export price of each dan of rice, so they are not counted.)

(5) Consequences
Grain shops representing buyers have already moved to Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Wuxi. Rice companies have changed their location to He County and Yuxikou Town across the Wuhu River, and Dongguan Iron Mine, where the Anhui and Jiangsu borders meet. The autumn harvest in Wuhu this year has been going on for many days. The rice and grain produced in the Jiangbei region are not sold in Wuhu, and the rice in Southern Anhui is exported through Dongguan or Dangtu County instead of Wuhu. Purchasers rarely come to Wuhu and first order from Wuxi, so the consequences are already obvious.

A Major Fire in Chengdong, Nantong: "Refugee Village" Completely Destroyed

The Beginning of New Anhui
This Newspaper Reporter Bao Baiping
—A Conversation with Chairman Xia Wei—
[This Newspaper, Hefei, 21st] When the news of Xia Wei taking over Anhui was published in the newspapers, it was a major event for the people of Anhui. In the processes of the Anti-Japanese War, victory, demobilization, and suppression of bandits, the political situation in Anhui remained unchanged for nine long years. Today, it has changed, just as the suppression of bandits is being intensified and a total war is being implemented.
On the afternoon of the 14th, the streets were full of red and green slogans. The heads of various agencies gathered outside the East Gate to welcome a new figure. Chairman Xia arrived and said to the reporter in his first sentence that he had come to faithfully serve the 30 million people of Anhui, build a new Anhui, and would talk in detail another day. At his inauguration ceremony on the 16th, he proposed two slogans: "Implement a total war and build a new Anhui!" To achieve this goal, he put forward four requirements: "Seeking peace, seeking equality, seeking wealth, and seeking education," and four work styles: "Upholding integrity, valuing ability, seeking innovation, and being practical." This is his policy for governing Anhui. He said that he would immediately formulate and implement a policy outline and implementation plan and that what was required was the cooperation and full support of 30 million compatriots.
On one occasion, Chairman Xia had a long conversation with the reporter.
Thirty years of military life and hundreds of battles have forged him into a strong and resolute soldier. At the age of 55, he does not show the signs of aging on his full face. Speaking in a Rong County dialect that is not purely Guangxi, he talked eloquently about the beautiful vision of Anhui.
First, he said in a firm tone: "Anhui is located in a strategic location and has abundant resources. Throughout history, many talented people have emerged and have glorious historical pages. After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and three years of banditry, it is full of devastation and needs to be revived. Today, during the period of suppressing bandits and implementing constitutionalism, we must step up the work of building the province!"
The reporter asked how to seek peace today, leading the topic to the "four seeks." He said painfully: "Since there has been banditry in the Jianghuai region, I have seen the people displaced and suffering, which is too tragic. If the banditry is not eliminated, everything in politics and economy will be affected. What is the same as the bandits is the bad political atmosphere. Some corrupt officials, local tyrants, and evil gentry collude with each other, endanger the local area, and exploit the people, which is even more hateful. In the future, in addition to strengthening the suppression of bandits, we must also strike against the current corrupt officials, local tyrants, and evil gentry, so that the people can be stable."
"After stability, we must seek equality, which means uniformity and fairness. Taking Hefei as an example, there are special people who take pride in not paying grain and not paying taxes, but they do not know that they have violated the law, which is absolutely not allowed. In the future, not only will the burden of suppressing bandits be required to be equal and fair, but also the benefits of social construction will be required to be shared equally. At a minimum, we must achieve public education for the young, public care for the elderly, and public medical care for the sick (this is his three-public system). This is true equality. After the Second World War, the Labor Party came to power in the United Kingdom and implemented socialism and controlled the economy, which made production increase and prices stable. This is because of public management and reasonable distribution, so the phenomenon of inequality between the rich and the poor has gradually been eliminated. At the same time, we must seek wealth. This wealth is not personal wealth, but the development of resources, the increase of production, and the improvement of the living standards of the

### Large Quantities of Copper-Nickel Coins Arrive for Remelting; Hai Liao Vessel to Continue to Japan with a Batch of Returning Japanese

[Our Dispatch] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Liao vessel, which transported back over 1,860 tons of copper-nickel coins (packed in over 23,940 wooden boxes) looted in the past from Osaka, Japan, along with over 500 tons of compensation materials loaded from Sasebo, arrived in Shanghai on Tuesday evening this week. After docking at the Zhanghuabang Railway Wharf to unload the compensation materials, it has now moved to the Huangpu Wharf to unload the copper-nickel coins. It is expected that unloading will be completed by the end of the week. The vessel will continue to Japan next Wednesday, carrying over 2,100 tons of barter goods, as well as 92 Japanese nationals returning home and 48 Japanese crew members who previously arrived in Shanghai on the Yongyuan vessel. After setting sail, the vessel will first proceed to Sasebo, and after the Japanese nationals and crew members have disembarked, it will proceed to Kobe to unload cargo, and finally to Osaka to continue loading copper-nickel coins for return to China.

Furthermore, the copper-nickel coins arriving in Shanghai will be transported to the Central Mint for remelting into gold yuan auxiliary currency.

### Central Government Approves US$80,000 in Foreign Exchange to Alleviate Shortage of Western Medicine in the City; Zhang Wei and Representatives of the Western Medicine Trade Association Return to Shanghai from Beijing

[Our Dispatch] It is learned that in order to address the shortage of essential Western medicines in the city, the authorities, after the Health Bureau Chief Zhang Wei went to Beijing to request assistance, have approved US$80,000 in foreign exchange to purchase 100,000 vials of penicillin, 10,000 vials of a special drug for lung disease, and other medicines, which is certainly good news for patients in the city. According to investigations by relevant parties, the actual stock of Western medicines in the city is not lacking. Since 1946, Western medicines worth approximately US$100 million have been imported. However, most of these medicines have been used by non-industry individuals as collateral for investments, and therefore remain stored in warehouses, unable to be distributed to pharmacies for sale.

[Another Dispatch] Health Bureau Chief Zhang Wei recently went to Beijing to request instructions from the Ministry of Health on enriching the city's medicine supply and continuing to allocate US aid funds to subsidize epidemic prevention and healthcare services. Coincidentally, Shi Zhifu and others, representatives of the New Leaf Trade Association and the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, also traveled to Beijing on the same train. They separately requested the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Health to increase import quotas for medicines or grant a one-time special quota in order to order medicines urgently needed in the city and alleviate the current medicine shortage. They jointly returned to Shanghai yesterday. It is learned that the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Health have, in principle, agreed to consider the above request, but the types and quantities of imported medicines still need to be re-examined. As for the medicines donated to China under the U.S. aid program, they will soon arrive in Shanghai and are expected to be distributed to various hospitals for collection soon.
