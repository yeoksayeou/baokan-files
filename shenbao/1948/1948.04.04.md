[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The Preparatory Committee of the National Assembly issued a notice overnight on the 3rd, stating: "In the election of the Presidium at the Fifth Preparatory Meeting on this (3rd) day, due to incomplete procedures, there were errors. The acting chairman, after consulting with the Assembly and obtaining its consent, declared the election invalid and ordered a re-election. In addition to sealing the spoiled ballots on the spot for destruction, the acting chairman determined that the Sixth Preparatory Meeting will be held at the National Assembly Hall at 9:00 AM on Monday, the 5th of this month, to re-conduct the election of the Presidium of the Assembly."

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The National Assembly will be adjourned all day on the 4th. [Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The National Assembly conducted the election of the Presidium on the 3rd. In the morning, groups were selected to nominate candidates from each unit and candidates nominated by ten-person joint signatures. The list of these names was originally scheduled to be sent to the registration desk at the Assembly Hall before 10:00 AM in order to compile and print the ballots. However, because the conveners of each unit took time and the jointly signed lists arrived successively, some still had not arrived by 4:00 PM. Therefore, the Fifth Preparatory Meeting, originally scheduled for 4:00 PM, was delayed until 5:30 PM. Chairman Mo Dehui and Secretary-General Hong Guanyou announced the results of the candidate selections from each unit and the list of candidates nominated jointly by ten people. After the ballots were distributed, the election was conducted by secret ballot. Representatives designated by the chairman served as poll workers, and one representative from each unit served as a poll watcher. At 6:30 PM, staff members distributed ballots from the front rows to the back, and as ballots were distributed, voting began, and order gradually became chaotic. Around 7:00 PM, a corner of the hall erupted in disputes because ballots had not been distributed to everyone. The order in the hall was greatly disrupted. At that time, a representative from Hunan raised a serious question, asking why He Zhonghan, who had already been nominated as a candidate, was not printed on the ballot. At the same time, those seated in the back rows also shouted loudly that they had not received ballots. It turned out that when the staff members distributed the ballots, they used each row as a unit and passed them down from the first person. In the haste, the first representative in the row, after getting their ballot, was busy voting and did not have time to distribute it to the rest. When the remaining representatives did not receive ballots, they were re-issued, resulting in duplicate ballots. At that time, the hall was extremely chaotic, and the chairman had no choice but to temporarily announce that the election was invalid and that another date would be chosen for a re-vote.

### Eight Signatory Representatives Still Not Resuming Eating

### Sino-American Bilateral Aid Agreement; Negotiations to Proceed After Bill is Approved; President Zhang Expresses Gratification for American Aid

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun, speaking with reporters on the 3rd, expressed considerable gratification that the joint committee of the US Senate and House of Representatives had passed the worldwide aid bill, including $463 million in aid to China. However, he added cautiously: "This bill still needs to be passed individually by both houses."

As for the bilateral agreement that will serve as the basis for the aid, China and the United States will conduct negotiations in Washington or Nanjing, and who will preside over them. When this work will begin depends on when the technical delegation sent by China to the United States for consultations, including Bei Zuyi, returns to report on the details of the negotiations and contacts in the United States. Only after careful study and consideration can a decision be made. However, Zhang stated that the date of return of Bei et al. is still undetermined. According to authoritative sources, both China and the United States have completed preparations for the negotiation of this bilateral agreement.

### US Aid to China Act Provisions

[Washington, DC, US News Agency, 2nd] The following is the full text of Chapter IV of the US Foreign Aid Act of 1948, concerning China:

Section 402: In view of the close economic and other relations between the United States and China, and in view of the fact that the divisions arising from the war are not limited to the borders of nations, the Congress believes that the current situation in China endangers the establishment of lasting peace, the public welfare and national interests of the United States, and the achievement of the goals of the United Nations. The Congress believes that the further development of the principles of individual liberty, freedom of association, and complete independence in China depends primarily on the continued development of a strong and democratic national government, as a basis for establishing sound economic conditions and stable international economic relations. In the large-scale markets within the United States, there are no trade barriers, which is of great advantage. The United States believes that China can produce similar advantages. The American people, being mindful of this, have declared their policy to encourage China and its people to implement sustained common efforts that will rapidly achieve peace and economic stability within China, all of which are necessary for lasting world peace and prosperity.

Furthermore, it is declared that the policy of the American people aims to encourage the efforts of the Republic of China, through aid programs based on self-help and cooperation, to maintain China's genuine independence and administrative integrity and to maintain and enhance the principles of individual liberty and free institutions within China; however, the aid intended for China must not seriously hinder the economic stability of the United States. Furthermore, it is declared that the policy of the United States is that the aid provided by the United States under this chapter should always rely on the cooperation of the Republic of China and its people to promote this program; however, the aid provided under this chapter should not be regarded as an explicit or implicit assumption that the United States has any practical responsibility for the policies, actions, or undertakings of the Republic of China, or for the circumstances that may exist in China at any time.

Section 403: The aid provided under this chapter shall be provided in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Economic Cooperation Act of 1948, which are consistent with the purposes of this chapter. The purpose of this section is not to require China to become part of a joint program attached to the European Recovery Program in order to obtain the aid stipulated under this chapter.

Section 404: (A) To achieve the objectives of this section, the President is authorized to appropriate an amount not exceeding $338 million as aid to China, which may be used within one year from the date of implementation of this act. (B) In addition, the President is authorized to appropriate an amount not exceeding $125 million as additional aid to China in the form of grants, the conditions of which may be determined by the President, without regard to the provisions of the Economic Cooperation Act of 1948, and may be used within one year from the date of implementation of this act.

Section 405: China and the United States shall sign an agreement containing guarantees undertaken by China, which, after consultation between the Secretary of State and the Economic Cooperation Administrator, are deemed necessary to achieve the purposes of this section and to improve commercial relations with China.

Section 406: Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation shall, before the appropriation is implemented under Section 404, advance an amount not exceeding $50 million to carry out the objectives of this chapter, in such manner and amount as the President may determine. The amount advanced by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation shall be deducted from the appropriation authorized under Section 404, but no interest shall be paid. The Treasury Department shall not charge interest on the amount advanced by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.

Section 407: (A) The Secretary of State, after consultation with the Administrator, is authorized to enter into an agreement with China to establish a "Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction in China," composed of two American citizens appointed by the President of the United States and three Chinese citizens appointed by the President of China. This commission, under the direction and management of the Administrator, shall formulate and implement plans for the reconstruction of rural areas in China, including necessary research and training activities, but the United States shall not be responsible for further contributions. (B) To the extent possible, up to one percent of the funds specified in Section 404(A) shall be used to achieve the objectives of Section (A) of this section. The payment of this amount may be made in US dollars or in Chinese legal tender obtained from the sale of materials, or a combination of both.

### Editorial: Cultivating the Seedlings of a New China

—Expectations for National School Teachers and Parents on Children's Day—

Today is the 17th Children's Day, a beloved holiday for all children across the country. In this bright spring season, various commemorative celebrations are being held in this city and throughout the nation. We can imagine countless innocent and lively children excitedly celebrating today, as well as many hardworking teachers finding solace in their sacred duties. Furthermore, many toiling parents, burdened by life's hardships, face the next generation with endless expectations. Throughout our entire country, if the old branches are being ruthlessly eroded by wind and frost, then countless flourishing children represent the vigorous buds and seedlings of a new China, sprouting and growing. From the tireless progress of children and young people, we gladly see a bright future for the nation and the people.

Based on this reason, today we want to offer our congratulations to all the children in the country, and we also want to extend our deepest respect and comfort to the teachers and parents who nurture and protect these countless seedlings. In today's era of high living costs, the livelihood of children is a heavy burden for every parent; public education personnel and working farmers who rely on their salaries generally find it not easy to raise and educate their children. As for the teachers of national schools, while diligently teaching other people's children, they also try hard to bear the cost of their own children's food, clothing, and schooling, and there are often cases of dropping out of school or even suffering from cold and hunger, which deserves our sympathy even more. The foundation of the country's future lies in children, so we sincerely hope that the government will pay more attention to national basic education in the future, improve the treatment of elementary school teachers, promote children's welfare work, effectively protect child labor, and gradually establish social legislation and systems to provide special subsidies for the education and upbringing of public education employees with many children.

How to effectively nurture our new Chinese seedlings, so that they can develop and grow healthily, our hope is naturally placed more on the teachers who work hard to teach children all year round, and the parents who endure hardships and burdens to raise their children. They are the gardeners to whom our country entrusts this arduous task. However, our country has always neglected the physical and mental development of children, and even now, there are still very few who are fully fulfilling the parental duties of raising and educating their children; and with the popularization and progress of elementary school education, we all know that those who have the closest contact with children's lives and who can influence and lead them the most are still their teachers. Therefore, on this Children's Day, we especially hope that national school teachers will do their best to fulfill their joyful responsibility of nurturing the future masters of China.

China's national education has indeed made a lot of progress in the past decade. In terms of system, we formulated the National School Law during the war, which complemented the implementation of county autonomy; in terms of methods, there were more experiments, research and improvements. What is strange is that recently, we have seen that the transfer and change of jobs by teachers is particularly common in national schools, and in rural elementary schools, there are even more cases of unqualified people taking over as a result. On the one hand, we often hear their voices sighing and complaining about life. Due to this frustration and injustice, the reduction in the efficiency of children's education is incalculable. We naturally demand an increase in the treatment of national teachers; at the same time, we would like to say a word to the teachers: Education work is indeed hard, but to cultivate the future masters for the country, and to receive the love and respect of the purest infants in the world, the task is sacred and the spirit is joyful. The work of nurturing new Chinese seedlings is the most immortal. May you not belittle yourselves, and you will naturally receive the respect of society. As for parents, they must also pay more attention to the physical and mental health of their children, so that the family maintains a good atmosphere, to assist school education and promote the prosperity of new Chinese seedlings.

Regarding the theories and practices that should be improved in current children's education, national school teachers have always been mindful of and sought to improve them, so we don't need to repeat them. However, under the current phenomenon of social depression, we hope that the teachers who nurture children will pay special attention to the following points:

First, provide more bright suggestions. The turmoil in today's world situation and national affairs affects people's hearts, destructive propaganda and conspiracies enter the cracks, and most young people are almost trapped in a state of confusion, losing confidence in the country and society. This unhealthy mentality must not be allowed to touch children, which is a solemn responsibility of elementary school teachers. We believe that the pure and young minds are always facing the light, as long as their admired teachers can avoid overemphasizing the dark side of society, avoid expressing subjective complaints to innocent children, and often provide positive suggestions for confidence in the future of the country, we believe that the effect of stabilizing society and changing the atmosphere is extremely great.

Secondly, we believe that future children's education must focus on the training of willpower: in recent years, the theories and methods in national education have paid the most attention to arousing "motivation" and cultivating "interest," etc. The education of moral character is also maintained in elementary schools, but we should feel that what young people lack most today is willpower, which must be cultivated at the children's stage. Habits such as enduring hardship and hard work, the spirit of hard work and accomplishment, lasting perseverance and perseverance, are especially needed for self-reliance and establishing oneself in Chinese society. Teachers should provide more stories of self-reliance, proving the truth that man can conquer nature.

Third, devote efforts to the demonstration of personal example: in the group of children whose wisdom has not yet been opened, we must of course explain, set examples and transform them, but the effect of personal example is most effective in elementary schools, because children are sincere and full of imitation. Virtues such as etiquette, cleanliness, law-abiding, and thrift are more effective than repeated instructions if they are practiced and acted upon as a personal example. Teachers who love public property and take responsibility are the most powerful example of cultivating children's public morality and sense of responsibility; maintaining genuine compassion in schools and families is the starting point for social trust and mutual assistance. In today's society of moral disappointment, the turning of good and evil in the minds of elementary school teachers is truly too great in relation to social atmosphere and the future of the country.

In addition, for the parents who raise children, their mission is also sacred, as they sacrifice personal labor and happiness to devote their efforts to the upbringing and education of their children. However, we hope that they will not be obsessed with making money to expect their successors, but should also think from the perspective of the country's future, and should reveal to their children and young generations the light of humanity, pay attention to tempering their will to assist the growth of their knowledge and abilities, and especially not ignore the exemplary role of their own words and deeds, so that they can assist teachers and achieve greater educational results.

Finally, in today's situation where the suppression of the rebellion has not yet ended, we are deeply concerned about the children in the war zones who are displaced, out of school, and without support; the number of these seedlings who have suffered ruthless destruction is quite large, and their need for relief is urgent. We would like to call on the wealthy in society to generously donate to this aspect of relief, and we sincerely hope that the government, in addition to regular national education, will do its best to plan for the accommodation and education of refugee children. Children are jointly owned by parents and the country, so the government must also assume this responsibility of protecting seedlings during the suppression of the rebellion.

### Zhang Junmai Arrives in Shanghai from Japan: Says a World War Will Not Occur Again in One or Two Years; Discusses US Aid and Believes Self-Reliance is Necessary

[Reported by this newspaper] Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the China Democratic Socialist Party, arrived in Shanghai yesterday at 1:40 PM via Northwest Airlines flight from Tokyo. When speaking to reporters about US aid, Mr. Zhang believed that as long as we are self-reliant, we don't have to worry about others not helping us; otherwise, even with foreign aid, it will not help. No matter who will be in charge of US aid to China in the future, it is not important because the use of the loan has already been stipulated. In terms of the general world situation, although a major war is unlikely to occur again in one or two years, the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is already very tense, and the mood for war preparation is very high in both the US government and the public. Regarding the current situation in our country, Mr. Zhang believes that it is already very critical and that we must make efforts in politics, military, culture, and other aspects to make us "like a country." He also said: "The current path of effort is, first, to restore peace, and second, to improve people's lives and establish a clean government. Restoring peace does not mean resuming peace talks, but achieving peace through the awareness of all parties. There are ways to fight wars and ways to make peace." When asked by reporters if he intended to run for vice president, Mr. Zhang said: "I have not considered this matter. As for supporting which vice presidential candidate, a decision can only be made after consultation with the party. The principle is to hope to move in the direction of vigor and revitalization." It is reported that Mr. Zhang left the country on December 13 last year, first went to Washington, DC, and then lectured at the University of Washington in Seattle in January this year. In March, he went to Boston, New York, and Washington, DC. In Washington, DC, he met with Marshall, Wedemeyer, and other relevant personnel.

[Taipei, Central News Agency, 3rd] The Taiwan Agricultural Inspection Group from five provinces (Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Fujian) has completed its inspection in Taiwan and issued a written statement as follows: "Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Taiwan are all important provinces in South China. The weather and geographical advantages are mostly similar, and the economic lifelines are closely related. Director Song, seeing this, specially invited the five provinces of Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Fujian to organize a Taiwan Agricultural Inspection Group to study the causes and effects of agricultural progress in Taiwan Province, the system and methods of agricultural construction, so as to learn from them and engage in improving agriculture in various provinces in South China. Since arriving in Taiwan, the group has conducted systematic inspections in various aspects, such as the agricultural promotion system, from the provincial farmers' association to the county farmers' association, to the township farmers' association, to the farmers' families, and even to the farmers, and has conducted in-depth research. We deeply feel that the various aspects of agriculture in Taiwan Province are indeed more advanced than those in various provinces in South China, and are worthy of learning from. At the same time, we hope that Taiwan Province will take this foundation as a basis and go further to lay the foundation for agricultural construction in various provinces in South China. Secondly, in addition to inspection, the mission of this group is to strengthen the ties between various provinces in South China and Taiwan Province, hoping that the excellent seeds, fertilizers, agricultural machinery, etc. of various provinces can be exchanged with each other, so that the agriculture of South China can have considerable progress. The group has now drafted measures for the exchange of excellent agricultural materials between Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Taiwan provinces, and will implement them as soon as both parties agree."

### The Mystery of the Assassination of Guo Xiaoliu, National Assembly Representative from Hanshan

[Our Hefei Express News, 1st] Three days before the National Assembly began its registration, on a dark night with lingering spring rain, Guo Xiaoliu, the National Assembly representative from Hanshan, was assassinated and killed! As of now, the murderer has not been caught, and the case remains a mystery. The Hanshan County Government is offering a reward of 20 million to apprehend the murderer and uncover the truth.

No Permanent Property, Thrifty by Nature

Guo Xiaoliu was from a family in Yuncang Town, Hanshan, with no permanent property and was thrifty by nature. After graduating from the Provincial First Normal School in his early years, he entered society to serve, and life forced him to be self-reliant. As the years flowed by, his status in society gradually rose. He held a series of positions, becoming a member of the county party headquarters, a clerk and section chief in the county government, the leader of the Zhejiang Provincial Government's Political Work Team, and a section chief in the Zhejiang Special Public Security Office. In the complex personnel relationships in the region, he became a leader, either visibly or invisibly, for some. After the victory, he leaped to become a provincial senator. Last year, he participated in the National Assembly election and won the most votes. Naturally, this was the height of his success.

Although the Environment is Bad, He Knows It is Difficult but Does Not Retreat

As a result of his superior position, local matters large and small naturally passed through his hands, and many subtle problems arose. Some were deeply grateful to him, while others inevitably harbored irreconcilable animosity. Last year, when he attended three general assemblies of the Provincial Senate, by chance he spoke with reporters about the situation in Hanshan and sighed, "The local situation in Wo is really too difficult, but I will never retreat even knowing the difficulties." He also said: Although the environment is not simple, but once he retreated everything would be over. He would continue, not to the point of being killed. He was confident that the evil forces in the area had not deteriorated to that extent. Judging from his short stature and simple appearance, it is hard to believe that he was such a resolute and courageous figure. He worked stubbornly until this unfortunate incident.

Gunshots in the Middle of the Night, Calamity Strikes

His self-confidence was indeed strong! In his actions, he never guarded against anyone assassinating him. He would go out alone at night and return home as usual. The doors of his house were open for anyone to enter and exit, and his lifestyle was no different from that of ordinary people. He almost never thought that he would be assassinated, although some friends had advised him that his actions should not be so casual. Finally, this terrible scene fell upon him. It was late on the night of March 15th, in a room on the left side of the second courtyard of the Zhang family's house on Hanshan Nanmen Main Street. As usual, many guests gathered to chat (some say they were playing 麻將), and the host was Guo Xiaoliu. Wind and rain came together, but no one knew that tonight someone would die from a single blow. It was already after 11 o'clock, and the host and guests were still in high spirits. Guo Xiaoliu walked out of the room into the courtyard and there was only the sound of a "bang," and he fell to the ground.

The Guard Retreated, the Murderer Escaped

His bodyguard, He Chengen, rushed out and saw a man wearing a blue robe and a top hat in the dim light running towards the front door. When he chased to the gate, he saw three more figures. He Chengen followed closely, but those three people turned into the county dormitory alley. The bodyguard suddenly remembered that he was unarmed. Continuing the pursuit would only put himself at a disadvantage, so he returned to his residence. At this time, Guo Xiaoliu was already in critical condition because the bullet entered from his buttocks and exited from his abdomen. The guests rushed to call a doctor for treatment, but finally died at eight o'clock the next morning. This influential figure from Hanshan ended his life in this way, at the age of only forty-three.

Suspects Apprehended, Strictly Interrogated

After the incident, the police bureau mobilized to search for the murderer. In the home of Tang Wenji, a resident of Wangjia Alley near the county dormitory alley, three major suspects, Luo Pin, Ling Changru, and Suan Yaodong, were captured. As of now, no evidence of the murderer has been found. Another person, Ling Guoying, was arrested on the 17th. At present, these people are still suspects. The Hanshan County Government is offering a reward to apprehend the murderer and is conducting a strict interrogation. The investigation is ongoing.

The Mystery of Guo Xiaoliu's Death

Guo Xiaoliu's death has been half a month. Regarding the cause of his death, according to the reporter's investigation, there are two theories: one is that he was too successful in Hanshan during his lifetime and enjoyed too much glory, which led to jealousy. The other is that he was assassinated because of the competition for the National Assembly. It is still too early to draw a conclusion. The truth will be revealed when the real murderer is apprehended. (Our Reporter, Bai Ping)

### Before the Allied Powers Sign a Peace Treaty with Japan, Japan will Restore Administrative Freedom. The System of Issuing Directives to Japan May Gradually Be Eliminated. Kennan Report Praises MacArthur's Policies

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] A Central News Agency reporter has learned from well-informed sources in Tokyo that the Japanese government may soon begin to regain its administrative freedom. The system of Allied control over Japan through the issuance of directives may therefore be gradually eliminated. According to this plan, the Japanese government will regain full freedom in certain areas to decide on policies and actions. The Allied military government departments that have been controlling administrative affairs will be abolished, and the scope of independent action will gradually expand until the Japanese government ultimately regains full control over all ordinary administration and the Japanese government essentially returns to being a fully sovereign state. In this regard, MacArthur's letter to the House Appropriations Committee on January 18 of this year, requesting that Japan be "allowed to regain freedom of action in resolving its own internal affairs and defending its own welfare, in general," is being gradually implemented. The system of directives has already been implemented in Italy. It is generally believed that after MacArthur leaves Japan for the United States, some purely domestic and peacetime tasks of the Japanese government may gradually cease to be subject to Allied control. So far, MacArthur has not indicated that he will return to the United States soon, but general indications suggest that he will leave Japan in mid-May. Other officials of the government group are also rumored to be planning to leave Japan and return home. The government group has ordered the Japanese Central Purge Committee to prepare to end its work, which is significant. The Japanese Diet's Committee to Investigate Illegal Disposal of Government Property (which is one of the most powerful political committees established under the Allied occupation) has been ordered to complete its investigation by April 20. It is rumored that the censorship of Japanese newspapers will also be abolished by the end of this month. These developments indicate that some preparations have been completed to allow certain aspects of Japanese politics to no longer be subject to Allied control. The elimination of the directive system may not mean that the Allied Powers will abandon all efforts to supervise Japan's development, but it will be a concrete step towards Japan regaining its national sovereignty before the peace treaty is signed.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd, United Press] According to well-informed sources, George Kennan, a senior policy planner who recently returned from an inspection tour of the Far East, has submitted his report to Secretary of State George Marshall. The report deeply praises MacArthur's policies in governing Japan and strongly supports MacArthur's proposed political and economic policies for Japan in the future. Well-informed sources said that Kennan's trip was primarily to personally witness the situation in the Far East, as he had never been to the region before. Although his report to Marshall outlines the policies that the United States should adopt in the Far East, it will significantly influence Marshall. Kennan expressed his strong agreement with MacArthur's view that if the Allied Powers cannot agree on the procedures for convening a peace conference with Japan, the United States must take unilateral action to establish Japan's economy to the point of self-sufficiency and resist communist infiltration. Kennan also agreed that in the face of the generally deteriorating global relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, the military value of Japan as a bulwark against communism should be considered. After a brief meeting with members of the Far East Economic Delegation led by the U.S. Army's Undersecretary Draper, Kennan also agreed with their view that further reparations from Japan should be stopped immediately and that greater efforts should be made to raise Japan's industrial level. As to the question of how far Japan's industry should be developed, it is not yet known whether Kennan agrees with extremists in the U.S. Army Department such as Draper. It is understood that Kennan advocates a more cautious approach to the issue of lifting all controls on Japan. Well-informed sources pointed out that Draper's delegation expressed their views on this issue as businessmen, while Kennan is a planner for the overall plan, so he has to take a cautious attitude for safety.

### Soviet Union Announces Withdrawal from Six Allied Control Committees, Situation in Berlin Remains Tense, New Soviet Measures Have a Demonstrative Nature

[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] Less than 48 hours after implementing stricter control over traffic between the Soviet and Western zones, the Soviet Union announced that it will no longer participate in the six committees under the Berlin Four-Power Joint Headquarters, including transportation, public welfare, property control, de-Nazification, and economy. This decision by the Soviet Union was announced at a meeting of the Four-Power Deputy Commanders in Berlin. The three Western representatives protested the Soviet Union's intention, arguing that these six committees are an integral part of the Berlin Four-Power Headquarters and cannot be abolished. The Soviet representative replied that the Soviet side does not have enough personnel to participate in these committees.

[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] The tense relations between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union in Berlin have been further aggravated by several new developments: (1) the Soviet Union's announcement that it will no longer participate in the six committees of the Berlin Four-Power Joint Headquarters; (2) the increase in Soviet troops in various border areas in the past 24 hours. At the same time, British Commander-in-Chief Robertson, U.S. Commander-in-Chief Clay, and French Commander-in-Chief Koenig have reiterated that the three powers will not withdraw from Berlin. German Social Democratic Party leader Schumacher delivered a speech to the German people, expressing his belief that the Western Allies will not withdraw from Berlin, not only to protect the German people, but also for their own reputation.

[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd] British Deputy Commander-in-Chief in Germany, Major General Brian Robertson, said that he believed the Soviet Union's traffic control rules were intended to make it impossible for the Western Allies to maintain their position in Berlin and to show the German people that the Soviet Union has more power than the Western countries, but the Western Allies are also unwilling to show weakness. We believe that the Soviet Union's decision to take these demonstrative actions at this time is also related to the Italian elections. Robertson continued that foreign newspapers have over-publicized this matter, leading people to believe that the major powers in Germany are preparing for war, but in fact, the Soviet Union's new rules only require travelers to show passes and do not prevent travelers with passes from passing through.

### American Military Police Blockade Soviet Railway Administration in Berlin, Freight Transport Still Unimpeded

[United Press, Berlin, 3rd] The U.S. military command announced today that it deployed 50 soldiers last night to temporarily blockade the Soviet Railway Administration in the American sector of Berlin. Twenty-two Soviet personnel arrived at the office at 9 AM this morning and were unable to enter. During the blockade, a U.S. officer led six soldiers and several German police officers to guard the area and inspect all pedestrians and vehicles. Observers believe that this is retaliation for the Soviet authorities' order to inspect vehicles entering and leaving Berlin.

[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd] Both Britain and the United States today transported food and other supplies needed by the British and Americans in Berlin on trains without passengers. A U.S. military train of 52 cars, under the orders of General Clay, carried 529 tons of food, gasoline, and other supplies from Brunswick to Berlin and has passed through the Soviet border checkpoint at Marienborn. A British supply train is also expected to arrive in Berlin on the 3rd. A military government spokesperson said that the British authorities have no plans to transport food to Berlin by air. The British authorities also confirmed that railway freight transport between the Western occupation zones and Berlin is as smooth as ever. The rumor circulating among Americans here that British and Americans in Berlin will implement rationing has not been confirmed.

### Montgomery Arrives in Germany, Scheduled to Go to Berlin on Tuesday

[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd] British Chief of the Imperial General Staff Field Marshal Montgomery is expected to arrive in the British zone of Germany on the 3rd and meet with British Commander-in-Chief Sir Robertson. Although the two will discuss the tense situation in Berlin, British officials have stated that this is not the purpose of the Field Marshal's visit to Germany. The Field Marshal is scheduled to go to Berlin on Tuesday.

### Royall Indicates that American Troops Will Remain in Berlin

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] U.S. Secretary of the Army Kenneth Royall said today that although the Soviet Union has recently taken actions to cut off traffic between Berlin and Western Europe, American troops will remain in Berlin. Royall told a press conference that the Army Department fully supports the non-hostile and firm policy of General Clay, the commander of the U.S. military in Germany. At the same time, Acting Secretary of State Robert Lovett said that representatives from the United Kingdom, the United States, and France will meet again next week to discuss the issue of West Germany. Lovett also pointed out that Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin only discussed the U.S. detention of Soviet ships with him today.

### President to Sign Unified Law for American Aid to Europe and China, Effective Immediately. A Temporary Agency Will Be Established to Manage It.

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] The $6.098 billion Aid to Europe and China Anti-Communist Act will be signed by President Truman this afternoon, two weeks ahead of schedule. The President will also simultaneously order the establishment of a temporary agency to manage the initial 30 days of the Aid to Europe Act implementation, after which the European Recovery Administration will take over. According to Undersecretary of State Lovett's announcement yesterday, the State Department has largely completed the deployment of the agency's organization and can begin operations on Monday.

The administrator will be appointed by Truman and then approved by the Senate. The position is at the cabinet level, and Studebaker Corporation General Manager Paul Gray Hoffman is the most highly touted candidate. In addition, President Truman will also designate a current ambassador to supervise the implementation of aid matters in various countries. Diplomatic circles speculate that the candidate will be U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas.

[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] Although appropriations must still be passed by the House Appropriations Committee after Congress passes the overall Foreign Aid Act, the Act stipulates that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation is allowed to immediately provide 1 billion yuan in advance payments for the European Recovery Program after the President approves the Act, and immediately advance 50 million yuan each for the Aid to China, Aid to Turkey, and Aid to Greece cases, so that materials can be shipped immediately. Acting Secretary of State Lovett announced on the evening of the 2nd that materials under the European Recovery Program could begin shipping next Monday.

### U.S. Secretary of Defense Submits Draft Law for Conscription and Military Training to Congress, Eisenhower Advocates Strengthening the Military to Cope with Emergencies

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] Former Army Chief of Staff Dwight Eisenhower, in full military uniform, attended the Senate Armed Services Committee today and expressed his views in a straightforward manner, advocating the immediate restoration of conscription, saying that although war is not yet imminent, manpower must still be strengthened, just as he commanded the Allied forces to conquer Europe during World War II. At the same time, Secretary of Defense Forrestal has submitted draft laws for conscription and military training to the Armed Services Committees of both houses of Congress. The draft laws stipulate that all men in the country between the ages of 18 and 45 must register, and all men between the ages of 19 and 26 who have not participated in the war must undergo two years of military training.

### News Conference Main Committee: Passage of News Freedom Act; My Representative Offers Suggestions on News Quality

[Reuters, Geneva, 3rd] The main committee of the International Conference on Freedom of Information today passed a U.S. resolution declaring that "freedom of information is a fundamental human right and a touchstone of all freedoms to which the United Nations is dedicated; without such freedom, world peace cannot be maintained." The resolution passed by a vote of 27 to 6. The Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Byelorussia, Ukraine, and Yugoslavia all voted against it.

A Soviet request for an amendment condemning fascism was rejected. A British request to remove the part of the resolution condemning monopolies was passed. An Argentine request to invite Spain to send observers was also rejected. The conference's technical committee passed a Dutch proposal prohibiting prior censorship of newspapers, radio stations, and films; and passed four British resolutions: (1) Foreign correspondents legally admitted to a country shall not be expelled for legally exercising their right to report and transmit news; (2) Governments shall not discriminate against news organizations in providing information on the basis of politics, nationality, religion, race, or individual; (3) Governments shall investigate the state of public and private monopolies in domestic news organizations; (4) Everyone shall have the right to possess, without oppression, wireless equipment to receive broadcasts of all wavelengths, both domestic and foreign.

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 2nd] The Third Committee of the United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information discussed the issue of improving news quality this afternoon.

### Italian General Election Approaches: Riots Erupt in Various Places; National Military and Police Forces Sufficient to Maintain Order

### General Chennault on U.S. Policy Toward China

(8) Lack of Broad and Deep Vision

With the help of the smart and friendly United States, China could have embarked on the path of strong, stable and self-improving after the war, even when we were fighting side by side with her against Japan.

But this opportunity slipped away between negligent and clumsy fingers. One half of Asia, the center of the world's military strategy, has finally become a place for the struggle for status and power, and since we defeated Japan, we have been retreating and the Soviet Union has been gaining the upper hand.

In 1942, or even later, China's situation was very suitable for us to make long-term investments to promote world peace and progress. The amount of investment may be small, and in any case, it will not be more than the investment that we should make even without such a good hope of return. In addition to material assistance, the investment required is nothing more than the development of a glorious relationship in terms of ideas with an ally whose inclination towards us has been very obvious.

But although this is an easier and more beneficial path, it requires considerable breadth and depth of vision to discover it and follow it, but those in our country who are promoting the policy towards China are blind.

When helping China to fight, we can use our mediation power to promote the self-improvement of the Chinese government, without trying to split her government. We can induce the Chinese armed forces to implement the necessary reforms without trying to take over their command. We can cultivate the peaceful transformation of Chinese communists without strengthening their demands and expanding their ambitions. In every aspect, we have gone the wrong way, abandoning the first method and approving the second method. Or, when we tried the first method, we also tried the second method at the same time, causing our efforts to be futile.

Since Japan began its offensive in 1937, China has become increasingly dependent on U.S. assistance. Since the Pearl Harbor incident in 1941, her hope of survival has been completely pinned on the help of the United States, and her military destiny has been merged with ours. Under such circumstances, there is our greatest opportunity.

Before Japan launched its conquest of China, although the young Republic of China had made great strides forward, there was still a force of resistance to Western ideas and government and public welfare concepts within the Kuomintang.

If our power in China is used accurately, we can reduce the power of the reactionary elements of the Kuomintang and promote the status of the more liberal elements within the party. This step is very simple in nature. There is a natural tendency in the central government to entrust its relationship with the United States to those who speak our language, whether literally or figuratively. This makes the Chinese who have studied abroad generally support the modernization and liberalization of Chinese culture. We only need to be able to use this existing advantage in our relationship with the Chinese.

But there is a prerequisite, that is, we must treat the Chinese on the basis of equality and mutual trust. If Americans treat the Chinese on the other side with suspicion and different identities, it will not work. Even if they get along well in the lower levels but lack friendliness in the higher levels, there will be no good results.

The Americans responsible for our military and diplomatic policy can usually choose a smooth road, which is to establish a beneficial and lasting American force through the liberal and progressive elements of China, from President Chiang down, but they take the path of suspicion and pretentiousness. Sometimes our official attitude, as expressed by the war zone command, is simply close to insult and open hostility—not only to liberals, but to the entire Chongqing government as well.

If, through our encouragement, the progressive elements can show that they can handle relations with the United States, then they may occupy a prominent position in the entire Kuomintang. Therefore, the central government and China will be strengthened, and it is very likely—though not necessarily—that the Chinese Communist Party may leave their Marxist leaders, and the whole country has been united before the Soviet Union can use the Chinese Communist Party as a pawn for her post-war expansion.

In any case, strengthening China by strengthening the Chinese government can restrain any major attempts by the Chinese Communist Party.

Most of this reasoning belongs to the category of "it may be so," but I believe it shows the lack of ideals in the application of our wartime aid to China policy.

### Nanjing Road Car Accident: Seven Casualties; Zhejiang Alternate Senator Killed; Da Cheng Silk Factory Car Crashes onto Sidewalk in Tragedy

[Reported by this newspaper] At 4:10 PM yesterday on the bustling Nanjing Road, a tragic accident occurred when a car crashed onto the sidewalk, resulting in seven casualties. Jin Jinbai, an alternate senator from Zhejiang Province, was crushed to death on the spot. The car involved in the accident was a blue Shunfeng brand new car with license plate number 53921, owned by Song Baolin, the owner of the Huocheng Silk Weaving Factory at 190 Anyuan Road. Before the accident, the car was borrowed by a Mr. Song Yougao to go to the Leyuan Funeral Parlor on Daxilu Road. After leaving Leyuan, the driver Yang Songyuan drove the empty car, intending to return to the factory's distribution office at 266 Beijing East Road. While passing the Lizhi Pharmacy entrance on Nanjing East Road, the road was slippery due to rain. In order to avoid a rickshaw too quickly, the car crashed onto the sidewalk, first smashing the glass display window of the Wang Xingchang Western Clothing Store. At that time, Jin Jinbai from Wenling, along with his cousin Jin Zhenduo, and his son Jin Chiheng, had just finished dining at the Xinya Restaurant and were about to go to the Grand Theater to see the Emerald Valley movie. They were all knocked to the ground. Because the car was still sliding, Jin Jinbai was dragged to the entrance of the Pinzhenzhubao Store, his forehead shaved off, the back of his head flattened, and his brains splattered everywhere, a terrible sight. He died on the spot. Jin Zhenduo and Jin Chiheng only suffered scratches on their left legs and scalps.

In addition, four passersby, Gao Jinwan, Gao Jinlan, Tang Rongqing, and Zhou Zhao'ayu, were also injured. Gao Jinwan's abdomen was cut open, and she suffered a concussion. She was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment but died due to her injuries. Gao was only twelve years old and lived at 30 Macau Road. Gao Jinlan was her older sister. Both were students. Gao Jinlan only suffered a laceration on her forehead after being hit.

According to investigations after the fact, Jin Jinbai was currently a senator of Wenling County, Zhejiang Province, and an alternate senator of the province, 49 years old. In June or July of last year, he moved his wife, one son, and two daughters to Shanghai from Wenling, living at Room 206, Meirong Apartment, 106 Minhang Road. Yesterday morning, his cousin Jin Hongda arrived in Shanghai from his hometown. Jin specially invited his cousins Jin Daichui and Jin Zhenduo, and his son Jin Chiheng, who were in Shanghai, to host a banquet at his residence to welcome Jin Hongda and purchased five movie tickets for the second show at the Grand Theater. Because it was still early, they went to Xinya for a short break. During the break, they decided to have dinner at the Huibinlou Restaurant in the evening. After leaving Xinya, Jin Hongda and Jin Yuanchui walked faster, while Jin Jinbai, Jin Zhenduo, and Jin Chiheng walked slowly side by side, not far apart. Unexpectedly, a tragedy occurred in a short time. Of the five people, one died and two were injured, while the other two were fortunately unharmed. Jin Jinbai's family has hired a lawyer and decided to file a lawsuit with the court to investigate the responsibility for the accident.

Among the injured, Tang Rongqing, from Shaoxing, was a tea servant at a certain stock exchange. He suffered a laceration on his forehead. Zhou Zhao'ayu had just arrived in Shanghai from her hometown of Wenzhou yesterday to visit her niece, who worked as a maid at Wang Xingchang. She was asking questions at the entrance when she was hit, suffering a broken left leg. The injured were sent to the hospital for treatment and are no longer in serious condition. After the accident, the Lao Zha police station meticulously measured the car's speed and proved that the car's speed at the time was only 15 yards. According to the driver, the main reason for the accident was that the road was too slippery, the swerving was too sudden, and the brakes could not be controlled. Driver Yang Songyuan was detained and attempted suicide several times, but was unsuccessful due to the close supervision of the police station.

### Prices of Chinese and Western Cuisine Set Meals to Be Adjusted Automatically Every Month; Thrift Movement Committee Passed Regulations Yesterday

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai All Circles Thrift Movement Committee held its fifth meeting at the City Hall meeting room at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the price adjustment standards for the Chinese and Western cuisine industries. The Shanghai Western Cuisine, Coffee, and Liquor Industry Association previously requested that the approved prices for frugal banquets and set meals were no longer suitable, and requested that the average price of several main ingredients such as chicken, duck, fish, shrimp for Chinese banquets, and chicken, fish, and meat for Western cuisine be used as the basis for adjusting prices for frugal banquets in the future. The price of Chinese and Western set meals should be automatically adjusted based on rice prices. The Social Affairs Bureau approved the case as follows: (1) The highest price for a Chinese banquet is 3 million yuan per table, decreasing by 200,000 yuan per level, with at least ten levels. (2) The highest price for a Chinese and Western economy set meal is 60,000 yuan per meal, decreasing by 5,000 yuan per level, with at least six levels. The case was passed by the Municipal Affairs Conference, allowing the respective associations to adjust on their own, but must follow the following adjustment standards to show restrictions: (1) The average price of five main ingredients such as chicken, duck, fish, shrimp, and pork is the adjustment standard for Chinese cuisine. (2) The average price of three main ingredients such as chicken, fish, and pork is the adjustment standard for Western cuisine. (3) Chinese and Western economy set meals are adjusted based on rice prices. At yesterday's meeting, the committee members put forward many opinions on the method of automatic adjustment of the liquor and cuisine industry, and decided that the price should be adjusted automatically once a month, and the average price of the main ingredients and rice prices such as chicken, duck, fish, shrimp, and pork in the last ten days of each month should be the adjustment standard. The Chinese and Western cuisine industries should calculate the price at the end of the month and submit it to the City Social Affairs Bureau for approval and implementation. However, if the rise and fall of the main ingredient prices and rice prices are less than one-tenth, no adjustment should be made.

### Xu Jizhuang on Trial in Hong Kong; Attacked by British Lawyer

Xi Bingxi Reported the Process to the District Court

[Reported by this newspaper] The case of Xu Jizhuang, the former Director of the Postal Remittance Bureau, who was accused of corruption, is currently on trial in the Hong Kong court. The original evidence of the relevant witnesses has been presented, and the British Royal Lawyer has launched a fierce attack on Xu. However, because there is too much evidence, it needs to be reviewed one by one. As a result, the hearing was postponed to the 15th to 18th of this month. Lawyer Xi Bingxi reported the details of the Xu case hearing to the Municipal District Court yesterday. It is reported that Xu once requested the Hong Kong court to be transferred from Stanley Prison to another prison, but it was not approved. Also, at the opening of the court on the 1st of this month, a senior official of the Postal Remittance Bureau testified that Xu had committed illegal crimes. According to the regulations of the Postal Remittance Bureau, the director has the right to approve remittances within 50 million, but those exceeding 50 million yuan must be decided by a joint meeting of the bureau. The huge remittances of Peng Bingcheng, Kong Guangxiao, etc. were all decided by Xu unilaterally, and the collusion and malpractice in between are very obvious.

### Cohabitation Leads to Suspicion, Accusation of Gold Bar Theft

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Fuchang, Assistant Manager of the Business Department of the Financial Daily, has recently been accused by Ms. Li Min, a Guangdong woman, of stealing gold bars. The case was investigated by Inspector Liang yesterday. It is reported that Wang resided at No. 83 Yong'an Lane, Sichuan Road. On December 10th last year, Li Min moved into the second floor of the house through the introduction of a friend, Miao Jianqing. Because Wang and Li often met, their relationship gradually became close. Later, Wang and Li had a falling out over trivial matters, and Ms. Li moved out on January 25th of this year, temporarily residing at the Dongya Hotel. When opening her luggage, she discovered that seven gold bars were missing, and suspected that Wang had stolen them. After several unsuccessful attempts to negotiate, she filed a complaint with the District Procuratorate. Both Wang and Li appeared in court yesterday. Wang presented evidence to the contrary, denying the theft. Inspector Liang instructed both parties to first attempt to reconcile outside of court. If reconciliation fails, the court will reopen the case for trial.

### Wusong Murder Case Solved, Five Principals and Accomplices Apprehended

[Our Newspaper's Report] On the morning of the 27th of last month, a male corpse dressed in military uniform was discovered in a riverbank near Taixing Road in Wusong Town. The principal offender, Sun Faju, was arrested the day before yesterday, along with several accomplices. The deceased was Zhou Mingsheng from Xuzhou, 42 years old, formerly employed in the artillery regiment of the 88th Division, and currently a cook in the 4th Regiment of the Air Force Anti-Aircraft Artillery. Several months ago, he met Sun Faju (32 years old from Suqian), who ran a small general store at Zhang Huabangkou on Jungong Road. Zhou deposited over 3 million yuan in cash with Sun's store to earn interest, accumulating over 10 million yuan in principal and interest. Later, due to frequent interactions, he engaged in illicit relations with Sun's wife, Ms. Zhang. Sun became aware of this and harbored resentment, leading to a desire to kill Zhou.

At the same time, two other soldiers, Zhou Naijiao and Zhu Shaoquan, coveted Zhou's wealth and, knowing that he wanted to marry a wife, conspired with Sun. Under the pretext of arranging a matchmaking, Sun and the others lured Zhou Mingsheng to a mountainside near Taixing Road at 8:00 PM on the 25th. Taking him by surprise, they struck him on the head with a club, then stabbed him seven or eight times in the head and face with a knife. Zhou died on the spot due to severe injuries. The murderers robbed him of his gold ring and other belongings, then abandoned his body in the riverbank and dispersed. Later, Zhou Mingsheng's original unit, upon discovering his tragic death, suspected Sun Faju and his wife, Ms. Zhang, and handed them over to the police station for investigation. After questioning, they confessed without hesitation. The police station also successively apprehended the accomplices Wu Genbiao, Qin Huangsi, Zhu Shaoquan, and Zhou Naijiao. Because Zhu and Zhou are both active-duty soldiers, they were returned to their unit for investigation. The remaining suspects confessed to jointly plotting to kill for money without hesitation and will be sent to the District Procuratorate for punishment.

### Renault Flew to Nanjing Yesterday Morning, Admitted to Impropriety to Our Side, Suggested a Re-Exploration

[United Press, Nanjing, 3rd] Renault admitted to a twelve-member committee of the Central Research Institute in Nanjing on the 3rd that he was guilty of "impropriety and lack of consideration" toward the Chinese organizers in the aborted exploration of Mount Jishi. The institute also obtained a public guarantee from Renault that the "Explorer" jumbo plane would not leave China until the Chinese members of the expedition team returned to Nanjing and all matters were settled. The committee also requested Renault to issue a statement stating that the Chinese team members had done their best to assist the expedition. After Renault agreed, the committee agreed to remove one of the armed guards stationed at the airport. Renault counter-proposed that once the plane was repaired, he would proceed with the exploration of Mount Jishi. Committee Chairman Sa Bendong replied that the committee could not answer until it had consulted with the team members.

[Our Newspaper's Report] After Renault's exploration plane returned from India the night before last, Renault himself took a China National Aviation Corporation flight to Beijing yesterday morning. His exploration plane is parked at Longhua Airport, guarded by airport authorities, and will not be allowed to leave China until the procedures have been completed.

Renault's exploration plane flew back to Shanghai from Ping the afternoon of the 1st. At 6:06 AM on the morning of the 2nd, it left Shanghai without notice. After being missing for thirteen hours, it returned to Shanghai at 6:30 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd. According to Renault, he suddenly discovered that his passport visa had expired while flying to Calcutta, so he turned back to Shanghai.

According to Renault's pilot, Oaf, yesterday, his departure from Shanghai this time was not sudden because he was eager to return to his country. He then said that the cancellation of the exploration was a secondary reason for the repeated failures of the plane. The main reason was that people had lost faith and no one wanted to risk their lives to board the plane, so Renault did not want to waste money unnecessarily and did not want the exploration to continue.

When asked why he left Shanghai without permission, Auden replied that he had obtained permission from the Air Traffic Control Tower of the Civil Aviation Administration when he flew out of Shanghai at two in the morning. They planned to return home via Europe because Renault did not want to make a long-distance flight over the Pacific Ocean. By taking the European route, they could land at any time, and they could also take the opportunity to go to Paris because Renault had matters to attend to there. Therefore, they flew directly to Calcutta after leaving Shanghai. Later, they discovered that their passport visa had expired in the middle of the trip, so they turned back and re-planned to return home via the Pacific Ocean.

The exploration plane suddenly left Shanghai without permission from the Civil Aviation Administration

However, according to Lin Zuxin, director of the Longhua Airport of the Civil Aviation Administration, Renault's sudden departure from Shanghai this time did not complete the necessary procedures. Therefore, after receiving a telegram from Beijing, he sent a telegram urging the plane to return to Shanghai, but did not receive a reply. In fact, the plane lost contact with the ground after taking off, and it was not known whether it was going to Calcutta. According to international civil aviation regulations, Renault's exploration plane needs to obtain permission from the Civil Aviation Administration when leaving Shanghai, but Renault only received flight permission from the control tower and took off on his own, which is illegal. The control tower is only responsible for technical issues such as weather for air travel. Moreover, when Renault came to China, he obtained a permit from the Civil Aviation Administration to fly within China. He did not return it when he suddenly left Shanghai the day before yesterday. Therefore, Renault needs to complete all the procedures before he can leave Shanghai.

After Renault returned to Shanghai, he tried to contact Director Lin by phone, but could not get through. Yesterday morning, Dinuo sent co-pilot Sari to the Aviation Station of the Civil Aviation Administration to inquire about the procedures.

Also, according to Chen Difan, director of the Shanghai office of the Central Research Institute, Renault contacted the American authorities in Nanjing yesterday morning after flying to Beijing, and then met with Sa Bendong and others in the afternoon. Renault said when he was in Shanghai that he would suggest in Beijing that the exploration should continue, with all scientific personnel being Chinese.

Washburn Expressed Disappointment at the Sudden End of the Exploration

Washburn, scientific advisor to the Mount Jishi exploration team, issued a statement yesterday regarding Renault's departure without notice and cancellation of the exploration:

"The American scientific personnel of the Mount Jishi exploration team are unaware of Renault's actions after he flew away from Beiping two days ago. Renault announced the official end of the exploration on the evening of March 30th, and told me to meet him in Shanghai the next day. When I arrived at Longhua Airport on a China National Aviation Corporation flight last night, I learned that Renault and his party had flown to Calcutta in the morning. Three hours later, I learned that he had left a message with a friend, asking me to call Dr. Sa Bendong of the Central Research Institute to inform him that he was leaving China in a hurry, which was very regrettable.

"I have not yet connected to the long-distance call to Nanjing. A reporter told me that Renault's plane returned to Shanghai thirteen hours after flying to Calcutta. After Renault returned to Shanghai, the scientific personnel of the exploration team did not meet him. Apart from the news published in the newspaper, I know nothing about the details.

"We are very disappointed by the sudden end of this exploration, which was prepared by Chinese and American scientific personnel for several months. We are very grateful for the welcome given by Chinese scientists and people. Chinese and American scientific personnel have been very harmonious on all aspects of the exploration. If Dr. Sa Bendong believes that I can assist in ending the exploration, I intend to stay here and do my best to assist."

### Revision of Private Trade Policy with Japan, Executive Yuan Has Decided on Principles

Private trade with Japan has been ongoing for many days since the private representatives went to Japan, but there are still no results. The biggest reason for this is the lack of materials in Japan, which makes it difficult to complete transactions. It is learned that the government has decided to reconsider its private trade policy with Japan and will revise it separately. The Executive Yuan convened relevant agencies such as the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Central Bank, and the Export Control Commission in Beijing on the 1st of this month to discuss this matter. The principles have been decided:

(1) Export materials that have a market in Europe and the United States should be exported to Europe and the United States for sale.

(2) The management of private trade with Japan shall be the responsibility of the Export Control Commission, and the export and import trade shall be certified by the Export Control Commission.

The revision of this policy will not affect trade with Japan, because the Export Control Commission has counted more than 280 types of materials that can be exported to Japan. The purpose of the revision is to seek more foreign exchange, because transactions with Japan are purely on an accounting basis.

### White Japonica Rice Continues to Fall by 100,000 Yuan, Actual Sales of Rice Remain Sluggish, Flour Slightly Increases, Edible Oil Remains Firm

Yesterday's grain market saw slight fluctuations in prices due to poor actual sales.

The Northern Market remained stable, and other indica rice fell by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan.

The flour market initially fell by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. After the central market, customers increased their purchases, and stores slightly replenished their stocks, which then turned upward. The closing price of "Warship" brand was 1,535,000 yuan, "Jiancheng" brand was 1,325,000 yuan, and "Red Bee" brand was 1,317,000 yuan, which was slightly higher than before by 5,000 to 15,000 yuan.

Soybean cake increased by 40,000 yuan each at "Shengji" and "Renji" because the Shantou customer increased purchases. "Hankou Zha" soybean cake fell sharply by 100,000 yuan in the initial market.

### Rice Prices Fall in Changshu

[Our Newspaper's Report, Changshu, 3rd] The food price decline here is severe, and transactions are sluggish. On the 3rd, the total transaction value was 3,300,000 yuan, milled rice was 3,050,000 yuan, wheat was 3,200,000 yuan, and "Wuyang" flour was trending downward.

[Our Newspaper's Report, Zhenjiang, 3rd] Grain prices in Zhenjiang are still looking low today, with premium rice at 3,300,000, medium rice at 3,150,000, milled rice at 3,000,000, "Red Golden Mountain" flour at 950,000, "Green Golden Mountain" at 1,300,000, and "Wuyang" cloth is weakening due to sluggish sales in northern Jiangsu.

It was still struggling at 93,000 near noon. Compared with the previous close, "Tongwu" was flat, "Jia" and "Yi" rose by 1,000 yuan, and "Bing" and "Ding" each rose by 2,000 yuan.

Foreign Stocks

Yesterday was strong due to external stimulus. Foreign firms and banks were both buying, but the supply was limited. "Yisha" opened at 1,770,000 in the morning, and the "Berlin Incident" caused a buying frenzy. The price rose to 1,900,000 before closing near noon. As a result, compared with the previous close, "Yisha", "British Union Paper Edition", and "Yifeng" each rose by 10%, and "Wheelock Marden", "Ye Guang Shipping", "Navigation", and "Steel Industry" each rose by 5%.

### Tea Prices Rise

The tea market yesterday continued to see buyers with a desire to invest heavily due to the successive liquidation of domestic and foreign inventory. The market inventory has not increased, and the supply is still limited, so transactions remain poor. Although this year's new tea will be launched soon, due to high costs, the opening price will be difficult to suppress. Therefore, those who hold the dominant position in the market do not want to easily part with the old goods and are gradually increasing prices.

### Pre-Qingming Tea Falls in Wenzhou

Wenzhou pre-Qingming Longjing tea, since it was introduced in the middle of last month, has been priced incredibly high due to the lack of supply. Yesterday, another tea merchant transported tea from the producing area to Shanghai. The quantity was large, but the quality was older and not as fresh as last time, so the opening price was also lower, shouting 350,000 yuan per catty, a decrease of about 150,000 yuan compared to the previous price.

### A Variety of Changes in Chinese Stocks, Rising and Falling Unexpectedly

Chinese stocks yesterday had great fluctuations, with the major investors deploying their skills, making the situation unpredictable. The overall trend is expected to change greatly. "Huaxin", "Zhongs", "Yonggong", "Yongye", and "Shunxu" all rose to the limit, and retail investors have been confused by the psychological warfare.

In the early morning, credit was easing, and new versions of large banknotes were issued, which improved people's sentiments. "Yongs" opened at 1,635 yuan and 1,675 yuan, and after rising from 1,640 yuan and 1,675 yuan, it fell to 1,620 yuan and 1,655 yuan. Although it rose to 1,657 yuan and 1,683 yuan, when Mr. Zheng's stock came on the market, the tide turned, and it immediately declined, falling to 1,600 yuan and 1,615 yuan. The transaction handling fee opened high at 15 yuan and 18 yuan. Subsequently, after 218 and 137 and others actively purchased, the rebound began. Near noon, the upward trend resumed. "Yonggong" and "Yongye" followed "Huaxin" and "Zhong" to the limit. The high price was 1,670 yuan and 1,705 yuan. The noon close was 1,655 yuan and 1,695 yuan. Compared with the previous close, the immediate delivery stocks of "National Goods Match", "Yonggong" each rose by 10%, "Zhabei Xinhua" "Lianan" and "Commercial Press" rose by 5%, "Huaxin", "Zhong", and "Yongye" rose to the limit, "Jinglun" slightly fell, "Qinxing" was flat, and the rest all slightly rose. The deferred delivery stocks of "Xinguang" were flat, "Yongs" and "Qinxing" slightly rose, and "Xinhe" slightly fell. The over-the-counter stocks of various unlisted companies had minor fluctuations.

### From Children's Day to Child Welfare - Written for the 37th Children's Day

— Chen Tiesheng

Today is the 17th Children's Day, and there are grand celebrations and commemorations throughout the country. This is an annual gathering, and on this day each year, many dedicated child workers and comrades in childcare services write articles expressing their hopes, ideals, or suggestions for Children's Day, and even making further appeals. However, after each grand gathering passes, it fades away with the spring breeze, and many profound and valuable opinions become merely topical articles, never fulfilling the true meaning of the founding of this grand gathering or the central task of current child rearing issues. We feel deeply ashamed of the uneventful passing of the previous sixteen Children's Days!

Everyone knows the position children occupy in the national sphere: they are the future masters, the creators of culture, and the inheritors of history. They shoulder great responsibilities for the future. But how can we enable this next generation of masters to take on such great tasks? Everyone knows that this is not a responsibility solely for comrades engaged in child welfare work; it requires all adults in the country, as well as parents and teachers, to jointly shoulder this responsibility and cultivate diligently, so that the next generation of citizens can stand strong.

Indeed, children's issues are the root of all social problems. Especially in our troubled China, not only are there issues of children's education in schools and the relief and education of poor children, but there are also irrational habits inherited from feudalism in society, such as the evils of raising child laborers, maids, and child brides. Although sixteen years have passed since the founding of Children's Day and the joint efforts of concerned people across the country, these evils have not been completely eradicated. This is not only a legal responsibility, but also a serious social problem. Furthermore, this is the responsibility of every comrade engaged in child welfare work. We should always draw the attention of society, conduct accurate investigations and statistics, assist the government in correcting customs, and widely publicize through literature and art, so that all adults in the country know that children have independent personalities, and that children do not belong to their parents. We must awaken the awareness of the whole country and make the greatest efforts to ensure that the next generation is healthy, and that our country is strong and its position is elevated.

Based on the above issues, the significance of holding Children's Day each year is not only to gather and celebrate, but to have a common goal, to summarize all children's issues, to conduct systematic research to provide comrades in child welfare work with options, and to jointly promote it with national child welfare organizations. It seems feasible to first try this in Shanghai. From today until the same day next year, we hope to have a permanent memorial produced, such as children's parks, children's sanatoriums, children's cinemas, and children's libraries. We can gather donations from comrades and, depending on financial resources and the environment, choose one to complete on a regular basis. We must not let this great and important gathering only consist of empty celebrations. We hope that comrades in children's welfare organizations throughout the city will pay more attention to this great holiday, work towards our common goals, accomplish the above tasks, and pay more attention to cultivating the next generation. If we can do so, it will not be difficult for China's child welfare cause to embark on a bright path.

### Football League A Division: Eastern vs. Qingbai Final Decisive Battle Today at 3:00 PM at Yiyuan

The two giants of the Chinese Football League A Division, Eastern and Qingbai, will decide the championship today at 3:00 PM at Yiyuan. Tickets are still sold in two types: ordinary 40,000 and special 60,000. Ordinary seats are limited to 15,000, and special seats are limited to 3,000. Presales will begin at 9:00 AM at the Municipal Stadium. The Yiyuan gate will open at 12:00 noon, and spectators must enter the venue before 2:00 PM after verifying their tickets. The referee is Wu Shouheng, and the linesmen are Chen Jixiang and He Chunhui.

In addition to the A Division, there are also the C3 group finals and two youth cup matches, which will be competed at Zhongzheng Park at 10:00 AM. The complete schedule is as follows:

Qingbai Qing vs. Eastern (A Division Final) 3:00 PM Yiyuan

Qingbai B vs. Zhongfang (Youth Cup) 10:00 AM Zhong 1

Qunli vs. Jingwu (Youth Cup) 10:00 AM Zhong 2

Yin Team vs. Xinfeng (C3 Final) 10:00 AM Zhong 3

The Eastern team is the champion of the previous League A, with strong fighting power. This year, it is even more determined to strengthen itself. In addition to all the veterans, it has recruited three knights from the south, Xie Jinhong, Chen Jiawan, and Xia Tixian, which makes it even better. The lineup for today's game was announced yesterday by Jia Youliang: Jiawan will move to the right, Jinhong will be the left defender, and Lin Gen will replace Yu Qiaoxing. There are no other changes. Xie was best at left back when he was in Hong Kong, but since coming to Shanghai, due to Sun's leg injury and Youliang's retirement, there has been a lack of talent on the front line, so Xie played as an inside forward. Now that he is back in his defensive position, he will be able to play to his full potential. Working with Chen Jiawan, he will definitely be able to "meet head on" with Qingbai's Wu Yan. Lin Gen and Sun Laorong have been away from the game for a long time due to injuries. Now that they are putting on their uniforms again, the strength of both offense and defense has been increased. The rest of the team are also first-class players, well-equipped, and very ideal.

Although Qingbai Qing was the runner-up in the last league, it defeated Eastern in the Mayor's Cup and retained the trophy. The iron gate of defender Wu Yan is well-known and does not need much introduction. Center-back Meng Yiliang is in excellent form, his marking skills are top-notch, Gao Baozheng is steady and reliable, running all over the field, not only can he defend, but he can also assist in the attack. The forwards are led by Afu, who will lead the troops and charge into battle. Goalkeeper Qin Bigao will arrive from Hong Kong this morning, so the team's lineup is also very strong. It is difficult to predict who will win this battle. The lineups of the two teams and the situation in Group A are listed below:

Eastern Team

Zhang Banglun

Xie Jinhong Chen Jiawan

Han Longbo Tan Fuzhen Zhang Linggen

Li Yao Sun Jinshun Han Longhai Xia Tixian Chen Mingzhe

(New Blood) Zhuang Youren Jia Youliang

Qingbai Team

### Children

— Chen Yanfan

Madame Chiang, president of the China Committee of the United Nations Children's Relief Fund, wrote to representatives of the National Assembly, asking them to donate one day's income to relieve the suffering of 300 million children worldwide. Madame Chiang recently received a telegram from a seven-year-old girl named Zhao Huimin in Yueyang, who remitted 100,000 yuan through the China Farmers Bank to support the movement she initiated to solicit funds for children's relief. She was deeply moved by this.

It is estimated that at least 100 million of the 300 million suffering children are in China. On the same day that the above news was published, the Tianjin Min Guo Daily had a dispatch from Kaifeng, describing three tragedies of selling children on the streets of Bianliang on the same day. It said: "Behind Xiangguo Temple Street, a woman dressed in rural clothes, with a wet headscarf and a haggard face, held a baby boy just over eight months old in her arms... With tears in her eyes, she told passersby that she wanted to sell him for five million yuan." "...In a remote and narrow timber mill street, a half-naked middle-aged man stood in the mud, asking for six million yuan as the price for selling his newborn treasure... He was Feng Jin'an, a refugee from Fengqiu. His family of five had been without food for two days, and he had to resort to this last resort." "At about 6 PM on the same afternoon, a woman on Caoshi Street was also selling her four-month-old boy, asking for six million yuan."

Although five or six million yuan is a paltry sum today, it can still sustain people in dire straits for ten days or half a month. In times of famine and upheaval, children are always the first to suffer misfortune, being sold or exchanged for food, which is "a practice that has existed since ancient times." However, the fact that such things still occur in the 20th century, when society has made so much progress in civilization, makes one feel that the world is hopeless.

Adults have never paid attention to the importance of children; even if there is a Children's Day, it is only a day for extravagant praise. If there is a disaster, relief is given to adults first. When I was in Qingdao, I met some poor children, which I can mention here. Once, while having dinner in a restaurant, two shoeshine boys came in. They told me that sometimes they had no business all day. Qingdao is not like Shanghai; there are many shoeshiners, but few people wear boots. Their shoeshine equipment—a simple small wooden box, etc.—was bought for them by American soldiers. The boy said, "It's been two years, used 50 cents in American money." They looked really pitiful. First, at the age of ten or so, they should not be supporting themselves. Second, even when business is good, they cannot eat their fill with what they earn in a day. Education is of course not something they can dream of. Let me tell you, there are many children in Qingdao who do not even have a set of shoeshine equipment, and they beg from American soldiers and respectable merchants all day long. Few people give them anything, and their lives are even worse than those two boys. Every now and then, children around the age of ten or fifteen or sixteen come to the restaurant to sell the day's newspapers and pictorials. They are students. They wear tattered clothes and have a sallow, malnourished face. I often saw this in Shenyang, and it was common in Pingjin as well. I believe there are many more children living in suffering that I have not seen. My heart is heavy, and I don't know how I can help them.

### Chinchilla

— Dan Gou

You probably don't know much about the life of this adorable little animal, the chinchilla, so I'll give you a brief introduction here. The Andes Mountains of South America, with their icy and snowy conditions, are the richest source of chinchillas. According to local natives, humans began to discover chinchillas and use their fur to make clothes as early as 1524. Over the next four hundred years, the local leather industry gradually flourished, and as a result, chinchillas were almost completely captured. It was not until 1918 that the governments of Peru, Chile, and Bolivia issued orders prohibiting the export of chinchilla fur, so the chinchilla was spared the fate of the dodo (the dodo was a giant bird native to Mauritius Island, now extinct).

Speaking of the life of the chinchilla, perhaps the most interesting thing is its family life. Because the chinchilla's family life is similar to that of humans, the chinchilla actually "proposes marriage" to the female chinchilla. If the "proposal" is successful, they live a "monogamous" family life, but the "proposal" is often rejected.

A pair of chinchillas will produce offspring one year after mating, with each litter containing about one to four young, but usually two. When the baby chinchillas are born, their eyes can open and see things. Their bodies are about the size of a human thumb, and they are extremely lively, running around and rolling on the ground like a small fluffy ball, which is very interesting. At that time, the adult chinchillas run in and out of the nest, extremely busy, taking care of their babies and the mother.

Chinchillas have a very strong reproductive capacity. In five years, a pair of chinchillas can produce as many as thirty to thirty-two pairs of offspring. What is their lifespan? They can usually live up to seven years.

Chinchillas love to eat tender seedlings, alfalfa, and hay, but they eat very little. Each pair of chinchillas eats only about three ounces a day.

According to those engaged in the chinchilla industry, the demand for chinchilla fur has increased sharply in various regions after the war, creating a situation where demand exceeds supply. Because the fur sold in the pastures is all from old, weak, and disabled chinchillas, it is not enough to meet the demand.

### The Story of Eating for Free

— Ji Mo

It is said that on a certain day in early spring when the weather was sunny, two well-dressed middle-aged gentlemen were sitting in a park outside a magnificent hotel in New York. The one sitting on the left, with a cheerful smile, said to his newly acquainted companion, "This hotel is very well-equipped, isn't it? Today, I would very much like to go to the rooftop garden of the hotel and have a delicious and exquisite meal. However, I'm very sorry to say that I don't have a penny in my pocket!"

The other person said, "That's very strange, I didn't bring any money either." After a while, he continued, "I have come up with a good idea. We are both dressed very elegantly. We might as well go to the rooftop garden, choose the most delicious dishes and fine wines on the menu, and before the waiter asks us for the bill, we can borrow a dime from him and use the coin toss method to decide who can eat for free and who has to stay there to deal with the waiter." The first person praised the idea repeatedly.

They had a very pleasant meal. The food was well-cooked, and they talked and laughed cheerfully during the meal. The dime had been borrowed and placed on the table. At this time, the first person hesitated, wanting to say something but stopping. Finally, he said, "My friend, I am very sorry to you, I have deceived you a little. When I told you in the park that I didn't have a penny on me, that was absolutely true, but please don't worry about this expense, I can send someone to my house to get it. I am very rich. I changed into a new suit this morning and forgot to put my wallet and other small items in my pocket. In fact, if you insist that I tell you the truth, I own the most valuable piece of property here."

The other person laughed loudly and said, "I think we are two of a kind, I should have known you sooner. You may not know, but I am the owner of this hotel."

### Illegitimate Child

— Mao Yi

Even now, society still looks at illegitimate children with a discriminatory eye. But why should illegitimate children be humiliated? They cannot be held responsible for their own birth.

Illegitimate children have existed since the concept of marriage came into being. Although the attitude towards them has mostly been discriminatory in various eras and regions, there have also been differences. Before the Christian era, the Athenians dealt with illegitimate children by abandoning them in the open air, letting them freeze and starve to death. The Romans had the same contempt for illegitimate children and divided them into two categories: one was the product of lust; the other was the crystallization of love. They gave them special names.

Ancient Germanic law only tolerated illegitimate children whose parents were of equal social class. Other types of illegitimate children were considered illegal.

The French people have always been romantic. In the feudal era, there was no special insult to illegitimate children. They recognized that illegitimate children had the same inheritance rights as legitimate children. Many common people produced by kings who were unfaithful outside, could also obtain titles and privileges in the future; however, there was one limitation, they could not inherit the throne, specifically, the French throne.

In Italy, as early as the sixth century, the Christian Church wanted to establish foundling homes to prevent unmarried parents from abandoning and killing infants. In the twelfth century, Pope Innocent III officially established a foundling home in Rome. Outside the foundling home was a basket. After the baby was placed inside, as long as the bell was rung, a nun would come out and take the abandoned baby away, raising him in place of the irresponsible parents. This method of accepting illegitimate children spread widely, and various parts of Italy and Spain, South America, and Portugal imitated it.

As times progress, the legal protection for illegitimate children is also increasing. However, the snobbish society still discriminates against innocent illegitimate children—this is the result of the prevailing moral concepts.

### On Loving Money

— Yi Jun

Normally, talking about loving money sounds very bad; loving money has become a synonym for baseness.

But in reality, why can't money be loved? Eating requires money, dressing requires money, living in a house requires money, traveling requires money, treating illness requires money, entertaining requires money, receiving education requires money, making friends requires money, getting married requires money, having children requires money... What doesn't require money? Where doesn't require money? Those with more money can satisfy more and higher demands in life; those with less money can only satisfy fewer and lower demands; those without money cannot even satisfy the demands of survival, and can only lament in despair. So, isn't it appropriate for people to want money?

Moreover, money itself has a beautiful appearance and is extremely convenient; a mere piece of paper can be worth thousands of gold, so it's no wonder people only fear not having enough money.

Therefore, for the sake of money, corruption, hoarding, robbery, fraud, exploitation, and miserliness become unavoidable.

If people's needs in life did not have to be satisfied with money, then what would be so lovable about money? Who would love it? Therefore, I think, wouldn't it be great if this thing called money were simply abolished in the world! Everyone would not use money; salaries and wages would be paid in kind; commercial transactions would be exchanged for goods. What would be the result? Money would be useless, and physical objects would be cumbersome and inconvenient. What would happen then? Money would no longer be loved, not to mention, even physical objects would definitely not be coveted as much as money is—this is one method.

Another method is: please have scientists invent an extremely sophisticated method to use garbage and soil as raw materials to cast currency. This currency must retain its odor, have a very high specific gravity, be inconvenient to carry, have an ugly shape, and have edges that prick the hand. Of course, it must still be carefully protected against counterfeiting; this may reduce people's interest in money, thereby saving many sins, right?

In a world where life cannot be sustained without money, if you don't follow my method, blaming people for loving money is simply tantamount to murder. Don't you agree?

### Peter the Great's Dream

— Leng Leng

It is said that one day two hundred years ago, the old Russian Peter the Great was walking in the palace when he saw sunlight streaming in from outside the window. He suddenly thought:

"With windows, sunlight and fresh air can flow in. My great empire is so cold and dark because it has no windows. I must open a window for my great empire!"

By "empire window" he meant finding an ice-free port.

So he picked up a map and studied it carefully. His eyes lingered on the western European part, shook his head, and sighed:

"If I want to find an outlet on the Baltic Sea, it's not for me now."

His ancestral line turned to the Asian part, and finally he stared fiercely at Vladivostok - this is a very good eastern outlet.

He couldn't help but laugh triumphantly.

Before he had laughed for long, a shadow came over his face. He gazed sadly at the vast Siberian prairie on the map, and another difficult question arose:

"How can we get to Vladivostok through this endless wilderness?"

He thought for a long time but could not come up with a solution. Finally, he picked up a quill pen in anger and drew a straight blue line on the map - from Moscow to Vladivostok. After finishing drawing, he murmured to himself with a slight anger:

"Let me fly to Vladivostok on this straight line in my dream!"

Years later, Peter the Great died. Officials studying the emperor's posthumous manuscripts found this map and saw this blue line. They studied it collectively for a long time, and finally came to the conclusion: the emperor must have been dreaming of realizing a route that would lead directly to Vladivostok.

"We must not let the emperor's dream be disappointed!" This was the unanimous opinion of the ministers.

So, eighty years later, this straight blue line, casually drawn on the map with a quill pen, finally became two ten thousand-mile steel rails - this is the history of the construction of the Siberian Railway.

### Xu Wenchang's Theory on Imitating Poetry

— Hong Xian

Poetry originally values novelty, and only having an original style counts as good poetry, but the world reveres imitation, resulting in fewer opportunities for the development of poetry. Occasionally, when rereading the Complete Works of Xu Wenchang, there is a passage in his preface to the poem by Ye Zisu that is devoted to the word "imitation". What he says is particularly humorous. Now I have copied it down for poets' reference:

"Some people learn to speak bird language, their sound is that of a bird, but their nature is that of a person; some birds learn to speak human language, their sound is that of a person, but their nature is that of a bird. Can this be used to determine the balance between people and birds? How is the poet of today different from this? He does not emerge from what he has obtained on his own, but steals what others have already said, saying, 'This poem is of this type, this poem is not'; 'This sentence is like this person, this sentence is not.' Although this is extremely elaborate, it is only a close imitation, and it cannot escape the bird speaking human language!"

### Little Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

Although coffee is stimulating, drinking it again and again becomes nothing.

A lamp illuminates a dark room; when there is no lamp, a candle also illuminates a dark room.

The silkworm has a belly full of classics.

Fireflies have "luminous tails."

If crows were all female, or did not have the nickname "old crow," perhaps they would not be hated, because they speak without restraint.

Thunder is the means of transportation for the gods.

### Radio Registration "Discretionary Extension"

To whom it may concern: Having read the article "Reporting Political Matters" in today's newspaper, I believe it is a good word for the world and supports the political atmosphere. The Spring and Autumn styles are cautious and respectful. I admire it immensely. The handling of wireless radio registration by this bureau is a regular business matter. This time, we were ordered to expedite matters, and originally planned to end a section by the end of March for statistical purposes. However, as of the end of last month, there are still many households in various places that have not yet registered, so we were ordered to grant a discretionary extension. As of March 31st, this bureau has accepted approximately 25,000 radio registration applications in this city (of which foreign listeners account for only 4 percent). There are still many people who continue to apply. Those who install new radios afterwards can continue to apply for registration. The circumstances and purpose of the radio registration handled by this bureau have been reported in the newspapers. I would also like to ask your column to publish this information. (The rest omitted) Sincerely, Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, April 1, 37th year.

### Seeing the Big in the Small

— Lei Hong

The fact that we in this era have set a Children's Day is probably because we especially feel that today's children are tomorrow's pillars of the country. If we pay attention to them from the foundation, of course, it will not only be a good way to save the children, but also to "save the country". However, what we should do on Children's Day is not to pick a few white, chubby, pampered children to take some photos, or to let a group of limited children who have been well cared for by their parents go to the cinema to see a movie, which is just perfunctory. We should pay attention to the general children's activity, thinking ability, character, and habits, so that they can develop from childhood to adulthood. Foreign magazines often have columns about children's small actions for parents to see the big in the small. It is not until Children's Day that we pay attention to children's various things. When the festival is approaching, we can also catch up quickly, and I will translate a few children's anecdotes to serve as a starting point.

At lunchtime, five-year-old Julie put down her spoon and said to her mother, "Mom, there's a hair in my soup."

"Shhh, child," the mother said, a little annoyed, "Mom explained, "This is a crack on the bowl."

The child picked up the spoon and stirred for a while. "Mom," she asked, chasing after her, "how can the crack move?"

The father scolded his six-year-old child for telling a big lie. "I never lied at your age," the father said angrily. The child was stunned for a while, then asked, "Dad, so how old were you when you started lying?"

A neighbor's child ran over to ask me, "Mom, is the devil a man?"

I thought, why tell her the connection between the devil and men, so I answered her, "No, the devil is worse than men, worse than who knows how much." She was still a little confused and asked, "Do you mean that the devil is a woman?"

A man watched his nephew and several other boys perform a scramble. So he called his nephew over and said, "Steve, if you can take their fortress in fifteen minutes, I'll give you 25 cents!" Three minutes later, the child ran to his uncle to report the news: the other children in the fort had surrendered.

"Here are 25 cents," the uncle said, "but how did you make them surrender so quickly?"

"I promised the enemy to divide a dime among them, and they surrendered," the child said.

### Reply to Chu Jiansou

— Shi Shufan

I received a letter from Mr. Nanqiang saying that although Qingming is near, there are still people carrying spears on Longshan, so it seems that it is not suitable for waxing exhibitions or supporting the cane. The world is so chaotic, even if Su Dongpo were resurrected in Jiuyuan, I am afraid he would not write about living in Yangxian.

The West Jiu reed grows in the spring water, the lush Longcao separates the carts and dust, the apricot flowers are red and wet with rain between soldiers, the sky is far and the cave is deep, I miss the old man!

The fields and gardens are clear and strange by the valley, I report the letter after illness, and my wrist strength is weak, the garlic and chives are bleak and yellow, and the pine is gloomy and green. I am utterly sad and cut off by the moon.

The old story of the cuckoo crowing at Biqi Temple (it is said to be the place where Zhu Yingtai studied), the fragrant soul enters the song and covers the southeast, the ancient Neptune Hall loses dreams, and countless white beards are overturned on the ground.

In the evening years, I will send a warning to the spring old woman, and there is not much space for a cloth tent to settle. Who can fulfill the former dynasty's wish for landscape? Do not bother the incense and fire to worship Dongpo.

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 14 Carefree on the Sea (118)

Zhu Zhai said, "She has good intentions. I myself have also examined my past, and I believe there are several benefits to my return: First, my parents at home can rest assured; second, I will no longer have wild fantasies and will wholeheartedly strive in my career. You should understand my intentions." Feng Sheng nodded and said, "If you can truly do this, I would be very relieved. However, I cannot believe you yet. You must succeed in your career before you return." Zhu Zhai said, "According to what you say, I cannot return for the time being?" Feng Sheng said, "Yes." Zhu Zhai said, "Why are you rejecting me?" Feng Sheng said, "To put it nicely, it's to give you a little more motivation; to put it bluntly, I don't believe you." Zhu Zhai said, "I've said all this, and you still don't believe me? Then what do you want me to do?" Feng Sheng said, "I hope you follow what Sister Yunqing said in her letter: cherish your reputation and create a future." Zhu Zhai said, "Then I need some spiritual sustenance." Feng Sheng said, "Your spirit should be placed on your career. In short, before you succeed, don't even think about coming back!" Seeing that she spoke so firmly, Zhu Zhai sighed and said, "Your temper is always like this, not flexible at all. You have to think that there is no ill will between us as husband and wife, but our personalities are a bit different. If I accommodate you in the future, and you accommodate me, there won't be any problems." Feng Sheng said, "Now is not the time to talk about that. If you can truly respect what Yunqing said in her letter, then go out and create a career. As for me, you don't have to worry. I won't remarry, and I won't burden you. You can rest assured." Zhu Zhai said, "It is impossible for me to create a career in Beiping City. I must leave Beiping. However, I am afraid there will be problems with your livelihood." Feng Sheng said, "That's okay. Even in the past two months when you haven't brought my living expenses on time, I've been doing just fine. Let me tell you, I have a job now too." Zhu Zhai didn't believe her when he heard she had a job and said, "Who hired you?" Feng Sheng said, "If you don't believe me, I can ask Miss Han in the house to come out and testify." As she spoke, she called out loudly, "Han Yu! Han Yu! Please come out!" As she spoke, Miss Han in the house had already pushed open the door and walked out gracefully.
