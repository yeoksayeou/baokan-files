### On the Eve of the National Assembly Opening, the Chairman Issues an Important Statement, the Issue of National Representatives' Election Resolved

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Chairman Chiang, in order to resolve the issue of National Assembly representatives' election, issued the following statement on the 27th: The convocation of this National Assembly carries a dual significance. Firstly, it is to exercise the powers conferred by the Constitution and complete the organization of a popularly elected government. Secondly, it is to end the one-party responsible political system, enabling all peaceful and legal political parties in the country to jointly bear political responsibility within the framework prescribed by the Constitution, guiding the nation towards a realm of democratic constitutionalism and party politics.

As Chairman of the National Government, I bear responsibility for the nation before the establishment of a popularly elected government. I am also the Director-General of the Chinese Kuomintang, bearing responsibility for the Chinese Kuomintang and the completion of constitutionalism in the National Revolution. The resolutions of the National Government Committee and the Third Plenary Session and Central Standing Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang regarding the election all adhere to the consistent policy of realizing party politics and establishing a democratic constitutional framework. I bear the responsibility to thoroughly implement and have the power to execute the resolutions of the National Government and the Party. Now, on the eve of the National Assembly opening, regarding certain elected qualifications that remain unresolved due to differing political and legal viewpoints, I am responsible for resolving them. I believe that issues among comrades of our Party should be resolved according to the general practice of elections, allowing those with a greater number of votes to be elected. As for issues between comrades of our Party and candidates from friendly parties, they should be resolved through political means. Comrades of our Party should, based on the spirit of respecting party agreements and party nominations, relinquish their elected qualifications so that candidates from friendly parties can be elected. Only in this way can the purpose of convening the National Assembly be fulfilled.

From the time when the Founding Father advocated the National Revolution to the present, more than fifty years have passed. During these fifty-plus years, revolutionary martyrs and patriotic heroes who sacrificed their lives, shed their blood, and persevered in their endeavors, aimed at implementing democratic constitutionalism. Convening the National Assembly and establishing a popularly elected government are critical milestones for democratic constitutionalism. Today, the national situation is extremely serious, with the poisonous flames of the communist bandits so rampant. Only by jointly upholding the dignity of the Constitution and establishing the foundation of democratic politics can patriotic and democratic parties in the country follow the trajectory of party politics, respect and understand each other, cooperate closely, establish a constitutional government, abide by the Constitution, and assume the responsibility of protecting people's freedoms, implementing basic national policies, and preserving national territorial sovereignty. Only then can we overcome difficulties and accomplish the mission of suppressing rebellion and building the nation. For the sake of the country, the Party, the history of the revolution, and the responsibilities of the revolution, I have ordered the General Election Office to issue the relevant representative election certificates according to the aforementioned two principles. It must be understood that elections are a means for voters to express their will, while discipline is essential for revolutionary party members. Today, based on the Party's agreements, in accordance with the Party's decisions, and adhering to the Party's promises, I exercise the final decision-making power of the Director-General as conferred by the Party Constitution to decide on the issue of whether comrades of our Party should be elected as representatives and whether they can attend the Assembly. This represents the collective will of the Chinese Kuomintang and should not contradict the original intention of formulating election laws. Whether it is meritorious or flawed, let the public judge. At this moment when the nation is beginning to implement constitutionalism, I only seek what is beneficial to the country, helpful to suppressing the rebellion, beneficial to constitutionalism, and conducive to cooperation among parties. Comrades of our Party should then uphold the traditional spirit of Kuomintang members who are willing to sacrifice everything for the revolution, and no personal interest is beyond sacrifice. I deeply hope that all comrades will understand the Party's decisions, abide by the Party's discipline, sacrifice the individual for the greater good, and assist me in resolving this protracted issue. Even if individuals cannot participate in the National Assembly due to concessions, their contributions to democratic constitutionalism and the honor they enjoy for their loyalty to the Party and love for the country will certainly not be less than those who attend the Assembly.

### Over a Thousand National Representatives Register, Preparatory Meeting to Be Held the Day After the Opening of the Assembly

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The 27th marked the tenth day of registration for National Assembly representatives. Many representatives from various regions arrived in Nanjing. By the evening, a total of 268 people had registered, bringing the cumulative total to 1,032. Wang Chonghui, Xu Yongchang, Zhu Jingnong, Fang Zhi, Xue Du　, Gu Zhenggang, Hu Shi, Zhang Boling, and others had all registered before the 27th. The registration office was quite busy, especially with reporters from various newspapers waiting for the Chairman to arrive and register, creating a tense atmosphere. However, the Chairman did not appear on the 27th and may arrive on the 28th. (News of representatives from various regions arriving in Nanjing and registering is published in the first column of the second page.)

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] With only two days left until the opening (on the 29th), the registration of representatives is unprecedentedly enthusiastic. Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee, stated that the number of registered representatives had reached over one thousand by this evening. Based on the surge in the number of registrations in recent days, the 28th is expected to be even more active. However, it is reported that there is rain in Hankou and the Northwest regions, and the weather in Nanjing is also unfavorable. Transportation for the representatives may be hindered. It is hoped that the weather will clear up on the 28th so as not to impede the journey of representatives to Nanjing and affect the number of representatives in attendance.

[Another Dispatch] The Preparatory Committee of the National Assembly held its fifth meeting at 9:00 a.m. on the 27th. After the report by Chairman Sun Ke and Secretary-General Hong Lanyou, discussions were held, and the following key issues were resolved: A. Regarding the proposal to continue holding the preparatory meeting on the afternoon of March 29, it was resolved that (1) according to Article 8 of the National Assembly Organization Law, a meeting can only be held if more than half of the representatives are present, and the legal quorum is based on the total number of elected representatives reported by the General Election Office to the National Government. (2) The preparatory meeting will be held on the morning of the day following the opening ceremony. B. Regarding the agenda for the preparatory meeting, it was resolved that the primary task of the preparatory meeting is to elect the Presidium to exercise the powers listed in Article 5 of the National Assembly Organization Law. This session of the Assembly will still refer to the agenda of the preparatory meeting of the Constitutional National Assembly, which includes: (1) Discussing the method of electing the Assembly Presidium; (2) Electing candidates for the Assembly Presidium; (3) Electing the Assembly Presidium, and a method for drawing lots to determine the seating arrangement of representatives may be included in the preparatory meeting for discussion and decision.

### Zhang Boling Discusses the Situation in Northern China

Believes a Major Battle Will Occur in May

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Zhang Boling told reporters on the 27th regarding the situation in Northern China: Since General Fu Zuoyi took charge, the military situation has improved, and the people's hearts are stable. He has great confidence in him. However, Zhang believes that based on the capabilities of the communist bandits, a major battle may unfold in May because the communist bandits will definitely take the offensive. The situation in North China is still considered stable, but increasing military strength is imperative. Next, the reporter asked about his views on the president and the presidential candidates, and whether he would participate in the vice-presidential election. Zhang said: "Some people have suggested that Mr. Hu Shi and I participate in the presidential election. I said, 'How can one sun and two foreign candles work?'" Zhang used this analogy, referring to Chairman Chiang as the "sun" and himself and Mr. Hu as "foreign candles." Competing with sunlight with candlelight is certainly impossible. After he finished speaking, everyone found his analogy humorous and laughed heartily.

### Short-Term Treasury Bills to Be Issued Next Month, The Issuance of 36-Year Short-Term Treasury Bills Ends, US Dollar Bonds Continue to Be Offered

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] According to sources from relevant departments, short-term treasury bills will begin to be issued in April. The Central Bank has made prior preparations for the technical aspects of the issuance. As for the total amount to be issued, the Executive Yuan will determine it based on actual needs and the response after issuance.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The Ministry of Finance announced that the 36-year short-term treasury bills issued by the government last year, except for the first tranche of treasury bills, which closed for subscription at the end of September last year, the second tranche of treasury bills began subscription last October and was originally scheduled to close at the end of March this year. Due to the good results since the subscription began, the Ministry of Finance has approved the termination of subscription on March 26. All treasury bills sold, i.e., the first and second tranches of treasury bills, will have the principal and interest paid on March 31 (i.e., the maturity date of the treasury bills), and will be converted into national currency based on the Shanghai-designated bank's US dollar buying rate on that day.

[Local News] The National Treasury Bureau of the National Bank is still continuing the subscription for the second tranche of 36-year US dollar bonds, which can only be paid with US dollars or US dollar deposits.

### Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee Ends, Farewell Tea Party Held in the Capital Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee legally concluded before the opening of the Constitutional National Assembly. The Committee continued the unfinished mission of the Constitutional National Assembly to promote the implementation of constitutionalism. Now that its mission has been accomplished, it has concluded as scheduled. At 4:00 p.m. on the 27th, the Committee held a farewell tea party. Chairman Sun Ke presided over the meeting in person, and Vice-Chairman Xu Fulin, Secretary-General Hong Lanyou, and more than 100 committee members attended. Sun delivered a speech, stating that the Committee was established for exactly one year, and during this year, the work of various departments was smoothly carried out, laying the foundation for today's constitutional implementation. As it comes to a conclusion, we can confidently hand over the work of constitutional implementation to the Constitutional National Assembly. He then read his written report. Xu Fulin then delivered a speech. Xu first explained that the reason why the general situation today is tending towards a dangerous situation lies in the four words "poor politics." The current situation is like landmines buried all over the ground, and everywhere is on the verge of explosion. If we do not improve, we will become a large factory for manufacturing the Communist Party. However, if we want to improve politics, we cannot shirk our responsibility. Secondly, we should continue to publicize the Constitution so that the people can understand it and abide by it. We must attack anyone who does not abide by the Constitution. Xu emphasized that the Constitution was formulated by us and promoted for implementation by us. We must work hard to make it sacred and inviolable. After Xu's speech, Hong Lanyou made a brief farewell speech. Then, some committee members proposed temporary motions: (1) Sending a telegram supporting Chairman Chiang's candidacy for President; (2) Supporting Chairman Sun Ke's candidacy for Vice President, and organizing a campaign team. They were unanimously applauded and passed.

### US Congress to Reconvene Tomorrow, Foreign Aid Bill to Be Decided

[US Information Service, Washington, 26th] Both houses of Congress began their recess on the 26th and will be able to do so on Monday　　, at which time both houses will face decisive action on foreign aid. The House's combined foreign aid bill will be completed for a vote early next week (probably Monday), depending on the number of amendments revealed at that time.

[Central　News Agency, Washington, 26th] Two Republican and Democratic senators today criticized a report submitted by the Senate committee on the aid to China bill. (According to the report, some parts criticized the administrative efficiency of the Chinese government.) Democratic Senator George said: The report　has some parts that are excessive and may be harmful to the Chinese government, and only increase　the current difficulties. George is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but he did not attend when the committee passed this report. George said he was very concerned about the report. Republican Senator Ball said: He hopes that the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Vandenberg, will make some corrections to the report when the Senate meets to discuss it. Ball　also pointed out that the report has a special color of the State Department's　policy, but this has no significant meaning. The two senators' comments may be a prelude to a fierce debate on the bill in the Senate.

### Yu Youren, Who Combines Literary and Military Prowess, His Students, Believers, and Subordinates Are All Supporters of His Election

— Yu Youren

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th Airmail]　Who doesn't know that Mr. Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, is a founding elder of the Republic of China? Who in the press doesn't know he is an avant-garde figure? Among the heads of government, Yu Youren is the one the press feels closest to. Moreover, his current position is to supervise the words and deeds of those in power, strive to eliminate the corruption of the current government, and expose the injustice in all　degrees of society; this is similar to the duty of the press, following different paths to the same goal. Perhaps, he is even ahead of the press, not only daring to speak out like the press but also "daring to act" where the press cannot!

Mr. Yu Youren has a square face with an unusually long beard, as silver as silk, fluttering on his chest. He is a kind old man, but his tall stature and powerful voice show his decisiveness and progress!

He is seventy years old this year. Apart from his childhood, he has spent twenty years studying hard, twenty years running around advocating revolution, and twenty years serving the National Government. He has been in office as President of the Control Yuan for eighteen years. He is a scholar, but during the revolution, he served as commander-in-chief of the revolutionary army several times. When he writes, his pen is his weapon. When he commands, he deploys　military forces as if playing chess. He embodies both literary and military prowess.　He truly combines both aspects.

Yu Youren was born in Sanyuan, by the Jing River in Shaanxi. However, since the age of twenty-six, when he was deemed a revolutionary party member for criticizing the current political situation in writing and threatened with arrest and execution, he left his hometown and went south to Shanghai. Now, more than forty years later, he almost considers the Jiangnan region his second hometown.

He participated in and led the National Revolution, and he also needs to see the realization of democratic constitutionalism. However, he also believes that it is not necessarily necessary for him to manage these matters. He has never said, "I want to hold an important position in the new government!" However, his students and friends from all over the country had already launched a campaign to support his candidacy for Vice President months ago. But he remained calm, carefully considering it. I remember on the 22nd of this month, a reporter visited him, hoping that he would tell me that he had decided to accept the support from all sides and decided to run for election. But he didn't. In his living room with floor-to-ceiling windows, he gazed at the lawn outside the window and said to the reporter, "I'm still considering it!" I asked again, "What are you still considering?" He said, "I'm considering whether or not to announce it." This was a humorous reply, and he stroked his beard and smiled. Mr. Yu's campaign is not self-initiated, but in the end, he does not refuse it either.

The reporter once asked Mr. Yu whether the task of the first National Assembly required amending the Constitution. He said, "The Constitution has not been implemented for long, and it should not be rashly amended. If we talk about the principles or spirit of constitutionalism, it seems that we should not have the idea of making amendments. If we discuss certain details, there are still many that need to be tested in practice. Moreover, if it is necessary to amend the Constitution, a temporary National Assembly can be convened at any time. This Assembly should really only focus on elections as its main task."

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 27th] Wei Lihuang has decided to support Yu Youren's candidacy for Vice President, and he sent leaflets and a copy of Yu's book "Memoirs of the Second World War" to various newspapers for widespread publicity.

Various campaign organizations for Mr. Yu's election are being launched and organized throughout the country. They are mostly Yu's students, believers, and subordinates. This is a considerable force, so let's wait and see!

Li Zongren Delivers a Speech, Running for Election Out of a Sense of Responsibility

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] General Li Zongren, at the invitation of the Student Union of National Chengchi University, delivered a campaign speech in the university's auditorium at 10:00 a.m. on the 27th. After the speech, he met with Professor Xu Ying and many others from the university to exchange views on the current situation. Li said that his firm decision to run for Vice President stemmed from a sense of responsibility and self-confidence. He compared himself to a modern young woman, who, when she comes of age and has the conditions for marriage, frankly seeks a rational and suitable partner and does not hesitate　 or shy like a country girl. He said that the position of Vice President is sufficient to realize his life's aspirations and is also his ideal partner because he believes that political reform should start from the center. If elected Vice President, he can assist the central government and complete the great cause of constitutionalism. He is also confident that he can assist the future president, sharing his burdens and worries. The general public in China is too indifferent to politics, and as the trend goes, the people must come out to supervise and manage political affairs. In order to promote a democratic atmosphere and out of a sense of political responsibility, he made the decision to run for election. Li also said that the purpose of running for Vice President is to seek more responsibility, not to be fond　of honor and make this decision. When Li met with Professors Xu Ying, Yang Xizhen, and Li Qingsong of National Chengchi University, he replied to Professor Wang Jingjie's inquiry, saying that the Constitution has just been formulated, and it is currently difficult to predict its advantages and disadvantages, so he does not support any amendments to the Constitution by this National Assembly. Li also reported on the military and political situation in Northeast and North China.

Cheng Qian Speaks on the Purpose of Suppressing the Rebellion, Reforming Politics, and Revitalizing the Economy

At 2:00 p.m., General Cheng Qian delivered a campaign speech at the invitation of the Righteousness Association, expressing his motivation and aspirations for running for Vice President. Cheng spoke for about an hour. He first reiterated his consistent view that the Vice President is a reserve position and should not establish his own platform or issue political views. However, he said that humans are political animals and should have feelings and ideals about national affairs. His speech was intended to express his feelings and ideals about national affairs. Cheng pointed out that the crux of today's situation lies in the armed rebellion of the communist bandits. He said that in order to achieve the goal of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation, the following three things must be done: (1) Reform politics, passively to rectify officialdom and eliminate corruption. Actively to implement the Constitution, establish a national system, guarantee the people's freedom, and protect the livelihoods of public school teachers. (2) Strive for economic revitalization, passively to eliminate the capital of powerful families and bureaucratic capital. Actively to revitalize agriculture, industry, and commerce, and implement large-scale Sino-foreign economic cooperation, and should advocate diligence and thrift as the foundation for economic revitalization. (3) Must implement peaceful diplomacy, so that China does not get involved in the vortex of world struggles, so as not to affect China's nation-building.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 26th] The communist bandits in Songbei have launched a large-scale "movement to the front line." The first batch of newly trained and equipped soldiers, about 50,000 people, has been transferred from Qiqihar to Liaoyuan for reinforcements. The bandits still adopt a consistent cruel policy, driving strong men as cannon fodder to implement "human wave tactics." Therefore, the bandit rear is extremely empty, with no second-line troops.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 27th] Escapees from Jilin talked about several technical personnel who went from Harbin to Xiaofengman on the 13th to plan the repairing of the Fengman power generation equipment for transmitting electricity to Harbin.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 27th] Military News: There are no large groups of communist bandits in or around Liaoyang City, only scattered bandits looting food. The National Army is currently cleaning up both banks of the Taizi River. Also, the elite corps of the National Army in Liaobei, cooperating with a certain cavalry unit, is conducting a powerful search towards Kaiyuan Changgang. Scattered bandits are fleeing in fear, and the bandits entrenched in Kaiyuan have been shaken and have begun to destroy the railway. In addition, the air force bombed the bandits in Siping, Changtu, and Kaiyuan on the 26th, with great force.

[Another Dispatch] The Shenyang Security and Propaganda Conference is scheduled to be held at the City Hall Square on the morning of the 28th, with 150,000 people participating. Airplanes and tanks will participate in the exercises.

### Change in the Battle Situation on the Ping-Sui Railway: Bandits Avoid Decisive Battle, Main Forces Flee Back to Western Hebei; Air Force Achieves Brilliant Victory in Southern Chahar, Eliminating Over 10,000 Bandits in One Fell Swoop

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 27th] After the National Army on the Ping-Sui Railway switched to proactive offensives, the situation suddenly changed. National Army reinforcements between Datong and Zhangjiakou have arrived at their designated areas, and strong defenses have been completed at all important strongholds. Elite National Army troops gathered near Chaigoubu have advanced to Tianzhen and Yanggao, and small groups of bandits are fleeing in disarray. The two cities are now completely under National Army control. The remaining bandits who fled eastward from Fengzhen and southward from Luowenzao are also under close National Army surveillance, and their attempts to sabotage railways and raid small strongholds or isolate large strongholds will be difficult to achieve.

[Our Zhangjiakou Dispatch, 27th] The situation on the Ping-Sui Railway is deteriorating rapidly for the bandits. They are avoiding a decisive battle, and their main forces are retreating, causing widespread demoralization. The National Army is about to launch a vigorous pursuit. At noon on the 26th, over 20,000 elite troops from the bandits' Third Column moved from Beishaoying, Huaian, and other places towards Yangyuan. On the way, they were subjected to concentrated and fierce strafing by over 30 of our Air Force planes, resulting in the deaths of over 10,000 bandits. Commander-in-Chief Fu sent a telegram to the Air Force officers and men to congratulate them on their victory, and specifically extended his congratulations for the brilliant victory achieved solely by the Air Force.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 27th] The situation in Southern Chahar and Northern Shanxi has eased. It has been confirmed that Nie Rongzhen's troops have fled back to Western Hebei from Southern Chahar. In the mountainous areas west of Laiyuan and west of Xushui on the west side of the Ping-Bao Railway, over 10,000 people have been discovered, and the National Army has strengthened its defenses. There have been minor skirmishes on the outskirts of Datong. After suffering losses and retreating from an attack on Kouquan on the 25th, a portion of the Communist bandits launched another three-pronged attack at 2:00 AM on the 27th. They retreated in disarray at dawn. There are no remaining Communist bandits entrenched between Yongjiabao west of Zhangfang and Datong. The railway has been heavily damaged. Military transport on the Ping-Zhang line remains busy. Sections of the railway between Juyongguan and Qinglongqiao, and between Xinbaoan and Xiahuayuan, were damaged on the morning of the 27th and have been repaired. The railway between Miyun and Shunyi on the Ping-Gu line was damaged in nine places, and the Railway Bureau is rushing to repair it. There was still fighting in the area between Miyun and Gubeikou on the morning of the 27th.

[Dispatch from Gui Sui, 26th] The main force of the Communist bandits in this area is south of Huaian. There is no fighting near Chaigoubu. The National Army's defenses on the outskirts of Zhangjiakou are tight, and the Communist bandits cannot launch a strong offensive. Their delusional attempt to "enter Zhangjiakou on March 29th" is doomed to failure. (2) Order has been restored in Fengzhen County, eastern Suiyuan. On the 26th, local Communist bandits approached Guancun Railway Station, 30 kilometers from Jining, and were repelled by the defending troops.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 27th] The Communist bandits' offensive on the Ping-Sui line, intended to support the bandits in Chahar and Suiyuan, has completely collapsed after the National Army's counterattack starting on the 25th. The bandits in Miyun, Huairou, and Shunyi have been routed, and the National Army is clearing the area on both sides of the railway. After emergency repairs by the Railway Bureau, passenger trains are now running to Huairou on the Ping-Shi line, and full service is expected to resume tomorrow. Furthermore, mixed trains between Ping and Zhang will continue to depart from Ping today.

[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 26th] The bandits attacking Linfen suffered a setback on the 25th, retreating a considerable distance. Over half of the bandits who invaded the power plant on the night of the 24th were wiped out, with the remainder fleeing eastward. The machinery was destroyed by artillery fire. On the night of the 25th, the bandits launched repeated fierce attacks on the northern side of the city, but were unsuccessful each time, leaving piles of corpses. The people assisted in removing the bodies. The bandits suffered heavy losses and have called in the Thirteenth Column for reinforcements.

### The National Political Council, Having Fulfilled Its Historical Mission

— Lei Zhen

The National Political Council was established based on the resolution of the Provisional National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang in March 1938 and the Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction formulated by it. Preparations began in early April of the same year, and the first session of the first National Political Council was convened in Hankou on July 5th. Counting from that time to the end of March this year (March 28th), its history spans exactly ten years. During these ten years, it was re-elected three times (divided into four sessions) and convened a total of thirteen sessions. Among them, the first to eleventh sessions were convened during the War of Resistance. Regarding the historical background and important contributions of these eleven sessions, I wrote an article entitled "The National Political Council During Extraordinary Times," which was published in installments in the Shanghai Zhengyan Daily starting on January 2, 1946. It was subsequently translated into English by the International Publishing House and published as a separate volume along with the original text. As for the evolution of the organization and the expansion of the powers of the National Political Council over the years, there is an article by Xia Jun Dao Ping entitled "The National Political Council in Seven Years," published in the Chongqing Central Daily on July 8, 1945, which is useful for reference. In addition, the Secretariat of the National Political Council has now compiled various important documents into volumes, which will be published soon to provide a complete set of materials for those who study modern political history. Therefore, I do not intend to repeat the historical facts of the National Political Council in this article.

The National Political Council's impact on our country's politics may be viewed differently by contemporaries, and their evaluations may differ. However, in the future writings of historians, the National Political Council will undoubtedly occupy an important page in our country's modern political history. I worked in the Secretariat of the National Political Council for ten years, from the beginning of its preparations to its end. Ten years is not a short period in a person's life history. I have accumulated experience and observations. Now, as the National Political Council comes to an end, I will briefly describe some of my thoughts to seek the guidance of the people of the country.

In the conclusion of my article "The National Political Council During Extraordinary Times," I once said: "Judging from the original meaning of its organization, the National Political Council is our country's highest representative body of public opinion during wartime." This sentence has two meanings: First, this representative body of public opinion belongs to wartime, so under the major premise of "military first, victory first" during wartime, the National Political Council should take "gathering wisdom and uniting the strength of the whole country" as its basic task. Second, this organization is only a "representative body of public opinion," not an institution that exercises "civil rights" during the constitutional period, so in legal terms, the government is not politically responsible to it. I personally feel that this point should be clearly recognized when discussing the National Political Council. With this understanding, we will not regard it as the Parliament of England or the Congress of the United States, and therefore we will not have excessive expectations for it. Faced with its contributions over the years, we will also give it an appropriate evaluation.

We know that from the first year of the Republic to the fifteenth year, our country was also a democratic country in name, with a parliament and several constitutions. However, in actual politics, public opinion was never expressed. At that time, except for the Kuomintang—the Chinese Revolutionary Party—the Chinese Kuomintang, none of the political parties had a theoretical basis or a clear policy. Politicians were fickle, only benefiting the warlords' separatism. This situation came to an end when the National Government unified the country. According to the Chinese Kuomintang's program for national construction, the country was supposed to transition from the period of military rule to the period of tutelage and then to the period of constitutional rule. However, when the government was vigorously implementing tutelage, the Communist Party rebelled domestically and Japan invaded from abroad, preventing the government's tutelage work from being completed smoothly, and the September 18th Incident suddenly broke out. During this period, the domestic political situation was not simple, because after the September 18th Incident, the government, with the intention of knowing itself and the enemy, had the determination to resist the enemy and the fact of actively preparing for it, but could not announce it to the people of the country. At the same time, it had to compromise with Japan in order to buy time to strengthen its war preparations. This painstaking effort was not understood by other political parties at the time. The Xi'an Incident was precisely caused by the Communist Party's exploitation of this situation. It was not until Japan launched the July 7th Incident and the overall war of resistance began that the government's painstaking efforts and actual preparations over the years could be fully revealed and understood by the people of the country. The National Political Council was also organized at this time. The National Political Council included social elites from all parties and factions and non-party figures, thus forming a great unity of national political forces. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, although there were inevitably occasional disputes in the military and political spheres due to the Communist Party's ulterior motives, the National Political Council always demonstrated a spirit of unity under the great banner of resistance. Even when the Communist Party sometimes did not attend meetings in an attempt to coerce, it never dared to declare its withdrawal outright. In the later stages of the War of Resistance, the government's various negotiations with the Communist Party and the Political Consultative Conference in early 1946 were all facilitated by the National Political Council. Although the results of these negotiations and consultations have now been completely destroyed, from the perspective of a historian, the political style shown by the National Political Council at that time—the style of strengthening unity—was far beyond the reach of the so-called democratic politics of the early Republic.

Political unity is a prerequisite for winning the War of Resistance, and the National Political Council has indeed completed its mission in this regard. Looking at it from the perspective of direct relevance to the War of Resistance, at the end of 1938, Japanese Prime Minister Konoe issued a statement of inducement and appeasement, followed by Wang Jingwei's departure from Chongqing to Hong Kong and the publication of his "glamorous telegram." That was precisely the period when Japan's political offensive reached its climax. Wang Jingwei was the Speaker of the National Political Council at that time. His defection to the enemy, as one would normally expect, would inevitably have a divisive impact on the group he led. However, in fact, the National Political Council not only did not show any signs of division due to the betrayal of a Speaker, but also demonstrated the determination of the entire nation at the general assembly held in the spring of 1939, passing the "Declaration Supporting Chairman Chiang's Rejection of Konoe's Statement." At this point, the enemy's political conspiracy suffered its last powerful blow. Subsequently, no matter how difficult the war situation was, there was no so-called issue of peace or war, allowing the entire military and civilian population to concentrate their efforts on winning the final victory, until the enemy surrendered. From this point of view, compared to the division of parliamentarians when Yuan Shikai usurped power in the early Republic, and the opposition between the northern and southern parliaments during the Constitutional Protection Movement, the National Political Council truly reflected the will of the entire nation and was worthy of being called the highest representative body of public opinion.

We only need to mention these two points to see that the National Political Council has already made a good start for our country's democratic politics and has completed its historical mission. As for suggestions and supervision of administrative reforms, promotion of the construction of the anti-Japanese base areas in Sichuan and Xikang, promotion of economic mobilization and economic construction, preparation and implementation of constitutional work, and the use of national diplomacy, etc., there are documents to prove them, so there is no need to list them one by one.

In addition, based on my personal observation, I feel that a question regarding the initial stage of democracy can also be raised here for discussion. According to the Organic Regulations of the National Political Council, the members of the council are produced in two main ways: one is by election by local representative bodies, and the other is by appointment by the central government. Due to several revisions of the Organic Regulations, the quota ratio of members produced in these two ways has increased for the former and decreased for the latter. In other words, the proportion of members elected by local areas in the total number of members in the first two sessions was smaller than the proportion in the last two sessions. That is to say, the proportion of members appointed by the central government in the total number of members in the first two sessions was larger than the proportion in the last two sessions. This evolution can also be said to have made the democratic color of the National Political Council increasingly strong, but upon further analysis, the achievements of the latter two sessions seem to be inferior to those of the former two sessions. We only need to examine the motions and inquiries of each general assembly to see a trend of being chaotic and unimportant. Under this trend, the waste of energy, time, and even paper and stationery is especially superfluous, and the adverse impact on actual politics and political style should not be ignored. If this phenomenon is said to be an inevitable and unavoidable drawback of the initial stage of democracy, as the British and Americans say, a "necessary evil," then we can leave it alone. If there is a need and a possibility to improve it, then we do not need to simply advocate high-sounding words for the way in which representatives of public opinion are produced in the future. Instead, we must give thorough consideration to the actual national conditions. At present, the various election methods stipulated in our country's constitution, except for special cases, are all carried out by universal, equal, direct, and secret ballot (Article 129 of the Constitution). This is the most democratic method, but we must also know that this most democratic election method was only adopted in 1918 in England, which has had constitutional politics for hundreds of years. In the actual election of National Assembly delegates and legislators this time in our country, how many of them can truly be used in accordance with the methods stipulated in the Electoral Law? This is something that deserves our deep reflection.

Furthermore, in terms of proposals, there are also things that deserve attention and improvement by all levels of representative bodies in the future. I have already mentioned earlier that in the latter two sessions of the National Political Council, there was a trend of being chaotic and unimportant in proposals and inquiries. This phenomenon can certainly prove that the members of the council from all over are concerned about the people's suffering and national affairs, and are actively proposing motions and speaking enthusiastically based on what they have heard and seen. There are many proposals in the political, military, diplomatic, and economic fields, and some people even have more than ten proposals each. There are many proposals and the session period is short, so they are reviewed hastily in the review committee, and then passed hastily in the general assembly. As a result, contradictions and conflicts are everywhere. This not only makes it difficult for the government to implement the proposals, but also shows that the position of the National Political Council has not been uniform. It is said that the U.S. Congress also receives more than 2,000 proposals from members every year, but only a few dozen are passed by Congress and handed over to the government for implementation. This is because the review committee has considerable power and conducts a strict review of the members' proposals. Any inappropriate proposals are unceremoniously rejected. However, our representative bodies often take into account personal feelings and are unwilling to openly oppose other people's proposals, even if they do not agree with them. As a result, they often pass them with amendments. The resolutions of the National Political Council are only suggestions to the government and do not have binding force. Although their content is somewhat chaotic or contradictory, it is not too important. However, in the future, the bills passed by the Legislative Yuan, except under certain conditions, the government must implement them. If the Legislative Yuan still inherits the customs of the National Political Council (these customs did not originate with the National Political Council, but the National Congress of the Kuomintang and the Central Committee, as well as the county councils of each province and city, all have this style), then it will greatly hinder the promotion of democratic politics. This is something we should pay special attention to. (March 28, 1948, the day the National Political Council ended).

### Cash Flowing South from Changsha, Shortage of Large Bills in the Market

Small Bills are Traded at Premium

[Our Changsha Dispatch, 27th] Due to the shortage of cash in Guangzhou, cash is flowing south from Changsha, resulting in a shortage of large bills in the market. Citizens rely on small bills of 100 yuan and 1,000 yuan for transactions, but prices are rising, often reaching millions or tens of millions. To avoid the trouble of counting, merchants are refusing to accept them, resulting in a premium phenomenon. The premium for 10 million is usually 1 million. The income of the poor is mostly in small bills, and they must pay a premium when using them. On the 26th, a rice shop was vandalized by the public for refusing to accept small bills. After the government negotiated with the Central Bank to exchange small bills, the procedures were complicated and ineffective. On the 27th, the premium had reached 1,400,000.

### The Public Enterprise Trade Union Law: The Railway Federation Requests Exemption from Promulgation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] The National Railway Workers' Union Federation recently submitted a request to the Legislative Yuan, requesting exemption from the promulgation of the Public Enterprise Trade Union Law in order to protect the rights and interests of workers. This proposal was put forward by Sun Yichang, a representative of the Jinpu Railway Union, and passed by the Railway Federation. The federation believes that public and private enterprise unions are both labor organizations, with the common goals of increasing workers' knowledge and skills, improving working conditions, and assisting the government in implementing national defense production, transportation, and other policies. Their missions are identical. If the same labor class is subject to two different laws, it would be inconsistent with national policy and may violate legislative principles. Liu Songshan, Chairman of the Federation, has expressed his views on this matter to the Legislative Yuan, requesting exemption from the promulgation.

### Retired Military Officers in Chongqing Request Payment of the First Half of This Year's Pension

[Our Correspondent in Chongqing, 27th] The Ministry of National Defense stipulates that the salaries of retired military officers are paid at one-half of the current salaries of active military officers in February and August each year. Retired military officers in Chongqing, upon hearing that the first half of this year's pension could not be distributed as scheduled, gathered more than 300 people on the 20th and went to the Ba County Regiment Management Area, requesting to borrow 20,000 shi of millet or 1 shi of rice, otherwise they would expand the petition. Director Zhu Shaoliang sent officials to stop them to prevent incidents, and urgently telegraphed Guo Chan, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Service Headquarters, hoping that he could remit a sum of money for emergency relief. Our reporter learned that Guo Chan had sent a letter to Zhu Shaoliang from Nanjing on the 19th, stating that the delay in the retired pension was due to the funds not being received. The total amount to be distributed by the end of March was over 1.2 trillion, but the government budget was only 26 billion. Guo personally appealed to President Zhang Qun, who approved 1 trillion.

### A Horrifying Murder Case Occurred in Beiping: Six Men and Women Were Strangulated

At noon on the 26th, Kong's daughter Hui Fang visited the Kong family and found that five people, including the master and servants, had been strangled to death in various rooms, with white cloths stuffed in their mouths. Valuable ornaments and property were not touched. Jie Jinzhen had a friend, Mrs. Bai, who often played mahjong at her house. On that day, the chauffeur went to pick her up as usual but could not find her. She was also strangled to death in the outer courtyard's living room. The police were immediately notified. Kong had a concubine, Hao Shufang, who lived nearby, who often argued with Jie, and had deep resentment. She has been taken into custody. The security authorities have offered a reward of 50 million for the case, and set a deadline of ten days for solving the case. It is reported that although Jie was nearly forty years old, she dressed fashionably and had a wide circle of friends. During the examination, it was found that the words "Love Me" were tattooed on her left arm. The authorities are studying this clue.

### The Beijing High Court Ruled on the Election Lawsuit: Defendants Gu Zhenggang and Zhang Lisheng Appeared in Court. The Original Lawsuit Was Rejected After the First Instance Concluded

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 27th] The Capital High Court underwent its first test after the implementation of the Constitution on the 27th, applying procedural regulations to dismiss lawsuits against officials responsible for nominating elected National Assembly representatives from party nominations and election affairs agencies, confirming the judiciary's non-intervention stance on the principle of party concessions. At 9 AM, Chief Judge Zheng Liee of the First Civil Division, along with judges Xiao Subin and Yang Yutian, took the stand. The plaintiffs Qiu Yingguang and Fu Xiaofeng, lawyers Lan Zaihang and Zhao Hui, the second defendant, Gu Zhenggang, the representative of the National Vocational and Women's Organizations Election Office, and Zhang Lisheng, the representative of the Election Headquarters, appeared in court for questioning. The first defendants, Li Shiping and Wei Qiongying, did not appear in court.

Basis of the Lawsuit

First, the plaintiff's lawyer Ye Zaihang stated that the plaintiff was based on the second half of Article 39 of the Group Representative Election and Recall Law, confirming that the number of votes obtained by the elected person was untrue, and that the number of votes obtained by the plaintiff was miscalculated, requesting that the election of the defendant be invalidated, and that all litigation costs be borne by the plaintiff, with the plaintiff receiving the election certificate and attending the National Assembly. Gu Zhenggang and Zhang Lisheng then stated their request to reject Ye's application, and wished the court to handle it according to law. The court then questioned the plaintiffs and defendants in turn. Qiu Yingguang stated that he obtained 6,742 votes, while the defendant Li Shiping (Youth Party) only obtained over 1,000 votes. However, in the list announced by the Vocational and Women's Organizations Election Office, he was relegated to the substitute position with the annotation "originally elected party concession." Fu Xiaofeng stated that he obtained 5,041 votes, while the defendant Wei Qiongying (Democratic Socialist Party) only obtained 152 votes, and the concession was not agreed upon by him. Both emphasized that the election was entrusted to them by the voters, and that neither political parties nor individuals could privately transfer it. The court focused on whether the number of votes was untrue and whether the calculation was incorrect.

Opinions of Gu and Zhang

Gu Zhenggang also stated that there were absolutely no errors in the number of votes. The reason for announcing the person with more votes as the substitute was explained in the announcement of the list on March 6: The National Vocational and Women's Organizations Election Office had completed the statistics of various election results and had legally determined the order of elected persons and substitutes. Later, it received the telegram from the Election Headquarters with the number 1770, regarding the list of party concessions that had been filed with the National Government, instructing to comply and issue certificates quickly, so it complied and amended the announcement. Zhang Lisheng pointed out that the principle of party concessions was a decision made by the Kuomintang in consultation with other parties. After the Kuomintang sent the letter and list to the Election Headquarters, the Headquarters could not accept the opinions of the political parties and reported to the National Government for approval before proceeding. He stated that he was afraid that the plaintiff was a member of the Kuomintang, in which case, his party could restrain him.

Four Points of Debate

At this point, Qiu Yingguang stated that he used to be a member of the Kuomintang, but he did not re-register this time and no longer had party membership. Fu Xiaofeng also stated that he used to be a member of the Three People's Principles Youth League, but he did not join the party after the party and league merged and had no party membership. Lawyer Ye Zaihang then stood up to argue four points for the plaintiff: (1) The Election Office's announcement of the list of elected persons is based on legal grounds, and party concessions have no legal basis and cannot use party agreements to violate the Constitution and destroy the law. (2) The defendant should bear administrative responsibility for executing orders that he knew were illegal and cannot shirk responsibility. (3) People are equal under the law, and even if the plaintiff concedes, he must agree voluntarily. (4) The plaintiff is not a party member and should not be bound. He believed that whether the number of votes was untrue or the calculation was incorrect was an internal reason. From an external perspective, if there was no problem with the number of votes, then other reasons hindered civil rights, which was unreasonable. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit based on Article 39 of the National Assembly Election and Recall Law. Lawyer Zhao Hui appealed to the court to cherish democratic constitutionalism and maintain national justice based on Article 139 of the Constitution, which stipulates that candidates should compete openly and equally, and Article 28 of the National Assembly Election and Recall Law, which stipulates that those with more votes should be elected. The plaintiff Fu Xiaofeng also expressed his willingness to see the government abide by the law, the law be fair, and the court be responsible at the beginning of the implementation of the Constitution. The defendant Gu Zhenggang insisted that there was absolutely no error in the number of votes. Whether the plaintiff was a party member should be asked to the Kuomintang. He personally would never shirk responsibility and would serve entirely according to the law. He believed that party concessions were a political necessity. Zhang Lisheng reiterated his request to the court to handle the case according to law. He, as a national official, would abide by the law and fulfill his duties and would set an example.

Reasons for Rejection

At this point, the presiding judge announced the end of the debate. After the judges' meeting, at 10 AM, the verdict was announced in court: "The plaintiff's lawsuit is rejected, and the litigation costs are borne by the plaintiff." The presiding judge explained that the reason for the judgment was that the plaintiff's lawsuit had no legal basis. According to Article 39 of the National Assembly Election and Recall Law, only three points can be used as the basis for a lawsuit: (1) The elected person is not qualified; (2) The number of votes obtained by the elected person is untrue; (3) The calculation of the number of votes obtained by the plaintiff is incorrect. This case has no corresponding points, so it is rejected. This election dispute, which caused considerable commotion, came to an end.

### Attempting to Cause Trouble During the Election Period: The Italian Communist Party Organizes Strike Teams; Mr. Sforza Receives the American Ambassador for a Long Talk

[United Press, Rome, 26th] According to Italian government sources: After losing public support and becoming alarmed, the leaders of the Italian Communist Party have ordered party members across the country to take more resolute actions by any means necessary, including the use of force when necessary. The government also stated that the Communist Party has established a "strike team" headquarters near Milan, waiting for special orders from the Rome Communist Party to launch an offensive in the election campaign. It is also reported that the Communist Party has organized "action teams" throughout northern Italy. The current task of this organization is to attack reactionary political groups. As a result of this and other developments, well-informed sources stated that Italian Deputy Prime Minister Bassiatti will convene a meeting of the Public Security Committee of the Cabinet early next week to study security measures to be taken across the country.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 27th] U.S. Ambassador to Italy Mr. Dunn consulted with Italian Foreign Minister Sforza on the latest international political developments on the 27th for more than an hour.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 27th] Italian National Assembly member Mr. Wu Xifo proposed on the 27th that there should no longer be Communists in the Italian government. He called on all democratic parties to issue a formal declaration before the election not to cooperate with the Communist Party again. Mr. Wu Xifo stated that he will formally issue this declaration.

[United Press, Rome, 26th] Prime Minister Gasperi declared today: Although there are sporadic disturbances in various parts of Italy, general elections will still be held as scheduled. The Communist Party is spreading rumors that small-scale strikes and conflicts in various places may cause the postponement of the parliamentary elections on April 18. Mr. Gasperi's remarks are his response to this. At the same time, the Milan Grand Plaza has become a shouting match venue for Communist demonstrations for four days.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 26th] As the election date approaches, the campaign activities of various parties here are also becoming increasingly heated. The situation of each party is summarized as follows: Today, the campaign goal of each party is none other than Trieste. All parties unanimously agree that the port must be returned to Italy. However, there are many different opinions and disagreements on the actual implementation methods of achieving this goal. They are currently divided into two major factions. One faction welcomes the suggestions of the three powers of France, Britain, and the United States, believing that only the three Western powers that participated in signing the peace treaty can solve this problem. The other faction is the "Democratic Front" jointly organized by the Communist Party and the Socialist Party. They believe that the decision of the three powers regarding Trieste is only an "election trick" or even a provocative act. Only through direct agreements with Yugoslavia can the problem of protecting the peace of the Adriatic Sea be solved. The decisions of the three powers regarding Trieste have caused conflicts in various Italian cities. The worst case is Milan. The situation in Milan is quite tense, and the police are heavily guarded. As of yesterday, no major incidents have occurred.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 26th] Italian Communist leader Togliatti wrote in "Unity News" this morning that the decision of the Western European powers regarding Trieste is only a deception by the United States, intending to make Italy fall into the Western group's net and fill the artillery holes in another world war. After the April 18 election, servants who are willing to serve foreign imperialism will be expelled from the government, and the Trieste issue will be resolved to everyone's satisfaction within 48 hours.

### Yugoslavia's Willingness to Resolve the Trieste Issue Amicably; Tito Expresses to Italian Leftists

[Reuters, Belgrade, 26th] Yugoslav Prime Minister Marshal Tito recently expressed his long-awaited opinion on the Trieste issue, believing that the suggestions of Britain, the United States, and France to return Trieste to Italy are measures taken for the Italian election, intended to prevent Italian democrats from forming a solid front to protect their freedom, and to prevent democrats from expelling those who went to Italy uninvited from Italy. Tito addressed many Italian cultural workers and representatives of agricultural and industrial workers who went to Istria to celebrate Easter and then traveled to Yugoslavia. Tito asked them to tell the Italian people that Yugoslavia has always been willing to resolve all problems between Italy and Yugoslavia that could prevent the peaceful and normal development of the two countries and harm the friendly cooperation between the two peoples in a friendly manner.

Tito also told them: "I hope that after you come to Belgrade, you can find that the Italian and Yugoslav people are friends, not enemies. The new Yugoslavia has proven that it is willing to make peace with all its neighbors, including the great Italian people. In the current situation, all democrats need to unite and fight against the propaganda operations launched by war merchants to alienate domestic and international relations. You can know the value of so-called reports that Yugoslavia is stationing troops on the border, preparing to enter Trieste, and that Yugoslavia has rocket launch bases on the border, preparing to launch attacks on Italy. This is just a pre-election trick to incite Italian hatred towards Yugoslavia. Deceiving the Italian People's Front during the election. The great Italian people should wake up, expose these tricks, and reject the plots of those who were not invited to go to Italy."

### The Soviet Union Has Not Expressed Its Attitude Towards the Trieste Suggestion

[Reuters, London, 27th] A spokesman for the British Foreign Office revealed that the Soviet Foreign Ministry has replied to the governments of Britain, the United States, and France, acknowledging that they have received the suggestion of the three powers regarding Trieste, but has not stated the Soviet government's attitude towards this suggestion. According to well-informed sources, the Soviet Union should avoid expressing its position on this matter before the general election in Italy.

### Italian People in Trieste Plan to Request British and American Troops to Continue Stationing

[Central News Agency, Trieste, 26th] Italians have launched a campaign to urge the Soviet Union to agree with the suggestion of the Western Allies to return Trieste to Italy, and hope that the American and British troops in Trieste will be stationed indefinitely. Italians believe that the continued stationing of the 20,000 American and British troops in Trieste is better than several poorly equipped Italian troops in green uniforms in preventing possible riots launched by Yugoslavs. This movement is seen in the "Voice of Freedom" newspaper. In the open letter from Italian Brigadier General Ellery, commander of the Allied occupation forces in Trieste, the Italian people seem to believe that the Italian army will show good combat spirit if called upon to defend Trieste, but believe that the stationing of American and British troops is better. Allied officials expressed sympathy for Italy's position, but expressed doubts as to whether Britain and the United States will grant their request to continue stationing troops in Trieste if Trieste is returned to Italy.

### Finland Convenes Cabinet Meeting

Discussing the Report of the Soviet Delegation

[Reuters, Helsinki, 26th] The Finnish Cabinet, urgently convened by Finnish President Paasikivi, met today to discuss the report of the Finnish delegation to the Soviet Union, regarding the negotiations on the Finnish-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty.

### US Policy Change toward Spain

[United Press, Washington, 27th] U.S. pressure for Spanish leader Franco to hold free elections and reform domestic politics has eased, fearing such reforms would help Spain's communists. The United States intends to request nominal reforms in Spain so that Spain can join the Marshall Plan, and the United States and Western European countries will not lose face. But even this small request has been rejected by Franco. The change in U.S. policy toward Spain has been brewing for months, with one congressman defending Franco earlier this week, saying that Franco has been anti-communist for years, and that since his goals are in line with the Marshall Plan, he should be allowed to join.

### Benes Scheduled for Public Address Early Next Month

[Reuters, Prague, 26th] President Benes is scheduled to deliver his first public speech since the coup at Charles University in Prague on April 7, during the celebration of the 600th anniversary of the university.

[Reuters, Prague, 26th] The Czech National Assembly recently passed a bill to restore the People's Court and the regulations for punishing Czech traitors. According to Justice Minister Saabeka, the prosecutor has submitted 120,000 cases of Czech traitors to the People's Court, but only one-seventh of them have been convicted and sentenced, which has caused strong dissatisfaction among outsiders.

### French People's Unity Movement Attracts the Proletariat to Join the Front to Counter the Actions of the Communist Party Committee

[Reuters, Paris, 26th] Beaumel, Assistant Secretary of the French People's Unity Movement of General de Gaulle, announced the new workers' groups established by the movement across the country. Registered members are close to 150,000. Seven or eight groups have been established in one district of Paris, with a total of 50,000 workers, technicians, and experts participating. These groups will be used to counter the Communist Party Defense Committee in French industry, which is equivalent to the Communist Party's Action Committee. These groups include railway, postal, and telecommunications personnel. In the event of an emergency, these personnel can ensure that public utilities are not affected. Baumel also stated that these groups are not trade unions, nor are they secret actions, and they are not organized to oppose the National Confederation of Labor. Participants in the groups are free to join any trade union. Baumel also revealed that the People's Unity Movement plans to expand its propaganda on May Day to attract the proletariat to join its front.

### US and British Reply to Soviet Protest: Blame Soviets for Violating Potsdam Agreement; Soviet Responsibility for East-West Division of Germany

[United Press, Washington, 26th] The United States yesterday submitted a note to the Soviet Union rejecting its protest that the US, British, and French discussion of West German economic merger at the London Conference a month ago constituted a violation of the Potsdam Agreement, and condemning the Soviet Union for re-establishing concentration camps in eastern Germany and detaining those who oppose tyranny. At the same time, the British government also submitted a similar note to the Soviet Union yesterday.

The US note was signed by Deputy Undersecretary of State Armour and delivered to Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin. It was released by the State Department tonight, stating that the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites are responsible for the division of Germany and Europe into East and West. As early as September 1946, US Secretary of State Byrnes formally offered the Soviet Union the opportunity to participate in the economic merger of the German occupation zones. The Soviet Union should not have refused; it should bear the consequences. In eastern Germany, the Soviet Union forcibly merged the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, and this new party has become a new bulwark of the East German autocratic government. Other political parties are also suppressed, discriminated against, and intimidated, preventing them from freely exercising their functions.

### US Plans Aid to Asian Nations

Revealed by Former Indian Ambassador to the US, Ali

[United Press, Washington, 26th] Former Indian Ambassador to the United States, Ali, announced on the 26th that US officials are paying close attention to the development of Asia and plan to propose a plan similar to the Marshall Plan, so that the United States can supply Asia with major means of production.

Ambassador Ali mentioned this plan to reporters at the White House after bidding farewell to President Truman on April 14, before leaving the United States.

### US Advocates Revocation of Regulations Restricting Foreign Journalists; US Representative Moves at Freedom of the Press Conference

[Our Own Report] San Francisco, 27th Broadcast: The US formally submitted a draft today to the Freedom of the Press Conference, with the aim of abolishing all censorship systems worldwide, except for censorship for national security. Delegates will begin debating the US draft immediately, and the Soviet Union is expected to express opposition.

[United Press, Geneva, 27th] The United States plans to move at the International Freedom of the Press Conference on the 27th, advocating that all countries in the world abolish all regulations restricting the activities of foreign journalists. Brown, the publisher of the "News-Gazette" of Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, will represent the United States in proposing this motion. Brown said that the purpose of the motion is to end all disputes, such as those experienced by journalists in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. However, he admitted that the motion may not have an impact on Eastern Europe under Communist control. The motion also advocates that the final treaty at the close of the conference should include two major principles: (1) "Governments should encourage the mutual exchange of foreign journalists"; (2) "Governments should encourage the entry and exit of foreign journalists in accordance with the legal procedures for foreign journalists, and should not create special difficulties for the entry and exit of such journalists." Brown said, "The United States has already banned all Communists from entering the country, so Communist reporters are of course not allowed to enter the United States. They are not allowed to enter the country because of their Communist status, not because they are journalists."

### US Veterans Support Eisenhower for President

[Central News Agency, New York, 26th] US Veterans of Foreign Wars launched a new nationwide movement simultaneously in New York, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Detroit, Los Angeles, and other places today to support Eisenhower as the Democratic presidential candidate.

[United Press, New York, 26th] Roosevelt's two sons, Franklin and Elliott, issued separate statements today urging Eisenhower to run as the Democratic presidential candidate. Franklin said he was speaking as a "private citizen and veteran." Elliott stated that Eisenhower's nomination would enable both the liberal and conservative factions of the United States to unanimously support the US's plan to lead the world and promote democracy throughout the world.

### US Maintains Open Door Policy for Trade with Eastern European Countries; Export Controls Limited to Military Supplies

[United Press, Washington, 26th] Secretary of Commerce Harriman announced at a press conference today that the government has ordered that all materials, except those licensed by the Army and Navy, be stopped from being shipped to the Soviet Union and its satellite countries starting March 1, in order to avoid subsidizing the military equipment of those countries. Previously, President Truman also announced that military supplies such as airplanes, airplane parts, radar, electronic equipment, and small artillery detectors should be classified as weapons and not be sold to foreign countries. Harriman also said that starting March 1, the Army and Navy will have the power to cancel export licenses issued by the Department of Commerce, but this does not mean a complete cessation of US-Soviet trade. The government will still maintain an open door policy so that the Soviet Union can continue to be a friendly country. The United States hopes to obtain certain products from the Soviet Union, such as chromium and manganese, which are important raw materials for steelmaking. 29% of all chromium metal and 25% of all manganese metal in the United States come from the Soviet Union. The United States will supply the Soviet Union with clothing, cotton, tobacco, and consumer goods. Goods such as automobiles and trucks are still under review, and railway cars already ordered will still be shipped to avoid causing difficulties for American manufacturers. If the Soviet Union stops exporting chromium and manganese as retaliation, the US government will ask Congress to "implement important controls to urge foreign countries to supply the US with necessary materials."

[Reuters, Washington, 26th] The first major event to be discussed in the House of Representatives after the Easter holiday is whether to ban any exports to the Soviet Union. Democratic Congressman Colmer, the proposer of the embargo, has indicated that he will ask the House to vote on the proposal.

### Iraqi Foreign Minister Dies

[Reuters, Baghdad, 27th] Iraqi Foreign Minister Bajaji suddenly died of heart disease today at the age of 65. He had just returned from Beirut after attending the Arab League Council.

### Hungarian Enterprises Nationalized

[Reuters, Budapest, 26th] The Hungarian cabinet recently decided that all domestic enterprises with more than 100 employees should be nationalized.

### Romanian General Election Held Today

Communist Female Foreign Minister Criticizes Britain and the United States

[United Press, Bucharest, Romania, 26th] With the parliamentary re-election scheduled for the 28th, Communist female Foreign Minister Ana Pauker delivered a campaign speech today, saying that we are fortunate to be free from the heavy burden of the autocratic regime on our shoulders, and we will no longer be forced to bow our heads under the autocratic regime. The British and American imperialists once made the deposed King Michael read ten declarations that were not written by him.

### Military Training Abolished for Female Soviet University Students

[Reuters, Moscow, 26th] The Soviet Ministry of Higher Education announced that the military training of female students in Soviet universities will be suspended from April 1, with the exception of female students majoring in medicine, dentistry, chemistry, and transportation and railways. As for male students, military training will continue to be implemented as usual. Student military training was implemented before the war, with female students receiving only two hours of training per week.

### British Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia, Lord Killearn, Retires

[Reuters, Singapore, 27th] British Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia, Lord Killearn, has retired after 45 years of diplomatic service. He left Singapore with his family today to return to England. His position will be taken over by the Governor-General of Malaya, MacDonald.

### North Korea Holds Conference; US Does Not Oppose

South Korean Political Leaders May Attend

[United Press, Seoul, 27th] US occupation army officials today said that if the leaders of the right-wing parties in southern Korea, who are opposed to the May 10 general election, agree, they may go to the conference convened by the Soviet Union on April 14 in the north, as it may be beneficial to learn about the Soviet Union's handling of Korean domestic problems. However, it is necessary to pay attention to the fact that the Soviet military authorities in Pyongyang's invitation to South Korean political leaders to attend the meeting may be a trial balloon to test what kind of strength can be obtained from the south, or an attempt to undermine the United Nations agency's plan, which would only increase the confusion of the situation.

### US Government Formally Denies Talks Between US and Britain on Holy Land Issue; Holy Land Committee to Travel to London Next Month

[Our Own Report] San Francisco, 27th Broadcast: The war between Jews and Arabs was suspended yesterday because it was Good Friday, but it broke out again today. Jewish planes bombed Arab positions, causing heavy damage.

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] State Department spokesman McDermott denied that the US and Britain are negotiating the issue of Britain retaining troops stationed in Palestine. He did not know that the US had asked Britain to retain British troops stationed in the Holy Land until August 15, nor did he know that the US had suggested that the US bear the cost of Britain extending its stationing in the Holy Land.

According to British officials here, the US has not contacted Britain regarding the extension of Britain's withdrawal from Palestine. The US and Britain have maintained regular contact on the Palestine issue since the US proposed the trusteeship proposal, but this is only normal contact.

[United Press, Lake Success, 27th] A member of the United Nations Palestine Committee said on the 27th that the committee will travel to London next month to hold financial and economic negotiations with Britain. However, the US's attempt to undermine the plan to divide the Holy Land and suspend all actions of the committee, but the committee still intends to go to the British capital. If the US plan succeeds, the committee will not be able to exist, but it is clear that the US lacks sufficient support. As a result, the committee members were greatly encouraged. The plan to go to England was originally scheduled for April 7, and the US suddenly opposed the division, and the public opinion trip will be extended. However, due to Britain's decision to abandon its trusteeship of the Holy Land as scheduled, the trip to London was decided to be held.

### Japanese Overjoyed After US Announces Massive Aid to Japan; Rumors Spread That Japan May Be Allowed to Organize an Army

[United Press, Tokyo, 29th] US Under Secretary of the Army Draper announced that the planned US aid funds for Japan will be "larger than we expected." Japanese officials and the general public were overjoyed upon hearing the news. They believed that the US would pass the 180 million yuan aid "revolving fund" proposed by the Department of the Army and the State Department. Industrialists expressed their relief at Draper's statement that the US does not intend to freeze Japan's industrial level at the 1930-1934 level. However, they said that without raw materials, this statement is "like a picture of a cake rather than the cake itself." The financial community agreed with Draper's statement that Japan must balance its budget, but at the same time felt that some US financial assistance is necessary to achieve success.

[United Press, Tokyo, 27th] Japanese newspaper editorials today were optimistic due to the visit of US Under Secretary of the Army Draper and his party, fantasizing about large amounts of US aid. According to government authorities, observers, and qualified personnel, the economic recovery of Japan requires US$3 billion, but they warned the people that they must take part of the responsibility and endure hardship before achieving economic independence. In addition, rumors spread that Japan may be allowed to organize an army and amend the constitution regarding the prohibition of war and the reduction of the emperor's power.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] Japanese Economic Stabilization Board Director Kurasu Takeo submitted a four-point petition to the Draper delegation, requesting that the Allied Headquarters hand over administrative work and details to the Japanese government, and requesting the revision of the Economic Decentralization Act. According to people close to the Draper delegation, this petition was submitted to Draper after the meeting between US Under Secretary Draper and Kurasu Takeo. Here, Kurasu Takeo also suggested to Draper that Japanese people be allowed to go overseas to prepare to open up markets for Japanese products. At present, Japan is still regarded as the people of the former enemy country, and is prohibited from traveling overseas without the approval of the Allied Headquarters. Kurasu Takeo pointed out that in order to stabilize the Japanese economic situation, it is necessary to curb inflation, increase production, and prevent labor unrest. The four points provided by Kurasu Takeo to Draper for consideration are: (1) Increase the food ration by 10% to 20%; (2) Construction credit loans to Japan; (3) Administrative supervision by the Allied Headquarters; (4) Relax the scale of the Economic Decentralization Act.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] US Under Secretary Draper's inspection team flew to Korea this morning. After inspecting Korea, the team will return to Tokyo within the next week, and the results of their inspection will be announced together with the report on the inspection of Japan after returning to the US.

### Japanese Government Accepts Demands of Electric Power Workers

Tokyo Trams and Buses Completely Stopped

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 27th] The Japanese government accepted the new wage demand of 5,358 yen per month for electric power workers at the cabinet meeting on the afternoon of the 27th.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th] As the strike of Japanese government workers continues to expand, trams and buses here are completely suspended today. Unless an agreement is reached between the government and the workers, the tram and bus strike will be difficult to end for a while, and the entire city of Tokyo is now facing the inconvenience of transportation in the coming days.

### Counterfeit US Dollars Appear in the US

Said to Be Forged by Japanese in Shanghai

[United Press, San Francisco, 27th] US Treasury Department secret service personnel said on the 27th: In the past year, at least US$10,000 worth of counterfeit money has been shipped here from Shanghai, and the printing is so exquisite that it is considered the "most perfect" of all counterfeit money. The counterfeit money was made by the Japanese government for use in attacking the US West Coast. It is said that about 100 million yuan has been printed. It is also rumored that a bank in Shanghai stored too much of this counterfeit money, so it mixed one or two counterfeit bills into every batch of real bills.

### US to Conduct Deep-Water Atomic Bomb Experiment at Eniwetok Island in the Pacific; This Experiment May Have Already Been Conducted

[United Press, Washington, 26th] Well-informed sources believed on the 26th that the United States had completed its plan to conduct the sixth atomic bomb test at Eniwetok Island this spring. (Editor's note: Eniwetok Island is located in the southwest of the Marshall Islands in the southwest Pacific) Others said that this experiment may have already been conducted, but there has been no official disclosure. Still others believe that they have reason to believe that the first experiment to be conducted in the West Pacific testing ground is still a week away. They said that this test will be an underwater test, that is, a test at a "intermediate" depth, as scientists call it, at a depth of about 2,000 feet to one mile below the surface of the water.

### The Relationship Between US Presidential Elections and Business Trends

— (Special Translation by Our Editorial Department)

Election years are not necessarily years of economic downturn. However, if there is an economic downturn in an election year, then the party in power in the White House at that time will almost certainly be overthrown. History shows this.

As for the trend of business after the election, it is difficult to say, but which party wins seems to have some relationship to the future trend of business. Truman's election prospects and the state of business in the coming months are closely linked.

The fact that 1948 is a presidential election year does not mean that business this year will necessarily be sluggish. The chances of boom or bust are equal. However, if the current downward business trend continues until November, then President Truman will likely fail in the election.

The transfer of the presidency from one party to another generally occurs in years of economic downturn. In years of economic prosperity, this transfer rarely occurs. In the case of economic downturn, only a powerful leader or an abnormal environment can prevent the ruling party from losing the election.

Based on an analysis of 21 presidential elections since 1864, there are some similar views on the relationship between elections and business. Everyone believes that elections have less impact on business, and business has a greater impact on elections.

In the 21 presidential elections since 1864, the White House has changed hands from one party to another seven times. Of these seven changes, six occurred under conditions of a downward business trend. The ruling party was overthrown in good business conditions only once, in 1912. That year, T. Roosevelt broke away from the Republican Party and ran as a third-party candidate, resulting in the victory of Democrat Wilson. He only got a larger number of votes rather than a majority of votes.

A ruling party has been able to continue to occupy the White House in times of downward business trends only three times. However, these downward trends were not the kind of deep recession that causes unemployment.

In these 21 elections, business trends were upward after nine elections, downward after ten, and unchanged after two. This indicates that the policies and general conditions of the parties determine the trend of business, rather than the results of the elections. However, the results of the elections seem to have some impact on the business trend after the elections. Generally speaking, the business trend is often better after the Republicans win than after the Democrats win.

If we were to predict the results of the 1948 election purely based on business and elections, we can say that the business trend from now until November will play a decisive role.

Past records show that if there is an adverse change in business, then the Republicans will almost certainly win as a result. A slight downward trend in business may also produce the same result. However, if business can stabilize or have an upward trend in the coming months of 1948, Mr. Truman's chances of winning can be much better. The possibility of the President's victory is proportional to the trend of business.

This is a prediction based on the normal circumstances of the election. However, Mr. Truman's position is perhaps more dangerous than what has been said above, under the siege of both the left and right factions. (Translated from "World Report" Weekly)

Attendees included Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xianqing, Lu Yinchu, Xie Dahuang, Lei Kenan, Yao Wenying, etc., to discuss the disposal of draft-age men after the lottery drawing and the regulations for collecting family support fees for new recruits.

After that, the General Bureau continued to investigate based on clues from various sources. It was soon learned that another accomplice, Sun Zhilong, was hiding in a shed on Guangfu West Road in western Shanghai. They immediately went to arrest Sun. According to Shen's confession, the receivers of stolen goods, Sun Zhu, Chen Sun, Hu Jinman, Zhao Gaogen, Yu Wang Zhibang (Yu Zhijiang's wife), Chen Zhang Xiaomei, and Zhu Jinmiao, were arrested one after another.

He sat in the corridor of the Bank of China dormitory, and in the middle of the night, feeling hungry and cold, he noticed that the window of dormitory room 304 was not closed. Seeing overcoats, woolen sweaters and other items inside, he conceived the idea of theft. He sneaked into the room and stole some clothing, intending to escape. Unexpectedly, unfamiliar with the surroundings, he entered the room of a stationed guard, who apprehended him and turned him over to the court. Yesterday, Judge Zhong Xianda of the District Court opened the trial. Wang confessed the situation. Judge Zhong, finding the circumstances of his crime pitiable, imposed a lenient sentence, sentencing him to six months of imprisonment, suspended for two years.

### A Repair Ship Steaming into the National Gate: The Romance of the "Xing'an"

[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing, 26th] The first scene: March 22, 1948, General Gui Yongqing, acting commander-in-chief of the Navy of the Republic of China, held a press conference in the mess hall of a warship in Xiaguan, Nanjing. The room was decorated with ceremonial flags. Seated to his left was Commander Xu Shifu, the ship's captain. The camera moved outside the cabin, sweeping from the bow to the stern. This was the repair ship "Xing'an."

The second scene: December 8, 1947, Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Wang Shijie and Ambassador Stuart signed the Sino-American Naval Agreement in the reception room of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to this agreement, the United States, to assist us in building our navy, would donate 271 surplus ships below the escort destroyer class to China, including two repair ships, one being the 15,000-ton "Emei" and the other being the "Xing'an."

The third scene: June 28, 1947, Captain Xu Shifu led 98 officers and soldiers to New Orleans, a port on the Gulf Coast of the southern United States. They faced the predecessor of the "Xing'an," the "Achilles," a dead ship that could neither sound nor move. A small soldier's disappointed face, a disappointed voice:

"Is this the ship we came all the way from the motherland to receive? We are so sad that we are about to cry."

This is a Gift, This is Friendship

However, this is a gift, this is friendship, and most importantly, even this broken thing is something we don't have in China, and it is precisely what the motherland needs. The construction of the new Chinese Navy is difficult, and only by overcoming difficulties can we succeed. Captain Xu said:

"Our mission is to receive the ship, and we must bring this ship back to the national gate no matter what." In the scorching weather, these 99 officers and soldiers sweated and braved the sun, working diligently on the scorching deck and in the sweltering oil hold, carrying out the work of restoring the old and making the new, until the end of the year.

The predecessor of the "Xing'an" was the US Navy's No. 455 Landing Ship Tank. It began its service in the fleet on January 10, 1943. On May 2, it sailed to Sydney, Australia, and was converted into a repair ship. On June 2, it began its mission in Milne, New Guinea. In September, it participated in the Buna landing operation in New Guinea, where the stern soldier's cabin was bombed by Japanese aircraft, and the underwater propeller was also destroyed. In August 1944, it was named "Achilles" and designated as Landing Repair Ship No. 41. In October, it participated in the Leyte Island landing operation in the Philippines, where a Japanese suicide plane crashed onto the bow of the ship, killing the entire repair crew and creating a large hole in the deck. On June 10, 1945, it participated in the Brunei landing operation in Borneo. After the Japanese surrender, it returned to the United States and docked in New Orleans, where it was "decommissioned" in January 1946.

Surface Decommissioning, Actual Scrapping

The "decommissioning" here is actually "scrapping." The design of landing craft was originally for short-term use, and the construction of various parts was extremely crude. After the "Achilles" was converted into a repair ship, although the equipment of the repair department was increased, the basic equipment such as the hull and frame could not be transformed. Therefore, after suffering heavy damage in two landing operations, this original No. 455 Landing Ship Tank, compared to the same class of younger landing ship tanks (such as Zhonghai, Zhongquan, etc., whose numbers are all around 1,000) that had already been received in Qingdao last year, could be said to be extremely dilapidated. Before the Chinese government commissioned the US government to solicit merchants to repair it on its behalf, the wounds of the "Achilles" had not healed, the deck was twisted and deformed, and covered with layers of rust, the waterproof compartments in the hold were completely destroyed, the ammunition depot equipment was empty, and the diesel fuel had been poured into the freshwater tank. If the "retired" "Achilles" did not have a complete set of machinery and equipment, it would have been no different from scrap iron. The uniquely blessed US Navy would naturally "scrap" it.

40,000 US Dollars, Solicit Merchants to Repair

The "Achilles" that the Chinese ship receiving officers saw in New Orleans was still what it looked like after the US government had solicited merchants to repair it on our behalf after we had spent 40,000 US dollars. However, the workers who received a wage of 14 dollars a day and the contractors who handled the repair did not do their best to sufficiently improve the condition of the ship, because in the eyes of Americans, it was considered a waste of effort to spend effort on "scrap iron." What 40,000 dollars bought was a layer of paint applied on top of the thick rust on the deck, the waterproof compartments in the hold repaired, and the badly damaged right main engine partially replaced, but the dead ship was still a dead ship, still neither sounding nor moving.

Like houses that have been abandoned for a long time, the "Achilles" had no water or electricity, and was sealed by heavy dust. The officers waiting to receive the ship had to repair and clean it before they could move in. The first step was to restore the electrical equipment. There were three generators on the ship, none of which could be used. The first one was repaired, but it burned out again after two days, so they had to repair another one with a smaller horsepower and use it for power generation, slowly repairing the lighting circuits to drive the darkness out of the cabin so that other work could be carried out. Once the ship had lights, the second step was to solve the drinking water problem. The freshwater tank was unbearably polluted with oil. To make it clean and usable, the soldiers had to crawl into it through small holes to work. In the summer on the Tropic of Cancer, the hold was like a steamer. People inside were exposed to the heat and stuffiness, and almost one person fainted every ten minutes. The freshwater tank was cleaned and painted in this way before it could be used. Then the bedrooms and dining rooms were gradually repaired, solving the problem of living on the ship.

However, when the engines could not work, the "Achilles" was still unable to move. It had two main engines on the left and right, with no records of their past history, but the extent of their wear and tear told people that they had both exceeded the time limit for replacement. The contractor only replaced some of the necessary parts of the right main engine that could not move. The left main engine was damaged during the initial test run and needed to be repaired. The engine is what a ship relies on to move. The "Achilles" only had a 60-plus rib frame, which could not be considered very strong, and its own machinery repair equipment was relatively heavy. To make it safely cross the ocean and return to the motherland, it was even more important not to neglect the performance of the engine. Therefore, this most important repair work was not completed until half a year later, when it sailed away from Pearl Harbor.

After Renovation, Re-Equipping

In addition to the repair of the hold equipment and the power unit, there was also various renovation work. All the accumulated rust in various parts and the superficial paint purchased with money had to be knocked off again and repainted several times. Every bed, every chair, every table had to be re-fitted. Medical equipment needed to be greatly replenished; the machinery repair equipment materials had to be reorganized and purchased. As for the ship's defense equipment, it had been completely dismantled when the "Achilles" was decided to be "retired." Only one of the original twelve 40-caliber anti-aircraft machine guns remained, a circle of the gun mount, and some old traces of installation were found on the deck for the other twelve 20 mm caliber anti-aircraft machine guns. The four half-inch caliber guns were also missing. The asbestos equipment in the two ammunition depots was completely gone. After negotiations and repairs, the ammunition depots were repaired, the parts were fitted, but only less than half of the original weapons were equipped. The 40 mm caliber anti-aircraft machine guns were refused to be equipped, and only six of the twelve 20 mm caliber anti-aircraft machine guns were installed due to the position of the guns. Two half-inch caliber guns were installed, so in total, there was defense equipment.

The "Achilles" is a repair ship, but it itself had to undergo such extensive repairs. This seemed like an incredibly foolish thing from the American perspective, but after more than four months, this repaired repair ship finally came back to life. On November 5, the ship receiving officers formally took it over from the contractor and the US Navy Department, named it "Xing'an," and on November 7, it moved. Under the astonished eyes of thousands of people, this American ship that had been regarded as scrap iron and "scrapped," flying the beautiful flag of the Chinese Navy, roared and left New Orleans Harbor, heading for the motherland.

The restoration work of the Xing'an was difficult. The four months of hard work on the Tropic of Cancer was a severe test for the 99 officers and soldiers receiving the ship. This kind of memory is like a nightmare. Captain Xu was not very willing to mention those difficulties, especially those man-made difficulties, but he would not forget their hard work. At the press conference, he gave the example of repairing the freshwater tank. In the officer's cabin, he pointed to the wall panel and said:

"Look! Like this, we painted it five times."

### The Southwest Lifeline: A Record of the Construction Exploration of the Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway, Duzhu Section (Part 2)

The neighboring Bangshui No. 1 and No. 2 tunnels, with a total pilot tunnel length of 313 meters, were excavated on April 12th of last year. Because the stone is hard, protection is easy, and all widening and bottoming work is progressing faster. However, between Bangshui and Dalishu, mountains pile up, rising and falling. Where the railway line passes, it penetrates mountains and crosses valleys. Although it is only five and a half kilometers, the project is extremely difficult. There are a total of eight large and small tunnels and five large and small bridges. The earthwork construction has been poorly managed by migrant workers in the past, and the local county government has not yet assisted in the construction. It is said that this will be handled by special workers, and there is no major obstacle.

At 1:30, the jeep traveled on the material transportation road on the hillside. At around 2:00, it arrived at the Dalishu Bridge. The bridge spans the Dalishu River, which is the boundary between Majiang and Guiding counties. The railway slowly travels from the opposite bank of the river to the Dalishu Bridge, crosses the river, and then slowly extends to the Dalishu Station, forming a veritable electric light bulb-shaped curved line. Because the construction workers had no accommodation, the Dalishu Station was completed ahead of schedule last winter. The reporters were the first batch of passengers at the station, enjoying lunch there. The bridge construction site is about two kilometers away from the station. The bridge is 246 meters long, with nine spans and eleven piers. The highest pier reaches 35 meters, with a clear span of 20 meters. The bridge foundations range in depth from 11 meters to 6 or 7 meters. It is a large reinforced concrete arch bridge, ranking first among the bridges in the Duzhu section.

And it is the only large arch bridge on the South China Railway. The bridge foundations have all been completed, and the pier masonry is in progress. There are more than a hundred workers transporting material stone from the mountains five kilometers away. The contractor is the United Engineering Factory, a rising star in the engineering factory world. They have built a 300-meter-long stone transport chute on the mountainside, using the steel rails of a light railway inclined plane to save engineering costs. This is the only comical thing among the various tunnel and bridge projects in the Duzhu section. Because the Dalishu River is located between the mountains, there are flash floods, and the project is often hindered. The factory is specially equipped with four water pumps to take charge of drainage work, so the bridge construction is progressing smoothly. Since construction began more than fourteen months ago, the total project cost is nearly 30 billion yuan based on current values, and only about 20% of the bridge construction has been completed. If funds cannot be supplied on time, the project will be stalled. This bridge is of great importance to the entire section of the project, and all parties concerned are deeply worried.

At 5:00 PM that afternoon, the reporter group left Dalishu and returned to the material transportation road, continuing south towards Machangping at the 98-kilometer mark of the Qian-Gui Highway. Due to a jeep malfunction, we arrived at Machangping late at night around 10:00 PM and stayed overnight.

At 8:00 AM on the 13th, we left Machangping and arrived at Mapo, 10 kilometers away from Duyun, at 10:30 AM. Chief Engineer Xu Xuemao of the First General Section, Director Yao Yingzun of the Tunnel Construction Office, Director Zhao Jialiang of the Shibanhe Bridge Construction Office of the Third General Section, and many engineers had gathered at the Mapo Tunnel Construction Office the day before to welcome us, which was deeply appreciated. The Tunnel Construction Office rented a clean and refreshing farmhouse in a village of peach blossoms and white plum blossoms, with fallen petals filling the eyes with spring. After a short rest, we had lunch, and then Chief Engineer Xu accompanied us to visit the Qiaotoupou, Mapo bridges, and Mapo No. 1, 2, and 3 tunnels. The construction area of this section belongs to the First General Section, and the entire project is progressing quite fast. The entire section is 45 kilometers long, including ten tunnels, more than 1,000 meters long, and seven bridges, 604 meters long. The factories that have been contracted account for 25%. Other small bridges and culverts, about ten kilometers long, began construction at the end of 1946 and have now been largely completed.

### Demolition of Xijianhua Primary School in Wuxi, School Equipment and Books Smashed to Shreds

[Our Wuxi Correspondent, 26th] Lu Boxu, the head of the 32nd Bao in Daqiangmen Town, Wuxi County, and others, raised funds last winter to establish Jianhua Primary School, using the Xingling Temple near the Bao as the school building. There were more than 60 students, and Fan Zhenmin was hired as the principal. At 2 p.m. on the 24th of this month, while Fan was in class, Zou Futai, a director of a neighboring school, colluded with local bullies Zou Fubao, Lu Shuijin, and about twenty or thirty others, carrying "Fragrant Brand" incense, under the pretext of burning incense at the temple. They rushed into the school, coercing Principal Fan Zhenmin to quickly move the "Hua Tuo Master" and "Lu Tou" deity statues that had been moved away back to their original locations. The principal, seeing the fierce situation, took the opportunity to escape. The thugs shouted and started smashing things. Teaching equipment and books flew everywhere, smashed to pieces. They also tore the national flag and the portrait of the Founding Father of the Republic and threw them on the ground, then dispersed in a rush. After this incident, all the students and their parents went to the county government in the city on the 25th to petition, demanding the arrest of the rioters and bringing them to justice.

Near Mapo

Qingtaipo is the starting point of the Duzhu section, extending to Wendechang for about ten kilometers. Since both Mapo and Wendechang are rich in coal mines, which are used to supply coal for trains running south of Duyun that have been restored to operation, the focus of construction for the entire section is on all the tunnel and bridge work within these ten kilometers. In terms of this section of the project, more than 80 percent has already been completed. If funding and materials are available, tracks can be laid and traffic opened for military use in two months.

Reporters first visited the Qiaotoupu Bridge in Mapo. The bridge is 145 meters long, with seven piers and five spans, each with a span of ten meters. It is a reinforced concrete T-beam bridge. The bridge foundations and piers have all been completed, and only about 40 percent of the work remains. The contractor is Yuqing Engineering Factory, which is famous for constructing many large railway projects in Northeast and North China. The site manager, Mr. Dong, specially displayed models of various large and small projects undertaken to give reporters a glimpse of the whole picture. Next, we visited the Mapo Bridge, which is 74 meters long, with five piers and three spans, each with a span of ten meters. It is also a reinforced concrete T-beam bridge, and also a large bridge where railway and highway intersect. 70 percent of the project has been completed. We then visited the Mapo No. 1 Tunnel, which is 90 meters long. The pilot tunnel has been fully excavated, and more than a hundred workers are working hard to deepen it. Unfortunately, the rock quality at the eastern end is poor, and collapses often occur. They are currently using a winch crane to transport stone materials and construct stone arch linings to ensure the safety of the project in the future. The nearby Mapo No. 2 Tunnel has a pilot tunnel 150 meters long, and the breakthrough was even earlier, but the geological conditions are similar to No. 1, and collapses also often occur. They are currently clearing and adding stone arches to provide protection. Mapo No. 3 Tunnel was the last place the reporters visited on this tour of the Duzhu section project. The tunnel is 90 meters long. Because the rock quality is hard, construction started earlier and has been fully completed. All the work of expanding and deepening, drainage ditches on both sides, and refuge caves have been cleaned up and are impressive. Earth retaining walls of 30 meters have been built at both ends, the workmanship is solid, and the materials are reliable, adding a lot of scenery to the surrounding water and mountain views.

After the visit, it was already dusk, so we drove to Duyun and stayed at the First Section Office. After dinner,

we toured Duyun City and the railway station. The city is prosperous, and the streets are clean. The long embankment near the railway station is brightly lit even late at night, and there are many travelers, which is enough to prove that the industrial and commercial economy of places with trains is particularly developed. A mixed train departs from Duyun to Dushan and Nandan every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and it takes about fourteen hours to reach Nandan North Station. Trains depart from Nandan to Duyun every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Passenger and freight transport in this section is very frequent, probably because of the prosperity of southern Guizhou and the abundance of fine tobacco.

The reporters returned to Guiyang from Duyun on the 14th, recalling the various situations of the entire Duzhu section project visited in the past three days, and feeling very excited. Since the victory, there have been frequent alarms of war throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River. In recent years, the communist bandits have been particularly rampant. Only our southwest corner, especially Guizhou, has been able to provide peace and security, allowing us to devote ourselves to construction and preserve the vitality of the country. This is a great opportunity. The Duzhu section is the last section of the southwestern artery railway under construction in our country. At this time of national difficulty, empty treasury, inconvenient transportation, and skyrocketing prices, it is possible to have all the employees and workers adhere to the spirit of hard work and prioritize the project, which is no less than a unique treasure of our country. It is hoped that the government authorities will make good use of it, allocate the necessary funds as soon as possible, and raise and transport the necessary materials, so that this hundred-li and ninety-li railway project can be completed as soon as possible. This is not only what the people of the southwestern provinces are eagerly awaiting, but also the effort that the country and the nation should make in the current international situation of changing winds and turbulent waves.

### General Chennault on American Policy Toward China, Copyrighted by Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance

— Translated by Our Editorial Department

(1) The Inappropriateness of China Policy

Today, the six hundred million people of China and the United States are directly affected by the inappropriateness of American policy toward China over the past ten years.

Unless a miracle occurs in which the United States can at the last minute truly understand the actual situation, show reasonable sympathy for China and provide active assistance, plus a miracle in which China can at the last minute show courage and composure, then there are only two unfortunate alternatives: either causing the disaster of World War III, or causing the even greater disaster of the whole world surrendering to a global totalitarian system.

Whichever of these happens, the free people of the whole world will bear the tragic legacy of American procrastination. It would be a great irony that we Americans would have to fight to maintain our interests and freedom because we took the wrong path, or would have to shamefully entrust our interests and freedom to others.

In these essays, I want to reveal some details of this American maladministration. I want to say who should be held responsible for this mismanagement and why.

I will state names, dates and places. Some of the material I will reveal is still secret, much of it buried in the files of the War Department, the State Department and the White House.

Some of it is not comfortable to read. From the standpoint of the nation, it is not convenient to admit that we have treated a friendly people who trusted us in an unfair way.

It is not convenient for us to admit that we have failed to keep our promises to an ally.

It is not convenient for us to admit that we sold out Chinese territory in order to get the Soviet Union to participate in the war against Japan, and we did not obtain China's permission beforehand.

It is an uncomfortable thing to reveal that we gave the most valuable land in China to the Communists and did not seek any compensation for China.

I went to China in 1932 and have spent almost all of my time there since then. I organized and led the "Flying Tigers". I know all the senior American commanders in the Far East well, and I served with them when the war came. As the director of the Fourteenth Air Force, I knew the baseness of American policy toward China deeply. During the war, I saw how it worked. Now, I am in China, witnessing the unfortunate consequences of this policy today.

In those dark days in Chongqing, I noticed that Chairman Chiang united his country, which was trapped in poverty, and repeatedly called on his ragged army to resist the brutal Japanese offensive.

Chiang Kai-shek's battle was the most inspiring example of heroic leadership under extremely unfavorable circumstances.

Even as he was making this great effort, some American allies repeatedly stabbed him in the back. I feel ashamed to mention this.

For example, I was present when General Stilwell, the commander of the American forces in the China theater at the time, attacked Chairman Chiang in front of President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill. I will describe this and other things.

In short, American policy toward China and the activities of some American officials in China do not constitute a beautiful picture. But it is very important for the American people to know the background of the failure of American policy toward China. They may pay for this inappropriate policy with the blood of their descendants.

He does not want to whitewash the crimes committed by the central government in its relations with the United States. The Chinese government has raised many accusations on many things from American critics. I can't add anything more. But what I say may help put this criticism in its proper place, so that it can be viewed properly.

From a narrow point of view, the failure of Sino-American relations, which I believe the current situation is clear evidence of this failure, is mainly due to the difficulty in reconciling two different cultures, because each culture has its deep-rooted advantages and disadvantages that sometimes cannot accommodate other cultures.

But in addition to this conceivable limitation, there have been unforgivable failures on the part of those who implement American policy, which can only occur under circumstances of negligence, prejudice, shortsightedness, inaccurate judgment, and (I must add this, and I feel quite ashamed) a certain tendency to sow discord.

In these memories, I hope to outline some of the contours of American-Chinese relations in the past decade. I hope that in this way I can help other Americans understand the background of the many difficulties in our friendly cooperation with the Chinese National Government.

A fundamental question must be answered, and that is: after the United States maintained the traditional principle of opening the door to China at the cost of the war against Japan, how could it tolerate and even help Soviet communist forces replace the Japanese imperialism that had been crushed in China?

Part of the answer lies in a historical fact, and that is that we did not truly uphold the Open Door policy in China until Japan launched its attack on Pearl Harbor. This was four years after Japan launched its conquest of China and ten years after Japan seized Manchuria.

This simple and solemn historical fact should give Americans a lesson: it is never possible to compromise with aggressors at a low price.

In order to find other reasons for our fickle attitude toward the influence of Soviet communists in China, we must explore some aspects of the relationship between Americans and the Chinese government, which has recently been recognized by the public, and the Chinese Communist puppets.

This is simply the work of a historian. But the history of our time is so fluid that we cannot wait for it to condense before studying its nature. If we have to wait for the next generation of researchers to piece together this sad record, it may be too late.

The inappropriateness of our country's policy toward China in the past decade began in 1937, when Japan launched its conquest of China. From the outset, this action of Japan was against the great interests of the United States and world peace. We did nothing, or almost nothing.

What Japan did in Manchuria in 1931 is similar to what we see today in the Soviet support of the Chinese Communists. This does not need to be proven, because in fact these puppets are armed with weapons seized by the Soviet army from the Japanese Kwantung Army, and the Soviet army's invasion of Northeast China was at the invitation of the United States in Yalta.

What Japan did in China in 1937 may soon happen again—this time not a Soviet invasion in the Japanese style, but through the puppet forces of Eastern Communists. The plan is the same, and from a military strategic point of view, it is even larger than Japan's ultimately failed "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

### Beware of "Schistosomiasis", Warning Signs Erected in Suzhou

Xu and Hai Counties Telegraphing the Ministry of Water Resources for Prevention

[Our Correspondent, Zhenjiang, 26th] Chairman Wang of the Jiangsu Provincial Government recently reported that according to a telegram from Kaifeng on March 22nd, the Yellow River is flowing downward from Houji directly to Jia Zhuang (located in Heze County, Shandong Province). Although it was not a dangerous project in the past, the embankment is thin. In the event of a breach, the situation will be exactly the same as the Dongzhuang breach in 1935. The counties of Heze, Juye, Jinxiang, and Yutai in Shandong, and the counties of Feng, Pei, Pi, Tongshan, Su, and Shuyang in Jiangsu will be submerged. The various counties of Xuhai in northern Jiangsu are even more frightened by the news, as the people cannot bear any more disasters after the floods.

### Northeastern Students Repeatedly Rejected by Peiping Universities

[Our Peiping Correspondent, 27th] Northeastern University students stranded in Peiping told reporters that most universities in Peiping refuse to allow students from Northeastern universities to audit classes.

Currently, only the Railway College allows students from the Northeastern University preparatory class to audit classes.

### West China University, a Center of Medical Education by the Wanli Bridge in Chengdu

[Our Chengdu Correspondent, 23rd] Leaving Chengdu's southern suburbs and crossing the famous "Wanli Bridge," a few hundred steps to the left will reveal lush greenery, tree-lined paths, and towering buildings - this is the "wartime university city" of Huaxiba. Now that the five missionary universities have returned east, only the old owner, West China University, remains. However, because of the nationwide fame of the dental school at West China University, Huaxiba is still a center of medical education in the Southwest today.

More than Forty Years of History

West China University is one of the oldest missionary universities, founded in 1910 (the third year of the reign of Emperor Xuantong of the Qing Dynasty). Initially, it had three departments of arts, sciences, and education. In 1913, it established a medical school, and in 1914, it added a dental school. In 1933, the university was divided into three colleges: arts, sciences, and medicine. During the more than thirty years since the establishment of the dental school, successive directors such as Dr. Lindsay and Dr. Qizhendao, Dr. Tom Bosen, and Dr. Mores were all internationally renowned dental authorities. Thanks to their careful planning and diligent cultivation, the progress of the West China University Dental School progressed rapidly, gaining international acclaim and earning the reputation as the leading dental authority in East Asia. Over the past thirty years, graduates have spread throughout the country, writing a glorious page in the history of Chinese medical education.

Currently, the person in charge of the medical school is Dr. Cao Zhongliang, and the person in charge of the dental school is Dr. Lindsay. There are 273 students enrolled in the medical school and 150 in the dental school, all on a seven-year program. The first year is pre-med, and the second and third years have the same curriculum, including basic courses such as histology and embryology. Students begin specializing in the fifth year, with the last two years focusing on clinical practice. After completing the seven-year course and undergoing a long period of clinical practice, they can graduate. Because the school implements scientific and rigorous training, the performance of West China University medical and dental graduates is well-known throughout the country.

Father of Chinese Dentistry

Dr. Lindsay, the 65-year-old internationally renowned dental authority and Dean of the Dental School, has served at West China University for over thirty years. He has successively planned the establishment of dental schools at Central University and other universities, with students all over the world, earning the nickname "Father of Chinese Dentistry." The dental school includes departments such as restoration and oral medicine, which study filling, inlay, and medical techniques, as well as courses in pathology and histology. The specimen collection is particularly rich, with everything from the head bones of primitive creatures such as salamanders to the head bones of apes, rabbits, and various humans being collected. Education is entirely based on the American system, paying special attention to the relationship between dentistry and general medicine, emphasizing general medical training.

The medical school has been established for thirty years and boasts the most complete equipment and longest history in the Southwest. The general equipment is very complete, with a deep X-ray machine for the specialized treatment of tumors. Surgery is unique in both internal and external medicine. The school also has an anatomy lab with six dissection tables. The corpses are all preserved, and each corpse is dissected by eight students, dissecting the skin, muscles, and internal organs layer by layer. Dean Cao Zhongliang is an internal medicine expert, and the internal and external medicine departments of West China University Medical School are well-known among medical schools in China.

Future Development Paths West China University Dental School's contributions to society include teaching hospitals, including a university hospital, oral hospital, leprosy hospital, tuberculosis sanatorium, mental hospital, and eye, ear, nose, and throat hospital, which are the most prestigious large hospitals in the Southwest. In addition, the medical school library has a rich collection, with over 6,000 rare Chinese and Western medical books and over 70 medical magazines.

As for the future development path of the West China University Dental School, Dean Cao told reporters: China's medical progress is almost on par with Europe and the United States. In the future, to promote the development of Chinese medicine, we should first implement a public health system, so that doctors can become specialized technicians to strive for the progress of medical technology. Vice Dean Luo Zonglai, one of the persons in charge of the dental department, believes that we should focus on discovering the relationship between dentistry and general medicine to prevent various diseases caused by the "transmission of lesions" from teeth and oral cavity. The spirit of the West China University Dental School is to encourage graduates to join hospitals or medical education institutions to seek research and improvement, and then seek the progress and development of China's new medicine from research and improvement.

### The Strength of the Allentaiters is formidable, the Da Gong team wins after a hard battle, 69 to 65, the winner is determined after extra time.

The tension and enthusiasm of this game can be compared with the battle between Hualian and Da Gong. When the 40 minutes were over, the score was tied at 59. An additional five minutes were added and Da Gong won with a score of 69 to 65.

The agility and stability of the guest player Shifuller, and the elusiveness of Ateson, often made the Da Gong team panic. The two can be described as dangerous elements in Da Gong's eyes last night. Looking at the team's playing style, it is very organized. In all fairness, their strength is no less than that of Da Gong or Hualian. And the health of the physique and the calmness of the battle, if they can play a few more times in the city sports hall, and become familiar with the arena, they should be watched with wide eyes. Da Gong's performance was also impeccable last night. It is commendable that the two armies fought to the end with the five generals who had always played.

When the two armies came into contact, Tu Wenlong hit two goals from the right, followed by Bo Ling. In the first quarter, Da Gong laid the foundation with 16 to 8. In the second quarter, the US military gradually became active and the score approached. In the first half, 33 to 30, the guest army had a tendency to come from behind. After the third quarter was launched, Shifuller and Ateson launched mutual counterattacks, and the score was tied at 34. They also surpassed 38 to 37, and the third quarter was tied at 47, which was quite worrying for Da Gong. The last quarter was the most tense. With 4 minutes and 35 seconds left, the score was tied at 55 each. Alan fouled and Cai Wenhua made a free throw, adding a precious point. Shifuller scored two consecutive goals, 59 to 56, and the US military was on top again. Wenlong made a free throw to score one point, and Wenhua scored a corner kick, making the score tied at 59, and the cheers were overwhelming.

In the five minutes of overtime, Stan made two free throws and Wenhua made up for his mistakes, tying the score again at 61. Shifuller's goal almost became a fatal injury to Da Gong. Wenhua scored again, which can be described as escaping from death. From then on, Da Gong's prestige was greatly enhanced and they scored three consecutive goals. Stan scored a basket and Da Gong won with a score of 69 to 65.

### In the Midst of Market Holiday Announcements, Rice and Grains See Slight Increase

Due to the market holiday next Monday for the Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial, the rice market, together with Sunday, will be closed for two days. There are many people in this street who are adding to their stocks in advance. Moreover, credit is slightly looser, and cargo owners are reluctant to sell because they have to wait until next Tuesday to deliver the goods after unloading them. For this reason, prices have seen a slight increase. The white japonica rice in the North City market is 3.7 million yuan, and thin rice and early rice have increased by 100,000 yuan. The South City market has increased slightly by 50,000 yuan. The Civil Food Allocation Council sold a total of 935 stone of thin rice, early rice, and white japonica rice in the South City market.

The goods arriving yesterday were still scarce, with 2,440 stone in the South City market and 1,929 stone in the North City market.

Flour

With credit slightly looser, cargo owners no longer suppressed prices to sell. Also, due to the two-day holiday and the need to wait until next Tuesday for delivery, cargo owners were reluctant to sell. With buyers seeking goods, prices were strongly raised, and prices rose sharply. The opening price of old car flour was 1.5 million yuan, but the market later returned slightly to 1.49 million yuan. The closing price of Bingchuan was 1.485 million yuan, an increase of 40,000 and 60,000 yuan respectively.

Soybean cakes took the opportunity to rise, each rising by 450,000 yuan.

### Tea Prices are all at Peak

Tea owners have not increased their stocks, and the production period for new goods is still waiting, so they are reluctant to part with the goods in their hands. Buyers are still in contact with each other from all sides, and because the market's money frequency is turning loose, they are not hesitant to move forward. However, the number of transactions is not large, and the market offers are all at a high peak. Looking ahead, there is fear that it will be difficult to meet its sharpness.

### Bureau of Standards Promotes Industrial Standardization

[Reported by this newspaper] The city's Edible Oil Trade Association has explained the reasons for fluctuations in edible oil prices, clarifying that there is no hoarding. They stated that the recent price fluctuations are due to: (1) It is currently the peak season for soap production, and sales are expected to be robust. Those with capital are actively purchasing and storing oil. Additionally, soap factories are allocated only slightly over 3 million yuan in goods, but the market price has soared to over 5 million yuan. The reason for this discrepancy is quite evident. (2) Since the post-war recovery, there has been a shortage of edible oils worldwide. Domestically, the expansion of the war has disrupted transportation, making procurement difficult. (3) The price of tallow is not as high as 16 million per dan (unit of weight), as claimed by the Soap Industry Association. The Soap Industry Association should be required to submit purchase transaction documents for public judgment. (4) The Dayuan Company recently attempted to purchase 400 barrels of edible oil from Chongqing, but the authorities have prohibited their shipment. Negotiations are currently underway.

### The Current State of Copper Product Production and Sales in the Shanghai Area

— Qin Hao

(1) Introduction

Shanghai is the largest city in China and the nerve center of the country's industry and commerce. The rise and fall of various industries significantly impacts the entire nation. To understand the overall state of a particular industry or trade in China, examining its situation in Shanghai is sufficient to gain a general understanding. The copper products industry is an important light industry with a relatively long history in China. Its main products are copper sheets, copper rods (commonly known as copper ingots), and copper wires, supplemented by various other components. Copper sheets are further divided into thick and thin types, with the thick ones commonly known as copper plates and the thin ones called copper sheets. Copper wires are distinguished as ordinary copper wires and enameled copper wires.

Currently, there are fewer than 500 factories in the Shanghai area that specialize in or produce copper products. Privately owned factories account for the vast majority, with only the Central Mint and the Central Electrical Equipment Factory under the Resources Committee being state-owned. However, both factories far surpass private factories in terms of equipment and productivity. Among the private copper products factories, they can be further divided into copper rolling mills, metal smelting factories, and hardware industrial factories. Due to limited capital, they are smaller in scale, and their organization and equipment are inevitably crude and simple, falling far short of their counterparts in foreign countries.

The production status and equipment of state-owned and private factories will be described in detail below:

(2) State-Owned Factories

A. Central Mint The Central Mint is located at No. 3 Hebei Road at the end of Jiangning Road and is vast in scale, occupying approximately 80 mu of land. Before the war, its main business was minting various coins. Later, when the government implemented a paper currency policy, the factory's business also changed, and it switched to refining various copper products to meet national defense needs. When the Anti-Japanese War broke out, the factory was ordered to relocate to Chongqing. However, due to the urgency, important machinery and equipment could not be moved. After Shanghai fell, the factory was occupied by the Japanese invaders, and most of its machinery was dismantled and removed, resulting in significant losses. Although it was restored after the victory, its interior had been completely transformed, making it difficult to restore its former appearance.

The factory's current equipment includes only three rolling mills (down from ten before the war) and ten smelting furnaces with a capacity of 2.5 cubic feet (down from forty before the war). It employs approximately 300 workers. In terms of production, it can cast about 3 to 4 tons of copper ingots and about half a ton of brass sheets per day. It is actively planning to increase production, intending to extend working hours from nine to twenty hours. It is estimated that it can then produce more than one ton of brass sheets and about 8 to 9 tons of copper ingots per day. In addition to the materials supplied by the Materials Supply Bureau, it also purchases old copper coins and electrolytic copper from the market to supplement its needs.

Currently, the factory uses kerosene as its main fuel for the smelting furnaces due to insufficient gas supply. The method involves storing kerosene in a tank about twelve feet above the ground, allowing it to automatically generate pressure. The kerosene is then sprayed out through nozzles, and with the aid of forced air, the kerosene is directly injected into the furnace hearth. The heat can raise the temperature of the crucible suspended in the furnace hearth to about 1300 degrees Celsius, melting the raw copper.

There are only three rolling mills currently. Copper sheets can be rolled to a thickness of 0.3 millimeters, but the width is quite limited, with a maximum of only seven inches. However, to meet market demand, it currently only rolls two types, four inches and six inches wide.

In addition, there are three annealing furnaces. Two use bituminous coal to generate heat for annealing copper products, while the other still uses kerosene to generate heat. Because the temperature is more even, the annealed copper products are of better quality.

The factory's brass sheets are made by mixing 65% electrolytic copper with 35% pure zinc and then smelting, forging, and rolling. There are many holes and cracks, so the copper sheets must be inspected and remelted in the furnace, which is quite cumbersome. The copper ingots it produces contain only 90% copper, with the remaining 10% being iron and sulfur. The presence of these impurities reduces the ductility of the copper products and increases their brittleness.

In terms of sales, copper sheets are more popular, and the main customers are small factories in the city, especially flashlight and pen factories. There are occasional shipments to Jiujiang, Nanchang, Bengbu, and other places for making foot warmers, copper hangers, washbasins, and other utensils. The sales of copper ingots are sluggish.

Overall, the factory's current situation is that its output is relatively small and there are not many styles due to limited equipment. Active improvements and expansion are needed. It is said that a rolling mill is currently stored in a former enemy factory in Yangshupu. The width of the roller reaches 24 inches. If it is used to roll copper sheets, it can roll to at least 22 inches wide. The factory is planning to find a way to use it. However, because the machine was originally used to roll lead sheets, the type of roller is different from that of a copper rolling mill. Whether it can be used is still a problem, and preliminary tests are currently underway. In addition, the factory sent personnel to Shenyang last summer to seek to receive the equipment of the local mint in Shenyang and transport it to Shanghai for use. Whether this has been realized is unknown.

B. Central Electrical Equipment Factory The Shanghai First Branch of the Central Electrical Equipment Factory is located at No. 826 Hejian Road, Yangshupu, occupying approximately 10 mu of land. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was originally operated by the Japanese. Initially, it only had a rolling mill, specializing in the casting of copper sheets and copper wires. Later, it was expanded to include a smelting mill and an electrolytic mill, planning to directly refine refined copper from crude copper to further cast copper sheets and copper wires. However, because the average copper content of the waste copper raw materials collected at that time was only about 85%, and the smelting method was not good, the copper ingots produced had a content of only about 95%, with much iron and other impurities contained within. It was not suitable for use as the anode copper for electrolysis because the purity of the electrolytic copper obtained could not reach 99%. Therefore, it was still under research and improvement at that time. Soon after, the overall victory arrived, and the factory was taken over by the Resources Committee. It made overall plans to transform the factory based on all its existing equipment and enlarged the reverberatory furnace (now capable of holding five tons of copper material). After more than a year of rectification, most of the factory's equipment has been perfected.

The factory's current equipment includes: one blast furnace, one reverberatory furnace, one boiler, sixty electrolytic cells, one annealing furnace, two rolling mills, and four large and small rolling mills for rolling copper wires.

In terms of production, the electrolysis chamber can produce about 1.5 tons of electrolytic copper per day. Some parts are used to draw copper wires. However, the electrolytic copper produced is not enough for its own use, and it must be purchased from other state-owned enterprises and manufacturers to supplement its needs.

The factory's copper smelting process is to first put the waste copper raw materials into the blast furnace. After they are melted and some impurities are removed, they become copper ingots with a purity of 95%. They are then put into the reverberatory furnace for hydrogenation reduction refining, resulting in anode copper with a content of 99%. This anode copper is then electrolytically refined in the electrolysis mill to become cathode electrolytic copper with a content of 99.95%. Finally, after annealing and other procedures, it is drawn into various thick and thin copper wires with a diameter of 3.1 mm to 0.8 mm to meet the needs of electrical engineering. Another part of the electrolytic copper with a poorer composition is sent to the Third Branch Factory to roll copper sheets. The thickness of the purple copper sheets it produces ranges from 0.18 inches to 0.25 inches, and the thickness of the brass sheets ranges from 0.005 inches to 0.05 inches. The width is 4 inches to 10 inches. In terms of length, the thin ones are about 3 feet or more, and the thick ones can reach up to 8 feet.

The quality and quantity of the various copper products produced by the factory are increasing day by day, so sales are very smooth. However, the scale still needs to be expanded because, in terms of the factory's existing equipment, it is still quite far from the general copper factories in Shenyang, Kunming, and other places.

(3) Private Factories

A. Copper Rolling Mills The copper rolling mills in Shanghai were originally members of the Copper and Tin Trade Association. Their main business was manufacturing copper sheets. Later, because the industry was purely a production business and belonged to the commercial association, which did not match the reality, it was reorganized in 1946 to establish the Shanghai Copper Rolling Industry Trade Association. The association is located on Chenghaiwei Road, and the person in charge is Mr. Yu Zhongnan.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the copper rolling mills were successively occupied by the Japanese army and manufactured various military supplies. The machinery and equipment of a few larger factories were dismantled and removed, resulting in significant losses. After the victory, the factory owners began to recover and resume operations.

At the beginning of the victory, the copper sheet industry experienced an unprecedented prosperous scene due to the urgent need for goods in the market and the inability to meet demand. Moreover, because raw materials were abundant and prices were low at the time, the ratio of raw material prices to finished product prices was about one to five. The profit margin was considerable. As a result, newly established copper rolling mills sprang up like mushrooms after rain, reaching a peak for a time. However, the good times did not last long. Since last summer, due to the impact of the economic downturn and the scarcity of raw materials and high prices, the profit margin of finished products has become thin, and sales have gradually become sluggish, so the entire copper rolling industry has once again fallen into a state of depression.

### Overview of Yingkou

Yingkou is located on the side of the Liao River. For more than a hundred years, the accumulation of mud on the banks has created a plain alluvial soil of the Liao River, hence its name as a "delta." In the early years of Daoguang, it was first named "Mogouying," and later renamed Yingkou. The trade of Niuzhuang, Chengtian, Zhuangtai, and other places in the upper reaches of the Liao River gradually shifted to this area. In 1858, according to the Treaty of Tianjin, a British consulate was established in Yingkou, and it gradually developed, becoming an important port for the export of agricultural products from the Liao River. Soybeans piled up like mountains, and oil mills stood in great numbers. Since the Russo-Japanese War, its position has gradually been taken by Dalian, so Yingkou's reputation has diminished compared to its former glory.

Yingkou has a population of approximately 200,000. The streets are tidy, and the riverbank is about two li long from east to west, with a vast area. It used to be one of the largest trading ports in Northeast China and the largest connecting line between the mainland's commercial economy. Water transportation is extremely convenient, and land transportation is the terminal of the Dashi branch line of the China Chang Railway, with roads extending in all directions. Goods are distributed and collected here. Exports include soybeans, sorghum, oil, soybean cakes, etc., and imports include medicinal materials, tea, bamboo cotton, pottery, grain, and other items.

After the victory, the National Army and the Communist bandits fought over the city several times, causing severe damage. After the hard work of the garrison, it has been restored to its former appearance.

### Tomb-Sweeping Day

— Jingwen

The Western holiday of Easter is commonly called the foreign Tomb-Sweeping Day, while our Tomb-Sweeping Day is also called the grave-sweeping festival. These two holidays, although originating from two different folk traditions, both express humanity's joyful mood for the arrival of spring, and both express humanity's love for life.

From a religious perspective, Easter was originally a holiday with a somewhat sad meaning, because the page before Easter is the tragedy of Jesus being crucified. However, Easter, which has been passed down to this day, has mixed in many so-called pagan cultures from medieval European agricultural societies. For example, the colored egg that symbolizes Easter is because ancient European farmers believed that eggs laid on the spring equinox could be stored for years without spoiling. On Easter day, farmers brought many eggs to churches to ask the priest to bless them. In addition, in the minds of ancient farmers, the egg was God's masterpiece, symbolizing the sun—the spring sun—and also symbolizing the universe. The Easter eggs that are popular on the market today, although dyed in various colors, were originally red, meaning to represent the holy blood of Jesus.

Our Tomb-Sweeping Day—the grave-sweeping festival—also carries a somewhat sad meaning. For example, these days when you look out of the train windows at the many earthen graves with paper pennants fluttering on both sides, you can't help but be filled with many illusory musings. You may think that although you have entered another spring, you are also taking another step closer to the eternal winter. You will recall the voices and faces of your deceased relatives and friends and think that he or she has been lying in the lonely wilderness for many years, thus a feeling of sorrow surges in your heart.

I personally feel that the sad emotion of mankind is not only a noblest emotion, but also the most powerful cooling agent for the muddleheaded world. When you stand in front of the grave of your relatives and friends, facing the offerings of fresh flowers or incense, you cannot help but feel a moment of disillusionment with the noisy secular life. All concepts of fame and fortune have absolutely no room to stand in front of the grave. I even have such a ridiculous idea that if the political leaders and warmongers of all the hostile countries in the world were to discuss world issues at the tombs of unknown heroes in Paris, New York, Moscow, or other countries, I dare to believe that world peace would be achieved. Magnificent palace-style venues have always been the stage for politicians to engage in verbal battles behind the backs of the public and have never contributed to true world peace.

But whether it is the grave-sweeping festival or Easter, beyond their sad implications, they also contain a concept of humanity's love for life. The religious meaning of Easter certainly focuses on this point. Even our grave-sweeping festival, in addition to remembering ancestors and deceased relatives and friends, can also arouse in us who are still alive a sense of gratitude to the Creator. Especially for families with many descendants, when you see your children surrounding the graves of your ancestors, you will surely feel a kind of unspeakable comfort on behalf of those in the tomb. Your children may never have had the opportunity to be close to your previous generation of ancestors, and even facing the solemn cemetery in their young hearts, they may not feel anything special. However, you certainly know that in the two worlds of those inside and those outside the tomb, there is still a connection of eternal life, and you feel that life is particularly precious.

Although some people argue that the concept of family or clan is feudal thinking, in reality it is not. The feudal system is a social form of a certain economic system. Feudal society may produce clans, but there is no direct relationship with the concept of family. Although the family cannot exist apart from society, I believe that under any social system, as long as a person knows that he has parents, the idea of family will never disappear. People in primitive society may not have this concept, but today's world, no matter how it turns backward, will probably not return to primitive times, at least not in people's minds.

Grave-sweeping and resurrection seem to be exactly the opposite in terms of words, but they are the same in encouraging people to trace new life from the past. This is enough to prove that although the expressions of Eastern and Western cultures are different, the hearts of people around the world are the same.

### Mud Can Cure Diseases

— Daoxian

The Czech Republic is a well-known exporting country, but in addition to glass, industrial products, etc., the Czech Republic also exports a large amount of mud every year. Of course, this is a very special kind of mud, limited to the mud in the famous "Piestany mud spring" area. It is said to have medical value and can cure rheumatism. Every year, it is packed in boxes and sent to hospitals and pharmacies in Australia, South America, Canada, and Palestine.

### The Greatness of the World

— Le

The most prolific writer in the United States was Edward Stratemeyer (1862-1930) from Newark. He used more than a dozen different pen names to write cheap novels specifically for children. In the last thirty years of his life, he wrote as many as 800 of these novels, selling them for more than $10 million. The French government now issues lottery tickets once a week, selling about 500,000 tickets each time. Each ticket costs about $2.18 U.S., and there are also tickets sold in strips, with each ticket divided into ten strips, each strip costing about $0.22 U.S. There are a total of 137,328 prizes, with prize money ranging from $2.52 U.S. to $67,200 U.S.

The World Games held in London from July 29 to August 14 this year were attended by 54 countries. The total number of athletes is expected to be at least 5,500. Compared with the previous edition (1936, Berlin), the number of participating countries has increased by 11, and the number of athletes has increased by 1,500.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the United States can be said to be the most efficient detective agency in the world, but it has only been established for 25 years. Currently, the bureau has 3,800 agents, all of whom have received a university education and then undergone rigorous training. It has a collection of as many as 160 million fingerprints.

### Awkward Moments

— Shiyu

You are walking down the street. If you walk to your destination in one breath, without seeing anything or encountering anything, your walk is meaningless. If you accidentally trip or even collide head-on with a passerby, your walk is full of meaning. The journey of life is like this. If you have accumulated good fortune in your previous life and your life is smooth, you will live too unbeautifully. If you are unfortunate and often step on stones under your feet, life is full of meaning. No hero has not fallen and climbed up again; nor is a good book written in one breath. Herries bragged to George Bernard Shaw because he had been "romantic," while Shaw lacked romance to speak of. Many successful politicians sigh all day in their old age, just because they never sat in jail when they were young. Generally speaking, the rich understand life the least. But if he goes bankrupt, the next dinner is full of meaning.

Forgetting to buy a ticket when taking the tram, forgetting to bring money when watching a movie, sneezing at a banquet, falling down the stairs at your girlfriend's house. You bring one million yuan to treat your friends to dinner, and the bill comes to 1.1 million. Such situations are common in the real world. A story from an old "Reader's Digest" says that two friends who are not very familiar with each other meet in a social setting:

"Look! The one wearing the bright red cheongsam is too flashy. It would be more suitable for her age to dress more simply!"

"Are you talking about my cousin?"

"Ah! I mean the one next to your sister!"

"That's my wife!"

Such a scene is enough to make us feel "sorry" all over. But the words spoken cannot be taken back, which is called an awkward moment. Comedians and humorists make money by creating this "awkward moment"; life also becomes colorful because of this "awkward moment." Since we are human, there is no "perfect person" in the world. But people with a little status or a little reputation always like to pretend to be "perfect people." So, once a paper tiger is exposed, it becomes a laughingstock. It is said that New York journalists love to fall in love with generals and talk about art with Wall Street tycoons, in order to create awkward material.

Yesterday, I went out for a walk and saw a stall selling baked sweet potatoes at the end of Model Road. I am a glutton, thinking that I had not tasted sweet potatoes for many months, so I ignored my dignity, weighed 10,000 yuan worth, and started eating it at the stall. There are many Nanjing refugees. Two refugee children were vying for the peels that I peeled off. Because I thought it was cute for them to grab it, I weighed 10,000 yuan worth and gave it to them. But when I touched my pocket, I forgot to bring money. I had to negotiate with the stall owner, saying that I would give it to her tomorrow, but she was furious.

"I don't know you. Where can I find you?"

"Then what should I do? This 20,000 yuan!"

"Leave something here with me!"

I gave her a magazine in my hand. She told me that newspapers were now 80,000 to 90,000 per catty, and this thin book was not worth 20,000 yuan.

"What to do? There's nothing to pawn!"

She sized me up and down. Finally, she took a fancy to the glasses I was wearing on my nose.

"Pawn this thing here!"

At this time, there was already a circle of nosy people surrounding us. I thought it was impossible to negotiate with this old woman. I took off my glasses and blurred my way back to school.

We like to watch "awkward" movies and like to hear "awkward" stories. But only when we personally experience "awkward" moments do we understand life.

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 13: Salvation by the Militia (111)

Zhu Zhai, having thought this through, decided to go home and take a look. He instructed the rickshaw puller to go to North New Bridge. When the rickshaw arrived at his doorstep, Zhu Zhai saw that it was already past ten o'clock. After knocking on the door for a while, Feng Sheng, wearing her nightgown, came to open it. When she saw it was Zhu Zhai, she asked, "What are you doing here at this hour?" Zhu Zhai replied with a smile, "I came to see you and have a few words with you." Feng Sheng said, "You don't come during the day, but you come at this hour! There's someone here, you don't need to come in." When Zhu Zhai heard her say there was someone at home, he suddenly became suspicious and said, "This is my home, why can't I come in?" Feng Sheng said, "Go away, it's inconvenient for you to come in." Zhu Zhai refused to listen, stepping inside and saying, "I want to see who it is!" Feng Sheng said, "It's my friend, you don't know them, it's useless to go in." Zhu Zhai pushed her aside and rushed into the room. He heard Feng Sheng chasing after him, shouting, "Sit outside! There's someone inside!" Zhu Zhai ignored everything and rushed into the bedroom. He saw a person lying on the bed, completely covered by a sheet, even their face was covered, only a pile of dark hair was visible on top of their head. Zhu Zhai thought that Feng Sheng must have left a man in her room, and his anger flared. Without hesitation, he rushed to the bed and ripped off the sheet. He was shocked to see that it was a woman with powder and rouge, her disheveled hair scattered on the bed. He quickly backed away, and as he turned to leave, Feng Sheng grabbed him from behind, shouting, "Zhu Zhai! You have no manners! What kind of behavior is this?" Zhu Zhai was both frightened and ashamed, and quickly said, "I... I didn't know, please forgive me." Feng Sheng said, "No! You have to apologize to Miss Li, then I will let you go." Zhu Zhai had no choice but to turn around, bow to the female guest on the bed, and repeatedly say, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry." Then he turned and walked out. Feng Sheng followed him, as if monitoring him, saying, "Go away, I'll spare you today, don't come again!" Zhu Zhai said, "Feng Sheng, I have something to tell you, let's talk for a few minutes." Feng Sheng said, "There's nothing to say, go away! It's getting late, hurry up and leave! It's not convenient for you to be here." Zhu Zhai said, "This is my home, what's inconvenient?" Feng Sheng opened her eyes wide and said loudly, "This is your home? You don't have this home, go away!" Zhu Zhai said, "You won't even let me say a few words?" Feng Sheng said, "We've said everything, there's nothing more to say, leave!" Zhu Zhai said, "What I want to say today concerns the rest of our lives, don't be angry, please listen to me calmly, okay?" Feng Sheng said, "No! No need! There's nothing between us, I already consider you dead!"

### ### Swindling

— Jiujiu

In 1878, a Mrs. Humbert in Paris suddenly announced that an American millionaire named Crawford had bequeathed his entire estate of twenty million dollars to her. Crawford's two nephews demanded a share of the inheritance, leading to a protracted lawsuit. The court, facing difficulties in its investigation, delayed its judgment. Securities and stocks held in the bank by Mrs. Humbert were deemed untouchable by the court due to the undetermined property rights, forcing her to borrow money to survive, promising to repay everything as soon as the lawsuit ended. Parisian merchants, knowing that the lawsuit would inevitably be in her favor, seized the opportunity to provide her with a steady stream of loans—at exorbitant interest rates—preparing to make a fortune.

However, the case remained unresolved for twenty-four years. During these twenty-four years, Mrs. Humbert raised a total of eleven million dollars, enjoying a rather comfortable life.

But in 1902, it was finally discovered that the so-called American millionaire Crawford, in fact, never existed! The creditors panicked and rushed to the bank to open Mrs. Humbert's safety deposit box, only to find it empty.

Among these creditors, ten committed suicide as a result. A new trial by the court revealed that the so-called two nephews of Crawford were actually accomplices of Mrs. Humbert. Their twenty-four-year lawsuit was merely a smokescreen, and the ignorant Parisian judges had, in effect, become accomplices of these three swindlers.

### ### Lament for Tonglu

— Shi Shufan

Entering Tonglu in broad daylight, the city is filled with a ghostly atmosphere, empty houses cast tall shadows, a scene of desolate waste. Feet tread on rubble and tiles, shattered and difficult to distinguish, above, crows fly in flocks, dogs play in the streets. Climbing the mountain behind the government office, the rice is tall, reaching the knees, dry grain sends out frosty shoots, once used to feed the barbarian cavalry. On top is a large white poplar, built like a bunker, spying on our army on the river, transmitting electricity to fire weapons. The Tongjun Temple is close by, the Buddha ruined, the pagoda also abandoned, rowing upstream in the past, now separated by a lifetime. The guide said: the city fell in summer, the eastern wind and barbarian dogs proud, the old and weak unable to escape, drawing their knives to rape and plunder at will, many women committed suicide, corpses were not buried under the scorching sun, often abandoned in ponds, once the plum rains passed, the water was red with severed arms floating, seeing the blue sky in July, few houses remained unburned, surviving people gathered again, spending the night in the wind and dew, drawing water to cook tea and rice, human grease stuck to the pot, swarms of flies fought to chase, what taste did they know entering their mouths! Who knew that at the beginning of August, a greater calamity would be remembered, enemy planes covered the sky, stones turned red, the river water boiled, startled souls dared not return, and long stayed in the wilderness. On quiet nights, looking at the empty city, the pain was extreme, turning into tearlessness, counting the few tung oil lamps, lonely soldiers and historians.

### ### Raindrops

— Shi Jimei

A butterfly is a social butterfly; once made into a specimen, it's a glamorous corpse in a funeral home.

"Quickly cuckoo, quickly cuckoo!" In the early spring wilderness, it sings all night, singing until it vomits blood; the cuckoo, like Qu Yuan, the Three Dukes, who embraced a rock and sank into the river, is just as great.

If geese are organized, then a lone goose is an individualist.

Some people write stories with a pen, and others, with their own lives.

"The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every individual." — Most individuals interpret "responsibility" as "blame" rather than "duty."

The elderly are the most innocent because they regard all young people as fools.

After dusk, draw the curtains and light the lamp, but you won't forget the darkness outside.

The way of the wolf and the bai to deal with the world is official protection, crabs walk sideways because they have no intestines; cuttlefish want to be cultured, so they absorb a bellyful of ink.

The most loyal and honest friend is a mirror.

Qingming Festival, the living put on a show, with the deceased making guest appearances.

April Fool's Day is a day of great laughter for self-proclaimed clever fools all over the world.

If an old lady doesn't chant scriptures, she'll go crazy; so it's best not to break superstitions.

### ### West Lake Poetry Records

— Banmeng Laoren

The beauty of West Lake lies, in my opinion, with Bai Causeway. Its grass is as soft as a carpet, its flowers as red as brocade, with distant mountains and nearby waters woven into a wonderful natural painting. Often there are graceful figures in pairs, with red makeup and green sleeves, basking in the warm sun and gentle breeze, lying in the floral carpet, whispering sweet nothings, happily forgetting their weariness, hardly knowing what age it is.

As for Su Causeway, the north-south distance is too long, and compared to Bai Causeway, its charm is slightly inferior. In the middle, besides the wide road, there are also small brick paths on both sides, shaded by willow trellises, making it extremely comfortable to stroll around. From time to time, men and women ride bicycles together, speeding past like lightning. In the early morning or at sunset, I often sit alone in a small pavilion, composing poetry and seeking inspiration, considering myself enjoying a quiet blessing, occasionally writing: "A pair of figures rush by on wheels in the wind, drooping willows on both sides tied like silk, mostly solitary poetic companions are few, accompanying me in the pavilion sitting often. (The pavilion is named Banshan Pavilion.) Near Jiang Villa, the red railing bridge, deep courtyard with no one, tree shadows swaying, white gulls outside the door more leisurely than me, a pair standing with raised feet where the lotus flowers are red. (When lotus flowers bloom, white gulls often stand on one foot, their whiteness accentuating the flower's red.) The mountain light on both sides meets the water light, listening to the clear waves in a winding curve, tired, I prop my chin on a stone table, idly watching light boats glide in the setting sun."

After my trip to Hangzhou, my will remained undecided. My poetry friend, the Lay Buddhist Mujushi, went to Ziyun Cave first, and then urged me to go with a poem: "Yan Zhai sends letters from the sea, asking me about leisure in the mountains, the joy of mountain living is endless, how can I remember each item from the beginning. I remember the morning light dyeing the quilt, eating my fill all day, but playing, the rising sun fills the east window, this is a place of wonder, the temple is known for its ingenuity. (The temple's name) A bowl of porridge in the early morning and I go out, cane and straw shoes wherever I wish, sometimes visiting the immortals' relics, the ancient well and cinnabar are still recognizable, overlooking the spring from the Chuyang platform, the misty water I look at freely, happy to hear the golden drums drinking in Yellow Dragon (both cave names), casually entering the ancient temple, the mood strikes me so I idle on Su Causeway, the drooping willows so affectionate to give shade. Walking I suddenly pass Apricot Blossom Village (on the side of Su Causeway), buying wine to come back to get drunk, the purple bamboo shoots and garden vegetables all in season, plain rice actually makes me tired of meat and grease. Once drunk and full I fall into peaceful sleep, the yellow orioles sing loudly, urging me to come out, grabbing my clothes I stand in front of the door, mountain and lake light rush into my eyes, bamboo forest and pine trees I wander under, wild grasses and hidden flowers are charming, standing alone on the high peak, I shoot the colorful clouds onto my chest, occasionally inviting the bright moon to knock on my wood door, the clear light enters my dreams in the middle of the night. These days the spring rain has been incessant, sitting around I don't need to put on Ruan Gong clogs, the misty scenery is right at the window, glittering and making wondrous sights, a person in the mountain is within a painting, understanding the painting and seeing the real thing. There is another matter to tell you, I face the place of burial everyday (going out of the mountain gate, seeing graves), I wonder when this hole will be my final resting place, once I sleep I will truly be happy, alas, Huan An still has a hermitage he cannot return to, and I am still burdened by worldly matters, Yan Zhai and Huan An are one and the same, what is the point of not returning to Yan, giving up the beautiful scenery before me!" Yan Zhai and Huan An are both my nicknames, and the decision to go to Hangzhou was made.

Later, after the Dragon Boat Festival, I went straight to Ziyun, and lived in a room separate from the lay Buddhist Mujushi. Opening the window, I faced West Lake, with flying clouds on the ridges and moonlight sifting through the pines. Often I saw white birds flying low and yellow orioles talking to each other, unknowingly washing away all worldly dust. I wrote a poem to record it: "Accompanying fairy companions to Pengying, sleeping high in the cave, the guest is feeling clear, white clouds on the ridge as leisurely as me, the black-robed friends in the mountains talk of non-birth. (The abbot is a western monk who comes often to discuss Zen.) Morning meal sitting and facing a thousand flower buds, waking from a midday nap to the sound of birds, worldly glory and dishonor, why ask, a peaceful heart doesn't care." Later, the abbot compared me to Vimalakirti, so I sat cross-legged in meditation, closing the door to practice meditation. At this time, I only hoped for the moon to light up the heart of the waves, and the wind to stir the surface of the water, to have a bright and clear image. Occasionally I wrote: "Staying a short while in Louxia, (next to Miaozhi temple, there are caves called Qixia.) all thoughts extinguished, all matters ceased, rolling spring flourishes beautifying my temples, rustling wind leaves the moon above. Human life is fleeting like dew among flowers, Buddhist Dharma is a compassionate boat on the sea, washing away the dust on my lapel, I have no self-image, I am a lone seagull in the heavens and earth."

One day, I went down the mountain, and on the Lingyin road, I suddenly met Zen Master Huanjue. Huanjue is a poetic monk, and it had been ten years since we last met. We shook hands with joy, and I composed a poem on the spot to give to him: "Smiling and meeting on the banks of West Lake, shaking hands in the same car, recognizing the old face, one sentence of Amitabha revealing the profound mystery, ten years of deep connection imprint our wandering traces, green mountains and green waters, idle clouds passing by, fragrant trees and sweet dew, Dharma milk soaking, working hard upwards cannot be achieved, everyone work hard on the peak." We returned to Ziyun together, discussing Zen and debating the Tao every day. The master gave me a poem: "Who would have expected such a fortunate encounter on this sacred lake, shaking hands in surprise, seeing the old face, one thought of non-birth extinguishing accumulated habits, a hundred years fortunate to rest like duckweed, cave heaven and blessed land, a quiet place of joy, green trees and clear springs, the taste of Tao is rich, deeply understanding the Zen of Tathagata, I envy you for occupying the wonderful peak first." Huanjue studied Confucianism and Buddhism, scrutinizing all books. After gathering for more than a month, he left.

The weather gradually turned cool, and I visited Master Huanjue in a small hermitage on Ziyang Mountain. The master prepared a vegetarian meal for me, and the dishes were exquisite. I said to the master, "We, who roam beyond the world, regard our bodies as travelers. The burden of food and drink is already superfluous, let alone undeserved?" The master said, "Today is the Buddha's birthday, and the vegetables are slightly prepared, slightly better than Ziyun. Your praise is excessive." After the meal, we went out of the hermitage together and climbed to the top of the first peak of Wu Mountain. Looking down, smoke rose from countless stoves. The sky was high and the sun was bright, with a great wind blowing wildly. We tried to open our umbrellas to shield us from the sun, but could not withstand the wind, so we descended the mountain by another path. I improvised a poem: "The grand view from the top of Wu Mountain, the rivers and lakes open on the left and right, opening the umbrella against the wind, wanting to fly away, ten thousand families, well walls sandwiched on all sides." Along the way, we passed Tiaodong Rock (place name) and visited Dharma Master Zhao Zhen. The golden image of the Buddha was magnificent. Behind it was a high slope with a four-sided pavilion built on top. Crystal curtains and green doors, the fragrance of sandalwood filled the air. The green trees embraced each other, the shade thick, and I could not bear to leave. I also got a quatrain: "Intent on repairing monasteries everywhere, the Buddha's face shines on sentient flowers, collecting the heart and lowering the head, compassionate father, purifying thousands of differences and ten thousand differences." After going down the mountain, we parted ways.

When I was sitting quietly, I opened the window to look at West Lake from afar. Lay Buddhist Mujushi especially liked to lean on the window sill with a long chair, sitting and watching the vastness. I often sat with him. One day it rained, and it didn't stop for a long time. I saw more than a dozen people in white hemp clothes on the mountainside, men and women mixed together, carrying a coffin up the mountain, lowering it into the pit for burial. In about three hours, the tomb was covered, and the men and women went down the mountain together, never hearing the sound of crying, like a scene from a movie. The ancients said, "In the blink of an eye, the wilderness becomes a grave." And, "Leaving behind dry bones buried in the wild, where do the vast spirits go?" Those who are enthusiastic about utilitarianism can take this as a lesson. I got a couplet: "The four elements form a false combined form, a sudden breakdown severs the life soul, in the desolate grave under the autumn wind and bitter rain, who are the husband and wife, who are the descendants? Soil makes clothes and wood makes skin, sleeping long and slow, scattering my present self, who threw it into the corner of the empty mountain, only to accompany the decaying bones. Love and affection in life are forgotten in death, mistaking tenderness for the homeland, letting go of the hand in the Yellow Springs, departing separately, white clothes accompany each other to the final resting place. The family has no sorrow, I shed tears secretly, sending you off, the person is gone, the earth surrounds, the lonely grave is accompanied by nothing else, desolate weeds and lush green fill the mountain!" Blowing the wrinkles on a pool of spring water, what is my business, throwing down the pen I laughed to myself, and the lay Buddhist Mujushi also smiled.

Ziyun Cave is behind the mountain of Chuyang Terrace, and it is even closer to climb Geling. I have repeatedly wanted to climb Chuyang at night to see the moon, but stopped because I had no companion. This summer has ended, and I have returned to Shanghai, counting on my fingers, I have only gained four months. My poetry friend, Mr. Cheng Guojun, asked about it remotely with a poem, and I replied: "Four months of leisurely living and extravagant travel, embracing the deep secluded north and south peaks, the willow color of Six Bridges encloses the long causeway, the lotus fragrance of ten li collects in the ancient cave. The lone crane of Lonely Mountain is already faint, coming again to the scenic spot, all the talent of a whole ox, how can I bear to walk with a cane in the west wind, the desolate Xiao temple is not to be lingered." Painting is silent poetry, and poetry is colorless painting. Use this record as a reclining travel map, wouldn't that be almost right?
