This kind of democratic style and competitive method is especially meaningful for political education in our country. Now, at a time when crises pervade the situation in Europe and Asia, President Truman's election by the American people to continue in office is sufficient proof that Mr. Truman's past domestic and foreign policies have gained the support of the American people.

### US Navy Still Staying in Qingdao; Remarks from Washington Diplomatic Circles

[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] Diplomatic circles stated on the 4th that the United States still intends to maintain US Navy personnel in Qingdao unless Communist troops approach the area.

### Production Business Loans Approved Will Be Released Immediately; Regulations for Adjusting Interest Rates of Banks and Credit Unions Planned

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] The Ministry of Finance convened a meeting of responsible officials from the Central Bank on the morning of the 4th to discuss the policy for production business loans, and a draft was drawn up. It will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval after the wording is organized. Once approved, it can be implemented, and production business loans can be released immediately. During the meeting convened by the Ministry of Finance on the morning of the 4th, Lin Chongyong, representative of the Central Bank, and Chen Dacheng, advisor to the Ministry, and several others attended, presided over by Wang Fuzhou, Director of the Currency Department. Regarding the policy for production business loans, the meeting made clear decisions based on the principles previously instructed by President Weng and with reference to the methods previously implemented by the Four Banks Joint Administration. The most important of these is that when national banks and bureaus underwrite loans, their sources of funds must not be obtained by issuing funds for lending, but must be raised from the deposits absorbed by the various banks and bureaus to serve as loans. At the same time, the Central Bank should continue to strictly handle rediscounts and re-mortgages, reducing them as much as possible. When the Central Bank handles rediscounts and mortgages, it should be based on the amount of "unified fixed deposits" and "loan reserve funds." If the amount of these two items is large, it can be handled; otherwise, it can be handled less. As for other national banks handling loans, they can decide on their own within a certain range. If this range is exceeded, it will be decided by the Central Bank's discount and loan committee. There are four loan targets: (1) production businesses for daily necessities, (2) basic industrial and mining businesses, (3) public utility transportation businesses, (4) export trade businesses, which are the same as the targets determined by the Four Banks Joint Administration. The loan methods have also been decided, including mortgage loans, export packing loans, and order loans. Loan interest rates were also discussed at the meeting, and it was decided to handle them in a separate case.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Regarding the issue of adjusting the interest rates of banks and credit unions after the price limits were lifted, the Ministry of Finance has drafted a method and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is reported that the low-interest policy adopted in the past has been decided to be lifted in principle. In the future, the loan interest rates of national banks and bureaus will be agreed upon by the Central Bank's discount and loan committee in consultation with the various national banks and bureaus and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for record. The interest rates of commercial banks and credit unions will be agreed upon by the local banking associations and reported to the local finance department and the Central Bank for approval.

### Tibetan Business Delegation Leaves the United States for Britain for Investigation

### Ministry of National Defense Releases Weekly Battle Report: Major Victory for National Army in Jinxi, Over 80,000 Bandits Wounded in Attack on Taiyuan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 4th] The Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense released its "Weekly Battle Report" for October 28th to November 3rd on the 4th, stating: In the past week, the various battlefields, except for the Northeast and North China, have been relatively quiet in the Central China region. Apart from the National Army continuing to suppress and eradicate bandit remnants in northern Jiangsu and eastern Henan in the Central Plains, there were no major battles on the Tianjin-Pukou, Beijing-Hankou, and Longhai lines. The battle situations in the Northeast and North China are detailed below:

(1) Northeast Battlefield

The situation on the Northeast battlefield changed considerably during the week. In order to coordinate the overall situation and strive for a final victory, the National Army no longer stationed large forces at points and lines that had lost their strategic significance.

For three years, the Northeast National Army has done its utmost to maintain the national territorial sovereignty. After Changchun and Jinzhou fell to the bandits, the bandits again used the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, and 10th Columns to try to prevent the National Army from advancing westward in areas such as Heishan, Xinlitun, Banlamen, and Xinmin. Another force consisting of the 1st, 6th, 12th, etc. Columns and the 3rd, 4th, 6th, 9th, and 10th Independent Divisions, as well as the Korean communist Li Hongguang's troops, roamed around the outskirts of Shenyang, starting from Xinmin in the west, Tieling in the north, Fushun and Benxi in the east, and Haicheng in the south, all engaged in combat. From October 30th to November 1st, the fighting approached Dongdaying, Beiling Airport, and Gaolichun. Our army inflicted heavy casualties on the bandits amidst their attacks and harassment from all directions. The fighting continued until dawn on the 2nd, when external communications from Shenyang were cut off. According to air force reconnaissance reports, our army has transferred in different directions according to the planned schedule. In the Liaoxi area, there has been continuous contact from Xinmin in the east to Juliuhe and Liaozhong. The bandits did not dare to use their main force to attack us in this area, so our army was able to safely transfer to designated areas according to the planned deployment. In the Jinxi area, the bandits' 4th and 11th Columns north of Gaoqiao are being severely attacked by our army. Jiangjiatun, west of Dayubao, has been recaptured by us. The bandits' 9th Column, suffering losses, fled north. At the same time, the bandits' Independent 4th Division, entrenched in Xingcheng, was defeated by us, and the city has been recovered. Currently, the active operations of the National Army in Jinxi have made the bandits afraid to confront them head-on.

(2) North China Battlefield

The Taiyuan offensive and defensive battles became increasingly fierce during the week. The bandits' New 4th Brigade and the Xin detachments, along with the 8th, 7th, and 15th three columns, with more than 50 artillery pieces, launched an all-out attack on the eastern city of Naoma Village, Xiaoyaotou, and the highlands south of Niutou Village from the afternoon of the 29th. Our army met them head-on and concentrated various firepower to suppress the attacking bandits. The intensity of the fighting was unprecedented since the beginning of the Taiyuan defense. By dawn on the 30th, the bandits, suffering heavy casualties, saw their offensive falter. On the afternoon of the 31st and November 2nd, the bandits launched two offensives towards Naoma Village, Xiaoyaotou, Niutuozhai in the east of the city and Huangzhai Town in the north of the city. Except for the National Army in Huangzhai which transferred to nearby core positions and continued to fight fiercely with the bandits, the rest were repelled by us. In total, over the past month (from October 1st to 31st), the bandits attacking Taiyuan suffered over 83,800 killed and wounded, and 3,041 bandits were captured. Our army's casualties were only over 15,300 officers and men. The comparison shows how many innocent lives were sacrificed under the bandits' "human wave tactics." Although we lost some outposts, the price we paid was meaningful.

The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 8th Columns of Nie Rongzhen's bandits and the Yao Zhe bandit troops, who were roaming around the periphery of Gui-Sui, have been lurking in the mountainous areas in the past week, not daring to make large-scale movements. However, recently, the bandits occupying Sa County and Baotou have gathered in the west of Guisui, and scattered bandits are already active in areas 15 miles from the city.

Recently, the bandits' New 8th Division in the area north of Huailai and south of Longguan on the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway line attempted to attack Huailai by surprise, but were unexpectedly encircled and suppressed by the National Army in the area around Shangxia Douziying south of Longguan. In half a day of encirclement and annihilation, it is estimated that more than 2,000 bandits were killed or wounded, and 1,473 bandits were captured alive. 764 rifles, 34 light and heavy machine guns, 6 artillery pieces of various types, and many other military supplies were seized. The results are still being expanded. Our National Army, moving south along the Beijing-Baoding line, quickly captured Fangshun Bridge, Wangdu, Qingfengdian, and other places. The bandits' 7th Column, suffering losses, fled to both sides of the Beijing-Hankou Railway. This kind of mobile strategic action by the National Army has induced the main forces of the bandits' 3rd and 4th Columns from southern Chahar to central Hebei, Yixian, and Mancheng. Ideal results may be achieved in this area.

### Congratulations to Truman on His Re-election

And May We Learn the Spirit of Democracy and Freedom of the United States

The U.S. presidential election results were announced at midnight on the 3rd. President Truman took the lead in 26 states, winning 304 electoral votes and being re-elected, while Dewey, who was generally predicted to win, surprisingly lost. When the news came out, the world was mostly surprised, viewing it as a miracle in American politics. In fact, President Truman's re-election is not worth being surprised about, not only can it not be considered a miracle in American politics, but it is also sufficient to represent the true spirit of American democratic politics.

Let us put aside the reasons for Truman's victory for the time being. The world's anticipation of Dewey's victory in the presidential election with almost complete certainty was due to the hints from various predictions made by the American broadcasting and newspapers. However, the American broadcasting and newspapers may not be able to truly represent public opinion, especially in the heat of the campaign, broadcasting and newspapers are regarded as propaganda, even if it wants to control public opinion, it cannot control the free will of the American people. It is only because American citizens have a high level of knowledge, each has his own views on the government's policies, and is by no means a blindly following crowd who parrots what others say, and the election system is truly secret and free, no one can use the slightest coercive method to influence others' voting. Therefore, President Truman's election is a lofty expression of the democracy and freedom enjoyed by the general American people, worthy of our admiration and learning. As Gu Weijun, our ambassador to the United States, said: "The American people have complete and absolute freedom to choose the public servant who governs the country." Indeed, the result of this election is a powerful demonstration of true democracy in American politics.

This matter is very clear to third parties, that is: American voters support President Truman, allowing him to be re-elected, probably because Truman is full of the spirit of struggle. Truman's performance in the past three years has been seen differently by different people, and there may be disagreements. However, the current world situation is critical, on the verge of collapse, and changing rapidly. The objective situation does not allow the US government to change, let alone allow a more than two-month "vacuum" period in American politics, giving the aggressor totalitarianists an opportunity. Everyone knows that in recent years, the American people are not only well-informed about world affairs, but also have a clear understanding of them. Everyone understands the true meaning of the "Truman Doctrine" and everyone understands the role of the "Marshall Plan." Facing the fact that the United States has been making concessions step by step in the "Cold War," it is naturally not allowed for the Truman government to retreat again in the face of violence, but Truman is required to continue to work hard to carry out his original intention. In this election, from the very beginning, the outside world spread the atmosphere that Dewey could win, this atmosphere increased day by day, but President Truman did things his own way, still actively struggling, until the last day of voting, without the slightest slackness. This spirit of struggle is the spirit needed by the United States in dealing with major domestic and foreign problems. The reason why American citizens elect Truman may not be unrelated to this. Because the political platforms and policies of the two major parties, the Democratic and Republican parties, are not much different in nature, especially the foreign policy pursued by the Truman government, is a policy unanimously agreed upon by both parties. Secretary of State Marshall attended any international conference, and Republican dignitaries such as Vandenberg and Dulles attended together. Before deciding on the policy on any major international issue, he must also reach a consensus agreement with Republican dignitaries. It can be seen that the choice of American voters this time is not necessarily a choice of policy, but a choice of who is more suitable to deal with the overall situation. They believe that in order for the United States to cope with the current critical world situation, instead of entrusting the heavy responsibility to a newcomer to take risks and try, it is better to let the current government handle it with ease, and besides, Truman's re-election can also fill the political "vacuum" of more than two months.

As for observing from the perspective of American domestic affairs, Dewey's failure may be attributed to the 80th U.S. Congress. Why do you say that? After the end of the war, the general public seemed to be tired of the Democratic Party's long-term rule, and there were some disappointments with the Truman government's performance, so when the members of Congress were re-elected, the majority of people tended to the Republican Party, and this 80th Congress was under the control of the Republican Party. Unfortunately, the bills passed and the activities carried out by the 80th Congress inevitably ran counter to the wishes of the people in terms of domestic affairs, especially the Taft-Hartley Act, which deprived workers of the right to strike, was rejected by the general public. As Green, Chairman of the American Federation of Labor, said: "The American people have clearly expressed their rejection of the reactionary spirit of the 80th Congress. The Democratic Party must launch a 'progressive action' to abolish the reactionary labor law." From this, it can be seen that the 80th Congress invisibly created a bad impression, causing most voters to shift from leaning towards the Republican Party to the Democratic Party again. But in any case, when the Democratic Party was about to go downhill, it was revived by President Truman's leadership. Although it was promoted by some points of the Republican Party's domestic policy, President Truman can be proud of it after all.

In short, the wishes of American voters today are: for the world, they hope that the government can calmly cope with the offensive of the "Cold War," reverse the tide of the world, and create lasting peace; for the United States, they hope that the government will continue to implement the "New Deal," strive for economic rationalization, eliminate the black shadow of the current economic panic, and maintain domestic stability and prosperity. This time, President Truman won from a dangerous situation, and he will be able to better understand the wishes of the people. He will strive with all his strength for world peace and American prosperity, so as not to disappoint the expectations of millions of voters who enthusiastically support him.

### Suspects Who Burned Down the British Consulate in Shamian Tried in Guangzhou Special Criminal Court Yesterday, Prosecutors and Defense Lawyers Request Leniency

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th] The Guangzhou Higher Special Criminal Court held its first public trial of nineteen suspects accused of burning down the British Consulate in Shamian on the 4th to 6th. The court opened at 9:30 AM on the 4th, with Court President Fu Shilan serving as the presiding judge. Prosecutor Xie Songya first stood up and stated the reasons for the prosecution, saying that the evidence of the defendants' crimes was confirmed through interrogation, but the defendants were all young and vigorous, and their motives for committing the crime were likely due to temporary indignation, with no intention of offending. The judge was asked to consider this point and reduce the punishment appropriately. Due to time constraints, Luo Gang (typesetter at Daguang Newspaper), Situ Guang (student at Sacred Heart High School), Liu Su (vendor), Feng Zhao (student at Nanwu High School), and Liang Jian (vendor) were interrogated first. They confessed that they were arrested by military police as suspects for watching the excitement in Shamian or the west bridgehead of 622 Road two or three hours after the British Consulate was burned down at 1:30 PM on January 16th this year. The defendants' defense lawyers Shen Zhenzhong, Chen Yuheng, and others stood up one after another and argued that the defendants' statements could be proven by facts, and they could not be found guilty simply by listening to the accusations of one or two military police. Moreover, the relevant witnesses had not been interrogated by Zhu before concluding that they were guilty, and the defendants' places of origin, residences, and occupations were all different, and the indictment could not be designated as accomplices and joint offenders. Furthermore, the occurrence of this case was the result of the destruction of Chinese residences in Kowloon City by the Hong Kong government. At that time, our diplomatic commissioner in Guangdong and Guangxi stated that if this caused an unfortunate reaction, the Hong Kong government should be responsible. Subsequently, the case was caused by the Guangdong-Guangzhou-Kowloon Incident Support Association mobilizing the public to march. It can be seen that even if it is a crime, it is not a personal problem of the defendants. Moreover, since the defendants are not communist cadres and the evidence is insufficient, they should be acquitted. The trial of Deng Jinheng, Liang Changming, Zheng Feixiong, Chen Yipu, Bao Hanzhuo, and Li Xiantai will continue at 2:30 PM, and the rest will be interrogated on the 5th and 6th.

When necessary, this committee may designate some items and businesses related to people's daily lives for price setting. (3) Price setting should be based on the price negotiation standards in Article 9 of the Implementation Measures for Price Review, and should be based on the cost of goods, with appropriate profit margins added according to local industry precedents, and the calculation of the cost of goods in Article 10 should include manufacturing or purchase prices, including interest (not exceeding the loan interest rate agreed upon by local banks and money houses), taxes, transportation fees, warehouse rent, management fees, insurance fees, and depreciation.

Wuxi [Our Report from the West, 4th] After the rice shops opened for one day, they stopped business due to price increases. Today, it is rumored that middle peasants are purchasing, so prices have soared to 115 yuan. The market has decided to sell widely again throughout the city starting on the 5th, with white japonica rice at 105 yuan and white indica rice at 95 yuan. Today, other markets have not officially opened, with flour at 44 yuan, wheat bran at 46 yuan, and soybeans at 100 yuan. As a result, soybean oil has jumped to 340 yuan, and there is demand without supply. Various industries are still unable to open for business today, and the authorities are strictly investigating and dealing with brokers.

Suzhou [Our Dispatch, 4th] Local white indica rice is now trading at 90 yuan per stone, coarse japonica rice at 85 yuan, and japonica paddy rice at 40 yuan. Transactions are still rare. Retail vegetable oil is 2.1 yuan per catty. Commercial factories are still closed. There are many vendors and cigarette stalls in Guanqian, and the prices are not accurate. The county government held a price review meeting yesterday and decided: (1) Industry associations should report costs before the 6th, and the association will review prices. (2) The price standards will refer to those in Shanghai and Wuxi. (3) The prices of rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, and flour will be based on the prices in Wuxi.

Also, Ye Yuecheng, Chairman of the Wuhu Miscellaneous Industries Association, and Wei Shaozheng, Chairman of the Hotel Industry Association, have been released.

Mingguang [Our Dispatch, 4th] After price controls were abandoned, most of the shops and vendors here have resumed business, and the market is gradually returning to normal. In addition, merchants in Zhangbaling Town, due to the prosperous local grain industry, and merchants from Shanghai, Wuxi, and other places buying grain, have specially requested and obtained approval from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau for the newly added special express train to stop when passing by, in order to facilitate travel.

### Returning from a Trip to the Southwest: Zhang Junmai Delivers a Speech; Deepest Impression is the Universal Desire for Reform

[Our Newspaper] Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the Social Democratic Party, flew back to this city from Chengdu on the 3rd. On the 4th, he met with reporters and spoke extensively about his impressions of his trip to the Southwest, saying that the situation in the southwestern provinces was much more stable than here, and that the most profound impression of this trip was that all places were eager for reform, otherwise the current situation would be difficult to maintain. Even within the Kuomintang itself, there was suffering and a desire for change. In terms of political reform, the most important thing is to revise the excessively centralized system, so that local areas can do things. This principle applies equally to military and party affairs. The pessimism of the current situation is a well-known fact. The President should have an even more thorough understanding upon his return from his northern inspection tour. As for American aid, it must be based on self-help in order to be effectively obtained, and there must be absolutely no dependence. The United States' policy toward China will be revised in the future, but whether it will become active or passive depends on whether the Chinese people are revitalized. It is generally understood that American aid to China will not exceed the scope of supplying arms and materials, and military aid will not be reversed to support volunteer forces. If the situation in our country continues to deteriorate, the United States will inevitably withdraw from North China and Qingdao, and its actions in South China will also be limited, because it will never be willing to engage in direct conflict with the Chinese Communist Party. Regardless of whether the Democratic or Republican Party comes to power, they will both follow the bipartisan foreign policy, which is essentially no different, because this is necessary to cope with the difficult situation in the world. It is expected that Truman will conduct negotiations with the Soviet Union after being re-elected, but whether the East-West deadlock can be broken will depend on the skills of the negotiators. The basic interests of the two countries do have areas of conflict, but they are not enough to resort to war. The war propaganda on both sides is very fierce, but in reality, it is another matter.

Zhang originally planned to go to Kunming, but the situation was urgent, so he returned to Shanghai early. He is now studying the current situation based on reports from within the party and said that he does not plan to go to Beijing in the short term.

### Truman Will Reorganize the Government, Accelerate the Export of Foreign Aid Military Supplies, and the Situation in China is Also Under Consideration; Marshall and Forrestal May Retire Next Year

[United Press, Washington, 4th] Due to Truman's election, the United States' plan to rearm Europe will be expanded. At the same time, seven senators and twelve representatives who opposed American foreign aid programs (including economic recovery or military aid) have been defeated. Therefore, it is generally expected that the administration will now accelerate the completion of the military defense alliance plan with Western Europe and accelerate the shipment of military supplies loaned to non-communist countries.

[Agence France-Presse, Independence City, Missouri, 4th] President Truman gave a radio address in his hometown on the evening of the 2nd, saying that after his election, he deeply understood the great responsibility for world peace and welfare. This election was not a victory for him personally, but a victory for the Democratic Party and the people. Truman offered a promise to the nation to realize the Democratic Party's platform announced during the election campaign and asked the nation to assist in this task.

[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] The main focus of President Truman's foreign policy after being re-elected will be one major question: to what extent is the United States willing and able to invest more money and resources in the Cold War against the Soviet Union? According to diplomatic authorities, Truman's answer to this question will largely depend on the scope and effectiveness of his entire anti-communist plan in his second term. The emergence of this question is related to the three major dangerous areas in the world: first, Western Europe wants to conclude a military alliance with the United States and lease military supplies. Military experts estimate that the cost will be more than two billion yuan per year. Second, in China, the United States is facing an urgent crisis as the National Government suffers military victories from the Communist Party. Third, in Greece, although American military aid has prevented the Communist guerrillas from controlling the entire country, it has also failed to eliminate them. The next session of the United States Congress may discuss a larger military aid program.

[United Press, Washington, 4th] President Truman returned to the White House from his hometown on the 4th to continue Roosevelt's traditional politics. Truman's new government is bound to implement the New Deal, increase taxes and discretionary spending, and the political line will target the middle class. The President will return to Washington on the 5th.

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] Truman, who was considered to be in dire straits, was surprisingly elected as President of the United States today, which is a major upset in American political history. The new government will appear with a new look. Secretary of State Marshall is planning to retire and is reportedly preparing to resign in February next year. Secretary of Defense Forrestal may also retire. Former Undersecretary of State Acheson is rumored to succeed Marshall as Secretary of State, and Republican leaders will undoubtedly be replaced. Dewey, who failed to win the election twice in ten years, stated that he was unwilling to try again, suggesting that he might withdraw from the political stage.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 3rd] Diplomatic circles believe that Truman may appoint Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Vinson, as the new Secretary of State to succeed Marshall. It is reported that Truman and Vinson's opinions are closer on foreign policy.

### US Two Parties Contend for Control of Congress; Republican Party Suffers Complete Defeat; House of Representatives Sharply Reduced by More Than One Hundred and Seventy Seats

[United Press, New York, 4th] The contrast of seats between the Democratic and Republican parties in the old and new Congresses is as follows:

New Congress (81st)

Democratic Party: Senate 54 seats
House of Representatives 257 seats

Republican Party: Senate 42 seats
House of Representatives 67 seats

Old Congress (80th) Increase/Decrease

Senate 45 seats Increase of 9 seats
House of Representatives 184 seats Increase of 73 seats

Senate 51 seats Decrease of 9 seats
House of Representatives 243 seats Decrease of 176 seats

In addition, the left-wing American Labor Party occupies one seat in the new House of Representatives, losing one seat compared to the old House of Representatives. There are six vacancies in the old House of Representatives. As of 7:00 AM Eastern Standard Time on the 4th, there are still ten seats in the House of Representatives that have not been determined, of which the Democratic Party is leading in five seats, and the Republican Party is also leading in five seats.

### New US Congressmen; Eight Women Elected

[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd, United Press] In this election, eight women were elected as members of the House of Representatives (four Democrats, four Republicans). There may be a total of nine female members in the 81st Congress, an increase of two from the previous session.

### Dewey Decides to Support Bipartisan Foreign Policy; Indicates That He Will No Longer Run for President

[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd] Dewey, the defeated Republican presidential candidate, walked the last mile of his journey on the American political stage this morning. In his farewell letter to the people, he urged continuous and vigorous support for President Truman's bipartisan foreign policy. Dewey held a special press conference at the Roosevelt Hotel, the same location where he first suffered defeat four years ago, stating that it is necessary to support the foreign policy established through cooperation between the Democratic and Republican parties after the war. He believes that the international situation is extremely urgent, and the world has encountered the darkest weekend due to the crises in China and Greece. Dewey is now completely detached from the national political stage and has announced that he will no longer run for president in the future. Dewey himself expressed surprise at this defeat but did not explain the reasons for Truman's victory.

### The United States' New Policy Toward China Depends on the New Foreign Affairs Committee; Truman Has Never Rejected Resolutions of This Committee

[United Press, Pittsburgh, 4th] Congressman Fulton, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told the United Press on the evening of the 3rd that the new policy toward China will be determined by the selection of four successors to the Foreign Affairs Committee by the Speaker of the House. He said: "The character of the four successors will have a significant impact on China. In the past, Truman has always accepted the judgment of the Foreign Affairs Committee and has never rejected any resolutions of the committee. Therefore, the future policy toward China depends more on the House Foreign Affairs Committee than on the President. Appropriations bills will be proposed by the House of Representatives, and the execution of policy is actually money. The new policy may be greatly influenced by the fact-finding trip of the bipartisan joint committee investigating Pacific policy, especially when Senator Barkley is a member of the committee. This travel plan was previously postponed due to the general election."

### Democratic Party Pleases Labor; Plans to Abolish Anti-Labor Law

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 4th] Reichans, the current chairman of the US House Labor Committee, announced on the evening of the 3rd that after the Democratic Party has won the election, it will restore workers' rights. He also stated that he would draft a new bill to abolish the Taft-Hartley Anti-Labor Act. This new bill will be submitted to the House of Representatives soon.

### Soviet Union Firmly Rejects American Plan for Controlling Atomic Energy; Vyshinsky Launches Counterattack at the General Assembly

[Associated Press, Paris, 4th] The UN General Assembly today discussed the majority party plan and the Soviet Union's plan passed by the Political Committee. Soviet Representative Vyshinsky spoke, refusing to accept the majority party plan and believing that an agreement could not be reached between the East and West on the atomic energy control plan, and that the Soviet Union's plan should be passed. US Representative Austin advocated passing the majority party plan yesterday. Vyshinsky's remarks today are the counterattack of the Soviet bloc.

[United Press, Paris, 3rd] US Representative Austin delivered a speech at the UN General Assembly today, stating that the unanimous vote of confidence in the United Nations for the United States' world atomic energy control plan will help bring the world closer to true atomic safety. He specifically endorsed a proposal in the draft resolution to be discussed by the General Assembly, namely that the five powers and Canada jointly consult. The purpose of these consultations will be to study whether there is a basis for agreement between the Soviet Union and Western countries on the issue of atomic energy. He said, "The United States hopes that these consultations should be of a high-level nature, with the main aim of exploring the reasons why the Soviet Union is currently unwilling or unable to cooperate with other countries in terms of the measures it deems necessary to maintain peace."

### American People Willing to Have a Slightly Left-Leaning Government; Perhaps It Was Truman's Ace

[Washington, 3rd] Political observers unanimously view Truman's unexpected victory as an indication that the American people are willing to have a slightly more left-leaning government. The entire tendency of Truman's election campaign was to move further to the left, especially because it had to compete with Wallace's slogans. The majority of the American people clearly fully agreed with this tendency.

### Various Reactions to Truman's Re-election as President

Britain and France Rejoice

[Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd] The British and French governments expressed satisfaction with Truman's re-election as president, as it is generally believed that this indicates that the American people hope to continue Roosevelt's New Deal, and the new American government will continue the Marshall Plan.

Soviet Union Indifferent

[United Press, Moscow, 3rd] The results of this American election are seen as just another victory for the reactionaries in the eyes of the Soviet Union. They believe that there is essentially no difference whether Truman or Dewey wins.

### The Tokyo Tribunal Acquits the Major Japanese War Criminals of Massacre and Atrocities; Only Conspiracy to Aggression is Used as a Basis for Judgment; Judge Webb Began Reading the Verdict Yesterday

[United Press, Tokyo, 4th] The Far East International Military Tribunal reconvened on the 4th and began reading the final verdicts for Tojo and the other 24 Japanese Class A war criminals. Out of the 55 counts of indictment, only 17 were read on the 4th. It is generally expected that the period for reading the verdict will last for at least one week to ten days.

The final prologue to this trial, which has lasted for two and a half years, was unveiled at 9:30 AM Tokyo time on the 4th in the former Japanese military headquarters building. Chief Justice Webb of Australia began reading the 1,800-page verdict of the eleven-nation tribunal in a firm and clear tone.

The preparation period for this verdict lasted for more than six months. The counts of indictment read on the 4th accused the defendants of planning, preparing, and launching wars of aggression, and conspiring to commit murder and mass killings. The courtroom was filled with Japanese and Allied observers. This extremely confidential verdict is divided into three chapters: the first chapter describes the general trial, including legal issues and the legal perspectives investigated by the court; the second chapter describes each defendant; and the third chapter includes the judgment and the announcement of the execution.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] The International Tribunal's final verdict this morning on the 25 Class A Japanese war crime suspects excluded 38 of the counts of indictment against the defendants, including the Nanjing Massacre and the atrocities of the Japanese army in China, and only used the conspiracy and war of aggression as their crimes. For technical reasons, the court only considered 17 of the original 55 counts of indictment in order to avoid repetition. The counts of indictment against Tojo and other defendants that the court canceled included the Nanjing Massacre and the atrocities of the Japanese army in Guangzhou, Hankou, Changsha, Hengyang, Guilin, Hong Kong, and other places. The final verdict stated that if the defendants are proven to have engaged in wars of aggression, then they are responsible for the illegal killings during the entire war. Some of the counts of indictment were repetitive, and some were alternating. The 17 actual crimes included the conspiracy and war of aggression against China. The final verdict did not address the accusations against the court's power to interrogate war crime suspects. The verdict stated, "The attacks on the court's power have completely failed." The final verdict is very long and is divided into three parts: history, jurisprudence, and conspiracy. The defendants' lawyers originally said that Japan's wars of aggression were merely discontinuous events, but the court considered it to be an entire conspiracy against peace. The International Tribunal reconvened after a six-week recess. The three defendants, namely Umezu Mijiro, Shira Toru Minoru, and Hiranuma Kiichiro, did not appear in court due to illness. Shiratori only has a cold and will be able to appear in court soon. The other defendants have not changed in appearance since their last appearance before June. They have been on trial for two years and seem to be deeply pleased to appear in court at this time. There were originally 28 Class A suspects, but only 25 remained to hear the final verdict after two years of trial. Former Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke and Admiral Nagano Osami have died of illness, and Okawa Shumei has gone mad.

### Mental Illness Has Been Cured; Okawa Writes Articles in Prison

[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 4th] Okawa Shumei suddenly went mad when the court first opened on May 3, 1946, covering his face and sobbing, and hitting Tojo's head with force. Therefore, the authorities sent him to the hospital for mental illness, and he has returned to normal after treatment. It is said that Okawa has recently been writing a research paper on Islam in prison and is very calm. (According to reports, Tokyo began announcing the Class A war criminals today, but Okawa is still in Yokohama).

### Trial Lasted Two and a Half Years; Cost Seven Million US Dollars

[New Asia Agency, Tokyo, 4th] According to the Associated Press, the trial of the Tokyo war criminals has lasted for two and a half years. If calculated in terms of money spent, it is approximately US$10,000 per day, which is about three times higher than the trial expenses for the German war criminals, with a total of US$7.5 million.

### Yang Chuoan Analyzes – Food Rationing Situation in Six Major Cities – Shortage Last Month – To Be Fully Allocated Around the 20th

[Our Dispatch] Yang Chuoan, chairman of the Emergency Food Procurement and Storage Committee, analyzed the rice supply situation in the six major cities to reporters yesterday, stating: Shanghai needs a total of 550,000 dan of rationed rice in October, of which 435,000 dan have arrived, leaving a shortage of 115,000 dan. After deducting the 7,000 dan of rationed rice for public educators, which can be allocated in cash, the actual shortage is only 108,000 dan, which is expected to arrive in full around the 20th of this month. In Nanjing, a total of 130,000 dan is needed in October, of which 115,000 dan have arrived, leaving a shortage of 15,000 dan, which can also be resolved around the 20th. Thanks to Chairman Song's efforts, Guangzhou has raised all the required amount locally. Tianjin and Beijing need 1.3 million bags of flour in October, which has also been fully raised, and 1 million bags have been transported. There is still a shortage of 300,000 bags, half of which are awaiting shipment, and the flour mills can deliver the remaining 150,000 bags before mid-month. Qingdao has no problem with food rationing in October. As for the price of rationed rice, there will be no changes in October, but November is difficult to say. Because the price of rationed rice is much lower than the market price, it all depends on government subsidies. The national treasury cannot bear the burden, and the purpose of rationing is to ensure that people receive the supply of materials, not as a form of relief. Therefore, some people advocate raising the price of rationed rice, while others advocate keeping the rationed price unchanged, fearing that raising the price of rice will affect the overall price level. Both sides have their points, and it remains to be discussed and decided in the future. Chairman Yang believes that the government-controlled areas are still self-sufficient in food, but the biggest problem at present is that farmers refuse to sell their rice because the income from selling rice is not enough to buy essential goods. After the abolition of price limits, procurement work has been smoother than before, but because the price of rice has risen sharply, the previously planned funds are insufficient for use. At present, the procurement area of the Food Procurement Committee is limited to the four provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi. Chairman Yang finally stated that the sources of food in the past were complex, with the China Trust Bureau, the American Aid Council, the China Relief Organization, and the Economic Cooperation Administration all providing food supplies. The proceeds from the sale of rice were deposited in the Central Bank and were not clearly marked, fearing confusion over time. Therefore, it has been decided to establish a Food Source and Fund Clearing Committee to start clearing them up.

### Community Bureau Did Not Order Rice Shops to Sell Stored Rice – Named Purchase Can Be Reported for Thorough Investigation

Several rice shops in this city published announcements in newspapers yesterday, stating: All customers' food rice purchased and not yet picked up in the past must be supplied to the store according to the authorities' orders, otherwise they will be punished for hoarding. Therefore, all stored rice has been sold at the limited price in the store, and customers are required to go to the store with their certificates to settle the payment within five days or one week. After the deadline, the balance will be deposited in the bank on their behalf to clear the procedures. Several rice shops also posted the above measures at the entrance, claiming that they were ordered by the "Community Bureau," etc. According to the director of the Social Affairs Bureau speaking to reporters: He has not heard anything about the process and handling methods of this matter. All civil disputes are handled by the competent authorities according to law. The Social Affairs Bureau has no right to overstep its authority. If any rice shop continues to use the name of the Social Affairs Bureau, the parties concerned can report to the police station and thoroughly investigate and pursue the matter according to law.

### Xuanhuai Steamer of China Merchants Bureau Sinks off Yingkou – More Than Twenty Crew Members Missing

### Retrial of Stock Dumping Case Concluded – Three Defendants Granted Bail – High Court Scheduled to Announce Judgment on the 11th of this Month

[Our Dispatch] In the stock dumping case involving the suspicion of leaking news of currency reform, the four defendants, Lin Legeng, Du Weiping, Tao Liguolan, and Xu Yangshuyao, were sentenced by the local court for violating the Exchange Law. Tao Liguolan was sentenced to ten months in prison, Lin and Du were each sentenced to eight months in prison, and Xu Yangshuyao was sentenced to seven months in prison. Except for Tao Liguolan, who gave up the appeal, the others did not accept the original judgment and appealed to the High Court. Xiao Xieirong, the presiding judge of the High Court, judges Feng Zhidong and Chen Zhensheng, held a collegial panel hearing yesterday morning, and prosecutor Qu Rong also attended the court to prosecute. Du Weiping stated: In name, I am the old Guan of Hongxing Securities, but all daily affairs are the responsibility of the manager Qiu Yunzhang. Because the import and export business of Huamei Trading Company could not be started, I also did not go, and at the same time, I was sick and did not ask about foreign affairs. As for the confession to the police station, I was only asked to sign at that time, and I was not given a detailed look, so it is not credible. Lin Legeng stated: Although Qiu Yunzhang had talked to me about buying and selling Yongsha at that time, I did not accept the buying and selling behavior. Even if it is considered inappropriate, it is an incomplete act. Xu Yangshuyao stated: It was my first time buying and selling stocks. I was completely delighted to see the opportunity and tried it by chance. I didn't know what was inside or outside the market, and I had no criminal intent. After the defense lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Yu Chengxiu, and Yu Zhongluo defended the defendants, and applied for bail, the court ordered that the judgment be announced on the morning of the 11th. Du and Lin each paid 5,000 yuan in cash and a shop guarantee, and Xu and Yangshuyao paid 2,000 yuan in cash and a shop guarantee, and were allowed to be released on bail pending trial.

The case still needs to be further investigated before it can be verified.

### 40,000 Pots of Famous Varieties – Participate in the Chrysanthemum Exhibition – Unique Romance of Appreciating Flowers in the Mist

[Our Dispatch] The 37th Chrysanthemum Exhibition organized by the Municipal Garden Management Office has been officially scheduled to open on the 6th. Fuxing Park was not open for the past two days for arrangement and organization. All displays can be completed by noon today, and a preview will be held for all sectors of society at 3:00 PM this afternoon. The internal and external design of this exhibition is exceptionally elegant. At the entrance, there is a large oil painting of yellow chrysanthemums by the famous sculptor Liu Kaiqu. The original fountain in the park has been raised, and the surrounding area is filled with famous chrysanthemums. The horizontal plaque is inscribed with the four characters "Appreciating Chrysanthemums in the Mist." The atmosphere of evaluation and appreciation in the misty atmosphere is indeed unique. The layout of the venue is simple and majestic. In order to prevent the audience from gathering in one place, the association has specially classified and displayed the famous varieties of chrysanthemums. For example, those belonging to the various nurseries directly under the management office include five categories classified according to morphology: single-stem, grafted, three-stem, cliff chrysanthemum, and pagoda chrysanthemum. There are eleven categories classified according to variety: fragrant chrysanthemum, flying dance chrysanthemum, back curl chrysanthemum, supporting cinnamon chrysanthemum, aster chrysanthemum, hair chrysanthemum, Meng chrysanthemum, Yunzuo chrysanthemum, Gui Meng chrysanthemum, Yun Meng chrysanthemum, and single petal chrysanthemum. Including those participating in various groups, the total number is about 40,000 pots. Famous flower nurseries in this city, such as Guo Lingshuang's Heng Garden, Huang Yueyuan's Huang Garden, Zhang Lianting's Ming Garden, as well as the two road bureaus, various private farms, and members of the Flower and Tree Industry Association, have sent famous chrysanthemums to participate in the exhibition. The association has also specially opened a competition section, dividing them into three categories: single-stem, three-stem, and standing chrysanthemum, numbered. After the public exhibition, the association will invite artists, horticultural professors from various universities, and flower lovers in the community to freely evaluate them. According to the association: Ticket offices are being added recently, and the ticket price is set at 2 jiao. The more spectacular aspects of this year's chrysanthemum exhibition compared to last year are that the varieties have increased to nearly 500, and there is a pot of standing chrysanthemums with 169 flower heads, which are extremely precious. (The attached picture is a pot of standing chrysanthemums, the Nanyang Dabai, with a total of 127 flowers. Our newspaper took the photo)

### China Petroleum Company Explains the Situation of Kerosene Rationing for Public Educators

The Resources Committee of China Petroleum Company issued the following statement due to rumors that the price of kerosene rationing for public educators in Shanghai was being adjusted. (1) Our company has been rationing kerosene to public educators in installments. This period is scheduled to begin on November 4. Before November 4, no oil payments had been received at all, so there was no need to make up the price. As for the kerosene distributed in the previous period (September), all payments have been collected and the goods have been delivered, so there is no reason to collect the price supplement. (2) The price of kerosene in Shanghai, as previously stipulated by the Executive Yuan, is 5 jiao 6 fen of Jinyuan coupons per kilogram for bulk delivery at the Pudong oil depot. In order to promote domestic products and give preferential treatment to users, our company only calculates it at 90%, and the actual charge is 5 jiao of Jinyuan coupons per kilogram. The price for this period is the same as the price for the previous period, and there is no increase. (3) The cost of Shengshan empty cans has increased sharply in this period, so it has been discussed and decided by major oil companies to make appropriate increases. All companies calculate it at 4 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen of Jinyuan coupons per can, which is not a separate regulation of our company. In fact, this empty can can still be used for other purposes after the kerosene is used up, and its value is even higher than the price set by our company. Therefore, it does not seem that users will suffer losses. And if users think the price of the empty can is too high, they can switch to bulk delivery and bring their own containers to pick it up.

### Scarce Goods in Production Areas Make Procurement Difficult: Rice Market Arrivals Not Robust; Superior White Keng, Bo Dao, and Du Xian Rice All Priced at 100 Yuan

Rice trading has come to a standstill due to the scarcity of arrivals. 969 shi of rice arrived in the South Market, and the Chamber of Commerce decided that superior white Keng, Bo Dao, and Du Xian rice would each be priced at 100 yuan. 100 shi of white Keng rice arrived in the North Market, with medium-grade rice priced at 90 yuan. However, supply is far less than demand, making it difficult for rice shops to purchase, and the shortage of goods in the market is quite severe. The reason for the sluggish arrivals is the scarcity of goods in the production areas, making procurement difficult.

Flour: Price negotiations have not been approved, and the market has no goods for trading, remaining suspended. Under the table, unbranded No. 2 flour is priced at 45 yuan, up another 5 yuan. Retail is experiencing severe shortages. Bran is in short supply and high demand, with prices rising alarmingly, soaring 8 yuan to 43 yuan per large bag.

Grains: Prices are soaring. Soybean arrivals are scarce. Shops on this street are diligently searching for goods. Poyang soybeans are 70 yuan, up another 10 yuan. Corn and red sorghum are being acquired by northern merchants and distilleries, with each rising 6-7 yuan. Tianjin sesame seeds are actively being traded, rising 20%. Raw peanuts surged 40 yuan.

Cooking Oil: No goods are available on the market. The 3,100 dan of cooking oil supplied by the factory yesterday is scheduled for payment today, so it was temporarily suspended yesterday. However, due to high raw material prices, soybean oil costs more than 300 yuan, making it difficult to supply in large quantities. Soybean cake is being sought after by merchants, rising 8 yuan to 33 yuan.

### Tight Credit Situation Intensifies

Money Lenders Request Adjustment of Deposit Interest Rates

Yesterday (4th), the tight credit situation intensified. Underground interest rates soared to 23-25 yuan per thousand yuan for overnight loans, yet it was still difficult to obtain credit. Although money lender deposit interest rates have been increased, they are still five times lower than underground interest rates. It is reported that a request will be submitted to the Gold Control Bureau in the coming days for another increase.

### Gold Control Bureau Inspection: Various Deficient Private Banks

[Report from our newspaper] In the past two months, due to the easy credit situation in Shanghai, private banks released a significant amount of funds. However, recently, due to the sudden tightening of credit, the funds released have not been recovered, and some private banks are facing a potential liquidity crisis. To understand the true situation, the Gold Control Bureau dispatched a large number of auditors to various private banks for inspection yesterday. Furthermore, the authorities are closely monitoring the increasing number of remittances from other cities to Shanghai.

### Sugar Awaiting Price Negotiations

There was still no market for sugar in the market yesterday. The Chamber of Commerce is waiting for price negotiations and prohibits members from trading within the market. However, due to the partial opening of other commodities, people in the industry are quite active. Although trading is not allowed in the market, the demand outside the market is exceptionally strong. Furthermore, due to the intense competition among citizens to purchase from street retailers during the price-controlled period, many stockpiles have been sold off. Those with multiple orders are eager to replenish their stocks, resulting in demand exceeding supply and chaotic price quotations.

### Second Estimate of National Cotton Production This Year Released

Approximately 5.3% Lower Than First Estimate

Ginned Cotton Amount: 10,727,000 dan, a decrease of 605,000 dan, or approximately 5.3%, compared to the first estimate of 11,332,000 dan this year.

### Silk Prices Rising

The Artificial Silk Association is temporarily unwilling to resume trading due to the chaotic price quotations for various commodities. Outside the market, traders are quoting prices of 6,000 yuan for 120 Tianqiao Bright New Goods and 6,200 yuan for Dongyang goods.

Raw silk exports are difficult to expand, and foreign firms are mostly observing. D-grade 78 evenness silk is quoted at 7,000 yuan, and premium grade silk is quoted at 6,800 yuan. Nothing was heard of other grades.

Although there is no formal trading in silk fabrics, brokers are quoting very high prices. Huaqiang Dacheng bedding is quoted at 3,200-3,300 yuan.

### Business Briefs

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting permission for private banks to refund the increased capital in cash immediately after the capital verification procedures are completed, so as to facilitate turnover for industry and commerce.

According to the Export-Import Control Committee, as of now, there have been more than 30 applications for importing goods that have already been paid for and ordered from abroad. All of them are requesting to import materials from Appendix II and Appendix III A and Appendix III B, while very few are applying to import production equipment from Appendix I. The committee has approved seven cases, all of which are industrial raw materials. The remaining 20 cases have not been approved due to incomplete documents.

### High Demand from Merchant Traders and Manufacturers: Yarn and Cloth Prices Strong

Yesterday, the China Textile Corporation opened cloth as usual, pricing 12-pound 20-count AB extra-fine cloth at 62.5 yuan, limited to (retail dye factories) for purchase, and American cloth 014-17 thread poplin at 4.3 yuan per meter, limited to (retail) for purchase. The cotton cloth market has not yet resumed trading, but trading outside the market is surprisingly brisk. Because cloth shops in various places have depleted their stocks in the buying spree, merchant traders are in high demand. Yesterday, merchants from Hankou and Guangdong were actively searching for goods, and many from northern merchants and along the Beijing-Hangzhou line also came to Shanghai to purchase. Recently, the China Textile Corporation has not distributed much supply in Shanghai, and factories are still restricting the opening of goods due to the inadequate supply of raw materials. Those with goods are observing and selling less, so the market is very strong. It is reported that the asking price for Longtou fine cloth has risen from 140 yuan to 150 yuan, and some people are buying it, but not many transactions are being made. Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge is quoted at 155 yuan. Cloth shops on this street have difficulty selling and replenishing stocks because the negotiated price is too far from the asking price, so retail shops are still closed. Also, it is reported that the authorities are still cracking down on illegal price increases in cotton cloth trading outside the market. It is heard that three or four brokers were interfered with at the Leyuan tea party.

The cotton yarn market is experiencing strong demand from merchants everywhere, but the supply of goods from various yarn mills and yarn merchants is very scarce, leading to a 20-30% increase in the asking price for various yarns. Replicating manufacturers are buying goods immediately upon seeing them. Fine yarn 42-count blue is priced as high as 5,700-5,800 yuan, and there are buyers. 32-count Silver Moon is 4,400 yuan, 20-count Jincheng is 3,400-3,600 yuan, and 71-count Shuangma is 3,600 yuan. The asking price for coarse yarn, 16-count, 12-count, 8-count, large-count, etc., is chaotic and inconsistent.

### Northeast Wind Departs with a Final Flourish: 3-1 Victory Over Zhichao; Impressive Performance by the Visiting Team, Unexpected Defeat for the Allied Forces

[Report from our newspaper] The Northeast Wind football team came to Shanghai and tied all three games, drawing with the Railway, Qingbai, and China Aviation teams one after another. Yesterday afternoon, in the fourth game, it departed with a final flourish and finally showed its might, defeating the local powerhouse Zhichao team, a combination of Chinese and Western players, 3-1. In the first half, Northeast Wind took the lead with a score of 2-0. Although yesterday was not a weekend or holiday, the Yiyuan stadium was packed with over 7,000 fans. Northeast Wind's appeal has never waned.

Zhichao was ambitious and determined to win. The forwards included the famous international player "Little Yellow Hair" Robert Stoff and the Soviet players Novgorolov and Grinas, with Tie Funi in the middle and the general Wu Qixiang in the back. Yesterday, the entire team was disconnected. The forwards lacked tacit understanding and did not coordinate with the defenders. It was a disorganized mess, the midfield was disconnected, and Wu Qixiang never played a role. Northeast Wind pinned down the entire team, so the team's vitality was shut down and helpless. Northeast Wind played with increasing energy, especially with the strict defense of the defenders and the stability of the goalkeeper, and finally won. Yesterday's victory, I would say, was won by good defense. It was truly Northeast Wind's first masterpiece.

Zhichao kicked off. After 12 minutes of engagement, Northeast Wind's Chen Dong shot from 20 yards out. Sheng Peter actually caught it and lost it, slipping into the net. Northeast Wind created the first goal record. After another 10 minutes, Tie Funi lost his footing. Guo Hongbin made a solo charge and shot the ball into the Zhichao crossbar and into the net. Northeast Wind scored two consecutive goals, and its momentum was greatly boosted. The first half ended 2-0. At the beginning of the second half, Zhichao was determined to counterattack and took fierce offensive action. The forwards had several brilliant performances, and there were cheers from the stands, but unfortunately, it was a failure, and the offensive became a thing of the past. After 30 minutes, Zhichao's defeat seemed to be a foregone conclusion. At this time, Yu Qiaxing slammed into Chen Qin and committed another penalty. Zhang Jiliang took the penalty kick, and although Sheng Peter patted it, he failed to save it. Northeast Wind scored three straight goals and won. After another seven minutes, Northeast Wind's Wang Chengxian also committed a handball. Grinas kicked the penalty, but it was saved by Yan Chengkuan. Until the last five minutes, due to Yan Chengkuan's rush, Grinas kicked the ball in, and Zhichao was able to save a goal, finishing 3-1 and avoiding a shutout.

### After the Price Limit Was Lifted

— Lei Ting

The price limit has been lifted and replaced by reasonable adjustments. This change will eliminate the buying sprees of the past half-month and the strange phenomenon of nine out of ten shops being empty. To say nothing else, the tense emotions have been slightly relaxed, and it is not unpleasant to have a clear view.

Is the price limit of August 19th a success or a crime? Let's not talk about that for now. It seems to be of no avail even if we talk about it. However, when I think of adjustments, those of us "private teachers" and other salaried people can't help but feel a little chilled, and the relaxed emotions immediately become tense again.

For the past three years, the term "adjustment" has become a terrifying shadow in the minds of the general public (of course, the rich can be indifferent, and hoarders will regard it as "good news," but these are only a small number of exceptions). Because adjustment is just another name for price increase. Most of the people have become startled birds, so naturally they will be alarmed by everything, and how can we bear to mock their cowardice? Although this time the adjustment has been given a rather pleasing "reasonable" qualification, and the citizens can be less anxious, how many of the past adjustments were not approved by the government before becoming legal procedures? Just think: if it's unreasonable, how can it be "approved"? If it's unreasonable, how can it be "legal"?? However, the survivors who were fortunate enough not to die from the enemy's ravages and the communist bandits' trampling have already been crushed by repeated "reasonable" actions.

The above remarks are not to say that the price limit should not be lifted, nor to say that the buying spree should be allowed to spread, nor to say that adjustments do not need to be reasonable; but to say: how should the authorities make natural price limits replace artificial price limits in this reform? How should the "reason" of reasonable adjustment become the "reason" that the majority of the people seek day and night? In a word, to balance the supply of materials, the price will be limited without being limited; to balance the income and expenditure of the people, even if the price rises, it will not threaten their minimum standard of living. To say it again: manufacturers should produce and sell reasonably, and the people should live reasonably.

Of course, it is not difficult to say it, but it is difficult to do it. It is naturally easy to write two reasonable words. However, living is a right of human beings, and seeking to live is even more a right of human beings. The authorities naturally cannot ignore it or remain indifferent because it is "difficult," nor can they be biased because it is "difficult," because this is an extremely serious social problem.

Based on past experiences in adjusting prices, the cost-of-living index is the only way to balance salaried people. Whether this method will be adopted again is currently unknown. However, even when it was adopted, it was full of flaws. First, it does not keep up with prices. Second, it often unconsciously becomes one of the factors promoting prices. Third, it has a certain range, and this range is too small—for example, public education personnel have the right to enjoy the cost of living index, while "private education personnel" have to wait for half a year, even if your income in the last two months is only enough to drink plain water, no one cares. (This is just an example.) If this time the adjustment of the treatment of public education personnel is still "as before," then there is a problem with this "reason."

Writing this, it makes people think of the "heroes" who went on a buying spree. Buying sprees are wrong and illegal; of course, not going on a buying spree is right and lawful. However, once the price is adjusted, even if it is a very reasonable adjustment, the rise is still a fact. When prices rise, isn't it still the "heroes" who went on a buying spree who benefit? Those who follow the right path lose out everywhere and lag behind in everything, while those who do not follow the right path often take advantage of everything; what kind of "reason" is this?

Of course, others can refute you. Because "in the face of extraordinary changes, there must be extraordinary talents." Conversely, those who made fortunes from national disasters, victory fortunes, and "impossible to operate" fortunes in the past were of course extraordinary talents. Even the easiest buying spree requires the conditions of being alert and agile. Accordingly, those of us who have nothing to live on or are about to have nothing to live on, in addition to regretting and being sad, can only blame ourselves for not having a sharp head, a thick face, a cruel heart, or a ruthless hand, and for being a born numb embryo. Thinking this way, it seems very "reasonable."

In this way, "reason" seems to be a thoroughfare that leads in all directions, at least it is today. However, the common people can no longer tolerate the "reason" of the public having their reason and the mothers-in-law having their reason.

I hope that this time the reasonableness is truly reasonable, or at least comparatively reasonable!

### Speaking of Dreams

— Fei Yu

We often dream at night. There are only two reasons for dreaming: one is "you think of something during the day, you dream of it at night," which means that the dream is the fulfillment of daytime desires, such as a miser dreaming of gold bars, a glutton dreaming of fish and meat, and a lecher dreaming of women. The second is "you feel something at night, so you dream," which means that the dream is an interpretation of the feeling when sleeping, such as feeling stuffy when your hand is pressed against your chest, so you dream of running and panting; such as feeling cold when your body is exposed outside the quilt, so you dream of falling into the water and swimming; such as feeling pain in a certain part of your body, so you dream of fighting and getting injured.

In the past, people thought that dream omens were mysterious and incredible, but they are actually easy to explain. Someone dreamed that a distant relative or friend had died, and the dream came true, so they thought it was "soul travel." In fact, we always suspect that something has happened to him because we haven't heard from him for a long time during the day, so we have such a dream at night. And the reason why this relative or friend didn't send a letter is mostly because they were sick or had an accident. This is a very natural coincidence and there is nothing mysterious about it.

There are also people who dream that thieves broke into the house, and after waking up in shock, they found that they had actually been robbed. This is because we hear the sound of thieves entering the house when we are sleeping, so we guess: "What is this sound? Maybe there are thieves." So we dream of thieves, and it is not surprising to say it clearly.

There is a Chinese folk tale about a person who had a dream while cooking yellow millet. In the dream, he lived a life of wealth and honor, and when he woke up, the yellow millet was not yet cooked. The author knows of a dream that is comparable to it. One night, an American businessman in San Francisco had a strange dream. He dreamed that he had killed someone. After the incident, the police came to arrest him, so he fled to New York by plane. The detectives tracked him down, so he went from New York to Canada, then to Holland, and then to France. He suffered all kinds of hardships along the way, but the detectives were still chasing him closely. Finally, his money ran out, and he was surrounded by detectives in a small hotel. He risked jumping out of the window, fled into a forest, and was exhausted in the forest and finally caught. Then he was escorted back to San Francisco for trial. He was sentenced to death and refused to accept it, so he hired a lawyer to appeal. He appealed three times, but all failed, and finally the death sentence was fixed. On the day of the execution, he was put on the guillotine. At that time, crowds gathered, and he saw his relatives and friends were all there. He knew that death was imminent and was very sad. Just then, the guillotine had struck his neck. He woke up in shock. There was something on his neck, but it was not a knife, but a small coat hanger that had fallen on his neck. When he felt something hitting his neck while sleeping, he thought, "Maybe I'm going to be beheaded." Why would he be beheaded? It must be because he committed a crime, so he fled, chased, and appealed, and everything came into his dream. It takes at least 20-30 minutes for yellow millet to cook, but it takes only a few seconds from the time the coat hanger falls to the time he wakes up in shock. To have such a long dream in such a short period of time can be said to be unique and more strange than the Chinese Yellow Millet Dream.

### East Scale, West Claw

— Xian Si

Since the end of the war, the German Navy shipyard in Hamburg has been converting German naval mines into "iron lungs" to help patients breathe.

When Hollywood produces snow scene movies, they often use flour instead of snow. From this year on, it has been decided to use other substitutes (such as liquid fire extinguishers in the surplus materials of the navy, which look like snow when sprayed). It is said that this can save 300 tons of flour this year for European aid.

The United States also has inflation after the war. The prices that have risen the most are food, followed by clothing, followed by furniture, and finally rent.

### Local Scenes

— Wen Zhaotong

Whenever I feel a void in my life, I want to take a trip back to my hometown, for my hometown will give me warmth and fill my life.

My hometown is on the great plains of Jiangnan. The goose-yellow rice paddies glitter with golden light under the autumn sun, clearly showing signs of a good harvest. However, if you go to the small town, you will see long lines at the rice mills, hear that rice is valuable but unavailable, and see an old woman weeping because she has had nothing to eat for three days…

Suppose you look at it from another angle: more people are visiting Yu Mountain than in previous years, and those who go to Wang Si Restaurant to taste the oil chicken often find themselves without a seat. Cars and the "climbing tiger" (the vine bridge for mountain climbing) never stop coming. The teahouses in the park are full. These scenes, however, show the peace and comfort of my hometown.

But if you look into the various shops in the streets and alleys, the phrase "nine out of ten are empty" is not an exaggeration. Not to mention that daily necessities such as soap and matches are not easy to buy, even blue ink for writing has become scarce.

It is already the time when the new grain is on the market. My hometown is a rice-producing area. It's not that there is no rice, but the hardworking farmers are reluctant to sell the rice casually because they want to exchange a shi of rice for a box of "Gu Ben" brand soap. They really feel that they cannot buy soap even if they have money.

This is a contradictory phenomenon, and it is also the sorrow and fear of the times. This time, when I went to my hometown, my hometown made me feel even more empty.

### On Works About the History of the Great War

— Chu Yukun

The Second World War was a catastrophe for mankind. After the war, people were determined to learn from the pain, and all hoped that this war would be the last war for mankind. However, before the bloodstains of the previous war had dried, a third world war was brewing. Whether in Europe or Asia, there are rumors of war everywhere, which is truly a misfortune for mankind. In today's depressed global atmosphere, reading books about the Second World War feels particularly meaningful.

In the American publishing industry, works on the Second World War have been published one after another since the war, and there are already piles of them. Even in China, where publications are scarce, dozens of them have been published. My own book, "History of the Second World War," has even sold 50,000 copies. However, in the British publishing industry, they are rarely seen. Recently, the British Cultural Commission sent a copy of "A Brief History of the Great War," which was recently published by Methuen Publishing House in London. The author, Mr. Falls, is a professor of war history at Oxford University. During the war, he served as a military reporter for the London Times, interviewing military news not only under gunfire but also broadcasting war news to the world on the BBC every day.

The book is only three hundred pages long and sells for fifteen shillings. It is divided into thirty chapters, which concisely and succinctly describe the course of the war. Because the author has sixteen years of experience in studying "war history," he is quite capable of organizing the complicated war history in an orderly manner. Moreover, where it should be detailed, it is particularly detailed; where it should be brief, it is particularly brief; it can be said to be "just right." It is a rare masterpiece in the history of the Great War, and it is suitable for the general public to read, so I earnestly recommend it to readers.

However, this book also has its shortcomings. Precisely because Falls is a specialist in war history, he only sees the progress of the war and only knows the shifts in the battle lines. He neglects the political and economic background, so it does not make any important contribution to scholars who study international politics.

### Four-Character Verse

— Xia Quchan

The song is not over, the oath is easily cold; I fear hearing the sound of a broken homeland, and again the voice of wealth does not return.

Late at night in the boudoir dream, it is difficult to wake up, difficult to get drunk; how can I bear to control my tears and watch the great event, already a lonely actor for ten years.

### Washing Brook Silk

A shallow fate matches a jade cup, I force myself to hold it with all my whiteness, and a hidden meaning is known by the small lamp through eye contact.

Holding the silk sleeves again is like a dream, looking closely at the dark eyebrows, it certainly can make poetry, how can there be a time to sober up in the human world.

### Donkey Meat

In the old capital, where meat is ubiquitous and no meal is without meat, apart from large livestock such as pigs, cattle, and sheep, there is also a type of "donkey meat," which has always been disdained by those of the middle class. Even those who carry vegetables in the urban core would rather eat pig head meat, sheep offal, and beef tendons than taste donkey meat. Only the laboring people inside and outside the countryside like it a lot, so there has always been this industry, and the business is also prosperous, but it does not enter the "hall of minor elegance" (not to mention the hall of major elegance).

Recently, due to the shortage and high price of pork, beef, and mutton, donkey meat suddenly became a best-seller due to the needs of the times. In the streets and alleys, there are often those who straddle small wooden boxes and shout loudly to sell, or set up stalls in the bustling city. Not only do ordinary people flock to it, but even gentry men and women also patronize, using it to get through the meat shortage. In the past, the price was disproportionate to the three livestock. For example, before the war, pork was priced at three jiao per jin, beef was two jiao, and donkey meat was only twenty copper coins (about four cents). Now, braised donkey meat costs four yuan and eight jiao per jin (gold yuan) – three mao per liang (900,000 yuan in legal tender). (Fresh pork is about one yuan per liang, and braised beef is five or six mao per liang.)

The method of making braised donkey meat is the same as that of beef and mutton, using soy sauce and spices to stew until tender. Its color is reddish-purple, very similar to beef, but the meat is coarser and cannot be passed off as beef (camel meat is similar to beef, and unscrupulous merchants occasionally use it to mix and sell). According to those who buy and eat it, its taste is no less delicious than beef, and it is not as inferior as people generally imagine. It is also said that people in the Northwest like donkey meat. I once saw an old sheng actor in a Qinqiang opera troupe whose stage name was "Donkey Meat Red," which shows a glimpse of the local customs of the West.

Human preferences for meat vary from place to place and also change with the times. For example, "Yan City Slaughtering Dogs" represents the ancient heroes who are generous and sad, but in modern times, dog meat is rarely heard of. Even today in Yan City (Beijing), dog meat is only secretly slaughtered and eaten by some local people with special preferences, which is not as openly traded as donkey meat. During the period of occupation, the Japanese especially liked it and ordered officials of the puppet organization to search and arrest dogs on their behalf. All the stray dogs in the streets and alleys were caught, and even those raised by families, if they happened to go out, often disappeared. As a result, every family was looking for their dogs and complaining to the police station. The police station then ordered each family to buy copper tags and hang them on their dogs' necks for identification. These tags were made and sold by the puppet government, which was another source of income! The Japanese said that eating dog meat is an ancient custom, and that their people value death and love martial arts. It turns out that "bushido" has such a relationship with eating dog meat! Is this also a facet of "Wearing the garments and caps of the Tang world, the rites and music of the Han lord"?

In the novel *Water Margin*, many heroes of Liangshan are big "meat eaters," either eating cooked geese or fat cattle. Nowadays, people mention "chicken and duck" together, but *Water Margin* has chicken and goose but no duck, because at that time "duck" was a derogatory term (like scolding people with "turtle" later), so they avoided using duck and used goose instead, but it was actually duck. As for eating a lot of beef and slaughtering pigs and sheep, that was generally the case for the outlaws and villagers. In the old days, the official government strictly prohibited the private slaughter of plowing cattle because "cattle plow the fields" and are meritorious to agriculture and relied upon by the people for food. And people advised each other not to kill dogs because "dogs guard the night" and are meritorious to the family and loyal to the owner. These two things both have ethical concepts of respecting virtue and repaying kindness between humans and animals, which is different from the Buddhist's universal prohibition of killing.

Guangdong has "Dragon Tiger Feast," which is made with cats and snakes and is an extremely precious grand feast. There are many Cantonese restaurants in the North, but it has never been seen on the menu. Because Northerners mention eating cats and snakes, they are horrified and change color, and even if it were prepared, no one would patronize it. The difference in preferences, the changes between ancient and modern times, and the North and South, is truly "hard to put into words."
