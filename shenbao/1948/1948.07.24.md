### Budget Legislation Completed; Total Amount Over 9 Trillion Yuan; Revenue Portion Increased, Expenditures Slightly Reduced

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The central government's general budget for the latter half of the 37th year, the special budget, and its implementing regulations, after three weeks of deliberation by the Legislative Yuan, were completed on the 23rd. It is understood that the revenue portion has been significantly increased compared to the originally listed figures, and the total budget amount has reached a considerable balance, approximately over 9 trillion yuan. The Legislative Yuan held its sixth closed-door meeting on the 23rd to continue discussing the general budget. Four hundred members attended, with President Sun attending and presiding over the meeting despite illness. In the morning, they first discussed the budget report of the Budget Committee, the six small groups, and the Education and Culture Committee, jointly re-examining the budget of the education sector. It was passed with slight revisions based on the original examination opinions. The main points were that after the various subjects of the general budget were transferred to the special budget, the funds less than 15% should be supplemented from the items reduced from other subjects in the second reserve fund of the general budget, and 30% should be allocated to basic education subsidies, 30% to teaching equipment expenses for public and private colleges and universities, 30% to subsidize education expenses in pacification zones, and 10% to revolutionary merit families and war of resistance/pacification merit families education expenses.

The budget for the transportation sector was largely passed according to the examination opinions: (1) The general budget and special budget expenses shall be temporarily approved according to the original plan. (2) The Shanghai Port Reorganization Committee was originally a temporary organization before the establishment of the Port Authority, with a complex system, inconsistent powers, and the original reorganization period had long expired. Although it was approved to continue for another year, it will soon expire. The committee should be terminated immediately, and the Ministry of Transportation should quickly establish the Shanghai Port Authority to take sole responsibility and unify powers. (3) Railway and highway engineering management fees should not exceed 30% of their engineering costs in principle. (4) The various state-owned enterprises under the Ministry of Transportation are large in scale and should be reduced. The personnel treatment is inconsistent. For example, the treatment of personnel in the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, China and Central Airlines, the Postal Remittances Bureau, and the Jinghu Railway Bureau is particularly high compared to the treatment of personnel in other state-owned enterprises under the ministry, and should be corrected in accordance with the government's general treatment methods for state-owned enterprise personnel.

Military grain purchases should be paid at market prices within half a month, and the procurement agencies should be unified to improve the effectiveness of levies and purchases to reduce the burden on the people. (6) In areas where transportation is difficult and rice is not easily transferred, taxes should be levied in legal tender, and the land tax agencies should be simplified. (7) The grain distribution in the five major cities should be half US grain and half domestic grain, and should be extended to other cities as appropriate. In the health department, it was decided that attention should also be paid to the expenses of traditional Chinese medicine in the second half of the year. The budgets of other agencies in charge, such as the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, the Resources Commission, the Directorate-General of Budget, and the Ministry of Audit, were all passed according to the examination opinions. In addition, the items listed in the general budget: (1) Debt expenditure, (2) Retirement and compensation expenditure for civil servants, (3) Provincial and municipal subsidies, and (4) The second reserve fund were also passed. As for the construction fee of 3 trillion yuan for the central government civil servant dormitories, it was decided that the Executive Yuan should coordinate the matter instead of allocating it to various agencies to ensure speed and effectiveness. Subsequently, it was decided to incorporate the points for attention on the implementation of the general budget proposed by Jian Gongsan and others into the general report for reference, and the meeting adjourned at half past twelve. The meeting continued at 3:00 PM to discuss the revenue portion of the general budget and the implementing regulations, which were amended and passed according to the examination opinions.

Li Hongru, Hu Zhongwu, Luo Shaowu, and others all made passionate speeches, advocating for the convening of a provisional National Assembly to amend the constitution, but did not advocate for deciding the date. At the time when the debate at the meeting was boiling and there was no consensus, National Assembly member Tian Suixiang overcame all opposition and advocated not to use the convening of the National Assembly as a weapon to scare people in order to achieve the purpose of fighting for treatment.

### US Aid Material Utilization Aimed at All People; Grain Distribution Decided to Be Close to Market Price to Recover Legal Tender

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The Executive Yuan's US Aid Utilization Committee invited personnel from the China branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration to hold the second joint discussion meeting at the Executive Yuan No. 1 official residence at 3:00 PM on the 23rd.

In addition to Wu Guozhen, Zhang Jia'ao, and Bei Zuyi, the members of the US Aid Utilization Committee, Vice Chairman Yu Hongjun, members Wang Yunwu, Yu Dawei, Wang Shijie, and Yan Jiagan all attended. Minister of Food Guan Jiyu and Deputy Minister of Finance Xu Boyuan attended the meeting. Those present from the US Economic Cooperation Administration China Branch included Lapham, Kilpatrick, Stillman, and others. The meeting discussed the policies and details of US aid utilization. The US Aid Utilization Committee reported on the opinions of the US aid four small groups recently established in Shanghai regarding the utilization of four materials: grain, cotton, petroleum, and fertilizer. After four hours of heated discussion, both parties expressed their agreement. However, the US side still needs to report to Hoffman before a final decision can be made. The policies for the utilization of US aid grain, cotton, petroleum, and fertilizer are described separately as follows: (1) Grain: continue to extend the work of the American Relief Mission and the Executive Yuan's US Aid Material Processing Committee to continue grain distribution. All the grain in US aid will be used for distribution. At the same time, the Ministry of Food will also raise its own grain supply. When distributing US aid grain, the price will be close to the market price in principle, and the past methods will still be used. It is hoped that it will be effectively implemented. For the poor who cannot afford to buy, another method will be formulated or it will be distributed at half price. (2) Cotton: adopt the principle of exchanging cotton for yarn and exchanging yarn for cloth. 50% will be sold in the domestic market to meet people's livelihood needs and stabilize yarn prices. 50% will be sold in the foreign market to exchange for foreign exchange to be used to purchase cotton. The specific method of utilization will be discussed by the Cotton Subcommittee. (3) Petroleum: still be handled by the original petroleum management agency, and distributed to the petroleum importers for sale. The petroleum in the seventh quarter quota will be cancelled to save foreign exchange. (4) Fertilizer: it was decided to use it for exchanging rice. The fertilizer exchanged out must still be used to increase production. The rice exchange method will be determined by the subcommittee. The small groups for processing US aid materials were established in Shanghai last week and held their first meetings. Personnel from both the US and China and relevant agencies participated. The Cotton Subcommittee was convened by Shen Jui, the Grain Subcommittee was convened by Yang Chuo'an, the Petroleum Subcommittee was convened by Zhou Shunxin, and the Fertilizer Subcommittee was convened by Wang Nianzu. It was decided that the industrial part would be used within the scope of the economic construction special funds. At yesterday's meeting, both parties unanimously agreed that the utilization of US aid should be aimed at all Chinese people and not limited to a small number of people in a certain city. Therefore, when distributing grain, the price will be as close as possible to the market price in order to recover a large amount of legal tender.

Editorial

### Starting From the International Nature of the Communist Party

Recently, the Information Bureau of the Communist International in Europe, dissatisfied with the Yugoslav government's adoption of an independent and autonomous foreign policy, condemned Yugoslav leader Marshal Tito for violating Marxism-Leninism, and resolved to expel Marshal Tito from the party, calling on the Yugoslav people to revolt against their government and replace its leader. The occurrence of this event can not only be seen as a crack in the Iron Curtain of Eastern Europe, but also as ironclad proof that the ideology of the Communist International and the concept of the nation-state are fundamentally incompatible. Whether communist parties in various countries around the world embrace international supremacy and have no sense of the nation-state can be seen from their attitude towards this event. It is to be expected that the communist parties of countries such as Poland, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia, under the wings of the master of the Iron Curtain, will echo the master's claims and attack the Yugoslav Communist Party and Marshal Tito; however, the attitude of the Chinese Communist Party toward this event is drawing attention from both domestic and foreign observers. Does the CCP have a concept of the state? Does the CCP have a sense of nationhood? The answers can all be gleaned from the CCP's statement.

After a week's delay, the "Central Committee of the CCP" finally passed a resolution on July 10, issuing a statement "agreeing with the resolution of the Information Bureau of the Communist International in Europe criticizing the Yugoslav Communist Party." Although this resolution has already been broadcast by "Xinhua News Agency," we only saw the full text of the resolution the day before yesterday. In general, it contains the following points: (1) Fully agree with the resolution passed by the conference of the Information Bureau of the Communist International in Europe on the Yugoslav Communist Party issue. The reason is that "holding this conference and passing this resolution is the duty of international communists to defend the principles of Marxism-Leninism and the revolutionary cause of the working class and the people of all countries." (2) Sternly condemn Yugoslav leaders Tito and Kardelj, saying that "in their treacherous and erroneous actions, both internally and externally, they violated the basic tenets of Marx and Lenin." (3) Hope that internationalist elements in the Yugoslav Communist Party can resolutely rise up to correct the mistakes of the Tito clique and bring the Yugoslav Communist Party back on the path of Marxism-Leninism. (4) Believe that the Yugoslav Communist Party incident is "a reflection of the class struggle within the ranks of the proletarian revolution," and the CCP should seriously study this resolution "to strengthen education within the party regarding class, internationalism, self-criticism, and discipline."

In the past, many people, especially some friendly foreigners, inevitably held illusions about the essence of the Chinese Communist Party, thinking that the CCP also had a concept of the state and a sense of nationhood, but that they simply advocated land reform; now, after reading the CCP's statement on the Yugoslav Communist Party issue, they should be able to suddenly realize the truth! The original text of the resolution of the Information Bureau of the Communist International in Europe on the Yugoslav Communist Party issue was quite long, and it was only published in this newspaper on July 12. In a nutshell, this resolution is a frank expression of the Communist International's "Soviet Supremacy" and "International Supremacy". Why is the Soviet Union dissatisfied with the domestic and foreign policies pursued by Yugoslav leader Marshal Tito? The underlying reasons are: firstly, that the Yugoslav Communist Party participates in the People's Front domestically, with the People's Front leading domestic politics, and the Yugoslav Communist Party does not practice one-party dictatorship, with the potential for power to fall into other hands; at the same time, many nationalist elements are hidden within the Yugoslav Communist Party, who regard themselves very highly, exaggerate their own strength, and believe that they can implement socialism independently even without Soviet help. Secondly, in foreign policy, the Yugoslav Communist Party treats the Soviet Union and capitalist countries equally, and even regards the "Soviet Union as an aggressor"; at the same time, it also wants to organize a Balkan Federation with Bulgaria, not hesitating to hinder the Soviet Union's leadership over the countries of the Balkan Peninsula.

From this, it can be seen that the deterioration of Soviet-Yugoslav relations has progressed from the incubation stage to the surface stage. The Soviet Union, for its own interests, is dissatisfied with Marshal Tito's actions, which is inevitable. The Soviet Union went a step further, using the power of the European Communist International to attack the Yugoslav Communist Party and criticize Tito, which was also an inevitable result of the development of the situation. The echoing of the communist parties of Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia shows that so-called "International Supremacy" is also another name for "Soviet Supremacy." Therefore, the CCP's agreement with the resolutions of the eight communist parties on the Yugoslav Communist Party is not the CCP's abandonment of its roots, but rather the exposure of its true colors. From this, we can gain many explanations:

First, the characteristic of the Communist Party does not lie in its adherence to communism, but in its class nature, its struggle nature, and its international nature, especially the final international nature. In the era of Marx and Engels, the international nature of the Communist Party only referred to "workers have no motherland". But after the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, it became "workers have a motherland", but this motherland is not the respective motherland of workers in various countries, but their common motherland "the Soviet Union" only. How do we know this? When the Information Bureau of the Communist International in Europe was established in September last year, it also emphasized national independence and national sovereignty in its declaration, but this time, in its resolution on the Yugoslav Communist Party, it condemned the Yugoslav Communist Party for implementing nationalism and not allowing it to adopt an independent and autonomous foreign policy. Why is the international nature of the Communist Party so contradictory? Obviously, so-called "International Supremacy" is "Soviet Supremacy." Those who are not loyal to the Soviet Union have abandoned internationalism, so their internationalism is another name for taking the Soviet Union as their motherland. This time, the CCP disregarded shame, willingly becoming an echo chamber for the Communist International, expressing its agreement with the resolution of the European Communist International, not particularly interested in the Yugoslav Communist Party incident, but rather expressing its "International Supremacy", wishing to be loyal to its master, the Soviet Union, in everything it does. Recently, the Associated Press reported news of a split in the CCP, saying that the communist party inside the customs might break away from the communist party in the northeast, which is a misperception caused by some Americans not understanding the nature of the CCP.

Second, on May 1 this year, the Communist Party's propaganda machine spread rumors in the Hong Kong area about "convening a new political consultative conference." Some professional politicians were all delighted, spreading the word that the Communist Party would form a "coalition government" with them. But a few days later, the CCP's Xinhua News Agency broadcast a speech by Mao Zedong, emphasizing that his regime must be led by the CCP. A few days later, the CCP area only clamored for "people's congresses," and did not mention a word about the "new political consultative conference." Now, the "Central Committee of the CCP" publicly agrees with the European Communist International's condemnation of the Yugoslav Communist Party, emphasizing class struggle and the leadership of the proletariat over the people's revolutionary cause. The professional politicians who are intoxicated by the dream of a "coalition government" can probably wake up after reading the CCP's statement!

In short, the CCP's belief in the doctrine of "International Supremacy", its willingness to be slaves to the master of the Iron Curtain, and its lack of a concept of the state or a sense of nationhood can be fully seen in this statement. Today, the government is leading the suppression of the rebellion. Suppressing the rebellion is already the current national policy. No citizen should have any doubts about it, and they should no longer harbor any illusions about the CCP, or regard it as an opposition party, or view it as an ordinary political party, or think that when the CCP comes, we can also engage in business and even participate in politics together. The United States is an advanced country in democratic politics and respects any political party, but it does not treat the Communist Party, which has an international nature and secretly acts as a Soviet spy, as an ordinary political party. The indictment of twelve Communist Party leaders in the United States is worthy of our vigilance and reference.

### Minister of Transportation Yu Issues Statement: Price Increases in Transportation and Reduced Flights on Various Routes Mainly Due to High Fuel and Parts Prices

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei recently told reporters regarding the recent price increases in transportation and the reduction of flights by airlines that transportation is originally a service to the public and is not intended for profit. Recently, the outside world has felt that the price increases are too high, but in fact, if compared with the multiple increases in commodity prices, one can understand the difficulties of those who run transportation businesses. The main materials used to maintain transportation at present are fuel and parts. Today, the price of coal is 2.64 million times that of pre-war, aviation gasoline is 3.1 million times, diesel is 4.25 million times, while the railway passenger fare per kilometer is now 216,000 times, freight transport per kilometer is 629,000 times, and postage for ordinary letters is 300,000 times. From this, it can be seen that the actual amount of monthly losses in the transportation business is quite alarming. The recent reduction of flights by airlines also proves that the current prices are still not enough to maintain the minimum cost. The Ministry of Transportation has sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate the details and will do its best to solve their difficulties. Regarding the freight rates of all transportation businesses, the Ministry of Transportation is currently drafting measures to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The main issues are still the prices of fuel and urgently needed parts. It is hoped that the price of fuel can be fixed for a considerable period of time each time, so that the prices of transportation businesses can also be relatively stable for a considerable period of time. Minister Yu continued, stating that the work of the Ministry of Transportation in the past three years has been carried out under the principle of "rushing to repair North China and building South China." It was the same in the past, and it will be the same in the future. Although transportation workers in North China are in a difficult environment, they still have excellent performance. For example, when Chen Yi's bandit troops were driven out of the area north of the Longhai Railway a month ago, the workers of the Longhai Railway repaired the two sections from Xuzhou to Shangqiu and from Kaifeng to Zhengzhou in a few days. In short, as long as transportation personnel have a share of materials, they will do their best to the end.

### Fuel Crisis in the Shipping Industry Ministry of Transportation Attaches Great Importance

Repeatedly Asked the United States to Relax Oil Limits

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] The National Federation of Shipping Associations, recognizing the increasingly serious crisis in the shipping industry, has recently called for attention to the crisis of insufficient supply and skyrocketing prices of fuel oil and coal. According to information from the Ministry of Transportation, the supply of coal and oil is handled by the Fuel Management Committee and the Diesel Allocation Committee of the Import and Export Management Committee. However, the Ministry of Transportation also attaches great importance to the issues of fuel supply and stabilizing oil prices. The transportation of coal has always been given priority, and the new port of Tanggu is being actively built to facilitate the transport of northern coal to the south. The sales price of fuel is determined by the Fuel Management Committee, and the Ministry of Transportation is not in a position to overstep its authority. Regarding the supply and price of fuel oil, the Ministry of Transportation has repeatedly submitted requests to the Executive Yuan to contact the United States through diplomatic channels to relax the quota of oil for our country, so as to enrich the oil supply, and to allow fuel oil for ships to still be settled at the official exchange rate or to allow one-time purchase of three months' worth of oil to stabilize oil prices.

### Xia Tongguang Returns from Overseas Study; Discusses Hollywood Film Industry; Short Films Made by Chinese Nationals Very Popular

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Film artist Xia Tongguang, who was sent to the United States by the China Farmers Education Film Company for overseas study two years ago, has now returned to the country and arrived in Beijing. He stated that in Hollywood, he visited major companies such as 20th Century Fox, Paramount, and Warner, and conducted research work at RKO. The company has 32 studios and a large outdoor location, which is often decorated with streets showcasing the scenery of New York, Chicago, London, Paris, Mexico, China, and India, which can be easily changed and applied at any time. The vast ocean or the sails on a clear lake are all filmed from a large reservoir. American film art work is constantly evolving, and its design and techniques are constantly advancing rapidly. Generally, film companies have art departments, model departments, prop departments, and makeup departments. The American sanitation departments are all headed by architects, and engineers are invited to create samples, various mechanical appliances, etc. The chess model department is used for directors to choose camera angles, and each scene has a concrete and miniature model. The prop department has furnishings and clothing from ancient and modern times, from various countries and regions, like a museum. Even famous paintings and sculptures have replicas. Xia praised the close cooperation between various departments in the American film industry and the high efficiency of work.

### Britain, America and France Plan to Suggest to the Soviet Union Four-Power Talks on General Outstanding Issues But Still Take Lifting the Berlin Blockade as a Precondition General Clay Leaves Washington for Berlin

[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] Official sources revealed: British and American officials in the military western allies next proposed to Moscow to protest the blockade of Berlin's note has been fully politically agreed. These include suggestions by the Soviet Union and the Western allies to discuss the whole German question and other outstanding issues between the two. Officials also explained that the discussion basis for the British, American and French military to initiate a new protest letter was a draft prepared by the United Kingdom, but the point of suggesting discussions with the Soviet Union on Germany and various other issues was a joint plan of the three countries, Britain, America and France. The three powers' insistence that the restoration of normal relations between West Germany and Berlin be a precondition for holding four-power talks is also a common opinion of the three powers. Observers believe that the three powers' suggestion to expand the scope of negotiations, not limited to the German question, can test whether the Soviet Union is truly sincere in peacefully resolving the problems of Berlin, Germany, and even the whole of Europe. This suggestion can make the Berlin problem not be treated as a particularly serious crisis, but to seek solutions together with other disputed outstanding issues, so that Europe can enjoy true peace and stability.

[Our Newspaper News] New York 23rd Broadcast: General Clay attended a meeting of the House Foreign Affairs Committee today. Clay emphasized that the United States is determined to stay in Berlin and has the power to do so. Clay discussed the Berlin situation in detail with the committee members, but the content is unknown. According to one committee member: Peace is still possible, but he also said that the situation is delicate and anything could happen at any time.

[Our Newspaper News] New York 23rd Broadcast: Republican presidential candidate Dewey discussed the Berlin situation with Eisenhower today.

[Reuters, London, 23rd] General Clay, the military governor of the American zone in Germany, may depart for Germany on the evening of the 23rd after holding confidential talks with Truman and Marshall in Washington. Personnel at the American embassy here confirmed the content of the draft of the second note sent by the three powers to the Soviet Union. Britain and America have expressed their agreement, and it can be delivered after the new French cabinet is established and approved. The "New York Times" reported this morning that Soviet Marshal Rukossovsky, who recently arrived in Germany, and Mr. Shanov, who was recently appointed as Sokolovsky's political advisor, have been separately responsible for directing the military and political offensives of the "Berlin Battle." The report also said that Marshal Sokolovsky has agreed to establish a communist dictatorship in the Soviet zone of Germany and Berlin in order to win the favor of the German communists.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] The British Cabinet met on the 22nd to discuss the Berlin crisis. The British defense chiefs were also summoned to attend, including the Chief of the Imperial General Staff Montgomery, the First Sea Lord Cunningham, and the Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defense Hollis. The meeting lasted two hours.

### Sokolovsky Explains the Reason for the Soviet Blockade of Berlin Is Because the American Zone Restricts the Freedom of Soviet Citizens to Travel

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 22nd, United Press] Soviet Commander in Germany Sokolovsky declared that the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin was because the United States did not allow Soviet personnel to enter the American-occupied zone. Sokolovsky also said that if the American-occupied zone allowed Soviet personnel to travel to and from the area, the Soviet Union could lift its blockade of Berlin. For the past three years, we have allowed American personnel to freely travel through international railways and highways from the Soviet-occupied zone to Berlin, but since June of this year, the United States suddenly stated that all Soviet personnel traveling to the American-occupied zone need to have appropriate entry permits, so we have taken the method of blockading Berlin as a countermeasure. According to Soviet military commanders, this is the first time that they have directly expressed opinions on the German question to reporters.

[United Press, Berlin, 23rd] The American military government announced on the 23rd: Soviet military governor Sokolovsky said that the reason why the Soviet Union blockaded Berlin was because the United States restricted travel in the occupied zone. American sources believe that Sokolovsky's words are a strategy to save face, and this move may promote the reopening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. American Deputy Military Governor Hays said: "The United States has always been willing to maintain the highest degree of free movement between the occupied zones. The United States restricted free entry and exit to the American military zone on May 5th of this year because at that time the Soviet Union had restricted American personnel from entering and leaving the Soviet-occupied zone. American personnel could originally enter and leave the Soviet zone in several locations, but the Soviet Union later only opened Hamstedt, so the American side also restricted Soviet personnel to only enter and leave the American zone in that location, and there were no other restrictions."

[United Press, Paris, 23rd] French Foreign Ministry officials said today that they were "very interested" in Soviet military governor Sokolovsky's remarks to the United Press, but refused to make formal criticisms pending further study. However, authoritative sources said that the initial impression was that the Soviet side seemed to intend to dilute the serious problem and place all responsibility on the United States.

### Plan to Establish West Germany May Reach Agreement

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 22nd] The Western occupying powers and the prime ministers of the West German states have reached an agreement on the rapid establishment of West Germany, although this is no longer a problem. The two committees organized by the Germans themselves can begin preparations for the establishment of a constitutional assembly next week. The prime ministers of the eleven West German states met in Ludwigsburg today and re-drafted a counter-proposal to the London Conference. After the completion of the draft, they announced that the West German prime ministers had decided to take full responsibility for reorganizing German affairs based on the powers granted to them by the occupation of Germany. The West German prime ministers will immediately establish two committees to draft a temporary constitution and adjust interstate boundaries, in order to prepare for the unification of the three West German occupation zones and to establish a parliament and administrative organs based on democratic principles in West Germany.

### American Military Police Mistakenly Enter Soviet Zone Detained and Released Immediately

[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] Two American military policemen and one German policeman mistakenly entered the Soviet zone in a car today and were detained. Colonel Villa, the commander of the American military police in Berlin, said that the American military police were at fault and did not intend to protest to the Soviet Union.

[United Press, Berlin, 23rd] The Soviet authorities have released the two arrested American military policemen and one engineer today. According to the report, engineer Gough was detained by the Soviet army on the 20th when he drove a car from the western district of Berlin across the Soviet zone border because he did not have a permit.

### New French Premier Attends Parliament Today Presents List of New Cabinet Members and Announces Platform for Parliamentary Approval

[United Press, Paris, 23rd] French Prime Minister Mali has formed a new cabinet on the 23rd, and once the National Assembly approves his appointment on the 24th, the cabinet lineup can be presented. It is believed that Mali plans to recruit Blum, Reno, LeMardi, and outgoing Prime Minister Schumann into the cabinet. Observers believe that his chances of success are high. Mali telephoned President Oriel today, willing to decide his fate in parliament. Before the phone call, Mali met with first-class figures in the political world all night. If Mali succeeds in forming a cabinet, he would be the first Radical Socialist Party prime minister since Daladier's cabinet fell in 1940. The biggest stumbling block on the way to forming a cabinet was overcome on the morning of the 23rd due to the change of attitude of the People's Republican Party.

[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] Radical Party Mali, who was ordered to form a cabinet, had a long talk with the People's Republican Party this morning, trying to persuade People's Republican Party leader Bidault to give up the post of Foreign Minister and become a minister without portfolio. The People's Republican Party refused to agree, and the negotiations did not yield results. Apart from this point, Mali's cabinet formation negotiations with other parties were generally satisfactory. Mali revealed to reporters this morning that he has received good responses from all parties in parliament, from the Socialist Party to the right-wing Republican Freedom Party. He will report the progress of the negotiations to President Oriel around noon. At the same time, People's Republican Party members issued a statement this morning, saying that whether Mali will receive the party's support depends on his policy address to the National Assembly tomorrow when he introduces his new cabinet. Parliamentarians believe that this statement indicates that the People's Republican Party has agreed in principle to join the cabinet, but the final participation depends on the positions the party obtains. The most important thing is of course that the position of Foreign Minister must still be held by Bidault. It is generally believed that Mali's ability to obtain a vote of confidence from the National Assembly tomorrow is decisively related to the resolution of the Bidault issue.

### Lai Leaves for Geneva

### The Saying that Foreign Spies Use the United Nations Hu Shize Denounces as Slander Marshall Personally Refutes and Feels Gratified

[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 22nd] United Nations Acting Secretary-General Hu Shize said at a press conference today that the United Nations Secretariat staff was very angry at the recent accusation by a US State Department official to a US Congressional subcommittee that the United Nations organization was being used as a smokescreen by foreign espionage agencies.

### South Communist Officials Produced Through Elections

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 23rd Broadcast: Belgrade report; President of the Pan-Slavic Committee, Masarale, told the Yugoslav Communist Party Congress today that the people of Poland and Czechoslovakia harbor doubts about the statement condemning Yugoslavia issued by the Communist Information Bureau. Masarale stated that during his recent travels to Poland and Czechoslovakia, many communist party members and ordinary people told him that the Communist Information Bureau's condemnation of Marshal Tito and Yugoslavia also applied to the communist parties of the two countries.

[Reuters, Belgrade, 23rd Dispatch] Rankovic, the Yugoslav Minister of Internal Affairs who was condemned by the Communist Information Bureau, addressed the South Communist Congress yesterday, admitting that the South Communist Party had made mistakes and oversights during the war, but since liberation, it has effectively utilized the abundant experience gained from the Soviet friendly party in the South. The party's cadres were created according to the Bolshevik system. From 1937 until the occupation of Yugoslavia, the leading personnel within the party were all produced through elections by the party congress. The party headquarters trained party members based on the spirit of Marxism-Leninism. He solemnly denied the Communist Information Bureau's allegations that South Communist officials were appointed rather than elected.

### Strange Aircraft Drops Explosives Over UN Headquarters - Investigation Reveals Act by Veteran

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 22nd Dispatch] There was a slight disturbance at the United Nations Headquarters this afternoon. A bomb suddenly exploded 350 yards from the United Nations office building, but fortunately there were no deaths. According to witnesses, the bomb was a parachute bomb dropped by a low-flying training aircraft as it passed over the building. This is the first such incident since the establishment of the United Nations. Local security authorities believe the incident was purely a prank. The bomb was one used by postal aircraft as a signal when dropping mail.

[Central News Agency, New York, 23rd Dispatch] The person who flew a small plane and dropped a small bomb over the United Nations Headquarters has been identified as a tea server at a hotel. During World War II, he served as a gunner on a B19 bomber. He is currently studying flying under the GI Bill training program. He flew a small plane from Connecticut, 100 miles from Long Island, to drop a bomb over the United Nations building. The bomb exploded in the air. It is said that this person has a peculiar attitude towards the Berlin crisis. He once told people that someone should step forward and bomb the United Nations at this time. There have been two "bombings" of the United Nations. Previously, during the United Nations debate on the Holy Land dispute, an American Jewish pilot flew a single-engine plane over the United Nations and distributed 10,000 leaflets advocating the partition of the Holy Land. These two incidents have led some United Nations staff to believe that the United Nations lacks defenses against attacks by madmen and dreamers, and in this world crisis situation, there are many such madmen.

### Italian Government Overcomes Difficulties - Communist Impeachment Motion Rejected by Senate

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 22nd Dispatch] The Italian Senate today rejected the government impeachment motion proposed by Communist Senator Tracinni by a vote of 173 to 83. Premier Gasperi then spoke to conclude the debate, saying that the events of the past few weeks have proven that the Communist Party is preparing to revolt. The national disturbances, the misuse of weapons, and the widespread strikes all prove that the Communist Party is determined to carry out a conspiracy against the state. The current situation in the country is like that in Czechoslovakia. Gasperi then read out a booklet issued by the Communist Party in several cities, inciting the people to revolt and establishing action committees, saying that the current situation is indeed very serious, and the government must do everything possible to deal with it to prevent a violent coup. The Communist Party is using the "Plan to Defend the Italian Communist Party" as a cover to carry out its rebellion plan, but the government will not tolerate it. In view of the current situation and the psychology of the Communist Party, the government will find it difficult to cooperate with it. He then mentioned the Communist Information Bureau's overbearing order to the Belgrade government, saying that cabinet members who accept foreign orders should not be allowed to remain in the government. He again mentioned the domestic economic situation, saying that 50% of Italian industries are currently subsidized by the state, and the people are greatly affected by strikes, which can only be addressed with socialized reforms. Without socialized reforms, the overall situation cannot be stabilized. Finally, he mentioned the danger of frequent cabinet crises, citing France as an example. Finally, he emphasized that the government is determined to defend the freedom enjoyed by all citizens of the country, and praised the achievements of Interior Minister Selba.

### Cries in the Courtroom - Verdict Announced Yesterday in Dancing Hall Case - Zhu Fei, the Chief Culprit, Sentenced to Four Years in Prison for Violent Coercion - Six Others Acquitted, Sentences Ranging from Three and a Half Years to Two Months

Around 1:00 pm, the gallery of Criminal Division 2 was already crowded with the families of the defendants. After Judge Zhong Xiantai ascended the court, the faces of the defendants and their families suddenly became tense. Feng Aina even burst into tears. Judge Zhong immediately read out the main text of the judgment: "Zhu Fei is sentenced to four years of imprisonment for openly gathering a crowd to use violence and coercion against civil servants while they were performing their duties according to law.

### Foreign Utility Companies Request Relief from Difficulties - Mayor Decides to Ask Central Government to Send Personnel to Shanghai for Consultation

[Report from this newspaper] Representatives of various foreign utility companies in the city, including Hopkins of the Shanghai Power Company, Franglais of the Shanghai Telephone Company, Simpson of the British Gas Company, Latodi of the French Tramway Company, and Pollock, the representative of the Shanghai Tramway Company, visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at 3 pm yesterday to report that after the recent surge in prices, costs have skyrocketed. The companies have so far lost 5 trillion yuan and are unable to maintain their operations. They requested the Municipal Government to find a solution for relief. Mayor Wu and Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau received them in the conference room. Mayor Wu expressed two points from the government's position: on the one hand, the burden on citizens must be considered, and on the other hand, the operations of utility companies must also be considered. He hoped that the companies would submit specific solutions based on the actual losses. The Municipal Government will then telegraph the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of Transportation to send relevant personnel to Shanghai to hold a meeting in the Municipal Government conference room at 2:00 pm on the 27th of this month. The heads of the eight major utility companies and representatives of the Municipal Council will also be invited to attend and discuss the matter together.

### Large Power Company Users to Have Payment Dates Decided

[Report from this newspaper] An official from the Shanghai Power Company told reporters yesterday that he had a slight addition to the report that the company would read meters and charge fees twice a month from next month. He said that the power company has about 100,000 users, and 400 of them (mostly factories, with monthly power consumption of more than 10,000 degrees) account for more than 70% of the total power consumption of all users. At a time when the value of currency is depreciating sharply, the power company itself is experiencing difficulties in the turnover of funds, and it cannot allow these large users to use electricity first and pay later. According to the company, users start using electricity at the beginning of each month, and the meters are read and settled around the 5th of the following month, and all users are notified to pay in the middle of the following month, which is equivalent to users using electricity first and paying on credit for six weeks before paying. In order to facilitate the company's working capital, starting from next month, large users with 400 households will be charged once every half month. The bill for the first half of the month will be based on the past month's electricity consumption, and the price will be estimated and large users will be notified to pay around the 20th of each month. The second half of the month will be read and settled as usual around the 5th, and then large users will be notified to pay the difference in electricity consumption for one month. As for the remaining nearly 100,000 small users, the method of reading meters and paying bills every month will remain temporarily unchanged.

### Conflicting Rumors About the Selection of Director of Economic Management Bureau

[Report from relevant sources] Although the establishment of the Economic Control Bureau has been decided, its scope of functions and the selection of responsible persons are still under consideration by the authorities. It is not true that a decision has already been made. It is said that the central government initially intended Mayor Wu to take the position of director, but the mayor firmly declined. As a result, someone suggested that Chiang Ching-kuo be responsible, but this was also not agreed upon. Most people believe that it would be most reasonable for Yu Hongjun to concurrently hold this position in terms of common sense. However, up to now, although there have been various rumors about this, they are all speculative and cannot be deeply believed. In the future, after the bureau is formally established, its nature will only be a design and decision-making institution, and its scale will not be very large. The promotion of business will also be the responsibility of the current competent authorities. Only because of the existence of the bureau can the effect of coordination and cooperation be achieved. As for how many agencies the Economic Management Bureau can command, it will be decided only after the Executive Yuan meeting is held for discussion.

### Operating Hours of Congee Shops Approved for One-Hour Extension

Request from Shaoxing Wine Industry Denied

### 13th Phase Household Sugar to be Distributed Next Month on the 6th - Prices About Three Times Higher

[Report from this newspaper] The Sugar Group of the Price Evaluation Committee held a meeting yesterday and decided that the 13th phase household sugar certificates will be issued to various districts on the 29th and 30th of this month, and distributed from the 6th to the 15th of next month. The distribution price per catty will be about 200,000 yuan, which is about three times higher than the previous phase of 50,000 yuan per catty. However, this negotiated price still needs to be approved by Director Wu.

### Modification of Price Quotation and Sales Method

Since the implementation of the Taiwan Sugar price quotation and sales method decided at the previous meeting, the South Goods Industry Association and several businesses have requested modification. Yesterday, it was decided to add four modification methods: (1) The original minimum of 50 bags was changed to 10 bags, (2) The original maximum amount of no more than 1,000 bags was increased to "may be reduced depending on the actual situation," (3) Taiwan Sugar's quoted price shall not exceed the market price, (4) The original quotation time in the morning was changed to the afternoon.

Some Taiwan Sugar merchants who were previously reselling Taiwan Sugar were permanently suspended from distribution due to adulteration, watering, and shortage of weight. The South Goods Industry Association requested the association to reconsider its decision because its punishment was too severe, but it was not discussed yesterday.

### August Rice Ration Prices Expected to Reach 40 Million Per Stone - Ration Prices for the Poor to be Decided After Meeting

[Report from this newspaper] The US side insists that the August household rice price must be calculated at 95% of the average price of the last five days of this month. If calculated according to this method, the household rice will reach 40 million yuan per stone, which is almost the same as the market price. The People's Livelihood Committee is currently negotiating with the US side, hoping to reduce the burden on citizens. However, due to the restrictions of the Sino-US agreement, it is feared that there will be no effect. Currently, the People's Livelihood Committee is organizing a special rice distribution at preferential prices for the poor starting in August, in an attempt to remedy this defect. According to Section Chief Zhang of the Press Office of the committee, there are 5 million citizens in this city, and the truly poor account for about one-fifth. Only if these 1 million people have food to eat can social order be stabilized. It is rumored that after the implementation of rice distribution for the poor, the ordinary household rice will be cancelled, which is absolutely incorrect.

In addition, the People's Livelihood Committee's investigation of the work of the poor in various districts is limited to completion tomorrow. The list of the poor will be announced at the office of the head of each neighborhood. Those who are not poor and mingle among them may be reported by the public and removed. Those who are indeed poor and have been omitted may apply for supplementary reporting. This list of the poor will be finalized at the end of this month and purchase permits will be issued to the poor immediately, attached with the household rice purchase certificate, which will be discounted according to the household rice price. The calculation method is yet to be decided at the meeting.

### Japanese Ship Loads Goods and Sails to Qinhuangdao - China Merchants Bureau Requests Submission for Negotiation

The Japanese ship Samarin Maru, under the order of the Allied Headquarters, loaded kiln wood and sleepers and arrived in Qinhuangdao from Kobe on the 19th. According to the investigation, the ship's arrival in China is a barter trade between the China Trust Bureau and Japan, which has nothing to do with infringing on our shipping rights. However, according to the person in charge of the China Merchants Bureau, the Bureau's Zizhong ship has been to Japan three times, intending to load kiln wood and sleepers in Japan and other places, but all three times it returned empty-handed, losing the goods. Therefore, the arrival of the Japanese ship Samarin Maru in Qinhuangdao is quite incomprehensible. A telegram has been sent to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Transportation, and other relevant departments, requesting that negotiations be initiated.

### Special Court Investigation of Major Foreign Exchange Fraud Case Involving Three Companies Nearing Completion

[Report from this newspaper] The case of the Shanghai Linwang, Sanwei, and Dahua companies privately converting huge amounts of foreign exchange has attracted much attention from all parties. After the police department transferred the case to the Special Criminal Court for investigation, it has been two months. It is learned that the case will soon be concluded and a decision will be made whether to prosecute. Wang Zhennan, the President of the Special Criminal Court, said that the case does not comply with the Regulations on Punishing Emergency Crimes Endangering the State during the Period of Suppression of Rebellion. After applying to the Ministry of Justice for approval, the investigation will be conducted using the Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Control Regulations and the Regulations on Punishing the Purchase and Sale of Gold and Foreign Currency.

### Ban on Iron-Wheeled Trucks - Provisional Measures Passed Yesterday in Municipal Affairs Conference

[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Government previously limited the conversion of iron-wheeled trucks to pneumatic tires to be completed before July 1, 1948. Later, the City Tiger Truck Professional Union submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau, asking for gradual implementation after prices stabilize. Recently, the Public Utilities Bureau convened representatives from the Police Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, the Tiger Truck Professional Union, and the Collapse Tiger Truck Commercial Guild to discuss and agree on two principles: (1) Iron-wheeled trucks, such as those who voluntarily convert to pneumatic-tired vehicles, should still be converted as much as possible; however, after the conversion, attention should be paid to the size of the vehicle itself (after a 500-pound iron-wheeled vehicle is converted to a pneumatic-tired vehicle, the load shall not exceed 1,000 pounds, and after an iron-wheeled vehicle of 1,000 pounds or more is converted to a pneumatic-tired vehicle, the load shall not exceed 2,240 pounds). (2) If the owner is unable to convert the iron-wheeled truck to a pneumatic-tired vehicle, it is proposed to levy an additional fee for road repairs. Provisional measures for banning iron-wheeled tiger trucks in urban areas after July 1, 1948 were drafted and submitted for approval at yesterday's 135th Municipal Affairs Conference. The measures state that all large and small iron-wheeled tiger trucks that cannot be converted to pneumatic tires within the limited time of July 1, if they are still driving in the city after July 1, 1948, in addition to paying the vehicle license tax to the Finance Bureau in violation of the regulations, they must also pay a fine for the delayed conversion of iron-wheeled tiger trucks to pneumatic tires before they can obtain a license to drive, in order to show the ban. The fine for the delayed conversion of pneumatic tires is temporarily set at 2 million yuan per vehicle per year.

### Wind, Rain, and Hail Damage - This Year's Pinghu Melon Production Reduced - Second Vine Melon Prices Expected to Exceed 10 Million

[Report from this newspaper] The heat is approaching, and watermelons are already on the market. Although prices are quite alarming due to the high cost of everything, compared with other cold drinks, it is still a popular summer refreshment. The watermelons in this city rely on the supply from Chongming, Pudong, Suzhou, and Pinghu, but among them, the pillow melon from Pinghu is delicious and popular, and the production area is also large, so it is listed as a major item. In the past, when melons were ripe, the sales of Pinghu melons in this city reached as many as 2 to 3 million pieces. According to people in the industry, this year's Pinghu watermelons could have been expected to have a bumper harvest, but due to the previous typhoon and hail damage, coupled with more than ten consecutive days of rain, the melon vines were damaged and the output was greatly affected. Therefore, it is estimated that only about 500,000 dans can be transported to this city for sale this year. The first vine melons that appeared in the middle of this month have been transported to 50,000 to 60,000 dans. Due to insufficient sweetness and the influence of the climate, they were only sold for 4 to 5 million yuan per dan at the cheapest time. Yesterday, due to the heat, the price rose to about 8 million yuan per dan. If the weather continues to be sunny for several days, the second vine melons that will be on the market will not only increase in sweetness, but if the actual sales are strong, the price will undoubtedly exceed 10 million. Most of the watermelon shops in this city are concentrated in the Dongmen Road and Limalu areas of the Shiliupu, among which the largest are Yongde, Tang Hengtai, Xiangmao, Pan Yuansheng, and Shunchang, and there are about 30 other smaller shops. Each shop has its own ships to transport melons from Pinghu to Shanghai. The freight is calculated in rice, requiring 15 stones per ship per month. One ship can load more than 3,000 melons. However, due to the reduced melon volume and high interest rates, it is said that the profits of the melon shops are not as good as before.

In the past, some melon merchants purchased a large number of melons during the melon season and stored them in cold storage warehouses, so that they could be sold at good prices during Christmas and winter. This kind of transaction, which is not noticed by ordinary people, is extremely profitable. This year, the watermelon production has suddenly decreased, which is a good opportunity for this industry to purchase and store, but due to the high rent of the warehouses and the ability of Taiwanese watermelons to be sold in Shanghai in winter, it is said that no one has made this plan as of now.

### Social Affairs Bureau Seals Suspicious Warehouse Materials - Organizing Review Committee to Discuss Handling Methods

[Report from this newspaper] In order to suppress and stabilize prices, starting from the 16th of this month, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Garrison Department, the Military Police Corps, and the Police Bureau jointly inspected 34 warehouses that had not reported exceeding the time limit in five groups, and the investigation of the war has been completed recently. The reporter visited Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday and inquired about the results of the inspection. He was told: "The most in these warehouses are gauze, paper, coal, and diesel. Because the quantity is very large, statistics are still being compiled. There are also items stored in 1947, among which there are the following three suspected items: (1) hoarding goods exceeding three months' needs, (2) non-industry personnel engaged in hoarding, (3) stack orders are unregistered and only have the words "Pay upon presentation of the order". All of these have been sealed, and the warehouse managers have been ordered to guarantee that they will not be moved. Today (the 23rd), the Municipal Affairs Conference decided that the Social Affairs Bureau would invite the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Police Bureau, the Monetary Administration Bureau, and the Municipal Government Counselor's Office to form a review committee to hold a meeting next week to discuss the handling methods. It is proposed to hand over the verified hoarded goods to the market for sale at par prices, and the proceeds will be returned to the original owner after deducting the fines, but the goods hoarded by non-industry personnel will be confiscated. If there is legal liability involved, it will be transferred to the judicial organs for handling. These handling methods will be submitted to the Municipal Government for approval after consultation before implementation. Other warehouses that have been reported will also be continuously inspected to assess whether they are false or not."

### Three Council Committees Hold Separate Meetings

The Finance Committee of the Municipal Council held its 26th meeting yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., with a heated discussion on the draft of the city bank organization regulations. It was finally decided that, before the central government promulgates the organizational law for municipal banks, the city bank will temporarily maintain its current status. The committee will also nominate seven councilors to be responsible for researching organizational regulations suitable for the city bank's needs and submit them to the central government for reference. The proposal to exempt suburban stores from business license tax was also approved. In addition, the Committee on Autonomous Law Research and the Committee on Separate Regulations also held separate meetings yesterday afternoon.

### General Household Re-Registration Postponed to Next Month

[Reported by this newspaper] The general household re-registration, originally scheduled for the 20th of this month by the Public Security and Police Bureaus, has been postponed to August due to insufficient staffing. At the same time, national identity cards will also be inspected, with the entire process lasting ten days. The Police Bureau announced the inspection dates, methods, and work procedures as follows yesterday: (1) A general census of hotels and inns will be conducted on the afternoon of August 1st. Special teams will also be dispatched to inspect vagrants and beggars with no fixed abode, refugees sleeping on the streets, and boats, etc. Starting at 8 a.m. on August 2nd, inspections of all types of households on land will be carried out (including all stores, residences, factories, institutions, schools, etc.). (2) All inspection personnel will be divided into several teams, with the bao [neighborhood unit] as the unit. Each team will consist of one police officer, two bao cadres, one household registration cadre, and one auxiliary police officer. Special teams will be established in important areas to focus on inspecting the population with no fixed abode. All stationed guards in various locations must assist. Furthermore, before the general household re-registration begins, the Public Security and Police Bureaus will screen lantern slide advertisements in local cinemas to educate citizens on basic household registration knowledge.

### Large Denomination Notes Appear, Prices Soar, The Lives of Ordinary People Become Increasingly Difficult

[Special report from this newspaper] Since the introduction of the five million yuan denomination note, no matter how the National Bank tightens credit, no matter how the wholesale price increases slow down, general retail prices remain stubbornly high. Just look, in the past three or four days, the prices of everything one eats and wears have increased by 50% to 100%. The ones who suffer the most are the ordinary people. Going to the market early in the morning to buy vegetables, the price of pork has reached one million yuan per catty. Beef is not far behind, at 900,000 yuan per catty. Refrigerated yellow croaker costs 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per tael, chicken eggs cost 70,000 to 80,000 yuan each, and duck eggs range from 60,000 to 90,000 yuan each. As a second choice, let's eat vegetarian. But vegetarian dishes are no longer what they used to be. A small piece of tofu costs 100,000 yuan, yellow bean sprouts cost 140,000 yuan per catty, green vegetables, potatoes, and mung bean sprouts cost 100,000 yuan per catty. With cooking oil costing nearly one million yuan per catty, the price difference between vegetarian and meat dishes is only a short distance.

Buying Coal Balls Guaranteed to Receive Scorn

Saving where possible and forcing oneself to eat vegetarian, one might gain a reputation for dieting in the summer. But things don't go as planned. With less oil in one's stomach, the consumption of rice increases by double. The household rice ration is not enough, so one has to turn to the black market for rice, costing 44 million yuan per dan [a unit of dry measure]. Market reports clearly state that the retail price of coal balls is 3.6 million yuan per dan. However, when you offer this price to a coal ball store, you are guaranteed to receive a scornful look from the owner. Ask at the second store, and the clerks will tell you that coal balls at 3.6 million yuan are sold out. Now they only have coal balls at 5.5 million yuan per dan. The most heartless thing is soap, which only rises in price and never goes back down, costing 700,000 yuan per bar. To make matters worse, it's the hot season. After bathing, one still has to do laundry, and a bar doesn't last long. Even more frightening is the increase in water prices, which has jumped two to three times. The average household water bill for this month is around 6 million yuan. This is difficult for ordinary couples who rely on firewood, rice, oil, and salt, and even more so for those on salaries who only get paid at the end of the month. What's worse is that July's income is still calculated based on the June cost of living index. After all the twists and turns, those on salaries can only sit and wait for their "demise."

Medical Expenses Exceed Ten Million After Three Visits

In a famine year, one can't be too picky about food. But when a smoking addiction flares up, it's truly unbearable. Looking at the various cigarettes in the cigarette shop, the prices are new every day. Imported "Camel," "Lucky Strike," and "Marlboro" cigarettes are all around one million yuan. Even "British American Tobacco," "Old Gold," and "Craven A" are hovering around 300,000 yuan. One or two packs a day will further increase the deficit in the household's monthly budget. The weather is suddenly cold and suddenly hot, with unpredictable sunshine and rain. Colds and stomachaches are common minor ailments, but if you can't endure them and consult a hospital, the registration fee alone costs one million yuan. A few small packets of medicine powder will cost you 2 or 3 million yuan. If you calculate three visits to the doctor, the total expenditure will exceed the ten million yuan mark. A shoe store on Nanjing Road advertised a 20% discount for summer shoes ten days ago. At the beginning, a pair of ordinary black leather shoes was priced at 13.6 million yuan after the 20% discount. How long ago was it? Now the price tag reads 25.6 million yuan, while the 20% discount sign is still prominently displayed.

Ice Cream Powder Snatched Up

In a department store on the same road, cotton athletic socks were priced at 600,000 yuan per pair last weekend. After the large denomination notes were introduced, the price increased to 1.1 million yuan. Short white wool athletic socks, originally priced at 3 million yuan per pair and only available in small sizes, increased to 6 million yuan after the large denomination notes were introduced, and all sizes became available. The price of ice cream powder from the Materials Supply Bureau has gradually increased from 750,000 yuan to 3.84 million yuan per can. Two weeks ago, each distributor still had 100 cans available for retail sale each day, but they were snatched up in less than fifteen minutes after opening in the morning. This batch of ice cream powder was sold out by distributors a week ago. It is said that the Materials Supply Bureau has a considerable amount of stock, but they have stopped distributing it when it is most needed in the market, causing the price of ice cream powder to rise to 14 million yuan per can in the past two days. Isn't this creating opportunities for scalpers?

The Wealthy Enjoy Themselves

Large companies have "Arrow" brand shirts for 70 million yuan each, boxes of 25 expensive cigars for 90 million yuan each, bottles of "Remy Martin" brandy for 55 million yuan each, bottles of whiskey for 85 million yuan each, Western suits for 1 billion yuan each, "Parker" gold pens (14K) for 640 million yuan per set, refrigerators, electric stoves, and washing machines for 4 billion to 5 billion yuan each... In the eyes of dignitaries and officials, as long as there is a market and they have spare money, they can afford to buy these things. Shanghai is a world for the wealthy. No matter how refugees cry out, how public servants complain, or how those on salaries lament their suffering, the wealthy still indulge in pleasure, and the poor deserve their fate.

Rice Consumption Doubles, Store Prices Change Daily

### Tongyi Primary and Secondary School Teachers Generously Donate Scholarships

Yesterday, this newspaper received the news that all faculty and staff of Tongyi Primary and Secondary School are transferring their education bureau subsidy of 7,228,800 yuan to be used as scholarships, which greatly moved us.

### Coca-Cola Production Process, Watson's Hosts Visit

[Reported by this newspaper] Watson's Soda Company hosted the local press yesterday to visit the Coca-Cola production process, which can be divided into five parts: sterilizing the water, mixing ingredients, washing bottles, filling, and capping. The company's Infilco water sterilization machine is the latest and most effective machine. After clean water enters the water tank, it is first sterilized with nitrogen, then filtered through sand filters, paper filters, and activated carbon. The walls and floor of the mixing room are covered with ceramic tiles, making it exceptionally clean. Syrup is stored in sealed stainless steel barrels, and the mixer inside the barrel does not come into contact with the air. The room is equipped with a sterilizing ultraviolet lamp to kill bacteria in the air. The bottle washing process is the most complex. The bottle washing machine is 53 feet long. Old bottles are sent into the machine and automatically rotate forward, taking nine minutes to complete, going through 65 different types of rinsing. Finally, skilled workers carefully inspect them under strong light, eliminating empty bottles that have not been completely cleaned. After inspection, the empty bottles are sent by an automatic conveyor chain to the syrup filling machine. After filling to a certain amount, they are automatically moved to the capping machine for capping. At this point, the entire manufacturing process is complete. From washing the empty bottles, mixing ingredients, filling, and capping, the entire process is handled by machines. Workers only manage the machines and never touch the bottle openings directly with their fingers.

### The Mogan Mountain Under Construction: A "Peach Blossom Spring," But Not "Beyond the World" - The Old Three-Year Plan Is No Longer Adequate

— Our Reporter Huang Xing-tian

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 22nd Dispatch] In the sweltering summer, the name of Mogan Mountain is once again on people's minds, because it represents a secluded and cool summer resort, as famous as Qingdao and Guling, both at home and abroad. Mogan Mountain is located in Wukang County, Zhejiang Province, a branch of the Tianmu Mountains, with an average altitude of 1,800 to 2,000 feet. The highest peak is Tashan, which is 2,500 feet above sea level. To the east, one can see the Qiantang River, and to the north, one can see Tai Lake. Historically, the name of Mogan Mountain is said to have come from the story of King Helü of Wu ordering Gan Jiang and Mo Ye to cast swords on the mountain. Later generations named it in their memory. Mogan Mountain became a summer resort after the seventh year of Emperor Guangxu's reign in the Qing Dynasty. Initially, several European and American hunters discovered that this place had beautiful scenery and a cool climate, making it an ideal summer resort. Therefore, they flocked to purchase land on the mountain from the monks of Tianchi Temple to build villas. Later, wealthy people from Shanghai also followed suit and built houses on the mountain. By the 17th year of the Republic of China, when Zhang Jingjiang governed Zhejiang, there was already a considerable number of residents on the mountain, and a Mogan Mountain Management Bureau was specially established as an administrative body. Since then, it has prospered year by year. Although it suffered some damage during the war, it was less than one-tenth of its original state, and the scale remained the same. Currently, there are more than 200 houses on the mountain, with a summer transient population of over 10,000 (not including those who come to play temporarily), and the permanent population in the area has reached 40,000. Climbing up the steps, lush bamboo grows on both sides, and white clouds float in the mountainside, making one suspect that the mountain is above the clouds, and the ornate buildings are like mirages. Such a "Peach Blossom Spring"-like realm inevitably attracts the attention of Chinese and Western people from Shanghai, who compete to escape the summer heat.

Does escaping the summer heat require US dollars?

In fact, not many people went to Mogan Mountain to escape the summer heat this year. The main reason is that although Mogan Mountain is a "Peach Blossom Spring," it is not "beyond the world." It cannot avoid the impact of rising prices. Many people say that escaping the summer heat on Mogan Mountain requires calculations in US dollars, and staying for one or two nights can cost as much as 100 million national currency, which scares many people away. Although Mogan Mountain does have foreign houses that are rented in US dollars (usually 600 US dollars per season), and there are places where wealthy guests can spend hundreds of millions of dollars a day, this is from a luxurious perspective. Mogan Mountain has the Mogan Hotel, which costs 10 to 20 million per night, and also small hotels and apartments that cost 1 to 2 million per day, and even temporary rooms in ordinary hotels that cost 400,000 to 500,000 to spend the night. Accommodation is like this, and so is eating. In short, the prices on Mogan Mountain are generally similar to those in Hangzhou. If you make the most economical plan, you can spend three days of cool and quiet life on the mountain for 20 million yuan. Currently, there are more than 20 large and small hotels on the mountain, which can accommodate 1,000 to 2,000 people per day. There are three restaurants, but the main business is still in the dining departments of the hotels.

Planned New Projects

During the Anti-Japanese War, the public and private buildings and the collapsed water sources and roads on Mogan Mountain could not be quickly repaired due to financial difficulties. In order to restore the old appearance and seek development, the Mogan Mountain Management has been implementing a three-year reconstruction plan for Mogan Mountain since this year. The construction projects to be carried out in this plan include: (1) Roads: The old road from Yucun to Mogan Mountain (12,517 feet long) will be completely rebuilt with cement paving, and the surface of the new road up the mountain (19,580 feet long) will be repaired, and the road system of the entire mountain will be determined according to the natural environment. (2) Electricity: A power plant will be set up under Tashan, and two 75-horsepower diesel generators will be installed, and underground power lines will be connected to various users. (3) Water Supply: The original water sources will be repaired, and a large-scale reservoir will be planned at the southern end of Zhonghua Mountain to solve the water supply problem for residents of Gangtou Road. (4) Sewerage: The sewerage system will be gradually completed along with the new road system. (5) Public Buildings: Public buildings in the mountain, such as auditoriums, libraries, swimming pools, and ballrooms, have already taken shape, and it is planned to repair the road pavilions. (6) Scenic Spots and Historical Sites: The main scenic spots and historical sites, such as Jianchi (Sword Pond), Luhuadang (Reed Flower Marsh), Tashan Park, Guaishigu (Strange Stone Valley), Biwu (Emerald House), Shijing (Stone Surprise), and Zhiji Pavilion, will be repaired first. In addition, security police will be strengthened, trees and flowers will be planted, and attention will be paid to cleanliness and hygiene. The entire plan is scheduled to be completed in the 39th year of the Republic of China (1950), and its funding will come entirely from the Reconstruction Donation. The Reconstruction Donation has been levied since July 1st this year. It is estimated that 7 billion can be collected this year. The collection targets are divided into two parts: one is the owners, who will be charged 5% of the house price, divided into six grades, with the highest rate being 25 per thousand of the house price, and it is estimated that 4 billion can be collected. The other is tourists, who will be charged 20% of the room rate, and it is estimated that 3 billion can be collected. However, according to the previous collection situation, it is estimated that only half of it will be collected, about 3 billion or more. However, the construction project is still actively underway, and 60% of this year's plan has been completed.

Civilian Construction Plan

When the reporter went to Mogan Mountain, it coincided with the Zhejiang Provincial Government's decision to expand the administrative area of the Mogan Mountain Management Bureau, ordering the relevant counties of Wukang, Wuxing, and Anji to quickly handle the handover. According to this new area, starting from Sanqiaobu in Wukang in the east, Xiaoguanqiao in Wukang in the south, Wuanqiao in Wukang in the west, and Biwu in Wuxing in the north, within a radius of more than 120 kilometers, there are sixteen scenic areas, including Gaofeng Mountain, Shuangji Mountain, Yangmei Mountain, Zhai Mountain, Shanqiaobu, Shiyi Mountain, Tongguan Mountain, Liantongtan, Moling, Bijia Mountain, Yizi Mountain, Xianrenwan, Liuhe Mountain, Biwu, Tianquan Mountain, and Hemuqiao. Among them, Tianquan Mountain, originally belonging to Wuxing, covers an area of 400 mu, with towering trees and clear springs, making it an ideal place to escape the summer heat, even more pleasant than Mogan Mountain itself. Therefore, the newly appointed Director of the Mogan Mountain Management Bureau, Wang Zhengyi, deeply felt that the old three-year plan was inadequate. Therefore, he will design another comprehensive construction plan to prosper this summer resort that is missed by thousands of people. But even more precious is his other ambition: he will make Mogan Mountain civilianized, taking this summer resort from the hands of the big capitalists and serving the middle class and the common people of the city. He is not satisfied with tall buildings and big mansions, but quite admires the simple and beautiful small foreign houses built by the Japanese in the summer resort of Taiwan. Therefore, he quite wants to follow the example of the Germans in managing Qingdao, buying all the land on the mountain at a low price, and then systematically dividing it into countless small pieces, each with an area of one or two mu, and selling them to the people at a fair price. This will not only solve the problem of construction funding, but also make the prosperity of Mogan Mountain easier to achieve. Currently, a small number of people own a large amount of land, arbitrarily raising land prices, making the price of Mogan Mountain land equal to the land price in the most bustling areas of Hangzhou City, making many people who want to build houses on the mountain also speechless and hesitant. Such an unreasonable phenomenon will not reappear under the plan of public ownership of land.

This is a lovely vision. In the future, we will see that those who come to Mogan Mountain to escape the summer heat will not only be the Russians, Jews, Americans, and large Shanghai merchants who are rich in US dollars, but more will be people from the common class. Even small civil servants and intellectuals can easily go to the mountain to escape the summer heat. Although this seems like a luxurious dream today, it is not an impossible plan after all. We hope that Director Wang will continue to move forward!

### [麻茹团] Cracked Down in Beiping - Forcing Rape at Knifepoint and Embezzling Public Funds

Five Arrested, Others Under Surveillance

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd Dispatch] A strange incident occurred in Beiping: Lu Jiefu, who claimed to be the Chairman of the Northeast Provisional High School Student Autonomous Association, and members of the "[麻茹团]" (Ma Ru Tuan) group under his leadership, were arrested for forcing female classmates to rape at knifepoint and embezzling public funds. According to Sun Pengyue, the captain of the investigation team of the Dongda Student Autonomous Association, who assisted in resolving this incident, Lu was among the first batch of people who came to Beiping. He appointed himself as the Chairman of the Provisional High School Student Autonomous Association, embezzled public funds, and acted recklessly. He also purchased eleven electric knives from the remaining materials of the US military and distributed them to the group members who were coerced and lured into joining. Lu was equipped with a badge from a certain pacification agency and claimed to be related to a certain agency. He told his group members that after training, they could be sent to work in Harbin, Chahar, and other places. If they refused to join, he threatened them with electric knives and guns. Lu also privately carved the seal of the Tieling Middle School of Liaoning Province and the principal's seal, manufactured and sold certificates, and carried a temporary leave certificate with the number 9379 from a certain agency's major staff officer. Here, Lu once forced female classmate Fu Wenliang to rape and published a notice in the newspaper declaring their engagement. He also attempted to force sixteen-year-old female classmates Pan Chunjun and Zhu Guo to rape, causing Pan to develop severe heart disease. The students were extremely angry and signed a petition for help on the 20th, which was submitted to the Dongda Student Autonomous Association. Only on the 22nd, they, together with the police, arrested Lu and five others. In addition, several others have been placed under surveillance by Dongda students. It is said that this case is very complicated, with non-student elements involved. The students are rectifying the internal affairs and will make a statement to avoid affecting their reputation.

### Changzhou's Grain Official Lawsuit - Morning Glories Bloom Everywhere!

— Our Reporter Li Tianxing

Wu Zhihui Seeks Justice for a Good Person - Lu Pinjin's Confused Account

[Our Newspaper, Wujin, 21st Dispatch] The Changzhou Grain Office's corruption case, involving the sale of grain, transportation for external processing, and collusion with grain merchants, a series of cases, has developed to the point where more and more problems are emerging, just like morning glories, blooming one after another, which is really impressive. Lu Pinjin is one of the main characters. After fleeing to Hangzhou, he sent a confused account from Weng Ren's account at the inn to the Grain Office by post. All payment bills only had a seal "翁　," and the deputy director, section chief, and accountant were all blank, which also means that they are not responsible, and all responsibility is borne by Weng Cheng.

Wu Zhilao believes that the Grain Office's corruption case has implicated a good person, Wu Shuchun, from the Caoqiao Office in a lawsuit, while the主管长官 (zhuguan zhangguan) (responsible official) is still at large, expressing unlimited emotion. He wrote a letter to Senator Xue Digong, hoping that the Senate would seek justice for him impartially.

Jin Zhenyi, the manager of the Hengji Rice Mill, runs his factory in the same way as Tianfeng. He was originally a shareholder of Tianfeng and also Tianfeng's guarantor. He embezzled more than 1,400 dan of grain. Jin is now a senator and has recently started a Minsheng Daily. The county government is handling his matter very seriously, and finally had to summon him to pursue the recovery of the grain. He was soon released on bail to handle the matter. Unexpectedly, after Jin was released on bail, he fled without a trace. Several guarantors were fooled. Each guarantor is responsible for compensating 400 dan of grain. The county government once summoned the guarantors. The guarantors explained the process of acting as guarantors, which was just like a scam. Now that they have been hooked, they have nowhere to complain, and they have to find another guarantor. Guarantor guarantees guarantor, this was originally Jin Zhenyi's good play. Jin Zhenyi sent a letter to his friend from Shanghai, saying: The case is not over, I do not intend to return for the time being!

### Agriculture Zhejiang's Call Enters the Concretization Stage - 25 Counties Set Up Demonstration Zones

— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 22nd Dispatch] Recently, there is good news in Zhejiang, that is, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has taken a fancy to Zhejiang Province. They, together with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Provincial Government, are preparing to build Zhejiang into an ideal agricultural demonstration province.

Zhejiang Province, this famous and prosperous region, if evaluated by the current standards, it is gradually declining, because now is the era of science, and the most important thing is of course industry, and agriculture must also use mechanization for production, so that it can reach the modern economic level. Unfortunately, our Zhejiang has no industrial foundation by nature - not many mineral deposits, and even fewer coal deposits. Agricultural production is still entirely dependent on the hard work of farmers plowing the land bit by bit and harvesting grain by grain. The production method in Zhejiang Province is actually the old set from hundreds of years ago. Its name of "prosperity" is only inherited from the reputation left by its ancestors. As for rural side businesses, the famous silk and tea have also been ridiculed by foreign markets due to the lack of improvement in production methods, becoming a declining door.

Standing on the land of Zhejiang, we look forward to the future of Zhejiang. In fact, only the revitalization of agriculture is possible. The vast plains of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, the Qiantang River, the Fuchun River, the Puyang River, and the Cao'e River can irrigate the rich lands far and near. The natural landscape has already made it an agricultural region, not to mention the mulberry trees and tea forests everywhere, which is really a great land of fish and rice!

In 1946, the Sino-US joint agricultural technology investigation team traveled all over the country. In the plan they formulated, one of the most important points was to set up an agricultural demonstration zone. The location of the demonstration zone was actually selected in Zhejiang. Two years of negotiations have made this demonstration zone concrete. Therefore, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, together with the key负责人 (fuzeren) (person in charge) of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, came to Hangzhou to formulate a more concrete plan. According to a负责人 (fuzeren) (person in charge) in the Agricultural Organization, they brought this time to see whether the local government is determined to do this business. After several talks, they felt satisfied, so they agreed to jointly form the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Promotion Committee, and decided to set up seven委负 (wei fu) (committee members), and first use 25 counties as demonstration zones, with the United Nations allocating 86 billion, the Zhejiang Provincial Government 30 billion, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 15 billion. I went to ask Gong Peicheng, the Director of the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province, and learned that the address of the demonstration zone has been selected in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Jinhua areas. The 86 billion from the United Nations can be remitted immediately. After the remittance, it is strongly requested to purchase physical objects, which has also been agreed to by Chen Baolin, the Director of the Finance Department. The 30 billion from Zhejiang Province was also approved at the Provincial Government meeting on July 22.

The scope of their business, the first step is to increase production, according to the performance of various lands, plant various grains suitable for the performance of the land, and other departments will slowly start to do it. Talking about increasing production, there are many related problems, such as the construction of water conservancy, the distribution of increased value of agricultural land harvest, the lending of farmers' seed capital, etc. According to Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Jinhua and other regions, the north of Hangzhou, Jiaxing and Huzhou has Taihu Lake, and there are many ports in the territory, which is a natural water town. Ningbo and Shaoxing regions have the Cao'e River running through them, especially Ningbo has Dongqian Lake for irrigation, and the Jinhua region is surrounded by Puyang River and Jinhua River, which is of course easier to achieve water conservancy. However, the Cao'e River, Puyang River, and Jinhua River have only been slightly dredged in recent years, and no major projects have been done. In Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou areas, water is drawn using the old methods of human and cattle power, which cannot save labor and be used for other purposes. Therefore, if we want to increase production, we must carefully investigate irrigation and water conservancy, and the ones that should be dredged should be dredged immediately, and the ones that should be changed to water pumps should be changed to water pumps urgently, so that we can harvest the practical effects of the natural geographical advantages.

Regarding the lending of farmers' seeds and capital, we have become accustomed to the government lending agricultural loans every year, and some agricultural loans are issued during the autumn harvest, and some agricultural loans have not reached the hands of farmers at all, and have been intercepted by general disguised fake farmer organizations for other transactions. In today's rural areas, there are still many new local tyrants. These new local tyrants ask the government representatives to demand high prices for farmers, and implement oppression on farmers. The reporter has entered the rural areas of Jiaxing and they told me that there are still people who borrow high-interest loans for farming, and they have to repay these high-interest loans with physical objects, borrowing one and repaying three, equivalent to borrowing an egg and repaying a chicken's harsh exploitation. Therefore, if we want to lend seeds and capital to farmers, we should go deep into the countryside, visit households one by one, and actually lend them, so that the benefits can be truly given to the farmers.

Regarding the distribution of increased value of agricultural land harvest, the reporter is willing to specially emphasize this point, because the distribution of agricultural land harvest is often the landlord, tenant, and government. Now, the increased value of agricultural land harvest is naturally coveted by the landlords. They will try their best to occupy the largest part, so we must plan ahead before the event, so as not to cause disputes in the future. The messenger believes that the Agricultural Promotion Committee is purely for the promotion and improvement of nature, hoping that this time the harvest will increase in value, and the next time the harvest will increase in value even more, hoping that the harvest will increase in value here, and the harvest will also increase in value elsewhere, so the government has the intention of rewarding farmers for increasing production. If the government occupies a very large part of the increased value of the harvest, then the farmers will feel that they have worked hard for nothing, and naturally they will become passive. Therefore, even if the government wants to collect the increased value, it should also be a small number in the percentage, and the landlord should have no right to intervene. According to Sun Yat-sen's principle of people's livelihood of equal land rights, it shows that the increased value of land has nothing to do with the landlord. We are still in such a situation today because we are favoring landlords and have not truly implemented the principle of people's livelihood. Therefore, after this grain production increase, the increased value of the harvest should not be distributed to the landlord, so that the tenant farmers or self-cultivating farmers will get the greatest benefit, and farmers in all places will follow suit, then in less than five or six years, Zhejiang's agriculture will not be as bad as it is today.

We believe that in addition to increasing production, the Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural Promotion Committee will also carry out other things in order, such as the construction of rural roads, the improvement of rural life, and the transformation of agricultural tools. We have endless expectations for this beautiful vision!

### Insufficient Supply of Supplementary Materials to Eradicate Smuggling and Black Markets - Partially Open Self-Provided Foreign Exchange - The Import Management Committee is Studying Implementation Details

Huo Baoshu, Chairman of the Import Management Committee, returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning and immediately convened a meeting. First, Huo reported on the "Application Method for Overseas Chinese Capital and Domestic Deposits Abroad to Invest in Production Enterprises" approved by the Executive Yuan, and immediately exchanged opinions and decided to start drafting implementation details. It will be announced and implemented when the Executive Yuan's order officially arrives. According to reporters, the main purpose of the above method is to partially open self-provided foreign exchange imports. All domestic deposits abroad are limited to those deposited before the end of June 1948, as certified by the bank, while overseas Chinese capital must be certified by our local consulates. As for the types of imported goods, they will not be limited to Annex 1 and Annex 3. Some daily necessities and secondary items in Annex 2, such as rice, cotton, and fertilizers, will also be approved for import in appropriate amounts. Officials commented that the above method is to supplement the shortage of domestic materials and eradicate smuggling and black markets in order to stabilize prices. The government can still absolutely control the quantity and types of imports. As for the quotas for each season in the future, they will not be reduced as a result, so it will not hinder the interests of legitimate importers. After the increase in raw material imports, exports of manufactured goods can be increased, so it is believed that the above method is absolutely beneficial.

### Faltering and Soft Shanghai Stock Market, Slightly Firm Towards the Close

For most of yesterday, the Shanghai stock market was not optimistic. The two trillion production loan, granted to various Shijie Datong bookstores, had already been released. This, coupled with a significant outflow of funds from the national banks for exchanges, led to a recovery, with prices rebounding slightly towards the close.

Opening prices reflected concerns, and most stocks saw declines. Wing On Textile opened at 11,250 yuan. Numbers 69, 224, 65, 180, and 171 took advantage of the low prices to absorb shares, briefly pushing the price up to 11,540 yuan. However, tight credit conditions led to selling by numbers 71, 143, 61, 173, and 60, causing the price to fall back to 11,150 yuan. Slight replenishment by numbers 158, 205, 76, and 71 led to a modest rise to 11,320 yuan. Numbers 065, 179, 207, and 150 sold, breaking the 11,000 yuan barrier. Numbers 160, 173, 97, and 4 bought in, pushing the price back up to 11,170 yuan. However, as the news of the decline in cotton cloth emerged, many short sellers, pressed for time, led by numbers 220, 207, 95, 20, 171, 221, 54, and 169, collectively unloaded their positions. The Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank underwear shares even hit the daily limit down, falling as low as 10,750 yuan, closing the morning session at 10,800 yuan. Besides the Shanghai Mei Lin Company and Union Land shares hitting the daily limit up, and the slightly rising Datong and Hengfeng shares, the Wuhua shares were positively affected by the Zeng Yan affair, rising by half a percent. Except for the steady Sinyi shares, the remaining stocks generally declined by half a percent to one percent.

The afternoon market opened at 11,500 yuan. Numbers 180 and 205 advanced to 11,800 yuan. Numbers 95, 130, 76, 155, 154, 148, 97, 163, 197, 55, and 11 all closed their positions, causing the price to fall to 11,300 yuan. Then, with over two trillion yuan in funds released by the national banks, numbers 179, 193, 145, 176, 205, 152, 89, 196, 102, and 169 collectively absorbed shares, pushing the price up to 11,920 yuan at closing. The remaining stocks also generally rose. Wuhua Weaving finally hit the daily limit up, as did Mei Lin. Compared to the morning close, Wuhua, Mei Lin, and Hengfeng all hit the daily limit up, Datong and Match suffered small declines, China Silk, Shanghai Commercial, Franco-China, Tongyi, and Rongfeng saw small gains, Jinglun was steady, and the rest generally rose by half a percent to one percent. Over-the-counter, unlisted stocks were lackluster.

Government Bonds

Yesterday, the bond market showed weakness. Series C bonds opened at 1.04 million, falling from 1.08 million to close at 970,000. Runde and number 360 sold, while numbers 500 and 552 bought. Over four million yuan worth of bonds were traded. Compared to the previous close, Series A, B, D, and E bonds were each down 100,000 yuan, and Series C bonds were down 90,000 yuan.

### Easing Credit Conditions, Over Two Trillion Released by Banks

Yesterday, credit conditions in Shanghai eased. The four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury experienced a large net outflow in the exchange of bills among the banking and money exchange firms, due to the submission of previously issued cashier's checks for exchange. The total outflow reached 2.3475 trillion yuan. Among them, the Central Bank alone accounted for the largest outflow, with 2.2673 trillion yuan. The Bank of China had an outflow of 667.2 billion yuan, the Bank of Communications had a net inflow of 585.2 billion yuan, the Farmers Bank of China had an outflow of 194.8 billion yuan, the Central Trust of China had a net inflow of 9.2 billion yuan, the Postal Savings Bureau had an outflow of 36.4 billion yuan, and the Central Cooperative Treasury had a net inflow of 223.8 billion yuan. Commercial banks and money shops had a net inflow of 428.2 billion yuan in large exchanges, and 490 billion yuan in small exchanges. Foreign banks had a total net inflow of 1.4293 trillion yuan.

### Financial Management Bureau Strictly Investigates Bad Checks Issued by Banks and Shops

[Our Report] In coordination with policies to suppress price inflation, the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau has, since the end of June, been strictly cracking down on the practice of banks and shops issuing bad checks. It is understood that the Bureau, based on inspections and daily reports of bounced checks from the clearing house, has since June 30th disciplined 119 customers who issued bad checks with relatively minor violations by ordering the banks and shops to cease doing business with them. For the 46 customers with more serious offenses involving bounced checks, the Bureau has not only ordered the banks and shops to cease doing business with them, but has also instructed the banks and shops to report them to the court. The Bureau will continue to vigorously pursue investigations in the future in order to correct the bad habit of issuing bad checks.

### National Bank Stipulates Exchange Measures for Excess Foreign Currency Carried by Entering Passengers

[Our Report] Regarding the amount of foreign currency carried by incoming passengers, and how to exchange the portion exceeding the limit, a person in charge of the Central Bank stated yesterday:

"Foreign currency carried by incoming passengers, beyond the limit of US$100 (or its equivalent in other foreign currency) that passengers may freely carry, should be presented to the Bank on the same day for exchange into national currency at the official exchange rate, or be handed over to the Customs for safekeeping. The safekeeping period is six months. If the passenger is still unable to leave the country after the expiration date and thus unable to claim the currency, the Customs will transfer it to the Bank on the expiration date and convert it into national currency at the exchange rate of the day following the expiration date, awaiting the passenger to come to the Bank to collect it. The Customs will fill out a voucher for the exchange of foreign currency notes and issue it to the passenger, so that the passenger can use this voucher to collect the national currency from the Bank's foreign currency section, but the payment will not be calculated at the exchange rate at the time of collection. As for various foreign currencies that cannot be exchanged, they should also be handed over to the Bank for safekeeping, awaiting the passenger to come to the Bank with the voucher issued by the Customs to collect them. There is no confiscation. Regarding the above-mentioned funds that have been converted into national currency awaiting collection, and the various foreign currencies that cannot be exchanged and are being kept in safekeeping, we hope that those who have not yet collected them will bring their Customs vouchers to the Bank to collect them."

### Sino-Farmers Bank to Pay for Wheat Flour Purchases, Payments to Begin Yesterday

The Ministry of Food has entrusted the Trust Department of the China Farmers Bank with the purchase of 500,000 bags of wheat flour in two batches. It was originally planned that 74 flour mills would undertake the production, but it is now reported that 6 manufacturers are unable to participate due to various reasons, with Fuxin undertaking the largest amount at 120,000 bags, followed by Fufeng at 50,000 bags, and Maoxin at 30,000 bags. Payments for the two batches of wheat flour purchased began yesterday, based on 90% of the market price of 12 million yuan per bag of "Silk Soldier" flour from the day before, which is 10.8 million yuan. One-tenth of this amount, 1.08 million yuan per bag, has been paid, for a total expenditure of 540 billion yuan.

### Abundant Supply Leads to Selling by Retail Investors, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices Both Decline

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market declined due to the upcoming allocation period of the Textile Construction Company, and prices were lowered. The market supply was abundant, and credit conditions suddenly tightened, resulting in sluggish sales. The local market took a wait-and-see approach, and retail investors began to sell. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn initially opened at 1.7 billion yuan, but due to weak buying interest, those constrained by funds were forced to sell, and the price immediately fell by 50 million yuan. However, the reweaving industry absorbed some, stabilizing the market, and it finally closed at 1.64 billion yuan, a decrease of 60 million yuan compared to the previous day. Throughout the day, except for 10-count coarse yarn, which was slightly stronger, other counts of both coarse and fine yarn saw declines of 50 million to 70-80 million yuan, with only 65 transactions.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market declined as banks and shops tightened lending, and inspections of treasury stocks were tightened, causing unease. Furthermore, the Textile Construction Company was set to allocate a large quantity of cloth the following day, and supply was abundant. Credit conditions remained tight, and many long positions turned into sellers. Local door sales were sparse, and although merchants from Tianjin and Hankou made inquiries, fellow traders were selling in droves. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth immediately declined by 2.2 million yuan at the opening. It briefly rose by 300,000 yuan midway, but rumors of profit-taking spread, and many unloaded at the high, causing it to plummet to 44.35 million yuan before selling. It finally closed at 44.45 million yuan, a decrease of 4.7 million yuan compared to the previous day (with over-the-counter prices falling by another half a percent or so). Other various fine cloth, coarse cloth, fine twill, and serge also experienced significant declines. However, colored cloth, grey cloth, shirting, and foot cloth remained stable. It is reported that 2,540 pieces were traded in the morning.

Also, the price of Dragon Head fine cloth sold by the Textile Construction Company in a bid on the 22nd was 44.88 million yuan, while on the market, there were sales at losses of 3 million to 3.8 million yuan. It was last heard that there was a transaction at a loss of 3.5 million yuan, and the market was showing signs of weakness.

Also, the China Textile Company continued to sell 584 bales of yarn yesterday, recovering 786.9 billion in currency. It also sold 207 bales on behalf of the Yarn Management Committee, amounting to 23,846 million. Yesterday, Xinyu and other four factories purchased 1,400 bundles of cotton, at 280 million per picul, recovering 392 billion in legal tender.

### Difficulties in Exporting Tung Oil

Due to unfavorable exchange rates, tung oil exports are difficult. With the current New York delivery price at only 21 US cents per pound, and the Shanghai delivery price at 19.5 cents per pound, converting to a Shanghai price of less than 90 million per picul, it is still impossible to export. It is also learned that the price of Hankou tung oil has also increased due to the rise in exchange rates. After the exchange rate from Shanghai to Hankou increased to only 9.27 billion in Hankou for every 10 billion from Shanghai, the price has also increased to 83 million per picul. When the Hankou exchange rate was at its lowest, with Shanghai delivering 10 billion and Hankou paying out 4.87 billion, tung oil was only over 60 million.

Also, tallow is actively being traded. There were also transactions at 160 million for Homu tallow. Soap factories were actively purchasing. According to industry insiders, it is difficult for prices to rise further in the short term, but it is also not easy for them to fall. Sichuan wax is still quoted at 1.2 billion, but there is not much trading.

### Sluggish Rice Sales and Weak Prices, Wheat Flour, Grains, Oil Cakes Also Decline Slightly

The rice market lacked the momentum to rise. In the early market, the price was quoted higher by merchants due to the high price in Wuxi, but due to tight credit conditions and sluggish sales, the market fell back later. White Japonica and thin Indica rice closed at the same level as the previous day. Extra-grade Japonica also stood at the original price of 43 million. Milled Indica rice fell by 1 million yuan, and the closing was extremely soft. Yesterday, 5,518 shih of goods were registered to arrive in the North and South markets.

Wheat Flour

The market was sluggish due to the continued tight credit situation. Northern merchants sold off and recalled funds, resulting in a sharp decline in the market. Old-brand flour opened at 11.7 million and closed even lower at 11.2 million. "Silk Soldier" flour closed at 10.2 million, and Jiancheng, Red Bee, and others all closed down by 1.4 million to 1.5 million yuan. Wheat bran was down by 300,000-400,000 yuan. In the afternoon, small bags of wheat bran were 6.35 million, and factory prices opened at 15 million.

Grains

There was a general decline due to tight credit conditions, forcing merchants to sell. The market was particularly weak. Soybeans fell by 1 million, and spring broad beans closed at 16 million. Broad beans also fell by 1 million. Corn and buckwheat were purchased by Qingdao merchants, falling by 2 million. Mung beans were firm in the early market but fell by 1-2 million at the close. Sorghum sales were very sluggish, and the market was weak. Sesame was stable due to purchases by Tianjin merchants. Raw peanuts were slightly weak.

Edible Oil

Continuing the weakness of the previous day, there was a further decline, due to tight credit conditions, with both factories and retailers selling off. Soybean oil was traded at 76 million in the early market and fell further to 74 million at the close, a decrease of 6 million. Rapeseed oil also fell by 5-6 million yuan. Jiton rapeseed oil fell into the 100 million range, down 4 million, and was traded at 98 million. Small-scale sesame oil initially opened at 86 million, but was re-raised to 88 million due to Tianjin merchants purchasing, a slight decrease of 2 million. Soybean cake ultimately fell by 300,000-400,000.

### Galvanized Iron Wire and Nails Rise Sharply

Coiled wire and raw silk prices are also high.

The price of galvanized iron wire and nails has risen significantly this year. In February, each barrel was only 4-5 million, but as of now, it has reached around 100 million, and the retail price is as high as 1.2-1.3 million per catty. This is even more dramatic than for Dragon Head fine cloth or solid soap. However, most of the galvanized iron wire and nails sold in the market are manufactured by Shanghai factories. There are now dozens of large and small factories. Because the equipment is relatively simple, small factories can produce with just a nail-making machine, while large factories need to have wire-drawing machines and nail-rolling machines. However, the raw materials, coiled wire and raw silk, have also been very expensive recently, so the cost of raw materials is over 80 million.

### Market Conditions in Various Locations

### Academic Institution Special Interview: Lixin Accounting College

Brief History

In the spring of the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), Pan Xulun founded the Lixin Accounting Tutoring School. Later, realizing that the school's approach focused too much on solving occupational problems, and desiring to fulfill the mission of improving accounting, he believed that establishing an accounting college was essential. Thus, in the spring of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), he actively prepared to establish an accounting college, inviting Chen Qizhu, Wang Yunwu, Song Hanzhang, Qian Yongming, Jiang Hengyuan, and accountants from the Lixin Accounting Firm at the time, including Qian Naizheng, Li Wenjie, and Li Hongshou, to form the board of directors, raising a fund of 170,000 yuan. In April of the same year, the board of directors was formally established, with Chen Qicai and Wang Yunwu elected as chairman and vice-chairman, and Pan Xulun as president. In May, the board of directors submitted a report to the Ministry of Education for record, and in July, permission to open the school was granted. Just as the enrollment examination was completed, the August 13th Incident (Battle of Shanghai) began, hindering school affairs. Subsequently, as the war moved westward and order gradually returned to Shanghai, permission was granted in the summer of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939) to enroll new students, with the new semester beginning on September 1st. In March of the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), land was purchased in Xujiahui, Shanghai, with the intention of constructing permanent school buildings once the war ended. In February of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), the Ministry of Education approved the school's registration, and in July, the first class of students graduated. In December, the Pacific War broke out, and Shanghai fell. In the autumn of the following year, the school moved to Beibei, Sichuan. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), Lixin Building was established in Chongqing, with permission to add a city class. In August of the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), the Anti-Japanese War was won, and the school returned to Shanghai. The Beibei and Chongqing colleges ceased enrolling new students, continuing to operate until all classes graduated.

Current Situation

The school is currently divided into two parts: boarding students on Xuhong Road and commuting students on Changle Road, with a total of 836 students. The professors hired include Li Zhaohuan, Chen Guyuan, Pan Xulun, Wu Benzhong, Wang Guanqing, and others, many of whom are well-known scholars.

The school will enroll first-year, first-semester students in the autumn of the 37th year of the Republic of China (1948). The examination will be held on July 25th, and registration will be accepted from the 19th until the day before the examination, either in person or by written application to the Admissions Committee at 466 Lane, Changle Road, Shanghai, or 213 Zhongshan Road, Nanjing.

### China Industrial and Commercial College

Brief History

The school was founded in Chongqing in the 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944) and moved to Shanghai after the victory. The school is located at 471 Yongjia Road (formerly West Ainsworth Road), with a branch school on Zhu Baosan Road. Next year, the school plans to build additional school buildings next to the Yongjia Road campus, so that the branch school can be moved in as well.

Current Situation

The school is currently divided into two departments: engineering and commerce. The engineering department temporarily has a mechanical engineering major, while the commerce department has three majors: accounting, banking, and business administration, with both day and evening classes. The course is two years long and there are currently eight classes, with 650 students. The chairman of the board of directors is Zhang Qun, the vice-chairman is Huang Yanpei, the president is Shen Sizhuang, and the professors include Ma Yinchu, Du Shousu, Xu Yongzuo, Yang Weiyu, Jiang Wenyu, Zheng Taipu, Zhao Jingshen, and more than 70 others.

The enrollment for the first year of each major, both day and evening classes, is 40 male and female students. The first enrollment date has already passed.

### China Textile Engineering College

The college is a single-discipline independent institution established with donations from the Shenxin Textile Company. It was founded in the autumn of the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), initially called the China Textile and Dyeing Industry College. In the 35th year of the Republic of China (1946), it was upgraded to a four-year university and subsequently renamed to its current name with the approval of the Ministry. The school is located in the building at 293 Xikang Road, with two departments: textile and dyeing/chemical engineering. Important professors include Le Hongyuan, Wu Zhongyi, Tang Xinyuan, Pu Zeng'e, Jiang Danshu, Tan Bingxun, Xue Zhaoming, Du Weiping, Li Guochang, and others.

### Our World Games Soccer Team Arrived in London Yesterday Afternoon; Plans to Arrange Several Friendly Matches with the US, Korea, and Other Teams First

[Reuters, Uxbridge World Games Camp, 22nd] The Chinese World Games soccer team arrived in England after a long journey, still in high spirits. They arrived in London this afternoon from Calcutta.

Coach Li Huitang expressed hope to first play several friendly matches with other national teams, including the US and Korean teams. Li said, "Currently, we know nothing about the strength of other teams. I believe that after several days and several friendly matches, we can know how our own strength compares to other teams." The Chinese soccer team is very strong, with six players from the Singapore team who came to England last year. Team leader Dr. Rong Qizhao is confident that the World Games team is far stronger than the Singapore team. They gained a lot of experience during the 35 matches played along the way from China to England. In these 35 matches, they won 25, drew 5, and lost 5.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] It is widely rumored here that the final leg of the Olympic torch relay to Wembley Stadium before the opening ceremony of the World Games on the 29th will be carried out by the British Prince Consort, the Duke of Edinburgh.

The World Games Organizing Committee is keeping the selection of the person to carry the final leg of the torch relay a closely guarded secret, but it is known that the selection has already been made internally.

### Summary of the Yang Mei Case

— Wu Yong

The strange case of Yang Mei's fasting began in mid-May of this year. I regret that I have not been able to practice abstinence from grains. The old newspapers of that month have already been sold for rice, so the exact date cannot be found. However, according to a report on June 1, the case had been "under investigation for 21 days," so the beginning of the strange case should have been on May 9. I have always advocated the principle of loyalty and forgiveness, holding the belief that "everyone should have food to eat," and have no ambition to ask others to starve in order to complete a personal mission, so I was initially not interested in this strange case of fasting. It was not until early June that the matter seemed to alarm the authorities and entered an extremely "subtle" stage that I became solemn and began to carefully study the various news related to the case. Here is a summary for the reference of later scholars.

According to my impression, before June, the strange case of fasting seemed to be limited to the so-called "research" of several doctors in a private capacity. It was not until June 2 that: "The Yang Mei test work decided to establish a 'Technical Committee,' divided into 'Clinical' and 'Research' groups. After the Health Bureau determines the candidates for each group, the next step of Yang Mei's examination can be carried out." Using "political methods" to deal with "scientific" problems, that's how it started. Following this, many people published grand theories, which can be summarized into three major categories: (1) conjecture; (2) advocating research; (3) hoping to obtain results as soon as possible. However, they were not very interested in on-site research.

The newspaper reported on June 6: "Hu Wenxian said: The cause of this mysterious fasting must be found as soon as possible to avoid confusing public opinion." On the same day, the newspaper reported: "The Ministry of Health has not yet issued any instructions on the Yang Mei fasting incident. The Health Bureau has recently submitted a report on the observation of the past three weeks to the Medical Administration Department of the Ministry of Health." The official document began its journey.

The newspaper reported on June 8: The case "caused a sensation in the United States, and American experts will fly to Chongqing."

The newspaper reported on June 10: "Zhang Qun inquired about the Yang Mei incident in great detail and felt it was important. Yang Sen also intends to negotiate with the central government to allocate huge funds to set up a research institution." I just don't know if this "institution" under preparation is the "Technical Committee" presided over by the Health Bureau, which has already been divided into "Clinical" and "Research" groups? The newspaper reported on the same day: "According to a nurse, Yang Mei farts."

The newspaper reported on June 11: "Pharmacist Fan Daoan believes: There may be chlorophyll in the body." This is probably taking the "person" with a round head and square feet as a "plant."

The newspaper reported on June 13: "Li Zhiyu (Director of the Chongqing Health Bureau) has not actively carried out the preparation of the institution for the next step of Yang Mei's examination." The difficulty lies in not knowing "where to start," because "Yang Sen is interested in this matter," but "his specific methods have not yet been clearly expressed." "Therefore, apart from deciding to establish a technical committee at a meeting, there has been no news of further discussion." Director Li "has shown a worried and anxious expression."

The newspaper reported on June 16: "Yang Mei said she wanted to go home. Mayor Yang Sen asked her why. She replied: After returning home, she can sell a chicken and a pig to buy cloth for sewing clothes." It is said that the mayor felt this was very "unique." Mayor Yang also emphasized that "Yang Mei is no longer privately owned by any individual. She has become the research object of scientists all over the world."

The newspaper reported on June 17: "Hospital director Hu Wenxian, who is in charge of Yang Mei's test work, published insightful views on Yang Mei's problem: Where her excrement is hidden is still a mystery, and he advocates studying her urine." Why doesn't he study it directly, but still has to "advocate" it? It doesn't sound like the tone of someone in charge of the test work.

The newspaper reported on June 18: "A Yang Mei appeared in Shanghai."

The radio broadcast on June 26: "Yang Mei has become a puppet." After that, there was no news of this case.

It was not until July 19 that "Yang Mei's Riddle" was "completely unraveled." According to reports: From July 3 to July 15, Yang Mei ate the following foods during these thirteen days: porridge, salted soybeans, white sugar, rice, mashed soybeans, grain husks, potatoes, braised pork, etc. It was also said that she has returned to Jiulongpo. This case caused a sensation throughout the country, lasted for 70 days, and came to an end. Imported rice is still necessary.

Conclusion: In the future, there will inevitably be figures like Renoir coming to China to explore, and its nature is similar to exploring Africa.

### On Teacher Certification

— Yi Jun

The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education has begun to conduct teacher certification again. First to start is the certification for national school teachers. Before long, it is thought that the certification of middle school teachers, teachers of normal schools, and social educators will be held too. This is indeed a very important matter.

A teacher is a role model for children and youth, and even the general public. They shoulder the sacred mission of cultivating the nation's young sprouts, inspiring national wisdom, and transforming national habits. How can just anyone with a round head and square feet be qualified to be a teacher? Deciding whether a person has the qualifications and conditions to be a teacher is extremely important. Therefore, conducting teacher certification is a very necessary thing.

However, there is one point here (a very important point) that needs to be pointed out specifically: "Education" is not entirely equivalent to "teaching." Teaching is only part of the work of education. In the past (and perhaps in the future), when conducting teacher certification, only the applicant's academic qualifications and experience were used as standards, while character cultivation and physical condition were not asked about at all. This is an extremely serious mistake!

In reality, certification like this cannot be called "teacher" certification, but only "teaching craftsman" certification. A person who is qualified to be a teaching craftsman is not necessarily qualified to be a teacher. Look at those who open cram schools, those who rape female students, those who fraudulently claim rations, and those who make unreasonable demands. Are these the behaviors of "teachers"? Is our society not bad enough that we have to ask these people to "set an example"?

Therefore, when conducting teacher certification in the future, it is imperative to take into account the virtue, intelligence, and physical condition of the applicants, and not to be ambiguous about it at all.

Finally, I would like to say a few words outside of this topic, which is: When holding teacher summer seminars, we must not only focus on discussions of teaching methods and techniques, but also emphasize the cultivation of character as an even more important matter.

"Teacher" should be a person of such noble, upright, and promising character!

### Chen Shaobai and Shi Jingran

— Danlin

Chen Shaobai, in the early days of the National Revolution, was one of the "Four Bandits" of revolutionary comrades, along with Sun Yat-sen, Yang Heling, and You Lie. He was also one of the earliest to engage in revolutionary propaganda. Thirteen years before the founding of the Republic of China, he founded the China Daily in Hong Kong.

In the revolutionary movement, Chen shared ideals and aspirations with Shi Jingran, the third sister of martyr Shi Jianru, and the two were deeply in love. Regarding Ms. Shi's life, Chen mentioned it in "A Separate Record of the History of the Xingzhonghui Revolution," saying: "... While Jingran was gentle, meticulous, exceptionally intelligent, and especially decisive. Therefore, whenever Jianru had matters, he would discuss them with Jingran, and Gu Yu (referring to Jianru's elder brother) was sometimes not informed. At that time, a Japanese man named Takahashi Ken was a teacher at a certain school in Guangzhou. Jianru, through his introduction, went to Hong Kong to see Mr. Chen (referring to Shaobai) and subsequently joined the Xingzhonghui. Jingran was also a most enthusiastic person for the revolution, but because her actions were not free, she could not fully carry out her intentions. Therefore, it would not be wrong to say that Jianru's joining the association was Jingran's proxy... Jingran lived with her mother in Macau. When Jianru met with misfortune, Jingran endured the pain and hid it from her mother, scratching out all the records of Jianru's affairs in the newspapers, and forging false information to present to her mother, claiming that Jianru had gone to Luzon... Two years later, at the urging of Ms. Zhang Zhujun (Ms. Zhang is currently residing in Shanghai), Jingran changed her name and went to Guangzhou to run a girls' school. Before a month had passed, she contracted cholera and died within two days."

Jingran passed away at the young age of twenty-two. Chen was deeply saddened by the premature deaths of her and her brother, who were both ardent revolutionaries with unfulfilled ambitions. He also lamented that he and Jingran were already engaged, but had not yet consummated their marriage, and the two had been suddenly separated. Both publicly and privately, he felt endless grief and sorrow. When Ms. Shi's remains were buried in the church cemetery in Sanwanggang, the eastern suburbs of Guangzhou, Chen personally wrote an epitaph for her tombstone, to be preserved as a permanent memorial. The inscription reads: "Heroic ambition, three feet of cold stone. The latecomer should close his eyes, you sit in your dwelling. The national soul desires to be restored, the wise man does not return. Our race grieves, the foreign race anticipates. Jade has encompassed the mountain, the sea is difficult to become water. This humble self stumbles, distant is the confidant. The sky is blue, the earth is yellow, spring dew, autumn frost; the ugly captives are not yet destroyed, how can we comfort the wounds of our nation! Born in 1881, died in 1902, aged twenty-two."

This text does not use many words, but it is mournful and beautiful, and its sentiments are tender and moving. Reading it, one cannot help but have thoughts of heroic figures. In the course of the revolutionary movement, this is a tragic and magnificent historical material.

Furthermore, Feng Ziyou's "A History of the Revolution Before the Founding of the Republic of China" says of Ms. Shi: "Jianru had a younger sister named Jingran, who was well-versed in the revolution and helped her brother Jianru in his revolutionary endeavors. It is said that after martyr Jianru died, two years later, Ms. Jingran passed away. Neither Jianru nor Jingran were married. Gu Yu died of consumption after the founding of the Republic of China. Shi's mother passed away last, enjoying a life of over ninety years. Having witnessed the death and separation of her flesh and blood, she never said a word of complaint. She even regarded it as a regret that her children were unable to contribute more to the country. This was a very rare and virtuous mother, and it is worth mentioning in passing."

### Wang Tao's Hand-Annotated Books

— Qian Dacheng

Recent people who talk about Wang Tao, the Hermit of Tiannan, are quite numerous, with some calling him the "Taiping Scholar," but there is no definite evidence for this. However, this man was overflowing with talent and unwilling to be lonely, and there are many strange anecdotes about him. Looking at his writings and calligraphy, they all deviate from the orthodox path, and he is truly the founder of the "Shanghai School of Literature"! Two years ago, I spent five thousand yuan at the Baicheng Bookstore in Suzhou to obtain his hand-annotated four volumes of "Dengchuang Suohua" (Trivial Talks by the Light of a Lamp) by Yu Xinbo (named Yuan, from Xiushui) (a Daoguang Dingwei edition, which, according to Sun Dianqi's "Bookselling Jottings," should have ten volumes; this copy is incomplete, but Tao was unaware of this), which bore various collectors' seals, such as "Wang Tao's Private Seal," "Ziquan," "Once Collected by Wang Tao," and "Old Glutton of Wuxia." There was also a hand-written postscript, which roughly said: "Yu Xinbo had a tall and strong body, and his head was as big as a five-stone gourd. But his poetry followed the Song dynasty style and was quite delicate. He was an inner-chamber disciple of Jia Jiyu... 'Dengchuang Suohua' is his work on art... When the Taiping rebels went south, you fled in panic, and the printing plates were destroyed by the war. Upon arriving in Shanghai, carrying a letter from a certain prominent figure, he visited the county magistrate Liu Jun Songyan, who suspected it was a forgery and put him in jail, almost leading to disaster; it turned out that Magistrate Liu had been misled by rumors. Although he was later released, he died in poverty. This is also the misfortune of a scholar. Every time I unfold this book, tears well up. In the late fourth month of the summer of Jiashen in the tenth year of Guangxu, I returned from Guangdong and stayed briefly in Spring Shenpu. Written by the Hermit of Tiannan." The words had a sense of shared suffering. According to recent research, Tao was born in the year of Wuzi in the eighth year of Daoguang of the Qing dynasty, which means that he was fifty-seven years old that year. This book was co-annotated with his wife's younger brother, Yang Xingbu, and there are many laughable points in their comments. For example, the original book contained a poem about gu-sao bing (sister-in-law cakes), which said: "For ten years, the unmarried aunt will grow old, for five nights, the widowed sister-in-law cries alone; the Qingnv and Su'e are both cold-resistant (using a line), one ball of bright moon, one ball of frost." Xing Lian first commented, "According to ritual, widows do not cry at night." Tao commented after him, "This comment by Xingbu is extremely pedantic! A widow's poem has the line 'Five watches are like passing through five heavy barriers.' I wonder how Xingbu would interpret this?" This is similar to the content of recent Shanghai erotic publications, and frivolous writing was pioneered by Tao? In his later years, Tao still enjoyed visiting brothels, but he was restrained by his wife. In a letter to a friend, he described his plight, saying: "The world is not lacking in beautiful women, but in my boudoir, there remains only a plain woman. Although the position is vacant, it is still set up. The zither is in the imperial presence but not played. Occasionally, in my leisure time, I accompany two or three like-minded friends, carrying wine to see the flowers, but this is merely for entertainment, and restrictions follow immediately after. Every short step is hindered, and thorns grow. A moment of joy cannot match a thousand words of scolding. Every inch of sky and foot of land is constrained. This is truly a suffering being in the dusty sea... " He spoke in detail and was not ashamed. Later, he even came to Wumen alone, calling himself a "runaway from his wife." However, his literary talent and elegance shone through an era. Books like "Songyin Mantan" were in everyone's hands, and people like Hu Shi repeatedly corroborated his year of death. Is this also searching for the hidden and acting strangely, so that later generations have something to recount?

### Miscellaneous Poems from Yilou

— Shi Shufan

Met with Ebu, Busanmu, Zihe, and Yuangan in Yilou during the rain. Ebu delights in Chan meditation, and I also stopped drinking, savoring the flavor of emptiness. I have never had such an experience before.

Severe heat and rain accompany thunder, the vegetable planter sits unconcerned as his strength wanes. Planting connects heaven and waste, and rejoins the night sea. Who pities the horizontal hardship and pure poems? The light of the mind-source lamp diminishes, and the affairs of the world gradually become clearer. Do not speak of the dreams of fur coats and horses of yesteryear, famous names of books are known everywhere in the Jianghu.

Inkstone Water

The eaves spider idiotically weaves a web before the wind, inkstone water quietly produces June ice. Springing up like a tide, Guan Zhuang's spirit, casually waving a cattail fan to swat mosquitoes.

Washing while sitting in the Milky Way truly becomes waves, mosquito formations break encirclement without needing a knife. Tonight, the landscape of Jiangshan is truly wondrous, the blue sky is like an urn, the bean fence is high.

### A Record of Bowl Lotus

— Wang Yunan

My brother-in-law, Mr. Di Yongshang of Liyang, lives in Wu, Suzhou, and has devoted his life to education. He has a passion for flowers. Knowing that I share the same hobby, he presented me with a precious double-tiered bowl lotus and told me that it is commonly known as "bowl fortune." However, what is usually seen is that lotus seeds are cultivated, and the initial blooming is small and representative, suitable for pure offerings on the desk. After a year, the lotus root becomes large, and the bowl cannot contain it, and the flower also resembles a regular lotus. This one is relatively rare, with double petals spreading out, like the lotus seat of a Buddhist disciple, and the lotus seedpod does not produce seeds, with multiple flowers stacked on top of each other, hence the name double-tiered. Cultivation is extremely difficult, requiring watering several times a day, fertilizing regularly, and exposing it to the sun and dew while avoiding strong winds and sudden rain. If it is moved, the direction cannot be changed, or it will not bloom. In winter, it should be properly stored, and uneven dryness or dampness, or frozen soil, will easily rot the lotus root. If properly maintained, the roots can be divided into two pots the following spring. Initially, a certain former Governor of Anhui obtained it from a large monastery in Anhui, carried it back to Suzhou, and cultivated it carefully. He divided it into multiple pots, and when he met someone with the same passion, he was generous in giving away cuttings, but he hoped that they would be carefully taken care of and that the roots could be divided and flowers bloom the following year. Unfortunately, over the years, few have been able to live up to expectations, so this species has become increasingly rare and precious. Only Master Lu of Jinsu Keyuan is skilled in cultivation. Most of those who cultivate this flower in Suzhou entrust it to Keyuan for cultivation, and they take it back for viewing during the flowering season. I live as a guest in Shanghai, relying on the city government, and I am pressed for time every year. The official documents are tiring, and the bustling city sounds are unbearable. Whenever I have free time, I often stroll through the flower market to relieve my boredom, but rare treasures are hard to come by, which makes me feel disappointed. Now, facing the famous flower every day, my troubled heart is cleansed. The initial bud has already bloomed in full, and the next bud is also waiting to bloom. Therefore, I brought it to the industry and shared it with my fellow enthusiasts. I am grateful to Mr. Yu Chuoshuo, the founder of Shen Bao, for providing photography (see picture), and I humbly describe the outline to express my gratitude. [Editor's note: There are double-tiered bowl lotus in my Suzhou home, and I have even seen a double-stemmed one. I wonder how they are this summer. The official documents are tiring, and thinking of this often leaves me feeling lost.]
