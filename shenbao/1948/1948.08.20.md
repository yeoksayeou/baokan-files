[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The financial and economic emergency decree issued by the President was first proposed for discussion at the Central Political Committee of the Kuomintang held at 3:00 PM on the 19th and was approved. The meeting was personally presided over by President Chiang. Premier Weng Wenhao presented a report, and Finance Minister Wang Yunwu also attended the Central Political Committee meeting to report. The discussion was detailed and lasted for three hours, ending at 6:20 PM. After the meeting, all committee members kept the matter confidential. However, Weng Wenhao immediately took the plan to the Executive Yuan and presented it for discussion at the Executive Yuan Council, which lasted for three hours, ending at 9:40 PM. The proposal was then announced as passed and it was decided to implement it with immediate effect.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] The new economic reform plan and currency system reform issue, which the people of the whole country have been paying attention to and deeply hoping for for a long time, were finally passed at the Central Political Committee of the Kuomintang and the Provisional Executive Yuan Council held successively at 3:00 PM and 6:00 PM on the 19th. The President, in accordance with the provisions of the Temporary Provisions for the Period of National Mobilization for the Suppression of Rebellion, promulgated a financial and economic emergency decree to implement it, to control finance, dredge materials, and achieve the effect of stabilizing the market. The decree prioritizes currency system reform, issuing Gold Yuan Certificates and its metallic subsidiary coins with full reserves to recover Legal Tender and rebuild a sound currency system. The Gold Yuan Certificates have sufficient reserves. The decree specifically stipulates that the existing gold, silver, and foreign currency of the national government shall constitute 40% of the reserve, with the remainder being guarantee reserves, which can be said to be sufficient reserves, which can achieve the stability of the currency value of the Gold Yuan Certificates that will soon be in circulation. At the same time, the total amount of Gold Yuan Certificates issued has been rigidly limited to no more than 2 billion yuan, eliminating the endless issuance of the past. In terms of credit, it should be able to further consolidate the foundation of the new currency. Secondly, the decree stipulates that issuance shall be made public, and a supervisory committee for the issuance reserve shall be jointly formed by the government and social figures to supervise the quantity of issuance and conduct strict inspections, and to announce it at any time. This measure, which can enhance people's firm confidence, is unprecedented in past currency issuance. According to this plan, the result of careful research and overall planning by Premier Weng and relevant personnel. Secondly, the ratio between the Gold Yuan Certificates and Legal Tender, US dollars, and silver dollars can be referenced by the market price, so there will be no major impact at the beginning of the reform. As for the "Measures for the Registration and Management of Foreign Assets Held by the People" and the "Measures for Reorganizing Finance and Strengthening Financial Control", the former has been criticized by the national opinion circles and public opinion institutions for a long time, but has not been resolved. The latter is some current issues, realistic matters caused by currency system reform, have been stipulated, such as the treatment of civil servants and the stability of prices of public utilities, etc., will have good development. The promulgation of this order makes some people think that long-awaited plans and plans can be made in finance.

### Prices Show a Downward Trend, People in Shanghai, Suzhou, and Zhenjiang are Encouraged

[This Newspaper Report] When the news of the currency system reform was transmitted to the city last night, the streets and alleys immediately became the subject of conversation. Responsible persons in the financial community adopted a reserved attitude towards this move because they had not obtained the full text of the measures, and believed that the appropriateness of some technical measures was closely related to the success or failure of the currency system reform. It is generally believed that the government's resolute reform of the currency system must have considerable confidence in foreign exchange and reserves, and the prerequisite for the success of the currency system reform is sufficient reserves. In terms of the impact of this move on prices, it is generally believed that a slight degree of confusion is almost inevitable, but because of the holidays of the silver and money industry, there will be a lack of cash on the market, and at the same time, the relevant authorities will inevitably take strict supporting measures, and prices will have a downward trend in the short term.

[This Newspaper, Wuxi, 19th] The news of the currency system reform arrived in Wuxi after 9:00 PM, so the commercial sector did not see any impact. However, the general mentality was to buy goods, but because all industries had closed at night, there was nothing to buy.

[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 19th] After the news of the currency system reform reached Suzhou, the market suddenly became excited and chaotic. People were nervous and prices of all goods fell. The silver and money industry held an emergency meeting and decided to close for two days and reopen on the 23rd.

[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 19th] Tonight, after the news that the government decided to implement the economic reform plan was conveyed here from Beijing and Shanghai, because the night market transactions in Zhenjiang were scarce, the market reaction was still tentative. However, the general public expressed great encouragement because the new economic plan will definitely have a good effect on stabilizing prices.

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 19th] After the order for all banks and money houses in the country to take a two-day holiday from the 20th arrived, prices of all goods in the Beiping market plummeted. Green Sunshine City cloth plummeted from 150 million to 88 million.

### Zhang Qun to Visit MacArthur in Japan to Exchange Views on the Entire Far East Situation

[This Newspaper Report] Zhang Qun and his wife arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM on the Qiantang train and will fly to Japan on the 21st for a short inspection.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 19th] Senior American officials in Tokyo are very interested in Zhang Qun's visit to Japan. Zhang is expected to arrive in Japan at the end of this week, and shortly after arriving, he is expected to visit Marshal MacArthur. It is reported that MacArthur is looking forward to General Zhang Qun's arrival and is prepared to exchange views with him on the entire Far East situation. Although Zhang's visit to Japan is nominally private, it seems certain that he will be regarded here as President Chiang's representative and will be treated with due dignity. In some ways, Zhang's visit to Japan is similar to Chen Lifu's visit to the United States. It is believed here that Dewey will definitely be elected this year, and that the foreign policy of the Dewey government will include efforts to support the Chinese government's attempt to annihilate the Communist army. It is generally believed here that in anticipation of Dewey's election, President Chiang is waiting for detailed reports from Chen Lifu and Zhang Qun on the attitude of the leaders of the American Republican Party.

Editorial

### Currency System Reform Has Been Implemented

Opinions on reforming the currency system have always been divided into two factions: one advocates immediate reform, believing that the economy will not stabilize without reforming the currency system first; the other advocates preparing first and initiating reform only when conditions are met and the timing is right, otherwise a new form of legal tender will replace the existing legal tender, which will not benefit the country's economy and people's livelihood.

Among the reform proposals, there are many differences of opinion on the standard of the new currency. Most Chinese people tend to focus on managed currency, i.e., a planned paper currency standard. The reason is that restoring hard currency, whether gold or silver, is no longer suitable for the trend of the times, and China is not a country that produces gold or silver, and it is impossible to store enough hard currency in a short period of time.

Now the currency reform plan has been explicitly ordered by the President, and four methods, including the issuance of Gold Yuan notes, have been passed by the Central Political Conference and the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Conference yesterday. The main points are (1) adopting the gold standard, with four new currencies equal to one US dollar, and three million legal currencies equal to one new currency; (2) gold will be recovered by the state, and silver dollars will also be recovered by the government, with the price set at two new currencies equal to one silver dollar. This measure has solved the above two problems, and the timing and standard of the reform can be said to be decisive. This is a major event worth noting in China's economic history.

The fact that 3 million legal currencies are equal to one new currency inevitably reminds people of the fact that counterfeit currency was 200 times the legal currency. However, the new currency is four yuan, which is equivalent to one US dollar, which is not far from the recent foreign exchange black market, so there is not much actual loss, and it is closely linked to the US dollar. The value of this rate can be expected to be consolidated from now on, which is completely different from the situation where counterfeit currency is converted into legal currency. Therefore, if the point that four new currencies are equivalent to one US dollar can be maintained accurately and never changed, then not only will those who have special legal currency not suffer losses, but also because of the stability of the currency value, it will definitely have a very good impact on prices, finance and other aspects. That is, the salary dispute between labor and capital, the hoarding trend of maintaining the value of the currency, and the large amount of floating capital that cannot be returned will also be gradually resolved because of the stability of the currency value. The government, in its busy schedule, resolutely decided to promptly decide on this major currency issue and put it into practice. The focus is also on this.

We believe that what is most commendable about the Gold Yuan note issuance method is that it establishes the issuance reserve. The regulations clearly stipulate that 40% of the issuance reserve must be gold and silver and foreign exchange, and the rest must be valuable securities and state-owned assets designated by the government. This shows that the government has sufficient confidence and preparation before reforming the currency system. In addition, the total amount of Gold Yuan issued is also determined to be limited to 2 billion yuan, and the value of the issued amount will naturally be stable when the issuance amount is limited. In addition, the issuance of new currency must be completely independent and the amount issued must be announced to the public at any time in order to show great faith to the people. Therefore, the regulations also stipulate that a Gold Yuan note issuance reserve supervision committee will be established to manage matters such as the inspection and storage of the reserve. From several points of view, the government has been preparing for a long time for this issuance of Gold Yuan notes, and it can be said that it has met the necessary conditions for currency reform.

However, we believe that it must be pointed out that gold is an important tool for paying international debts. When the new currency system is closely linked to the US dollar, it is a legitimate method to implement the recovery of state ownership in order to enrich funds. The key is whether the fixed exchange rate is truly in line with the market price, so that people who hold gold are happy to accept it. If the central bank's posted price deviates too much from the actual market price as in the past, then the government's redemption price will inevitably be exactly the same as the central bank's posted price, and it will still become a mere formality. Although the law stipulates that holding gold is not allowed beyond the time limit, whether the people's gold can be returned to the national treasury in full is still a question. However, the fact that the legal currency has been flowing for more than ten years and the silver dollar still has a market price and is still circulating in many places can be used as proof.

In addition, the amount of current legal currency is very large and the circulation is very wide. If the new currency is launched on the market in a steady stream and is fully supplied, it may not be possible to recover all of it within a considerable period of time. For the sake of facilitating people's payments, we cannot but hope that the government will set a broad deadline and order all banks to redeem them separately to avoid difficulties, but we must also determine the temporary period of validity and explicitly announce the termination of issuance, so as to avoid the confusion of new and old currencies and increase currency inflation. Now the issuance of legal currency has been explicitly ordered to stop, and there is an expression that the issued ones will be recovered within a limited time. In the future, how to effectively implement this order is the responsibility of the competent authority.

In short, reforming the currency system is originally an extremely important matter. In this transition between the old and the new, there may be some technical problems that force all parties, public and private, to endure considerable trouble, but in order to consolidate the future of the new currency and reduce the harm to the people, the authorities should strive to avoid all possible abuses and set a new and refreshing indicator in politics.

### US Aid Construction Fund: 70 Million US Dollars; No Disagreement between China and the US on Freezing Part of the US Aid Sales Funds; Leighton Stuart and Yen Chia-kan Host Reporters

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Leighton Stuart and Yen Chia-kan jointly hosted reporters on the morning of the 19th to report that the amount of the US aid industrial construction fund has been determined to be 70 million US dollars. Among them, 35 million US dollars are for supplying industrial parts that China lacks, and the use of the other 35 million US dollars has not yet been determined. In order to implement the industrial construction work, China and the US will jointly establish a small group meeting, with two members from the US and three from China. The candidates have not yet been determined.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th] Yen Chia-kan, Liaison Commissioner of the US Aid Utilization Committee, stated in response to inquiries at the joint reception on the 19th that the partial freezing of the proceeds from the sale of US aid materials is stipulated in the Sino-US bilateral agreement. There is no disagreement between China and the US on this point. What he and Leighton Stuart denied in the joint statement issued in Shanghai a few days ago was that the matter was not discussed at the joint meeting on the 13th and there was no decision to be made. The Shanghai newspapers mistakenly regarded the two men's statement as a disagreement between China and the US on the freezing, which was a misunderstanding. Leighton Stuart also stood up and said that there was no difference of opinion between China and the US on the freezing of part of the proceeds from the sale of US aid materials.

### Marshall Talks About Military Aid to China: China Only Requests 16 Million Yuan; 200 US Trainer Aircraft Sold to China

[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] Secretary of State Marshall said at a press conference today that China has clearly requested only 16 million yuan worth of military supplies from the 125 million yuan in aid to China.

Ambassador Gu Weijun's purpose in visiting is to urge the payment of 125 million yuan.

Marshall did not comment on Senator Bridges' statement that the delivered materials were only worth 9 million yuan. He also declined to disclose the actual amount that has been shipped to China.

Senate sources were surprised by Marshall's statement that China has only requested 16 million yuan worth of military supplies so far, saying, "Obviously, China needs more than that and is negotiating to increase it." They also said, "However, what Marshall is referring to may be the actual requests that have been submitted." A certain person said that the US aid to China plan has not been implemented for a long time, saying, "In fact, the work has been going on for less than a month since July 28, when the 'proceed' instructions were received. He said: "It is believed that this drama will be accelerated and the 125 million yuan will be exhausted by January next year. He continued: "China wants to be as cheap as possible, which has caused many delays in the negotiations. He said that official documents used to be a major obstacle to the implementation of the plan, but now most of them have been eliminated.

### Strict Prohibition of Strikes and Class Boycotts Based on Laws and Regulations: No Need for Legislative Procedures; Director Dong Answers Reporter Inquiries

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th] The Executive Yuan's Information Bureau held a press conference today, and Dong Xian-guang answered reporters' inquiries as follows:

(Question) The Executive Yuan announced four key points on strictly prohibiting strikes and class boycotts. Is this a new measure? Or can it be regarded as a reaffirmation of existing regulations or laws? If it is a new measure, does it need to be passed by the Legislative Yuan or approved by the President? Even if the police do not have a search warrant, they can enter and search private residences. Does this constitute a repeal of some constitutional rights? If so, does it need to be approved by the President using the emergency powers granted by the National Assembly? Newspapers here have repeatedly revealed that several measures are being drafted based on this emergency power. Is this news confirmed? If so, will it include postal and telegraph inspections as reported?

(Answer) The Executive Yuan issued an order to administrative and security agencies in various places on the 17th to eliminate espionage activities, stabilize local order, and strictly prohibit bandits from inciting workers to strike and students to boycott classes. These are all based on existing laws and regulations and do not need to go through legislative procedures. In addition to the provisions of the Criminal Law, the Measures for Maintaining Social Order promulgated by the National Government on May 18 last year, and the Outline for Mobilization to Suppress Rebellions and Complete Constitutional Implementation promulgated by the National Government on July 18 of the same year, clearly stipulate measures for stabilizing social order and suppressing actions that disrupt public order such as strikes, class boycotts, and mass marches. As for pursuing criminals and arresting defendants who resist summons or detentions, judicial police can enter residences and other places and conduct searches directly in accordance with the provisions of Article 131 of the Criminal Procedure Law even without a search warrant. These legal measures do not affect the basic rights granted to the people by the Constitution.

There is no news to report regarding the proposed implementation of emergency measures. I have not heard of the so-called postal and telegraph inspections reported in the newspapers. However, in martial law areas, the local supreme military commander has the right to conduct postal and telegraph inspections in accordance with the provisions of the Martial Law.

### Special Criminal Court Indicts Students, Hu Shih Advises Students to Appear in Court, Saying the University is Not a Concession but a Paper Tiger

[Special Dispatch from Peiping, Our Newspaper, 19th] Hu Shih, in response to reporters' questions about the Special Criminal Court's indictment of students, said: "I have always advised students to abide by the law, and at the same time, I hope the government will proceed according to basic legal procedures. Now that the government has issued summonses, students should appear in court. If the school needs help legally, it can ask law professors for assistance. I have repeatedly told students that the school is not a concession but just a paper tiger. If everyone abides by the law, the paper tiger can still be maintained. If they don't appear in court, they are all young men in their twenties, and the school cannot force them to go." However, it is said that 43 of the 71 students from Peking University who were summoned voluntarily gave up their enrollment two months ago and their whereabouts are unknown. Everyone speculates that most of them have gone to the "Liberated Areas." If the speculation is correct, then four-sevenths of the names on this list are accurate. But I cannot point out who has gone to the "Liberated Areas," who is a Communist, nor can I say that there are absolutely no Communists here. Today, more than two hundred students held a meeting and decided not to appear in court, which does not represent the entire student body and is also a violation of the law." Hu Shih also stated: "The Central News Agency's dispatch on the 17th regarding the Executive Yuan's order issued on the 17th to local administrative security organs, listed four points for attention. The first point stated something about Article 3 of the Criminal Procedure Law. I have thoroughly searched Articles 3, 13, and 130 of the Criminal Law, and there is no such regulation. I am afraid it is a mistake for Article 131, Section 3." It is reported that Hu Shih will meet with the authorities of the Special Criminal Court at 5 p.m. today.

### Three Allied Envoys Meet with Molotov, Negotiations Expected to Reach Compromise, Stalin May Attend Final Talks

[Our Newspaper Report] London 19th Broadcast Moscow News: The British, American, and French embassies were quite busy on the 19th. However, as of noon, there were no new appointments with Molotov. The three envoys may request to meet with Molotov on the 20th. Negotiations between Western countries and the Soviet Union on the Berlin and German issues seem to have reached a critical stage. The three envoys are currently preparing for their final meeting. The American spokesperson seems more optimistic than in previous days, but said that the initial talks were easier and it is difficult to predict what will happen in the future. It is not yet known whether Stalin will attend the next meeting, but it is believed that Stalin will definitely attend the final talks.

[Agence France-Presse London 19th] According to reliable sources: British Foreign Secretary Bevin has new instructions for Roberts. It is believed here that the main content of these new instructions is to urge the British special envoy to be able to meet with Stalin within 48 hours for another round of talks.

[Associated Press Berlin 19th] The "German News Agency," licensed by the Soviet Union, reported from Moscow on the 19th that the final meeting between the special envoys of the United States, Britain, and France and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will be held on the 19th or 20th. The report also said that Moscow diplomatic observers believe that an agreement on the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss the German issue will be reached by the end of this week. The news agency also said that Western countries are expected to attempt to hold another meeting with Premier Stalin before the agreement is completed. Soviet-controlled newspapers only publish Moscow reports, and conversely, focus on the Western powers' plans to control the Ruhr area and establish a West German government. Some believe that at this time of the Moscow negotiations, repeating these two old tunes indicates that the Kremlin is reiterating that West Germany and the Ruhr are the price for any agreement. American diplomatic representatives in Berlin said that they have not received any reports of a foreshadowing of the Four Power Conference, and they are also not aware of whether the Moscow negotiations have entered the final stage.

[Agence France-Presse Washington 18th] Although pessimistic news came from the Moscow talks yesterday, the general public is now cautiously optimistic about the outcome of the talks. Well-informed sources estimate that there is a 70% chance of success in the meeting. The same sources expect the Soviet Union to agree to lift the blockade of Berlin, and the Western powers to agree to the circulation of Soviet currency throughout Berlin, as an exchange condition. As for the issue of the status of West Germany, it will be left to the Foreign Ministers' Conference to resolve.

### United States Refuses to Recognize New Danube River Convention

France Expresses Determination to Maintain Its Entitled Rights

[Agence France-Presse Prague 19th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky flew here from Belgrade today, accompanied by Czech Foreign Minister Clementis and his delegation.

[United States Information Service Washington 18th] The State Department announced tonight that the United States cannot accept the draft Danube River Convention imposed by the Soviet Union on its satellite states at the Belgrade Conference. The State Department said that the document signed in Belgrade today failed to ensure freedom of trade and equal trade, and did not implement the orders of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. The statement also said, "The actions of the Soviet delegation clearly show the Soviet Union's determination to extend its economic and political enslavement of the nations along the Danube River. The Soviet Union's refusal to accept provisions that guarantee genuine commercial freedom and equal treatment has closed one of the main gateways for East-West trade. The Soviet delegation's rhetoric of 'freedom of navigation' is purely empty and has no substance."

[Agence France-Presse Paris 18th] French Foreign Minister Schuman told the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee tonight that the French government will file a complaint with the International Court of Justice regarding the Danube River Convention passed in Belgrade today. He believes that there has never been an opening meeting where the East-West opposition was as obvious as it is today. He emphasized that France's rights under the 1941 treaty must be maintained, and France will not ratify any treaty that disregards France's rights.

### Large Armies Gather on Balkan Borders, Soviet Union Intends to Overthrow Tito, Assassination of Yugoslav Generals Who Fled is Noteworthy

[Agence France-Presse Vienna 18th] The People's Party mouthpiece "Wiener Tageblatt" stated that the Cominform is preparing a military plan to deal with Yugoslav Tito's rule. It is heard that large armies have gathered in certain areas of the Balkans, preparing to impose sanctions on Yugoslavia. It is also heard that there are movements in the Czech, Hungarian, and Yugoslav areas, which proves that the conflict between Tito and the Cominform has caused alarming repercussions in other People's Democratic countries. According to the newspaper, the deployment of large armies in important locations is not intended to take direct military action against Yugoslavia, but to put pressure on "a certain Balkan country" to make it yield. It is even expected that this action will be taken on August 23.

[Associated Press London 19th] Authoritative sources said that the killing of former Yugoslav Chief of Staff Yovanović after crossing the border indicates that the "Cold War" between Tito and Stalin has now turned into a "Hot War." These people said, "This is a continuation and strengthening of the Kremlin's attempt to overthrow Tito. Now that the Danube River Conference is over, we can expect further developments." Similar incidents to the killing of Yovanović have been heard here before, and it is generally believed that the new development in the relationship between Tito and Stalin was delayed purely because Western representatives attended the Danube River Conference in Belgrade. Authoritative Balkan affairs experts here predict that the split between Tito and Stalin will now expand rapidly and may reach its peak in the near future. They said, "This incident is the first sign of the Cold War between Tito and the Kremlin turning into a Hot War."

The Romanian Gazette said that the number of communists in Yugoslavia who oppose Tito is increasing day by day, and Tito's comrade Yovanović is one of them. "When the Yugoslav communists struggle to liberate the Republic of Yugoslavia from the terrorist regime of traitors who destroy Yugoslavia's freedom and independence and endanger the peace of all countries, their resistance cannot be submerged by the wave of terror." The Romanian government seized the opportunity of Yovanović's killing to accuse Tito of launching a "mad wave of terror" within the group, arresting and killing all those who oppose Tito.

He said: The Department of Justice has been working on the new anti-espionage law for a long time, and he personally absolutely opposes the use of any "Gestapo" method that would harm the Bill of Rights.

[Our Newspaper Report] Washington 19th Broadcast: President Truman said at a press conference that if the United Nations decides to send United Nations police to Palestine, and other countries agree to participate, the United States is willing to provide its designated portion, but does not intend to send American troops there.

[United States Information Service Washington 19th] At today's press conference, Secretary of State Marshall confirmed that UN Mediator Bernadotte had requested the United States to send another 125 troops to assist in inspecting the Palestine truce. This request was originally sent to the Department of Defense. Bernadotte requested a total of 300 additional inspectors, with the United States and France each sending 125, and Belgium sending 50. These three countries are members of the Palestine Truce Committee recently established by the UN Security Council. Asked whether Bernadotte had requested the dispatch of a larger force to help maintain the truce, Marshall replied that Bernadotte had requested the dispatch of a special force, but his request was presented to the Security Council, and the Security Council has not taken any action on this.

Regarding Bernadotte's request that the United States provide emergency relief supplies to Palestinian Arab and Jewish refugees, Marshall said that the relevant departments of the United States government have discussed this issue. The Secretary of State hopes that American relief organizations will, as always, pay immediate attention to the suffering of the refugees in the area.

### Korean New Government Established for Only a Few Days, Opposition Party Launches No-Confidence Vote, Syngman Rhee Plans to Form New Political Party to Counter

[Central News Agency Seoul 19th] It is reported that members of the Datong Youth Corps (led by Yi Cheong-cheon) and members of the Korean Democratic Party (led by Kim Seong-soo) who are dissatisfied with the current cabinet are joining hands in an attempt to reorganize the cabinet through legal procedures, and will overthrow it. The method is to propose a vote of no confidence in the current government, and with a two-thirds majority of the members, change the presidential system to a responsible cabinet system. If both of these fail, they will take an opposing stance to all bills submitted by the government, and propose bills that are contrary to the government's policies. It is heard that Syngman Rhee, in response to this plan, also intends to recruit cabinet members to form a powerful new political party with members of the Independence Promotion Association (led by Yi himself, with 56 seats in the National Assembly) and a part of non-party members, in order to confront the anti-government faction in the National Assembly. In this situation, it is doubtful whether Korea's administration can be actively promoted.

### Various Organizations in This City Telegraph the Executive Yuan in Support of Measures to Eliminate Communist Spies; Appeal to the Public to Follow Unanimously; Conduct Self-Rectification and Assist in Reporting

Yet they are still unrepentant, using the guise of democracy and freedom, secretly engaging in techniques to harm the country and the people, and creating chaos and destroying society in various rear areas, using every means possible, placing our people under the knife and plunging our compatriots into fire and water. Thinking of this is extremely heartbreaking. The government is bringing solace to the people and suppressing the rebels, and eliminating chaos. Where great righteousness lies, the entire people will follow. However, the communist plots are insidious, penetrating everywhere, using false names and pretenses, enticing the ignorant, deceiving the masses, encouraging the trend, opening up their so-called 'underground front.' If they are not strictly punished, the consequences will be unimaginable. We have recently learned that your Excellency, in view of this, has issued an order to eliminate traitors and stabilize order. This is truly a bright strategy to prevent problems before they occur, and it is urgently needed in this extraordinary period. In addition to sincerely supporting it, our association and others will appeal to people from all walks of life in the city to follow it unanimously, conduct self-rectification, and assist in reporting, so that insidious elements have nowhere to hide, and students and good workers can all be able to settle down in their occupations, and society can be stabilized and secured. Hopefully, everyone will be united and work together to suppress the bandits with all their might and accelerate the completion of the suppression of the rebellion. We respectfully telegraph the facts and hope for your guidance."

### Ten Thousand Tons of Coal Successively Transported to Shanghai; Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Request to Stop Shipments to Japan

[Reported by this newspaper] Amidst the coal shortage in Shanghai, it is now learned that some coal has been successively arriving in Shanghai. The Huahai vessel, loaded with 5,000 tons of coal from Beijing, arrived in port yesterday. The Anlian vessel, also loaded with 2,000 tons of coal from Beijing, is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. Additionally, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haihuang vessel, loaded with 9,500 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao, was originally intended to be transported to Kobe, Japan. Due to the needs of this city, it has also been ordered to be loaded and transported to Shanghai.

### Airmail Newspapers and Publications Sent to Chongqing: Volume Limited to Only 300 Kilograms; Post Office Receives Reporters to Explain the Reasons

[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the temporary suspension of acceptance of airmail newspapers and publications to Chongqing, the Municipal Postal Administration specially received reporters yesterday, and Assistant Director Wang Yuguang of the bureau reported that since last month, China and Central Airlines have reduced the number of flights on various routes due to the lack of gasoline. The company's restrictions on the volume of mail accepted by the post office have also decreased proportionally. The reduction on the Shanghai-Chongqing route is particularly large. There are a total of eight flights per week on this route, and the two companies limit the weekly volume of mail they accept to 2,200 kilograms. According to statistics for July, airmail on the Shanghai-Chongqing route alone for letters and postcards has reached 2,100 kilograms, while newspapers and publications have reached 910 kilograms. The postal service prioritizes letters, followed by newspapers. According to the above statistics, the volume of newspapers and publications is only 100 kilograms. Although the post office has repeatedly negotiated with the airlines, they have only agreed to increase it by 200 kilograms, for a total of 300 kilograms, accounting for one-third of the total demand. This figure also includes the volume on the newly opened Shanghai-Jiujiang-Hankou route. If this route is suspended, the letters will be concentrated on the Shanghai-Chongqing route, and even this one-third may not be able to be transported. Therefore, the post office currently hopes for two things: (1) that the newspaper and magazine publishers will send their mail directly to the airlines; (2) that the volume of airmail newspapers sent by the newspapers will also be automatically reduced to one-third of the July volume. The representatives of the newspapers who attended expressed understanding of the postal service's difficult situation and agreed to report the two suggestions of the post office to the newspaper authorities so that they could collectively negotiate with the airlines.

### [Sweet Girl] Cuts Tongue, Has [Unspeakable] Pain; After Being Sent to the Hospital for Suturing, She Has Recovered

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the "sweet girl" of the film and theater world, Huang Zongying, announced her marriage to the handsome young actor Zhao Dan, she has been working hard day and night on films and plays, and her health has been deteriorating. Moreover, prices are soaring, and life is difficult, causing her to suddenly feel hatred for her artistic career. One morning, she heard Zhao discussing the acting problems of "Beauty Walk" at home, which stirred up her sorrow. Thinking about her current situation, which was entirely due to her participation in theatrical work, and that her ability to enter the film and theater world was entirely due to her "ability to speak well," she suddenly became angry with her "long tongue" and suddenly used scissors to cut off the tip of her tongue, in an attempt to eradicate her troubles. Zhao was shocked to witness this and rushed her to Zhongshan Hospital for suturing. She has recovered as of yesterday, but because the wound has not yet healed, she still seems to have "unspeakable" pain. When reporters asked why she resorted to such a measure, she immediately covered her face with a pre-written note saying "Following doctor's orders, no visitors allowed" and shook her head with a smile. Her entourage explained, "Zongying is still a child at heart!" and added, "She already regrets it now."

### China-America Pharmacy Sued: Suspected of Trademark Infringement

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wang Jie (王　階), Zhang Yaxuan (張雅軒), and Zhang Zidong (張紫洞) have filed a lawsuit in the local court against Xu Xiangsun (徐翔蓀), the owner, and Zhang Changjing (張昌敬), the manager, of the China-America Pharmacy (華美藥房), accusing them of violating the Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Management Regulations. The plaintiffs stated in their complaint that they had issued a "Hundred Cure" ointment with a "Lion Globe" trademark in other regions in 1946, which was registered with the Trademark Bureau. They have now discovered that the China-America Pharmacy is also issuing ointments with a "Lion Globe" trademark, which is highly suspected of trademark infringement, and thus filed a lawsuit. Xu Xiangsun, the defendant, did not appear in court yesterday morning due to illness, but Zhang Changjing appeared and stated that the China-America Pharmacy had been using the "Lion Globe" trademark to issue ointments for more than ten years, and had built up a strong reputation, so they did not apply for registration with the Trademark Bureau. The court stated that since the pharmacy's trademark was not registered, it was indeed inappropriate. The defendant Zhang Changjing was ordered to post 3 billion yuan in cash bail and secure two shop guarantees. The hearing was adjourned, and Xu Xiangsun was ordered to appear in court on time.

### Zhenhai Farmers' Association Stipulates Rent Payment Methods: Landlords Urge Authorities to Take Measures to Stop It

[Our Newspaper's Report from Zhenhai, 18th] Gu Jingyong (顧荆庸), Chairman of the Zhenhai County Farmers' Association, called on all tenant farmers in the county in mid-August to pay rent at 8% of the land price in accordance with the Land Law. In areas where the standard land price has not yet been announced, the average land price of the most recent three years will be used as the land price for paying rent. The tenant farmers have also been notified by the Farmers' Association to pay the land tax for the landlords in advance, as the Zhejiang Provincial Government has ordered tenant farmers to pay and deduct it on behalf of the landlords. In addition to issuing a declaration, the Association has also gathered petition representatives from various townships to petition the relevant ministries and commissions of the National Government, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the Zhenhai County Government, vowing to achieve their goal. They have also sent people around to promote rent strikes, and any landlord who collects rent will be rejected. Landlords in the county report that the annual land tax is 40 catties of grain per mu (approximately 667 square meters). If the rent payment standard advocated by the Farmers' Association is followed, not only will there be no rent to collect, but more than 20 catties of grain will have to be paid in taxes, affecting the livelihood of all those with land holdings. In addition, education, charity, and public welfare undertakings in the county, which rely on rent revenue for funding, will all be suspended. The entire county is in a state of panic, and people are petitioning the provincial and county governments to quickly stop this, reject the Farmers' Association's unreasonable demands, and continue to use the temporary measures for reducing rent by 25% to appease the people.

### Bearish Forces Exert Pressure, Market Trends Decline Sharply, Many Chinese Stocks Fall to Limit, Securities Exchange Announces Closure for Two Days

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were extremely fragile. On the eve of the implementation of the new policy, the Nanjing bearish forces arbitrarily released various rumors. The multi-party was simply a disunited crowd, and immediately collapsed. Many popular stocks fell to the limit or close to the limit. Yong Yarn fell below the limit. Only the cement stock rebounded to the limit due to the arrival of paper bags.

In the early morning, people were concerned about the President's return to Beijing and the economic reforms. The market opened unusually weak, with mostly low openings. Yong Yarn opened at 16,800 yuan, and after opening, rose from 16,850 yuan. Due to unusual weakening in the aftermarket, No. 71, No. 145, No. 154, No. 12, No. 56, No. 13, No. 169, No. 102, No. 148, No. 125, No. 94, No. 220, No. 179, No. 61, No. 116, No. 160, and No. 137 were heavily sold, lacking resilience. After 11:00 AM, Xinhuo first fell to the limit, and Yong Yarn also followed, falling to the limit of 15,280 yuan, before being replenished by No. 153, No. 207, No. 107, No. 148, No. 12, No. 134, No. 137, No. 143, No. 102, and No. 56, rising back to 15,750 yuan. No. 65, No. 35, No. 73, and No. 176 sold off. The midday close was 15,530 yuan. Except for Shanghai Cement, which uniquely closed at the limit, and matches, Tongyi, and Huaxin, which fell only slightly, the remaining stocks unanimously declined by 5% to 10%.

In the afternoon market, the money supply remained excessive. Yong Yarn opened at 15,850 yuan, but soon No. 71, No. 220, No. 152, No. 22, No. 54, No. 4, No. 102, No. 69, No. 99, No. 134, No. 106, and No. 12 hastily closed their positions. Rumors spread that the new policy would be announced that evening, and the brokerages and market would close for three days to wait for the consolidation. Rumors ravaged the multi-party, and Yong Yarn immediately fell to the limit. Xinhuo and Qinxing fell to the limit. No. 176, No. 153, No. 178, and No. 143 maintained, rising to 15,500 yuan. No. 38, No. 16, No. 97, No. 67, No. 145, No. 71, No. 157, No. 4, and No. 190 continued to cut long positions. Meiya also fell to the limit, eventually falling below the limit, reaching a low of 15,120 yuan, struggling at 15,230 yuan at the close. However, after the close, news came that the National Bank had intervened, slightly rising above the limit. Compared to the morning close, Huaxin and Shanghai Cement rose to the limit, China-France fell to the limit and then rebounded, Yong Yarn, Meiya, Xinhuo, and Qinxing fell to the limit, and the rest fell slightly by about 5%. The over-the-counter unlisted stocks were still most popular, such as World.

Government Bonds

Yesterday, hopes for currency reform intensified, reaching new peaks. Class A and B were at 2.2 million, Class C saw 2.91 million, Class D reached 2.3 million, and Class E approached 2.5 million. At the close, they were all closed by the multi-party, ending down slightly by about 10%. Room 552 and Room 550 sold, Room 503, Room 360 and Room 500 bought. Trading volume increased to over 10 million. Except for Class D, which was flat, the rest continued to rise slightly.

Exchange Closure

Also, Shanghai Securities Exchange yesterday issued Market Announcement No. 595: "The bank approved the Central Bank's Shanghai Central Secretariat (37) Letter No. 3012 on August 19 of this year, approving the Ministry of Finance's telegram stating, "It is hereby decided that August 20 and 21 of this year will be temporary holidays for the national banking industry. It is hoped that Shanghai and Tianjin Stock Exchanges will be notified to comply and take holidays at the same time," etc. In addition to the branch, the telex must be checked and handled in the office.

The transactions of the latter market on August 19 will be reconciled at 2:00 PM on the 20th. This is hereby announced."

### Actual Sales are Slow, Outlet is Limited, Rice Prices Hover and Tend to Soften, Flour, Grain, Oil and Cakes are All Downstream

The rice market hovered downwards. The morning opening was due to the firmness of Wuxi, and the owners intended to raise prices, but because the actual sales were slow and the outlet was limited, the price remained at the original level. Later, due to the reports of higher prices for various items outside the industry, people became more nervous and soft, and there were many sellers, so the price slowly declined. In the Nanshi market, white japonica and thin indica rice each fell by 1 million, and the rest were slightly weaker. The prices in the Beishi market were stable, with special high japonica rice standing at 68 million yuan. Yesterday, the total arrival of goods in the North and South markets was 3,532 stones.

Flour fell, actual sales were slow, buyers were hesitant, and the reporter dared not enter rashly in this weak state, so transactions were very idle. Old Car flour fell all the way from 23.1 million to 22.7 million yuan, a decrease of 700,000 yuan. Bingchuan flour was 21.8 million yuan, a decrease of 900,000 yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng were each at 22 million yuan, each decreasing by 600,000 to 800,000 yuan, and Xiong brand flour also decreased by 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Bran also decreased by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, wheat by 31 million yuan, down by 200,000 yuan.

Miscellaneous grains were all weak, because actual sales were sluggish and the buyer's acceptance was narrow. Trade beans fell by 1 million yuan, corn buyers accepted less, and fell sharply by 3 million yuan. The willingness of buyers in Shantou to accept yuan wheat decreased simultaneously, falling sharply by 4 million to 5 million yuan. Broad beans were stable, mung beans fell slightly by 100,000 yuan, sesame transactions were very rare, only local sales, down by 1 million to 2 million yuan, and raw peanut buyers accepted less, with prices falling by 2 million to 3 million yuan.

Edible oil gradually moved downstream. Because the prices of all grains fell, the outlet had already decreased, and because various items outside the industry were also small, people became even more nervous and soft. Soybean oil closed at 156 million yuan, a decrease of 6 million yuan. Rapeseed oil uniquely stood firm, because there was an export outlet, opening at 141 million yuan, rising by 2 million yuan. Raw oil fell by 2 million yuan, and small cart sesame oil fell by 5 million yuan. Soybean cake transactions were sluggish, falling by 700,000 to 800,000 yuan.

### Before the Shanghai Coal Shortage is Resolved, Kailuan Coal Will Temporarily Be Shipped to Japan

[Our Report] According to a revelation from the Fuel Management Committee, the CITIC Bureau originally intended to ship Kailuan coal to Japan in exchange for wood.

### Merchants Going to Japan Order Rayon, Limited to 120 Boxes Each Time

Private trade between our country and Japan is gradually expanding. When selecting imports, most of the private business representatives sent to Japan enjoy purchasing Japanese rayon, because rayon is currently a resource in short supply domestically, and the demand from various silk weaving factories is quite strong. Therefore, the sales of rayon in the country are more guaranteed. Currently, in order to prevent the competitive purchase and sale of Japanese rayon from invisibly raising the value of Japanese rayon, the authorities have specifically limited each trader to purchase no more than 120 boxes of Japanese rayon each time.

### Tea Market Stable

Yesterday, the buying interest of exporters in the foreign tea market was still strong, but the owners insisted on selling firmly due to the scarcity of goods, so the trend continued to be more demand than supply, and transactions were not active. In terms of price, they all rose higher and higher. Inquiries for domestic tea were also constant, and the market was stable and keen.

### Prices of Goods Outside the Industry Generally Decline, Yarn and Cloth All Decrease

Yesterday's cotton market conditions, due to the upside-down price of cargo from the guest land of Sichuan and Tianjin, the guest help stopped entering and sold, and at the same time, negative news spread frequently, people's confidence was depressed.

If the champion US team has an average of ten players with technical skills, any five players will become a strong team. Therefore, it is not without reason that they dominate the world. (5) Improper guidance and scheduling cannot escape blame.

### Master Hongyi and Xu Jiyuan

— Lu Danlin

My literary friend Li Fangyuan came to Fan from Xiamen yesterday and met for several talks. Fangyuan is the great disciple of Hongyi Monk. In the conversation, he naturally talked about Hongyi's anecdotes, which unintentionally reminded me of the story of Hongyi and Xu Huanyuan's life and death, which is a very touching story.

In the biography of Master Hongyi written by Jiang Danshu, there is a passage that says: "He once told Feng Zikai that in the 17th or 18th year of the Republic of China, the Master temporarily lived in his Shanghai residence and chatted about the past. He suddenly wanted to visit Chengnan Thatched Cottage. Zikai accompanied him; when he arrived, the old residence still existed, but the owner had changed, and the Thatched Cottage had been changed to a refined residence; entering, he felt great sorrow for the past and the present, and immediately prostrated himself before the Buddha statue, knocking his head like pounding garlic. The solemn expression, the silence of ten thousand times, the desolate atmosphere, the coldness of the four walls. If my Buddha is spiritual, he should also shed tears of sadness. After knowing that the house had changed hands, he asked where the old owner was. He sincerely sought him, and he found the person. Alas, Xu Huanyuan, the leader of the literary world who was generous and righteous in the past, had white hair and deaf ears, and his haggard state was unbearable to look at, and he was still hiding in a humble room, preparing books for people, exchanging them for a few liters of rice to maintain his livelihood. After meeting, he was greatly saddened again. After a long time, he began to smile through tears, recalling the past, as if a fool was telling a dream. This scene, Zikai, who was sitting with him, couldn't help but wet his beard with tears..." This tragedy, performed by Hongyi who had seen through the dust, precisely showed his profound legal knowledge, his warm friendship, and the full expression of his deep feelings. How could Zikai, who was watching, not shed tears and wet his beard? And Hongyi and Huanyuan, who were involved, each recalling the past, they wanted to cry but had no tears, and could only smile through tears. What a sad and emotional scene!

Xu Huanyuan, whose name is Cai, is from Shanghai. In his early years, he and Cai Xiaoxiang from Baoshan, Yuan Xilian, Zhang Xiaolou from Jiangyin, and Hongyi (who used the name Li Xihe at the time) and others formed a sworn brotherhood. This was thirteen years before the Republic of China, and the location was Chengnan Thatched Cottage on Qinglong Bridge in the city. The following year, they organized the Shanghai Calligraphy and Painting Association at the old site of Yangliu Chess Stand on Fuzhou Road, drinking tea and reading paintings, and publishing a calligraphy and painting newspaper every week. Soon, Zhang Xiaolou was hired by Yangzhou Dongwen Academy, Hongyi entered Nanyang Public School, Xilian entered Guang Fangyan Hall, Xiaoxiang was busy with the hospital, and Huanyuan donated to become an official, so the calligraphy and painting association stopped.

Yuan Xilian's "My Relationship with Da Shi": "...In the 17th year, the Master came to Shanghai and lived in Feng Zikai's house in Jiangwan. I, Xiaolou, and Huanyuan visited him together. At that time, Cai Xiaoxiang had already passed away, and we sighed with emotion, overwhelmed by the feelings of the past and the present. So the four of us took another photo together, and the Master personally inscribed it on it..." This is the same time as recorded by Mei Danshu.

Huanyuan's wife was Ms. Song Mengxian (Zhen), who was skilled in poetry and painting. The couple worshiped Wang Tao and Jiang Biao as teachers. During the Boxer Rebellion in the Gengzi year, Huanyuan and his wife sold their collection of calligraphy and paintings for charity, saving countless people. Ten years before the Republic of China, Huanyuan mourned his wife's death, and his grief was extraordinary. After a few years, he collected inscriptions from domestic literati on the posthumous paintings of Madame Mengxian. At that time, people such as Chen Sanyuan, Yan Fansun, Fan Yunmen, Wu Changshuo, Jiang Guanyun, Chen Renxian, Zhu Jiangcun, and Li Meian all had poems and essays. Hongyi wrote a poem with a small preface, narrating their friendship, which said: "Elder Sister Mengxian learned from Senior Wang Tao, and was able to write articles and poems. She also studied painting with Jing Qing from Ling County, following the family style of Qi Xiang, and was able to obtain its spirit. People at that time praised her for surpassing her teachers. This book was made in the ninth month of the Gengzi year. I was living in Chengnan Thatched Cottage with my mother. During flower mornings and moonlit evenings, my mother always invited Elder Sister to talk about poetry and evaluate paintings, and enjoyed it. Elder Sister was often ill, and my mother treated her with medicine, treating her as her own daughter. On the lotus birthday of the Renyin year, Elder Sister passed away. Three years later, in the Yisi year, my mother also passed away. I then fled overseas and roamed recklessly. Recalling the happy family life and the elegance of singing and harmonizing, it seems like another world. This year, my brother-in-law Huanyuan showed this painting and asked me to write a poem. I grieve for the dead who cannot be resurrected and mourn for the living who have many difficulties, so I compose a short poem to express my sorrow." After reading this small preface, you will know that they were sworn brothers and sisters with different surnames, and their feelings were like flesh and blood. The poem says: "Life is like a dream, sadness and joy reach the heart. Shanghai is left with two lines of tears, chanting into an autumn evening. Kind clouds are in the sky, the bright moon is in the south building. There is no longevity in the world, only a few feathers of Dan Qing remain."

Beautiful women have short lives, famous scholars are bumpy, and Hongyi became a monk as a noble son. The events of the past thirty years, joys and sorrows, separations and reunions, are like a dream. A close friend with deep affection like Master Hongyi naturally couldn't help his "great sorrow" and "smiling through tears." And now, of their fifty-year sworn brothers, only Zhang Xiaolou and Yuan Xilian remain. In recent years, there have been wars and species development in Shanghai. Some write calligraphy and paintings, and some are lawyers, spending their twilight years.

### Ode to Passing Jiayuguan

— Wang Ziyun

I remember passing Shanhaiguan in the east in the past, the border wind blew the moon and illuminated the group, Ju Yong stood on his horse and looked down at Shanggu, grape grapes were piled up with jade plates. Embracing the sound of the ascending car, climbing Yanmen, the inside and outside are divided into Yin and Yang at dawn and dusk, flying far west to Jiayu North, the vast plain is boundless. Meng Gong's Great Wall; horizon, even today the ruins are broken and there are still five thousand miles left; my life is long and I work hard, and I have seen the vicissitudes of life and become a person from east to west, north and south! The insects, sand, apes, and cranes have experienced the dust, crossing the mountains and passes that I am used to; trying to travel with the wind, laughing and pointing at Tianshan to share a white head.

### Picnic at Swallow Nest and Dance Party

A long journey to "Ula Bai", a short stay in "Swallow Nest", a good try at the demon dance under the sky, a real dance on the ground.

An old man with a loud voice has relics, flowing water and high mountains write their own hearts, Wang Zhenjin's emblem is different from the Chinese land, copper silk gently strokes the six-stringed Qin.

### The First Luxurious Giant Liner of the Contemporary Era, "Queen Elizabeth"

— Lan Xin

So far, the largest and most luxurious ship in the world is the British mail ship "Queen Elizabeth". This ship weighs 83,673 tons, is 1,031 feet long, has 14 decks, and has 650 motors of various sizes. The current generated is enough for a small city of more than 100,000 people.

The first-class cabins on the ship all have heating and cooling equipment, bathrooms, and wireless telephones. Passengers can pick up the phone and make calls to any major city in the world.

The ship has two movie theaters, two swimming pools, three gyms, twelve bars, and even Turkish bath facilities. In addition, there are three libraries with 4,000 books printed in 14 different languages. There are also three banks, six shops, beauty salons, and barbershops.

The ship's medical equipment is extremely complete, with a large operating room for performing surgical operations, a regular hospital, and an isolation hospital.

The ship needs to prepare more than 10,000 meals a day, so it must prepare all kinds of food itself. Washing clothes is also an amazing task. Every time it crosses the Atlantic between England and America, the laundry room of the "Queen Elizabeth" needs to wash 10,000 sheets, 20,000 napkins, and 70,000 towels.

When World War II broke out, the "Queen Elizabeth" was not yet completed and was the best bombing target for German bombers. For safety reasons, the British side hurriedly let it risk crossing the Atlantic Ocean full of submarines and sailed to New York in the United States to moor. This was March 2, 1940, the maiden voyage of the "Queen Elizabeth".

In November of the same year, it was ordered to sail to Singapore and converted into a transport ship. Since then, it has continuously transported troops and made great achievements. When the Japanese army spied on Australia, the "Queen Elizabeth" once loaded American soldiers to Australia. It can carry 2,314 passengers in peacetime, but it can carry as many as 15,600 soldiers when transporting troops.

Once, a confused American soldier told his companion on the ship: "Ah, of course only we Americans have this kind of ship. The British will be envious!"

Unexpectedly, this sentence was heard by the captain, Sir Bisse. He immediately ordered the brief history of the Elizabeth to be written down and hung in the public notice area, so that everyone would know that this ship was indeed the product of the British Empire. ,

German submarines certainly did not want to let go of such an excellent moon target, but the "Queen Elizabeth", although large, was extremely flexible and fast, able to travel 30 nautical miles per hour. Those submarines were finally helpless. Hitler also specially issued a reward, and the submarine crew who could sink the ship could receive the highest honor medal of the German army and an additional reward of 200,000 US dollars. But later, checking the records of the German Navy, only one submarine had seen the "Queen Elizabeth" in the refracting telescope - and the submarine's mines had just been used up, so it had to watch it sail away safely.

Hitler's reward was only 200,000 US dollars, but now that the "Queen Elizabeth" has been restored, it can earn 1.3 million US dollars for each round trip between England and America.

3100 years of war;

277 years of peace;

8000 peace treaties.

### Noble and Cheap

— Mei

Bali in the Dutch East Indies is a place with extremely beautiful scenery, and the local girls are especially famous for their fitness. The residents of that island have two strange sayings about twins, one male and one female. The first saying is popular among the nobles, who believe that this pair of children must have been loving couples in their previous lives, so they are still unwilling to separate when they are reincarnated, which is really commendable. The second saying is popular among the common people, which is exactly the opposite of the previous saying. They believe that this pair of babies has committed the great sin of incest before they were born, which is simply a misfortune for the family, so the parents of the pair of children must fast and atone for their sins, spending a lot of money.

### Experiences in Quiet Sitting (3)

— Jiang Wenyu

Now, every time I practice quiet sitting, I silently count my breaths four hundred times. Because each session takes fifteen minutes, completing four sets—four hundred breaths—takes exactly one hour. Also, when sitting in a single lotus position, my lower leg on the right side inevitably becomes numb. I now have a considerable amount of experience with this. Generally, I start to feel the numbness after about thirty minutes, so I switch legs. Therefore, I switch my legs once every time I practice quiet sitting, which has now become a regular habit.

In addition, I have another experience: when first learning to practice quiet sitting, one must sit in the lotus position. After a long time, one can sit on a chair with the legs dangling, which is also acceptable. Recently, I occasionally sit outdoors to enjoy the cool air, close my eyes, and stretch my back. This can also eliminate distracting thoughts. Practicing deep, subtle breathing for an hour makes my abdomen feel warm as usual.

Also, a large amount of saliva is produced in the mouth during quiet sitting. This can also be considered an unusual phenomenon. In my experience, more saliva is produced during evening or afternoon sessions, while very little is produced during morning sessions.

I believe that what I have said above is extremely honest and objective. Unfortunately, I have not been able to record the unusual phenomena I have discovered in detail in my diary. From September 1st of this year, I have decided to prepare a form and use it to record everything daily.

The Effects of Quiet Sitting

Next, I will discuss the effects of quiet sitting further. For example, Jiang Zhu Lao, at the advanced age of seventy-six, has been practicing quiet sitting for more than fifty years. He still has sharp ears and eyes, and strong legs and feet. He teaches, writes articles, and handles various matters every day, just like a middle-aged person. He is, of course, an excellent role model. However, I must not forget the topic. The effects discussed here should be limited to my personal experiences. I have long suffered from high blood pressure. What is the effect of quiet sitting on this condition? I might as well speak in detail: At the end of May in the 35th year of the Republic (1946) when I was in Hangzhou, I had a medical examination. My blood pressure was only 175. At that time, I had only been practicing quiet sitting for a month. In May of the 36th year of the Republic (1947), after another examination, it was found that it had increased to 190. At this time, I had been practicing quiet sitting for a year. How can this be explained? Originally, I had already experienced that my blood pressure was not always high; sometimes it was high, and sometimes it was low. In other words, it was high when the condition flared up, and low when it did not. I myself am clear about when the old condition flared up and when it did not. When the condition flares up, I definitely feel a little dizzy, and there is some numbness in my left leg and left arm (only a small part). My body is not very comfortable. According to my experience, the duration of this phenomenon varies. In Chongqing in the 30th year of the Republic (1941), it sometimes lasted for as long as ten days or a week. That can be considered the longest period. In the 31st year of the Republic (1942), I left Chongqing and moved to Meitan County in eastern Guizhou Province to rest and recuperate, doing nothing, and I felt much better. When the condition flared up, it only took two or three days to recover. I returned to Shanghai in April of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), and it has been almost two and a half years since then. In the first year and a half, it still flared up about every thirty or forty days, but the duration was very short, and the severity of the condition was very mild. In the past year, the interval between flare-ups has gradually increased, and the severity has also become milder. From this, it can be understood that the examination in the 35th year of the Republic (1946) showed only 175 because it happened to be when the condition was not flaring up, while the examination in the 36th year of the Republic (1947) showed 190 because it was precisely when the old condition was flaring up. In the past year, I have been teaching at school, giving two lectures in a row without feeling tired at all. When writing articles, thinking and using my brain, I can continue for three or four hours without feeling particularly dizzy or mentally exhausted. As the ancients said, "Like a person drinking water, one knows whether it is cold or warm." This is my personal experience. Now I can confidently say that before returning to Shanghai, the gradual reduction in high blood pressure was due to rest. After returning to Shanghai, the gradual reduction in high blood pressure seems to be partly attributable to quiet sitting. This is the first effect. Also, I used to be prone to catching colds, often sneezing and having a runny nose unintentionally when exposed to cold air, followed by swelling and congestion of the nasal cavity, and even extending to the throat and trachea. However, in the past year and a half, this has not happened. Also, indigestion used to be a common occurrence, but it is no longer the case. This can be considered the second effect. Moreover, sometimes when I overwork my brain and feel tired, or have a slight discomfort in my head, I immediately go to practice quiet sitting. After sitting for an hour or fifty minutes, when I get up again, I feel exceptionally comfortable and completely return to normal. What is especially pleasing to me is that after practicing quiet sitting in the evening, as soon as my head hits the pillow, I fall soundly asleep without any dreams. This can also be considered the third effect.

These are roughly the types of experiences I have been able to have since I started practicing quiet sitting.
