### Annihilation Battle in Northern Wei and Eastern Gansu: Tracking Extends to 21 Counties Over Four Weeks

[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 13th] Between Northern Wei and Eastern Gansu, the National Army concluded this annihilation battle, lasting 28 days and tracking through 21 counties in two provinces, amidst victory reports. The Xi'an Pacification Headquarters held a symposium at noon on the 13th, convening leaders from all sectors and the press to report on the battle's process and its causes and consequences. General Hu Zongnan presided over the meeting. Senior staff officers stated: The communist bandits' invasion of Guanzhong involved four columns crossing the Jing River south of Yichuan, disrupting the northern bank of the Wei River and the western end of the Eastern Gansu Railway. Our four divisions pursued from the east, and the bandits fled into Gansu, where they were ambushed by the National Army moving south from Eastern Gansu, suffering heavy casualties along the way. The remnant bandits fled back towards northern Shaanxi in two groups via Ning County and Zhengning, retreating through irregular terrain. One route fled east through Zhuda Town, north of Yichuan, towards Malan, while the other route fled through Yichuan City into Zhaojin Town, northwest of Yaoxian. Our main force is currently pursuing and encircling them separately. The National Army that entered Gansu is now partially returning to Shaanxi Province to search for scattered bandits in the mountains of Linyou and remnants between Bin County and Yongshou, south of the Jing River.

The bandit troops' actions this time were mainly focused on the aforementioned area, but also involved invasions along four other routes in coordination: (1) An attempt to invade Pucheng from Baishui in the south, but it was consistently unsuccessful. (2) An attempt to invade Shaan County and 靈寳 from western Henan, but they have now been repelled. (3) An advance from southwestern Henan to attack Zijingguan and Xiping, attempting to invade Shangnan, but they were also repelled, and southeastern Shaanxi has remained peaceful. (4) An attempt to invade Ankang in southern Shaanxi via Baihe and Xunyang from northern Hubei, but after Xunyang was recently recovered, the bandits have retreated to Baihe. In summary, the bandit troops' five-pronged attack has been a complete failure.

The National Army was in an interior position this time. Due to correct strategy, maintaining the initiative, tactical mobility, rapid advances and retreats, and the strong morale of the troops, as well as cooperation between the military and the people, the brilliant results were achieved. It is estimated that the bandits suffered over 30,000 casualties, 8,000 were captured, and countless war materials were seized. The ratio of National Army casualties to bandit casualties was greater than one to five.

### Guan Linzheng Discusses Military Training Progress in Shaanxi

Denies Rumors He Will Preside Over Shaanxi Politics

[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 13th] Guan Linzheng told reporters on the morning of the 13th: The national (including Taiwan) military training work is continuing to improve compared to before. He denied rumors that he would soon preside over Shaanxi politics. He believes it is difficult for people from this province to work locally, and a rigid style is not suitable for Shaanxi Province. Moreover, cultivating national military cadres at military academies is more important than positions such as provincial chairman or executive officer. He believes the Northwest war situation has turned from danger to safety. The battle in Northern Wei and Eastern Gansu dealt a significant blow to Peng Dehuai's bandit troops, which is a major gain in the bandit suppression process. Guan will return to his hometown of Echeng County after completing official business, and then fly to Chengdu and Chongqing within days to inspect military training in Sichuan, Kang, Guizhou, and Yunnan. His inspection of national military training work will then be completed.

### KMT and Youth Party Leaders Discuss Legislative Yuan Seat Allotment; Legislators Rao Fenghuang and Others Urge Cooperation Between the Two Parties

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Kuomintang and the Youth Party are currently negotiating on the issue of Legislative Yuan seat allocation and party cooperation after the implementation of the constitution, and the issue of Legislative Yuan seat allocation will be resolved under the principle of party cooperation. Zhang Qun hosted a banquet at his residence at 8:00 PM on the 13th, inviting Yu Jiaju, Chen Qitian, and Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party, as well as Chen Bulei, Zhang Lisheng, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Chen Lifu, and Lei Zhen of the Kuomintang. The two matters were discussed and reviewed during the banquet, which ended at 10:00 PM. Subsequently, the three members of the Youth Party, Yu, Chen, and Zuo, immediately took the 11:00 PM night train to Shanghai to attend the party's Central Standing Committee meeting to be held in Shanghai on the 14th.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Former National Political Council, Legislative Yuan, and cultural figures, including legislators Rao Fenghuang, recently jointly sent a letter to Zhang Junli, Zeng Qi, and others, urging the legislators of the People's Socialist Party and the Youth Party to attend the first session of the Legislative Yuan. The letter's tone was sincere, first praising the spirit of the two parties in participating in the War of Resistance and the establishment of a joint government, and then expressing regret that the elected legislators of the two parties would not attend the Legislative Yuan due to the issue of seat allocation. The letter stated: "We believe that the political significance of the Legislative Yuan seat allocation issue outweighs its legal nature, and it should not be difficult to seek a solution through political means. Although you are a minority in the current Legislative Yuan, given that you have made significant contributions to the country as a minority in the National Political Council, how can the progress of democracy be limited in the constitutional era? If this affects cooperation among the three parties, it will not only be a cause for grief for relatives and joy for enemies, but all those who have shared the worries of the country and the nation during the War of Resistance will have endless regrets." The letter continued in a solemn tone: "The country is facing difficulties, and the world situation is becoming increasingly urgent. The need for national unity to overcome difficulties is even greater now than during the war. We have either worked together in the National Political Council and the previous Legislative Yuan for many years, or have had a long-standing spiritual connection through writing. We dare to express our sincere feelings, and hope that you will consider the overall situation and come forward. All issues can be discussed openly and honestly, and there should be no reason why they cannot be resolved." The letter was signed by Rao Fenghuang, Xia Douyin, Hu Qiuyuan, Liu Baimin, Qian Nashui, Cheng Shewo, Zhang Daofan, Huang Jianzhong, Liu Keshu, Yang Youjiong, Zhu Zifan, Hong Ruizhao, Wang Menglin, Deng Gongxuan, Hu Jianzhong, Zhang Daoxing, Ma Shuli, Yang Yuqing, Zhan Chunjian, Deng Feihuang, Luo Gonghua, Gan Jia　, Zai Baoquan, Fan Yusui, Huang Yuren, Chen Xun　, Wu Hexuan, and Qi Zhihou.

### Fierce Debate at Drafting Committee of Legislative Yuan Rules of Procedure; All 14 Chapters to be Discussed Further Today

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The Drafting Committee of the Legislative Yuan Rules of Procedure held meetings on the morning and afternoon of the 13th to discuss the first draft of the proposal drafted by the seven-member group consisting of Chen Guyuan, Chen Haicheng, Zheng Yanfen, Du Guangqi, Dai Xiujun, Tong Guanxian, and Zhang Jinjian. The first draft consists of 14 chapters, totaling 79 articles. The meeting was chaired by Convenor Lei Yin at 9:00 AM, where the report drafted by Chen et al. and the full text of the first draft were read. Chen and Dai gave simple summary explanations, and then began to discuss the chapters and articles one by one. The members carefully considered each sentence and word, and spoke enthusiastically and vigorously, with several exciting debates.

The first chapter, "General Principles," in addition to defining the basis of the rules and general meeting affairs, stipulates (1) When both the President and Vice President are unable to attend the meeting, the attending members shall mutually elect one person to be the chair. (2) The passage of a bill shall go through three readings, but it may also be omitted at times and put to a vote directly. (3) When each session is about to expire, the session may be extended if necessary after a resolution is passed.

The second chapter, "Proposals," the number of co-signers caused controversy. The original provisions of the first draft stipulated that, in addition to those stipulated by the Constitution and the Legislative Yuan Organization Law, proposals disagreeing with the Executive Yuan's important policies and requesting changes should have at least 50 co-signers, and other proposals should have at least 30 co-signers. Many members believed that corrective bills disagreeing with the Executive Yuan's important policies were not more important than legal bills, and that minority opinions should also be taken into account for other proposals.　Proposals on warfare, reconciliation, and amnesty would not necessarily be submitted efficiently, and their final establishment still depended on the resolution of the general assembly. The restrictions on proposals should not be so restrictive. As a result, the former number of 50 people was reduced to 30, and the latter number of 30 people was reduced to 10. Secondly, the number of endorsements for temporary proposals was also reduced from the original number in the first draft. As for the acceptance of petitions from the people in the first draft, it was originally stipulated that "petitions shall not be accepted unless introduced by at least 10 legislators, and shall not become a proposal unless reviewed." Chen Haicheng et al. said that this regulation was to avoid too many petitioners, which would be too troublesome. However, after Zhang Weizhen, Sun Gui　, Chen Guyuan, and others strongly argued that the Legislative Yuan, representing the people, should not lose its position and illegally restrict the full and sufficient right of petition granted to the people by the Constitution, the final amendment was "petitions from the people may become a proposal after review." The discussion of the second chapter was completed, and it was already 12:00 noon, so the meeting was adjourned temporarily. The meeting continued at 3:00 PM, with Convenor Li Boshen taking over as chairman.

The third chapter, "Agenda," was smoothly passed after minor textual modifications.

The fourth chapter, "Meeting," stipulates that meetings shall be held twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays, and the number of meetings may be increased if necessary. To extend the meeting time, the chairman must consult the attending members and obtain their consent.

In the fifth chapter, "Reading," some members worried that putting the entire bill to a vote at the third reading could fail to pass because the number of supporters could not exceed half of the number of attendees. Zhu Huiqing first raised questions, and Liu Butong and others expressed similar feelings. Although Chen Guyuan, Zheng Yanfen, and Zhang Jinjian explained based on facts and understanding, it could not be said that this kind of doubt was completely impossible, and it was difficult to find a remedy in law. The provision in Article 12 of the Legislative Yuan Organization Law, requiring a majority vote for passage, made this problem impossible to solve, so this matter was temporarily suspended.

In the sixth chapter, "Discussion," Liu Butong opposed limiting the speaking time. Wu Shangying, Du Guangxun, and others believed that the speaking rights of the majority should not be deprived in order to protect the speaking rights of a few individuals, and that the progress of the agenda should not be affected. The filibusters and delaying tactics allowed in the US Senate, with only 96 members, were not worthy of being used as a model in the large Legislative Yuan. As a result, Liu's opinion was rejected, and it was still stipulated that the explanation, questioning, or answering of a proposal should not exceed seven minutes, and the discussion should not exceed ten minutes, but could be extended with the chairman's permission.　In the seventh chapter, "Voting," in addition to some discussion on the regulations for revotes and counter-votes, the difficulties encountered in the fifth chapter were raised again, but it was still difficult to obtain a satisfactory solution. Bao Huaguo proposed that the final vote on a bill could be notified in advance, and Zheng Yanfen proposed that the final vote could be postponed to avoid too many abstentions or too few attendees. However, neither could guarantee that the number of supporters would definitely exceed half of the number of attendees and guarantee the passage of the third reading. After a long period of debate, there was still no result, so the opinions of the members were recorded.

Article 52 of the eighth chapter, "Exercise of the Power of Consent," "When exercising the power of consent under Article 55 of the Constitution, the Legislative Yuan may request the President to submit the policy opinions of the proposed person," aroused fierce and sharp debate. Qi Zhihou first proposed that when exercising the power of consent over the appointment of the President of the Executive Yuan, not only should the policy opinions be obtained first, but also the candidates for the heads of the various ministries and commissions that he will recruit should be known. Chen Guyuan, Dai Xiujun, Zheng Yanfen, and others believed that this claim had no basis in the Constitution. The Legislative Yuan only has the power to consent to the President of the Executive Yuan, and appointing the heads of the ministries and commissions is the power of the President. Ju Huaguo pointed out that Article 57 of the Constitution stipulates that the "Executive Yuan" is responsible to the Legislative Yuan, not just the "President of the Executive Yuan." The heads of the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan can be directly questioned by the Legislative Yuan, and Article 58 stipulates that the Executive Yuan must submit cases to the Legislative Yuan after being resolved by the Executive Yuan meeting. It can be seen that the President of the Executive Yuan, the heads of the various ministries and commissions, and the political commissioners are jointly responsible to the Legislative Yuan. If the Legislative Yuan does not know the candidates for the cabinet members at the same time before agreeing to the President of the Executive Yuan, then the President of the Executive Yuan can use this to shirk responsibility after taking office, and the policy opinions are just empty words. Peng Chunshi and Yang Yuqing also insisted that the President of the Executive Yuan's use of personnel is also part of the policy. Although the Legislative Yuan does not have to agree to each of his cabinet members one by one, it should at least allow the Legislative Yuan to understand first. Sun Guiji believed that at the beginning of the implementation of the Constitution, attention should be paid to political stability, and the power of consent should not be overly difficult. Wu Wangji said that the power of questioning can correct the President of the Executive Yuan's improper use of personnel. Bao Huaguo still emphasized the responsibility of the cabinet, Fei Xia also advocated that the Legislative Yuan should at least understand the standards for the President of the Executive Yuan's use of personnel, and Zhu Huiqing even called out that this power of consent is the most important power currently remaining in the Legislative Yuan and must be used well. It was still inconclusive until about 7:00 PM. The chairman then obtained the consent of the meeting and declared the meeting adjourned, and decided to hold another meeting in the afternoon of the 14th to continue the discussion.

### Eradicate Bureaucratic Style, Launch Full-Scale Bandit Suppression

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] Military News Agency report: The Pacification Zone Political Affairs Symposium continued to meet at 8:00 AM on the 13th. Zuo Shunsheng reported on the general situation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the focus of future work.

Those with money should contribute money, and those with strength should contribute strength. We will surely be able to suppress the communist bandits in a short period of time." He then instructed that alleviating the suffering of the people and the laws and plans promulgated by the government must be completed within a time limit. At 11:15 AM, after the chairman finished giving instructions, he took a group photo with all the participants. The symposium continued to be held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. Police Director Tang Zong spoke on the use of the people's self-defense forces, and at 7:00 PM, group discussions were conducted, which lasted until 9:00 PM.

Later, it drafted a draft of the Provincial, Municipal, and County Magistrate Election and Recall Law based on the Constitution, intending to submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval after the Provincial and County Autonomy Selection Regulations are promulgated.

### Supervisory Yuan to Convene at the Beginning of Next Month; Preparation Committee Members to be Announced Soon

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 13th] The powers entrusted to the Supervisory Yuan by the Constitution include the power to consent to the appointment of the presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuans. Therefore, at the beginning of the implementation of the Constitution, the five Yuans, produced in accordance with the Constitution, will advance in an orderly manner. The Judicial and Examination Yuans must wait until the Supervisory Yuan is established before the President can nominate them in accordance with the law and be produced with the consent of the Supervisory Yuan. It is learned that our first President will be inaugurated on the 20th, and the convocation order may be issued within two or three days after the inauguration. Therefore, the convocation of the Supervisory Yuan should be based on June 1st. It is also learned that the total number of Supervisory Committee members is 223. Currently, except for the six provinces and two municipalities in the Northeast that have not been elected due to the bandit disturbances, more than 160 people have been elected and should be able to convene as scheduled. Liu Zhe, the director of the Preparation Office, and 27 members will be announced by the National Government. The future site of the Supervisory Yuan has been decided to be the original site of the Legislative Yuan. The reporter interviewed Director Liu Zhe today to ask about the preparation work. He said: The preparation work of the Supervisory Yuan is relatively simple because the number of members is less than the number of legislators and even less than the number of National Assembly representatives. The entertainment aspect will also be streamlined as much as possible. It has been internally decided that the Secretary-General of the Preparation Office will be Mr. Li Chongbao. As for the candidates for President and Vice President, Liu believes that this is the right of all Supervisory Committee members, and everyone has the right to elect and be elected. Therefore, it is impossible to predict in advance. However, regarding the expectations of President Jiang and all parties for Yu Youren to serve as President, the possibility cannot be judged at this time. As for Mr. Yu's resignation from the right to be elected as a Supervisory Committee member, this is only a concession to the local election office, and it is feared that the Central Government has not expressed its consent to this, so Mr. Yu still has the right to be elected. The first meeting of the Supervisory Yuan will be similar to the meeting of the Legislative Yuan, with a preparatory meeting held to elect the President before the official meeting.

[Our Chongqing Thirteenth Dispatch] Dr. Peng Guangqin, Director of the Chongqing Industrial Experiment Institute of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, visited Li Zhiyu, Director of the Health Bureau, today. He expressed his eagerness to participate in the research on Yang Mei's physiological aspects. The medical colleges of Guangxi and Huaxi Universities have equipment for measuring the metabolic base, which can be borrowed for examination. Li agreed to form an organization to discuss the matter in detail after the initial results are announced on June 1st. Li also stated that Yang Mei has been tested for four days, and she still has not eaten or had a bowel movement, and her sleep is excellent. Everything is normal. It is a fact that she is not eating, but the reason and truth behind it still need to be studied after the end of the test. This move has a significant impact on the medical community. He specifically sent a letter to Dr. Jia Qizhendao, Dean of the Medical College of Huaxi University in Chengdu, asking for cooperation in the next step. Also, Yang Mei is indeed staying in the Citizen's Hospital.

The Significance of the Highland Aboriginal Culture Exhibition in Taiwan

Liu Xian

It has been almost three years since Taiwan returned to the embrace of the motherland. The people of the country have gradually gained more knowledge of the general situation in Taiwan. However, there is very little understanding of the Highland Aborigines of Taiwan. The Highland Aborigines are the original inhabitants of Taiwan. In the past, they were widely distributed, except for the western part of the island. The northeast, southeast, and Penghu were all places where they gathered. They have a population of about 200,000, divided into seven major tribes: the Tayal tribe, the Saisiyat tribe, the Bunun tribe, the Tsou tribe, the Paiwan tribe, the Amis tribe, and the Yami tribe. They have simple customs, deep superstitions, and primitive customs. They are an excellent subject for studying early human societies and frontier ethnic groups. Unfortunately, except for anthropologists and a few concerned people, little attention is paid to them. Scholars cannot help but regret this!

Now, under the organization of Dr. Ding Huikang and the preparation of Professor Jin Tong, a "Taiwan Highland Aboriginal Customs and Art Exhibition" is being held at the French Association on Nanchang Road from May 5th to May 15th (Editor's note: Since May 12th, it has been moved to the National Goods Company for exhibition). Nearly a thousand pieces of Highland Aboriginal folk specimens are gathered (some of which were borrowed and displayed by the Specimen Room of the Anthropology Department of National Jinan University). These include various daily utensils for food, clothing, housing, and transportation, artistic works of decoration, sculpture, embroidery, as well as weapons, musical instruments, worship items, and beliefs. More than two hundred on-site photos are taken to show the various life situations of the Highland Aborigines from various angles. Everything from material enjoyment, spiritual entertainment, men, women, old and young, and various activities is quite detailed. Visitors look at the pictures and recognize the objects, almost as if they are in the Highland Aborigines, which is of profound significance and commendable.

As someone who specializes in anthropology, I am particularly interested in this exhibition. After viewing it, I have a lot of feelings. I would like to express my opinions to discuss this matter.

First, this exhibition has a fairly rich collection and many types, almost everything. It is a great view of the ethnic art objects of the Highland Aborigines. To engage in collecting with private forces not only takes time and effort but also requires a large amount of money. Furthermore, it is only those who have a considerable understanding of early ethnic art objects and are deeply interested in them can accomplish this. We deeply admire the enthusiasm and perseverance of Dr. Ding and Professor Jin!

Second, the significance of this exhibition lies more in introducing the culture of the Highland Aborigines than in evaluating their artistic works. From the perspective of material culture, every early human artifact, whether it is a work of art or a daily utensil, is a point of cultural factors, which can be used for research. It is not like the ancient objects unearthed from the Shang and Zhou Dynasties, which can be used for the evaluation of antiques. Therefore, in our view, a finely carved idol and a roughly made rattanware or earthenware pot have the same value. They all represent a point of culture. By integrating all the various cultural factors of a primitive nation, one can see the whole picture of its culture. Although the artifacts exhibited may not be enough to fully show the material culture of the Highland Aborigines, they are more than half of what is needed.

Third, with convenient transportation and frequent ethnic contact, the world's primitive ethnic groups, no matter how remote, can no longer live a life of utopia. Once a low-level culture comes into contact with a high-level culture, the former is often eliminated and cannot be preserved. Therefore, the original artifacts of early human societies are no longer produced due to lack of need, and they are decreasing day by day, until they disappear and are lost forever. The current situation of the Highland Aborigines is also the same, and there is no exception. Therefore, any genuine original creations of the Highland Aborigines are valuable and should be collected for verification. Moreover, this type of artifacts that represent cultural fragments are easy to scatter and difficult to gather. For the sake of studying early human culture and preserving cultural relics for the country, an anthropological research institute or a folk museum should be established to engage in more perfect collection. If a permanent institution can be formed from this exhibition, as is done in various advanced countries in Europe and the United States, it will not only make great contributions to human science and cultural history in the future, but it will also preserve the things of the borderlands so that the people of the country can view them, exchange culture, and know themselves and their enemies. It also has great educational significance. It is heard that the organizer has always been a grand vision for promoting culture, with a family tradition and rich resources. It is hoped that a permanent institution can be established in time to advocate for the people of the country.

In short, this Highland Aboriginal folk exhibition is a relatively large-scale one since Taiwan rejoined the territory of the motherland. It makes the people of the country aware of the border ethnic groups, and the objects displayed have great educational value. Hearing is not as good as seeing, so that the students can see it and get a deep impression. Therefore, it promotes cultural exchange and increases ethnic feelings. Its significance lies elsewhere. The opportunity is rare. Those who care about ethnicity, culture, borderlands, and education, I hope you don't miss it. The picture on the right is a Highland Aboriginal man with a tattooed face.

British Rule Ends Tonight at Midnight - Situation in Palestine Suddenly Tense - Truman and Marshall Decide to Request UN to Establish Conciliation Commissioner - Arabs and Jews Prepare to Fight and Launch a Battle for Control

[Reuters Jerusalem Thirteenth Dispatch] The sound of flutes echoing from the Government House of Palestine on Friday midnight will mark the end of thirty years of British rule in Palestine. The mandate is scheduled to officially end on Friday midnight, and British forces will begin their withdrawal on Friday. High Commissioner Cunningham will depart Palestine from Haifa aboard the British cruiser "Euryalus" shortly after midnight on Friday. The mandate ending ceremony will be held on Friday evening in Haifa. The last batch of British troops in Jaffa sailed to Haifa on Friday night, and the last batch of British police arrived in Haifa on Saturday morning.

[United Press Haifa Thirteenth Dispatch] On the morning of the thirteenth, the British handed over the Haifa seaside airport to the Jews.

[Reuters Jerusalem Thirteenth Dispatch] With the British handover of the mandate over Palestine less than twenty-four hours away, the entire Middle East feels a tragedy about to unfold. The Arab and Jewish communities are awaiting a series of new developments that will lead this storm-ravaged holy land into a new era. Neighboring Egypt, which entered a state of full combat readiness at midnight on the twelfth, Jews and Arabs within the holy land are still staging a struggle for the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway. Thousands of Arab reinforcements, after concentrating in the El-Arud area, fourteen miles west of Jerusalem, overnight, launched a fierce counterattack on the already dominant Jewish military positions at dawn on the thirteenth. In the abnormally silent city of Jerusalem, Jewish civilians are actively carrying out their plan to infiltrate various areas of the holy land. The Arabs, at least on the surface, are not prepared to cope. The mandate has been announced by the Palestinian government to formally end at midnight on the fourteenth, and the British military and police in the Jerusalem area will begin to withdraw to Haifa from the fourteenth. The Jewish headquarters in Tel Aviv has broadcast a general mobilization order, ordering retired soldiers currently exempt from military service throughout Palestine to immediately report to local headquarters. Although the end of the mandate is only a little over twenty-four hours away, the United Nations General Assembly in New York has only heard of slow progress. The plenary session convened specifically to discuss the Palestine issue is scheduled to end its weeks-long mission on the thirteenth, the only result being the appointment of a holy land conciliation committee. The partition plan has been shelved, and the trusteeship proposal has not been heard. It was previously hoped that the United Nations agency would establish several transitional United Nations authorities in the holy land, but this hope has vanished after the Jewish and Arab representatives declared their rejection of this proposal last night. In Washington, President Truman convened Secretary of State Marshall to the White House to discuss the Palestine issue. After the meeting, it was announced that the United States would propose to the United Nations on the thirteenth that the UN General Assembly appoint a High Commissioner for Palestine. Selected by the five powers, its task is only to mediate. At the same time, the United States also proposed abolishing the Palestine Committee. It is also rumored in Washington that Marshall has sent a secret telegram to David Ben-Gurion, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency, but the contents are not known to the outside world. Within the Egyptian territory bordering Palestine, 10,000 Egyptian troops have been concentrated in the area to prevent a Jewish attack. Arab Palestine, within the holy land, Beisen, an Arab city fifteen miles southeast of Haifa, has been captured by Jewish forces. It is rumored that the Arabs of Jaffa have surrendered, but the Haganah forces have not yet entered. Fierce fighting broke out again at dawn today in the Etzion area, five miles south of Jerusalem in southern Palestine.

The Soviet Union will recognize the Jewish state on the sixteenth after its establishment - American senators will urge Congress to take the same steps

[United Press Washington Thirteenth Dispatch] Congressional sources said on the thirteenth that the Soviet Union may immediately recognize the new Jewish state of Palestine after its establishment on the sixteenth, so that communist forces can extend to the Middle East. Some members of the House of Representatives believe that the Soviet Union will quickly recognize the Jewish state, and then it can send well-trained consular economic and military personnel to the area to form part of the Soviet diplomatic corps and form a wedge for the spread of communism in the Middle East. This group of senators believes that this development will force Congress to pressure the State Department to take the same steps. When the House Foreign Affairs Committee meets on May 25, it will hear opinions in favor of Congress legislating to immediately recognize the Jewish state and quickly lift the arms embargo. However, some people still fear that the Soviet Union will preemptively recognize the Jewish state before the 25th. A member of the Foreign Affairs Committee said that the Soviet Union's rapid recognition will result in Congress quickly legislating, unless the State Department immediately follows the Soviet Union in recognizing the Jewish state. He said: "If the Soviet Union does this - many experts believe that this move is imminent - the United States, in order to protect its interests in the Middle East, will have to do the same."

[Reuters Jerusalem Twelfth Dispatch] Well-informed sources said that the Jewish state of Palestine has decided to announce its establishment on Sunday, the sixteenth. The provisional government of the Jewish state will be modeled on the French Republic system, with a president and a cabinet of twelve people, including foreign affairs, national defense, internal affairs, economy and finance, immigration, industry and commerce, labor, agriculture, fisheries, public works and transportation, justice, education, health, and social welfare departments. The capital is located in Tel Aviv, and the central government agencies will be built in Shalona, the former German immigrant area northeast of Tel Aviv. The Provisional Government Committee or Parliament will also be located in Tel Aviv. Most of the central government officials are heads of the Jewish Agency.

Whether US-Soviet Relations Can Be Improved Depends on the Attitude of the Soviet Union - Truman Firmly Supports Marshall's View

[Our Report] New York Thirteenth Broadcast: President Truman once again expressed his views on the recent US-Soviet relations issue at today's press conference. He said that his hope for world peace has not increased due to the exchange of letters between the US and the Soviet Union. Whether US-Soviet relations can be improved depends on whether there is a fundamental change in Soviet foreign policy. Truman believes that Marshall has stated everything about the improvement of US-Soviet relations yesterday. He fully supports Marshall's views. What is needed now is concrete action, not empty words. If the Soviet Union is willing to promote peace, it can be achieved through the United Nations or other diplomatic channels, he said.

President Truman said that he does not expect to meet with Stalin. Even if Stalin is willing to visit Washington, he has no intention of discussing matters with Stalin.

[United Press Washington Thirteenth Dispatch] Secretary of State Marshall declared yesterday that unless the Soviet Union takes clear action or proposes to resolve the differences between the US and the Soviet Union, the United States will continue to promote the "Cold War." President Truman gave strong support to Marshall's statement today. Some people originally thought that the exchange of letters between the US and the Soviet Union could promote a peace conference between the two countries, but Marshal stressed that the United States will use existing institutions such as the United Nations and Allied Management Committees to resolve international issues, which has dispelled the above hopes. Diplomatic circles interpreted Marshall's statement as saying that this move indicates that it is impossible for Truman and Stalin to discuss global issues. It is known here that the Soviet Union believes that Smith's letter is a suggestion to hold talks, but its original intention was only to state that the recent remarks of American personnel are different from the official policy of the United States. Government officials are paying more and more attention to the current "war talks" in the United States and want to tell the Kremlin that the US government does not approve of this attitude. Authoritative sources said that Marshal and the State Department believe that the stage of international relations is now relatively quiet and think of using Smith's memorandum to point out the unreliability of inflammatory rhetoric.

The optimistic atmosphere was strong after today's six-nation conference adjourned, which was very different from the situation after previous conferences. Significant progress has almost been made in the meeting. The meeting will continue tomorrow and then be extended to early next week.

Marshall Asks the Soviet Union to Cooperate - To Break the Korean Crisis of Division - Li Seung-man Has Won Sixty-one Seats in the South Korean General Election

[Central News Agency Washington Twelfth Joint Dispatch] Marshall recently called on the Soviet Union to cooperate with the United Nations at a press conference to break the crisis of division that has plagued Korea. He said that action is urgently needed to reunify the western part of Korea. If the Soviet Union really wants to show their desire to seek solutions to various world problems, as they claim, then one of the best ways they can start is to withdraw their refusal to participate in the United Nations mission to Korea.

[US Information Office, Shengdun, Twelfth Dispatch] Secretary of State Marshall congratulated the Korean people on the successful completion of Korea's first free election on May 10 at a press conference today. The Secretary of State issued the following statement: "Korea's first democratic election was successfully completed on Monday under the supervision of the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea, which should be congratulated to the Korean people." "Approximately ninety percent of registered voters were unwilling to obstruct or sabotage the illegal means of the Communist minority, and resolutely went to vote, which shows the Korean people's determination to form their own government through democratic means."

[United Press Agency, Seoul Thirteenth Dispatch] In South Korea, the votes in 182 of the 200 constituencies have been fully counted today. The Li Seung-man faction has won 61 of the 200 seats in the parliament. Among them, Li Seung-man's Korean Independence Promotion Association won 50 seats, and the Great Unity Youth Party won 11 seats. Kim Seong-su's Korean Democratic Party has won 27 seats, other parties have won 12 seats, and non-party members have been elected to 82 seats. There are 18 seats that have not yet been elected.

Korean Committee Will Come to Shanghai to Draft a Report on the General Election - No Consideration Will Be Given to MacArthur Changing His Attitude

[United Press Agency, Tokyo Thirteenth Dispatch] The United Nations Commission on Korea originally planned to draft a report on the South Korean general election in Tokyo, and a temporary office was established in Tokyo, but was tactfully rejected by MacArthur last week. MacArthur suddenly changed his attitude on the thirteenth and agreed to assist.

[United Press Agency, Seoul Thirteenth Dispatch] The chairman of the United Nations Commission on Korea, Mo Hir, said on the thirteenth that the committee currently does not intend to consider going to Tokyo to draft a report on the South Korean general election. "The committee is currently only paying attention to MacArthur's final decision, but will go to another country other than Japan and Korea to draft the report. We made this decision last night, and MacArthur's new statement cannot be changed."

[Agence France-Presse, Seoul Twelfth Dispatch] The United Nations Commission on Korea has decided to go to Shanghai to draft a report on the Korean election because "it is not easy to find a house in Japan." The exact date of departure has not yet been determined.

First, President Ai North formally swore in as the current President in Congress. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gronki, asked "Whether to swear allegiance to the Republic and faithfully abide by its constitution." Ai North immediately answered yes. After Ai North took the oath, he delivered an inaugural declaration, expressing respect for the achievements of the temporary President Nicola, and then signed an order appointing Nicola as a Senator for life. After the ceremony, Ai North took a car to the Quirinale Palace under the protection of military police, and the people cheered along the way.

[United Press Agency, Washington Twelfth Dispatch] The Secretary of State will be summoned by the Senate Committee on the thirteenth to comprehensively review the United States' foreign policy.

Soviet Union Attempts to Invade the Near East - The Most Threatened are Turkey and Iran - The Railway from the Caspian Sea to the Aral Sea is Being Built

[Reuters Washington Twelfth Dispatch] After studying the strategy of world communism, the House Foreign Affairs Committee issued a report today, believing that Soviet foreign policy is trying to create excuses for the Soviet army to enter the Near East. The real danger in the Near East lies in the proximity of the Soviet Union's position to the area, and the most threatened are Turkey and Iran.

The current foreign policy of the Soviet Union is to use any opportunity proposed by others, such as the Palestinian crisis, or use the threat of a third country as an excuse, to allow its troops to move into the Near East. The Kremlin may even invade the Near East without any excuse when it deems it appropriate.

[United Press Agency, Moscow Thirteenth Dispatch] The Soviet Union is building a new railway line, linking the Caspian Sea Railway and the Aral Sea, with a total length of 325 miles, to accelerate the transportation of cotton from the Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan production areas.

Two Fierce Men's Volleyball Matches: Victory Belongs to Guangzhou and Hong Kong. Guangzhou Gets Stronger and Stronger, Exploiting Enemy Weaknesses. Hong Kong Remains Calm, Veteran Confident.

[Our Report] Yesterday morning, the men's volleyball round-robin matches between Guangzhou and the Police, and Hong Kong and Shanghai, took place at the city sports field. Guangzhou defeated the Police 3-1, while Hong Kong achieved a complete victory of 3-0. The Shanghai team suffered another complete defeat in the round-robin.

Guangzhou: Pan Jinhong, Zhao Lianwu, Zhao Chenghuang
Li Lianze, Mei Yiquan, Chen Yingkuan
Zhou Hao, Mei Songfu, Li Xinglin

Police: Chan Ruijian, Ni Peilin
Junle
Wu Xianchan, Wu Quanzhuo, Chen Xianghua
Huang Yongdong, Huang Yumin, Li Rujiu

The players of the Guangzhou and Police teams mostly came from Yuet Taisan Middle School in Guangdong. Their tactics were quite similar, with both teams favoring attack over defense. However, Guangzhou was stronger and more experienced. The Police team, on the other hand, often failed to retaliate after their attacks were blocked and the ball returned to their side, resulting in lost points.

However, in the first set of yesterday's match, the Police team scored many points with their "attacking balls," gaining an advantage. Although Guangzhou quickly caught up to tie at eight points, their front-row blocking was not ideal, causing the ball to often slip into the corners of the third row, resulting in many lost points. The Police team's first left-wing and center blocker applied quick pressure with the ball, their movements extremely swift, often lightly tapping the ball into the opponent's gaps. Guangzhou's front row could not accurately block, and the second and third rows were naturally powerless. At the same time, although Guangzhou's front row frequently used feints to cover their attacks at the end of the first set, their movements were too slow and often seen through by the Police. These were the reasons for Guangzhou's loss in the first set.

Guangzhou's Great Victory: By the second set, Guangzhou had observed the enemy's strategy and retaliated in kind. Their front-row left wing and second-row right guard also used quick spikes and pressure techniques, scoring many points. When it was their turn to serve, they served fiercely, targeting the Police's weaknesses. At this time, although the Police responded with fierce spikes and pressure, many missed their target. The Police's morale slightly wavered, and the second and third defensive lines made continuous mistakes, allowing Guangzhou to win the second set by a large margin of 21-10.

In the third set, Guangzhou's Li Lianze scored with a powerful kill, and the Police immediately returned the favor, making the game very intense. At the same time, the Police scored with a successful serve, soon taking a 5-3 lead. However, the Police again started strong but faded, and the good times did not last. Guangzhou followed with several fierce spikes, and the Police's third-row left guard constantly lost ground. Fortunately, the Police's front-row killer, skilled in lightly tapping the ball, performed another miracle, regaining a 10-6 advantage.

Unexpectedly, from then on, Guangzhou unleashed great ferocity, and the Police's blocking failed, with the ball landing freely in the third row. After the score reached 13 (Police) to 17 (Guangzhou), Lu Lv served and won three points, proving the weakness of the Police's back-row defense, and Guangzhou finally won the third set.

In the final set, the battle was the fiercest. The Police's front-row left and right players frequently scored, and when the score reached 5-5 and 8-8, the two teams fought for each ball for a long time. However, from then on, it belonged to the Guangdong army. Guangzhou Lu battled to win the fifth set.

Hong Kong's Hard Fight: While the Guangzhou and Police teams were closely matched, Hong Kong and Shanghai opened their battle. This battle was difficult to assume as a champion (Hong Kong) versus third-place (Shanghai) match, but the Shanghai team in this match had improved significantly compared to their previous match against the Police, and their performance was more energetic than the Police-Guangzhou match.

Hong Kong: Lin Runming, Chen Shude, Zhao Shirun
Chen Changyong, Wang Yaomin, Zhong Shiyuan
Ouyang Zhaotang, Yu Qien, Li Liming

Shanghai: Wang Junbing, Wei Dingyi, Peng Quan
Qian Jiaxiang, Cheng Shining, Huang Yaohua Kongxiang, Weng Chengguang Chen Enrong
(In the third set, Huang Hua and Chen Enrong were switched)

In terms of tactical performance, Shanghai actually showed improvement yesterday, while Hong Kong was not as brilliant as in the battle against Guangzhou. Shanghai's lineup yesterday was more suitable than before, allowing them to showcase their balanced offense of both hard and soft techniques, which made Hong Kong, who are steady and good at overcoming the strong, appear slightly inferior. Therefore, Shanghai almost won in the third set.

In the first round, Shanghai's net blocking was good, and the three players in the front row mostly used light taps instead of fierce spikes. Although Hong Kong scored points, they still felt strained. Yu Qien's spikes often failed. When the score reached 14-17, a fierce ball flew into Hong Kong's third row, and Zhong Shiyuan dived to receive it, barely escaping danger. Before the veteran Zhong could get up, the ball was killed into the side of the third row by Shanghai. This Shanghai performance was excellent, but it aroused Yu Qien's fierceness, and he continuously attacked the gaps in Shanghai's defense, leading to Shanghai losing the first set by a score of 16-21.

Tense Situation: The second set battle began, and Hong Kong scored first due to a mistake by Shanghai's Chen Enrong. Shanghai's first and second rows and left and right guards attacked fiercely, once taking an 8-3 lead, but Hong Kong quickly caught up. The two sides held their ground, and Yu Qien's spikes were often blocked. When the score reached 18 (Shanghai) to 19 (Hong Kong), the performance was extremely thrilling. Afterwards, Hong Kong served into Shanghai's third-row corner, and Hong Kong won the second set 21-18.

In the final set, the attacks became even more intense. The Shanghai team was eager to win, putting on a great performance that was refreshing. Yu Qien's fierce spikes were all blocked. After tying at 15 points, Shanghai had hopes of winning a set. The score reached 19-19, and the two sides held their ground for half a minute before the ball landed. Then it was 20-20. Hong Kong calmly responded, not panicking at all, and after a long exchange, Hong Kong directed two balls towards Shanghai's third row and scored, winning the set 22-20 and achieving a complete victory.

Four Teams' Scores: As of yesterday, the results of the men's volleyball round-robin were as follows:

Team Name Win Loss Score
Hong Kong 2 0 4
Guangzhou 1 0 2
Police 1 1 2
Shanghai 0 2 0

Table Tennis Tournament Concludes: Wang Youxin Wins Men's Championship. Women's Second, Third, and Fourth Place Winners Also Announced.

[Our Report] The men's and women's table tennis tournaments continued yesterday at the General Assembly Gymnasium, with two men's round-robin matches, one women's final rematch, and four men's and women's qualifying matches. The men's champion of the championship was Wang Youxin from Taiwan, and the women's champion was Liang Yujie from Hong Kong (incorrectly registered as Liang Yujie). Wang Hanbao (Songjiang) and Qiu Baoyun (Taiwan) won the men's and women's qualifying championships, respectively. The women's second-place final was temporarily changed to yesterday, with Liu Yunv losing to Sun Ying, finishing in third place. The competition schedule was completely finished and concluded successfully.

Xue Xuchu Wins Effortlessly; Wang Youxin Narrowly Escapes Defeat: In the men's championship, Hong Kong's Zhong Zhancheng faced Shanghai's Xue Xuchu yesterday. Xue's ball striking showed the demeanor of a master, and Zhong struggled to keep up. Xue Xuchu easily won the first two sets 11-3 and 11-5. Although the last set was closer, Zhong was still no match for Xue, losing the third set 11-7. Zhong lost all three matches, finishing fourth. Xue won two of three matches, scoring four points and finishing second.

You Ruheng (Malaysia) posed a great threat to Wang Youxin (Taiwan) for the championship. When they met yesterday, Yu Lian fired difficult balls, winning the first set 11-0. In the second set, You Ruheng continued to rely on his tricky and fast-spinning balls to win. Wang Youxin, seeing himself lose two sets in a row, became furious and went all out, finally winning the third set 13-11. After that, Wang frequently used his signature long-range shots, while You only had scoring opportunities when serving. Wang won the fourth set 11-5. In the final set, the score was tied several times. Wang proceeded cautiously and won the fifth set 11-8. With this, Wang won three of three matches and ascended the throne.

Name Win Loss Points
Wang Youqian (Taiwan) 3 0 6
Xue Xuchu (Shanghai) 2 1 4
You Ruheng (Malaysia) 1 2 2

Sun Meiying Has a Stroke of Luck; Liu Yunv Loses the Match: The highlight was the women's second-place rematch. Yang Wei, due to a conflict with the tennis competition schedule, automatically withdrew, leaving only Sun Meiying (Shanghai) and Liu Yunv (Taiwan) to compete. Sun, known as a "lucky general" by Zhou, won the first set 11-8. Sun Meiying also won the second set 11-9. Because Sun won two sets in a row, she became psychologically nervous. Liu then adopted an offensive strategy and won the third set 11-8. In the fourth set, Sun Meiying, after being cheered on, was more calm and had several excellent performances. With the crowd cheering her on, Sun became more confident and defeated Liu Yunv 11-1, winning the women's second place. Liu finished third, and Yang Weibin finished fourth.

The scores of the women's table tennis championship are listed below:

Name Win Loss Points
Liang Wangjie (Hong Kong) 3 0 6

Wang Canhua Has Never Considered Marriage, Only Wants to Specialize in Sports in Shanghai. Our Reporter: Hong Xucai

[Our Special Report] Six days ago, Beijing athlete Wang Canhua broke the national shot put record, causing a sensation. Two days later, the shot put champion quietly lay in bed due to illness.

Speaking of Miss Wang, one immediately thinks of her large, round face, eyebrow-length short hair, sturdy figure, and Northern accent with a Shandong flavor. She studies at the Beijing Sports College and practices shot put every morning and evening. Last year, she strained her back due to overexertion. Although it healed, she felt pain every time she exerted herself. During the shot put final of this National Games, Miss Wang put all her effort into one throw, and her back pain recurred. The unbearable pain forced her to go to the hospital for treatment and rest temporarily.

Yesterday morning, the reporter made a special trip to the Municipal Fourth Hospital to comfort this warrior injured in battle.

Miss Wang is an athlete among women. She is twenty-one years old and has never thought about marriage. She said, "I treat male classmates as brothers and female classmates as sisters. Marriage? It's too much of a sacrifice for women. I've never considered it."

Her ambition is in aviation. She hopes to become a pilot, but she also said, "If I have to, I'll just be a sports teacher."

Sports and Wang Canhua have forged an unbreakable bond. She will not be like ordinary girls who see marriage as their destination. She believes that everyone, male or female, should have their own career. Living under someone else's roof is shameful and painful.

She broke the national shot put record with 10.97 meters, but she is not satisfied with this result. Her previous best performance was over 11 meters in shot put and 33 meters in discus.

Wang Canhua has an ambition to be selected by the National Sports Advancement Association. Then she would be willing to stay in Shanghai, practice hard, and participate in the World Games to be held in London this July.

Mayor Wu Stipulates That the Door-to-Door Selling Price of Rice Shops Must Not Exceed 5.8 Million. The People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee Sells 14,000 Shi Yesterday.

Mayor Wu summoned representatives of rice shops, Qu Zhenhua, Zhang Xichao, and Hu Hangang, at 8:30 PM yesterday to discuss and stipulate the door-to-door selling price of rice. Ren Xianqun, the chairman of the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee, and Ji Mingqi, the chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, were also present. After discussion, the Mayor decided that from yesterday (the 13th), the door-to-door selling price of all rice shops must not exceed 5.8 million yuan. Those who violate this will be severely punished.

With the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee continuing to sell rice, the market transaction was very sparse. The price remained at the previous day's level because the production area price was still firm and expensive. However, Bai Yuan and Yin Yuan, because there was no selling of them, had different sales channels, so the price increase was relatively large. The People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee simultaneously sold Bai Geng in the North and South Markets yesterday, with a price of 5.5 million yuan each. A total of 9,730 shi were sold in the South Market, and 3,660 shi were sold in the North Market, totaling 13,390 shi. The market registration for arrivals was 1,779 shi in the North Market and 11,961 shi in the South Market, including the sold rice.

Wheat Flour: Although the initial opening price was the same as the original market price, it already showed signs of weakness. Then, retail investors took advantage of the high price to sell, but wholesalers did not inquire, so the price fell. Lao Che and Bing Chuan flour retreated to 2.2 million yuan. Before closing, the China Trust Bureau and various flour mills jointly sold various brands of flour at a price of 2.1 million yuan delivered, and the market fell again. Lao Che and Bing Chuan flour closed at 2.12 million yuan, while Hong Feng and Jian Cheng fell to 2.11 million yuan. All fell by 180,000 to 190,000 yuan. A total of 2,480 bags of flour were sold. Bran fell by 80,000 yuan, and the wheat factory's price fell by 150,000 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains: Most of them rose, especially those purchased by the Qingdao gang, with strong momentum. Soybeans rose by 100,000 yuan, with the high price of Zha Beans at 3.4 million yuan. Corn, Red Sorghum, and Tea Beans all rose under the purchase of the Qingdao gang. Corn rose sharply by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan, Red Sorghum rose by 200,000 yuan, and the price of Middle-class Tea Beans rose by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. There were no more transactions of Selected Qing Beans. Red Beans were purchased by the Guangdong gang, and the price of Sand Red Beans rose to 8 million yuan. Sesame seeds had many repurchases the previous day, falling by 300,000 to 500,000 yuan. Raw peanuts rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.

Edible Oil: It was firm at first and then flat. In the morning, because the off-site price in the afternoon of the previous day had been high, the owners still wanted to raise the price. In addition, the price of soybeans was high, and the oil factory's opening price was also high. The initial opening price of soybean oil was 14.5 million yuan, but then there were many repurchases, and the price fell. The final prices were 14.2 million yuan and 13.9 million yuan, slightly higher than the previous day by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil also returned to flat later, with no difference between raw oil and the previous day. Small car sesame oil rose by 200,000 yuan. Soybean cake was firm at first and then returned, with almost no change in the end.

Special Telecommunications Supplement: Yu Dongjian on the Impact of the Telephone Time-Saving Campaign. Zhang Binhui

The telephone occupies a very important position in today's public utilities. The prosperity of a city can be measured by the need for telephones. The market is busy, and the application of telephones is also urgent. The development of business relies on the circulation of information, which depends on a telephone that can be used freely as a medium.

Due to the inability of international telephone equipment to be supplied normally after the war, there is a shortage of machines and lines, resulting in a situation where the supply of telephones cannot meet the demand. Users sometimes find it very difficult to get through on a telephone. To remedy this shortcoming, the active approach is to add telephone machine capacity, but this is difficult to achieve due to current financial and material constraints. The passive approach is for users to save time themselves and deepen their understanding of telephone use.

Normally, when we make a phone call, after dialing the first number, the first selector is activated, which in turn activates the first selector group machine. Dialing the second and third numbers activates the second and third selector groups, respectively, and dialing the fourth and fifth numbers activates the switchboard to connect the call. Because the number of keys and the amount of user needs are different, the number that can be connected at the same time is limited. According to theory and experience, automatic telephones may have 200 users calling out of every 2,000 users at the same time. Unless there is a special reason, this is absolutely sufficient in large cities, and small towns do not need this number. However, the current situation is that some users often talk for too long, occupying various keys, so that the other 1,800 users in every 2,000 users cannot dial out, and must wait for the users on the phone to stop before they can connect. This kind of line occupation situation lasts too long, which will affect the calling opportunities of other users, and at the same time, it is also very easy to cause damage to the keys. Occupying the line for too long and damaging the parts directly harms oneself, and indirectly affects most people!

Therefore, the Telecommunications Bureau has recently launched a campaign, namely the "Telephone Time-Saving Campaign". The meaning of this campaign is to remedy the above-mentioned drawbacks, so that everyone can enjoy the call time equally, save their own time, and understand other people's urgent needs. According to statistics, the average call time for domestic telephones is more than three minutes, while in foreign countries, it is only about two minutes. Also, on the same circuit, foreign countries can connect 40 to 50 calls per hour, while domestic ones can only connect 20 to 30 calls. This is nothing more than users occupying the line for

Editorial

### Reasonable Regulation of Public Utilities!

The price increases in public utilities, which follow the "May Price Hikes," are fiercely impacting the Shanghai market. Water, electricity, gas, and telephone services began their "new prices" on the 8th of this month; the "new prices" for public buses, trams, ferries, and small trains also began on the 12th of this month. It is rumored that the two railway bureaus will request a 50% price increase. Although this has not been confirmed, the general trend will likely follow suit. This time, the price increases in Shanghai's public utilities were preceded by negotiations with the Municipal Council, and the price increases did not exceed 20%. If the "automatic adjustment" method of public utilities were followed, allowing each company to calculate at will, the rate of price increase would be a considerable figure! However, in terms of the time interval, the new prices of public utilities this time are only one month apart from the previous price increase, which seems to set a bad precedent for monthly adjustments. Once this precedent is set, the prices of public utilities will rise steadily month by month and become a major force in the price hike trend. The Speaker of the Municipal Council loudly appealed for the stability of public utility prices for three months, but he did not move the central authorities or the local government. Here, we want to especially call on public opinion to urge the government to effectively stop the bad precedent of monthly price increases in public utilities!

We have always opposed the arbitrary price increases of public utilities. Every time public utilities adjust to new prices, we criticize this driving force that leads to rising prices, and warn public opinion and government authorities to reasonably regulate public utilities in policy, so that public utilities truly fulfill their social service duties and do not use this as a tool to exploit the people. Why do we oppose the arbitrary price increases of public utilities and advocate for reasonable regulation? There are three reasons:

(1) Public utilities are monopolistic undertakings related to social welfare and the people's livelihood. This monopoly is based on the purpose of social service, and it is a monopoly enterprise that is publicly owned, publicly used, and publicly needed. Its nature is by no means comparable to "trusts" or "cartels," and its prices are absolutely not allowed to be manipulated for profit. If public utilities are operated reasonably and managed well, there should be no losses. If there are losses, temporary relief should also be provided by the national or municipal treasury as appropriate.

(2) The prices of public utilities are not fixed, but if price increases are necessary, the affordability of the public, especially the common people, should be taken into account. Arbitrary automatic adjustments based on their own standards for adjusting prices cannot be allowed. Reasonable price increases should be implemented in a fair and progressive manner with the support of public opinion. The procedures for price increases in state-owned railways, postal services, telecommunications, etc. should be approved by the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, the procedures for price increases in municipally or privately owned gas, water, electricity, trams, buses, etc. should be approved by the Municipal Council. Some scholars advocate for state or municipal operation of public utilities. The so-called state or municipal operation does not depart from the scope of state or private operation and municipal operation and management. The current public utilities are government-operated and government-managed, or privately-operated and government-managed, which should be reasonably improved.

(3) The existing public utilities have too low efficiency, too many employees, and huge expenses. They lack both "administrative efficiency" and "scientific management." Therefore, all public utilities have become a waste of resources. We hope that the government authorities will manage public utilities from the perspective of social and economic policies, establish a reasonable regulatory system, supervise their accounting, monitor their efficiency, and enable public utilities themselves to maintain a balance of income and expenditure after reducing staff and saving costs.

Based on the above three points, we oppose the bad precedent of monthly price increases in public utilities, and we ask public opinion and government authorities to study and establish methods for rationalizing public utilities. The Shanghai Municipal Council, in order to stabilize public utility prices, is now preparing to investigate the actual operating profits and losses, personnel allocation, fuel usage, price calculation formulas, and capital operation methods of public utilities. The spirit of the Council issuing this kind of service with a sense of responsibility to the citizens is commendable. It is hoped that this investigation will not be in vain, and that technical experts will contribute their opinions to study a method for improving public administration and a policy for rationalizing public utilities, and provide them to the government for implementation.

Regarding the issue of subsidies for public utilities, many people are now advocating this and plan to request the central government to restore subsidies. On the surface, subsidizing public utilities is a good measure to curb price increases, and we also agree with this relief method. However, before subsidies are actually provided, the management of public utilities must be reasonable, and the waste of public utilities themselves must be eliminated. Not only should there be no waste in employment and expenses, but the use of raw materials and capital should also comply with factory technical methods and accounting principles. Otherwise, the economics of public utilities themselves will be a waste of resources. Waste is a bottomless pit, and using subsidies to fill this pit will never work. Therefore, subsidies for public utilities must be effective only after rationalized management policies for public utilities are implemented soundly and effectively.

In short, we demand rationalized public utilities and rationalized regulatory policies, so that public utilities truly exert their social service role and serve the social population and economic facilities, so that the social population does not suffer from shortages and economic facilities are more active. Truly achieving "public" that does not burden the people and "use" that does not harm wealth is the purpose of our consistent emphasis on public utilities.

The meeting also discussed whether to expand the scope of rationing, but no concrete decision was made. The distribution of cotton was decided to be rationed to various private factories, and the rationing work will be presided over by the Cotton, Yarn, and Fabric Management Committee, with the amount of distribution determined by the number of spindles in each factory. The gasoline portion will be allocated by the Fuel Management Committee. In addition to a portion of the fertilizer being transported to Taiwan in exchange for rice and grains, a portion will be used for agricultural loans. The entire use of U.S. aid will be jointly decided by China and the United States after Mr. Lapham, head of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Mission to China, arrives in China. Mr. Lapham is expected to arrive in China at the beginning of next month. In addition, the meeting on the 13th also discussed the technical issues related to the establishment of the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee, and it was decided that the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee should be established as soon as possible to carry out the execution of U.S. aid transportation work.

### The Field Tax Management Measures in the Pacification Zone Have Been Slightly Revised This Year. In Order to Remedy the Loss of Tax Grain and Enrich the Grain Source for Suppression of Rebellion.

[Our Nanjing Office, 13th] The Field Tax Grain Management Measures in the Pacification Zone have been slightly revised recently. In the thirty-sixth year of the Republic, the counties in the Pacification Zone, after the scope determined by the Deputy Minister of National Defense, reached more than 500 counties, all of which were included in the list of deducted grain quotas. Since the grain quotas in these more than 500 counties are very large, in order to remedy the loss of tax grain and ensure that the grain source for suppression of rebellion is sufficient, some revisions have been made so that the execution by the central and local governments is not only more convenient than before, but also easier to implement. The text of the revised Article 3 is as follows: The collection and exemption of field tax in the recovered counties shall be handled in accordance with the following provisions: (1) If the provincial government dispatches personnel from the provincial Land and Grain Office to the recovered counties in the Pacification Zone to investigate and confirm that the entire territory has been occupied by the Communist bandits for more than one year, and that more than one-half of the area has just been recovered and field tax cannot be levied, in addition to waiving the arrears of tax from previous years before the recovery, the field tax for the current year may be reported to the provincial government for submission to the central government for approval and waiver. Counties exempted from tax with approval shall be given appropriate monthly subsidies by the national treasury during the tax exemption period, and the subsidy standards shall be determined separately by the Ministry of Finance. (2) If the provincial government dispatches personnel from the provincial Land and Grain Office to the recovered counties in the Pacification Zone to investigate and confirm that the entire territory has been disrupted and damaged by bandits, with losses reaching more than 70%, and has just been recovered, in addition to waiving all arrears of tax from previous years, all grain collected for tax in the current year may be retained in full for local administrative and construction purposes, and the 30% payable to the central government and the 20% payable to the provincial government shall be exempted. (3) If only part of the counties recovered in the Pacification Zone have been disrupted by Communist bandits, or have only been damaged by Communist bandits, with losses of less than 70%, field tax shall still be levied and allocated in accordance with regulations. (4) In order to facilitate the promotion of local administration in the Pacification Zone, the national treasury shall allocate special funds in addition to the post-recovery subsidy fee to the provincial government of the Pacification Zone for overall planning and dispatch. For counties with particularly severe disasters, they shall be allocated first and exempted from tax after approval, and deducted from the subsidy fees to be allocated.
