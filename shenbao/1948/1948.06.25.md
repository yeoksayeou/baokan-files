[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] Reliable sources say that President Chiang Kai-shek convened an important military conference in Xi'an to discuss the Central Plains war situation and bandit suppression strategies. Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Service Forces Guo Chan, Director of the First Department of the Ministry of National Defense Hou Teng, Director of the Political Warfare Bureau Deng Wenyi, and their entourage, were summoned by the President via telegram and flew from Nanjing to Xi'an on a special plane at 9:00 AM on the 24th to attend the conference.

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch on the 24th] It is reported that the President convened a military conference of senior Northwest generals in Xi'an. Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the local Headquarters, Vice Director and Qinghai Chairman Ma Bufang, and 81st Division Commander Ma Hongbin, etc., all flew to Shaanxi on a special plane at 8:00 AM on the morning of the 4th.

[Our Xi'an Dispatch on the 24th] Zhang Zhizhong, together with Ma Hongbin and others, flew from Lanzhou to Xi'an this afternoon. Furthermore, Guo Chan, Hou Teng, Deng Wenyi, and their entourage also arrived in Xi'an this afternoon on a special plane from Nanjing.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] A major battle is brewing in the Yellow River flood area in eastern Henan. The majority of Chen Yi's bandit troops have fled south across the Longhai Railway from western Shandong, to the area south of Neihuang and Lankao, and the area between Qi County and Fugou. Some of Chen's bandits who attacked Kaifeng have also fled south to the vicinity of Weishi. Those who were between Zhongmou and Xiangsha have fled to the area of Xinzheng and Mi County. It appears that all have been concentrated on the great plains of eastern Henan. The National Army is pressing the bandits from Minquan, Queshan, Zhumadian, Zhengzhou, and western Shandong, and is attacking Qi County with strong forces in order to defeat the main force of the bandits in this vast area.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 24th] The Yellow Sea Air Force squadron flew on the 24th to widely search the Qi County and Chenliu highway southeast of Bian, and the area between Tongxu and Zhuxian Town. The handcarts and scattered vehicles of the bandit's 33rd and 55th units were the main bombing targets. Also, a large part of the supplies looted from Kaifeng by the bandits was transported to the north bank of the Yellow River, and a portion was transported south to eastern Henan.

[Our Xi'an Dispatch on the 24th] The majority of the bandits in western Henan fled east, returning to the Pinghan Railway. Liu Bocheng's First and Second Columns, and Chen Geng's Fourth and Ninth Columns, have fled to Xiejiadian and Xindian west of Wuyang, and the advance troops have crossed Wuyang. In addition, a strong National Army contingent in northern Shaanxi captured Baishui County in one fell swoop at 7:00 AM on the 24th.

### Legislative Yuan Reviews War Situation; He Yingqin Points Out Reasons for Kaifeng's Fall and Declares Zhengzhou Can Absolutely Be Secured

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] The Legislative Yuan held a special session all day on the 24th to review the Central Plains war situation. The session began at 9:00 AM, presided over by President Sun Ke. Minister of National Defense He Yingqin, accompanied by Vice Minister Xiao Yisu, attended upon invitation. After announcing the start of the meeting, He Yingqin gave a one-hour report. He first explained that the Organic Law of the Ministry of National Defense was being revised, and that the principles guiding current military operations had already been reported by President Weng in response to inquiries about administrative policies. He reiterated that the Minister of National Defense was responsible for military administration, while military orders were directed by the Chief of Staff, who acted upon the President's orders. The Chief of Staff was the chief of staff to the commander-in-chief and the administrative officer of the Minister of National Defense. In peacetime, military administration was more important than military orders, while in wartime, military administration supported military orders. He also stated that Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong was unable to attend because he was summoned by the President to fly to Xi'an at 9:00 AM that morning, and therefore the military order component could not be explained in detail. Secondly, He Yingqin analyzed the rapid expansion of the communist forces' power after the victory. Their troop strength and light weapons were now comparable to the National Army, but they were still no match for the National Army in terms of heavy weapons, naval, and air forces. As for the Kaifeng campaign, the fundamental reasons for the defeat and the fall of the important town were the failure of intelligence work and the misjudgment of the enemy situation. However, he emphasized that the temporary loss of Kaifeng could not be regarded as a complete failure of the Central Plains war. He read aloud the telegrams from generals Liu Zhi, Liu Ruming, and other commanders currently directing operations in the Central Plains battlefield, proving that the National Army was actively launching a campaign to annihilate the bandit forces in order to reverse the Central Plains war situation and recover Kaifeng. Finally, he repeatedly declared that there was absolutely no problem in ensuring the security of Zhengzhou. After He Yingqin's report, many committee members from Henan and North China provinces spoke in succession, vehemently criticizing the various responsibility issues related to the loss of Kaifeng. Most of their opinions focused on the following points: (1) The bandit suppression military strategy was inappropriate. The National Army was defending its territory and being passively attacked, while the bandit army aimed to destroy the National Army's combat power and was maneuvering everywhere. Countermeasures should be sought in the future; (2) Command was overstepped, responsibility was unclear, and deployment was unconstitutional, which must be corrected; (3) Rewards and punishments were unfair, and soldiers did not risk their lives. Factional prejudices should be eliminated in the future; (4) Military discipline was deteriorating, and local forces were not fully coordinated or utilized. Serious rectification should be carried out in the future, and attention should be paid to the effective assistance of local forces. Some committee members were heartbroken by the phenomenon that important strongholds and stockpiled military supplies were not utilized and were abandoned to the enemy. Some committee members criticized the Air Force for neglecting the lives of our military and civilians, and that bombing the walls of Kaifeng during the mixed battle was inappropriate. The majority of committee members demanded that derelict combat intelligence personnel be severely punished. A total of fifty to sixty committee members spoke throughout the day. He Yingqin responded to the inquiries of the committee members in the afternoon and expressed his sincere acceptance of the constructive opinions of the committee members. However, due to the difficulty in clarifying the responsibility issues, most committee members were not satisfied. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.

### He Yingqin Scheduled to Fly to Beiping Today

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 24th] He Yingqin is scheduled to fly to Beiping on the 25th to inspect. Northern generals will also gather in their hometown.

Also, Zhang Fakui returned to Beiping from Tianjin at 6:30 PM this afternoon and will transfer to Nanjing within days.

### Henan People in Nanjing to Petition Today for Handling Kaifeng Relief and Rehabilitation; Report of Liu Maoen's Death Unconfirmed

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] After the situation in Kaifeng became unclear, the serious deaths of our military, civilian, public education personnel, and students have been widely reported here. Henan people in Nanjing, legislative and supervisory committee members, and National Assembly representatives have been extremely indignant and saddened in recent days. On the 24th, they gathered at the Central Hotel at 9:00 AM and 9:00 PM to discuss relief for refugees and students and to commemorate the compatriots who died in the disaster. Most of those who attended in the morning were National Assembly representatives and provincial senators. At the evening meeting, more than one hundred Henan legislative and supervisory committee members, National Assembly representatives, provincial senators, and people in Nanjing participated. Zhang Fang, a respected elder from Henan Province, also came to Nanjing from Jiangxi via Shanghai on the 24th to jointly plan for the aftermath. Zhang Fang presided over the evening meeting.

[Our Zhengzhou Dispatch on the 24th] Reports of the deaths of Henan Chairman Liu Maoen and Finance Director Meng Zhaozan have not been confirmed.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 24th] The stationmaster of Kaifeng Station, railway employees, and more than 1,500 Kaifeng public education personnel arrived in Xuzhou by train from Shangqiu on the 24th.

### Liu Maoen Possibly Committed Suicide by Self-Immolation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] Henan Legislative Committee member Duan Jianmin said on the 24th that, according to information he had received, regarding the report of Liu Maoen's death, Liu's special agent police chief had sent a telegram to the Henan Provincial Government's Beijing Office reporting that the situation in Kaifeng was critical on the 19th. Liu had invited his wife and brother Zhenhua to live in the Provincial Government, saying that if necessary, they would die together. On the 21st, the bandits set fire to the Provincial Government everywhere. Liu invited his subordinates and advised them to escape quickly, but he himself decided to die for the trust the leader had placed in him and would not leave the Provincial Government. His subordinates advised him to leave, but Liu refused. When the special agent battalion commander and others left on the 22nd, they saw the Provincial Government on fire. Chairman Liu was thought to have committed suicide by self-immolation at that time, and his brother Zhenhua was also inside. However, Duan stated that this news has not been officially confirmed.

### National Banks Adopt Differential Interest Rate Principles While Maintaining Low-Interest Policy

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] The issue of interest rates on loans from national banks was discussed at the board meeting of the Four Banks Joint Administration on the 24th. It was generally believed that it was necessary to increase interest rates, but the impact on stimulating commodity prices after the interest rate increase should also be taken into consideration. Finally, it was decided that the principle of maintaining a low-interest policy should be maintained, and differential interest rates should be adopted. Those that truly needed to be increased should be increased appropriately.

[Another Dispatch] The Four Banks Joint Administration held its 366th board meeting on the morning of the 24th, presided over by Weng Wenhao. It approved the handling methods for loan and finished product purchase cases, and the calculation methods for deposit interest rates from December 9, 1941, to Victory Day.

### Fierce Battles on the Outskirts of Qinhuangdao; Beidaihe and Beicang Station Lost and Regained; National Army Meets at Gubeikou

[Our Qinhuangdao Dispatch on the 24th] Qinhuangdao suddenly became tense on the night of the 23rd. From 2:00 AM on the 24th, the sound of artillery in the city gradually intensified, shaking the roofs. From 9:00 AM, the navy fired artillery to assist in the battle, resounding throughout the city. However, the city was peaceful. The bandits concentrated between Qian'an and Funing moved near the railway two days ago. From midnight on the 23rd, they launched a full-scale attack. The fighting west of Qinhuangdao did not stop on the 24th. The main battlefield was in Beidaihe, where the provincial defense battalion was surrounded by five or six regiments of bandits. The National Army put up a strong resistance, and the fighting was fierce. In addition, the bandits' Eleventh Column, attached to a cavalry brigade, besieged Changli. Another two columns of bandits (possibly the Eighth and Twelfth Columns) continued to arrive, and a major battle may take place. It is now difficult to contact Changli from here. Fan Hanjie happened to come to Qinhuangdao to take command. The National Army east of Shanhaiguan and Tangshan has taken a pincer attack posture to encircle the attacking bandits. Qinhuangdao is safe. In addition, a repair train has been dispatched to rescue the armored trains blocked between the stations.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang Dispatch on the 24th] Military news: The fighting on the outskirts of Qinhuangdao has broken out again. More than 10,000 bandits launched an attack on Yantongshan, Qiyun Temple, and Beidaihe Station at dawn on the 24th, and engaged in fierce fighting with the defending troops in those areas.

Changli was engaged in fierce fighting in the northeastern suburbs.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch on the 24th] Beicang Station, between Beiping and Tianjin on the Beining Railway, was captured by the bandits on the morning of the 24th. The offices inside the station were burned down, and the deputy stationmaster Song Zhigong and several workers were captured. After the National Army rushed to rescue them, the bandits retreated after a fierce battle until dawn. A total of fourteen sections of the road between Nancang, Beicang, and Yangcun were destroyed and were repaired and opened to traffic that day.

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 24th] The National Army inside and outside Gubeikou met yesterday evening. The bandits were divided and retreated to the northwest and northeast.

[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 24th] Fierce fighting has resumed on the outskirts of Longshan in the west of the Jiaoji Railway. The remnants of the New Seventh and Eleventh Divisions of the Bohai Column of bandits regrouped with the Twenty-fifth, Twenty-sixth, and Twenty-seventh Divisions of the Ninth Column on the night of the 23rd and launched a fierce attack on Zhangqiu and Longshan in several routes. One group even infiltrated Baitazhuang and Shanhoushai southeast of Longshan. In order to adopt an absolute mobile warfare tactic and select favorable terrain to annihilate them, the National Army automatically transferred its main force to the vicinity of Guodian at noon on the 24th. Also, the fighting in the Taishan area was still fierce south of Wande on the 24th.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 24th] The situation on the outskirts of Yanzhou has stabilized.

### Large Amounts of Capital Fleeing to Hong Kong, Confirmed by Commissioners of the Four Banks Joint Administration; Startling Increase in Bank Deposits After the War

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] The large-scale flight of domestic capital to Hong Kong has now been confirmed. Xu Changcheng, the commissioner of the Four Banks Joint Administration stationed in Hong Kong, recently submitted an investigation report on the large-scale flight of capital to the Four Banks Joint Administration, which listed several figures obtained from the investigation. It is reported that the biggest proof of capital flight to Hong Kong is the sharp increase in bank deposit accounts and deposit figures after the war. According to bank personnel, before the war, there were only one or two depositors with deposits of more than 10 million yuan, more than ten with more than 5 million yuan, and very few with more than 1 million yuan. After the war, there were more than 1,000 new depositors with deposits of more than 10 million yuan, nearly 10,000 with more than 5 million yuan, and countless with more than 1 million yuan. This is just the deposit situation of one foreign bank in Hong Kong, and the numbers are startling. The amount deposited in other banks and used for investment in real estate and stocks is even greater. The Hong Kong government issued a total of 300 million new Hong Kong dollars without reserve funds after the war. However, it is generally estimated that only 50 million Hong Kong dollars is needed for circulation in the Hong Kong market. The rest is in the hands of Chinese people for investment or to absorb materials. In terms of investment, someone recently purchased land and built a factory in To Kwa Wan, Kowloon, for several million Hong Kong dollars, which was several times more than the reserve price. Another wealthy businessman from Shanghai purchased land in Kowloon for 740,000 Hong Kong dollars. There are also many people engaged in remittance operations. All of these points confirm that domestic capital has indeed fled to Hong Kong in large quantities after the war.

### Deng Xihou Arrives in Chengdu

### Control Yuan Exercises Confirmation Power; All Four Presidential Nominees for Presidents and Vice Presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuans Pass with Majority Vote

[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] President Chiang Kai-shek issued the following orders on the 24th: (1) Appointing Wang Chonghui as President of the Judicial Yuan; (2) Appointing Shi Zhiquan as Vice President of the Judicial Yuan; (3) Appointing Zhang Boling as President of the Examination Yuan; (4) Appointing Jia Jingde as Vice President of the Examination Yuan.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] The first Control Yuan under the Constitution exercised its power of confirmation for the first time on the 24th in accordance with the Constitution. It held a vote by secret ballot on the President's nominations of Wang Chonghui as President of the Judicial Yuan, Shi Zhiquan as Vice President, Zhang Boling as President of the Examination Yuan, and Jia Jingde as Vice President, requesting the Control Yuan's consent. As a result, all four nominees passed with a majority of affirmative votes and were reported to the President.

Ninth Meeting

The President's nomination message was delivered to the Control Yuan on the 23rd. The Control Yuan held its ninth meeting at 9:30 AM on the 24th to announce it. After the secretariat read the President's message, Committee Member Tao Baichuan made a temporary motion, stating that the plenary review meeting of the Control Yuan to exercise its power of confirmation was not a matter of military, national defense, or diplomatic state secrets, and there was no need for secrecy. News reporters should be allowed to attend and observe. Tao explained that this was about people, not about things, and there was no secrecy. He also said that if the reporters were kept outside, the so-called secrecy would only be an act of self-deception. Yang Lingde was the first to stand up and express his agreement. However, Gu Fengxiang, Liang Shangdong, Liu Xingzhi, and others expressed their opposition, believing that they could not contradict themselves and overturn the regulations they had set. They should not be submitted for a vote or discussion. The chairman then declared that it would be handed over to the plenary review committee for handling. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM, and Huang Jue was appointed as the chairman of the plenary review committee, which then convened.

Plenary Review Committee

At the beginning of the review committee meeting, the chairman first raised the issue of a closed meeting. It was unanimously argued that the motion could not be established and should not be submitted for discussion. The chairman announced that, in accordance with Article 2 of the Regulations on the Exercise of the Power of Confirmation, the plenary review committee would be chaired by one committee member, and the meeting would be held in secret. All persons other than committee members were asked to leave.

During the discussion, most committee members believed that the content of the President's message was too simple and did not include resumes and credentials as stipulated in the Regulations on the Exercise of the Power of Confirmation drafted by the Control Yuan. Some committee members believed that it was not necessary to send resumes because the Regulations on the Exercise of the Power of Confirmation had not been sent to the President for review, and the President was not aware of this additional condition. Moreover, Wang Chonghui and Zhang Boling, who were nominated this time, were not only accomplished scholars in China but also enjoyed international renown. This condition should not be raised. If such harsh conditions were to be imposed, it would be tantamount to making virtuous people unwilling to serve, because they were nominated and not volunteering. Another group of committee members believed that the President's message did not include resumes and credentials, which was a violation of the law. The dispute lasted for several hours, and the meeting adjourned without a result at noon.

Voting Results

In the afternoon, President Yu Youren informed the President's Office of this matter. The President's Office then rushed to prepare documents and sent a copy of the resumes of the four nominees to the Control Yuan. The Control Yuan continued to hold a plenary review committee in the afternoon, briefly reviewed the resumes, and then declared it complete. After a break, the plenary session was reconvened to conduct the voting. The voting was very quick that day. There were 146 committee members present, 146 ballots issued, and 146 votes cast. (1) Wang Chonghui received 132 affirmative votes, 12 negative votes, and 2 invalid votes. (2) Shi Zhiquan received 123 affirmative votes, 18 negative votes, and 5 invalid votes. (3) Zhang Boling received 127 affirmative votes, 16 negative votes, and 3 invalid votes. (4) Jia Jingde received 104 affirmative votes, 36 negative votes, and 6 invalid votes. Yu Youren announced the results at 6:30 PM, and all committee members applauded enthusiastically.

### Ambassador Wellington Koo Visits Yermol Regarding Military Aid to China's Tiger Gate Procedures; Gilbert Appointed Deputy Director of Aid to China

[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] Our Ambassador to the United States, Wellington Koo, met with Assistant Secretary of State Yermol on the 23rd to discuss the procedures for $125 million in military aid to China. They also discussed the bilateral agreement for $275 million in economic aid to China and other matters. Koo stated that negotiations on the bilateral agreement are currently being held in Nanjing.

[United Press, Washington, 24th] Officials from the War Department and the State Department stated that the current military aid to China program operates as follows: The Chinese government submits requests for military supplies to the U.S. government, accompanied by documents indicating that the aid will be used effectively and managed by the Chinese army. The War Department and the State Department then review China's request and authorize the Chinese government to obtain the funds. The review includes general and rough oversight of the funds, but does not involve social oversight of the military aspects of the aid to China program.

[City News] Lapham announced yesterday the appointment of Gilbert, the head of the China Relief Mission, as Deputy Director of Aid to China. Lapham emphasized that while the official headquarters of the Economic Cooperation Administration will be located in Nanjing, Shanghai will be its primary base of operations. It is expected that most of the Economic Cooperation Administration's personnel will be stationed in Shanghai. Lapham stated, "I will spend much of my time in locations outside of Shanghai, not only going to Nanjing but also visiting other parts of China. I must have sufficient freedom to handle the overall objectives of the delegation, and therefore, I hope that Mr. Gilbert can shoulder and manage all the activities of the Economic Cooperation Administration in China."

Lapham continued, "The Congressional reduction of the Economic Cooperation Administration's funds makes it even more difficult for us to decide how to use the funds finally allocated by Congress to benefit China most effectively." He predicted that the $275 million aid allocation to China could be distributed by April 3, 1949.

Rumors circulate that Liu Mao-en, Chairman of Henan Province, died in the Battle of Kaifeng.

Editorial

### Reversing the Decline of the Central Plains Battlefield

The Legislative Yuan held a temporary closed-door meeting yesterday morning to review the reasons for the defeat in the Central Plains and the responsibility for the fall of Kaifeng. The members spoke one after another, all with passion and righteous indignation, lamenting the critical situation of the Central Plains battlefield. Minister of National Defense General He Yingqin was also invited to attend, explained the decline of the Central Plains battlefield, and answered questions from the legislators. The future development of the Central Plains battlefield is indeed a concern for the entire nation. Minister He said that he is determined to do everything possible to win. We also hope so, because today's overall situation in China depends on the success or failure of the suppression of the bandits. The authorities responsible for military affairs are truly burdened with the safety and security of the world.

The gains and losses of the Central Plains battles not only concern the safety of Henan Province but also affect the entire war situation. The defending forces in Kaifeng, after six days and nights of bloody fighting, withdrew to the suburbs on the 22nd at noon to continue fighting the bandit army in the city. The fall of this famous city in the Central Plains to the bandits is now undeniable. As of this writing, the reinforcements heading towards Kaifeng, the Qiu Corps advancing from Lanfeng, have only reached ten miles from the outskirts of Kaifeng. The National Army advancing eastward from Zhengzhou is still fighting the bandit army in Zhongmou. The National Army heading north from Weishi has not yet crossed Zhuxian Town. The so-called National Army's three-pronged convergence on Kaifeng still seems to be some time away. The decline of the Central Plains battlefield has not improved. At this moment, we are only anxious and depressed, which does not help the overall situation. Rather than investigating the responsibility for the defeat in the Central Plains and the fall of Kaifeng, it is better for the responsible military authorities to be determined to ensure Zhengzhou and recover Kaifeng as soon as possible to reverse the decline of the Central Plains battlefield.

Henan is the central fortress in the Central Plains battlefield, especially the southwest of Henan Province, with its dangerous terrain, strong local customs, and the foundation of local armed forces. It is the central fortress of the central fortress. Therefore, from a geographical point of view, the fall of Kaifeng to the bandits not only means the fall of the entire Henan Province but also the area between the Yangtze River, Huai River, Xu River, and Si River will also feel its threat. Legislator Ma Chengfeng and others suggested that the Legislative Yuan review the reasons for the failure in the Central Plains and issued a long speech, loudly appealing and lamenting the importance of defending Kaifeng, and put forward a shocking slogan. He said: "If you can't protect the southwest of Henan, you can't protect Henan; if you can't protect Henan, you can't protect the Yangtze River!" We only need to look at the war situation in Henan to prove that their appeals are not purely alarmist. Look at Shanxi Province, most of which has been occupied by the bandit army for a long time. Look at southern Hebei, western Shandong, northern Hubei, and southern Shaanxi, which are almost all places where the bandit army appears. Therefore, once Kaifeng falls, Zhengzhou is isolated, and if it cannot be secured, and this section of the Jinpu Railway is completely under the control of the bandit army, then the communists, echoing each other from east to west, will form a single front and block the National Army north and south of Henan. If so, not only will the deterioration of the Central Plains battlefield reach an irreversible point, but the defense of Xuzhou, Xi'an, and Wuhan may also face increased difficulties. Therefore, we say that the Central Plains battlefield is a major key to the entire anti-communist military campaign, which is by no means an exaggeration.

At the beginning of this communist offensive against Kaifeng, on one hand, they feigned a large-scale offensive in western Shandong, attracting a large number of National Army forces and leaving the defenses in southwestern Henan Province empty. On the other hand, they gathered more than 60,000 troops from the Chen and Liu bandit units and took the opportunity to attack the suburbs of Kaifeng. If the National Army's intelligence was accurate and its fighting spirit was strong, with some preparation beforehand and rapid reinforcements afterward, there is no reason why Kaifeng could not have been defended for a long time and the siege relieved. However, the National Army stationed in Kaifeng had only two regiments, plus the local security forces, which lacked complete weaponry. How can we blame them for not holding out for a long time with exhausted troops against ferocious and stubborn bandits? The communist bandits arrived ten miles outside Kaifeng on the 17th, and by the 19th, they had broken through the city's defenses and entered the urban area, entering the stage of street fighting. The defending forces fought valiantly to the death for six days and nights before withdrawing to the suburbs. The Chairman of Henan Province, Liu Mao-en, was also reported to have died in the line of duty, perishing with the city. It can be seen that the defending forces bear less responsibility for the fall of Kaifeng. If, during the Kaifeng defending forces' tenacious defense, the National Army in Zhengzhou, Nanyang, and Hanzhong could have quickly rushed to the rescue, arriving as ordered, then the siege of Kaifeng would not have been impossible to relieve. From this, we can see that the lack of unified military and political orders, and the decline of the morale of the reinforcements, cannot but be held responsible for the defeat in the Central Plains. In fact, the deterioration of the Central Plains battlefield began in September last year when the bandit army crossed the river from southwestern Henan Province, and became serious with the fall of Luoyang in March this year. However, the military authorities have never raised their vigilance on this matter, leaving only two regiments of the National Army to defend Kaifeng, while the central government was busy convening meetings to reorganize the government and compete for positions and power, putting military and national affairs on the back burner, which led to the fall of the famous city in the Central Plains. At the same time, the military authorities failed to make full use of the local armed forces in Henan Province, which had a solid foundation. According to legislator Ma Chengfeng's report, it was as difficult as ascending to heaven for the local Henan teams to obtain weapons and ammunition from the central government. How can we expect these local troops with incomplete weaponry to defend the local area? These past mistakes and failures are worthy of deep reflection by the military authorities in the future. The past cannot be blamed, but the future can be pursued. We hope that the military authorities will thoroughly and decisively change their course!

Reviewing the military situation over the past year, the power of the communist bandits has been expanding day by day, and they have changed from guerrilla warfare to positional warfare, and from destroying transportation lines to capturing large strongholds. The communist bandits' capture of Luoyang in March this year and their recent capture of Kaifeng are clear evidence. Looking back at the National Army, it has changed from active to passive. In the past, it could still defend lines and points, but now it seems unable to defend even important strongholds. Although the military authorities are advocating "total war," if we continue in this way, without changing the old habits, then the result of procrastination and perfunctoriness will make it very difficult to reverse the military decline. The people of the country have great expectations for the newly appointed Minister of National Defense He Yingqin and Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong, but whether they can reverse the current military decline will depend on whether the National Army can converge on Kaifeng, boost morale, and recover Kaifeng.

Witnessing the daily increase in military decline, we have long felt distressed and indignant, but we have remained silent, unwilling to express our inner troubles, lest we increase the reader's anxiety about the overall situation. However, in today's critical situation in the Central Plains and in today's situation where every citizen is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation, we really cannot remain silent. In fact, today's military problems are not complicated. In short, one is the issue of unified command and changing strategy; the other is how to strictly enforce rewards and punishments so that officers and soldiers can share hardships together, in order to encourage the morale of the front line. Minister He has also mentioned this before, but unfortunately, there has not been time to implement it. We hope that Minister He can use great courage and perseverance to work quickly, practically, and diligently, so that his troop reorganization plan can be fully implemented. We also hope that the people of the country will support Minister He and Chief of Staff Gu in their joint goal of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation, strictly enforce military discipline, eliminate corruption, and enable the whole country to contribute its strength and money. If this can be done, then although the overall situation is dangerous, it will not be difficult to reverse the decline in morale and turn around the bad situation in the military!

### Beijing Municipal Council Questions Police Chief; Nearly Turns Into a Brawl

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 24th] The Beijing Municipal Council questioned Police Chief Tang Yongxian today, and the questioning turned into a verbal brawl, nearly becoming a physical fight. After Tang reported on his administration on the afternoon of the 23rd, 13 people continued to question him on nine matters this morning. Among them, the strongest criticism was directed at the unsolved six-life murder case at Lu Zu Ge. Tang replied, first saying, "The meeting hall should emphasize order and not be contentious." The councilors were in an uproar. Tang said, "The councilors do not have three heads and six arms, so they should not be like this." This sentence ended the proceedings, and the council descended into chaos. The councilors rose up to pound the table, and some went forward to turn off the microphone on the podium, preventing Tang from speaking. A cigarette dish also flew from the left side, but missed Tang. Tang angrily left the venue.

### Japan Promotes New Land Reform Plan

— Wu Jiatang

Japan's land reform plan is being steadily advanced under the auspices of the Allied Headquarters. Its successful and effective implementation is worthy of emulation by our countrymen. The purpose of the reform plan is to eliminate the economic cruelty of the tenancy system. The process of implementation has been quite smooth, without unrest, and with very few economic disruptions.

The basic occupation policy of the Allied Headquarters is to prevent Japan from trending towards communism. Therefore, land reform has become a central policy. One thing that is difficult to understand is that land reform is usually the most important part of the Communist Party's plan. However, the Japanese Communist Party strongly opposes the land reform plan. They accuse it of maintaining the private land ownership system as a superficial reform of changing the soup but not the ingredients by the capitalists. The main purpose is not to seek happiness for the laborers, but to maintain capitalist exploitation.

In fact, the real reason for the Japanese Communist Party's opposition is that after the Allied Headquarters implemented this reform, they seized the trump card in their hands and destroyed the Communist Party's propaganda excuse. The success of the Allied Headquarters' plan has made Japanese farmers increasingly unwilling to accept the sweet talk of the Communist Party. I personally feel that China's land reform also urgently needs to be resolved. If a similar plan can be implemented immediately, it can break the Communist Party's "Wang Reform" propaganda offensive. However, I have little research on this issue and can only provide Japanese information for reference by relevant experts.

Of course, the extreme right-wing elements in Japan also strongly oppose the Allied Headquarters' reform plan. Before these people were dismantled in Japan, they were always supported by the large landowners. In those days, the large landowners were like small emperors in the countryside, oppressing tenant farmers and currying favor with the military. The political activities they led were full of stubborn reaction and militarism, with the aim of maintaining their vested interests and the status of the large landowners. On the other hand, at that time, the military also used tenant farmers as political capital, often using touching slogans to tell the tenant farmers that as long as they followed the military, they would eventually get their own land. Coupled with the sweet talk of the prosperity of the Great Japanese Empire after the victory, the Japanese farmers followed their aggressive policies for many years.

However, the implementation of the Allied Headquarters' plan has now deprived both the Communist Party and the extreme right-wing elements of their trump cards. The correctness of this policy direction and the sophistication of its implementation are worthy of special study. The total area of Japan is 142,310 square miles, of which 16 percent is arable, approximately 15,000,000 acres. Forty percent of the total population, roughly six million families, derive their income wholly or partially from cultivation. Each family averages two and a half acres of land, but due to excessive cultivation, the land has become less fertile. Most farmers are unable to maintain a family livelihood. Before the war, about 70 percent of the farmers were tenant farmers. In the contracts between tenants and landlords, it was generally stipulated that half of the actual harvest be paid as rent. At the same time, the tenants had to pay for fertilizers, equipment, and rent. The actual income of the tenants was only a quarter of the harvest. It was very difficult to maintain the family's warmth and food in a good year. If there were natural disasters, there was no guarantee of livelihood. The first thing the Allied Headquarters did in governing Japan was to reform land ownership. On December 9, 1945, the Allied Headquarters issued a directive to the Japanese government, asking it to take the necessary measures to allow farmers to obtain a fairer distribution of their products. The purpose of this reform plan is moderate and practical, similar to the Father of the Nation's advocacy of "land to the tiller." The Japanese land reform plan was finally passed in the National Assembly on October 21, 1946. This plan has two main objectives: (1) to transfer land ownership to the farmers who actually cultivate it; (2) to improve the tenancy system. This plan emphasizes private land ownership, rather than state ownership and collective farming.

I feel that determining land ownership is very meaningful because after this, the Allied Headquarters created a group of small owner-farmers who, although having little land, could freely operate it with their labor. It can also be said that every farm family with one or two acres of land is an entrepreneur and capitalist. In this way, this group of small capitalists has become the broadest and most solid foundation of capitalist society. In a country heading towards communism, this is truly the best medicine. I feel that the theory and implementation steps of this policy itself are especially worthy of emulation by our countrymen. The goal of the land reform plan is to enable four-fifths of the tenant farmers in Japan to cultivate their own land. At the beginning of the implementation, the government first purchased land from the landlords at a price of 750 yen per tan (approximately ten acres), and paid the price with 24-year public bonds. The annual interest rate of the public price is two-thirds of a percent. The government buys land and sells it to tenant farmers at the same price. Payment can be made in a lump sum or in installments. The latter is paid in 30 years, and the annual interest rate is two-thirds of a percent. The law stipulates that the government has the right to purchase the following types of land: (1) Land owned by "absentee landlords" (i.e., what the Japanese call "non-resident landlords"); (2) Rented land that exceeds a certain retention standard; (3) Land of owner-farmers that exceeds the retention limit, unless they and their families can reasonably develop it; (4) Land owned by companies that is not directly related to the company's main business; (5) Land that can be used for agricultural development. In addition, the reform plan stipulates that tenant farmers who cultivated the land locally before November 23, 1945, have the highest priority to purchase the land.

In order to promote this reform plan, a farmland committee was established in each village. The members are all elected from the farmers. The ratio of the number of tenant farmers, owner-farmers, and landlords is 5:2:3. Each category freely elects its representatives to participate in the meeting. Each prefectural committee guides and supervises the work of the county committee, and the prefectural committee itself is guided by the Central Land Committee, which is chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. I think that the smooth progress of the plan is due to the democratic implementation method. At the same time, the plan also stipulates that if farmers cannot fulfill their installment payments due to poor harvests or other legitimate reasons, the government cannot pledge their land. This method also does not allow tenant farmers to become large landlords, and the determination of the land limit standard is based on the arable nature of the land. The ordinary limit is seven and a half acres.

Under this plan, the tenant farmers who are currently cultivating 6.4 million acres will become owner-farmers cultivating 4.9 million acres. The complete eradication of the tenant system is considered unfeasible, but the tenancy system has been greatly improved. The law now stipulates: (1) There must be a written lease; (2) The highest rent for paddy fields is 25 percent of the harvest, and 15 percent for highlands; (3) The rent is paid in cash; (4) Changes and cancellations of the lease must be approved by the farmland committee.

Based on the information I have collected, although the land reform plan has not been implemented for long, it is progressing smoothly. The responsible personnel of the Allied Headquarters also told me that everything is being implemented according to the planned progress. The purchase of land has been implemented since March 31 last year. Within one year, the government has purchased a total of 3,980,000 acres of arable land, and 68,148 acres of land have been resold to farmers. In the process of implementing the plan, there have been incidents of fraud, but on the whole, the Japanese and the responsible personnel of the Allied Headquarters are satisfied with the smooth implementation of the plan. Of course, the large landowners are not happy with this plan, but they know that the Allied Headquarters fully supports this plan and can only accept it.

When I met with MacArthur, I mentioned this land issue. MacArthur pointed out that land reform is the basic policy of any occupying government. He also remembered that as early as the time of Roman Caesar, land reform was implemented on the occupied land. However, when a government's financial resources are insufficient to purchase land, it is very difficult to implement land policies. From his conversation, it is not difficult to see that among the various reforms carried out in Japan, land reform is what MacArthur hopes to perpetuate.

### US Republican Election Reaches Climax, National Convention Begins Voting, Dewey, Vandenberg and Six Others Nominated as Presidential Candidates, Dewey Camp Confident of Victory

[Reuters, Philadelphia, 24th] After holding an all-night meeting yesterday, the Republican National Convention adjourned this morning at 4:00 AM (7:00 AM EST). It was decided that the first vote for presidential candidates would be held at 2:00 PM today (3:00 AM on the 25th, Shanghai time). The meeting last night was mostly taken up by speeches supporting the various candidates.

[Associated Press, Philadelphia, 24th] The Republican Convention is scheduled to hold the first vote for presidential candidates elected by delegates from each state at 2:00 PM EST tonight (3:00 AM on Friday, Shanghai time). Supporters of Dewey claim that 500 votes can be obtained in the second election. Only 548 votes are required to secure the nomination. Victory is certain in the third election. Taft's supporters said that in the first election, Dewey's vote count would not exceed 400.

[Associated Press, Philadelphia, 23rd] The Republican Convention has completed the nomination of presidential candidates and is about to begin voting. The candidates are New York Governor Dewey, Ohio Senator Taft, California Governor Warren, Former Minnesota Governor Stassen, Michigan Senator Vandenberg, and MacArthur of Wisconsin.

[Central News Agency, Philadelphia, 23rd] At today's Republican National Convention, after each state delegation gave its nomination speeches, they followed with pep rallies. This has always been the liveliest scene at American political conventions. For the past three days, the Republican delegates first quietly listened to the eloquent speeches of various important officials, and then passed a 2,000-word platform. Their enthusiasm was uncontainable. After the nominations, they gathered in groups, shouting wildly and supporting the candidates proposed by each state delegation. Various campaign groups in the hotels were actively campaigning. The Dewey camp and the anti-Dewey camp were engaged in fierce competition, unable to yield to each other. The Dewey camp's goal is to obtain enough votes in the first or second vote to win the presidential nomination. The anti-Dewey camp aims to prevent Dewey from achieving the above-mentioned blitzkrieg victory. The anti-Dewey camp wants to suppress Dewey's momentum at the last moment, while the Dewey camp is concentrating its efforts to strive for the top. Forty-seven of Pennsylvania's seventy-three delegates have publicly guaranteed their support for Dewey. Therefore, on the eve of the vote, Dewey seems to have gained an edge.

[Reuters, Philadelphia, 23rd] Senator Vandenberg indicated today that he agreed to be nominated as a presidential candidate. Vandenberg's action excited Taft, Stassen, and other candidates. They believe that Vandenberg's name will attract many votes that were originally intended for New York Governor Dewey. Before the first vote to elect the presidential candidate, Taft and Stassen's supporters made every effort but failed to make Dewey lose his leading position in the nomination competition. Taft and Stassen's supporters even held a meeting all day yesterday to form an alliance to stop Dewey. Taft and Stassen themselves also held several secret meetings yesterday and this morning. Although Stassen told reporters that Dewey could not obtain a majority of the nominations, several larger delegations have expressed their support for Dewey, such as the 33-member Missouri delegation and the 35-member New Jersey delegation.

### Warsaw Conference Discusses Countermeasures to West German Agreement, East German Government to be Established Soon

[Reported by This Newspaper] London, 24th Broadcast: Warsaw News, it is reported that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will leave here for home at 10:00 AM EST on Friday, and most of the other delegates will depart on Saturday. It is expected that a communique will be issued between 1:00 AM and 3:00 AM on Friday.

[Reported by This Newspaper] London, 24th Broadcast: It is reported that the East German government is about to be established, and its provisional capital will most likely be located in Leipzig. One theory is that the Soviet Union intends to make Berlin the capital of East Germany.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 24th] An unconfirmed report says that Sokolovsky, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Forces in Germany, arrived here by special plane from Berlin on the afternoon of the 24th.

[United Press, Washington, 24th] The foreign ministers of the Soviet Union and its seven satellite countries repeated their discussion on the blueprint for the establishment of an East German state and a separate government on the 24th. The second meeting of the major Eastern European conference began at 10:00 AM. Strict security restrictions were enforced during the meeting, and all delegates were ordered to keep the meeting secret.

The official communique stated that the purpose of convening the meeting was to discuss the resolutions of the six-nation London Conference on the future of Germany. The six-nation Western European conference had drafted a plan for Germany, including the establishment of a government in the three Western occupation zones.

Authoritative sources said that the main task of the Warsaw Conference was to establish an East German government to counter the Western plan. Some observers believe that the new state of East Germany will be based in Leipzig, but there is no official confirmation. The "Warsaw Century" newspaper commented, "Due to the current international situation, especially the restoration of aggressive Germany, the necessity of holding this conference goes without saying. The meeting of the foreign and defense ministers of the eight communist countries, at the behest of Moscow, began on the 23rd, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also participated."

[Reuters, Warsaw, 23rd] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and other political leaders from nine European countries and the Soviet occupation zone of Germany are now gathered at the Warsaw Conference to prepare to issue a joint declaration on Germany. The purpose of this meeting is to unify the Slavic countries to support the Soviet Union's proposal to establish an East German state. The main task of the Warsaw Conference will not begin until the 24th, but the chief representatives of the various countries have begun informal talks today. External sources in Poland said that the issue of Poland's western border will not be discussed at the meeting. Well-informed sources here said that before the Warsaw Conference, a meeting of the Communist Information Bureau was held in Prague starting last Saturday. The same sources also said that the Warsaw Conference initiated by the Soviet Union and Poland also invited French Foreign Minister Bidault to participate, but the Warsaw Conference's communique did not mention the participation of the leaders of the German, Italian, and French communist parties.

[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] The Soviet authorities took the first retaliatory step against the Western Allies today, ordering the cutoff of electricity supply to the British, American, and French zones of Berlin, and blocking the only railway line between Berlin and the West German occupation zones, the "Berlin-Helmstedt" railway. The Soviet side claimed that due to "technical disturbances" on the railway line, they had to stop its traffic. As for the cessation of electricity supply, it was due to the lack of fuel for power generation in the Soviet zone.

Lao, chairman of the German Economic Commission in the Soviet zone, said that if Berlin does not receive air support, serious economic difficulties will occur in the West Berlin area. Eleven days ago, US Commander-in-Chief Clay said that he could transport food by plane to support Berlin as a "short-term emergency measure," so it would be very difficult to rely on air support for a long time.

[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] Herbert, the commander of the British forces in Berlin, issued a notice, instructing residents to be calm and not to panic, telling them that the food reserves are temporarily sufficient. Although the Soviet Union's cutoff of electricity supply to the West Berlin area will cause inconvenience, the West Berlin authorities are already trying to remedy it. (According to the BBC Berlin reporter, the food reserves in the British, American, and French zones of Berlin are only enough for three days. If the Soviet Union blocks railway freight for a long time, the food problem for the two million Germans in the West Berlin area will cause panic.)

### Britain Attaches Importance to the Turbulent Situation in Malaya, Singapore Searches and Arrests Communists, British Army Commander-in-Chief of Southeast Asia Flies to Kuala Lumpur

[Reuters, Singapore, 23rd] British Army Commander-in-Chief of Southeast Asia General Leach flew to Kuala Lumpur by special plane today to meet with Sir Gurney, the British High Commissioner to the Federation of Malaya, to discuss the turbulent situation in Malaya. The military and police of the Malay Peninsula have used the relatively quiet days to complete new deployments to deal with terrorist activities. British troops have also begun deployments in Kedah in the northernmost part of the Malay Peninsula and Johor in the southernmost part.

[Reuters, Singapore, 24th] The Singapore government also promulgated an emergency ordinance today, granting the police emergency powers similar to the emergency powers of the Malayan Federal Police. After receiving the order, the Singapore police launched a search of the headquarters of the Communist Party Democratic Youth League. The police said that they only intended to search and arrest dangerous communist leaders and did not intend to arrest communists on a large scale.

[Associated Press, Singapore, 24th] Five Indians and one Chinese were arrested when the headquarters of the New Democratic Youth League was searched.

### German Monetary Reform Measures, Crisis Can Be Avoided, Western Allies Show Willingness to Compromise

[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] The Western Allies have shown a willingness to compromise today on the monetary reform measures announced by the Soviet Union for East Germany and Greater Berlin. The British authorities first announced that they would not prohibit the import of currency from the Soviet zone into the British zone of Berlin, and would allow the exchange of currency from the British zone and the Soviet zone. The American and French authorities subsequently issued similar statements. This move has temporarily avoided the escalating crisis. The British, American, and French commanders simultaneously announced that the new Deutsche Mark would be used in the West Berlin area, and the exchange of old Deutsche Marks for new Deutsche Marks would begin at 7:00 AM on the 25th in banks in the British and American zones. The Soviet side has not yet shown a willingness to compromise on the monetary reform measures in the West Berlin area.

[Associated Press, Tel Aviv, 23rd] The Irgun Party announced that due to the incident of the munitions ship "Altalena," the party no longer recognizes the Israeli government and ordered its members to leave the Israeli army and be responsible for desertion. The party also said that it had ordered its followers to stop firing in order to avoid Jewish fratricide. Five members of the party were killed on the 22nd for smuggling arms ashore.

### Nishio No-Confidence Motion Rejected by Japanese House of Representatives

Katayama Advises Nishio to Resign Voluntarily

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] The no-confidence motion against Nishio, submitted to the plenary session of the House of Representatives scheduled for 6:15 PM on the 24th, was rejected as a result of the vote. The total number of votes cast was 317, with 209 votes against and 178 in favor. It was rejected by a narrow margin of 11 votes. The meeting adjourned at 7:50 PM.

[Another Dispatch] Nishio visited Katayama on the afternoon of the 23rd to discuss important matters concerning his resignation. Subsequently, Asanuma and Miki also met with Katayama. The content of the Nishio-Katayama meeting was relayed to House Speaker Matsudo by the two. Katayama's intention is still to treat the Nishio incident as an internal party matter as much as possible to open up the situation. Therefore, after 7:00 PM, he reconvened cabinet members and party executives from the Socialist Party to hold a supreme leadership meeting, once again advising Nishio to resign voluntarily. On the other hand, Nishio, considering the strong atmosphere within the party demanding his resignation, seems to have softened his stance on refusing to resign, only stating: "My state of mind has not been understood by people."

### US Invites Foreign Journalists to Japan to Observe Japanese Police and Coast Guard, Aiming to Quell Criticism from Eastern Countries Against the US

[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] At the request of the State Department, the US military authorities today invited foreign journalists to observe the training of Japanese police and coast guard, hoping to stop the criticism from the Soviet Union and Eastern countries that the United States is cultivating Japanese military power. However, only journalists from China and the United States accepted the invitation. In the rural police training school and the Tokyo city recruit training school, the weapons seen by the journalists were no larger than handguns. According to Chief of Security of the Allied General Headquarters, Prime, of the 125,000 police officers in Japan, only 12,000 have service pistols. The Coast Guard is entirely unarmed, but those who can obtain pistols are allowed to carry them. If former special service teams and secret police are excluded, Japan's current police force, though doubled compared to wartime, is still less than what democratic countries actually need.

### British Tramway Workers Briefly Go on Strike, Workers Raise Six Demands, Comply with Order to Resume Normal Operations and Await Mediation

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday morning, in heavy rain, the workers of the British tramway company went on strike. All trams and trolleybuses on all routes did not leave the depot. All workers gathered at the Changde Road and Tilanqiao depots. Upon hearing the news, Mayor Wu telegraphed the Social Affairs Bureau, ordering the tram service to return to normal within two hours. After Zhao Banfu, Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Shen Ding, Director of the Labor Affairs Department, convened representatives of the company's labor union and earnestly persuaded them, all workers, respecting government laws and regulations, resumed work one after another from 12:20 PM yesterday, awaiting a solution.

It is reported that there are three reasons for the workers' strike: (1) During the 7th National Games, ticket seller No. 881, inspector No. 153, and driver No. 130 of the company were selected as representatives for the national wrestling competition. At that time, the Municipal Education Bureau notified the company to grant them official leave, and the Social Affairs Bureau approved the company to pay the three their wages during the National Games period, but the company authorities have not yet complied. (2) The company is plotting to undermine the labor union and alienate workers' feelings. Recently, the company requested the Social Affairs Bureau to allow four senior employees to withdraw from the labor union. The Social Affairs Bureau approved two, and the company authorities each added 30 yuan to their base salaries to show preferential treatment. (3) Matteson, the acting transportation superintendent, arbitrarily dismissed ticket seller No. 277, Que Dasong, and ticket seller No. 1209, Shu Guiqing. When Que and Shu requested reinstatement from Matteson, they were beaten severely by Matteson and another British employee, Goldstein, causing Que's head to bleed profusely.

Due to the above reasons, workers' public anger was aroused, and they raised six demands to the company authorities the day before yesterday: (1) Replace and punish Transportation Superintendent Matteson; (2) Punish timekeeper No. 433; (3) Reinstate ticket sellers No. 1209 and No. 277; (4) Prohibit listening to irresponsible and unsubstantiated "cold reports"; (5) Dismiss employees who withdrew from the labor union; (6) Promptly pay the wages of the representatives who participated in the National Games. After the above conditions were raised, the company did not provide a concrete response, leading to yesterday's strike.

Union Representatives Return to Depot to Persuade

Union Chairman Qiu Changjiang, along with directors Zheng Yangda and Zhou Qingfang, visited Deputy Director Zhao of the Social Affairs Bureau at around 10:00 AM yesterday. Zhao expressed great sympathy for the workers' oppression by Matteson. However, because the tramway is crucial to the city's traffic, he advised the three representatives to first persuade all workers to resume work to avoid affecting the city's traffic. After the three representatives returned to the depot and earnestly persuaded all workers, the workers, understanding the importance of the situation and abiding by government laws and regulations, painfully resumed work first. As a result, all trams from the Changde Road depot departed first at 12:20 PM at noon, and the last tram on route 5 from the Tilanqiao depot also departed at 2:45 PM in the afternoon.

Social Affairs Bureau Advises Company

Deputy Director Zhao summoned Kanaal, the British human resources superintendent of the company, for a discussion yesterday afternoon, inquiring about the various conditions raised by the workers. According to Deputy Director Zhao's statement to reporters afterwards: (1) Regarding the replacement of Matteson, it is an administrative issue for the company, and the Social Affairs Bureau is not in a position to interfere, but the company has been warned to treat the workers with a kind attitude. (2) The dismissed ticket inspectors will be handled after the reasons are investigated. (3) The company has also been advised to cancel the "cold reports" clause. (4) If the employees who withdrew from the union were indeed given additional base salaries by the company, it is quite inappropriate and should be reduced. (5) The company should pay the workers who participated in the National Games in full.

Although the British tramway workers resumed work yesterday, the problem has not yet been resolved. The workers are quietly waiting for the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate today.

### Tea Shop Treatment Dispute, Employees Strike and Petition Yesterday

The issue of adjusting base salaries will be discussed and resolved next Monday when representatives from both labor and management are convened. It is reported that the employees have agreed to resume work first and await mediation.

### Economic Police Brigade, It Is Suggested to Abolish It As Soon As Possible

### Military Friendship Society Board Meeting, Decided to Request the Garrison Command to Unseal, Temporarily Request Bail for Liu Deming

The meeting was held at the Lido Garden in this city at 12:00 noon yesterday.

The Military Friendship Society is a legal local social organization engaged in military-civilian cooperation. Liu Deming is a member recommended by the board of directors to preside over the society's affairs. The houses and some furniture he used in Shanghai were all legally leased by the society from the Factory Pseudo-Property Management Bureau and the Central Trust Bureau. The documents are all there. Today's meeting hopes that you gentlemen will take the stand of the Military Friendship Society and express your opinions on how to deal with the society's problems. Then, Director Pan Gongzhan spoke, stating briefly: The society is one of the social organizations in this city. Its past work achievements and its performance in organizing military support work in recent years are undeniably true facts. The society itself has no illegal activities and should be unsealed and resume business as soon as possible. Whether President Liu himself has committed a crime is another matter and should be his responsibility. Before it is determined, it seems possible to request bail pending trial. If he is indeed illegal, then no one can protect him, etc. Subsequently, directors Wang Xiaolai, Hu Qiuyuan, and Luo Dunwei spoke one after another. Finally, a unanimous decision was made: (1) After the society was sealed up, outsiders did not know the truth and made many speculations. The situation of today's meeting should be publicly announced to correct the situation.

(3) The current status of the society will be maintained, and the reorganization of future business will be decided by the acting chairman Fang to determine three to five directors to organize a reorganization committee to be responsible for handling it.

### A Pioneering Achievement in China's Railway History: Luxurious "Air-Conditioned Train" Scheduled to Run on the Beijing-Shanghai Line

[Special Report from This Newspaper] People living in the midst of war and struggling for the bare necessities of life almost cannot believe that in this era, they can still hear news of progress and construction. However, this is a true fact. The Qishuyan Locomotive Factory of the Two Railway Bureaus is building a "Cool Fire Train," unprecedented in China. Its equipment, structure, and performance are comparable to the first-class trains currently running on European and American railways. The materials it needs, except for a very small number of special parts, are bought with foreign exchange. The remaining 95% are pieced together by ourselves, so the cost is much cheaper. According to their estimates, the cost of each "air-conditioned train" is about 50,000 US dollars. If you order from an American car dealer? 150,000 US dollars per car, and they are not willing to deliver within a short period of time.

Seamless Canvas Seal

The "Air-Conditioned Train" is streamlined, with a large round head and a small round tail. The joints between the two carriages are sealed with thick canvas. From a distance, it looks like a whole, and you can't clearly distinguish each carriage. The canvas is tightened with strong springs, so turning left and right is easy. The windows are made of double-layer glass and embedded in the carriage walls and cannot be opened to prevent heat transfer. Each passenger car has doors at both ends. When passengers get on and off, the doors open, and a small steel ladder automatically extends and lowers. When the door closes, the small ladder automatically retracts and hides under the carriage, which is exquisite and ingenious. For the color of the train, the Railway Bureau specially invited Professor Chen of the Art Department of Central University to design it. The roof is painted silver-gray, and the bottom is painted bright red and cream, with military green at the very bottom. The colors are bright and artistic.

Total Power Generation is 100 Kilowatts

The train is divided into nine carriages. The first carriage is the locomotive, and the second carriage is the generator carriage. After that, there are three consecutive passenger cars. After the three passenger cars, there is a dining car, and behind the dining car, there are two passenger cars. The last carriage is an observation car. The generator carriage is equipped with a small, powerful generator with a power generation of 100 kilowatts, which is just enough to supply the entire train's electricity needs for air conditioning, electric stoves, electric lights, and refrigerators. The remaining space in the generator carriage is used for luggage, postal, and conductor's rooms. Each part is separated by iron doors to ensure safety.

Equipped with Movable Sofa Seats

Passenger cars have two major features: air conditioning and movable sofa seats. The air conditioner is also small, only the size of four seats. Each passenger car is equipped with one unit. The sofa seat is modeled after and improved from the easy chairs in the China National Aviation Corporation's Boeing aircraft. In addition to being able to adjust the backrest up and down, the backrest can also be pulled back to reverse the seat. Because the seats in the carriage are arranged in order, this allows familiar passengers to sit face-to-face like in ordinary train seats. Each passenger car has 50 seats, assigned by number, with the number marked on the top of the chair back. There is also a special small iron frame on the side of the chair back for placing military tickets. After passengers take their seats, they insert the ticket into the frame, and then close their eyes and rest. No ticket inspector will bother you for a while.

### Observation Car for Passengers to Enjoy the Scenery

Both the dining car and the observation car have air conditioning. The dining car restaurant has ten tables and can accommodate 32 people at the same time. The observation car has a small bar, serving wine, snacks, and cold drinks. The layout is modeled after international and Kinmen bars. At the end, there are ten rotating single sofas for passengers to enjoy the scenery along the way. There are also five radios for passengers to listen to at will.

This only luxurious and beautiful train in China's railway history will run on the Beijing-Shanghai line on July 15th, traveling between Beijing and Shanghai once a day. The fare is 20% to 30% higher than the Triumphant, which is not yet determined. More than 300 workers are working day and night to rush to complete the painting and assembly.

### Rampant Cash and Increased Chips, Prices Rise Again Yesterday, A Large Amount of Northern Hot Money Flows South, the Situation is Deteriorating

In order to stabilize prices, the Central Bank decided to sell a large amount of materials to absorb hot money and tighten credit. The method will be to sell sugar, coal, rice, and cloth on the market. Therefore, the advance of the Four Banks and Two Bureaus reached a record high of 291.6 trillion yuan the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, credit was quite tight, but in the afternoon, news suddenly spread that the National Bank had released 800 billion yuan. At the same time, the funds from North China flowing south, which were frozen on various ships, landed in large quantities, and the number of cash chips increased. Therefore, the prices of stocks, cloth, and other goods that had been stable rose again.

Yesterday, the banks in this city showed a phenomenon of being tight on the surface but loose in reality due to the large influx of northern hot money into Shanghai. In the clearing of bills by the silver houses, the Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury once again reversed the situation of the previous day's large advance and showed a large deficit, totaling 854.3 billion yuan. The Central Bank had a deficit of 21.1 billion yuan, the Bank of Communications had a deficit of 51.5 billion yuan, and the China Trust Bureau had a deficit of 48.3 billion yuan.

### Another External Stimulus, Chinese Stocks Booming in the Aftermarket, Foreign Stocks Gaining Momentum, Unified Bonds Stabilizing

At the beginning of the morning, the market was still affected by the shadow of tight credit and did not rise. Yongsheng opened at 4,050 yuan and rose to 4,090 yuan.

The National Bank released funds, and Huaxin hit the limit up, rising to 4,400 yuan at the close. Meiya hit the limit up and then retraced, and Datong was about to hit the limit up at the close. Compared with the morning close, Wuhe, Huani, and Datong all hit the limit up, Meiya, Jinglun, Xinhua, Underwear, Rongfeng, and Jingfu rose by more than 10%, and the rest rose by half a percent.

### Authorities Pay Attention to Traveler's Checks

[Our Newspaper] Recently, many banks and firms in this city have developed traveler's checks to meet actual needs and circulate them on the market. The Financial Supervisory Bureau is paying close attention to this. Insiders said: If the use of such checks affects the market, effective measures will be taken to stop it.

In addition: Recently, the Central Bank has been working hard to tighten credit, and the banks and firms are generally short of funds.

### Overseas Chinese Supervisory Committee Member Kuang Yaopu Hopes to Improve Overseas Remittance Policy and Allow Overseas Chinese to Purchase and Transport Materials Back to the Country

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Kuang Yaopu, the only overseas Chinese supervisory committee member who returned to the country to attend the Supervisory Yuan meeting, made a speech, hoping that the government would revise a good method for overseas remittances and the transfer of overseas Chinese capital to the country. It is estimated that overseas remittances to China are about 200 million to 300 million US dollars per year. If there are appropriate policies and appropriate use, it will have a great effect on balancing China's international balance of payments. However, the current exchange rate of the Central Bank is almost twice as high as the black market, so almost all overseas remittances have escaped to Hong Kong.

On the one hand, our country is calling for the transfer of overseas Chinese capital to the country, but on the other hand, it does not allow overseas Chinese to purchase and transport materials for import with their original foreign exchange funds. The production of materials such as machinery and raw materials is also subject to various restrictions. In this way, even if overseas Chinese capital wants to be transferred to the country, there is no way to do so. Therefore, it is hoped that the Export and Import Management Committee will allow overseas Chinese to purchase and transport materials that are beneficial to China's construction with their accumulated wealth abroad for import. This move can encourage the transfer of overseas Chinese capital to the country, and it will definitely be of great help to the country's production and construction.

### Hong Kong Import and Export Statistics

### Savings Deposit Guarantee Fund for Banks and Bureaus to be Collected and Paid on a Monthly Basis

[Our Newspaper] National banks and bureaus once requested exemption from paying savings deposit guarantee reserve. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed the National Bank and the Four Joint Offices, rejecting the request, saying that they should still follow the regulations and adjust it once a month, allowing each bank and bureau to collect and pay it in total, and government bonds can be used to offset the payment.

In addition, the Central Bank previously approved the request of the local postal and remittance bureaus to be exempted from paying the savings deposit guarantee reserve through its branches and offices. The Ministry of Finance also replied by telegram, stating that the postal and remittance bureaus are also one of the national banks and bureaus, and the nature of deposits is also the same, so the guarantee reserve should also be deposited in the same way as other national banks and bureaus.

### Bustling Guest Merchants' Shopping and Trading, Cotton Yarn and Cloth are Both Bullish

In the cotton yarn market yesterday, trading was sluggish at first due to the approaching end of the six-bottom month and tight credit.

The markets for other coarse and fine yarns such as 40-count, 32-count, 20-count, and 16-count were also bullish.

### Production Areas Rise, People's Minds are Firm and High, Food Rice Prices Rise Again, Flour, Grain, Oil, and Cakes are All Hovering at High Prices

The rice market rose in the east, because prices in production areas such as Wuxi continued to rise, which made people's minds firm and high. In addition, due to rainy weather, the arrival of goods was reduced, and the owners took the opportunity to raise prices, and the market was revitalized. The price increase was stronger in the North City market, with white japonica reaching 145 million, an increase of 600,000 yuan. Thin rice rose by 700,000 to 143 million yuan.

The People's Mediation Committee released 6,000 dan of rice yesterday, but the price did not move. The arrival of goods in the two cities was 3415 dan.

The price of flour was firm early and then returned, and as a result, the prices of Lao Che and Bing Chuan slightly rose.

Corn trading was deserted, and the price was less affected. The North Gang of Yiyuan wheat was buying slowly and not in a hurry, and the arrival of sources was staggered, falling by 100,000.

### An Interlude in Changing to a National University: Three Students of Guanghua Voluntarily Withdraw; No Students Take the Final Exam at Daxia

[Our Newspaper News] Guanghua University announced yesterday that exams would begin on the 28th (next week). The university administration advised students to recognize that the exam and the movement to change to a national university are two separate matters, and that the movement to change to a national university does not necessarily require a strike as a condition. They hoped that the exams could be held as scheduled.

There was a minor disturbance among the students of the university yesterday. Xu Jieyi (female) and Zai Hao, and Cheng Wenjun were discovered to have mimeographed materials attacking the university's youth cafeteria and the fundraising movement for the committee to change to a national university, as well as other suspicious documents. They were handed over to the general assembly and the university authorities for handling. Later, their parents arrived and took them back. It is reported that the three have submitted proof from their parents that they are willing to voluntarily withdraw from the university.

Also: According to news from the student side, a letter from the representatives petitioning in Nanjing confirmed that the Ministry of Education had indeed issued two orders to Guanghua to change to National Jinyuan University, but both were rejected by the board of directors. However, Principal Zhu Jingnong told reporters last night that this was absolutely not the case, and if the Ministry of Education had indeed stated this to the students, the university would investigate and question the Ministry of Education.

[Our Newspaper News] Daxia University postponed the final exam date by three days to yesterday at the request of students demanding a change to a national university. The students originally requested a further postponement to Monday next week. The university administration, due to the lack of guarantees from the student leadership, still started the exams from yesterday. The security authorities, to prevent disturbances, dispatched over a hundred police officers to the university yesterday morning to maintain order. Some students sang songs around the examination hall, while others watched. By the afternoon, no students had entered the hall to take the exam, and there were no conflicts with the police. The university authorities issued a notice advising students to take the exam. If students still do not take the exam today, tomorrow, or even Monday next week, the university will be closed for vacation. The university has now telegraphed Principal Ou Yuanhuai, who is attending the Legislative Yuan meeting in Nanjing, to return to Shanghai to handle university affairs. The student representatives who are petitioning in Nanjing are still滞留 and have not returned.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 24th Dispatch] The Daxia University petition representatives went to the Ministry of Education again at 10 a.m. on the 24th to present four reasons for requesting the change to a national university to Vice Minister Hang Liwu. Hang replied that he was not opposed in principle to Daxia becoming a national university, but that the current financial situation was tight and it was definitely not possible. He would consider it in the future. The representatives have informed their classmates at the school of this situation by letter and requested instructions on future steps.

### Farewell to Readers

— Liang Junqing

Due to the need to cooperate with the suppression of the rebellion and national reconstruction, and to save paper, this medical journal has been decided to be suspended from July 1st, along with other weekly publications of this newspaper. This is truly a very regrettable thing!

For the past year or so, we have adhered to a principle: "To introduce the world's latest medicine to our readers in a simple and easy-to-understand way." Although we dare not say that we have achieved any success in fact, since the publication of this journal, we have received the support and encouragement of countless readers. We receive many letters from readers every day. This shows the enthusiasm of readers for this journal. We ask ourselves, how can we not strive and work harder! Therefore, we are also planning various plans to improve this journal in the future: such as writing short comments, simple introductions to world medicine, patient testimonials, and questions and answers from patient families, etc. We want to use a light and clear tone to describe them in neat and uniform short texts. In our hands, there are still several articles such as "The Latest Treatment for Typhoid Fever", "Causes and Treatment of Childhood Enuresis", "Causes and Treatment of Deforming Polyarthritis", and "The Latest Diagnostic Methods for Early Pulmonary Tuberculosis", etc. These are all very beneficial short articles for readers, but God is unwilling to fulfill people's wishes, and they can only not meet the readers with the suspension of this journal. Therefore, this is also a very regrettable thing!

Okay, let's not say it! Saying more only increases sadness. I hope that our country can be peaceful soon, and perhaps we can have a day when we can meet again in this newspaper, or other newspapers!

### Regarding the Side Effects of Bayer's Copper Preparation and its Usage Method

— Liang Junqing

However, because the toxicity of this copper preparation is very high, and injections often cause vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nephritis, etc., everyone is afraid to try it, so copper preparations are gradually being eliminated. Later, Ritter re-analyzed it chemically and then realized that copper preparations are not able to kill tuberculosis bacteria in the human body. On the contrary, if it is combined with a certain organism, then it will not only not harm people but can also stimulate the reticular endothelial cells in the human body, causing it to produce immune and antitoxic effects, which can gradually improve the disease and gradually recover. Ritter first published the details of his treatment of 30 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis with copper preparations, and the results were very satisfactory. This re-aroused the attention of many scholars. From 1940 to 1942, Arldr, Ritter, Manttarsch and others successively published papers praising the efficacy of copper preparations. Therefore, Bayer of Germany manufactured a copper preparation originally named Cuyrian, later renamed Ebesal (that is, Bayer's Copper Preparation), which has been used by countless doctors, and the results have been satisfactory. Previously, Dr. Fei Naxu, a German professor of internal medicine at National Tongji University, also published a paper detailing the efficacy of copper preparations in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Unfortunately, because it was during the period of occupation, everyone was indifferent. After the victory, because Germany failed, the pharmaceuticals of Bayer of Germany were sealed as enemy property, so no one cared about them and became unpopular. It is truly wronged!

The author has also used "Bayer's Copper Preparation" in more than ten cases, and the results, except for one case of acute pulmonary tuberculosis that did not work, have been very satisfactory in the rest. However, it also has various side effects, which must be noted: (1) There may be mild or high fever after injection; (2) The whole body may be very tired, or dizzy and headache; (3) If the number of injections is too close, then pharyngitis may occur, causing unbearable pain; (4) Sometimes nephritis may occur; (5) After copper is injected into the body, it is mostly stored in the liver and spleen, and then gradually excreted in the large intestine within two months. Therefore, if too much is injected, or the injection interval is too short, then it can cause toxic symptoms.

As for its method of use? I think the following points should be noted.

(1) Before use, the patient must be carefully examined, such as X-ray, examination of white blood cell classification and count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and tuberculosis bacteria in the sputum. It must be determined that it is initial or nodular tuberculosis before it can be used.

(2) The usage described on the package insert is unreliable. Each injection must be matched with the patient's physical condition so as not to cause accidents. It is best to use each dose at least twice. For example, use 0.01 twice before increasing to the second dose on the third time.

(3) The interval between each injection should not be too close, at least four days or seven or eight days apart, depending on the severity of the reaction and the condition of the body.

(4) If the total amount of injection reaches 0.8 or 7.2gm days, do not inject it again. It must be reused after resting for two months.

Regarding the advantages of Bayer's Copper Preparation, I can briefly add the following:

(1) In addition to the above-mentioned points that must be avoided, its scope of application is very wide.

(2) If air needle injection and surgery are not possible, it can replace them.

(3) Its price is very cheap, and poor patients can use it (it is expected that a total of three doses, about ten injections per dose, for a total of 30 injections, and the patient suffers very little from the pain of injecting 30 injections within 12 months.

(4) After the injection, the patient's appetite increases, the fever decreases, the cough decreases, and the sputum decreases, which is very beneficial to the patient's psychology.

The above is my honest view of "Bayer's Copper Preparation". As long as it is properly used by doctors, it is the most economical and proper special agent for pulmonary tuberculosis. (To be continued)

### Snake Venom Treats Epilepsy

— Cang Long

Everyone knows that epilepsy is a difficult disease to treat. A person who is working (or studying) suddenly stares blankly, foams at the mouth, and experiences stiff, twitching hands and feet. When the seizure is severe, they become completely unconscious and only return to normal after one or two hours. After such a "seizure," they are just like ordinary people, with no particular symptoms. But if you want to treat it then, it's practically impossible. You can give them bromides, herbal remedies, and medications like Luminal and Chloral, but besides slightly reducing the severity of the "seizure," there is practically nothing else you can do. However, if you ignore it and do nothing, the condition will worsen and become more frequent. If the patient has a seizure while going up or down stairs, getting on or off a car or train, or on a ferry, they could fall and die or drown. Therefore, when it comes to treating epilepsy, many doctors shake their heads in despair.

Since Dr. R. Sprangler of Philadelphia, USA, published a paper in 1929 on using snake venom to cure epilepsy, many scholars have followed suit. Many scholars in Europe and America have subsequently written articles praising its effectiveness. Dr. Fitz Simons of Germany even wrote a dedicated book discussing the benefits of snake venom in detail. It is said that many doctors in the United States are now using snake venom to treat epilepsy. According to the modern medical dictionary edited by Gutman in the United States in 1946, there are two types of snake venom: one with hemostatic properties and the other with analgesic and nerve-inhibiting properties (Neurotoxisch). This Neurotoxisch effect is now being used to treat epilepsy with great success. If the epilepsy is not caused by trauma, there is a good chance of recovery. Even if it is traumatic, it can significantly reduce the frequency of seizures to once every few months or once a year.

### New Medical Knowledge

— Cang Long

Pneumoperitoneum for Treating Intestinal Tuberculosis

This method has been tried in the United States with some success. According to a report in J. Med. Lyon. 1947, No. 28, Vachon and Feit have also experimented with it, and the results are very satisfactory and worth introducing. It is said that this method is relatively safe, with 800 cc of air injected into the abdominal cavity every two, four, or seven days. The 800 cc of air should be maintained in the abdominal cavity for four or five months (because the air in the abdominal cavity can be gradually absorbed by the peritoneum, reducing its volume, it must be replenished regularly). Patients feel that their condition improves after several air injections, with reduced diarrhea, abdominal distension, abdominal pain, and intestinal noises. Their appetite improves, their weight increases, and the tubercular lesions in their lungs also improve.

The Latest Treatment for Angina Pectoris

According to last year's British Medical Journal (P. 4532), A. A. Fitrgerald Peel used the "anticoagulant" drug Dicumarol to treat angina pectoris, with very good results. However, he said that it is not easy to see results with this drug alone. It must be used with intravenous injections of glucose solution and physiological saline, along with Cardophyllin or Euphyllin (using drip infusion) to be effective. This is because many angina patients often experience collapse during an angina attack and are difficult to save, so the above method must be used to treat the heart collapse effect at the same time to be effective.

### Preface to the Study of the Jiang Clan Genealogy of Wuling

— Jiang Zhongzheng

[Editor's Note: It has recently been discovered that President Jiang's ancestors descended from the Duke of Zhou. This newspaper has obtained an essay written by the President titled "Preface to the Study of the Jiang Clan Genealogy of Wuling," which was personally written by the President in calligraphy on Xuan paper and will be included in the Jiang family genealogy in Fenghua. We are honored to publish it first.]

The Zuo Zhuan states, "All Jiang, Xing, Mao, Zuo, and Ji clans are descendants of the Duke of Zhou." That our Jiang clan descended from the Duke of Zhou is believable and well-documented. However, the genealogies have been scattered and lost, and the ancestral lineage has been vaguely recorded, which I have always lamented. In November of the thirty-second year of the Republic [1943], during the commemoration of my late mother's 70th birthday, my eldest son, Jingguo, had someone secretly bring the clan genealogy from our hometown, which had been occupied by Japanese bandits, to Gan, and then finally to Chongqing. I repeatedly read it, almost forgetting sleep and food, and my thoughts of cherishing my late mother's kindness and repaying my roots grew stronger. The old genealogy lists the generations starting from Lord Yan Gong during the Five Dynasties period. Before that, it was said that they came from Tiantai, or that they used to live in Kuocang, but the details were unknown. Since returning to the capital after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, I have been collecting genealogies from Jiang clans in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, comparing and examining them, but still without any clues. The years are too distant, and the records have long been missing. Later, a clansman from Tianhe showed me an old handwritten copy of the Jiang clan genealogy of Nengshan, Longshan is in Ninghai, and does not belong to the Jiang clan system in Tiantai. I don't know how its genealogy entered Tiantai. The genealogy contains a branch of Lord Maha and Lord Jinzi, and it also records that Lord Jinzi and his descendants were buried in Sanling, Qin Xiao Township, Fenghua. I was overjoyed, but I regretted that the compilation was not strict and not done by a scholar. The recorded generations also had errors in entering side branches and reversing the order of time. As a single copy, I dared not believe it hastily. After a long time, I found the names of Lord Yan Gong and Lord Maha in the genealogies of the Jiang clan of Hengshan, Yin County, and the Jiang clan of Eyang, Juhua. Yan Gong's father's name was Xian, who once served as a Jianjian officer in Siming and was the first to move to Mingzhou. His grandfather's name was Da, and he had four or five brothers, all using this character as their name. Comparing it with the genealogies of the Jiang clans in Linhai, Huangyan, and Xianju, all have the names of these brothers, although the order may vary slightly. However, the compilation of these genealogies is superior and each version is consistent, so it should be more credible than the genealogy of Longshan. Therefore, I cross-referenced, detailed, and carefully verified, starting with Lord Yuanqing, the governor of Yanzhou in the Han Dynasty, and connecting with the old genealogy. There are thirty-three generations with a verifiable lineage, with a clear lineage and no errors after repeated verification, which is enough to comfort my lifelong ambition to trace my roots. Then, I further explored the traces of our ancestral home and migrations. Those with historical records to prove it: Zhou initially conferred the Jiang state, which later became Chu Qisi Township. In the Liu Song dynasty, it was renamed Lean, and in the Zhao Song dynasty, it was Xianju County, Guang Prefecture, which is now the territory of Gushi County, Henan. During the Han Dynasty, the descendants of the Jiang clan moved to Duling. In the fourth generation of Lord Yuanqing, Lord Shaoming, the Marquis of Mianting, moved to Yangxian. After passing through to Lord Boji, the prefect of Wu County in Jin, he moved to Taizhou. After another twenty generations, he moved to Mingzhou, which is roughly the situation. From Lord Yuanqing onwards, it has been more than a thousand years since the initial enfeoffment in the Zhou Dynasty. The genealogies of Yixing, Linhai, and Datian record in detail the generations and titles, thoroughly organized without omissions. However, there is no evidence in history, so I dare not agree blindly. I respectfully follow the example of attaching doubts and wait for future revisions. Alas! After the chaos of the Five Dynasties, the genealogies of noble families were lost. Ouyang Xiu compiled the "Table of Ancestral Lineages of Prime Ministers" for the Tang Dynasty and generally only traced back to the Liang, Chen, Wei, and Zhou dynasties. Our Jiang clan can still seek its ancestors and reach the Han Dynasty, with an unbroken lineage for two thousand years. How fortunate! The study of ethnicity is valued in our country. Although it has undergone several periods of turmoil and the old records are flawed, the origins can still be traced if we are careful in our research. This year, Wuzi [1948], our clan is revising the genealogy. We have specially hired Mr. Wu of Wujin as the director to take charge of the matter, and Mr. Chen of Cixi and Mr. Sha Wenruo of Yin County as compilers to assist in its completion. I have respectfully read the study of the ancestral lineage, which is clear in its logic and meticulously researched. I am delighted that it can reveal what previous generations have not and fulfill my long-held wishes, so I write this preface. The Book of Poetry says, "Rise early and retire late, do not disgrace those who gave birth to you." The Book of Documents says, "The millet and sorghum are not fragrant, but bright virtue is fragrant." May all descendants of the Jiang clan remember this! Eleventh day of June, thirty-seventh year of the Republic of China [1948], Zhou Tai, the 118th generation descendant of Siming, respectfully wrote and inscribed in Nanjing.

### Reminiscences of Sichuan Opera

— You Jin

Recently, it was reported that former Executive Yuan Premier Zhang Qun flew back to Chongqing from Beijing and indulged in his Sichuan opera addiction with Mayor Yang Sen and others. Mr. Zhang is from Sichuan, so he has a special fondness for Sichuan opera. Nostalgia is common to all, and of course, Mr. Zhang is no exception.

Although I am not from Sichuan, I have also listened to Sichuan opera in Sichuan Province. I remember the first time I listened to Sichuan opera was at a grand reception. After three rounds of drinks, the host's welcome speech and the guest's thank you speech were all delivered. Suddenly, a deafening sound of gongs and drums erupted from the adjacent courtyard, "Kuang, Kuang, Kuang," "Tang, Tang, Tang," almost shattering our eardrums.

Following the unsettling sound of gongs and drums was a shrill blast from a large trumpet. This is called "naotai," and the reason why Sichuan opera is also known as Gaoqiang (high-pitched) is probably because the tunes are extremely激越高亢high and loud. As for silk and bamboo instruments, strings, and clappers, they are all complete, like Qinqiang and Han songs. Sometimes, they are sad and melancholic; sometimes, they are crisp and refreshing, still retaining their artistic value.

That day, we heard Jia Peizhi's Laosheng, Chen Bixiu's Qingyi, and Xue Yanqiu's Huadan. The plays they sang included historical dramas such as Zhaojun Goes Beyond the Great Wall, Houchang Hui, Mei Nengzhen, Gongren Jing, and Farewell My Concubine. Although the stories are similar to Peking Opera, the lyrics are completely different. It is said that Jia Peizhi's reputation in Sichuan opera is equivalent to Ma Lianliang in Peking Opera, and Chen Bixiu is somewhat like Mei Lanfang. The Huadan Xue Yanqiu is a woman, and her reputation is equal to that of Xue Yancin in Peking Opera at the time.

There was a person named Tang Guangti, who had a position similar to Xiao Changhua in Peking Opera. He was very popular in Sichuan. Although he did not come to the performance that day, I still saw him in the theater later. His strength lay in playing jokes and saying lines. He was very fat and full of humor. Every word and action made the audience laugh.

In addition, there was an old Sichuan opera actor named Kang Zilin, who was a good man with a chivalrous heart. He was a martial artist with excellent fighting skills. Even when he was in his seventies, the audience insisted on him performing on stage. Although his martial arts skills were good, his physical strength was not enough. Once, during a particularly energetic performance, he fell on the stage, became ill after the performance, and died soon after! When he died, not only did the actors cry for him as if he were their parent, but almost everyone in society shed tears for him, showing the great power of his moving personality. Kang had many disciples, including many female disciples. When he was young, he often had the opportunity to contact women because he taught female disciples martial arts. Countless female disciples admired him, but Kang kept himself clean and did not get involved.

Regarding the compilation of Sichuan opera scripts, such as "Qin Tan," which is the most famous and widely circulated, the lyrics of the songs and lines are extremely elegant, written and revised by Zhao Xi (Yaosheng), a famous scholar in Sichuan. Almost everyone in Sichuan Province can sing a few lines, just like rickshaw drivers in Beijing can sing a few lines of "Visiting Mother in Palace." This is truly a top-notch folk art!

I wonder what kinds of plays Mr. Zhang Yuejun listened to? And what new famous actors are now performing on stage? Old Man Zilin is dead, Yaosheng is still there. Recalling the past, I wish I could go to Sichuan again and indulge in Sichuan opera!

### Wu Kezhai's Diary

— Qian Dacheng

I have always enjoyed reading diaries of famous people, especially those related to anecdotes. Yesterday, my friend Mr. Cao Jusheng showed me Wu Xianzai's "Diary of an Envoy to Jilin," a manuscript in red grid paper, with nine lines per half-page and varying numbers of words per line. The upper end of the block print has the six characters "Qingyun Xuan Ou Chao" (Casual Copy by Qingyun), with a total of thirty-five leaves and two blank leaves. There is a seal that says "Shi Jiangjun Yin Zhai" (Studio of the Ten Generals Seal). Shi Jiangjun Yin Zhai is the name of Kezhai's studio, located in Shuanglin Alley, Wu County, with the plaque written by Wang Yirong. This diary records from April 21st, Gengchen year of Tongzhi sixth year [1867] to December 19th. At that time, Kezhai, with the honorary title of a local official of the third rank, followed General Mingan of Jilin to handle border defense. The Draft History of Qing states: Xianzai traveled through key passes and learned that the land of Hunchun Heidingzi had long been occupied by Russian invasion. Therefore, he requested the Qing court to issue old boundary maps and schedule a protest with Russian officials, but the decree was not obtained. At that time, there was a man named Han Xiaozhong (Xiaozhong's original name was Bianwai, changed after pacification) who gathered 40,000 to 50,000 people in Jiapigou, Jilin, to resist the Qing army. Xianzai went alone to his camp, stayed overnight for two days, and Xiaozhong surrendered, and he was granted the fifth rank hat. The diary records this in great detail. On the day Kezhai entered the mountain to persuade surrender, he also changed into Manchu clothes, which was in late December. Mr. Qian Jibo once wrote an article recording this event. Mr. Gu Qiqian's compiled Kezhai's chronological biography does not mention this medical practice. Kezhai also has another diary called "Huanghua Jicheng," which is engraved in the "Yin Li Zai Si Tang Congshu" (Collection of the Yin Li Zai Si Tang). The "Northern Expedition Diary" is also a manuscript, which is collected by his great-grandson Mr. Hufan. Jusheng obtained this book from the descendants of his maternal uncle, Zeng Yucang. However, it is unknown from where Yucang obtained it. I will write a longer article to interpret it. Here I just write a few words to record my good fortune.

### Remembering Tan Yuanbo's Martyrdom in Stanley

— Lu Danlin

Tan Yuanbo of Nanhai (named Changxuan, great-grandson of Yusheng, grandson of Shuyu, Yi Hezi, son-in-law of Li Jipei), taught at St. Stephen's College in Hong Kong for nearly twenty years. He was honest and upright and trusted by all. In the winter of the 30th year of the Republic [1941], when the Japanese army attacked Hong Kong and landed in Stanley, Tan stayed in the school, refusing to evacuate, saying: "Protecting the school and the students is my responsibility." After everyone urged him, he sent his mother and wife away. When the Japanese soldiers entered the school and forcibly demanded the students upstairs, he argued with them. The Japanese soldiers were angry and stabbed him to death with spears. The next day, the old woman he employed and the school janitor buried him in the wilderness outside the school. In the spring of the 31st year of the Republic [1942], Li Jinan led people to pay their respects. The area was covered with weeds and smoke, with no monument or inscription, only a firewood mark inserted to record and identify the place. No one knows what he argued with the Japanese soldiers about that day, as no one was present at the time. Some say that the Japanese soldiers wanted to assault a female teacher, and he scolded them angrily, which led to his murder. After the war, the school publicly buried him on the school grounds and erected a monument in his memory. The inscription was written by Ye Xia'an (Gongchuo) and read: "In December 1941, Japan attacked Hong Kong. Stanley fell on the 24th, and the next day the invaders entered this school. At that time, Mr. Tan was staying behind and was killed for his refusal to submit. Earlier, when the enemy was approaching, the principal advised him to evacuate, but he sent his mother and wife away, and pledged to defend the school and protect the students, thus meeting his demise. Alas, since the founding of the school, many faculty and staff have contributed to the school, but only he alone has died in the line of duty. His name was Changxuan, courtesy name Yuanbo, from Nanhai, Guangdong. His family had a long history of scholarship and was respected by the times. He graduated from this school and entered the University of Hong Kong, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree. He served as a professor and head of Chinese studies at this school for nearly twenty years. His colleagues admired him, and the students respected and loved him. He is survived by his wife, Li Mo. He had no children. This school respects his daily conduct and his adherence to the right path to the end. There is no one like him at this time. A stone is erected on the school wall to perpetuate his glory and serve as a model for all. Erected with reverence by St. Stephen's College in 1947, written and inscribed by Ye Gongchuo of Panyu."

It is said that Xia'an and his family were close friends. Tan's courtesy name, Yuanbo, was given by Xia'an, hoping that he would become like Ji Yuanli and Fan Mengbo. Xia'an wrote a poem to commemorate Tan's martyrdom: "The green blood is cold on Stanley Hill, singing of dying for a long-held intention. His lone act ultimately moved people to record it, but who knows that his death is a national tragedy? I close my eyes, unable to bear to see the remaining ghosts, sacrificing one's life for the sake of righteousness is not against the norm. The stone of longing for her husband is old and far away, sadly recalling the moonlit corridors of the past." After Tan's martyrdom, his mother died missing her son, and his father died soon after, leaving only his wife. The family line was thus cut off. The ways of Heaven are difficult to know, and this is indeed cruel. When he was publicly buried, a painting of "Burying Jade in the Sea Mountain" was commissioned to solicit inscriptions and express condolences. I think that during the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, nearly ten million compatriots lost their lives. But there are very few like Tan, who resided overseas and worked diligently until death. Therefore, I specially record this.

### Remembering Jingning

— Yi Yun

Jingning is the most remote and impoverished county in Zhejiang, bordering Fujian Province (adjacent to Shouning County in Fujian). It used to belong to Chuzhou Prefecture, which was the most impoverished area in Zhejiang, and Jingning was the most impoverished county in Chuzhou. Ask people in Hangzhou, and most of them do not know where Jingning is, which shows how remote it is.

"Fish, dragon, chicken, phoenix, vegetables, lingzhi," is a poem that people used to write about Jingning, because the rivers are narrow and shallow, and the water is clear to the bottom. There are basically no fish a few inches long to be used as food, so the rarity of fish is equal to that of dragons. There are chickens, but not many, and their shape is special. They have tall legs and a thin body. When used as food, there is only skin, tendons, and bones, with very little meat. Because the land is barren and food is scarce, there are few insects, which causes them to be so thin. But the locals consider them precious and do not sell them easily. To find a slightly fatter chicken is as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, and impossible to find. Vegetables are difficult to grow due to the lack of water in the mountains. Things that are easily obtained elsewhere are very difficult to find in Jingning, equal to lingzhi. The locals mostly eat sweet potatoes and other things. The rice produced has a very bright red color on the outer layer. When cooked into rice, the red is like blood, which is frightening to look at. Even if the outer layer is completely washed off, the rice color is still very dull. Although it is more edible, the locals consider it a treasure, and it is no small sin to waste it. There are no rice shops in the entire city. To buy rice, one must negotiate with wealthy households who own fields. However, the largest landowner in the city only harvests a few tons of grain each year, which shows how little there is. There is also no place to buy pork. If a pig is slaughtered, they must beat a gong everywhere. People can buy meat when they hear the gong, otherwise there is none.

There is a special ethnic group in the area called Shemin. Most of the men live in the mountains and rarely interact with people. The women are employed by the locals to till and plant the land. They wear tight, pleated skirts with layers and layers, but no pants underneath. They wear silver rings as large as four inches in their ears and silver hairpins longer than a foot in their hair. They are very strong and work harder than ordinary people.

Jingning's local products are the best, with growing mushrooms being the most important. Every year in early winter, mushroom growers rent mountain land and buy all the trees on the land. They cut down the trees, remove the branches, and chop the trunks with axes. The ax-wielder must be an experienced mushroom grower, otherwise the depth of the axe cut will not be appropriate, and the mushrooms will not grow. After the trunk is chopped, it is placed on the ground, and all the branches and leaves are placed on top of it, and a wooden fence is built around the perimeter. If there is heavy snow that year, the mushroom harvest will be abundant the following year, otherwise it will be poor. The mushrooms all grow where the tree trunk has been chopped. The first year's harvest is limited, the second year's is abundant, and the third year's is the most abundant. Afterwards, it gradually decreases, and the growers abandon it and move on to other things. Mushroom growers are the largest merchants in Jingning. The area also produces tea leaves, which are as green as Longjing tea, but the leaves are thin and lack flavor, also due to the barren soil. During the Anti-Japanese War, many Zhejiang provincial agencies and people moved to the Lishui and Longquan areas. The adjacent Jingning also saw prosperity. I imagine that it is much more advanced today than it was in the past.

### 

In the past, when imperial censors impeached high-ranking officials, their memorials sometimes contained scolding and ridicule (such as An Weijun's impeachment of Li Hongzhang in the Jiawu year [1894]), but it was just excitement on paper, not direct insults that would make a person "dry saliva on their face." However, the members of the two houses of parliament in the early Republic era directly rebuked administrative officials to their faces! At that time, in addition to legislation, the parliament had various privileges such as impeachment, requests for investigation, and summoning administrative officials to attend and answer questions. During the ten years or so of the early Republic, I was a Beijing-based reporter for the Shi Bao and attended all the sessions of Congress, witnessing all sorts of scenes from the press box. When administrative officials were invited to the stage, the questioners below would often confront them aggressively, sometimes adding frivolous remarks, as if it were normal. Once, a high-ranking official was criticized so harshly by several members that he could hardly bear it. As he was about to leave the stage, he angrily said two things: (1) "Criticism is acceptable, but insults are not." (2) "I was also one of you sitting below." After he finished speaking, he left in a huff. Everyone below (the members' seats) and above (the press box) was stunned. His two sentences were concise and to the point, and worthy of reflection.

It turned out that this high-ranking official had also been a member of parliament two years earlier. Later, due to his political talent and activities, he obtained a high administrative position. This time, when he came to the parliament, he became the person on the stage (administrative officials had special seats on both sides of the stage). In the past, when he was below the stage, he was the "impeacher" of those on the stage. Today, being on the stage, he is now the "impeached," so he said, "I was also in the parliamentary seat." The meaning is to warn everyone present that unless you are a member of parliament for life, you will also have to experience this taste once you enter the government. The positions change, and it's only a matter of time. Leaving room for others now is leaving room for yourself in the future.

We reporters in the press box were "clear observers." Regarding the cyclical "confusion of those in authority," we only felt pity. What does it have to do with the country's politics, right and wrong, gain and loss? We can only learn from the Buddha and lament: "If you want to know the cause of your past life, look at what you are experiencing in this life. If you want to know the cause of your present life, look at what you will experience in your next life. Good, good!"
