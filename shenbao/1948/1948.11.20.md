### Victorious Counterattack by the National Army in Baoding; Communist Troops Completely Collapse Across the Board; Lin Biao's Forces Flee into the Pass, Gathering in Eastern Hebei to Brew a Major Battle

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 19th] The North China剿總 (Bandit Suppression Headquarters) reports: The Communist Seventh Column, which had been attacking Baoding, suffered a complete collapse on the night of the 18th. The National Army in Baoding launched a fierce counterattack on the southeastern and western passes at 11:00 PM on the 18th. The air force also flew in to assist in the battle. By midnight, the Eastern Gate Church, Dacaokan, the Southern Gate Flour Company, the Electric Light Company, and the Western Gate Train Station had been captured in succession. By dawn on the 19th, the southeastern and western passes had been completely recovered. The remnant bandits were scattered and fled in defeat. The National Army is currently engaged in mopping up operations.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 19th] A major battle is brewing in eastern Hebei. Remnant Communists are frequently on the move, reportedly having gathered seven columns. According to the Tianjin newspaper: The bulk of the bandit main force appears to be moving west towards Sanhe, Xianghe, and Pinggu. Large numbers of bandit troops have been spotted gathering at Yukou in northwestern Pinggu, Xiazhen Township in Sanhe County, and the city of Sanhe County. The bandit troops in the city of Sanhe County are even equipped with rapid units consisting of tanks and cavalry. Their aim seems to be to threaten traffic between Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin) and prevent the transport of supplies. To preempt their moves, the North China National Army is also moving large military formations towards eastern Hebei. Troop transport vehicles are rumbling along the Pingjin line, and National Army troops are massing at key stations along the line. A portion has already advanced east from Yangcun to search and suppress. A full-scale battle is imminent.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 19th] Yan Youwen, spokesperson for the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters, formally announced on the 19th: As of now, the units of Lin Biao that have entered the pass are the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 11th Columns, as well as a portion of the cavalry and artillery. There may be follow-up troops. Mr. Yan stated: The entry of the Lin bandits into the pass is a matter of common sense, but the time of their entry into the pass is slower than what the authorities estimated. According to a certain military authority, the National Army is determined to secure Ping, Jin, Tang, Tanggu New Port, and the Kailuan mining area and has made strong deployments.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 19th] The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters announced: At 7:00 AM on the 19th, about 400 roaming bandits were discovered near the eastern end of Beiyuan in northern Beiping. They engaged in fierce fighting with the People's Self-Defense Forces. By 8:00 AM, National Army reinforcements arrived to launch a painful counterattack, and the bandits, unable to withstand the assault, retreated north.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 19th] The councils of seven provinces and cities in North China jointly telegraphed the President earlier this month, requesting stabilization of the North China situation and strengthening of military and political power. They requested subsidies for the self-defense expenses and ammunition of the seven provinces and cities, enhancement of the air power in North China, handing over command to the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters, and allocating the military expenses of the Northeast to North China. The border region between Hebei, Rehe, and Liaoning should be placed under the unified command of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters. It is reported that the request has been discussed by the central government and largely approved. Gu Zhutong has telegraphed back to the councils of the seven provinces and cities, stating that all requests have been submitted by the President to the relevant departments for handling and will be decided after Minister He and Commander-in-Chief Fu have made overall plans. The central government has also made the decision to hand over the air force to the Bandit Suppression Headquarters for command and to assist in the North China operations for a long period of time.

### The Executive Yuan Will Hold an Extraordinary Meeting Today to Discuss the Issue of Extending the Circulation of Legal Tender; Xu Kan Returns to Nanjing to Report to Premier Weng on His Trip to Shanghai

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 19th] Minister of Finance Xu Kan flew back to Nanjing from Shanghai at 12:30 PM on the 19th. Mr. Xu immediately called on Premier Weng to report on his trip to Shanghai. In the afternoon, he went to the ministry to handle official business and immediately summoned Wu Xingzhou, the director of the Coinage Department, and others to discuss the issue of extending the deadline for the circulation of legal tender.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 19th] The deadline for the circulation of legal tender will expire on the 20th. Whether to prohibit circulation after the expiration or to extend the deadline again is an issue that the Ministry of Finance has recently received requests from various inland provinces to extend the deadline for the circulation of legal tender. The Sichuan Provincial Government also resolved at the provincial government meeting to request the central government to extend the deadline. The reasons are that prices in inland provinces are lower, and the current auxiliary currency is insufficient for application. If the circulation of legal tender is prohibited, prices will rise accordingly. After careful research, the Ministry of Finance also believes that the requests of the provinces are not without reason, and an extension is necessary. However, since this matter is of great importance, it will be submitted to the extraordinary administrative meeting on the 20th for decision.

### Truman's Reply to President Chiang: Allows Immediate Consideration of the China Problem; Newspaper Reports Wedemeyer Will Come to China Again with Mandate

[United Press Washington 19th Dispatch] President Truman returned to Washington from Key West on the 19th. He has replied to President Chiang's letter requesting more spiritual and material assistance from the United States, but the content of the reply is being kept strictly secret. It is generally believed that the President's reply may allow for immediate consideration of the China problem, but it did not offer any definite promises.

[United Press New York 18th Dispatch] Howard newspaper editorials on the 18th stated: The fate of all of China, even all of Asia, may depend on President Truman's reply to President Chiang's request to clarify the American attitude toward the situation in China. The newspaper stated: "This reply may also determine the final success or failure of Truman-Marshall foreign policy, beyond aid to Greece and Turkey." The newspaper continued with a questioning tone: "Why are we hesitant to provide the same assistance to our wartime ally, China? While we are holding the line in Europe, communist totalitarianism is expanding in a larger and richer Asia. China now immediately needs light weapons, ordnance, airplanes, and money to buy military supplies. They also need an American general, supported by an appropriate staff, to serve as an advisor to reorganize their supply and transportation systems. But more important than all, they need the American government to issue a statement that we will support them in saving their country against the Soviet Union's fifth column. China needs these facts now. If we must wait until Congress reconvenes to decide our attitude, then whatever action we take will be ineffective. If China fails, then the rest of Asia will be open to attack."

[Central News Agency Manchester, New Hampshire 18th United Press Dispatch] Republican Congressman Merrow declared here that the United States must immediately provide military assistance to China in order to prevent the communists from sweeping across the entire Asian continent. China should also be provided with overall military advice. He stated that the communist offensive against China must be stopped immediately, and that strategic discussions, debates, and investigations can be conducted after the crisis has passed. Merrow said, "When Congress convenes, I will propose a motion to create a consistent policy, stating that the communists must stop their aggression, or the United States will take strong countermeasures."

[Agence France-Presse Washington 19th Dispatch] According to a local newspaper, former Commander of the U.S. Forces in China, General Wedemeyer, will come to China with a special mission.

Editorial

### A Precious Period of Time! Political Reform and Increased U.S. Aid Should Proceed Simultaneously After the Great Victory in the Xuzhou Campaign

The Xuzhou Campaign is now nearing its end with a great victory for the National Army. This is truly something to be pleased about, and at the same time, it is even more worthy of our vigilance! What shall we do with this precious period of time?

The Xuzhou Campaign, a campaign lasting more than ten days, has been watched with great seriousness by the entire country, both the government and the public. Not only have the Chinese people been watching, but people all over the world have been watching. Fortunately, our leaders have commanded with great wisdom, and the soldiers at the front have fought bravely. Not only have the bandit troops to the east of Xuzhou collapsed and retreated northeast, but the bandit troops to the west of Xuzhou have also been routed. The National Army will soon join forces at Suxian, south of Xuzhou. Strictly speaking, the great battle of Xuzhou is already over. The bandit troops will not dare to covet Xubeng and the Huai River basin again in the short term. The morale of the people in the Huai River valley has been greatly boosted, and the heavy mood of the people throughout the country has been lightened. At the same time, American public opinion has also changed its tone regarding aid to China due to the Chinese government's arduous anti-communism: people who previously mistakenly believed that the Chinese Communist Party was merely a party advocating land reform have suddenly realized the international nature of the Chinese Communist Party; people who previously misunderstood that the Chinese government's suppression of bandits was merely a political struggle have fully understood that the suppression of bandits is entirely a war against aggression. Under the pressure of national public opinion, the American government has also repeatedly stated its policy toward China. Moreover, President Chiang has already telegraphed President Truman of the United States, firmly stating that China's anti-communist and bandit suppression efforts will never change, and appealing for increased U.S. aid. The U.S. President has also promised to consider this with sympathy. The overall situation in China and the Far East will have a turning point due to the great victory in the Xuzhou Campaign.

However, despite the improved overall situation, how we seize this opportunity for improvement, and how we strive to avoid missing this opportunity for a turn for the better, still depends on our awareness and struggle. Because, from our point of view, the great victory on the Xuzhou front can only alleviate the political momentum of the communist bandits for a time. Once the remnants of the communist bandits are reorganized, they may very well want to make a comeback. The troops they use will definitely increase, and the strategies they use will definitely be more ruthless than this time. If we cannot take advantage of the opportunity to make major political reforms after our military victory, and start anew with the people, refreshing the world's perception, then not only may the Xuzhou front still encounter the invasion of communist bandits, but the entire military future is still not entirely optimistic. Furthermore, even if we assume that the results of the discussions between President Truman, Secretary of Defense Forrestal, and Secretary of State Marshall decide to step up economic and military assistance to China, which can certainly boost the morale of the people and soldiers throughout the country, but if our country cannot carry out thorough political reforms, making the government a government that is 100% supported by all the people, and truly become a capable and efficient government, then whether or not we can transform U.S. aid materials into useful flesh and blood for ourselves, and ultimately reverse the situation, is still a serious question. Moreover, whether or not U.S. aid can actually be strengthened may still depend on a clear and decisive reform of China's political institutions and government talent first?

Therefore, the great victory on the Xuzhou front, which has stabilized the morale of the people in the Jianghuai River valley, is certainly worthy of our joy and celebration, and should especially inspire our people's respect and consolation for the soldiers at the front, but we must remember that "victory and defeat are common occurrences for soldiers," and even more so, we must not forget the famous saying "do not be arrogant in victory, and do not be discouraged in defeat." After the situation in Xuzhou is slightly stabilized after the great victory, we should, as yesterday's editorial in the Da Mei Evening News said, know that this kind of time won is extremely precious, and that it is even more important in political and economic terms than military terms. We should really reflect deeply and painfully, investigate the root causes of the failure of national affairs, and then prescribe a thorough remedy. Especially the Kuomintang, which is in power in the government, should accept the lessons of failure, make a firm determination, and seek its own path to reform for the sake of the party and the country. At this moment, the opportunity is urgent, and there is no time to delay. Once missed, it is gone. It is no longer enough to talk about reform; actual reform actions are needed.

Today, we must not shy away from seeking medical treatment. To be honest, in the past two or three years, the continuous setbacks in suppressing bandits have led to the current difficult situation. We must admit that we have made mistakes in political delays, and we have suffered from the corruption and incompetence of some officials. It must be known that politics, military affairs, and economics are three aspects of a unified whole, and they are mutually causal. Political consultation has weakened our fighting spirit; the elimination of officers and soldiers has dampened our morale. And both of these things have been influenced by American guidance. In other words, the reason why the communist bandits have grown strong is initially due to this. Therefore, no matter what the military situation is today, the first thing is to make a determination that there is no reason to have "peace talks" with the communist bandits again. Compromise is surrender, and surrender is national destruction! All officials and people, from top to bottom, should be thoroughly enlightened that one step back is a dead end, a path to destruction. Only when soldiers fight desperately and the people contribute their wealth to help the war effort will there be a way out for us and a way out for the country. All defeatists and wavering elements should be thoroughly purged first! If the government wants to reform, it should start with these things first.

Secondly, political reform must recognize a major premise: that the foundation of the government must be built on the interests of the people, that is, the government is composed of outstanding people united together, and is a government that seeks the interests of the general public. As Mr. Chen Bulei said in his will: "The central leadership of our country has not made any mistakes in its policies in the past twenty years." But we must go a step further and broadly recruit truly talented people in society who have careers, ambitions, abilities, and insights to enrich the government's ranks, improve government policies, and inspire every good citizen to actively participate in this unprecedented anti-communist war, to participate in this national war that opposes totalitarian aggression and is related to the national destiny and the people's lives, then the government will have vitality, politics will have hope, and then the assistance of American allies will come naturally without being sought, and will be strengthened without being asked to be strengthened.

At the same time, we also share the same view as the Da Mei Evening News that the precious period of time after the great victory in the Xuzhou Campaign should also be valued in distant Washington, just as in China. All those who can do something should make good use of it. China should use this time to make thorough reforms; the United States should use this time to quickly strengthen aid to China, so that the aggressive forces of communism cannot spread to China or to Asia!

### Rear Tibet Representatives Call on Xu Shiying: Inquire About Welcoming the Panchen Lama Back to Tibet; Will Pay Respects to the President in the Coming Days

[Central News Agency Nanking 19th Dispatch] Wang Luojie Suoduo Beier Guanbao, Luosang Jing'er, and other representatives from Rear Tibet flew to Nanjing from Lanzhou on the 15th. They called on Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, on the 17th to inquire about the matter of welcoming the 10th Panchen Lama Luosang Quji Jianzan back to Tibet to administer the government. They will also pay respects to the President in the coming days, representing the people of Rear Tibet. According to reports, the 10th Panchen was born in 1938. After being discovered in Qinghai, he was taken to Ta'er Monastery in Qinghai to take the throne and receive teachings from eminent monks and teachers. The Panchen studied diligently and had a remarkable nature. The Tibetan people loved him very much. In recent years, representatives have been sent to Qinghai many times to welcome him back to Tibet, but due to the passing of the 9th Panchen and the discovery of three spiritual children simultaneously after the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen, although the other two spiritual children have passed away one after another, the true body of the 10th Panchen has not yet been determined. The Tibetan people believe that Luosang Quji Jianzan is still young and studying scriptures, and that Qinghai Ta'er Monastery is the birthplace of the Yellow Sect, which is very suitable for studying scriptures, so the matter of entering Tibet has not yet been decided. This time, Wang Luojie and others came to the capital to ask the central government for instructions on welcoming him back to Tibet. Whether the 10th Panchen will immediately return to Tibet to administer the government will be completely determined by the central government. Given the current transportation situation, it seems impossible in the short term, and the true body of the 10th Panchen Lama still needs to be determined by the central government.

No Division of Boundaries Allowed Before Demarcation

### Internal Situation in Tibet Very Peaceful

Spokesperson of the Resident Office in Nanking Speaks

[Central News Agency Nanking 19th Dispatch] According to the spokesperson of the Tibetan Resident Office in Nanking, Tibet is customarily divided into Front Tibet and Rear Tibet, which are administered by the Dalai and Panchen Lamas respectively. However, since the Republic of China, although there is still a division between Front and Rear Tibet in religious terms, politically they are completely unified. There is only the Tibetan government, which handles all Tibetan affairs in Lhasa, and there is no such thing as separate Front and Rear governments. The report that Wang Luojie, Secretary General of the Rear Tibetan government, came to the capital is probably a misunderstanding of the Rear Tibet delegation welcoming the Panchen back to Tibet. Since the passing of the 13th Dalai Lama and the 9th Panchen Lama, the internal situation in Tibet has been very harmonious, and the relationship with the central government has become even closer. There is much misunderstanding about Tibetan affairs in the outside world, and these two rumors are not true. The internal situation in Tibet is currently very peaceful.

### UN Assembly Debates Disarmament Issue, US and Soviet Representatives Engage in Verbal Warfare, Soviet Proposal May Be Rejected by the Assembly

[Our Newspaper] Paris, 19th, Broadcast: The United Nations General Assembly continued this afternoon, debating the disarmament issue. The Soviet Union's proposal to reduce the military strength of the five major powers by one-third may be rejected by the Assembly.

[United Press, Paris, 19th] US Chief Representative Dulles spoke at the plenary meeting of the UN General Assembly today, denouncing the Soviet Union's proposal to reduce the military strength of the five major powers by one-third, and calling on the Assembly to further study disarmament steps. Dulles said: The Soviet Union takes the disarmament issue too lightly and is almost irresponsible. This is a cruel deception, wanting to make people believe that peace can be hastily promoted. The five countries mentioned by the Soviet Union are not the only countries with large military equipment, and the military status of the five countries is not equal. The current US military is only 12% of the wartime level, while the Soviet Union's military can reach 35% to 55% of the wartime level. Soviet Representative Vyshinsky immediately replied: The US and Britain are conducting a crazy arms race against the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's request for the five major powers to reduce their military strength by one-third and ban atomic bombs is due to this arms race.

[Associated Press, Paris, 19th] Dulles said at the UN General Assembly: The Chinese government only has a small amount of military equipment and is fighting a life-and-death battle with the Chinese Communists. If the Assembly recommends that China reduce its military by one-third, the Chinese Communist army will not be under the jurisdiction of the United Nations. This is tantamount to urging the Chinese government to surrender to the well-equipped Communists. France was once under German occupation, so it had almost no military equipment. Its current military strength is not enough to assume the responsibilities recognized by the United Nations Charter. Dulles said: The United States was actively disarming, and now it is slightly rebuilding its military equipment to balance the countries surrounding Western Europe. He said: "We hope to use this to fill the vacuum left by the war in Western Europe with local forces rather than foreign forces."

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] The representatives of the major powers at the UN General Assembly on the night of the 18th were extremely active. They suggested that the Standing Armaments Committee of the Security Council should continue its disarmament work. Philippine Representative Romulo, in attacking the Soviet Union's proposal to reduce its military strength by one-third, said that the Soviet Union's proposal could not be realized because the Western powers had reduced their military strength below the limit and must reorganize their military equipment to confront the Soviet Union, which maintains its wartime strength. He called on all member states to do their best to dispel the secrets and rumors about military equipment, as this is an important first step in control.

### Security Council Requests Troop Withdrawal Order, Israel Responds and Accepts, and Expresses Willingness to Hold Peace Talks with Arabs

[Associated Press, Paris, 19th] The United Nations announced today that Israel has complied with the Security Council's order to withdraw some troops from the Negev area and is preparing to negotiate a truce treaty with the Arabs on Palestine. Acting Mediator Bunche announced that he had received a reply from the Israeli government expressing its willingness to comply with some Security Council instructions.

The Security Council set the 19th as the final day for Israel to abandon the newly occupied land in the south. Bunche told reporters that the Israeli reply was satisfactory. He said that the Jews and Egypt have accepted the principle of withdrawing from the Negev area. A telegram from Tel Aviv stated that Israel has decided to station more than 20 guards in the Negev. The Security Council instructed the Arab and Jewish parties on Tuesday to negotiate a complete truce treaty in Palestine. Israel welcomed this and asked Bunche to inform them of the time and place of the truce negotiations as soon as possible. The Arab countries have not yet responded to this order, but their representatives to the UN General Assembly have repeatedly expressed their willingness to negotiate with the Jews.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 19th] United Nations Acting Mediator Bunche sent letters to the governments of seven Arab countries and Israel tonight, asking them to submit individual opinions on the procedures for the truce negotiations to be carried out in accordance with the Security Council resolution. The letter also stated that the Security Council's resolution requires the countries concerned to put forward their specific wishes for peace.

### United Nations General Assembly Passes Reports of Various Committees

Up to now, the United States has borne more than one-third of the United Nations' expenses. The General Assembly unanimously passed the Secretary-General's report on the construction of permanent headquarters in New York.

The General Assembly also passed, by a vote of 21 to 11 with 12 abstentions, that the powers of the League of Nations stipulated in the 1928 economic agreement should be transferred to the United Nations organization. Since Franco's Spain was also one of the signatories of the 1928 agreement, this issue caused fierce debate in the Legal Committee.

### Truman and Forrestal Discuss General Issues, Not Involving the Situation in China

### Tojo Will Submit an Appeal to MacArthur, Defending Japan's Aggression, Acknowledging Himself as a Leader of the Defeated Country and Not Asking for Forgiveness

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 19th] Tojo, the mastermind of Japan's 25 war criminals, seems to have decided to die as a "Japanese hero" who defends Japan's aggressive actions over the past 20 years. In Tojo's future appeal to MacArthur, he will not ask for a review of the severity of the sentence, but will again strongly argue that Japan defended itself in response to the challenge of Western countries. Tojo's appeal is obviously aimed at propaganda and has no other purpose. Tojo will say that he does not seek forgiveness, but only wishes to show that Japan is wronged in being called an aggressor by various countries.

Tojo will emphasize Japan's right to engage in self-defense wars, which the Allied countries considered aggressive wars, but which were definitely not crimes. According to Tojo's defense lawyer, Tojo's attitude in prison is calm, and he is deeply indignant at the Allied countries' unfairness to Japan. Tojo believes that the trial was fairly conducted, but in the end, it was the victorious countries trying the defeated countries. As one of the leaders of the defeated countries, he has no other expectations except death.

Waves of Labor Disputes Surge; Many Factories Strike. [Special Dispatch] Waves of labor disputes are surging. The Social Bureau has reported that it has sent personnel to mediate in the following cases: (1) Workers at the Great China Match Company and Xiechang Match Factory went on strike yesterday over the issue of rice subsidies. (2) Workers at two towel weaving factories, Minguang and others, went on strike yesterday over the issue of wages. (3) At the Litai Rubber Factory (i.e., Zhengtai No. 2 Factory), the entire workforce went on strike after the dismissal of Shen Shizhou and Yuan Keming due to worker meal issues. (4) Workers at the Xinhe Yarn Factory surrounded the factory management the night before, demanding a subsidy of one dou of rice. They resumed work after persuasion from the Social Bureau.

[Special Dispatch] Employees of over 20 underwear factories, including Kangpai Si, Weixin, Huafu, and Fuhua, went on strike yesterday one after another over wage issues. The Social Bureau convened labor and management for negotiations in the afternoon, during which disturbances occurred. Workers at the Xinguang Underwear Factory were not involved in the turmoil due to the separate organization of the industry union. The basic wage for underwear industry employees before August 19th was originally 2.65 yuan in legal tender, which was issued according to the upper period index. Now, after changing to the gold yuan currency to calculate the basic wage, the workers demanded a conversion to 3.21 yuan in gold yuan, which the employer did not agree to. This dispute is being submitted to the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee for arbitration. At 4:00 p.m. yesterday, Shen Ding, Director of the Third Section of the Social Bureau, convened representatives from labor and management to mediate. After both parties agreed to temporarily calculate based on 3 yuan in gold yuan, any overpayment or underpayment will be adjusted after the arbitration committee's ruling. Representatives from labor and management who participated in the negotiations achieved satisfactory results. When exiting the Labor Office, over one hundred members of the underwear industry union who were gathered in the square were unaware of the situation and suddenly swarmed forward, with a few even attacking the employer representatives. Li Guangchi, Managing Director of Huanqiu Underwear Weaving Factory and Standing Director of the Underwear Industry Association, had his glasses smashed on the spot, and his right cheek and nose were scratched and bleeding. The situation became chaotic, and the representatives quickly retreated into the Labor Office. Director Shen and union representatives stepped forward to stop the workers' reckless actions. The police officers stationed at the Bureau urgently telegraphed the police station to send police to suppress the situation and closed the main gate, prohibiting entry and exit. Director Shen was very angry at the workers' unreasonable behavior of openly committing violence at the Bureau and reported the incident to Director Wu, requesting that the beaten Li Guangchi identify the attackers so that they could be sent to the police station for legal action. However, due to the crowdedness at the time, it was impossible to identify the perpetrators. After consultation between the union representatives and Li, it was decided that in addition to the union publishing an apology in the newspaper and compensating for the losses, all union members present would line up and bow to Li to express their apologies. Director Shen also lectured the workers, pointing out that such barbaric actions would be detrimental to all workers in the industry and hoping they could exercise self-restraint. The iron gate was opened at around 6:00 p.m., allowing the workers to return home. Mayor Wu Leads Public Memorial for Chen Bulei; Cannons Fired and Mournful Music Played; Solemn Atmosphere at the North Railway Station; Coffin Transported to Hangzhou by Special Train Yesterday. [Special Dispatch] The special train carrying the coffin of the late Central Committee Member and National Policy Advisor to the Presidential Office, Chen Bulei, arrived at the North Railway Station from Nanjing at 9:00 p.m. the night before. At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, people from all walks of life in the city held a public memorial service at Platform No. 3 of the North Railway Station. Key figures from the Party, government, and military, as well as celebrities from all walks of life, including Wu Guozhen, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Xuan Tiewu, Chen Qicai, He Yaozu, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Shuping, Wu Kaixian, Zhao Zukang, Zhu Ping, Cheng Cangbo, Feng Youzhen, Xu Jiqing, and Xu Xueyu, totaling several hundred people, attended. Chen's coffin was placed in the second carriage, with a memorial altar inside, adorned with a portrait and surrounded by cypress branches and white flowers. The carriage displayed a mourning banner from the President reading "A Perfect Man of Our Time" and a mourning couplet from the Municipal Party Headquarters reading "A Model to Be Admired." Next to the carriage was a giant writing brush over ten feet long, offered by Chen's nephew, Weng Zeyong, inscribed with the mourning words: "May everyone pick up the pen they have put down and continue to work for the happiness of the motherland and world peace." Several carriages behind the special train were posted with paper slogans such as "Chen Bulei's Spirit Lives On" and "In Memory of Chen, Emulate Chen's Spirit of Loyalty to the Nation." The platform was filled with wreaths sent by various agencies and organizations. A sacrificial table was set up in front of the hearse, with offerings of fruits and pastries, silver candles burning brightly, and incense smoke lingering, creating a grand and solemn atmosphere. The public memorial began at around 9:00 a.m., presided over by Mayor Wu, with Speaker Pan, Director Fang, Commander Xuan, Chen Qicai, He Yaozu, Wang Xiaolai, and Xu Jiqing accompanying the ceremony. After the firing of cannons, the Garrison Command and Police Bureau band played mournful music. The mayor, with a sorrowful expression, offered wine, flowers, and incense amidst the mournful music. Yao Shaolu then recited the eulogy. Everyone bowed three times to the portrait, and the music played to conclude the ceremony. Chen's wife, sons Mai and Sui, daughters Xiu and Lian, and family members including younger brothers Xunci, Xuyu, and Xunyuan, returned the bow in front of the coffin. After the ceremony, the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Two-Road Party Headquarters held public memorials, presided over by Fang Zhi and Li Dasan; the Journalists Association, the Newspaper Association, Shen Bao, and Xinwen Bao colleagues held a public memorial, presided over by Cheng Cangbo. Subsequently, the Board of Directors of the Four Ming Bank, colleagues from the Wuhe Weaving Factory, the Alumni Association of Zhejiang University, and the Agricultural Bank of China successively offered their condolences. At exactly 10:00 a.m., the hearse slowly departed for Hangzhou amidst mournful music. Labor-Management Disputes in Cinemas Escalate; All Ticket Sellers and Ushers Respond; Social Bureau Schedules Mediation Today. [Special Dispatch] The dispute was triggered by the refusal of cinema owners to meet the six demands for improved treatment put forward by cinema employees the night before, resulting in a strike. Labor and management negotiated all day yesterday without reaching a resolution, and all cinemas were closed for a day. The original demands were made by the First Branch of the industry, which consisted of projectionists in the projection rooms of each cinema. Yesterday, however, employees of the Second Branch of the industry, including all ticket sellers and ushers, also responded to the demands of the First Branch, escalating the situation. After a meeting yesterday, all cinema owners believed that the employees should resume work immediately before negotiations could begin, otherwise, no demands would be considered. Regarding the issue of the Second Branch, they stated that it should be discussed after the issue of the First Branch was resolved. As it is unlikely that labor and management will reach a consensus, the only hope for resolving the dispute lies in the Social Bureau's mediation today. Judging from the situation, it is feared that cinemas in the city will not be able to resume screenings for the next two days. Relief Donations to be Paid Before the End of the Month; Calculated at the Old Exchange Rate. [Special Dispatch] The Shanghai District Relief Special Donation Fundraising Committee is levying special relief donations based on the total amount of foreign exchange purchased for import by various manufacturers. Since the government officially changed the exchange rate between gold notes and foreign currencies, the calculation should have been made according to the new exchange rate. However, to take into account the burden on various manufacturers, those who pay before the end of this month will still be charged according to the old exchange rate. Manufacturers that have settled foreign exchange are urged to quickly take the committee's collection note to the Municipal Bank on Jiujiang Road for payment.

Yesterday afternoon, Social Bureau Director Wu invited Lu Guixiang, Director of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, and Shui Qunyun, Chairman of the General Labor Union, to discuss technical issues related to the distribution. According to Director Wu, factories with employee consumer cooperatives will be responsible for the distribution as much as possible. For factories without cooperative organizations, the labor union will designate rice, oil, sugar, and coal briquette stores near the factory as special distribution outlets, but the labor union must report the exact number. For mobile occupational workers, the Civil Food Allocation Committee will cooperate with the General Labor Union to designate civic consumer cooperatives or special business outlets throughout the city for distribution. Director Wu also stated that the allocated price of oil, sugar, and coal briquettes has been determined to be two-thirds of the market price, and the allocated price of rice will be determined after negotiations with the United States. All Circles Xubeng Comfort Group; Departing on the 22nd. The Xubeng Comfort Group from all walks of life is scheduled to depart on the 22nd.

[Special Dispatch] At around 10:30 a.m. yesterday, at the bridge pier on Xizang Road, Guangfu Road, Zhabei, stevedores from the Hubei gang and the Jiangbei gang engaged in a gang fight over business at the Fourth Bank Warehouse Wharf. Both sides gathered two to three hundred people, using iron rods and sticks to fight each other. The Hubei gang was eventually defeated and retreated into the warehouse, closing the iron gate. At this time, the Jiangbei gang took the opportunity to rush to the gate, stabbing into the gap with sharp knives, hitting Ma Xiaochun of the Hubei gang in the abdomen. Seeing this, the Hubei gang opened the iron gate and charged out again, lasting for over half an hour. As a result, six people from the Hubei gang were killed or injured.

Municipal Teachers' Meeting; Mayor Persuades to Cancel Leave; Hopes to Resume Teaching Next Monday; Rice Allocation for Next Month Allowed to be Released Early. [Special Dispatch] The Municipal Middle School Teachers' Association held a board of directors and representatives meeting at Gezhi Middle School yesterday afternoon. Mayor Wu attended to persuade them, stating that he was indeed doing his best to improve their treatment and was not shirking responsibility. The municipal government needs to wait until the sealed materials are sold before it has money, which cannot be obtained in a day or two. Worsted wool has begun to be distributed, and others are still pending. He still hoped that all teachers would take the overall situation into consideration. He asked to cancel their leave and resume teaching in his personal capacity, not as mayor. The teachers then raised several requests: (1) The rice allocation for December should be issued in advance. (2) Strive to restore the rice allocation to eight dou from the central government. (3) Adjust the treatment as soon as possible. (4) If the Legislative Yuan's plan to improve the treatment of civil servants and teachers is implemented, the differential should be issued as soon as possible. (5) Distribute serge. (6) Allow the organization of a teachers' welfare committee. Mayor Wu replied that he would try to issue the December rice allocation early and would forward the request to restore the rice allocation of eight dou and improve treatment to the central government. Regarding teacher welfare, all benefits enjoyed by municipal government employees can be enjoyed equally. He hoped that they could cancel their leave and resume teaching on Monday.

[Special Dispatch] Regarding the High Court's order to release prisoners serving sentences of less than five years and the Ministry of Justice's ongoing plan to broadly release prisoners, reporters inquired with the city's police authorities. They stated: "This move gives criminals a path to reform, and this bureau expresses its deep sympathy. However, unrestricted release will have a significant impact on local security, especially during this winter prevention period, which will likely increase the burden on security authorities. If the judicial authorities release criminals due to a lack of prison rations, other avenues should be sought to resolve the issue. Otherwise, criminals will be unduly pardoned, which will inevitably increase their chances of re-offending, and those who have not committed crimes will also become unscrupulous and do evil." Second Batch of New Recruits; Conscription Begins Early Next Month. [Special Dispatch] The city's conscription of the second batch of new recruits for this year, and the filling of the 1,000 vacancies from the first batch, will begin in early December. In addition to the quota of 7,000 for the first and second batches, 4,000 recruits will also be pre-conscripted for the 38th year, for a total of 11,000 recruits. The conscription method will still be a combination of lottery and voluntary enlistment. After conscription, conscripted young men in each district will be assigned to the garrison brigade for organization and training. The city's military service association believes that the family settlement fees required for this batch of new recruits will be very high. It fears that the family settlement fees levied from entertainment venues will be insufficient, so it will consult with the municipal government and other relevant parties to find other ways to increase revenue.

[Special Dispatch] The number of prisoners in Shanghai Prison has reached more than 5,200. Warden Kong Xianglin described this as a large family of more than 5,000 people, and the most difficult issue is the unresolved problem of prison rations. Approximately 30 dan of rice are needed per day, and the stipulated purchase price is 25 yuan per dan, making it extremely difficult to purchase at this time of high rice prices. Foreign prisoners need bread, two loaves per person per day, costing approximately 13 yuan, so the monthly bread expense per person is 390 yuan. Kong smiled wryly and said: "This amount is more than my monthly salary, but foreign prisoners are still not satisfied, either complaining that the bread is not good or criticizing the lack of beef in the dishes. They don't know how much effort the prison authorities have put in." He then discussed the treatment of prison staff. He said that senior staff earn one to two hundred yuan per month, while guards earn only forty to fifty yuan, and the work in the prison is繁剧 and they cannot easily take leave. Even the opportunity to queue up to buy things has to be given up. He hoped that there would be a reasonable adjustment to this. Twenty Prisoners Paroled. Twenty parolees were approved by the Ministry of Justice yesterday and were released in the afternoon. Warden Kong also held a simple but solemn parole ceremony for each prisoner before leaving the prison, encouraging them to reform. Today's Games.

Import and Export Linkage System; Decision in Principle to Adopt; Relevant Units Discuss Implementation Details Yesterday. [Special Dispatch] According to sources from the Import and Export Control Commission, a decision in principle has been made to adopt the import and export linkage system. Relevant units held discussions yesterday morning on the implementation details. It is reported that after the implementation of the linkage system, the foreign exchange of manufacturers and importers will be directly obtained from exporters, and the government will no longer provide it. Imports will still be restricted, and the types and quantities of imported materials will be specified based on domestic needs. In addition, the import quotas for the Import and Export Control Commission's 7th and 8th seasons have now been fully allocated. Furthermore: The public is very concerned about the implementation of the import and export linkage system. According to reliable sources, the main points of the method are that the foreign exchange obtained by exporters from the export of goods, although 100% will be sold to the Central Bank and exchanged for gold yuan at the official price, must still be deposited in foreign currency with the Central Bank or a designated bank. Then, the designated bank will sell it on behalf of the exporters at the current market price of the foreign currency. The person who purchases this foreign currency must be a formal importer, and it can only be used to import materials approved by the government. This method still uses the spirit of the previous foreign exchange settlement certificate, but there are slight changes in name and content. It is also learned that the selling price of this export foreign currency may be above 30 gold yuan per US dollar. Rice Market Falls Sharply. Rice prices continued to trend downward yesterday. The market arrived in large quantities, totaling 5,018 shi in both the north and south markets. The rice allocated for distribution in the city in October has been distributed throughout the city since yesterday. Yesterday, the rice market situation showed another sharp decline. Each vendor was seen retreating to the sixth pass in the morning, and only occasional transactions took place on this street. Japonica rice was quoted at 5780 yuan, but later, due to abundant supply and low demand, it fell by another 340 yuan. By the time the market closed, the south market had become firmer, and white japonica rice ended at 580 yuan, resulting in a drop of about 450 yuan. The north market was 550 yuan, thin japonica rice was 590 yuan in the south market and 550 yuan in the north market, and medium-grade xiang rice was 500 yuan in the south market and high-grade rice was 500 yuan in the north market, with inconsistencies between the north and south. Yesterday, individual carriers sold rice along the street for 500 yuan. The general public also adopted a wait-and-see attitude due to the drop in rice prices, and there was little off-market trading. Prices were all below the market quotations. The price of flour weakened, with old car flour at 150 yuan and battleship flour at 146 yuan. Vegetable oil was sluggish in sales, soybean oil was priced at 820 yuan, raw oil was 1,100 yuan, sesame oil was 900 yuan, and rapeseed oil was 680 yuan. Yarn and Cloth Market Was Flat and Weak. Yesterday's yarn market. Off-market trading turned sluggish, customers' appetites were blocked, sellers kept throwing sales, people's hearts trended weak, and the market atmosphere suddenly became stagnant. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was initially quoted at still standing outside the 10,000 yuan mark. Subsequently, due to more sales than purchases, the price gradually fell to 9,600 yuan at the close, a drop of 600 yuan compared to the previous day. 42-count double-strand Jincheng and 40-count yarn also fell by 4500 yuan, and 32-count Yinyue yarn had more sales, with a price drop of 700 yuan. 21-count Shuangma yarn was last traded at 6,800 yuan, a drop of 500 yuan. Other coarse yarns such as 20-count Jincheng Tiannv, 16-count Guangming, and 10-count Tongzijun Jiahe also fell by varying amounts from 3400 yuan to 600 yuan. Due to the resumption of allocation of the Textile Construction Company to designated households, the supply of cotton cloth was abundant, and people's hearts turned stable. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was in short supply on the market, and although the north road was blocked, shops along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line came to Shanghai for procurement in large quantities. Ningbo, Hangzhou, and other ports also had sales. The initial quote was still firm, once rising to 355 yuan, which was 5 yuan higher than the previous close. Later, due to retail investors selling high, actual sales on this street were not smooth, transactions were sparse, and the market fell back to 345 yuan at the close, a decrease of 5 yuan compared to the previous day. Yuan Bijie of the Four Gentlemen had an allocation from the Textile Construction Company, so it fell slightly to 330 yuan. Some people sold it, and the result rose back to 40 yuan, which was the same as the previous day's close. Silk and Satin Continued to Trend Downward. Artificial silk was being sold by the China Trust Bureau

### Index Too Low, Demanding Remedy: General Labor Union Files Four-Point Petition Yesterday, Mayor Expresses Agreement in Principle

[Our Newspaper's Report] Various industry labor unions in this city believe that the cost of living index for the first half of November, as announced by the authorities, is too low, and have petitioned the General Labor Union one after another, requesting that it forward a request to the authorities to quickly seek a remedy. The General Labor Union then convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors the day before yesterday afternoon. Yesterday morning, Shui Xiangyun, Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xianggao, and all the other standing directors went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. Because Director Wu was attending a municipal meeting at the city government, the representatives, after explaining their intentions to Deputy Director Zhao, went to the city government to petition, putting forward four demands. Mayor Wu and Director Wu received them and expressed that they were quite aware of the difficult living conditions of the workers, but it was also true that the employers could not afford it. In this difficult situation, they hoped to overcome the difficulties together in the spirit of labor-management cooperation. The replies to the proposed requests are as follows: (1) Regarding the elimination of the progressive discount, agreement in principle. However, the progressive discount is a central government regulation and will be submitted to the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee for discussion and decision before being reported to the central government. (2) Regarding the calculation of wages for industrial workers based on the current cost of living index, acceptance in principle, to be submitted to the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee. In fact, this month, because the October index was not announced, many have already been paid according to the current index. (3) Because the index for the first half of November is too low, during the second half of the month, they may negotiate with the employers to borrow half of the wages for the first half of November. Sympathy in principle; if workers are indeed experiencing financial difficulties, they may negotiate with the employers to borrow the wages for the second half of November, but the total amount shall not exceed one-half of the wages for the first half of November. (4) After the index at the end of November is announced, from November 1st to the 30th, all settlements should be based on the index at the end of the month, to be handed over to the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee to form a group for research.
