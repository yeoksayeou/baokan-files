[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] To gain the people's trust in the Gold Yuan, the government has revised the Gold Yuan issuance measures and the measures for handling gold, silver, and foreign currencies held by the people, re-establishing the gold content of the Gold Yuan and the exchange rates of gold, silver, silver coins, and foreign currencies against the Gold Yuan. People are allowed to possess gold, silver, and foreign currencies, but except for silver coins, they are not allowed to trade or circulate them. At the same time, preparations are underway to mint Gold Yuan coins in denominations of one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, and one hundred yuan. It is stipulated that people can exchange Gold Yuan notes for Gold Yuan coins, and before the Gold Yuan coins are minted, they can exchange for gold or silver coins according to the ratio. These measures were proposed by the newly appointed Minister of Finance, Xu Kan, and were first submitted to the Kuomintang Central Political Committee for discussion before being passed by the Provisional Political Affairs Meeting at 3 PM on the 11th. The meeting was personally chaired by President Chiang, and after the meeting, it was immediately submitted to the Political Affairs Meeting for discussion. It was passed and implemented from today.

### Supplementary Budget for the Second Half of the Year Enters Review Stage

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The first supplementary budget proposal for the central government's general budget and special budget for the second half of the 37th year has been submitted to the Legislative Yuan by the Executive Yuan after being reported at the 18th regular meeting, and it has now entered the review stage. It is reported that the revenue part of the supplementary budget proposal for the general budget is drafted in accordance with the provisions of the financial and economic emergency decree, and the increase in revenue includes direct taxes, commodity taxes, state-produced tobacco and alcohol taxes, salt taxes, mining taxes, etc., as well as fines, regulatory fees, and property income. The increase in these two subjects is the most, about seven times the original budget. Customs revenue is estimated based on US aid imports, trade imports, and self-provided foreign exchange imports, and the supplementary amount is about twice the original budget. There is no increase in land tax collection in kind and state-owned enterprise surplus. The expenditure part includes all expenses that have been supplemented for emergency allocations as approved by the Executive Yuan's 16th meeting on September 15th, and have not yet completed the legislative procedure, and they are all included as they are. Among them, the salaries of public employees, teachers, and military and police personnel account for the largest part, about 8.4 times more than the original budget, followed by office expenses, which are about 6 times more than the original budget. The public expenses payable to supervisors at all levels have been listed as new subjects since August. In addition, the revision of the foreign exchange rate and the arrangement of debt expenses have been increased or reduced separately according to the various methods determined after the currency system reform, but the total amount is still a considerable amount of supplementary expenditure. The total amount of food and non-staple food expenses for military officers and soldiers, public-funded students in national schools, recipients of relief agencies, and prisoners has also increased by one and a half times compared to the original budget. In total, the actual increase in revenue and expenditure of the supplementary general budget is 461,085,236 yuan, which is about 4.3 times more than the original legal currency converted into gold yuan, which is 107,873,000 yuan, and the revenue and expenditure can still be offset. As for the special budget, the revenue part is mostly increased by the sale price of property and materials, and the cotton yarn tax in the customs import surcharges and commodity taxes is also supplemented, while the requisition of grain has been slightly reduced. In the expenditure part, the expenditure of the national defense authority on the salaries of officers and soldiers and transportation expenses has been greatly supplemented. The expenditure of the Ministry of Transportation is mainly increased due to the foreign exchange conversion difference and business subsidies. In addition, the expenditure of the Ministry of Food and the subsidy expenditure of various provinces and cities have also been approved. In total, the actual increase in the revenue and expenditure of the supplementary special budget is four times the legal currency converted into gold yuan listed in the original special budget. However, the bond revenue and loan revenue in the revenue part are all insufficient to cover the expenditure, and funds need to be raised to make up for it.

Editorial

### Thoughts on the Anniversary of the Birth of the Father of the Nation

Today is the anniversary of the birth of the Father of the Nation. On this auspicious day with clear skies and refreshing air, we should be joyful and celebrate the birthday of the Father of the Republic of China and the nation enthusiastically. However, looking north to Biyun Temple and south to Zijin Mountain, half of China is shrouded in the flames of war, filled with the sounds of killing, and most of the people are struggling on the brink of starvation. Even paying respects at his mausoleum is impossible. The nation is in turmoil, the world is in uproar. If we wish to realize the ideals of the New China based on the Three Principles of the People, which the Father of the Nation strived for during forty years of revolution, how much more effort will we, the people who came after him, especially the members of the Kuomintang, need to make? As of today, all we can feel towards the spirit of the Father of the Nation is deep shame and guilt!

As we recall the history of China since the birth of the Father of the Nation eighty-two years ago, face up to the various crises lurking within the country, and look forward to the future of our nation's revolution and reconstruction, we are filled with a myriad of complex emotions and do not know where to begin. But when we think of the life of the Father of the Nation, we are given a hundredfold of courage. As long as we can be as sincere and strive as hard as the Father of the Nation, and everyone follows his principles, what is there to fear about the success of the revolution and national reconstruction? And what is there to fear about the nation not becoming prosperous, strong, healthy and happy? The most urgent matter now is that the entire nation, from top to bottom, must deeply reflect, severely blame ourselves, and thoroughly be determined, and not allow any slightest decline!

The life of the Father of the Nation was burning with a passion for patriotism and saving the world. With his supreme and unwavering spirit, he led the national revolution for forty years, never fearing hardship, never avoiding danger, never yielding, and fighting hard, until the very last moment of his life, still not forgetting the great cause of "Peace, Struggle, Save China." We have such a great leader leading us in the revolution and national reconstruction. As long as we, starting from the moment of his passing, follow the Father of the Nation's last words: "The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades must still strive" and "Peace, Struggle, Save China," then we can absolutely believe that national affairs would never have reached the unmanageable situation of today. Looking back at the past twenty-odd years, whether it is the members of the Kuomintang, or the people who follow the Father of the Nation's teachings, they either lacked sufficient enthusiasm or acted insincerely in the great cause of revolution and national reconstruction. Some even degenerated and became corrupted in the name of revolution, becoming obstacles to revolution and national reconstruction. Reflecting on the past and present, we cannot help but feel deeply saddened.

What's past cannot be mended, but what's to come can be pursued. We have let down the Father of the Nation in many ways in the past, and we don't need to dwell on what has already happened. But from now on, we must change our ways and cleanse our hearts, so as not to let down the Father of the Nation, nor the Three Principles of the People. Although the current situation is critical, it is by no means impossible to salvage. We believe that, for now, the only way is to follow the Father of the Nation's last words, thoroughly revolutionize, and strive to build the nation. The government should prioritize the people in everything and consider everything for the people, no longer acting arrogantly, closing itself off, and always thinking that "the people can be made to follow, but cannot be made to understand," or even doing things that are contrary to the people's likes and dislikes. And the people should sincerely cooperate with the government and work together. As long as everyone works together, makes a great determination, any difficulty can be overcome, and the revolution and national reconstruction will surely succeed. Moreover, we can only discover the path to national rejuvenation from the Father of the Nation's last words. The Father of the Nation's revolutionary theory is nationalistic, not class-based, and can be called the only way to save the nation. The reason why the eight-year war of resistance could turn defeat into victory was because of the Father of the Nation's nationalism, which enabled all the people of the country, regardless of north or south, regardless of men or women, to sacrifice everything to fight for national freedom. Now, the war is raging throughout the country, and its nature is a war between nationalism and communism. As long as the government can understand the Father of the Nation's revolutionary theory that transcends class, pay special attention to the common people, and seek to stabilize the people's livelihood, all sources of unrest can be eliminated invisibly. At the same time, as long as the people can know that communism comes with its international aggressive background, they will naturally be able to jointly inspire the national spirit of shared hatred against the enemy to extinguish this traitorous flame! We must reverse the overall situation and turn things around to be worthy of the spirit of the Father of the Nation in heaven!

### US Economic Cooperation Administration Intensifies Grain Shipments to China; Hong Kong Government Announces Shipment of 10,000 Tons of Rice to Shanghai

[United Press, Washington, 10th] Government authorities announced on the 10th that the Economic Cooperation Administration is intensifying grain shipments to China. The current grain shortage in China is not due to the agency's failure to provide assistance as scheduled, but rather due to the Chinese government's failure to supply grain for October, November, and December in accordance with the agreement established with the agency months ago. During the period when new grain was harvested in China in March, the agency had planned not to ship grain during this period. Now, due to the urgent situation, the agency is expediting the shipment of flour and wheat from the northwestern United States to China for continued distribution. This batch of grain was originally scheduled to be shipped early next year, but has now been shipped ahead of schedule and is expected to arrive in China successively from late November. The agency has also allocated another $3,801,000 to continue purchasing Burmese rice for distribution in South and Central China. Flour and wheat will be shipped to Qingdao, Tianjin, and other non-rice-eating areas in North China. The date of arrival of Burmese rice depends on the shipping situation in Burma. According to unofficial estimates, the economic aid to China portion of the Economic Cooperation Administration has now allocated $150 million, including $10 million for wheat and $22 million for petroleum, all of which have already been shipped. In addition, there are $5 million for flour, $27 million for rice, $70 million for cotton, and $7 million for fertilizer.

[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 11th] The Hong Kong government announced on the 11th that, in response to the Economic Cooperation Administration's emergency appeal and in view of the severe grain shortage in Shanghai and the occurrence of rice riots, it has decided to urgently ship 10,000 tons of rice to Shanghai. The first batch of rice is scheduled to be shipped to Shanghai on the 12th.

[Our City News] The China branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration reported that the US Economic Cooperation Administration announced on the evening of the 11th that it had borrowed 10,000 tons of rice from the Hong Kong government for urgent shipment to Shanghai to relieve the current grain shortage in Shanghai. The first batch of 1,600 tons is expected to arrive in Shanghai next Tuesday on the Zesheng Wheel of Jardine Matheson. The remaining portion is expected to be fully delivered before the 23rd of this month.

### Chief of the Culture and Education Committee of the North China General Suppression Command, Qin Juchuan, Gives a Politically Significant Speech; Optimistic About the Overall Situation in North China

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 11th] After the defeat in the Northeast war, it was widely rumored among North China officials that the Commander-in-Chief would issue an important announcement on the current situation to stabilize people's minds. However, the announcement has not yet been issued. Qin Juchuan, the chief of the Culture and Education Committee of the North China General Suppression Command, suddenly gave a politically significant speech to teachers of primary and secondary schools in the city yesterday. It is generally believed that this speech is the incarnation of Mr. Fu's announcement. Qin revealed in his speech: (1) The Central Government has delegated full authority over North China to Commander-in-Chief Fu. Three hours before the President left Beiping, he told Mr. Fu that if the measures of the North China General Suppression Command conflict with the central government's laws and regulations, Mr. Fu's opinion should be the basis. Commander-in-Chief Fu can now let go and do things. (2) Before the loss of the Northeast, American officials had advocated direct aid to North China, but Fu refused because he wanted to maintain national unity and respect the central government's authority. He continued: After Commander-in-Chief Fu returned from Nanjing, he was very optimistic about the current situation, saying: "The defeat in the Northeast means that the situation in North China is serious and must be reversed with all our strength. The defeat in the Northeast means that the pressure on North China has increased, but it has not fundamentally shaken our survival, but rather is an opportunity for transformation, because: 1. The loss of the Northeast will make the United States value Europe less; 2. The loss of the Northeast will be a strategic change and the best time to strengthen total war; 3. In the future, North China will be commanded by a traditional unified command, which is beneficial to North China; 4. Now that the Northeast has fallen, those corrosive forces and people without firm confidence have left, which reduces the heavy burden on North China."

### Verdict of the International Military Tribunal; Accusations of the Japanese Army's Barbaric Acts Confirmed; Tojo and Others Should Be Held Responsible

[United Press, Tokyo, 11th] The International Military Tribunal continued to read the verdict today, believing that the Japanese army and navy, from 1931 to the time of surrender in 1945, had abused torture, "raped, killed, and committed other most barbaric and inhuman acts." According to international law, all government officials and military leaders during this period should be held responsible for their duties. The atrocities of the Japanese army were the same everywhere, which shows that they were secretly ordered by the Japanese government or its individual military commanders, or deliberately condoned. Defendants such as Tojo, Itagaki, Hirota, Hiranuma, Ko　, Take, Sada, Umezu, Kimura, Matsui, Hata Shunroku, Oshima, Shimada, Hoshino, Suzuki, and Shigemitsu Kui, etc., should be held especially responsible.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 11th] The verdict of the International Military Tribunal pointed out that the Japanese troops occupying Nanjing were barbaric troops. During the first six weeks of their occupation of the Chinese capital, they massacred 200,000 civilians and prisoners. This kind of barbaric behavior of the Japanese army cannot be regarded as an uncontrollable military action at the time. The large-scale rape, killing, and arson actions of the Japanese army continued for at least a week after the fall of Nanjing.

### Marshall to Return Home to Meet Truman; Comprehensive Review of the World Situation; Truman-Stalin Meeting Unlikely if the Soviet Union Does Not Show Sincerity for Peace

[United Press, Paris, 10th] The US delegation to the UN General Assembly announced tonight that Secretary of State Marshall will return to Washington in late November to conduct a comprehensive review of the world situation with President Truman. The possibility of direct US-Soviet negotiations is also included. News of a possible meeting between Stalin and Truman has spread from Moscow and Rome, which has greatly excited the UN General Assembly, but Marshall has neither confirmed nor denied it.

[United Press, Key West, Florida, 10th] President Truman's secretary, Ayers, stated that there are no arrangements for a Truman-Stalin meeting. He reiterated the President's previous statement that he would be happy to meet with Stalin at any time if he wished to come to the United States.

[United Press, Washington, 11th] Diplomatic circles here believe that the Soviet Union's interest in a "Truman-Stalin Peace Conference" is another attempt by the Soviet Union to undermine the unity of Western countries. Senior diplomatic officials stated that they believe the Kremlin will use the Truman-Stalin meeting to achieve purely propaganda value. They predict that the Soviet Union will not miss the opportunity and will use this meeting between the two powers to weaken cooperation between the United States and non-communist countries in Western Europe. According to their assessment, the Truman-Stalin talks will provide the Soviet Union with further weapons to undermine the Marshall Plan and the ongoing North Atlantic Alliance. According to an 8th report in the "Washington Times-Herald" regarding the possible brewing of a Truman-Stalin meeting, which was transcribed by TASS, all Moscow newspapers published it prominently on the 10th, which is generally considered to indicate that the Soviet Union does not reject it. However, the opinion of the State Department is that this meeting may be useless or even harmful, and this matter must wait until the United States has established its military strength before the Soviet Union can understand that the US foreign policy is "seeking truth from facts." Diplomats further believe that if the Soviet Union is indeed interested in peace, it has ample opportunities to express goodwill to the West in Berlin, at the United Nations, and elsewhere. US officials believe that a Truman-Stalin meeting in the near future is unlikely to happen for the following reasons: (1) The Soviet Union has already shown that it has no sincerity in reaching any agreement other than a "paper agreement." (2) After Stalin and Truman meet, they may use more "peace propaganda," minor concessions, and superficial cooperation to overturn the US preparation plan, which will give the Soviet Union more time to tighten its control over satellite countries and establish fifth columns in other countries. (3) If the Truman-Stalin meeting fails to reach an agreement, it will inevitably accelerate the showdown between the two countries.

### Jiang Tingfu Speaks at the Political Committee; Opposes Soviet Disarmament Proposal; Demands Disarmament of Fifth Columns

[This Newspaper] Paris, 11th Broadcast: Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu stated in the UN General Assembly Political Committee that the Communist Party is using 50,000 Japanese prisoners of war to fight against the government. When discussing the Soviet Union's proposal to reduce the military strength of the five powers by one-third, Jiang stated that China should propose that the United Nations take action to disarm fifth columns around the world. Jiang stated that the Japanese prisoners of war captured by the Soviet Union are being used by the Northeast Communist Army as artillerymen, pilots, and tank soldiers. In addition, there are 30,000 Japanese serving the Communist Army in the Northeast. Jiang explained that the government is extremely concerned about the rapid advance of the Communist Army, and China will never accept the Soviet Union's proposal in its current state.

### Soviet Union Supports Israel; Opposes Bunche Plan; Security Council Considers Enforcing Ceasefire Order

[United Press, Paris, 10th] UN Acting Mediator Bunche suggested on the 10th that the United Nations try to take steps to designate most of the Negev region in southern Palestine as a demilitarized zone. This action would require a large-scale withdrawal of Israeli troops from the positions they recently captured from the Egyptian army. Bunche's proposal has been submitted to the Security Council's seven-member committee for consideration of how to implement the Security Council's order. The committee may study methods of enforcement if the Jews refuse to withdraw from the Negev region. The Jewish side has already hinted that they will refuse this order. The Security Council also discussed the Palestinian issue on the 10th and listened to Soviet representative Malik's request to establish an Arab-Jewish peace conference as soon as possible. Malik urged the Security Council to order direct negotiations between the Arab and Jewish sides to "establish a formal peace" through Bunche. The request of Bunche or the Soviet representative implied their rejection of Bunche's proposal on the 9th, believing that this proposal is only a ceasefire and not a comprehensive peace plan. The Soviet Union's position seems to be very much in favor of the Jewish side, but it is inconsistent with the views of Britain and France, and may also be different from the views of the United States.

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 10th] Israeli troops launched an offensive against Faluja on the 10th. The area is a flat plain and difficult to defend.

### Jews Arrest Observers; Armistice Committee Protests

[Agence France-Presse, Haifa, 10th] Two United Nations observers were arrested by Israeli military police yesterday on the Negev front while watching Israeli troops attack Iraq Suwaydan village held by the Egyptian army.

### New Crisis in the French Cabinet

[United Press, Paris, 11th] The coalition cabinet of French Prime Minister Queuille faced a new threat of labor unrest on the 11th, as the communist-controlled General Confederation of Labor has planned a 24-hour railway strike, and the port strike may be extended indefinitely. While miners in the northern coal region ignored the call of the General Confederation of Labor and resumed work in large numbers, union officials met over the weekend to discuss new strike strategies. The General Confederation of Labor has re-demanded that recent labor costs be 15,500 francs per month, which is 35% higher than what the government has promised. At the same time, the left wing of the Socialist Party is demanding that the party withdraw from the Queuille government. The party's national congress will be held on the 13th and 14th to discuss strategies after the Gaullists' victory in the upper house elections.

Says it Actually Allows the Revival of Japanese Reactionaries

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 11th] Soviet representative to the Allied Council for Japan, Derevyanko, delivered a speech at the founding of the Japanese-Soviet Club on the night of the 10th, fiercely attacking the United States' policy in Japan. He criticized anti-Soviet propaganda for completely erasing the fact that the Soviet Union actually wanted to conclude a peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible and the Soviet Union's efforts for this treaty, and for not making it public to the Japanese public. The actual responsibility for the delay of the peace treaty with Japan should be borne by other countries, but this is not known to the Japanese people. He also severely criticized the US occupation policy. He also attacked the US occupying authorities for disregarding the Far Eastern Commission's instructions to disarm Japan, and for allowing the revival of Japanese reactionaries. Finally, he attacked the US authorities for taking brutal offensives against legitimate labor unions, "and a terrorist police regime has now been formed."

### France Opposes Anglo-American Resolution; Insists on International Control of the Ruhr

[United Press, London, 11th] The conference of six countries (Britain, the United States, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg) to discuss the ownership system of Ruhr industry opened here today. France opposes the Anglo-American occupying military government's proposal to transfer control of the steel industry to the German government in the future. Britain and the United States are trying to ease French emotions, because if there is a gap in the West's handling of the German issue, serious consequences will occur in the East-West Berlin negotiations. French Foreign Minister Schuman lodged a strong protest with Britain and the United States on the 10th, insisting that the Ruhr be placed under international control. Well-informed sources believe that the French representative will explain the impact of the Anglo-American resolution on French domestic affairs, as the Queuille government is currently facing a major crisis of labor unrest.

The above-mentioned three ports in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean have large-scale warship repair facilities. The Evening Standard also stated that the United States may request that Britain hand over a naval base in British territory entirely for the use of the US fleet for its disposal.

### Greek Government Expresses No Compromise with Guerrillas

Automatic Surrender Will be Granted Amnesty

[United Press, Athens, 10th] Eight former Greek cabinet members sent a letter to Prime Minister Sophoulis yesterday, requesting the government to accept the proposal of Australian Foreign Minister Evatt at the UN General Assembly to hold peace talks with the three communist countries to the north. Sophoulis replied today, stating that compromising with the northern communist guerrillas is tantamount to surrendering to forces that the Greek people despise. This move will not only fail to end the war in the north, but will also expand the bloodshed, ultimately leading to the extinction of the Greek race. Although compromise is impossible, the government will still grant amnesty to guerrillas who lay down their weapons and surrender. Gentlemen have the right to speak on national affairs, but do not represent public opinion, and this kind of proposition is actually an unpatriotic act.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th] A strange incident occurred during the Political Committee's discussion of the Greek issue today. The committee adopted parts of the Soviet Union's proposal on the Greek issue out of context, causing the meaning of the adopted sections to be completely contrary to the meaning of the original Soviet proposal, forcing the Soviet representative to abstain from voting during the vote. The introduction of the Soviet Union's original proposal criticized foreign interference in Greece (obviously referring to the United States), demanded the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Greece, restricted the powers of the Balkan Committee, demanded that the Greek government stop racial discrimination, and restore diplomatic relations with neighboring countries to resolve border refugees and other issues. However, during the vote, the committee rejected the statement in the preamble that the current situation in Greece was the result of foreign interference by a vote of 49 to 6; the first section of the Soviet proposal was passed by a vote of 53 to 2, requesting Greece to establish diplomatic relations with Bulgaria and Albania; the second section was passed with 49 votes to 6 abstentions, inviting countries such as Greece, Bulgaria, and Albania to resolve border and refugee issues. At the afternoon meeting, the committee rejected the section demanding that the Greek government stop racial discrimination against the Macedonian and Albanian minorities by a vote of 21 to 13 (9 abstentions), and passed the fifth section of the Soviet proposal by a vote of 44 to 1 (1 abstention), requiring the governments of Greece, Bulgaria, and Albania to submit reports to the United Nations Secretariat within six months on the progress of establishing diplomatic relations and resolving border and refugee issues.

Bartering 20,000 Bolts of Cotton Cloth for Rice
The Management Office Continues Investigation

[Our Dispatch] Yu Jiyu, Chief Secretary of the Inspection Committee, stated that the Management Office is continuing to investigate the bartering of 20,000 bolts of cotton cloth for rice. As of now, the transaction ledgers have not been submitted to the office. According to rice merchants, they were ordered to supply Shanghai with price-controlled rice starting October 10th until the end of October. The purchase price of the controlled-price rice was based on the market price in the producing areas, which was higher than the controlled price. Based on this calculation, the rice merchants suffered a significant loss, and the government needs to supply price-controlled cloth worth 80,000 gold yuan to compensate for the loss.
Unprecedented Crowding on Two Railway Lines
More Than a Dozen Casualties in One Day

[Our Dispatch] The level of crowding on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway lines in recent days can be described as unprecedented. The North Station and West Station of this city are packed with people all day long. The long queues of dozens of feet for buying tickets are often dispersed by the crowds. Injuries and fainting due to squeezing are commonplace. The white Red Cross ambulances of the railway hospital are frequently parked in the square of the North Station to transport injured passengers. Station employees are overworked and hoarse. The situation along the line is also chaotic. Yesterday alone, there were 11 unfortunate incidents of passengers falling from trains on the two lines. An elderly passenger (name unknown) at the West Railway Station died on the spot from being squeezed. It is difficult to immediately calculate the total number of casualties. The estimated total is over 30 people.

Yesterday, the operation of the trains was nearly in a state of disorder. The Qiantang train to Shanghai was four hours late, and other passenger trains could not depart or arrive on time. Every time a train departed, the top of the train and the area around the locomotive were filled with passengers. Even after a train had started, passengers still tried to squeeze into the train at the last second, and many were left hanging outside the train by holding onto the train windows and doors.
Investigating Responsibility for the Falling-from-Train Tragedy

The Railway Bureau's Police Department and Transportation Department are currently investigating the responsibility for the tragic accident of passengers falling from the 27th passenger train near the West Station yesterday morning (reported in yesterday's newspaper). It is reported that the waiting rooms for third and fourth-class passengers were overcrowded, and the ticket-checking order was chaotic, causing a large number of passengers to enter the station without having their tickets checked, resulting in the train being overloaded. Passengers climbed onto the roof of the train, leading to the tragedy. The bodies of the deceased have been sent to the morgue for examination. The prosecutors of the District Prosecutor's Office are conducting autopsies and keeping records. The injured who were sent to the railway hospital include Chen Zhongheng, Liang Guihong, Ruan Chengmu, and Tanaka Sheng. The whereabouts of other missing passengers are still under investigation.
Night Trains to Shanghai Advance Departure Time

After the temporary martial law was announced in this city, Chen Bozhuang, the director of the two railway bureaus, negotiated with the municipal authorities because the martial law time started at 11:00 p.m., which caused difficulties in the railway bureau's operations. He requested that the start time be extended to midnight. It is heard that Mayor Wu has agreed to consider it and it may be realized. At the same time, the night trains to Shanghai from Nanjing and Hangzhou, which were originally scheduled to arrive after 11:00 p.m., will advance their departure times. Detailed measures are being studied.
Chef of Lao Zhengxing Restaurant Died Returning to His Hometown After Being Squeezed on the Jiangjing Steamer

When he arrived at Pier No. 3 to board the Jiangjing Steamer, Zhang fainted from being squeezed in the crowded passenger flow. He was taken to the hospital but died.
Abnormal Crowding of Passengers on Shanghai-Ningbo Steamers
China Merchants Bureau Strengthens Order Maintenance

The Shanghai-Ningbo line of the China Merchants Bureau has seen abnormal crowding of passengers. It is heard that because rice, pork, chicken, and duck are cheaper in Ningbo than in Shanghai, peddlers are seizing the opportunity to profit. In addition, because rice is difficult to purchase in this city, prices are high, and life is not easy, those who do not need to stay in Shanghai are returning to their hometowns in Ning Shao, leading to unprecedented crowding of passengers and making it difficult to maintain order at the pier and on the ship. The company has adopted a method of limiting ticket purchases to restrict the number of people. Unfortunately, this has also led to passengers without tickets rushing to board the ship. The Jiangya Steamer, originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the evening of the 10th, was unable to sail due to the swarm of passengers without tickets. It was delayed until after 11:00 p.m. before departing for Ningbo. The situation at the pier on the evening of the 11th was still extremely chaotic, resulting in trampling and injuries to passengers. After the company received the report, it immediately dispatched more police officers to maintain order and originally planned to add a Sunday sailing in addition to the existing sailings from Monday to Saturday. Starting next week, landing craft will also be used in conjunction with the original sailings to travel between Shanghai and Ningbo.
First Trial of Zhan Peilin and Others in the Paper Hoarding Case
Both Defendants Deny Hoarding

[Our Dispatch] Zhan Peilin, chairman of the Paper Industry Association and owner of Yiji Xing Paper Shop, and his brother, Zhan Yutian, factory director of Yizhong Paper Mill, have been indicted by the Special Criminal Court on suspicion of hoarding and profiteering. The case was tried yesterday by Judge Jiang Shanchu of the Special Criminal Court. Zhan Peilin flatly denied the accusation of hoarding, stating that according to the paper registration regulations of the Social Affairs Bureau, only newsprint and rough-edged paper were regulated, and the inventory should not exceed one-quarter of the total sales of the previous year. According to the defendant, the turnover of Yiji Xing Paper Shop last year was approximately 9,000 reams, and the seized goods amounted to over 900 reams, which is less than one-quarter. Zhan Yutian stated that the 870 rolls of various paper stock seized were raw materials for papermaking and not daily necessities, so they were not subject to control. The court then summoned witnesses, and because further investigation was needed, the hearing was adjourned to a later date.
Appeal Judgment in the Stock Dumping Case
Sentences of Three Defendants Reduced

[Our Dispatch] Du Weiping, Lin Legeng, and Xu Yang Shuyao, the defendants in the stock dumping case, were originally sentenced by the District Court to eight months of imprisonment for Du, eight months for Lin, and seven months for Xu Yangshuyao. The defendants were dissatisfied and appealed to the High Court. Yesterday was the date for the judgment to be announced. Du and the other two defendants were released on bail and did not appear in court. Fang Fushu and Gu Xianggui, Lin's defense lawyers, and Ru Baobao Yi, Xu's defense lawyer, were present to hear the judgment. At 10 a.m., Judge Chen Zhensheng, on behalf of Chief Judge Xiao, read out the main text of the judgment: "Du Weiping, jointly and continuously buying and selling outside the exchange to which he belongs, and using the same calculation method for the entrustor, is sentenced to six months of imprisonment. Lin Legeng, jointly and not within the exchange to which he belongs, buying and selling, and using the same calculation method for the entrustor, is sentenced to six months of imprisonment. Xu Yangshuyao, outside the exchange, trading at the market price, specializing in calculating profits and losses, selling short, is sentenced to four months of imprisonment. If the sentence is commuted to a fine, it shall be calculated at three gold yuan per day." After the judgment was read, the defendants' lawyers stated that the commutation to a fine may not be approved when the sentence is executed, and requested that it be clearly stated that the commutation to a fine is approved to facilitate execution. The court stated that there was no precedent for this point and instructed that a separate written request be submitted for a separate ruling.

Tight Credit, Shortage of Cash
Unprecedented Number of Bounced Checks
Banks Restrict Customer Withdrawals

Yesterday, credit remained tight, and the shortage of cash worsened. Not only commercial banks felt the threat, but also national banks and bureaus found it difficult to manage their finances. It was especially inconvenient for branches of banks and bureaus outside of Shanghai to transfer funds. Responsible parties stated that the reasons for the cash shortage were: firstly, rising prices; secondly, merchants carrying cash to purchase goods in other cities; and most importantly, the limit of 2 billion on the amount of currency issued. The tight credit in recent days has caused many industrial and commercial enterprises to experience financial difficulties. The number of bounced checks is unprecedented, leading to frequent disputes over interbank lending. Those who have cash are very cautious about lending it out.

The financial market in this city has recently experienced unprecedentedly serious phenomena: one is a shortage of cash, and the other is extremely tight credit. Due to the shortage of cash, the discount for every thousand yuan reached as high as 200 yuan. Due to the extremely tight credit, the daily interest rate for interbank lending reached a peak of 170 yuan per thousand, and a daily interest rate of 100 yuan was very common. The Central Bank has decided to provide as much convenience as possible for the payment of interbank deposits, without any strict regulations, and to determine the payment standard based on the amount of funds available. National banks and bureaus have slightly restricted withdrawals of deposits since the 10th, tentatively setting a limit of 600,000 yuan per institution. Commercial banks and bureaus have a temporary limit of 200,000 yuan, and national banks and bureaus and commercial banks and bureaus limit cash withdrawals for general customers to 300 yuan per household. Under these circumstances, it is of course difficult to cope. National banks and bureaus and commercial banks and bureaus have begun to issue cashier's checks. As a result, the number of checks has increased sharply, and commercial banks and bureaus have implemented austerity measures, including stopping lending and refusing overdrafts, to prevent accidents. According to the person in charge of the Bankers Association who spoke to the reporter, the current phenomenon of cash shortage and tight credit is due to soaring prices and increased currency circulation speed. At present, the open prices have risen more than ten times above the restricted prices. Although prices are being forced to plummet now, it is hoped that the government can seize the opportunity to find a way to stabilize them. Without special factors, price stability should not be a problem.
Adjustment of Domestic Exchange Rates

The Central Bank's exchange rates for remittances to various places are tentatively changed from tomorrow (13th). The exchange rate for remittances to Changsha, Hengyang, Yuanling, Hankou, Chongqing, Chengdu, Wanxian, Zigong, Xuzhou, Pingjin, Qingdao, Nanchang, Ji'an, Wuhu, Kunming, Baoji, Tianshui, Ya'an, Kangding, Guiyang and other places will be changed to 20 yuan per thousand yuan, and Ningbo will be changed to 10 yuan per thousand yuan, while other places will remain unchanged.
Par Value of State-Owned Enterprise Stocks to Be Adjusted Soon

[Our Dispatch] After the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks was suspended, the relevant authorities will re-evaluate all enterprises that have issued stocks, and the par value will also be adjusted before sales are resumed. It is reported that the main reason for the suspension of sales is that the prices of all goods are expensive, while the prices of state-owned enterprise stocks are low, especially the stocks of Taiwan Sugar Corporation. Due to the adjustment of the exchange rate between the Taiwan dollar and the gold yuan, the price has fallen threefold in effect. If the par value is not increased, it will also cause a buying spree.
Scarce Cotton Yarn Transactions

The yarn market is still weak due to tight credit and weak demand from all parties. As today (12th) is Sun Yat-sen's birthday and the market is closed, transactions had to be settled on the same day, so the market was slightly active at the close. The opening price of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 8,500 yuan, but due to active spot settlements, transactions were scarce and the price once fell to 7,800 yuan. It then followed the cloth market and recovered to 8,000 yuan at the close, a slight decrease of 500 yuan from the previous day. The closing price of 21-count Double Horse yarn was 5,000 yuan, 32-count Silver Moon yarn was 6,500 yuan, 20-count Jincheng yarn was 4,800 yuan, 16-count Guangming yarn was 4,800 yuan, and 10-count Boy Scout yarn was 3,500 yuan (all for same-day delivery). The market atmosphere throughout the day was initially weak but then stabilized. The arbitrage market was as follows: 42-count Blue Phoenix 1,500 yuan, 21-count Double Horse 1,000 yuan, 20-count Jincheng 1,000 yuan, all for one-day term.

In addition, the announced price of cotton yarn allocated by the Textile Construction Company on the 10th was 5,000 yuan for 20-count Tianguan yarn, 3,000 yuan for 8-count Riguang yarn, 3,300 yuan for 10-count Lima yarn, 7,000 yuan for 40-count Riguang yarn, and 7,000 yuan for 40-count Red Treasure Light yarn.
Cotton Cloth Retail Stores Resume Business

Due to tight credit in the cotton cloth market, retail stores have resumed business in order to obtain cash. However, the purchasing power of citizens is weak. The asking price outside the market for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 240-250 yuan. Tianjin merchants and platform merchants competed for purchases, and the price gradually rose. Around 11:00 a.m., the price once reached as high as around 300 yuan. However, due to selling at high prices, the price fell back to 270 yuan near noon, an increase of 20 yuan compared to the previous day. Four Gentlemen serge had clear transactions due to the Textile Construction Company's allocation, and the price was in line with Dragon Head fine cloth.

[Our Dispatch] The China Textile Construction Company quoted and sold cotton cloth yesterday as usual. A total of six types of cotton cloth and three types of American-Mexican cloth were offered. The quoted prices were 285 yuan for Four Gentlemen Yuanzhigong, 160 yuan for Jumping Carp Gray Twill, 300 yuan for Jumping Carp Jingyuan Direct Buy, 200 yuan for Deputy Brand 29.5-yard Serge Fabric and 5 B 12-pound fine cloth, and 195 yuan for Dragon Head 12-pound fine cloth. As a result, a total of 4,400 bolts were sold, with a total of 143 purchase orders, including 8 orders from manufacturers for 880 bolts and 135 orders from cloth shops for 3,520 bolts, totaling 536,000 yuan.

In addition, the company also quoted and sold four types of woolen fabrics yesterday, but because the quoted prices were too low, no sales were made.

The two markets are processing the replacement of the membership cards of all members today and tomorrow, and all will be completed tomorrow.

Rice Market Returns to Normal
Bai Geng Sold at 700 Yuan

A total of 25 shi were traded, with Bai Geng priced at 700 yuan, early rice at 600 yuan, Bai Yuan at 700 yuan, and rough Geng at 650 yuan, the price being level with the previous day. The arrival of goods to the market was still scarce. 635 shi were registered to have arrived at the South Market, and trading at the North Market was stagnant due to the lack of rice source, presenting a situation of scarce arrivals and sales. Yesterday, off-market trading of rice also plummeted.

In addition, in order to dredge rice sources and stabilize the people's livelihood, Mayor Wu ordered rice industry merchants and distributors to purchase 20 dan of rice per unit per day starting on the 14th of this month for the city's food supply. Those who violate this will have their food department licenses revoked and ordered to suspend business.
Flour, Food Oil, and Miscellaneous Grains All Fall

The flour market saw large-scale trading yesterday, with prices plummeting, falling more than 60% from the peak price of 400 yuan per bag. Bingshipai opened at 165 yuan, and briefly rose to 170 yuan in between, but closed at the original level. Dafadengta was 180 yuan, Lan Jiancheng was 150 yuan, Maigen was 180 yuan, and Fuxin bran was 120 yuan.

In the food oil market, due to tight credit and a hidden interest rate of one yuan, most sold to obtain cash, and the market was oversupplied. The local bean oil opened at 900 yuan, but the market fell to 850 yuan at the close. Raw oil remained at the original level, sesame oil saw no transactions, and vegetable oil was 700 yuan, which was 140 yuan lower than yesterday. Cooked vegetable oil also fell by 100 yuan, and the lack of cash caused a wave of bounced checks.

The price of miscellaneous grains also fell sharply, with yellow soybeans falling by 30 yuan and corn falling by 10 yuan. Other goods were also oversupplied.

Market Price List
The Economic Climate of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong on November 11th
By Our Reporter Mao Shukui

[Our Dispatch] In late October, the price restriction policy was still effective in Shanghai, but in Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong, it had long been replaced by "negotiated prices" and "free trade." We arrived in Nanchang on October 23rd, where a case involving prices was circulating. It is said that a training director of a local middle school purchased a suit from a tailor shop, agreeing on a total cost of 120 yuan for labor and materials. The shopkeeper requested payment in full at once. After repeated consultations, both parties agreed to pay half first, and the remaining half would be paid when the clothes were picked up five days later.

A Custom-Made Suit Generates Endless Twists and Turns

The training director did not pick up the clothes until the seventh day, delaying for two days. During these two days, prices rose by 40%. The shopkeeper demanded compensation for the loss of 60 yuan, plus an additional 20 yuan. The customer knew he was in the wrong and agreed, paying 60 yuan to take back a pair of pants first, stating that he would prepare another 20 yuan the next day to pick up the coat. The unexpected expense really troubled him. With great difficulty, he managed to gather the money on the third day to pick up the coat, but the shopkeeper reneged because prices had risen even more during these two days. He insisted on adding another 20 yuan before giving him the coat. This angered the training director. He went back and gathered more than a dozen students, forcibly taking the clothes. The matter was brought to the police station, with one side accusing him of using violent means to rob property, and the other side accusing him of violating price restrictions... I only stayed in Nanchang for one night, and did not have the opportunity to verify the truth of this incident or find out what happened next. However, we can get a glimpse of the price fluctuations in Nanchang from this case.

Gold and Silver Dollar Redemption Has Little Effect in Hunan and Jiangxi

The new economic measures of redeeming gold and silver dollars did not have much effect in Jiangxi and Hunan. The common people still refused to give up prices based on silver dollars. Farmers still insisted on selling one zu of rice for ten yuan. The Changsha Central Daily News once published a very frank news item about the black market for gold and silver: "There is no gold trading in gold shops, and silver dollars have disappeared from the market. However, transactions are still being conducted underground very secretly. It secretly guides the rise and fall of prices and stubbornly occupies people's hearts." The social environment and political organization could not strictly enforce the "August 19" price restrictions here, so the local government could only adopt more peaceful "negotiated prices" and "persuasion" to allow prices to find a suitable level in the relationship between supply and demand.

The Black Market Prices in Hong Kong and Macau React Very Quickly

Prices in Guangzhou once experienced chaos. This was caused by the exchange rates for gold, silver, and foreign currencies set by the government when reforming the monetary system. Chairman Song Ziwen also pointed out: Hong Kong and Macau are too close to Guangzhou, and prices react extremely quickly to the black market for Hong Kong dollars. Therefore, all kinds of rigid price restrictions do not work here. When the reporter arrived in Guangzhou on October 27, he found that the average price in Guangzhou was about three times higher than the "August 19" price restriction in Shanghai, but strange phenomena such as "panic buying" and "goods with prices but no stock" never appeared in Guangzhou.

The Stimulation of Prices Is Not as Strong as in Shanghai

In terms of the economic climate, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong are one season ahead of Shanghai. When Shanghainese were queuing up to buy price-restricted goods, the black market prices there had already been recognized by the government. Therefore, the news of the lifting of price restrictions did not stimulate prices as quickly as in Shanghai. Now we are struggling in the cold wind, but perhaps we can still find some signs of spring in Guangdong.
Xie Youmin and Others Suspected of Corruption, Detained in Court and Publicly Prosecuted

The Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office detained them in court during the fourth hearing on the 8th and will soon file a public prosecution.
Jiaxing Organizes Patrol Teams

[Our Jiaxing Dispatch on the 11th] As winter defense approaches, the Self-Defense Headquarters, the Police Bureau, and the Standing Self-Defense Squadron of the City Center Police Station have been ordered to jointly organize patrol teams. From the 10th, patrols will be conducted from 12:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. the next day, dividing the area into sections to maintain security. Also, as the winter defense period approaches, the wooden bridges on all roads have begun to be repaired urgently, with a deadline for completion in mid-month.
The Coalfield of Bagong Mountain
By Our Reporter Dou Baiping

[Our Tianji'an Dispatch on the 7th] Bagong Mountain is located in the southwest of the 1,000-square-kilometer Huainan Basin. For many years, it was just a barren land with some traces left in history, where the so-called Eight Dukes of the Han Dynasty went to visit Prince An of Huainan, and where Xie Xuan used the grass and trees on the mountain to scare away Qin King Fu Jian in the Battle of Feishui of the Jin Dynasty. Today, Bagong Mountain is worth ten times its value. It will be one of the largest coal mines in Central China. In terms of the journey of national construction, this is truly great news.

Mechanized
Development Engineering

The reporter traveled from Jiunenggang to Tianji'an and then to Bagong Mountain. Steel and cement poles for high-voltage power transmission lines lined the road, with vast wheat fields on both sides. At the end of the road, climbing up the high slope, the mine buildings were built on a small hill. Walking into the gate, there was a towering steam furnace chimney. The mine houses with white tops and red walls were pleasing to the eye. This is just the beginning. The plan is to fully adopt mechanization, and all measures are based on the "century-long plan." The development project plans to divide the coal seams into upper and lower groups. The upper group will mine the upper five coal seams, and the lower group will mine the lowest two coal seams. The upper group will open two inclined shafts, one of which will be equipped with a non-polar belt conveyor. The non-polar belt has only been used in the United States for nearly 20 years. It is expected that after the installation, the daily output of coal will be 7,000 tons. The other one is dedicated to transporting materials and personnel up and down. Another air shaft will be opened, equipped with a slurry-type fan, with an air volume of 90,000 cubic meters per minute and a wind pressure of 4.5 inches. The lower group will also open two inclined shafts, also equipped with non-polar belt conveyors. The estimated daily output is 3,000 tons, achieving the goal of producing 10,000 tons of coal per day.

10,000 Tons
Production Ideal

Currently, the first and second inclined shafts are 122 meters deep and are both located in the upper coal seam. The inclined shafts and winches are temporary equipment and still have the nature of exploration. The third inclined shaft is 3.5 meters high and 5.5 meters wide and is located in the lower coal seam. Construction only started in September. A production volume of 10,000 tons is currently just an ideal. It needs to solve several problems first. Firstly, the area surrounding Bagong Mountain is surrounded by local communists. Wei Fenglou's Longshan troops also occasionally intrude. On the 22nd of last month, the Longshan troops occupied Fengtai, located on the north bank of the Huai River, 30 miles from the mine, causing panic in the mine. Fortunately, it was recovered, and things stabilized again. In today's situation, a great deal of effort is put into security.

Production, Sales, and Transportation
Three in One

Secondly, production, sales, and transportation are interconnected. A production volume of 10,000 tons must have equal transportation capacity. Currently, the mine has a narrow-gauge railway connected to the Huai River, using several steamships for transportation. The maximum transportation volume does not exceed 1,000 tons, which is clearly not enough. The Huainan Railway to Yuxi is still awaiting funding. Thirdly, coal mining requires the large-scale use of machinery. Without money, nothing can be said. Even the 3.5 million US dollar loan that has already been decided will all be used to import machinery and equipment. However, according to Director Wang Dezhi, if these things really arrive, it is estimated that it will take twice the amount of the US loan to arrange for installation. Indeed, the beautiful prospects of this coalfield can only be supported by funding.

### The First Half of This Month's Cost of Living Index Compiled Based on Market Prices

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday that the cost of living index for the first half of November has been finalized and will be released on the 15th. The method of salary payment for workers in all industries will follow the old practice, calculated by multiplying the base salary in Gold Yuan by the cost of living index. Discounts will still be applied as usual. For those who typically pay salaries based on the previous period's index, an approximate value of the previous period's index will also be released to facilitate calculation. The index is compiled using the August 19th prices as the base period. The distribution of daily necessities to workers, originally scheduled to begin in November, has been delayed due to the distribution certificates still being printed. Workers have not yet received the distributed goods, so the compilation of the index for the first half of November is based on market prices and not on distributed prices. The General Labor Union's request to expand the scope of distribution to include soap, cigarettes, etc., is being considered. Director Wu also stated that the authorities have considered the issue of where a large amount of floating capital will go after the cost of living index is released and salaries are paid in each industry.

### General Assembly of the Federation of Industries Requests to Move to Shanghai; Shanghai Representatives Unanimously Resolve
