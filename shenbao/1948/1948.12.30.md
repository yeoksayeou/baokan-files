### Military and Political Leaders Gather in the Capital: Zuo Yi, Ma Hongkui, Song Ziwen, and Others Rumored to Fly to Beijing Soon; President Hosts Banquet for Yan Xishan Again Yesterday

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 9th] Military and political leaders from various regions have been arriving in Nanjing in response to the President's telegram summons in recent days. Those who have already arrived include Yan Xishan and Hu Zongnan. Those who are about to arrive include Yu Han. It is also rumored that Zuo Yi, Ma Hongda, Song Ziwen, and others will come to Beijing within the next day or two. It is possible that the President will convene a meeting to discuss certain issues collectively. However, the nature of the meeting is currently unknown.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] Since General Yan Xishan arrived in Beijing, he has been in frequent contact and meetings with key figures in the capital, and has received great attention and welcome from all parties. The President hosted another banquet to welcome Yan Xishan at noon on the 29th, inviting only a few people such as Zhang Qun, Xu Yongchang, Wu Zhongxin, and Liang Huaizhi to accompany him. On the morning of the 29th, President Yu Youren of the Executive Yuan was the first to visit Yan Xishan. At 10:00 am, Zhang Qun visited again and invited Yan Xishan to a banquet at Zhang's residence on Renhe Street. At 2:00 pm, Yan Xishan left the Presidential Residence to meet with Vice President Jia Jingde of the Examination Yuan, and also had discussions with Xu Yongchang. At 4:00 pm, he attended a welcome reception for legislators. At 5:00 pm, he visited Gu Zhutong and Vice President Li Zongren successively. At 7:00 pm, he attended a banquet hosted by Vice President Jia Jingde, and did not return to his residence until 10:00 pm. On the 29th, those who visited Yan Xishan at No. 4 Ninghai Road came in an endless stream from morning to night, including Yu Youren, Zhang Qun, Huang Shaohong, Gu Zhutong, Tang Enbo, Gu Zhenggang, Gu Zhengding, Yu Hanmou, Zhang Yaoming, Wu Siyu, Di Ying, Mao Renfeng, Xu Kan, Yu Hongjun, Zheng Yancai, Ma Chaojun, and dozens of others.

### Yan Xishan Attends Tea Party with Legislators: Eloquently Reports on the Situation of the Shanxi Army; The Whole Venue Warmly Welcomes Him with Standing Ovations

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] The entire Legislative Yuan held a tea party in the main hall on the second floor of the National Assembly Hall at 4:00 pm on the 29th to welcome General Yan Xishan, Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters. President Tong and Vice President Liu Lian drove together to welcome him. When Yan Xishan arrived at the venue with his entourage, Zhang Daofan was publicly elected by the attendees to temporarily serve as chairman. Zhang stated, "Mr. Yan Baichuan, with his arduous and extraordinary spirit, fought with the bandits for three years after eight years of resistance against Japan, which is deeply admired by us. At this time of national crisis, his visit to the capital and attendance at the welcome reception of our colleagues in this Yuan make us feel especially honored." Then, he invited Yan Xishan to report on the situation in Shanxi Province and the Battle of Taiyuan. As soon as Yan Xishan stood in front of the microphone, the legislators responded with enthusiastic applause. Yan Xishan first humbly stated that this trip was only to report on his duties. He himself was responsible for the administration of a province, and now only the isolated city of Taiyuan remains. The enthusiastic support and concern of the legislators made him feel ashamed and grateful. Yan Xishan then described the Battle of Taiyuan, saying that the war in central Shanxi in the past six months could be divided into two stages: the summer conscription period, which was the wheat season, and the autumn conscription period, which was the autumn harvest season. The field battles during the wheat season lasted for three months. After the National Army assisted the people in harvesting the wheat, they concentrated their forces to launch the Battle of Taiyuan during the autumn conscription period. So far, the Communists have launched six general offensives, suffering a total loss of 260,000 troops, including 160,000 killed and wounded, and 100,000 dispersed. After four reinforcements, they now have about 40,000 troops. The National Army suffered 60,000 deaths and injuries in the field battles, and 30,000 in the Battle of Taiyuan, with a total loss of about one-third of the Communist forces. The Communists oppressed the people in various ways and drove them to the front lines, resulting in many innocent deaths and injuries, which the National Army could not bear to do. The people of Shanxi have suffered many years of hardship and understand the Communists especially well. Therefore, the good people unconditionally oppose the Communists, and the army, government, and people cooperate seamlessly. With this factor, the Communist offensive ambitions have not yet succeeded. Yan Xishan emphasized that there is absolutely no problem with the defense of Taiyuan. Although one of the original four airfields has been lost, and three others are affected by artillery fire from time to time, two new ones have recently been opened, and another is under construction, all located in absolutely safe areas, so there is no concern about air transport. Yan Xishan also cited examples to illustrate that the Communist political offensive has also failed in Shanxi. During debates between the shouting teams on the front lines, the Communists often ran out of arguments. Recently, on the first day that 20,000 new soldiers transferred from Shandong arrived at the Taiyuan battlefield, more than 200 of them were shouted over to our side (applause). Every time the Communists launched a general offensive, artillery shells fell in the city of Taiyuan, causing deaths and injuries, but the soldiers and civilians still fought unwaveringly. Therefore, victory or defeat is one thing, and determination is another (applause). At this point, Yan Xishan used the situation when the Military Mediation Department's group was working in Shanxi as an example, pointing out that the main strategy of the Communists is deception. In fact, deceiving the enemy is a matter of course. If they do not deceive, it is their mistake; if we are deceived, it is our mistake. He stated that the Communist Party's opposition to capitalism is a position that they will never compromise on, and their cruelty in killing people without a system as a goal is a crime that cannot be concealed by clever words. The fundamental mistake of the Communist Party is in recognizing pathology but neglecting physiology, disregarding national life, and will undoubtedly fail in the end. Yan Xishan concluded his report amidst great applause. President Tong then made a brief speech, first saying that everyone's welcome was heartfelt. He then stated, "Mr. Yan is admired by the people of the whole country today, which is by no means accidental. It is the result of Mr. Yan's efforts for the people and the country for many years. Now that the national affairs are serious, Mr. Yan's strength can be described with the saying 'one knows that the pine and cypress are the last to wither only after the cold season,' making people believe that Mr. Yan will be able to use his wisdom to assist the central government, eliminate the current difficulties, and open up a new path for the country and the people." President Tong also wished Yan Xishan good health on behalf of all the colleagues in the Yuan. Then, the legislators rushed forward to shake hands with Yan Xishan and talk cordially. The enthusiasm of the situation reminded the reporter of the scene when General Fu Zuoyi attended the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang in Chongqing in February 1935 after relieving the siege of Suiyuan and Baotou. General Yan, old but vigorous, with a radiant face, eloquently reported on the military situation in Shanxi, always composed and smiling, giving people infinite confidence in the future of Taiyuan. The guests and hosts parted happily at about 5:00 pm.

### The Control Yuan Will Host Yan Xishan Today; The Next Meeting of the Yuan Will Be Postponed by One Week

### The Executive Yuan's Policy Guidelines: Will Not Be Submitted to the Legislative Yuan for Reporting for the Time Being

### The Exchange of Gold and Silver Will Be Resumed: The Banks Will Continue to Handle the Exchange When They Reopen on January 5th, and a Balancing Fee Will Be Added to the Original Funds

[Our Correspondent in Nanking, 29th] The method of exchanging gold and silver for gold yuan coupons, which has been suspended for nearly a week, was resolved to be resumed at the political affairs meeting on the 29th. It was also resolved that the exchange work will continue when the banks reopen on January 5th next year. However, as the price difference between the black market price of gold and silver and the amount of the exchange is too large, and it is not in line with the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates, it was resolved at the meeting that when the exchange is resumed, a balancing fee will be added to the original funds for the exchange. The price of the balancing fee will be quoted by the Central Bank. The calculation is based on the exchange rate difference between the Central Bank's overseas remittances on that day, calculated at a ratio of 50 US dollars to one tael of gold. The difference in the price of gold is the figure for the balancing fee. When this new method is implemented, the regulation that each person is allowed to exchange one tael of gold or 49 silver dollars every three months with an ID card will remain unchanged. At the political affairs meeting on the 29th, the political commissioners discussed this new method for a long time and decided that in order to thoroughly improve the exchange method and stabilize the overall price surge, the Ministry of Finance should jointly formulate a thorough fundamental method with the Central Bank. This method of charging a balancing fee is still a transitional measure, and the transitional method should continue to be improved after the fundamental method is formulated.

[Our Correspondent in Nanking, 29th] The bandit branch in Huaibei and the Sun Chuanjia gang have fled westward from the west side of the southern section of the Jinpu Railway towards Liu'an. After arriving at Liu'an Lihuang, they will be combined with the local Communists in that area to form a new column. The losses suffered by the Liu and Chen units in the recent Battle of Xusu can be seen from the expansion of the local Communists.

[Central News Agency, Pengbu, 29th] The Xuzhou剿總 (Suppression Headquarters) issued a communique: After the snow, it is extremely cold.

### Foreign Reporter Proves Soviet Aid to the CCP

[Associated Press, Peiping Correspondent, Jion, 29th] There is now a constant stream of evidence proving that the Soviet Union has gradually crossed the line of neutrality and is providing the Communist Party in the Northeast with opinions and aid. According to conversations with reporters returning from the Communist army lines last week, it can be confirmed that the Nanjing government spokesman's announcement on the evening of the 28th that Soviets were appearing in the Northeast was true. At the very least, the Soviets were providing technical assistance to the Communist side. Some time ago, reports were heard here that Soviet aircraft from the Lushun and Dalian bases were flying over the Shandong Peninsula and the National Army's area. The reporter overheard a conversation between two Communist political workers and obtained definite proof of the Soviets' presence in the Northeast. According to one of them, Soviet railway technicians had assisted the CCP in repairing the railways in the areas occupied by the CCP. The Communist Party member apparently did not notice that the reporter could understand part of their conversation.

Regarding the fact that non-Chinese Communist Party members are also serving in the Communist army, the reporter can prove that there are Koreans and Japanese serving in the joint affairs of the Communist army near Peiping.

Liu Shaoqi, a member of the CCP Central Committee, recently broadcasted a message, which is another proof of the closer ties between the Chinese and Soviet Communist Parties. Liu emphasized that the Chinese Communist Party is part of the world revolutionary movement. Liu also attacked the nationalistic ideas of Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito and condemned Tito for failing to understand the planned world of communism.

### The U.S. Military Advisory Group Takes Emergency Measures: No Longer Advising Military Training Work

The administrative group in Shanghai is fully dispatching the work of the advisory group. One American stated that the advisory group is determined to remain in China as much as possible. The current measures are only to prevent the occurrence of emergencies.

### Trends in the Japanese General Election

After the Japanese Parliament announced its dissolution on the 23rd, the government officially announced on the 27th that the nationwide general election in Japan would be held on January 23rd of next year. Currently, various political parties have started the candidate registration process on the 27th, and are putting forward attractive policies, preparing for various campaign arrangements before the election vote. The political parties participating in the next new parliamentary election include the Democratic Liberal Party, the Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, the Cooperative Party, and the Communist Party. Among the activities of various political parties, the Democratic Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Yoshida occupies the most advantageous position. General observation believes that the Democratic Liberal Party and its conservative forces may win the next general election, and the future regime will still belong to the conservative forces, or even tend to be more right-wing and conservative. Regarding the upcoming Japanese general election, we are unwilling to hastily make a judgment on the victory of any party or faction. We must point out how Japan's disguised democracy is flourishing and developing today, as well as its future trends.

The Japanese Parliament is divided into central and local levels. The assemblies of each prefecture are local parliamentary organizations. The central parliament is divided into the House of Councillors and the House of Representatives, which are constitutionally called the Diet. The majority of seats in the House of Representatives belongs to the first party, and the cabinet is responsible for organizing it. In practice, the cabinet mostly appears as a coalition government, and a one-party government does not violate the constitution. After the general election in April last year, the Socialist Party held the position of the first party in the House of Representatives. Later, due to the internal divisions of the Socialist and Democratic parties, the Democratic Liberal Party's camp was strengthened, and the Democratic Liberal Party jumped to become the first party in the House of Representatives. The Socialist Party was reduced to the second party, and the Democratic Party remained the third party. Other parties, such as the Cooperative Party and the Communist Party, are all minority parties in the House of Representatives, and their movements do not affect the political situation. The Democratic Liberal Party, the Socialist Party, and the Democratic Party are still more capable of dominating the political situation. Therefore, the movements of the three parties can be used as an explanation of the overall political situation.

There are a total of 466 seats in the House of Representatives. The number of candidates nominated by each party has now exceeded 2,000, especially the Democratic Liberal Party, which has nominated the most, with a total of 320 candidates. It hopes that at least 80% of them can be elected, occupying more than half of the total number of members of the House of Representatives, so as to facilitate the organization of a strong and unified conservative cabinet after the general election. The party's Secretary-General, Hirokawa, confidently said: I firmly believe that at least 250 of the 300 candidates of the Democratic Liberal Party will be elected. If the Democratic Liberal Party also occupies an advantageous position in the new parliament, the Democratic Party will support it. On the day Yoshida announced the general election period, he said very self-assuredly: In the future general election, the Democratic Liberal Party has complete confidence in winning. The government must take some measures to prevent the Communist Party from gaining an important position and destroying MacArthur's recovery plan. Secondly, the Democratic Party nominated 150 candidates, hoping to win 130 seats with the support of Yoshida. Due to the Showa, Charcoal Pipe, and Fiber three major corruption cases, the Democratic Party, like the Socialist Party, has completely lost the people's faith. Whether it can obtain ideal seats in the future depends on the relationship between the party's new president, Inukai Ken, and the Democratic Liberal Party, and on the voters' choice. The next is the Socialist Party. The party has been swaying from side to side, and its credibility has been declining in recent years. It has now nominated 167 candidates. The party's election countermeasures headquarters estimates very uncertainly that 120 people may be elected in the future. In severe cases, it will be about 90 people. Other small parties, such as the Cooperative Party and the Communist Party, have increased their candidate nominations compared to the previous election. The Cooperative Party occupies 29 seats in the House of Representatives and has now nominated 100 candidates. The Communist Party occupies 4 seats in the House of Representatives and has also nominated 100 people. This shows that the status of small parties in this general election cannot be ignored.

Based on the above analysis, we can point out the trends of this Japanese general election: (1) The conservative forces of the Democratic Liberal Party and the Democratic Party may win the general election, and the Democratic Liberal Party will steadily take the position of the first party in the House of Representatives. MacArthur's directive to accelerate Japan's economic recovery and the Christmas amnesty for 17 Japanese war criminals are clear proofs that provide significant encouragement to the conservative forces, increasing the competitiveness of the Democratic Liberal and Democratic parties; (2) If the Socialist Party does not have a left-wing coalition, it may collapse and fall behind the Democratic Party. The Cooperative and Communist parties, as they are not involved in corruption cases, may have many more votes, but they will not have a decisive or dominant force in the future parliament. In short, the general trend of the future Japanese political situation belongs to the conservative forces, and the policy is increasingly moving towards the right, inevitably gradually reviving the military system, and the trend is very clear.

### New Deployments of US Forces in the Far East: The 7th Infantry Division of South Korea Withdraws to Japan, and the 11th Air Transport Division Stationed in Japan is Ordered to Return to the United States. General-Rank Military Officers Under MacArthur are Replaced, and Military Strength is Reduced.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] According to a statement by the US Army Department today: The technical forces of the US military in the Far East will undergo a general adjustment. The 11th Air Transport Division, which was the first to enter Japan, will be ordered to return to the United States and will be replaced by the US infantry withdrawn from South Korea. The redistribution of military strength in Japan may reduce the military strength under MacArthur's command, as the entire 7th Division will not be withdrawn from South Korea to Japan. (An authoritative source told reporters: US troops will still have some presence in South Korea.) Since the 11th Division is the only air transport force of the United States in Japan, the division's return to the country will leave MacArthur without an air transport force. The Army Department previously announced that several general-rank officers, including MacArthur's chief of staff, will be summoned back to the country, and there will be other appointments. This policy will affect all general-rank officers under MacArthur's command. The adjustment of the army and the replacement of general-rank officers will reduce the military strength under MacArthur's command and take away some commanders he trusts very much.

[US Information Service, Washington, 28th] The US Army today announced plans to withdraw a portion of US troops stationed in Korea. This move by the US military is in accordance with the recent resolution of the United Nations General Assembly. According to the resolution, the occupying forces in Korea should be withdrawn as soon as possible and early.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] The total number of US troops stationed in Korea has not been officially announced recently. It is only known that it was about 30,000 in May last year. The 7th Division has 15,000 troops, so the withdrawal of the division is equivalent to reducing the number of troops stationed in South Korea by half. The Soviet occupying forces in North Korea have also begun to withdraw successively. The Soviet side announced that the withdrawal began in September and will be completed before January 1, 1949. The number of Soviet troops in North Korea is much larger than that of US troops in South Korea. In addition, North Korea has 200,000 police officers trained and equipped by the Soviet Union. The South Korean security force trained by the US military has at most 60,000 troops.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 29th] MacArthur's headquarters issued a communique today stating that the US occupation forces in South Korea have now begun to withdraw. It also stated that the withdrawal was realized after the establishment of the Republic of Korea and the United Nations decided to order the United States and the Soviet Union to withdraw their troops as soon as possible. The withdrawing US troops will be transferred to Japan to replace a certain unit that has already been transported back to the country by transport plane.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] According to reliable sources, the United States will formally recognize the South Korean government after January 1 and will simultaneously appoint President's Special Envoy Mu Xie'ao as the first US ambassador to Korea. The candidate for the Korean ambassador to the United States has not yet been announced. Although the withdrawal of the US occupation forces from Korea is being carried out according to plan, it does not mean that all US troops will be withdrawn. The remaining troops are expected to be combat troops.

[United Press, Seoul, 29th] Korean President Lee Seung-man declared today that although some US troops have withdrawn, South Korea's national defense is still very secure. I believe that our national defense forces will soon be able to do without large-scale external forces. US President's Representative to Korea Mu Xie'ao visited Lee today with Commander Corde of the 24th Army. According to Mu, Washington has not yet notified the exact date for the United States to formally recognize the Korean government, but it should be within a few days.

The Security Council, considering that this action might involve the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, which stipulates that if one party is invaded, the other should provide "immediate" assistance, led to a tense atmosphere in the meeting.

### Release Indonesian Leaders; Implement Ceasefire; Dutch Response is Ambiguous; U.S. and Soviet Representatives to the Security Council Express Dissatisfaction

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 29th Broadcast: Dutch representative Van Royen told the Security Council that the Netherlands would cease combat operations in Java no later than midnight on the 31st. However, he said that the fighting in Sumatra would not end until two or three days later due to the special circumstances there. Van Royen also said that Indonesian political prisoners would be released at the same time, but that the prisoners must cease all activities that could endanger public safety. Dutch Prime Minister Drees will travel to Indonesia in the next few days to assist in the task of rebuilding Indonesia.

Van Royen stated that the Dutch government would provide various conveniences to United Nations military observers and members of the United Nations Consular Commission so that they could compile the report required by the Security Council. British representative Farra stated that the Netherlands had somewhat met the wishes of the Security Council, but the extent to which they have done so would not be clear until early January. Soviet and U.S. representatives expressed dissatisfaction with the Dutch response. U.S. representative Jessup pointed out that the resolution passed on the 25th included two points: a ceasefire and the release of political prisoners. "The Netherlands' statement does not inform us that either of these points has been complied with." However, Jessup continued, "There is no need to propose a resolution regarding the Netherlands' non-compliance." Soviet representative Malik stated that the Netherlands dared to give such a response because they had high-level protectors on the Security Council to shield them. The refusal of Britain and the U.S. to vote for the withdrawal of Dutch troops was effectively encouraging aggressors and emboldening them to give today's response. Malik accused the British delegation of having made every effort to prevent effective action from being taken against the aggressors.

### Smooth Sailing at Municipal Council Assembly; Few Inquiries to Various Bureaus; Passed Provisional Motion to Welcome Yan Xishan's Arrival in Shanghai; Request Explanation of Taiyuan Defense to Serve as Example

[Our Dispatch] The eighth session of the first Municipal Council Assembly was held at the Council's headquarters on Tanggu Road yesterday afternoon at 3:50 PM. In attendance were Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Speaker Xu Jiyu, and a total of 129 Municipal Councilors. Also present were Mayor Wu and over thirty heads of various bureaus and departments. After the Speaker announced the opening of the meeting, the Council Secretariat first gave its report. Councilors then raised inquiries to the various bureaus, including Civil Affairs, Police, Education, Social Affairs, Land Administration, and Health. With the exception of Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian, who was absent due to illness and unable to answer, the inquiries to the other bureaus were answered by the bureau directors in turn. The Councilors' inquiries to the various bureaus were not particularly enthusiastic yesterday, and the entire inquiry process concluded in just over an hour. At around 5:00 PM, the Speaker announced a ten-minute recess, after which the meeting continued. Two provisional motions were passed: (1) Mayor's temporary proposal: Zhang Hanting, captain of the Jinyuanli motorized junk, risked his life to save people, showing great benevolence and righteousness, admired by the entire nation. It is proposed that he be awarded the Honorary Citizen Medal to show respect and encourage moral behavior. Please review this proposal. Decision: The Assembly passed the motion to award Zhang Hanting the Honorary Citizen Medal. In the future, any granting of the title of Honorary Citizen must be approved by the Municipal Council. (2) Chen Baotai, Cao Jun, Tang Chengzong, Zhou Feicheng, Cui Chonghan, Gao Shuan, Tong Hangbai, Wang Yansong, Li Wenjie, Yang Gongshu, Tian Shujun, and others proposed: General Commander Yan Xichuan defended Taiyuan with great merit, and reports state that he has arrived in Nanjing to report on his duties and expressed his firm determination to suppress the bandits, demonstrating great righteousness, admired far and wide. It is proposed that the Assembly immediately send a telegram to the capital, welcoming General Commander Yan to come to Shanghai to explain the Taiyuan defense battle to all sectors of the city, so that the capital city can learn from it. Decision: Passed. The meeting adjourned at 5:50 PM.

Small group review meetings will be held this afternoon and tomorrow morning to review the proposals submitted by the councilors. The meeting will be adjourned for New Year's Day and the 2nd of January. The third session of the eighth assembly will resume on the 3rd. The inquiries to the various bureaus and their responses are recorded below:

Inquiries to and Responses from the Civil Affairs Bureau: (1) Tong Xiang: Why is the organization and training of the People's Self-Defense Force not being actively pursued? Why is the source of those spreading rumors not being investigated? (2) Zhang Zhihan: Garrison troops in the suburbs are forcing villagers to provide food, which local people cannot afford. The Civil Affairs Bureau should find a solution. (3) Chen Peide: Regarding the issue of local garrison troops harassing the people, the Civil Affairs Bureau should present the matter to Mayor Wu and Garrison Commander Chen of the Garrison Headquarters to discuss a solution.

Director Zhang of the Civil Affairs Bureau responded: (1) The People's Self-Defense Force is experiencing financial difficulties, so its establishment is delayed. Allocating funds earlier in the next year will allow it to be established sooner. (2) Regarding the case of garrison troops requiring local food supplies mentioned by Councilors Zhang and Chen, the bureau will ask the city government to consult with the Garrison Headquarters and the Ministry of National Defense to improve soldiers' salaries and issue in-kind provisions to reduce the people's burden.

### Land Registration Welcomes "Number Calling"; Director Zhu Declares Efficiency Not Low

Inquiries to and Responses from the Land Administration Bureau: (1) Zhu Shujian: Land registration at the Land Administration Bureau is slow, and there is a "number calling" situation involving the director and section chiefs. Why is this not being improved? (2) Qu Yue: Why is land registration in the Yangjing district delayed? (3) Huang Zhensheng: The stall base of the Yuwei Peddlers' Association has been occupied. Why did the Land Administration Bureau assist the old calico guild in forcibly occupying the stall base and issue a land registration certificate?

Director Zhu Ping of the Land Administration Bureau responded: (1) The Land Administration Bureau does indeed have a "number calling" situation. This is done by publishing notices in newspapers for citizens to expedite the process, and we welcome citizens to "call numbers" publicly in the future. (2) Land registration in the Yangjing district is actively underway. I have handled 130,000 land registrations in Shanghai in the past three years, and I believe my work efficiency is not low. (3) The dispute over the stall base of the Yuwei Peddlers' Association is an old case from before the war. The former Finance Bureau and Land Administration Bureau have both issued certificates. This case will be investigated and handled after consulting with Director Tian.

### Militiaman Who Beat Refugee to Death Has Been Sent to Court for Prosecution

Inquiries to and Responses from the Police Bureau: (1) Shi Qian: How is the case of the Zhenru militiaman beating a refugee to death being handled? (2) Huang Bingquan: The Changning Road police station occupies school buildings. Why has the police bureau not thoroughly investigated and returned them? (3) Hou Junren: Police force in Zhuzhai Town should be strengthened to protect the safety of local residents.

Director Yu Shuping of the Police Bureau responded: (1) The Zhenru militiaman who beat a refugee to death has been sent to court for prosecution. The responsible branch director in that area has been dismissed. The truth of this case will definitely come to light one day. (2) We will find a way to return the school buildings occupied by the Changning Road police station. (3) Zhuzhai Town is very close to the Xin'an branch, and there have been no major cases in the past. Local security can be absolutely guaranteed.

### Education Budget for Next Year Estimated at Over 70 Million

Inquiries to and Responses from the Education Bureau: (1) Zhang Zhongyuan: Jiandong Elementary School on Tangshan Road has become completely commercialized. The principal disregards education and specializes in business, and the director of studies, Zhang Yiwu, monopolizes power, embezzling the teachers' respect-teacher bonuses and the school staff's living allowances. Why is the Education Bureau not thoroughly investigating? (2) Qu : Xinlu Normal School buildings are damaged. Why has the Education Bureau not repaired them? (3) Zhao Yangxiong: How much is the city's education budget for next year, and does it meet constitutional standards?

Director Li Ximou of the Education Bureau responded: (1) I believe it is true that Jiandong Elementary School has embezzled teachers' respect-teacher bonuses and school staff's living allowances. I have also received reports of similar cases at Minde Girls' High School and Zhaoguang Middle School in the city. These cases will be thoroughly investigated and severely dealt with. (2) The funds for repairing the Xinlu Normal School buildings have finally been received and will be repaired next year. (3) The city's education budget for next year is estimated at 77,242,599 gold yuan, accounting for 20 percent, which is not up to the constitutional standard of 35 percent. However, the city government's finances are extremely difficult, so it is difficult to make a rigid stipulation. We will try to increase it as much as possible within the possible range.

### Garbage Piles Up in Alleys; Health Bureau Promises to Find a Solution

Inquiries to and Responses from the Health Bureau: Zhu Shujian: Garbage is piled up like mountains in the alleys. Why is the Health Bureau not paying attention to cleaning it up?

Director Zhang Wei of the Health Bureau responded: The garbage pile-up is a recent phenomenon that has occurred in the past ten days. The curfew hours are hindering garbage collection, and garbage trucks are damaged and cannot be repaired due to lack of funds. We will find ways to step up our efforts in the future to maintain the cleanliness of the alleys.

Inquiries to and Responses from the Social Affairs Bureau: Tong Xiang: The "Rice-for-Cloth" case has been reported in the newspapers for a long time. What is the truth, and how should this case be handled? Please respond, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau.

Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau is on leave due to illness, so the inquiry will be answered in writing.

### Business of Four Major Department Stores Increases One to Four Times; Customers Mostly Transient Travelers; Ordinary Citizens Hesitant Due to Prices

[Our Dispatch] Amidst the recent fluctuations in prices, reporters inquired yesterday about the recent business conditions from the authorities of the four major department stores on Nanjing Road. The responses received, while not without discrepancies, generally showed an increase in turnover. On average, the increase was from one to four times compared to a week ago. Daily turnover ranged from 300,000 to 400,000 yuan to over 1 million yuan. It was said that business in department stores generally increases around Christmas and New Year's, but this year, the new wave of price increases has coincided with the influx of floating capital from the north, so the increase in turnover is indeed higher than in previous years at this time. It has been observed that many of the customers in department stores in recent days are transient travelers and soldiers from the north, and ordinary citizens, frequently affected by the price increases, are spending their remaining funds to purchase urgently needed daily necessities, but their numbers are still not many. Therefore, the frantic buying spree that occurred during the post-August 19th period has not yet been repeated. Reporters visited the major department stores yesterday and found more customers browsing than buying. The prices of most of the goods displayed in the windows have increased by 50% to 120% compared to before Christmas. However, the department store authorities do not feel interested in the price increases and increased turnover. They believe that retail stores are the first to be hit by each consecutive surge in prices. Wholesale prices can change several times a day, and can even be suspended at any time during sudden increases, but retail prices can only change once a day at most, and once prices are set, they must supply as much as possible with their existing inventory. Therefore, retail goods are in danger of being bought up when wholesale prices soar and are disconnected from retail prices. For example, the wholesale price of general cotton textiles has recently increased threefold, while the retail price in department stores has only increased by 50%. As a result, the department stores are taking a significant loss. It is also rumored that the major department stores are only selling their existing inventory and remitting the proceeds south as much as possible without approving new goods. The department store authorities have denied this. They say that the company may temporarily suspend the approval of goods when distributing year-end bonuses due to the need for large amounts of funds, but will continue to purchase goods once the bonus distribution is completed, and there is no large-scale remittance of funds to the south.

### Paying Tribute to Generals Yan and Fu; Various Circles Jointly Send Telegram Requesting Visit to Shanghai

The original telegram is recorded below: "To Minister Xu of the Ministry of National Defense in Nanjing, transfer to Director and General Yan Baichuan: General, you have defended Taiyuan and fought against the bandits, supporting the critical situation in difficult times and upholding righteousness in the face of chaos. Your great achievements are admired by all. We are overjoyed to hear that you are coming south to discuss national affairs. We respectfully request that you come to Shanghai so that we may admire your grace and receive your valuable teachings. We send this telegram to welcome you with anticipation. Shanghai Municipal Council, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, General Labor Union, Industry Association, Education Association, Farmers' Association, Women's Association, respectfully." In addition, various circles in the city have also telegraphed General Fu Zuoyi, requesting him to visit Shanghai at his convenience. The original telegram reads: "To Minister Xu of the Ministry of National Defense, transfer to Commander and General Fu Yisheng: General, you have led your troops and firmly defended Beiping and Tianjin, repeatedly defeating the stubborn bandits. Your contributions to the party and the nation are admired by all. We have heard that you are coming to Nanjing to deliberate on national affairs. To express our sincere welcome and to pay our respects and comfort, we specifically request that you visit Shanghai at your convenience to hear your advice. We await you with the utmost anticipation. Shanghai Municipal Council, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Municipal General Labor Union, Municipal Industry Association, Municipal Education Association, Municipal Farmers' Association, Municipal Women's Association, respectfully."

### The Fishing Vessel "Yukan" Lost and Sunk - Report of the Fisheries Administration on the Course of Events

[Report from our Newspaper] Chief Captain Si Songsheng and Deputy Chief Captain Liu Jingying of the Fisheries Administration hosted reporters at the Jinmen Hotel yesterday regarding the sinking of the fishing vessel "Yukan," reporting the true details of the accident and the rescue efforts. Foreign consultants Davis, Eklo, and Henkey, among others, also attended the report. Based on their combined analysis, they all believe that the "Yukan" accident was due to an unavoidable, unexpected invasion. Eklo, a highly experienced expert, believes that the loss of the vessel may have been due to damage to the fish hold door caused by the impact of water, leading to sinking, as he had learned that such a hatch board had been discovered floating near the sea area where the incident occurred. According to Chief Captain Si Songsheng of the Fisheries Administration, Davis, who has decades of navigation experience, also believes that the vessel's loss may have been due to water entering the hold after encountering a storm. Chief Captain Si emphasized that since the establishment of the Fisheries Administration, it has hired many foreign experts specifically for guidance and planning in order to expand its operations. The management and equipment of the fishing vessels have been very appropriate and careful, with no negligence or carelessness. Mr. Si also released a written report, first stating that after the "Yukan" collided with the "Yuxin" on October 15th, the bow of the "Yukan" was damaged, and it returned to Shenjiamen for repairs. It continued fishing on the 22nd and returned to Shanghai on the 27th. After inspection by the marine engineer and technicians from the repair shop, they ordered repairs. The "Yukan" went out fishing on November 2nd. At that time, there was no refusal to repair or forced fishing trip. On November 25th, the "Yukan" returned to Shanghai safely. According to the repair shop, the "Yukan" requested four repairs on the 25th and another three repairs on December 1st, all of which were completed in a timely manner. However, none of the seven items were major repairs, and the "Yukan" went out fishing again on December 2nd.

The report then described the search after the accident. It was reported that after the "Yukan" accident, the Fisheries Administration's fishing vessels stopped fishing and all participated in the search, which lasted for more than ten days. Their only hope was to find all the crew members of the "Yukan." To date, there are still people assigned to various islands and the sea area of the accident to continue the search, hoping to be worthy of the crew members and their families. As for the compensation, the administration will definitely provide it preferentially.

Requests for Repairs Completed in a Timely Manner, Search and Rescue Extended for More Than Ten Days

### Procedures for Exchange of Gold Change Again - Employees of Eight Units Disappointed, Ready to Deposit Funds but No Result

[Report from our Newspaper] A humorous episode occurred regarding the application for gold exchange by civil servants and teachers, namely that eight state-owned enterprises in this city, because they were not included in the list of civil servants for gold exchange, petitioned the Central Bank ten times. When their representatives negotiated with the Central Bank the day before yesterday, Liu Gongyun agreed to allocate 5,000 taels of gold, which would be uniformly distributed among the 17,000 employees of the eight units. At that time, most of the petitioning representatives advocated for distribution based on the unit, with equal distribution. However, the representatives of the two railway bureaus believed that the bureau had as many as 9,000 people, and if the distribution standard was based on the group, it would be unfair, so they did not agree. When the representatives went to the Central Bank again yesterday afternoon, the representatives of the railway bureau had complied with the majority. However, good things often take twists and turns. The new gold exchange procedures were passed in the afternoon, with a balancing fee to be collected in addition to the official price of gold and silver. As a result, the Central Bank stated that it must be handled in accordance with the new procedures. The representatives insisted on refusing and, with cash in hand, waited in the Central Bank conference room demanding that they be allowed to exchange at the original price. Since they still did not get their way, they left around 6 p.m. It is reported that they will continue to petition until they achieve their goal.

Encas had participants such as Kelly Robertson and Elon, who also played impressively. In the first half, Huili tightly guarded, which was quite effective. The score was tied at six points, and it was difficult to tell who was better. Huili then scored three consecutive points, suddenly taking a 12-6 lead. Encas counterattacked fiercely, taking a 24-16 lead. The first half ended with Encas leading 28 to 22. In the second half, Huili gradually improved, and the situation became a seesaw battle. Wu Chengzhang made one throw and two free throws, and Huili advanced to 45-46, only one point behind. With only 35 seconds left in the game, Cao Zhiji and Wu Chengzhang both missed their shots, which was a great pity. On the contrary, Kairosky scored, and Huili lost narrowly 45-48.

### Transshipment Restrictions Will Be Relaxed for Goods Actually Needed in Various Places - Import Quotas for Guangzhou and Taiwan Will Be Appropriately Increased Next Season

According to the Export-Import Control Committee, the general quotas for the seventh and eighth seasons have already been fully allocated. The average monthly amount of import permits issued is approximately US$5 million. However, the industrial quotas have not been fully allocated due to the failure of various manufacturers to submit the lists of quota users of their respective trade unions to the Export-Import Control Committee. It is expected that the import quotas for the ninth and tenth seasons will not be much more than the total amount of quotas allocated to various ports in the past. Because trade linkage is now being implemented, it is necessary to consider the export situation on the one hand and the amount of national foreign exchange reserves on the other hand, taking everything into account. As for the increase or decrease in the quotas for various ports, Guangzhou and Taiwan will be appropriately increased, while the north will be reduced. However, the current situation is constantly changing, and the quotas allocated to various ports in the future may not meet actual needs. Therefore, transshipment restrictions will be relaxed so that they can be adjusted to each other.

### Unusual Price Firmness - Rice Prices Rise More Sharply - Nanshi Market's Thin Rice Breaks Through 700 Yuan Barrier

Rice prices are rising more sharply. Because the price increases of other commodities are more severe than those in the rice market, and the prices in the producing area of Wuxi are close to those in Shanghai, the price firmness is unusual. The Nanshi market opened with a 100 yuan increase. Although it fell slightly in the middle of the day, it rose sharply again before closing. Thin rice has broken through the 700 yuan barrier, reaching 710 yuan, a sharp increase of 170 yuan. Special high-grade glutinous rice and Yinbaiyuan have also exceeded 700 yuan. Early white glutinous rice opened at 690 yuan, each rising by 150-160 yuan. The market continued to shout higher at closing. The increase in the Beishi market was smaller, with glutinous rice and thin rice each rising by 130 yuan. The arrival of goods yesterday was 11,263 stone.

Flour

Sharp rise continues. Yesterday's rise was even more severe. Upon hearing that rice prices were rising, the goods owners tried their best to support the prices. Old Che flour reached 350 yuan as soon as it opened, and then rose to 360 yuan. It closed at 359 yuan, a sharp increase of 96 yuan, a huge 40% increase. Bingchuan flour closed at 355 yuan, also sharply rising 96 yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng each rose sharply by about 40%. Miscellaneous brands of flour all rose by 80-90 yuan. Bran also rose sharply, with large bags of bran rising 62 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

The rise is in full swing. Initially, due to the rise in rice prices, people were optimistic, and it was difficult for goods owners to quote prices. Trading opened late, and the price increase was alarming. Hankou Zhadou reached a high price of 550 yuan, a sharp increase of 230 yuan, more than 70%. Corn was absorbed by the Qing Gang, and the goods owners tried their best to support the price. Huangdu corn reached 550 yuan, a 200 yuan increase. Red grain rose by 120 yuan. Jian Qing and Yuanmai all rose by 40-50%. Mung beans jumped even more severely. Mao mung beans opened at 700 yuan, almost doubling. Sesame rose by 400 yuan, and white sesame exceeded 1,000 yuan. Raw peanuts first rose and then fell, ultimately rising by 200-300 yuan.

Cooking Oil

Sharp rise and rapid fall, dangerous turmoil, hot speculation, with a range of 800 yuan. No one was selling at the opening, and no buyer at the closing. Soybean oil reached a maximum of 3,300 yuan, and rapeseed oil reached a maximum of 3,200 yuan. Later, Tian factories opened in large quantities, and the prices of non-industry commodities fell, causing a rapid decline of 700-800 yuan. Soybean oil closed at 2,550 yuan, rapeseed oil closed at 2,450 yuan, and Jiton rapeseed oil closed at 2,600 yuan, each rising by 200 yuan. Soybean cake was 200 yuan, with a maximum of 230 yuan, closing at 215 yuan, a 30 yuan increase.

### Food Rice, Oil, Flour Markets etc. will Close for New Year Starting Tomorrow

As the New Year is approaching, various markets in the city will be closed for the holiday. It is reported that the food rice, oil, miscellaneous grain, flour, and other markets will close early starting tomorrow and will resume red盤 trading on January 4th of next year.

### National Bank Issues 50 Yuan Banknotes, Money Supply Slightly Tightens

A spokesperson for the Central Bank said yesterday morning that, in order to facilitate industrial and commercial turnover and meet market needs, the bank has begun issuing a new denomination of 50 yuan banknotes. These banknotes are printed by the Central Printing Plant, with the front and back being lithographic, in a blue-green color.

Yesterday, the loose money supply in the city slightly tightened. Commodity prices rose across the board, and there was an urgent need from all parties. The authorities sold yarn and cloth, withdrawing tens of millions of yuan in currency. The search for orders outside the industry was very strong. Although foreign funds continued to seep in, the market interest rate had risen to 18 yuan or 20 yuan, with the highest being 22 yuan. The New Year's head money was done at 25 yuan yesterday. Cash筹码was still flat. It is rumored that the Central Bank intends to contract the money supply by at least 500 million yuan in the next few days.

### Influx of Funds from North and South into the City - Authorities Considering Limiting Remittances

According to financial authorities, the amount of floating funds circulating in the city is estimated to be more than one billion yuan, and funds from various places have continued to flow in recently. They pointed out that the source of these funds is not only North China, but also funds from South China, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou have recently flowed back to Shanghai in large quantities. The reason for this is that commodity prices in the city were stable in the previous period. They also hinted that the authorities may consider limiting remittances to Shanghai in order to control this flood. In the current situation, relying solely on the sale of materials is not enough to achieve the immediate effect of tightening the money supply. For example, on the 28th, the currency recovered by the government from the sale of yarn and cloth was approximately 38 million yuan, while the floating funds concentrated in the market exceeded 400 million.

### Various Businesses Should Apply for and Transfer Increased Capital in Cash on Schedule

The total amount to be transferred is approximately 7,500,000 Yuan

Regarding the increased capital of commercial businesses, the issue of cash transfer is still in a state of high importance. As of yesterday morning, the Central Bank had not yet received any transfer applications from businesses. According to bank personnel, if businesses fail to apply for transfer by the 31st, and the Ministry of Finance does not issue any extensions or alternative measures, the financial regulatory authorities have the right to revoke their business licenses based on the announced regulations. However, they believe that although the time is very tight, this issue will surely be resolved before the deadline.

Furthermore, according to estimates from the National Bank, the total amount of cash to be transferred for the increased capital of commercial businesses in this city is approximately 7.5 million Yuan.

### Foreign Exchange Certificate Prices Soar

The exchange rate for overseas remittances was raised for the twelfth time yesterday, reaching 100 Gold Yuan per US dollar, an increase of eight Yuan compared to the previous rate. The foreign exchange transfer certificate opened sharply in the morning, surging to 128 to 129 Yuan. Later, upon hearing that the black market price of gold banknotes had jumped, various groups vigorously competed to buy, and the price rose again to 130 Yuan. Subsequently, exporters took profits at the high price, and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications secretly sold off large quantities, causing the price to trend downward. At the close of the market, the transaction price for designated banks was 115 Yuan for buying and 116 Yuan for selling.

### Tea Market Permeated with Buying Sentiment

The tea market opened yesterday with reports of sharp price increases for goods outside the industry, stirring up sentiment. Holders of goods, fearing they would not be able to replenish their stock once sold, were reluctant to part with them, leading to a situation of demand exceeding supply and few transactions. Prices rose in a straight line. Subsequently, as prices for various goods outside the industry uniformly declined, holders became slightly more willing to sell red and green tea, and the volume of transactions gradually increased. However, domestic sales of fancy teas continued to be dominated by buying sentiment, with transactions being particularly active in this street and elsewhere. As for export case tea, the shipping schedule was still far off, and exporters remained relatively inactive, with only sporadic transactions.

### Sugar Prices Skyrocket

The sugar market continued to rise yesterday. Despite the strong upward trend in recent days, sentiment remained strong. The opening trend for various firms was relatively stable, but upon hearing that prices for various goods outside the industry had risen again, spreading bullish sentiment, local firms took the lead in adding to their holdings, driving up prices. The market shifted from stability to strength, with more demand than supply, leading to chaotic price increases.

No. 45 grade white refined sugar opened at 1300 Yuan in the morning, and after opening, there was a chorus of buying. Holders pushed prices higher, soaring by 200 Yuan in an instant. Subsequently, prices fluctuated between 1460 Yuan and 1480 Yuan, with few sellers, leading to the close of the market, up 430 Yuan.

Coarse sugar opened at a low price of 960 Yuan and rose all the way, reaching a high of 1380 Yuan at the close. Prices for other types of sugar rose correspondingly, with the exception of Xinghua red sugar, which did not see any transactions.

### Tung Oil Initially Strong, Then Retreated

Yesterday's tung oil market inherited the continuous upward trend of recent days. Due to the strong position of foreign exchange transfer certificates and the sharp rise in prices for various goods outside the industry, sentiment was remarkably strong, and sellers shouted out prices in leaps and bounds. The market continued its upward trajectory, and prices became even more astonishing. Fully weighted white oil and green oil both reached 1450 Yuan per dan. However, towards noon, the market suddenly became unsustainable and gradually declined, due to tighter credit and a reversal in the prices of various goods. Those who were wary of holding at high prices also began to sell, and the market atmosphere softened. However, prices were still much higher than the previous day's settlement.

### Holders Vigorously Pushing Up Prices, Cotton Cloth Prices Soar in a Straight Line, Dragon Head Fine Cloth Reaches a High of 1350 Yuan

The rise in cotton yarn prices was like a raging fire. With frequent reports of favorable buying sentiment and a uniform surge in prices for various goods outside the industry, sentiment became increasingly bullish. Retail investors were eagerly buying, and holders vigorously pushed up prices, causing prices to soar in a straight line.

42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 48,300 Yuan in the morning and closed at 40,000 Yuan in the afternoon. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose and then retreated, ultimately closing at 38,500 Yuan, up 3,200 Yuan. 32-count Silver Moon initially opened at a peak of 40,000 Yuan, eventually retreating slightly to 32,000 Yuan, ultimately holding at 000 Yuan.

Factory orders were at 27,500 Yuan, also up 1,000 Yuan. 20-count Double Horse fell from 30,000 Yuan to close at 25,500, up 1,200 Yuan. 16-count yarn was transacted outside the 20,000 Yuan mark, and 10-count Boy Scout also broke the 20,000 Yuan barrier.

Yesterday, cotton cloth sparked an astonishing surge. The market was filled with buying orders, and holders refused to sell, leading to chaotic price bidding. Large holders raised prices and absorbed goods. Dragon Head fine cloth broke the 1,000 Yuan mark as soon as it opened, reaching a new high of 1,180 Yuan, causing holders to be unwilling to sell, resulting in a situation of demand exceeding supply. Prices then increased to 1,245 Yuan before some sellers offered a small amount of goods. The price eventually reached a peak of 1,350 Yuan. Before the close, holders took profits by selling, and the price fell back to 1,160 Yuan at the close, resulting in a massive jump of 300 Yuan compared to the previous day. Middle-grade fine cloth was initially transacted at a high of 1,245 Yuan, but there were no transactions after that.

Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge initially opened at 1,100 Yuan. Although it briefly rose to 1,260 Yuan during the day, it ultimately closed at 1,100 Yuan, a surge of 260 Yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong ultimately traded at 1,150 Yuan, a sharp increase of 310 Yuan. In the afternoon, sentiment was reportedly weaker, and various cloths became sluggish.
