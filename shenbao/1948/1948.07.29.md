### President Weng's Announcement to the Nation: Discern Right from Wrong and Overcome National Crisis Together; The Chinese Communists Are Indeed Controlled by the Communist International

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Premier Weng Wenhao has issued a letter to the nation, titled "Discern Right from Wrong and Overcome National Crisis Together." The full text is as follows:

Our country is suffering from the destruction and disturbances caused by the Chinese Communists. The Central Government originally hoped to negotiate sincerely and compromise painstakingly in order to avoid the use of force. Unfortunately, the Chinese Communists stubbornly adhere to their prejudices, unwilling to embark on the path of constitutionalism, and are determined to expand their troops, seize local power, disrupt social order, and devastate the lives and property of the people, resulting in a dangerous situation that shakes the foundation of the nation. For the sake of consolidating the foundation of the nation and protecting the people, the government has been forced to decide to implement suppression of the rebellion in order to quell the bandits who betray the country.

Those who follow the Communist Party are originally Chinese people, and their love for the country and their intentions as good citizens should be the same. What is unfortunate is that these people are coerced by the power of the Chinese Communist bandits, forced to embark on the wrong path, and jointly engage in activities that endanger the country and harm the people. Therefore, all actions should be the responsibility of the Chinese Communist bandits. Why do the Chinese Communists insist on endangering the country and harming the people? It is because the Chinese Communists are part of the world communist movement. Every action and every propaganda of the Chinese Communists is based on the opinions of the Communist International, and is always consistent without the slightest difference. This can be fully demonstrated by the resolution issued by the Chinese Communists on the 10th of this month to accept the punishment of the Yugoslav Communist Party by the Communist International Information Bureau.

The so-called Communist International Information Bureau was established by representatives of communist parties from nine European countries at a meeting held in Warsaw, Poland, in late September last year. The original address of the bureau was in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia. On October 5th, they jointly issued a declaration accusing the United States, Britain, and France of being aggressor countries, and demanded that communist countries be responsible for protecting the territory and sovereignty of other countries. They also recognized that US aid to Western Europe, South America, and China was evidence of aggression against other countries, and that communist countries must thoroughly break down this type of work. In the summer of this year, the US Congress decided on various foreign aid measures. Communist representatives from eight European countries met again in Warsaw to discuss methods of attacking and undermining US aid. At the same time, they condemned and announced the crimes of the Yugoslav Communists and formally expelled the Yugoslav Communist Party from the party. This kind of behavior by the European Communist International was originally aimed at Europe and did not mention China. However, the Chinese Communists echoed in unison and issued a statement on July 10th, severely criticizing the Yugoslav Communists and ordering the bandit cadres to "seriously study the resolution of the Communist International Information Bureau on the Yugoslav Communist issue, in order to strengthen the party's education on class, party, and internationalist self-criticism, spirit, and discipline." This kind of unanimous response proves that the Chinese Communists are indeed under the control of another central force of the Communist International.

We know that the Chinese Communists use harsh reviews and brutal purges as means of execution for the "education" and "self-criticism" of their party members. Moreover, the Chinese Communists' resolution clarifies discipline, which shows that this review and purge will be extremely harsh and cruel in order to eradicate the only remaining thread of national consciousness within the party and not allow the slightest residue to remain. Originally, the Chinese Communist Party was already a branch of the Communist International. Its party members must be loyal to the Communist International and carry out the orders of the Communist International. This was already clearly stipulated in its party constitution and the Communist Party oath of its members. Therefore, it is not surprising that the bandit party accepted the Communist International's condemnation of the Yugoslav Communists and took this opportunity to deepen the discipline of controlling party members.

### The Critical Moment of Survival as Masters or Slaves: No Room for Hesitation or Doubt; The Bandits' Endangering of the Country and Harming of the People Has Solid Proof

The Communist International Information Bureau condemned the Yugoslav Communists and pointed out several crimes, which further confirmed that many slogans of the Communist Party are shameless deceptions. The first crime of the Yugoslav Communists is to promote nationalism. Since the Chinese Communists have accepted this decision, they have fundamentally negated nationalism. The second crime of the Yugoslav Communists is to allow representatives of the petty bourgeoisie and farmers and workers to represent the whole country, replacing the one-party dictatorship of the Communist Party. Since the Chinese Communists have accepted this decision, it can be seen that their call for a "democratic coalition government" is just a smokescreen for their political conspiracy. The third crime of the Yugoslav Communists is to allow private ownership of land and allow people to buy and sell land. Since the Chinese Communists have accepted this decision, it can be seen that their propaganda of appeasing rich peasants and stabilizing middle peasants has become an empty slogan and is actually unreliable. The fourth crime of the Yugoslav Communists is that individual economy is widespread throughout the country. Since the Chinese Communists have accepted this decision, it can be seen that the Communist Party's claim to protect urban industry and commerce is a shameless deception. From this, it can be seen that the actual policy of the Communist International conflicts with the propaganda slogans used by the Chinese Communists. It is precisely using the spear of the son to attack the shield of the son. Its hypocrisy is very obvious. If the Chinese Communists' so-called patriotism and national united front are true, they should never have accepted the Communist International's condemnation of the Yugoslav Communists. Since they have accepted it, it can be seen that the slogans flaunted by the Chinese Communists are purely intentional deception and are absolutely not to be believed.

We should take this opportunity to truly recognize that this behavior of the Chinese Communists is a completely unreserved manifestation of the bandit party's international espionage, and it is also the most solid proof of the bandit party's endangering the country and harming the people. Since we have thoroughly recognized the nature and ambition of this international armed fifth column, then striving to prevent and defend against it is our greatest responsibility and must not be lightly abandoned. At this critical moment of survival as masters or slaves, there is absolutely no room for ambiguity, hesitation, or doubt for the people of the whole country.

Sun Yat-sen said: "Nationalism is the doctrine of the nation." He also said: "We, in view of the reasons for the survival of clans in ancient and modern times, want to save China and want the Chinese nation to exist forever, we must promote nationalism." The nation is created by natural forces. Human nature has a deep foundation. Our Chinese nation has been established in East Asia and has a long history and a historically unchanging spirit. It relies on the deep-rooted national righteousness in the hearts of the people and cannot be shaken by foreign violence and heresies. In the past hundred years, China has been bound by unequal treaties due to the decadence of the imperial system. In the past fifty years, the invasion and occupation of land by Japanese warlords has further stimulated the national sentiments of our compatriots and strengthened the national consciousness of our compatriots, leading to a movement to save the nation. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen and the patriotic people of the whole country advocated the National Revolution to fight for the freedom and equality of China. The righteousness trended and compatriots at home and abroad followed suit. President Chiang Kai-shek inherited Sun Yat-sen's legacy and led the Northern Expedition to unify the country and resolutely resisted the war against Japan, recovering the lost land of the past fifty years, such as canceling the unequal treaties of the past one hundred years. Every step is aimed at the freedom, equality, unification, and independence of China. The facts are obvious and should be known to all the people of the country.

After the victorious end of the War of Resistance against Japan, the National Government resolutely convened the National Assembly, formulated a democratic constitution, and established a democratically elected government, striving to move forward towards the goals of government of the people, by the people, and for the people. If there were no disturbances from the Communist bandits and the suppression of the rebellion, the election methods and constitutional scale would naturally be more perfect.

However, looking at the past actions of the Communist Party, they have always had the purpose of seeking private gain. The party knew early on that the national spirit of our compatriots was a force that could not be easily insulted, so it had to use various slogans to conceal the nature of its Communist International branch and fifth column. Therefore, during the Northern Expedition of our National Revolutionary Army, it superficially advocated overthrowing imperialism, but actually obstructed the Northern Expedition in every possible way, and then divided the camp of the National Revolution. After the establishment of the National Government and the unification of national power, the Chinese Communists even established independent governments in southern Jiangxi and northern Shaanxi, dividing the territory and establishing themselves as heroes. During the full-scale war of resistance, the Communist bandits claimed to participate in the war of resistance, but in reality, they used this to expand their military force and prepare their plans to resist the government. When the war of resistance ended, the Communist Party's goal was primarily to seize Japanese weapons and establish liberation areas separate from the government, while obstructing the National Assembly and opposing the democratic constitution in order to prevent the progress of constitutionalism. It can be seen that from the beginning of its founding to the present day, the Chinese Communist Party has never abandoned its ambition to overthrow the government and split the country. In fact, its methods have always been extremely authoritarian and dictatorial, and its so-called new democracy is completely contradictory and inconsistent. Its propaganda is even more deceptive, divisive, and lacking in faith and truth. Its so-called self-criticism and discipline are clearly tools for oppressing party members. Therefore, comparing each other, the Chinese Communist Party's disregard for the country and its ulterior motives have always been obvious and clear.

### The Government's Suppression of Bandits and Rebellion Is Not a Party Dispute, Nor Is It a Civil War; Those Who Abandon the Bandits and Return Will Be Accommodated and Supported

Therefore, we feel deeply sorry for the good people who have been deceived by the Communist Party and have joined it, only to be strictly controlled and abandon their motherland. For this reason, we also advise the people of the whole country to fully recognize that the Communist Party is indeed an affiliated organization of the Communist International and is indeed the source of danger to the country and the people. They must be cautious and vigilant, and must not be tempted by their false words and heresies.

At this time when the international conspiracy of the bandit party is fully exposed, it is the day when the people who have mistakenly joined the Communist Party and still have conscience should urgently seek to extricate themselves and return. All compatriots who do not want to be slaves and are unwilling to be traitors are people that the country should cherish and the people should support. Regardless of whether they have fought against the National Army in the past or have been enemies with their villages, as long as they abandon the bandit party and resolutely return, the government will definitely accommodate and protect them, and under the constitution, work together to save and build the country.

The government also wants to clearly tell people from all walks of life in society that the suppression of bandits and rebellion is not a party dispute, nor is it a civil war. It is because the Chinese Communist Party is indeed affiliated with the Communist International, selling out national sovereignty, and destroying the rights of the people. The government and patriotic compatriots throughout the country cannot but work together to quell it in order to preserve the foundation of the country. The declaration issued by the communist parties of nine European countries last year clearly stated that their goal is to undermine the effectiveness of US aid to other countries. The Chinese Communist Party, of course, adopted the same policy. Therefore, just when the US Congress decided on the aid to China plan and US aid to China officials were about to come to China, the Chinese Communist Party instigated anti-American sentiment in various schools, claiming to advocate it, but in reality, it was purely a performance of the Communist Party's world policy in our country. Under the revelation of such obvious and experimental facts, we deeply hope that the people of the whole country can clearly distinguish between good and evil and work together towards the correct direction of saving and building the country.

### The President Climbs to a High Place for a Scenic View: He is Extremely Pleased with the Distant View of Taihu Lake and the Qiantang River; It Was Hot and Dry in the Mountains Yesterday; He Read Books at the Official Residence in the Afternoon

[This newspaper, Moganshan, 28th] The President got up at 6 o'clock this morning, dressed in casual clothes for a walk, and inquired about the well-being of his neighbors. At about 9 o'clock, Wang Zhengyi, Director of the Administration Bureau, and Zhou Xiangxian, Mayor of Hangzhou, walked to Luhua Dang and waited for an audience there. Many people who came to admire his demeanor bowed and paid their respects. The President replied, "Good, good." He then went to the residence of Huang Yingbai at No. 509, and inquired about the housekeeper of Huang's wife for a long time. Before leaving, he ordered his entourage to give the housekeeper a reward of 3 million yuan. Then the President turned to the intersection of Yinshan Street and climbed to the highest peak of Mogan Mountain, Tashan. He said that he took a rattan sedan chair to the entrance of Tashan Park and walked uphill, leaving the sedan chair. At this time, the sun had not yet risen to the top of the mountain. The President looked out over Taihu Lake and the Qiantang River from the mountain, and looked quite pleased. After about fifteen minutes, he returned to the official residence along the original road. At noon, after a nap, the President read books in a rattan chair at the official residence and did not go out. After dinner, he enjoyed the evening scenery on the lawn in front of the door.

[Central News Agency, Moganshan, 28th] President Chiang and his wife are staying in the mountains for a short time. He is in good health and in a pleasant mood. He is very interested in the beautiful natural environment of Moganshan. At 9 a.m. on the 28th, the President, accompanied by Director of the Bureau and Mayor Xiangxian, visited Luhua Dang, another scenic spot in Mogan Mountain. The President was wearing a summer cloth long shirt and a cork hat, and walked slowly in the mountains with a cane. All was quiet, except for the sound of birds and cicadas, as if welcoming the head of state who was devoted to the country. On the way, he visited Jingyi Villa, the residence of the party and state elder Zhang Jingjiang, and rested for a while. Then he followed the mountain road to visit the former residence of his old friend Huang Yingbai. The President sat here for a while and boiled Luhua Dang spring water to cool off the heat. After a while, he left and went straight to Luhua Dang. A bay of streams was clear and could be used as a mirror. Tourists cheered when they saw the President's arrival. The President nodded frequently in response. At about 10 o'clock, he climbed to Tashan, the summit of Mogan Mountain. Tashan rises 2,500 feet above sea level and can overlook the Qiantang River to the east and Tianmu Mountain to the west. The President climbed to a high place and looked into the distance, taking in the beautiful rivers and mountains. He lingered for a long time before slowly descending the mountain with his cane. On the way back, he saw a policeman on the side of the road. The President stopped and asked the policeman where he was from and whether the salary he received was enough to keep him warm and fed. His concern was evident in his words. He returned to the official residence for rest at 11 o'clock. It was hot and dry in the mountains today. The President did not travel in the afternoon and read books in the official residence.

### Zhang Zhaoyuan Expresses His Thoughts on the Achievements of the First Session of the Legislative Yuan; The Loyalty and Devotion of All Committee Members Is Truly Admirable

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Zhang Zhaoyuan, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, recently made a statement on his thoughts on the first session of the Legislative Yuan. He said: "This first session of the Legislative Yuan under the constitution can be said to be the first chapter in the beginning of democratic politics. The scale of the achievements is beyond expectations. I can prove it with facts. From the opening of the meeting on May 8 to the adjournment on July 24, it lasted only two and a half months. A total of 61 cases have been concluded, including 9 legal cases, 3 financial cases, 3 budget cases, 2 treaty cases, 2 consent cases, and 2 other cases submitted by the government. A total of 12 legal cases and 18 other cases were submitted by various committee members. 10 cases concerned the Yuan itself. In addition, there are 95 cases still under review, including 38 legal cases, 1 financial case, and 3 treaty cases submitted by the government. 7 legal cases, 14 financial cases, and 32 other cases were submitted by various committee members. In this short period of time, the initial progress was slow due to the beginning of the meeting, the efficiency increased in the middle, and the progress in the final stage was in order after the organization of the Program Committee, which was no less than the parliament of any advanced country. In the meantime, there may be some twists and turns and wasting of time, but the British and American parliaments have today's results, which are the beautiful fruits of hundreds of years of painful experience. It is inevitable that the first session of our Legislative Yuan will be overly criticized if we expect it to be like the current state of the British and American parliaments. What is most admirable is that, no matter how much the 700-odd legislators debated, their loyalty and devotion to the country were exactly the same. During voting, they based their decisions on gains and losses and showed full rationality. During the session, they defied the heat and worked hard, reviewed budget bills and legal bills late into the night. After the adjournment, various committees continued to review the unfinished cases submitted by the Yuan with the committee members and conveners staying in Beijing, so that they could be submitted for discussion in the second session in a timely manner. This kind of request fully demonstrates that the committee members are able to live up to the trust of the people. Regarding the administrative aspects, I took office on May 18. The government had no material preparation, and I was unable to prepare before taking office. Therefore, office space, committee member housing, transportation, and expenses were all problems that were not easy to solve at the time. The colleagues of the Secretariat worked tirelessly day and night. Their spirit of trying to overcome difficulties is also worthy of recollection, and the committee members are mostly rich in administrative experience, and can understand some of the imperfect factors in the consultation, which makes me even more encouraged."

### Lu Establishes a People's Salvation Pioneer Team

### Celebrating the Opening of the World Games

At a time when all of humanity is trapped in the horror of war, the Fourteenth World Games solemnly opens in London today. This Olympic gathering, held in the revitalized capital of Britain, is grand in scale, with 61 participating countries and a total of 6,118 athletes. No other sporting event can compare to the solemnity and greatness of this one. The planned opening ceremony today will begin with a parade of delegations from each country, carrying their national flags and nameplates, to be reviewed by the British monarch. After the monarch declares the start of the Olympic Games, bugles will sound, cannons will fire, and relay runners carrying the torch will enter the Empire Stadium. The Olympic flag-raising ceremony will see the bright flag raised amidst the sound of bugles, and over a thousand silver pigeons will take flight, signaling to the world that the Olympic Games have begun. The Olympic Games are a symbol of peace, unity, democracy, and progress. The historical significance they bring is infinitely sacred, infinitely bright, and infinitely great. We sing hymns of praise, welcoming the opening of the World Games, and we pray that the atmosphere of Olympic harmony will spread and flourish.

The Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece and made a great contribution to maintaining the relations between Greek city-states and training the martial spirit of the Greeks. Its origins are difficult to verify. A more reliable explanation is that ancient Greece had four important festivals, one of which was called the Olympic Games, which was specially used to commemorate the god of the sky, the father of all gods and mankind. At that time, only those of pure Greek descent could participate in the games. After Greece was conquered by Rome, Romans also had the right to participate. In the first thirteen Olympic Games, the only competition event was racing. Later, it gradually increased to 24 events, including short and long-distance races, wrestling, boxing, chariot races, horse races, and armored races. The past Olympic Games had a strong atmosphere of peace. Every time the meeting was held, a large number of silver pigeons would be released to fly to the warring city-states to announce the opening of the meeting and call on the belligerents to immediately cease fighting. This kind of religious and divine influence once took effect in a very short process. Over time, the authority of the warring parties did not accept its influence. In 490 BC, during the Battle of Marathon, the Athenian army fought on the front line. The warrior Phidippides returned south to report the victory and later became a famous "Marathon" in sports, which symbolized the disappearance of the meaning of peace. Therefore, it is said that the peace meaning of the Olympics is only symbolic and unattainable.

At the same time, the ancient Greek Olympic Games were also a comprehensive expression of religion, art, politics, and social movements. The "sportsmanship" cultivated on the sports field gradually penetrated the blood of Greek culture. As a result, the Aegean Sea, the cradle of ancient civilization, was filled with self-confidence, vigor, democracy, and the glory of progress. This glory has brought infinite happiness to later generations. Unfortunately, the Olympic Games, which began in 776 BC, were forcibly stopped by Roman Emperor Theodosius I in 394 AD after being held for 293 sessions. This was the dark age of mankind. It was not until April 6, 1896, that the first World Games after Easter was announced in Athens. Mankind once again embarked on the road of peace and unity. Since then, it has been held every four or two years, convened in different countries. The sixth World Games should have been held in 1916, but unfortunately it was stopped due to World War I. The seventh session was held in Antwerp in 1920. The most noteworthy thing is the eleventh session held in Berlin in 1936, which was also the last session before this (fourteenth) session, and formally restored the "Olympic Flame", burning brightly. The twelfth session was originally scheduled to be held in Tokyo in 1940, but because Japan launched the war of aggression against China, and then in 1939, fires spread all over Europe, and the twelfth World Games was stopped. The Second World War was in progress in 1944, so the thirteenth World Games was also announced to be postponed.

Now, three years after the end of the war, people are welcoming the Fourteenth World Games with joy. In today's world, despite the "Cold War" of great power politics manifested in every corner of the world, and the Chinese and Greek people are even more trapped in dire straits, mankind is always moving in the direction of progress, calling for peace, demanding stability, fighting for democracy, and heading for freedom. An Olympic Games, a symbol of peace, may be valued by the people of the world today because it values its sacred meaning, brightness and greatness, peace and stability. We Chinese people are living in an era of suffering today; our reason demands brightness, we wish the "Olympic Flame" to burn and radiate brilliance, bringing happiness to those who suffer; we wish to see silver pigeons flying over our vast land, bringing good news. We also wish that from now on, the torch of light will drive away the demons of killing; our Yangtze River and Yellow River, our Black Water and White Water, will be covered with bright flowers and happy fruits.

We welcome the arrival of the World Games, we cheer and sing: Peace! Freedom! Democracy! Progress! We congratulate the athletes of the Chinese delegation for their happiness and health. Today we will raise the great flag of the Republic of China, the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth, parading before all countries, all races, and all peoples, gaining cheers and sympathy. We do not necessarily need to compete for championships, we only need justice and righteousness, civilization and glory! We celebrate the opening of the Fourteenth Olympic Games in solemn splendor, and we celebrate the arrival of the modern era. We cheer! We sing!

However, its business is entrusted to the Shanxi Province Relief Material Purchase and Transportation Office. Therefore, air transport is also of a chartered nature, resulting in passenger ticket prices being much higher than the current prices in general. The team stipulates that each plane carries 35 passengers. Since the 22nd, the freight for each plane on the Pingbing Line has been 3,326.4 million yuan, and the average ticket price is 95.6 million yuan.

### Leibhahn's Remarks in Beiping; US Aid Not Biased; Leibhahn Scheduled to Fly to Taiyuan for Inspection

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] Leibhahn visited Li Zongren at 10:30 AM on the 28th and discussed for one hour. After the meeting, Li told reporters: "I exchanged views on the use of US aid. I told him to pay attention to the urgent need for US aid in the North and not to be biased towards the North. Leibhahn fully agreed with my opinion."

[Local News] China Airlines will send a passenger plane early tomorrow (29th) morning to carry Leibhahn and his party, who are the executors of US aid, from Ping to Taiyuan for inspection. It is expected that they will stay in Bing briefly. If time permits, they will fly to Shenyang by the original plane and fly back to Beiping from Shenyang on the 30th.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 28th] Leibhahn stated again at a press conference in Ping on the 28th that US aid is not biased and that they have never ignored the importance of the North in military and economic aspects. After explaining the preliminary plan for the distribution of US aid, Leibhahn continued: The core of the US aid problem is how to properly allocate and rationally use it. The final report of the Steelman Investigation Team is expected to be drafted next month for Director Hoffman to make the final decision. He also said: The allocation of US aid is difficult, so the temporarily formulated principles will inevitably have more or less revisions during implementation. After Leibhahn finished speaking, he also answered reporters' questions, saying: (1) The use of US aid will never be concentrated in one place, and the Steelman report cannot be regarded as an immutable decision. (2) Aid to Europe and aid to China are equally important militarily. World peace is indivisible. Americans have a deeper understanding of Europe due to travel or historical relationships, but they have not ignored the East. (3) The Chinese government is in a difficult situation and may not be satisfactory in some respects, but the Agency will cooperate with it to revive China. (4) China is an old country with a long history and culture. It will take many changes to achieve the ideal of reform. Therefore, we should not expect to see any progress by April 3 next year. Leibhahn also said: He was very impressed after inspecting Tianjin.

### Iron Ore Exchanged for Japanese Machinery: I Will Resume Negotiations with the Allied Headquarters

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] My representative from the Resources Committee stationed in Japan will soon resume negotiations with the Allied Headquarters to sell one million tons of iron ore, currently valued at US$7 million, to Japan in exchange for steel manufacturing machinery. Since most steel factories in the Northeast and North China have been destroyed by the Communist bandits, it is widely known that our country is currently in dire need of such machinery. The few remaining parts also urgently need repair and replacement. The million tons of iron ore that I intend to sell to Japan will be produced in Daye and Ma'anshan. It is understood that the sales method may be retail or a single contract for bulk sales, which has not yet been determined. However, the price will be determined with reference to the iron price in the Great Lakes region of the United States. As for the quantity of steel manufacturing machinery that Japan can use to exchange with me, it still needs to be calculated. Furthermore, Allied Headquarters reported that a Shanghai company signed a contract with Japan on July 17 to export 200,000 tons of iron ore to Japan, which is expected to start arriving in Japan after September 25. The contract also stipulates that the company will be fined if there are delays in delivery.

### U.S., British, and French Ambassadors to Meet with Molotov Today, Presenting a Joint New Note, Hoping to Facilitate Four-Power Negotiations on the German Question

[United Press, London, 28th] U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, has departed for Moscow by special plane this evening and is expected to arrive in Moscow on the 29th. Smith's special plane stopped briefly in Berlin at midnight.

Another dispatch: Roberts, the private secretary to British Foreign Secretary Bevin, left London on the 28th for Moscow, together with representatives from the U.S. and France, to deliver the Western response to the Kremlin. Roberts, who was originally the British Minister to the Soviet Union, will fly to Berlin on the same plane as General Robertson, the British military commander in Germany, and then fly to Moscow with U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, General Smith.

[United Press, London, 28th] According to authoritative sources, the U.S., French, and British ambassadors to the Soviet Union will inform Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in Moscow on the 29th of the decision made at the London Conference regarding relations with the Soviet Union. They will place the biggest bet since the end of the war, which could be for peace or war, but not necessarily immediate peace or immediate war. However, they also said that this new negotiation with the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union's response could be a turning point for the situation to improve or worsen. This oral note was handled with extreme caution and long preparation beforehand. The various departments of the U.S. government have never paid so much attention to diplomatic action before. It is generally expected that the U.S., British, and French ambassadors will frankly tell Molotov that their governments are prepared to begin negotiations with the Soviet Union on the German question as soon as the Berlin blockade is lifted. This negotiation does not mean that a four-power foreign ministers' conference will be convened immediately, as the preparatory work for a four-power foreign ministers' conference will take a long time. It is generally expected that the Western powers will first suggest negotiations through normal diplomatic channels and the Allied Control Council for Germany.

[United Press, London, 28th] Authoritative sources said that Smith will make oral representations to Molotov on behalf of the U.S., Britain, and France, pointing out that the Berlin blockade violates Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, which states that "Members of the United Nations shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered." This is the decision reached at the London Conference of the U.S., Britain, and France. There is no doubt that the Western powers have reached an agreement and may finally agree to convene a four-power conference or refer the Berlin issue to the United Nations, but at this stage, the Western powers have agreed to delay any action that could lead to the reopening of the four-power foreign ministers' conference or an appeal to the United Nations.

[This newspaper] Geneva, 28th broadcast: Washington dispatch: Marshall told reporters that the United States has reached an agreement with Britain and France on the Berlin issue but refused to disclose the contents of this agreement. At the same time, he was unwilling to confirm or deny whether the three governments had instructed their ambassadors to the Soviet Union to discuss the Berlin situation directly with Molotov.

### Republicans Attempt to Attack Truman, Decide to Adopt Delaying Tactics, Plan to Request Congress to Adjourn, Making the Plan Fail

[United Press, Washington, 27th] The special session of the U.S. Congress convened by President Truman to establish anti-inflation legislation was attacked by Truman on the 27th, as Republican leaders accused Truman's plan of having political purposes and launched an offensive to quickly adjourn the meeting. In fact, they will make Truman's hopes for all his demands to vanish. After discussing Truman's plan by telephone with the Republican presidential candidate Dewey, the Republican leaders agreed to consider Truman's plan. But they made it clear that they did not intend to turn any of these plans into legislation and said that they planned to stop the meeting and return home in two weeks.

In addition, they will put the anti-poll tax bill passed by the House of Representatives on the first item of discussion on the Senate agenda, thus setting up a huge obstacle in the way of any action. At the same time, Democratic Senator Johnston (South Carolina) has prepared to propose an adjournment, and he is the leader of the Democratic rebellious senators in the eleven southern states who oppose Truman's demands for racial rights. After the Republican leaders held a strategy meeting, they replied with a policy declaration of more than a thousand words, denouncing the president's convening of the special conference as a political means to seek re-election as president. They accused the Democratic government of being responsible for the current high prices and stated that they were willing to hand over the matter to the people of the whole country to decide in the November election. Truman had previously told the hostile Congress that Congress must stop inflation, otherwise, it would bear the brunt of the unpopular tragedy. He demanded the rapid passage of the collection of excessive profit tax, the restriction of wages and prices, the power to assign the distribution system, and other measures to "stop the rising prices."

[United States News Agency, Belgrade, 27th] The first Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, Kardelj, told the Communist Party Congress here on Monday that Yugoslavia advocates economic cooperation with all countries in the world on an equal footing.

It is said that Tito told Olson that Yugoslavia is willing to start trade relations with the United States but is unwilling to make any political concessions for this goal.

Yugoslavia is the country most hated by capitalist countries after the Soviet Union. Yugoslavia is the last country among the people's democratic countries to recover its gold stored in the United States and has even suffered a huge discount. Yugoslavia applied for a loan from the International Bank last December but failed to obtain it, but other people's democratic countries obtained loans for their mutual trade. Yugoslavia's foreign policy will not be changed merely because of the misunderstandings of the Communist Information Bureau. We will never betray the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia cannot be moved by the gold of the world.

### Dewey's Brain Trust

— Translated by Zhang Yunshi —

The other figures may not be well known throughout the United States, but they have hopes of forming a cabinet with Dewey. The expected situation is as follows:

Lockwood, one of Dewey's brain trusts, is 46 years old this year. He is Dewey's administrative advisor and may be appointed as the chief secretary of the White House if the Republican Party is elected. He has the power to decide who can and cannot see Dewey. Lockwood is a burly and amiable figure who used to practice law. He joined the Dewey brain trust in 1935 when he prosecuted New York gangsters.

Hedge, a former reporter for "The New York Times," is 39 years old. Unlike O'Reilly under the Roosevelt administration and Ross under the Truman administration, he has no experience as a Washington reporter. He has a good relationship with Dewey.

Burton, 40, is the current budget director of Governor Dewey. He may be appointed as the director of the US Budget Bureau when Dewey is president. Chapman, 44 this year, first took office as the New York Tax Commissioner in 1946. He is one of Dewey's financial advisors. Strauss, 59 this year, is a planning expert and may naturally be assigned a corresponding task.

The above are the internal figures of Dewey. For the remaining departments, he needs to find people from the Republican family.

The position of Secretary of Defense may be held by Senator Martin from Pennsylvania, 68 years old. The next most promising candidate is Senator Cain from Washington.

The position of Secretary of Agriculture may be held by Hopper, 55 years old this year, from Kansas, currently chairman of the Agricultural Committee. The next most promising candidate is Mayo. He is the president of Cornell University and formerly served as the administrator of the agricultural trust loan organization. Ferguson, a senator from Michigan, may be the Attorney General.

Winnemas, 47 years old this year, is a senator from Oregon. He may be appointed as the Secretary of the Interior after Dewey is elected. Milligan, 57 years old this year, is a senator from Carolina. Although he supported Taft before the Philadelphia Convention, he also has hopes of being appointed as the Secretary of the Interior or other important positions. However, his hope of remaining in the Senate is also very high.

Stetson, 41 years old this year, failed in the presidential candidate election, but his call to join the Dewey administration is also very high.

Hoffman is 57 years old this year. He used to run an automobile business and is currently the director of the European Aid Administration. He may be appointed as the Secretary of Commerce after Dewey becomes president, but he may also remain as the director of the European Aid Administration if he is willing to do so.

Milton Eisenhower, 49 years old this year, is the brother of Marshal Eisenhower and the current president of Kansas State College. He may be appointed as the Secretary of Education or the Secretary of Health.

After Dewey is elected president, the main figures in the White House may also become a completely New York-dominated administration. Now, regardless of the situation after Dewey takes office, in short, if Dewey is elected as the next president, under the circumstances of new people and new policies, he may do a good job.

### Executive Yuan Supports Shanghai's Finances, One-Time Subsidy of 1.4 Trillion, Budget Review Committee Report Believes It Should Not Rely on the Central Government

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 28th] Regarding Shanghai's financial difficulties and the proposal to request subsidies from the central government, after repeated trips by Tian Yong, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, the case was submitted for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 28th and it was resolved to grant a one-time subsidy of 1.4 trillion yuan. It has been learned that the Shanghai Municipal Government's telegram will include an additional half-month's living allowance for civil servants and teachers for June, which must be settled according to the index for that month, and the living allowance to be paid this month has reached 1.4 trillion yuan, and the index settlement will be at least 600 billion yuan or more. In addition, other temporary expenses for office, economic construction, and health, based on low estimates, require about 400 billion yuan, totaling 2.4 trillion yuan. On the income side, there is only about 1 trillion yuan, so the shortfall for this month alone will reach 1.4 trillion yuan. In addition to requesting approval for subsidies for the monthly revenue and expenditure shortfalls in the second half of this year, it is also requested that the 1.4 trillion yuan shortfall for July be allocated first by emergency order before the 20th of this month, and then supplemented later. After receiving the telegram, the Executive Yuan handed it over to the Budget Review Committee for review, and on the 28th, discussed it based on the review opinions. According to the review report, "Shanghai's industry and commerce are prosperous, and the tax base is relatively wealthy. It should increase revenue through various means and should not rely on central government subsidies. This time, the city government increased the living allowance for employees by half a month in June, and temporary expenditures increased sharply. Tax collection could not adapt, and prices continued to rise, and the difference between revenue and expenditure became even greater. What has been stated is indeed the actual situation. It is proposed to approve a one-time discretionary subsidy for some temporary expenses for economic construction and health, and submit it to the Executive Yuan meeting for decision." After discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 28th, it was decided to grant a one-time subsidy of 1.4 trillion yuan based on this report. In addition, Director Tian of the Shanghai Field Bureau returned to Shanghai by overnight train on the 28th.

### Speaker Discusses the Problem of the Garrison Brigade, Hoping Commander Xuan Will Dismiss the Idea of Resigning

Regarding the problem that the city's garrison brigade has not yet been established, this reporter visited Speaker Pan Gongzhan yesterday to solicit his opinion. He replied: The force to maintain public security in the city needs to be strengthened urgently. The local self-defense force should be quickly organized by the competent authorities in accordance with the law, and should especially refer to the method implemented by Commander-in-Chief Bai Jian Gong in Hankou of giving short-term universal military training to able-bodied young men of age, and plan to implement it. As for the establishment of the garrison brigade, the Municipal Council has already made a resolution, and hopes that it will be carried out in conjunction with the city's second phase of conscription this year, so that the patriotic youth of Taishi of age have the opportunity to serve in the military in accordance with the law, with guns never leaving people and people never leaving their hometowns, and everyone fulfilling their responsibility to defend their hometown. The fundraising of funds should first focus on the fair burden of the wealthier households. However, this matter is of great importance, and it is hoped that Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan will consult on concrete measures as soon as possible and actively carry out the plan. It is heard that Commander Xuan is currently in poor health and has firmly resigned, and the central government has retained him, so it is hoped that he will dismiss the idea of resigning as soon as possible, take responsibility for training, maintain public security, so that villains have no way to succeed, and industry and commerce can enjoy their work.

### Land Administration Bureau Planning to Levy Vacant Land Tax, to Promote Land Use, to Achieve the Goal of Relieving the Housing Shortage

[Our Dispatch] The city's population has recently increased sharply, forming an unprecedentedly serious housing shortage. However, in fact, there are still many vacant lots in the city that have not been used, and are still allowed to be abandoned. Relevant parties are paying close attention to this issue. According to news from the Land Administration Bureau, the bureau is currently planning to levy a vacant land tax in accordance with the resolution of the sixth general meeting of the Municipal Council, and has already drafted a plan. As soon as it is submitted to the municipal government for approval, it can be officially implemented. It is heard that this method is based on the provisions of Article 173 of the Land Law, designating areas and setting a time limit for building houses.

### University Student Refuses to Marry, Fiancée Denies Writing Letter of Repentance, Taken to Police Station Then to Court, Interrogated and Accused of Adultery

[Our Newspaper Report] On June 26 of this year, Peng Zhixing, a native of Huangyan, Zhejiang, and his daughter Peng Chujiao went to the police station to accuse Feng Ji, a student at Great China University, claiming that from November of last year to January 25 of this year, his daughter Peng was raped three times by her fiancé Feng Ji in the Zhongnan, Da Hu, and Da Shanghai hotels. Unexpectedly, after becoming pregnant for five months, Feng Ji refused to marry her and avoided meeting her. They requested that the police station arrest him. Feng was subsequently arrested by the police station at the Dada Wharf. According to Feng's confession: His marriage to Peng Chujiao was arranged by his uncle Wang Mengxia and Zhang Yuhua as matchmakers, and decided by his parents. The engagement took place in his hometown on the sixth day of the fourth lunar month last year. At the time, he was studying in Shanghai and did not know about it beforehand. Later, Peng came to Shanghai to study at the Southeast Medical College. Because she was unfamiliar with the place, he often accompanied her to go out shopping and watch movies. In November of last year, after watching a movie with Peng, it was too late, so they opened a room at the Zhongnan Restaurant and stayed overnight, and thus the relationship occurred. At the time, he discovered that Peng Chujiao was not a virgin, but Peng refused to reveal the truth. Later, in December of last year and January 25 of this year, they secretly met at the Da Hu and Da Shanghai hotels respectively. Through honeyed words, he finally learned that Peng had already had a relationship with Zhu Yao and Zheng Deyi before the engagement. At the time, in order to express her remorse, she personally wrote a letter of repentance and handed it to him. However, he believed that Peng had lost her virginity twice, making it difficult for her to become a lifelong partner, so he refused to marry her. At the same time, he presented the letter of repentance, the original text of which is as follows: "Peng Chujiao is 21 years old this year, a native of Huangyan, Zhejiang. At the age of 16, she studied at the Linhai Private Jiancheng Middle School and had an affair with Zhu Yaojun. At that time, due to emotional impulses, her virginity was broken by Mr. Zhu. At the age of 17, she transferred to the Huangyan County Middle School and met her sister's husband, Mr. Zheng Deyi, and was seduced and had a relationship once. These two events are the greatest shame of my life. But from now on, I will never go down this wrong path again. If similar things happen in the future, then Feng Ji can punish me in any way he wants, and I will never go back on my word. This is my word. Repenter: Peng Chujiao, April 21." Peng resolutely denied writing the letter of repentance. The police station then transferred the case to the District Procuratorate. After interrogation, Feng Ji was formally prosecuted for having sexual relations with a girl under the age of 20 (Peng Chujiao was born on the sixth day of the sixth lunar month, and was not yet 20 years old when the relationship with Feng Ji occurred). The trial will be held in the District Court soon.

### Dispute in Sanjiang Township, Xinhui, Support Association Reports the Truth

[Our Newspaper Report] Compatriots from the Zheng and Zhao clans of Sanjiang Township, Xinhui County, Guangdong, in Shanghai, claimed that their Qianhengsha Hall was attacked by Longquan Township in the same county, and four villagers were shot and killed. They organized a support association and invited the press in this city yesterday afternoon to report the facts as follows: It is claimed that the ownership of the Shangxia Sha farmland belongs to Sanjiang, which has been a fact for hundreds of years. Sanjiang has repeatedly built bunkers to prevent bandits, but they have all been destroyed by Longquan. This time, the four villagers of Sanjiang Township were killed entirely due to being attacked. Longquan Township then used water mines to blockade the waterways in and out of Sanjiang, and armed checkpoints were set up on land routes, and rice crops were seized, resulting in the complete isolation of Sanjiang's food sources and transportation. The villagers of Sanjiang, for self-defense, organized self-defense teams, but were falsely accused of being "bandit followers." At the beginning of constitutional governance, Longquan used dark forces to arbitrarily kill people, which is a disregard for the law. In order to defend justice, the association will publish the true facts in the hope of gaining sympathy and support from the press and the public.

It will be clear after the report is returned. The reporter asked whether, given the recent bandits in Sun's area, the township head had the right to kill him, and whether there was room for research between killing and intentionally killing. Magistrate Xu replied that since the case had been filed with the judiciary, it should be handled legally, and so on. The conference of all the township heads of the county was held on the same day, and Niu Yusheng also attended. After the reporter met with Township Head Niu, he inquired about the true process of the case.

### Policeman Cai Hongsheng Donates Reward Money to Children's Orphanage

Lawyer Jiang Huaisu writes to disclose and commend this action

Dear Editor: I was recently informed by Mr. Cai Hongsheng, formerly a repairman for the city's Defense Corps and currently a policeman at Lin Garden on Hongqiao Road, that at around 3:00 AM on the 23rd of this month, he suddenly heard cries for help from Minglu Garden on Dantian Road, his neighbor. He immediately went to assist with auxiliary policeman Ye Xiao, and saw that Minglu policeman Chen Wanli had been injured in the head by a thief with an iron tiger clamp. Because of his brave assistance, he captured the thief, Huang Guicai, on the spot, and turned him over to the Jihua Branch Bureau for questioning. Afterwards, he received a reward of 20 million yuan from Mr. Zheng Zhangfei, the owner of Mingdui Garden. However, Mr. Cai believes that serving the local community and maintaining security for decades is his duty, and that courageous action and mutual assistance in times of emergency are the spirit that all police officers should have. He feels that accepting Mr. Zheng's reward would be inappropriate and shameful, so he asks to donate it for charitable purposes, in the spirit of helping those in need. I have also heard that the children's orphanage run by Mr. Zhou Zuwang in Caohejing has been teaching and nurturing children well with remarkable results. Mr. Cai, due to his duties, does not have the time to do so himself and has asked me to pass this on for him. Therefore, I am sending Mr. Cai Hongsheng's reward of 20 million yuan to your newspaper to be received and transferred, and I hope that you will disclose the process to commend this action, so as to encourage and inspire others. Sincerely, Jiang Huaisu, July 26th.

### Import Control Committee to Host Press Conference Today to Announce New Policy on Self-Provided Foreign Exchange; Detailed Implementing Rules Have Been Drafted and Will Be Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval Today

To increase production and enrich materials, the government authorities have opened up self-provided foreign exchange, so that nationals' funds abroad and overseas Chinese can invest in domestic production businesses such as industry, mining, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, water conservancy, and public transportation. The Import Control Committee (輸管會) has drafted the "Measures for Applying for the Import of Investments in Domestic Production Businesses by Overseas Chinese Capital and Nationals' Funds Abroad," which has been approved by the Executive Yuan. Huo Baoshu, the chairman of the Import Control Committee, is scheduled to hold a press conference at 4:00 PM today on the fourth floor of the Bank of China Building to announce this new policy and implement it. It is said that the committee is currently drafting detailed implementing rules for the new measures. Yesterday, Chairman Huo was busy discussing various technical issues with relevant parties, so that they could be released at the press conference today.

Another report: To accelerate the implementation of these measures, the Import Control Committee has appointed Huang Qinghua, Director of the Non-Quota Examination Department; Shen Zouting, Director of the Quota Allocation Department; Chen Junren, Director of the Promotion Department; and Fang Yuanxian, Director of the Secretariat, to form a small committee responsible for designing detailed implementing rules. It is reported that the detailed rules have been drafted and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval today. It is said that the detailed implementing rules specify the types of materials that can be imported. It is reported that in addition to the production equipment in Appendix (1), the industrial raw materials in Appendix (2) and the parts in Appendix (3) can also be applied for import. However, the Import Control Committee will still closely monitor the use of imported materials. As for the handling of overseas Chinese capital imports, another small committee will be set up to be responsible. (The articles on the measures for applying for the import of investments in domestic production businesses by overseas Chinese capital and nationals' funds abroad can be found on the second page.)

### Strong Demand for Rice Drives Prices Up; Flour, Grain, Oilcakes Also Rise in Unison

The rice market rose again. The market close on the previous day had already shifted to a firm trend, so the opening yesterday morning was also strong. Rice shops had very good demand, because credit was loose and sales were active. White japonica rice and thin japonica rice in the northern market were both 37 million yuan, while some high-quality japonica rice was priced at 40 million yuan. New japonica rice from Pudong continued to be offered in the southern market, priced at 38 million yuan. Brown rice mills also had good demand, with prices rising by 2.5 million yuan each. However, the market softened slightly at the close because demand had been met. Yesterday's arrivals were 4,485 piculs.

Flour continued to rise, due to loose credit, rising rice prices, and expectations of higher prices. Retailers absorbed supplies and actual sales were also strong. Old Che flour opened at 11.8 million yuan, once reaching 12 million yuan, but closed slightly lower at 11.5 million yuan, a rise of 500,000 yuan. Bingship Flour rose by 700,000 yuan to 10.7 million yuan. Hongfeng and Jiancheng were both at 10.5 million yuan. Unhulled wheat rose by 450,000 yuan. Large bags of bran were 8.25 million yuan.

Miscellaneous grains rose in unison. With the easing of credit, demand from customers strengthened, and vendors were even more insistent on raising prices. Soybeans rose by 1 million yuan. Corn, broad beans, and northern sales were sluggish, with only a slight increase of 500,000 yuan. Barley rose by 1 million yuan. Broad beans increased by 500,000 yuan. Red sorghum rose by 1 million yuan. Sesame seeds rose by 2 million yuan. Shelled peanuts had strong demand from Guangdong merchants, rising by 4 million yuan.

Cooking Oil

Continued to rise. With the loosening of credit, all commodities rose, and expectations were strong. Vendors held firm. However, soybean oil rose only slightly yesterday because it had already risen on the previous day. Factory soybean oil opened at 74 million yuan and closed at 73 million yuan, a slight increase of 1 million yuan. The same was true for raw rapeseed oil. Raw oil rose by 5 million yuan. Jiton raw oil was 95 million yuan. Sesame oil from small mills rose the most, increasing by 8 million yuan. Soybean cakes continued to rise, increasing by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan.

### Flat Water Tea Exports Sluggish

Flat water green tea has always been sold mostly to America, but in recent years, since Japanese tea has been selling cheaply and extensively, the demand for this tea is not as urgent as before. Furthermore, the price offered is always an attempt to suppress prices. As such, it seems that Chinese tea in America has gradually lost its importance. At present, the only outlet for Chinese tea is the Mediterranean coast of Europe, but recently the price offered is also very harsh. Exporters in the city have repeatedly telegraphed to request a price increase, but they have not been able to get it. As a result, the tea market for foreign merchants has been greatly diminished. Any trades that have been made are only for waiting for shipment. As for the trend, the sellers are holding firm and not discouraged, and the future looks like it will rise. As for domestic tea, the market continues steadily with very few changes.

### Unclaimed Allied Bonds to be Surrendered to National Treasury for Verification and Cancellation

[Report from this newspaper] A message from the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank of China: the Allied bonds for the 31st, 32nd, and 33rd years of the Republic have already been fully subscribed.

If they failed to do so, they would be considered to have donated to the state and would be surrendered to the treasury for verification and cancellation. Now that the deadline has passed, any overdue exchanges will be handled in accordance with the regulations, unless there are special circumstances that have been approved by the Ministry.

Subsequently, Ouyang Duan, Director of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and Li Zhuomin, Executive Member of the Custody Committee, gave speeches, expressing their high expectations for the meeting and hoping that the supplies could reach the hands of the fishermen directly.

### Alkali Industry Prospects Optimistic; Taiwan Province Prepares to Increase Production

The prospects for the alkali industry in our country are extremely optimistic. According to surveys, the total amount of caustic soda required by various industries is more than 7,800 tons per quarter. The current production of all domestic manufacturers using the electrolytic method is more than 3,300 tons per quarter. In addition, about 1,700 tons of caustic soda are produced from soda ash and lime per quarter. The shortfall is about 2,800 tons. Now, the Taiwan Alkali Industry Company has prepared a plan to increase production. By the end of this year, the quarterly output can reach 3,600 tons. (Currently, it is only 1,500 tons per quarter.)

However, because the previous day's floating price was too high, the market price suddenly fell by 1.2 million yuan. At this time, the industry was secretly absorbing supplies very strongly. After 10:30, the market atmosphere became even more brisk, and bids to buy at 50 million yuan were made, but no transactions were made.

King George VI of England will personally attend to declare the opening of the 14th World Games. A total of 61 countries are participating in this session, with more than 6,100 athletes competing in 17 sports. The spectacle will set a new record never seen before in World Games history. The official competition will begin tomorrow and end on August 14th, lasting a total of two weeks, with Sundays as rest days. Unfortunately, three countries with outstanding athletes were unable to participate this session. The Soviet Union did not accept the invitation, while Germany and Japan were not qualified to participate. Since the Berlin World Games, more than ten years have passed, and athletes from various countries have not had the chance to show their skills in the World Games. Many new world records will likely be set this session. Among the various competitions this session, the track and field events are the most attention-grabbing, with representative athletes from 59 countries participating. Our country, in this difficult time, also has a delegation of thirty to forty athletes participating. The number of athletes in track and field, swimming, and cycling is relatively small, but the two football and basketball teams hope to have a good performance in the World Games, even if they cannot achieve any victories.

[Agence France-Presse, London, July 27th] The current heatwave sweeping through England is causing headaches for athletes and coaches from various countries. The performance of Nordic athletes in training seems to have been greatly affected by the intense heat, while South American, South African, and black athletes are happy and at ease.

[United Press, London, July 27th] Li Huitang, the coach of the Chinese World Games football team, hopes that the Chinese football team can advance to the final, but sports reporters generally believe that the World Games football championship team will undoubtedly be from a European country.

Apart from the Indian hockey team, which has a relatively clear hope of winning the championship, the chances of India and Far Eastern countries touching the various championships have become increasingly slim.

The Philippine World Games team is indeed a "strong team." The basketball team is the fifth-seeded team in the World Games. Their coach, Garver, in addition to expressing optimism about their achievements, refused to make predictions. According to experts, the "hard-working" and fast Philippine team will still suffer at the hands of the American team.

Korean athletes have been practicing diligently, but they refuse to make boastful predictions. However, their greatest hope lies with Xu Renfu, the champion of the Boston International Marathon last year.

[United Press, London, July 27th] The World Games Committee, after five days of discussion, released the list of athletes in each group of the track and field competition shortly before midnight on the 27th. With such a grouping of famous track and field athletes, unless there is a major upset, they will not fail to enter the second competition.

The 30th is the first day of the World Games competition. The program includes the 100-meter sprint, in which American athlete Ewell can easily win in the first group. English athlete McQuaid is also listed in the first group, but since two people from each group can advance to the second competition, McQuaid's advancement is not a problem. In the second group, American athlete Batten is only worried about Burling from Canada. Panamanian athlete Labiche is listed in the third group. American athlete Dillard is in the fifth group, and Australian athlete Strickland is in the seventh group. It seems that the above three can undoubtedly dominate in their respective groups. Philippine athlete Rovena is listed in the sixth group, Seychellois athlete Whitde is in the eighth group, and Burmese athlete Mangshan (transliteration) is in the twelfth group. Athletes from the Philippines and India are also listed in this group.

### The Origin of the Olympic Games and the Revival of Modern World Games

[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] The origin and cause of the Olympic Games have long been lost to history. Judging from the fact that Iphitos in 776 BC was called the "reviver" of the Olympics, the founding of the Olympics dates back more than 2,700 years.

The Olympic Games, since Iphitos restarted it, lasted for thirteen centuries. In 394 AD, the host, Roman King Theodosius, considering the declining morality of the competitors, who often resorted to various despicable means to win the championship, believed that the original spirit of promoting sports and connecting emotions had been completely lost. Therefore, he ordered a permanent ban on the holding of the Olympics. Soon, the statue of Zeus, the king of the Greek gods, was also burned, and the Olympics was suspended for more than 1,500 years.

Revival of the Modern Olympic Games

The revival of the modern Olympic Games, becoming a global event held every four years, must be attributed to Sir Coubertin, a French soldier and scholar. From the army, the knight observed that a sound physique could only come from sports training. Furthermore, from the history of Greece, he studied that the decline of ancient countries was also greatly related to the Olympics. Thus, he engaged in launching a grand World Games plan, hoping that the World Games could connect the cultures of various countries, eliminate the barriers between various ethnic groups, thereby eliminating world war and achieving lasting peace.

In 1893, the knight launched the first step of the plan, sending letters in his private capacity to sports leaders of various countries, suggesting a meeting in Paris the following year to discuss methods for the resumption of the Olympics. As a result of the meeting, it was unanimously passed to hold the first modern World Games in 1896, and it was stipulated that it would be held every four years thereafter.

The First Session Held in Athens

The first World Games were held in Athens, the capital of Greece, to commemorate the ancient Olympics. Thanks to the donation of a nobleman, a large marble stadium, which was already hailed as magnificent and majestic at the time, was built in this ancient cultural capital.

After a series of arduous preparations, the modern Olympics finally opened. Everything was just beginning, and only twelve units participated in the competition. The events were also simple and basic, but they had already aroused the attention of enlightened people around the world, opening up a broad path for the subsequent World Games.

After that, the second, third, fourth, and fifth sessions were held every four years in Paris, St. Louis, London, and Stockholm, respectively. Although the third session had only eight units participating due to the long distance and the ongoing Russo-Japanese War, with a turbulent situation, the World Games were indeed progressing towards perfection, one session better than the previous.

European War Destroys the World Games

Sir Coubertin's ideal was shattered. In 1916, the Olympics not only failed to eliminate war, but was burned down by war. The sixth session was thus aborted.

In 1920, the seventh session was held in the capital of Belgium, which suffered the most from the ravages of the god of war during the Great War. Twenty-five units participated, with 117 events, breaking the records of the previous sessions.

In 1924, Paris hosted the Games for the second time, with forty-five countries participating, and the events gradually became more complete.

The ninth World Games were held in Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands. Four thousand athletes from forty-three countries participated in the competition. The ninth session made a major and successful attempt, establishing women's track and field events for the first time.

Our Country's Historic Attempt

In 1932, in the midst of the peak of the world economic crisis, the tenth session was held in Los Angeles. Although due to economic reasons, the number of athletes sent by various countries was far smaller than in previous sessions, the quality was far superior to any previous session. Sixteen world records and twenty-five conference records were broken in this gathering of heroes. Our country also made a historic attempt, sending Liu Changchun, an athlete, for the first time. Although he failed due to natural and acquired reasons, it also renewed the eyes of foreigners and corrected many absurd imaginations of foreigners about China in terms of international perception.

After the first World War, Germany, which became increasingly powerful, hosted the eleventh session in 1936. The scientific mind and fighting spirit of the Germans made this session unprecedented. The largest sports stadium and the most well-equipped World Games Village impressed athletes from fifty-one countries and thousands of tourists from all over the world. It is regrettable that this global conference has reached its peak in terms of material resources, but the spiritual gains are pitifully scarce. The mad war drove away the god of peace again, and the twelfth and thirteenth sessions were aborted in the womb.

The first session after the war has been scheduled to open in London today. In fact, this session is only the twelfth, but from 1896, it has been the fourteenth "Olympiad" (Olmpiad in Greek, originally meaning a four-year period). (Xin)

### Snippets of New Conversations (In Nanjing)

— Bai Yong

The electricity is cut off one day out of every three. Tonight, it is again a world of darkness. Dark clouds cover the sky, and even the expected moon offers no light. The indoor temperature is a hundred degrees. Everyone is cooling off in the courtyard. Although there isn't much of a breeze to be found, at least the air is stirring a bit. Unfortunately, the rain is coming again, so we have no choice but to trim the candle by the west window. The price of each "Monk's Cap" brand candle has reached 500,000, but there's no other option.

Coincidentally, guests arrived, perfectly fitting the ancient saying of trimming candles and talking in the night rain. The two guests could be called "old friends" or "new friends." As for the former, we were all poor fellow villagers to begin with, and our conversations have something in common. As for the latter, they have already leaped from being poor to becoming "bosses," which puts them in a different category from me, this white-haired scholar who will grow old under the window. However, listening to their "wild tales" is still a source of historical material, "therefore, I record them."

Guest A: "Today, pork is 900,000, and a 'jin' (catty) is only fifteen taels. But it's not fixed. At Shuixi Gate, it sells for 800,000, at Caixia Street it's 640,000, and at Xinqiao it's 720,000. Look, what counts as the standard! The price of soybean sprouts is completely different: 120,000, 100,000, and even 150,000!"

Me: "Let's not talk about this. I heard you've been making a lot of money recently. What business are you doing exactly?"

Guest B: "Don't you know? He's been trafficking in livestock. The last time it was more than 3 billion!"

Me: "Oh? How does that work?"

B (smiling at A): "There was a major flood in Jiangbei this year, and the situation in the Suxian area is even worse. Added to that is the fighting. Livestock are all being sold at low prices. A horse costs no more than 50 million. You can easily earn over 100 million in Nanjing. The villagers are easy to deceive. They don't necessarily pay in cash. After the purchase is settled, they pay a hundred or two upfront, and the rest is paid with promissory notes. Selling on credit for ten days or half a month is nothing. With a quick turnaround, you can make money hand over fist."

A (uneasy, but also self-satisfied): "Don't listen to his nonsense. He stockpiled gasoline half a month ago, and now he's already doubled his profit. Today, he asked me to buy used oil drums. Last week, a drum was 400,000, but in the last few days, it's risen to 220,000, even those made from tin can scraps. Do you know why? Public school employees are allocated oil, and everyone has to buy containers to collect it, so there's been a big fluctuation in the market. It's true, even broken tiles have their day!"

Me: "I never thought that you, who used to be in the used book business and looked down on gold and silver, would be getting involved in this now?"

B: "Can books still be sold? A ream of newsprint costs over 5,000, and a single sheet sells for up to 200,000. Any old book costs over a million. Even if people have money, who would buy these things? Used books are even worse. Firstly, no one reads them, and secondly, the prices don't go up. Look, those used bookstores in Zhuangyuanjing are all selling by weight. The shelves are full of Feng Yuqi novels and patriotic songs. We, who talk about Song and Yuan editions, don't even bother! Several new bookstores from Beiping came to Jiangnan hoping to strike it rich, but they were all disappointed. Those who are willing to use their brains don't sell new books and instead switch back to stationery. Look, isn't a Parker fountain pen equivalent to US dollars? What we're doing is nothing!"

I was stunned, unsure how to respond.

Just then, B finished a cigarette and threw the remaining half-smoked butt on the ground: "Don't look down on this cigarette butt. It's worth a thousand or so. A house used to cost that much, and now it's lightly discarded!"

Everyone burst out laughing.

The rain stopped, and the two figures in plaid cotton disappeared into the shadows.

As I listened to the rain, I pondered this month's cost of living index, wondering how many times it should be multiplied.

Generally, when Western men encounter women on the street, they naturally remove their hats as a sign of respect. Over time, everyone has come to see this as a matter of habit, rarely thinking about the underlying meaning of respecting the opposite sex. In fact, this custom of removing hats to women evolved from an ancient law, the main purpose of which was to force "all inferiors to remove their head coverings before superiors as a sign of respect."

This law can be traced back even earlier to the custom of stripping prisoners of war of their clothing. In ancient times, the Assyrians stripped all prisoners of war of their clothes, showing their complete subjugation. Therefore, nudity was regarded as a form of worship. Even now, the custom of nudity to show respect for "superiors" still exists in some primitive tribal peoples.

As Westerners gradually became more civilized, this custom was slightly modified in form and passed down. In the age of the samurai, warriors were fully armored when they appeared in public. However, when friendly warriors met, they would remove their helmets to show recognition and respect. When these warriors encountered a lady, they would completely remove their armor. They did so to show respect or to reveal their true selves. In any case, there is no doubt that the warriors unknowingly passed on the habit of "inferiors" respecting "superiors" to later generations.

When the samurai system declined, men changed to wearing hats, and they retained the samurai custom of removing helmets for women.

Members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) were somewhat averse to this custom and refused to remove their hats to women. Because they believed that they only had one "superior," that is, God.

### Three Excellent Paintings with Inscriptions

— Zhang Yiqu

Discussing objects and satirizing the times, the artistic conception is novel,
The people's spirit is not inferior to that of the poet;
A few strokes of the brush, more mellow than wine,
Begging to be drunk in West Lake every spring. (The teacher has lived by West Lake for nearly three years.)

Inscription on Yu Shaosong's Ink Bamboo

Like Su Dongpo's elegant bamboo branches,
The clustered growth, the slender roots, the shadows, are irregular;
The dripping drunken ink is just like you,
Still remembering the time we drank together that year. (In Longyou in 1927, I drank with the teacher all night.)

Inscription on Feng Chaoran's Landscape Painting

Mountains and waters, a wild family's home,
The artistic conception of the painting and the poetic sentiment grow richer with age;
Painting to the point of a tranquil, leisure place,
A crescent moon accompanies plum blossoms.

Marshall's Lunch

According to Washington-based reporter Robert Allen, US Secretary of State Marshall can truly be said to be a "man of few meals and many tasks." There are now as many as 74 diplomatic missions stationed in Washington, breaking all previous records, but Marshall often only eats very casually at his desk in the office, eating only an apple and a bottle of milk for lunch.

### Random Thoughts on Jing'an Temple

— Chen Zuogao

Jing'an Temple was a famous place for escaping the heat and spending the summer in the late Qing Dynasty. Every summer, tourists came in droves. As the sun set, groups of people would arrive with fans and light shirts. Some brought their families, some brought their concubines. Decorated carriages turned and jade wheels rolled. Even late at night, among the sounds of pines and bamboos, there were still hairpins and earrings left behind. Today, there is an ancient well in front of the temple, located next to a streetcar station, called the Sixth Spring Under Heaven. During the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, a tea house was built on top of it. Tang Jingsong, the famous minister of the Sino-French War, once went to the temple with the Chaozhou scholar Xiao Daonong to see the ancient well. The spring water seemed to be boiling, which was the case every year. They went upstairs for tea cakes. "Women surrounded the seats, charming and lovely, but could not endure the cold and returned." See Tang's "Please Enlist" Diary, entry for October 23rd of the Guangxu 12th year.

Shen Garden was located next to the temple. Huang Xietong's "Record of Dreams in Songnan" described the place as having painted beams and pearl curtains, rising and falling with the morning and evening, showing the grandeur of the buildings and the elegance of the furnishings. When tired of walking, one could lean on the carved railing and sip bitter tea. A fresh breeze would blow away all worldly worries. Sometimes, flower branches would reach out from across the seat, beckoning to people. The sound of hairpins and the shadows of ornaments seemed to be in the curtain, and one would often recite Yuan Xiang's "Drunk, I hear the flowers rising; waking, I hear the orioles," lingering and unable to leave. Downstairs, there were several billiard tables where one could gamble under the moonlight. Western food was also available, but guests had to order in advance to avoid being caught unprepared. It is said that while drinking tea, there were also singers performing to add to the fun. A Shanghai ballad said, "With an appointment at Shen Garden to enjoy tea, hastily ascending the seat to play the pipa. After the song ends, she goes down to the singing building, and the horse-drawn carriages linger at the door." This probably refers to this.

Thirty-two years ago, when I was free on holidays, I would come with old scholars from Zhejiang to the temple to chat over tea. Forerunners such as Gao Yehou and Ding Fuzhi also attended. I occasionally sat at the end of the table, enjoying the eloquent conversations. Thinking back to the temple in those days, flowers were dense, brocade layers, forever soft dust fragrant, and various other beauties filled it. But now the temple grounds are narrower, the scenery is completely different, the surrounding buildings are crowded together, and vehicles converge, just like what Bao Mingyuan called "four-way intersections." Alas, in this noisy city, who would still see it as a scenic spot! Reflecting on the past and thinking about the present, how can one not feel a sense of vicissitudes?

### The Problem of Maids

— Qifeng

Before the war, hiring one or two maids was not a big deal, but now, in this era of high prices, the problem of maids is quite serious.

As for maids, according to what I've learned from the housewives among my relatives and friends, most of them are complaining constantly. They feel that they can't do without them, but they get angry when they hire them. This is because maids are no longer as "loyal and obedient" as they used to be. The times have instilled in them new knowledge. They have a clear and quick understanding of the decline in currency value and the soaring prices. They are no longer a group of uneducated villagers who can be bullied.

Although maids have not yet progressed to the point of organizing trade unions, their ability to transmit information is no less effective than a perfect organization. In an alley, the amount of wages at a certain house and how the wages are calculated are all found out clearly. If they have fellow villagers or girlfriends in other areas, they also meet frequently to discuss the issue of wages. If you pay them less, they will compare your wages with those of other houses and ask you to increase them. Otherwise, they will find a very good lie, and with the introduction of fellow villagers or friends, they will jump to another house. If they are not satisfied, they will jump again. So often, when your maid leaves saying she is returning to her hometown, after a considerable period of time, she will be discovered at your relatives' or friends' house, which is truly a feeling of laughter and tears.

As for wages, it seems that those who are paid a fixed wage are the most backward and honest. Although the housewife will increase the wage, it is never enough. The second type is based on rice as the standard, ranging from three to four "dou" (pecks) per month. They hope that the price of rice will rise every day. The third type is based on the cost of living index, with monthly "base salaries" of six or seven yuan. The soaring prices do not affect them, but this geometric progression may eventually cause the owners to be unable to bear the burden. The last type is calculated in US dollars. Those who know that the owner's income is converted from US dollars will naturally take the opportunity to make this request.

Maids are progressing too fast. Wise housewives, you must consider, if your maid asks you for a wage calculated in the latter three ways, how will you deal with it?

### Fruit Names

— Gongsun Wu

"Bolo" (pineapple) is not "boluomi" (jackfruit). The "Dictionary of Sources" explains it very clearly. Perhaps the owners of fruit stalls are unaware of this. Although our country is large, it is now unified, and Taiwan has also been recovered. And freight transportation is now more convenient than in the past. Family treasures and named items should not be confused because of geographical distance. It is especially inappropriate to gain the upper hand by creating differences. Fine things may have different names, but they are not convenient to say. Fruits from California or Australia are not renamed when they arrive in New York or London. If there is confusion in names, it is no different from calling a deer a horse. Take sunflower leaf fans, for example. In the Shanghai market, they are called banana leaf fans. Sunflower leaf fans mostly come from Xinhui, but Jiangsu and Guangdong are not far apart. Why must their names be changed? There are several banana trees in the Shanghai Public Concession. Banana trees are often seen in paintings. The ancients even wrote on banana leaves. How can this be the same thing as sunflower leaves that have been flattened, dried, and made into fans? Wang Yisun was from Kuaiji. His poems contain the line "sunflower fans are hard to keep." The sunflower was known as a sunflower by the Song people. Grapes are planted in Guangdong. They ripen early and are sour. The Cantonese mistakenly call them "bodhi seeds," which is quite ridiculous. It's because there is another thing in the south whose name sounds similar to the word "grape," so they made a false distinction. The character for "eggplant" has two pronunciations. It should be pronounced "jia" in "fanru" (foreign eggplant), but the people of Shanghai like to pronounce it "jia," and "fan" is gradually becoming more cautious. In the north, this thing is sometimes called "fire persimmon." A common thing has multiple names, which proves that the unification of language still has a way to go. The "wen dan" (pomelo) and "zhulei" (another kind of pomelo) are slightly different, but there is no need to force a division. The word "pomelo" is enough. Orange, tangerine, mandarin orange, and kumquat are all citrus fruits and must be distinguished.

### 

The matter of amnesty has been rumored for a long time, and there are many different opinions. Some explain it from the perspective of authority (such as the question of whether the Legislative Yuan should propose it, which the Judicial Yuan thinks is possible), some speak from the perspective of facts (such as the opinion of Court President Xia Jun that the amnesty should not be too large), some dislike the remnants of feudalism, and some even focus on the "traitor" aspect. However, examining historical precedents, it is not purely a matter of the ruler's grace, nor is it just a question of reducing or waiving the punishment of criminals. The true purpose of "pardon" and "general amnesty" is that "everyone participates in renewal," which has the highest political and benevolent significance.

Originally, the crimes of criminals are mostly caused by objective conditions. As Western civilization advances, punishments are gradually reduced, and there are also "rehabilitation" and "probation," doing everything possible to reveal the original circumstances and teach people to move upward, all in line with moral philosophy and political principles. The improvement of criminals is the common progress of the ruling class and the intellectual class. This is where civilized countries differ from barbarous ones. Chinese sages often praised "weeping for crime after dismounting the carriage" and "feeling pity rather than joy when understanding the circumstances," all of which have the meaning of forgiveness and mutual blame. The ordinary causes of crime, such as "economic oppression" (the so-called "cold and hunger lead to theft"), are the responsibility of misgovernment; if knowledge is low (greed and violence are all due to insufficient education), then the responsibility lies in mis-education. Therefore, at each autumn review ceremony, ancient emperors reduced their meals and wore plain clothes to express their regret.

As for amnesty, it is only one kind of "grace." "General amnesty" is not limited to imperial celebrations, and the "imperial grace" of imperial celebrations is not limited to "general amnesty." Therefore, "general amnesty" and "imperial grace" cannot be discussed together. The most famous amnesty in history was during the Tang Dynasty's Xinyuan Restoration, which was promulgated by Lu Xuan Gong. Even military men and brave soldiers were moved to tears, because the wording was sincere and fair, showing the unity of the ruler and the ruled. In addition to Zhu Ci, even if Zhu Tao demonstrated obedience, they were also given renewal and forgiveness. And the taxes imposed on bridge frames, bamboo and wood, and the iron monopoly were all stopped, which was a real benefit to the people. Therefore, as soon as the edict of amnesty was issued, all parties were delighted, and they turned toward the dynasty, turning danger into safety. In addition, the amnesty examples recorded in historical books, such as when celestial changes warned of danger, water and drought disasters occurred, and extraordinary disasters and chaos arose, emperors would often issue edicts to review, allowing officials to report on the abuses of both the ruler and the ruled, or report that punishments were too numerous and lawsuits were unjust, offending the harmony of heaven, and then they would consider reducing sentences, and as far as possible releasing those who were guilty of minor crimes or were of doubtful guilt. This was also the meaning of a general amnesty. Since it is said that "everyone participates in renewal," then the ruling class has a past responsibility, and not only do those who are pardoned have the opportunity to renew themselves, but those who grant the pardon must also renew themselves!

The general amnesty of imperial celebrations is not limited to the enthronement of a new emperor. For example, in the third month of Bingzi in the Song Dynasty, Emperor Taizu visited Xijing to worship heaven and earth. The old people said to each other, "Our country has rarely experienced turmoil, and today we see peace again," and some shed tears. After the sacrifice, a general amnesty was issued to express the shared celebration. At this time, it had been more than ten years since Gengshen Emperor Taizu ascended the throne. The following year, Emperor Taizong ascended the throne and changed the era name to "Taiping Xingguo" (Great Peace and Prosperity), and another general amnesty was issued, also to share the meaning of peace.

In modern times, when the former Qing emperors ascended the throne, "granting grace" was the primary meaning. "Granting" also has the meaning of being vast and universal, which is roughly the same as the "general" in "general amnesty." The first requirement of granting grace was "giving preferential treatment in the imperial examination to celebrate the list," which every emperor had to do. And the birthdays of the Empress Dowager and the Emperor were also headed by "granting preferential treatment in the imperial examination." In addition, officials were promoted and given titles, public crimes were forgiven, dismissed officials were given official titles when they followed the ranks to offer congratulations, and old people and farmers were given hat ornaments and red flowers by local officials. In places with arrears of taxes and disasters, the land tax was reduced or exempted. In short, there was always a little grace bestowed, and the general amnesty was not very noticed. Since the Republic of China, some presidents have imitated ancient emperors in issuing general amnesties upon taking office. In the 14th year, Duan Qirui, as the provisional chief executive, also issued a general amnesty decree. Following precedents, in addition to the ten unforgivable crimes, ordinary criminals were reduced or exempted, and Cao Kun was specifically mentioned as not being included in the amnesty. At that time, Mr. Shao, the editor of the Jingbao newspaper, wrote an editorial criticizing this. Cao Kun, no matter what, could not be equated with serious criminals who committed arson and flooded rivers, and Cao was trapped in the Xinhua Palace, not having been tried, nor was he accused of any crime, then whether or not to pardon was fundamentally out of the question. Therefore, the most ridiculous general amnesty of the Republic of China was that of "Chief Executive Duan."
