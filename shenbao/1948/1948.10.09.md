### The President Flew from Beiping to Shanghai, and Visited the City at Night with His Wife

[Report from our newspaper] President Chiang departed from Beiping by special plane "Zhongmei" at 2 PM yesterday, arriving at Longhua Airport in this city at 5:45 PM in the afternoon. Director Yu Jishi, Secretary Cao Shengfen, and others accompanied him. Those who went to the airport to greet him included Madam Chiang, Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, and Director Yu, among others. The giant Zhongmei plane landed safely in the dim twilight. President Chiang, wearing a black cloak and a gray felt hat, descended from the plane in good spirits despite the long flight. After shaking hands with those welcoming him as a greeting, he went with his wife by car to the official residence on Leping Road to rest. Mayor Wu, Commander Xuan, and Director Yu accompanied him to inquire about the President's well-being before departing. It is understood that the President's visit to Shanghai is purely a stopover, and he will return to Nanjing before National Day. The rumor that he came to Shanghai to deal with the issue of commodity prices is also speculative. The President is indeed very concerned about the issue of commodity prices, but price controls are now being handled by the Executive Yuan as a whole.

### The Five Provinces and Cities Economic Management Conference Opens a Group Meeting; Measures for the Supply and Demand of Important Materials in the Shanghai Area Are Determined; Prices in the Consumer Market Are Comprehensively and Rationally Adjusted

[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The group meeting of the Three Provinces and Two Cities Economic Control Conference was held on the morning of the 8th to review the conference topics and discuss measures to regulate the supply and demand of important materials in this region, chaired by Li Lixia. Attendees included Zhang Zongliang, Director of the Anhui Construction Department, Gong Peicheng, Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, Qian Zhenrong, Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, and Xie Zhengfu, Director of the Nanjing Social Affairs Bureau. Five concrete measures have been decided and will be implemented after being approved by Yu Hongjun and Chiang Ching-kuo. The focus of these measures is to invigorate the circulation of materials to regulate supply and demand. The past Shanghai method of prohibiting the outflow of materials will be revised in a timely manner. These measures have been carried back to Shanghai by Li Lixia on the express train at 6 PM in the afternoon for approval by the Economic Supervision Office.

The main points of the measures are recorded as follows: (1) The materials of the three provinces and two cities within this region should circulate among each other as much as possible, and priority should be given to supply. For example, Shanghai should give priority to supplying the consumption of manufactured goods within this region, and the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui should give priority to supplying the raw materials needed within this region; (2) In terms of prices, the prices of materials in the producing areas should be strictly controlled so that they do not exceed the price limits of August 19th, and the prices in the consumer markets should be rationally adjusted in their entirety based on costs; (3) The government, in conjunction with merchants, will jointly purchase important daily necessities for the people within this region from the producing areas, distribute and supply them, and gradually implement a rationing system for important goods; (4) In response to the panic buying trend, local governments should limit the quantity of various important materials that people can purchase each year to eliminate the abnormal panic buying mentality; (5) Domestically produced consumables and luxury goods will not be controlled and can be purchased freely.

After Commander Liu delivered an introductory speech, Chiang stood up and delivered a sincere speech, saying that he hoped that all industries would abide by government laws and regulations, safeguard the currency system reform plan, and make the people believe in the Gold Yuan notes because the government's reserves were very sufficient. He then stated: (1) The increased tax on tobacco and alcohol this time can balance the government's revenue and expenditure, which is directly beneficial to the people; (2) Increase production, and the supply department will not create high or low price differences; (3) Crack down on black markets and speculative markets. Regarding price controls, they should be fully implemented, and individual actions that create dead markets will not be allowed. It is necessary to ensure the exchange of goods and prevent shortages. In the future, merchants will be responsible for procuring goods through trade associations, and the government will provide assistance as much as possible. He also said that the government does not oppose merchants making money, but opposes profiteering. Subsequently, representatives from various industries presented the current difficulties one by one. Finally, Chiang gave detailed instructions and stated that the price limit for rice in Wuxi would not be limited in time. After the meeting adjourned at 4 PM, he summoned the heads of various counties to talk, listened to the situation in various places, and instructed on methods for the supply and demand of materials, and attention should be paid to rice, wheat, etc.: (1) Are there any large households in the countryside hoarding goods? (2) Deliberate on the local situation and seek reasonable adjustments. After the meeting, he visited Shenxin and other factories and returned to Shanghai by car at 7 PM that evening.

### The Legislative Yuan Resolves to Return the Revised General Budget for the Second Half of the Year to the Executive Yuan, Requesting That a Supplementary Budget Be Separately Prepared and Submitted to the Yuan for Review

[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] There was a surprising development at the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 8th. With swift methods, it resolutely and unanimously passed the temporary motion of more than 30 people, including Yin Shuxian, Cui Jingbo, Song Shuqiao, Liu Quanzhong, Xu Zhongyue, Deng Gongxuan, Cheng Yuanzhen, and Wu Hexuan, stating that "the revised general budget for the second half of the 37th year of the central government does not comply with the regulations, and it is proposed that it be resolved to return it to the Executive Yuan for the separate preparation of a supplementary budget." The original text of the motion stated: "After the currency reform, the Executive Yuan can use the financial and economic emergency decree to convert the national general budget for the second half of the 37th year into gold yuan and notify this Yuan of the figures. If a supplementary budget is necessary, it can also be prepared separately and submitted to the Yuan for review. The content of the revised budget submitted by the Executive Yuan is extremely complex, does not comply with the regulations of the Budget Law, and has no explicit basis in the Constitution. In order to maintain the resolution of the statutory budget of this Yuan and to prevent any misinterpretations of the normal practice of constitutional government, it is proposed to return the revised budget submitted by the Executive Yuan and request that it prepare a supplementary budget separately, which would be fortunate." After the text of the motion was read by the secretarial staff, the mover Yin Shuxian made a brief oral explanation, emphasizing the illegality of the revised general budget and urging the members to pay attention to not setting a bad precedent. Subsequently, Song Shuqiao supplemented the reasons for returning it, stating two points: From a legal point of view, the general budget is a bill formulated based on the Constitution and the Budget Law, and can only be supplemented but not revised. Therefore, the Executive Yuan's addition of a large amount of budget through revision is illegal, so the Legislative Yuan cannot follow suit and violate the law. From a factual point of view, the increased tax revenue in the revenue portion of the revised general budget has not yet completed the legislative process, and the Legislative Yuan has not yet expressed its recognition of this illegal measure, so it cannot be reviewed. The various expenditures added in the expenditure portion are also illegal. According to the implementation regulations of the general budget previously formulated by the Legislative Yuan, only the living allowance for public school teachers and staff can be adjusted and calculated according to the cost of living index, while the public expenses in the revised budget have increased eight to ten times, so there is no basis for reviewing them. Subsequently, Wu Wangji and Wang Menglin made speeches in favor, pointing out that at the beginning of constitutional government, everything should follow constitutional norms, and the Constitution should not be misinterpreted, and the law should not be defiled. At this point, the chairman of the meeting, President Sun, submitted the original motion to a vote, and the assembly applauded and unanimously agreed to pass the motion as is.

However, under the control of the communists, they dared to be angry but dared not speak.

It has four departments: culture and education, economy, politics, and land, to promote total war. Later, the members spoke one after another, expressing their support, and some members discussed that the government should not excessively use the temporary provisions of the Suppression of Rebellion Period, otherwise, if the Legislative Yuan had to use the power of Article 57, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution to change the Executive Yuan's important policies, it would not be a blessing for the people and the country. The meeting adjourned at 12 noon. The meeting continued at 3:30 PM in the afternoon, and more than ten people continued to speak on this case, mostly in favor of the case. They believed that the Legislative Yuan must first establish credibility, and the fees of state-owned enterprises must not lead to price increases, otherwise it would be ridiculed as "officials are allowed to set fires, but the people are not allowed to light lamps," and if the government destroys its own laws and regulations, it will not be able to implement various financial and economic emergency measures, then the credibility of the Gold Yuan notes will be shaken, and the financial and economic situation will be out of control. After discussing for about two hours, the result of the vote was to change the original case to an inquiry case, asking the Executive Yuan whether it had decided to adjust state-owned enterprises immediately, and stating that the Legislative Yuan opposed the price increase. Finally, the temporary motion of Hao Yaodong and more than 30 others was passed without objection, resolving to invite Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan and the responsible officials of the US Aid Utilization Committee to attend the tenth regular meeting on the 12th to report on the distribution standards and utilization of US aid. The meeting adjourned at 6 PM. The economic rationalization bill was postponed to the next regular meeting for discussion.

### To Stop State-Owned Enterprises from Raising Prices, the Legislative Yuan Changed the Discussion Result to an Inquiry Case, and Invited Premier Weng to Report on the Use of US Aid at the Regular Meeting on the 12th

[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The ninth meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 8th, presided over by President Sun. The meeting started at 9:30 AM. First, the reporting items were carried out, and then two temporary reporting items were heard: First, the Executive Yuan's News Bureau replied that the Ministry of Interior had formulated three measures to deal with the leakage of confidential information by newspapers: (1) For minor violations, a notice will be issued to pay attention; (2) For negligence, a warning will be issued; (3) For serious violations, a severe warning will be issued. Second, the Budget Committee reported the "Draft Examination Procedure for the National General Budget" which was revised according to the opinions of the Yuan meeting. After a brief discussion, it was revised and passed. Then, the temporary motion of Yin Shuxian and more than 30 others was discussed, stating that "the revised general budget for the second half of the 37th year of the central government does not comply with the regulations, and it is proposed that it be resolved to return it to the Executive Yuan for the separate preparation of a supplementary budget." After it was passed without objection, the discussion items listed on the agenda began to be carried out. The first case was the proposal by Lian Mou and others to expedite the request to the Executive Yuan to stop state-owned enterprises from unilaterally raising prices immediately. When Yun made the explanation, he presented the government's current subsidy expenditure figures, which totaled 26 million gold yuan per month for national highways, railways, posts, and telecommunications, 18 million gold yuan per month for rationing food in five major cities, 12 million gold yuan per month for public utilities in Shanghai, and 8 million gold yuan per month for enterprises under the Commission of Resources. The government was too negligent in not preparing for these huge expenditure figures in advance, but if it rashly increased the prices of state-owned enterprises for this reason, it would be tantamount to destroying its own laws and regulations, leading price increases, and destroying the credibility of the Gold Yuan notes. Therefore, he formulated three measures (see this newspaper on the 6th) and presented this case. Lian explained

### Editorial: Starting with the Price Increase Issue of State-Run Enterprises

State-run enterprises are once again considering price increases, especially for transportation and public utility services, where price increases seem inevitable. The managers of these enterprises cite rising operating costs and demand price increases to maintain operations. The government also cannot continue to bear subsidies, which would affect the balance of the national treasury. There is a growing trend to approve price adjustments. However, the Legislative Yuan believes that price increases by state-run enterprises would stir up public discontent, affect currency value, and argues that state-run enterprises should cut staff and tighten expenses, or that the government should find other ways to compensate for their losses. There are reasons for and against price increases, truly "each has their own reasons." One legislator said, "If state-run enterprises raise prices, the people cannot bear it; if they don't raise prices, the country cannot bear it." The difficulty of solving this problem can be summed up in one sentence. This past month and a half has truly exhausted the minds of politicians and experts!

In reality, the crux of the problem is not whether state-run enterprises should raise prices, but that the entire economic reform plan has glaring loopholes and the execution techniques have made mistakes that misplaced cause and effect. The plan clearly stipulates that various tax revenues should be adjusted with reference to pre-war standards, and the fees for state-run and public transportation services should also be adjusted with reference to pre-war standards. However, the prices of various goods and services nationwide should be sold at the prices prevailing in each locality on August 19, 1948, converted into gold yuan at the exchange rate. This seems to say that state-run enterprises and taxes can be adjusted to pre-war standards, while private enterprises and the people's labor must be frozen at the "August 19th" price limit. How contradictory! Yet, it was clearly stated in the economic reform plan, which concerns the fate of the country and the people. How can anyone remedy it afterward? Think about it. Since tax rates have been raised, the price of goods must also be raised. If the cost of power and transportation increases, the cost of goods will certainly increase again. If the cost of goods is high, but the price of goods is only allowed to be fixed within the price limit, how can the people engaged in production industries bear it? If they cannot bear it, they have to gradually stop work and close down. However, stopping work and closing down is not allowed by the government. Moreover, the consequence of stopping work and closing down is, of course, an increase in unemployment and a shortage of materials. In this way, repeating the cycle, even if currency reform achieves 100% success, what benefit will it bring to the national economy and the people's livelihood?

Furthermore, to control prices, comprehensive control is required. If only the prices in one place are controlled, but the prices in other places are not controlled, or only the prices of finished products are controlled, but the prices of raw materials are not controlled, how can fairness be achieved for all parties? Take fuel diesel as an example: diesel is the prime mover of industry and shipping, especially shipping, where fuel consumption accounts for the largest portion of the cost. To prevent freight rates from increasing, diesel prices must first be prevented from rising. However, diesel comes from foreign countries, and foreign businessmen will not listen to you. They say that prices must rise, or they will stop supplying, so you have to let them raise prices. Now diesel prices have risen by 100%, but freight rates have to be fixed at the "August 19th" price limit. How can the business be maintained? No wonder the Shipowners' Association called for their difficulties at the second members' meeting. In the past, the exchange settlement method was used, which was no different from the government secretly subsidizing. Now the government can no longer afford to subsidize public transportation, so what should be done? Is the burden of losses that the government cannot afford any less bearable for people running businesses? When the people can't bear it, they can only choose to close down and stop operating. Public transportation is different from other businesses. It is closely related to people's lives. If they really stop supplying for a day, everyone will be crying! In the past, during the legal tender period, the government did not want to hear crying, so it constantly adjusted various prices. When oil prices were adjusted, or foreign exchange rates were raised, freight rates also followed suit. When the cost of goods increased, prices rose accordingly, and the cost of living also increased, so freight rates had to be adjusted again. In this way, in a cycle, prices rose without end, and the legal tender expanded recklessly, competing with each other until it became unmanageable. This was the style of the legal tender period and the fatal wound of the legal tender. The reason for the injury was actually the reversal of cause and effect in the execution techniques. Now that currency reform is only allowed to succeed and not fail, the failures of the past should be used as a warning.

Before implementing the economic reform plan, don't rush into action. If various tax revenues are adjusted first, the prices of state-run, public, and transportation services are also adjusted, the prices of various goods are allowed to adjust to their natural trend, and the cost of living index is also accurately adjusted according to the latest prices, then suddenly announce a practical and feasible comprehensive economic reform plan at an appropriate time. Then the various technical problems of today will not occur. If the tax rate on cigarettes had been adjusted before the reform, how could the increase in cigarette prices have caused a wave of panic buying? If the prices of state-run, public, and transportation services had been adjusted before the reform, and the state-run petroleum company had purchased sufficient fuel diesel before the reform, why would the Legislative Yuan be in such a dilemma today? What's done is done, and regret is too late, but we should not continue to make mistakes and repeat the mistakes of the legal tender period. In other words, the administrative and legislative authorities should open the skylight and speak frankly, recognize the current reality, make thorough corrections, so that future crises can be averted in time, and economic reform can be fully successful.

To ensure the complete success of economic reform, it is necessary to ensure that the people can bear it, and the government can also bear it, but more importantly, it is necessary to ensure that all those engaged in production and operation can also bear it, so that economic activity can continue without interruption, and people's lives will not be affected. We must know that all legitimate industrial and commercial businesses are related to production. It cannot be assumed that only opening a factory is production, while running a shipping business, transportation business, public utility business, financial business, or insurance business is not production. Because the economic reform plan was drawn up in a hurry, there are inevitably many loopholes. The mobilization order also requires the Executive Yuan to stipulate supplementary measures at any time. Therefore, the administrative authorities should have the courage to quickly remedy it, and the execution should not only know to rely on the published and engraved plan, without taking measures to mend the fold after losing the sheep. We believe that the government may as well quickly calculate the cost of various goods in a comprehensive way, and make a reasonable adjustment to the prices of various goods again, and state-run, public, and transportation services are of course no exception. After this reasonable adjustment, the strict enforcement of price limits will not cause great difficulties, and the people's livelihood can be expected to gradually stabilize. If we still disregard reality and only shout "No price increase beyond August 19th" without noticing whether the production volume of "August 19th" can still be maintained, it would be like knowing one thing but not knowing the other.

Today, the central government will discuss and formulate methods to stop panic buying, and has also paid attention to how to increase production and how to dredge the source of materials, and also knows that the adjustment of co-ordination and price increases are different, then we hope that the government will make a total reasonable adjustment, rather than a price stabilization exercise with endless circulars.

### Taipei Merchants Create Panic Over Materials; Food and Vegetables Difficult to Buy; Provincial Government Decides to Ration Daily Necessities Comprehensively

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 8th Dispatch] The market situation for goods, vegetables, grains, etc. in Taipei has now followed Shanghai and entered a state of tension and panic, especially for grains and vegetables. Restaurants have no rice and flour to supply, housewives cannot buy pork and vegetables, and cannot buy rice. General goods are difficult to buy, and the actual panic buying is not serious.

According to the provincial government spokesman: The government has now started rationing food rice to 130,000 public employees, workers and their families, and sugar will be rationed to all households. Oil and salt rationing will also be organized immediately. Daily necessities such as cloth and soap are scheduled for rationing.

In the afternoon, the provincial government convened an economic conference of county magistrates and mayors to discuss balancing prices and dredging circulation, and concrete measures have been obtained.

### Central Bank Manager in Nanjing Engaged in Private Interests; Receives One Month Suspension

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch] Li Jialong, the current manager of the Nanjing Branch of the Central Bank, was recently punished by the Disciplinary Committee for Public Officials of the Control Yuan for engaging in illegal private interests. The main text is: "Li Jialong will be suspended from his position for ten months." This punishment has begun to be implemented. Li's facts of engaging in illegal private interests are due to the fact that when the Japanese army invaded in November 1937, Li sold his house in Houtou Lane to the Central Bank for 40,000 yuan in order to protect his private property and exchanged it for more than 11,000 US dollars in foreign exchange at a rate of 3.3 yuan. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945, the house was used by the Central Bank, and Li requested to buy back the house at the original price in 1946 and re-rent it for profit. The Control Yuan impeached him and transferred him to the Disciplinary Committee for Public Officials for handling. The Committee held that Li used his position as the branch manager to buy back the house, which was obviously a use of his official position to benefit himself. The negligence was difficult to absolve, so it was decided to punish him. As for buying US dollars with the house price and signing the request to buy it back and re-rent it for profit after the victory, it was not considered illegal profit-making liability.

### Non-Permanent Members of the Security Council: Norway, Egypt, and Cuba Elected; China, France, Chile, and Peru Re-elected to the Economic and Social Council; General Assembly Passes Draft Convention on the Control of Potent Synthetic Narcotics

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 8th] At the United Nations General Assembly meeting this morning, when voting for non-permanent members of the Security Council, Cuba, Norway, and Egypt were elected as non-permanent members to replace Belgium, Colombia, and Syria, whose terms expire at the end of this year. Cuba and Norway obtained the required two-thirds vote of all members in the first round of voting. However, Egypt and Turkey competed for votes as if evenly matched, and Egypt was not elected until the fourth ballot. The voting was conducted by secret ballot, with the following results: In the first round, a total of 58 countries were eligible to vote, and only 53 countries actually voted (including 5 abstentions), so there were no invalid votes. As a result, Cuba received 53 votes, Norway 44 votes, Egypt 30 votes, and Turkey 23 votes. Cuba and Norway, having obtained the required 36 votes, were both elected as non-permanent members. In the second round, the number of actual votes cast among the 58 countries was 56, including two invalid votes. The necessary majority to be elected remained 36 votes. Egypt received 34 votes, and Turkey 20 votes. In the third round, the number of actual votes cast was 56, with no invalid votes. The necessary majority was 38 votes, Egypt received 37 votes, and Turkey received 19 votes. In the fourth round, the actual number of votes was 57, with no invalid votes. The necessary majority was 38 votes, Egypt received 38 votes, and Turkey received 19 votes. Therefore, Egypt was elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the next term. As for the other three non-permanent members of the Security Council, namely Argentina, Canada, and Ukraine, they will continue to serve until the end of 1949. The allocation of seats for the non-permanent members this time is still the same as the previous plan, namely, Latin America must allocate one seat, so Cuba replaces Colombia; Northern Europe must allocate one seat, so Norway replaces Belgium; and the Middle East must allocate one seat, so Egypt replaces Syria.

Subsequently, the General Assembly elected new members of the Economic and Social Council to replace the six members whose terms expire, namely China, France, the Netherlands, Canada, Chile, and Peru. As a result, China, France, Peru, India, Belgium, and Chile were elected. The General Assembly then began to debate the draft convention on the international control of certain narcotics passed by the Third Committee (Narcotics Committee). These narcotics were not included in the 1931 International Narcotics Control Treaty. The General Assembly then adjourned until 2:00 PM.

[This Newspaper] Paris, 8th Broadcast: The General Assembly held a plenary session on the 8th and passed the following proposals: (1) Draft Convention on the International Control of Potent Synthetic Narcotics. (2) The Mexican representative's suggestion to include in the agenda that the major powers should make further efforts to resolve disputes to establish lasting peace. (3) In principle, the establishment of a United Nations postal agency and the issuance of special stamps.

### Evatt Appeals to the Four Powers to Halt the Cold War for Three Months to Allow Opportunity to Resolve the Berlin Problem; Six Neutral Countries Endeavor to Mediate

[This Newspaper] Paris, 8th Broadcast: It is reported that the President of the General Assembly, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Lie, are currently in informal contact with the four powers, appealing to the four powers for a three-month truce on Berlin, so that the foreign ministers' conference of the four powers can have sufficient time to discuss a lasting solution. Officials are unwilling to comment on this rumor, but spokesmen for Britain and the United States said that their respective governments would not accept such a temporary truce proposal.

[United Press, Paris, 8th] It is reported that delegations from countries other than the Soviet Union in the Security Council have reached a general agreement in private talks on the 8th to demand that the Soviet Union lift the blockade of Berlin. Well-informed sources said that a compromise plan is being drafted behind the scenes, proposing simultaneous actions: lift the Berlin blockade on one hand, and resume the four powers' foreign ministers' conference to discuss the German peace treaty on the other. The Security Council and the Political Committee, which have become the center of the East-West conflict, are not scheduled to meet on the 8th.

It is reported that the Western three powers have withdrawn to the background and allowed the other six neutral countries in the Security Council to take the initiative. The United Nations action to break the Berlin blockade, with Argentine representative Bramuglia as the mediator, will hold many informal talks on the 8th. The neutral countries believe that there are many ways to compromise between East and West, and these ways can prevent long-term conflicts and avoid making this General Assembly fruitless.

[United Press, Paris, 8th] Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia actively took on the responsibility of mediating the Berlin crisis on the 8th, talking with Soviet representative Vyshinsky for more than an hour to find a compromise solution. The content of their long talks has been kept secret so far, and even the nature of the compromise solution is unknown. However, it is reliably known that the solution agreed upon by the member states of the Security Council unrelated to the Berlin dispute is not much different from the US proposal. Reliable sources said that Bramuglia and Vyshinsky were very satisfied with the talks on the 8th. Bramuglia also planned to talk with Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu and the only Soviet assistant, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Manuilsky, on the 8th.

Although the British Foreign Office denied yesterday that Marshall had contacted US and French representatives in an attempt to overturn the United Nations resolution on Spain, it is still believed here that Marshall solicited the opinions of the British and French foreign ministers in Paris on whether to allow Spain to join the Western European Union.

[United Press, London, 8th] The Spanish Monarchist and Socialist parties have signed an anti-Franco cooperation treaty and submitted it to the governments of five Western European countries and the United States this week. Although officials refused to reveal the names of the Monarchist negotiators on the 8th, it is generally believed that Rubellbiru played an important role. Last year, when Rubell visited London, the Socialist leader Prieto happened to be in London. Rubell has published a denial in London, and British officials are also hesitant to claim that Rubell signed the treaty.

[United Press, Madrid, 9th] After the British Foreign Office announced that the Spanish Monarchist and Socialist parties had signed a cooperation treaty, the Spanish Foreign Office issued a statement here on the 8th denouncing it as "biased news, of course hateful, proving London's repeated attacks on Spain."    Prieto has spoken in Portugal, denying the Foreign Office's arbitrary criticism of other countries' internal affairs and inconsistencies. It also stated that the Spanish Foreign Office has instructed its ambassador to the UK to protest to the British Foreign Office.

### Eleven-Nation Group Responsible for Reviewing Atomic Energy Issues Meets; Malik Reiterates Soviet Position

### Eden Speaks at Conservative Party Conference, Supporting British Foreign Policy; Conference Resolves to Strengthen Britain's Strategic and Economic Position

[Central News Agency, Llandudno, Wales, 7th] The British Conservative Party held a national conference today to discuss the main points of imperial policy, which is to "strengthen the British Commonwealth as a strategic and economic unit." The meeting unanimously passed a resolution emphasizing this requirement, and passed an amendment advocating efforts to promote the abandonment of the Geneva Trade Agreement and not to approve the regulations formulated at the Havana Conference, as both restrict imperial preferential rights. Some representatives fear that the European Union plan may endanger Britain's imperial economic interests.

[United Press, Llandudno, Wales, 8th] Deputy leader of the opposition in the House of Commons, Eden, said in a speech to the Conservative Party conference here on the 8th: The international situation is rapidly deteriorating. He announced to the representatives discussing diplomacy his full support for Bevin's policy on the Berlin blockade, and said: "I feel extremely gloomy about the current international situation." He said that the West's response to the Soviet Union's proposal should be straightforward, that is, lift the blockade first, and then talk about the four powers' conference. He warned: "We will never tolerate further encroachment." Eden listed the Conservative Party's three major current goals - unity within the British Commonwealth, unity with Western Europe, and unity across the Atlantic. After Eden finished his speech, there was thunderous applause. He went on stage twice to thank the cheering crowd. The meeting also unanimously passed his speech as the Conservative Party's policy.

### New Rebellion Breaks Out in Burma

Air Force Sent Out to Bomb

[This Newspaper] London, 8th Broadcast: A Burmese military communiqué stated that a new rebellion has broken out on the west coast of Burma. The Burmese Air Force has been sent to attack the rebels, causing heavy casualties.

### Matsuoka Consults with Japanese Party Leaders for Opinions on Choosing New Prime Minister; We Hope That Progressive Elements in Japan Will Come Forward to Form a Cabinet

[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Speaker of the House Matsuoka took active action on the 8th in the selection of a new prime minister in order to decide as soon as possible and not delay the Diet's discussion of the Civil Service Law Amendment Bill proposed by MacArthur, which would deprive civil servants of the right to strike and collective bargaining.

After the Ashida Cabinet resigned due to the influence of the Showa Electric Company bribery case, the first thing at the special session of the Diet convened on October 11th was to elect a new prime minister. The special session was decided to be convened two weeks ago, and the purpose of the convening was to pass the Civil Service Law Amendment Bill and the Civil Servant Basic Salary Adjustment Bill. Matsuoka plans to invite the leaders of the four major political parties to discuss and request their cooperation in forming a four-party coalition cabinet. Matsuoka said: An agreement must be reached on the selection of a new prime minister and the policies of the new cabinet to avoid the phenomenon of each party competing after the Diet convenes. However, the difficulty lies in the fact that no political party in the Diet can occupy an absolute majority. It is generally predicted that the new cabinet will inevitably be extremely right-wing, because the Social Democratic Party has declared that they do not intend to participate in the new government. Shigeru Yoshida, the leader of the extremely right-wing Democratic Liberal Party, who previously served as prime minister, has the highest voice. Because the Democratic Liberal Party occupies the most seats in the Diet, but because other conservative parties have no good feelings towards him, it may hinder his election.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 8th] The Speaker of the House of Representatives, who is busy running around preparing for the nomination of the next prime minister, visited Yoshida, the president of the Democratic Liberal Party, on the morning of the 8th, and then went to the prime minister's official residence to visit Ashida, the president of the Democratic Party. In the afternoon, he continued to visit Katayama, the chairman of the Socialist Party, Miki, the chairman of the National Cooperative Party, and Satake, the secretary-general of the Social Renovation Party, to exchange opinions on the nomination of the next prime minister.

[New Asia News Agency, Nanjing, 8th] Since the news of the Ashida Cabinet's general resignation spread here, our government and those concerned about the situation in Japan have expressed deep attention. A reporter recently visited a political authority, who said: "Regarding the Ashida Cabinet's general resignation, it was expected by us, but its collapse due to the bribery case is quite embarrassing. As for the issue of the selection of a successor prime minister, we do not want to speculate or comment arbitrarily. However, in order for Japan to truly embark on the path of democracy and revival, only if this kind of person presides over domestic politics can they obtain international support."

### British Imperial Conference Scheduled to Open on the 11th

[United Press, London, 8th] The British Imperial Conference will open on the 11th, with the theme of strengthening cooperation in defense, finance, and telecommunications. At 11:00 AM on the 11th, the seven prime ministers of the British Empire will sit around the mahogany conference table in the cabinet room at 10 Downing Street.

### North Korean Troops Suddenly Redeployed, Possibly to Replace Soviet Troops

Only Three Miles from the South Korean Border

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 8th] The North Korean People's Army, which was recently transferred from Wonsan to Cheorwon (only 18 nautical miles from the 38th parallel border), is reported to have (yesterday) moved to a place only three miles from the border. South Korean Interior Minister Yoon Chi-young said when he learned of this news: The sudden redeployment of a large number of communist troops is of unknown purpose. He did not state whether the South Korean troops would rush to the border to increase defenses, but said: The strength of the South Korean government and the North Korean regime is in a ratio of one to one hundred and fifty. Wonsan is located on the east coast of Korea, and the port of Yongheung Bay was originally the garrison of one of the North Korean People's Army, totaling 30,000 men, and has a railway to Cheorwon. An American military officer here said: He expressed doubt about the redeployment of communist troops. He also did not believe in the ratio of the strength of the South Korean army and the communist troops published by Yoon Chi-young. The officer also said: There are some American troops stationed on the 38th parallel border in North Korea. The redeployment of the North Korean People's Army may be to take over the defense duties of the withdrawing Soviet troops. Observers here believe that the withdrawal of Soviet troops (Moscow originally announced that the Soviet troops stationed in Korea would begin to withdraw from the 15th of this month) will facilitate the Soviet-trained North Korean troops to advance south to the border, so that the Soviet Union can place all responsibility on the North Korean regime.

### Syngman Rhee Scheduled to Go to Japan to Discuss the Return of Korean Residents' Property with MacArthur; Allied Headquarters Preparing to Hold a Grand Welcome

[United Press, Seoul, 8th] President Syngman Rhee announced at a press conference on the 8th that he will travel to Tokyo on October 19th for a 48-hour trip to meet with MacArthur. Mrs. Rhee and one secretary will accompany him. Rhee pointed out: He will discuss many issues with the Allied Headquarters, one of which is the return of the property of the 600,000 Korean residents in Japan.

In response to reporters' questions, he said: He believes that negotiations on property rights issues are about to begin, and a solution to this issue will soon be decided. Rhee denied that he would meet with Zhang Qun, the former Premier of China. When asked by reporters about Zhang's proposal to organize an anti-communist front among Asian countries, Rhee said: This is not the "purpose" of his trip; but he said: He hopes to have the opportunity to talk with Zhang. "If Zhang comes to my office, we will treat him as a VIP." Regarding the US presence in Korea, Rhee said: "The United States has its reasons for coming to Korea. The purpose of the United States' coming to Korea is to drive the common enemy of the United States and Korea out of Korea. Now, the United States has the responsibility to help us solve the problem of the division of Korea." He hopes that the United States will stay in South Korea, at least "to give us the opportunity to train a national defense force."

[United Press, Tokyo, 8th] Sebold, Director of the Allied Headquarters Diplomatic Section, said on the 8th that the Allied Headquarters is preparing to hold a grand event at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo on October 19th to welcome Korean President Syngman Rhee. Approximately 300 Allied occupation officers are invited to participate. Senior Allied Headquarters officials declined to comment on the purpose of Rhee's visit. One party believes that Rhee is accepting MacArthur's invitation because MacArthur invited Rhee to visit Japan when he flew to Korea to attend the ceremony commemorating the establishment of the Korean government.

### Over Half of General Inspection Completed: Over Ten Businesses Misappropriating Materials; Shanghai Authorities Discover Large-Scale Underground Warehouse

[Our Report] The city's general material inspection commenced yesterday, proceeding very smoothly throughout the day. By evening, each district had, on average, completed over 60% of the inspection. It is anticipated that the entire inspection can be completed as scheduled today. Initial inspection results indicate that the Huangpu, Old Zha, New Cheng, and Songshan districts discovered the largest quantities of unreported materials and materials exceeding registered figures. Starting at 6:00 AM, 5,600 personnel dispatched by the Bureau of Social Affairs, the Municipal Police Bureau, the Youth Service Corps, the Bureau of Civil Affairs, the Military Police Corps, the Garrison Headquarters, and the police departments of the two Railway Bureaus reported to designated command locations within their assigned areas and assembled. They departed in groups after 8:00 AM. The city was divided into thirty command zones, with the heads of each precinct serving as commanders. Director General Yu Shuping of the Bureau of Social Affairs was stationed at the General Command Headquarters on the eighth floor of the Police Headquarters. In the early morning, at the start of the inspection, he personally visited the Huangpu, Songshan, and Old Zha districts, accompanying the heads of each precinct to inspect several warehouses. In the afternoon, he drove around to inspect the work progress in each district. Cheng Yi-kuan, the captain of the Economic Police Brigade, served as the head of the liaison group. Before the inspection began, he broadcast to the public via the police radio station, located at the General Command Headquarters, to answer telephone inquiries from personnel in each district and provide instructions on the work. The telephones at the General Command Headquarters rang constantly throughout the day. After arriving at the inspection locations, the workgroups, accompanied by local Baojia heads, presented their credentials to the warehouses and shops to be inspected. They reviewed the business licenses of the manufacturers and warehouses, and inspected the quantity of goods based on registration certificates. If the quantities matched, they stamped the back of the registration certificate to indicate completion. If the quantities did not match, they sealed the goods and submitted them for review. Some of the unreported materials and materials exceeding registered figures were due to continued production by the factories, resulting in increased quantities. In addition, some manufacturers stored their materials in multiple districts, resulting in a warehouse in one district having fewer materials than listed on the registration form, while a warehouse in another district had additional materials beyond what was listed. In such cases, only the warehouse ledgers could be checked at the time, and a comprehensive cross-check would be conducted after the general inspection was completed. As of yesterday morning, Jing'an District had made the fastest progress, completing 81% of the inspection. Yulin and Wusong Districts had also completed 80% of the inspection. New Cheng and Huangpu Districts had both completed over 50%, while Old Zha District, due to the larger quantities, had only completed 34%. The inspection will continue today and is expected to be completed as scheduled.

[Another Report] The results of the first day of the general material inspection revealed that, in addition to discrepancies in the reported quantities, over ten businesses had moved materials without authorization after registration. Upon receiving the report, the General Command immediately ordered the responsible units to swiftly summon the responsible parties from these ten businesses for a thorough investigation. At the same time, Director General Yu solemnly stated last night that absolutely no movement of the seven designated registered materials would be permitted during the inspection period. Anyone who resists or violates this rule will be severely punished upon discovery, in addition to detention. Furthermore, by late last night, a large-scale underground warehouse was discovered in the western suburbs of Shanghai, containing a large quantity of various materials. In the case of caustic soda alone, there were over a hundred barrels. The responsible police precinct, after consulting the General Command by telegram, sealed off the warehouse overnight and assigned personnel to guard it.

### ### No Limit on Quantity of Rice Sold at Stores; Rice Merchants' Request Not Considered

[Our Report] Due to limited rice supplies, some stores have restricted purchases to one dou or five sheng per person. Director Wu of the Bureau of Social Affairs stated yesterday that the bureau has not issued any such regulations.

As for the 50,000 tons of US aid fertilizer to be exchanged for Taiwanese grain, Yang Chuo-an, the director of the Emergency Food Purchase and Storage Committee, has returned to Shanghai after flying to Taiwan to negotiate the deal. It is reported that opinions on the exchange ratio and quantity are not yet consistent and further consultations are needed.

[Our Report] Due to the high number of people ordering custom-made suits, representatives from the tailors' guild visited Director Wu of the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday, requesting restrictions on custom-made suits, limiting each person to one suit per national ID card.

### ### Flour and Yarn Factories Lack Raw Materials; Ministry of Industry and Commerce Promises Assistance

[Our Report] Flour and yarn factories in the city lack raw materials, Director Wu Kai-xian of the Bureau of Social Affairs said yesterday.

Minister Chen indicated that the ministry would make every effort to assist with the supply of raw materials. Director Wu also discussed the issues of relief for unemployed workers and winter relief this year with Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs.

### ### Economic Management Authorities Issue Late-Night Statement: Price Increase Request for Wool Yarn Not Approved by Review Committee

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] Regarding the adjustment of wool yarn prices, a spokesperson for the Economic Supervisory Office issued a statement late last night, stating that the Bureau of Social Affairs has submitted the cost sheets prepared by the Wool Textile Industry Association to the Price Review Committee for approval. The committee has not yet approved them, and wool yarn prices must not be raised without authorization before the committee approves.

Bureau of Social Affairs Approves 50% Increase

[Our Report] According to sources at the Bureau of Social Affairs: The Wool Textile Industry Association submitted a request to the Bureau of Social Affairs to adjust wool yarn prices due to cost issues. It has now been approved to increase by 50%, effective yesterday. The new prices are as follows: High-grade yarn, 18.4 yuan per pound (Four Bees, Hero, Earth, Queen, etc. brands). Mid-grade yarn, 15.5 yuan per pound (such as Azalea, Green Beauty, etc. brands). Low-grade coarse yarn, 11.9 yuan per pound (Xiao Nan, Shuang Yang, Scholar, etc. brands). High-grade fine yarn, 25.1 yuan per pound (Three Bees, Earth, Queen, etc. brands).

Director's Remarks

Director Wu Kai-xian of the Bureau of Social Affairs issued a statement regarding the wool yarn price adjustment, stating: Wool yarn had no factory price on August 19th and was only sold in a few stores. The Bureau of Social Affairs accordingly set a retail price limit. Later, the association requested the setting of a factory price upon opening the market. Representatives of the wool textile industry also sought instructions from Supervisor Jiang, and the Supervisor's Office instructed the Bureau of Social Affairs to review it. The Bureau of Social Affairs then ordered the association to provide production costs, which were far from the retail price limit. For the sake of caution, it was sent to the Wool Department of the China Textile Company for review. The review results showed that the required production costs were similar to the figures submitted by the association. The report was submitted to the Shanghai Area Price Review Committee at its meeting last Saturday. After discussion, the new price was set according to the production costs reviewed by the China Textile Company.

Hoping for Citizens' Understanding

Director Wu believes that the purpose of price controls is defeated if factories are forced to close and cease production. Wool yarn has reached a point where it can no longer be sustained due to the high cost of raw material foreign exchange and tariffs. Anle Wool Yarn Factory stopped work a week ago because it lacked wool raw materials. In order to maintain the permanent production of factories, the government has adjusted the price limit according to production costs, hoping that citizens can understand the government's difficult position in maintaining industry and commerce.

Movie and Theater Ticket Prices Approved for Adjustment

[Another Report] The theater and film industries repeatedly requested adjustments to ticket prices because unreasonable discrepancies arose between theaters after the rigid price limits were set on August 19. It has been learned that the Shanghai Area Price Review Committee has approved a slight adjustment, which is currently being reviewed by the Bureau of Social Affairs.

### ### Implementation of Application Procedures for Transporting Materials Out of Shanghai

[Our Report] In order to prevent the escape of materials, the Supervisor's Office previously prohibited the export of materials from Shanghai. However, in order to maintain the legitimate needs of industry and commerce, it has established the "Shanghai Area Application Procedure for Transporting Materials Out of Shanghai," based on Article 3 of the "Shanghai Area Prohibition of Transporting Materials Out of Shanghai," which went into effect yesterday. The maximum quantity allowed to be transported is based on the average total amount of materials shipped from Shanghai to that location in the first half of this year. There are also strict technical regulations to prevent abuse. The application procedure consists of twelve articles. When purchasing materials from Shanghai, other locations must apply to the relevant trade association in the city to issue a transit certificate, and they must obtain certification from the local government of the place of application before the materials can be allowed to leave Shanghai. In the future, if hoarding, profiteering, or other illegal activities are discovered, the responsible trade association that made the application will be held responsible.

### ### Kerosene Approved for 50% Price Increase

### ### Aftermath of Wang Xiaohe Incident; Labor Community Petitions Authorities

After leaving the Municipal Government, the petitioning group also went to the Supervisor's Office, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Garrison Headquarters to petition.

### ### Prosecution of Sauce Shop Owner for Shortchanging Oil Allotments

[Our Report] Qiu Huanzhang, the owner of Wanyuan Ying Shop in the city, was entrusted by the Municipal Public Education Personnel Material Supply Committee to distribute cooking oil to public education personnel.

### ### Those with Duplicate Identity Cards Should Promptly and Voluntarily Return Them

Some residents of the city have residences in two different locations. According to regulations, their national identity cards should be obtained in the location of their primary residence. In the past, some residents may have been unaware of this regulation, and some have obtained duplicate national identity cards. This is inconsistent with the legal requirement of one identity card per person for household registration and has many drawbacks. In order to strictly enforce the law, the Bureau of Civil Affairs has used population cards to identify the names of people with duplicate cards, notified the Baojia in each district to investigate and revoke them, and hopes that residents who have more than one identity card will promptly and voluntarily return the duplicate identity cards to the District Office or the local Bao office.

### ### Director of the Bureau of Public Utilities Explains Key Points of Automobile Gasoline Conservation Measures

[Our Report] Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Bureau of Public Utilities, and Wang Guanqing, Counselor of the Municipal Government, held a reception for reporters at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 5 PM yesterday to discuss the implementation of the Provisional Measures for Automobile Gasoline Conservation. First, Director Zhao explained the key points of the conservation measures as follows:

(1) In order to conserve foreign exchange and reduce gasoline imports, the city's gasoline allocation has also been reduced (previously, the city's gasoline allocation was 2.2 million gallons, but now, including oil for industrial use, there are only 1.15 million gallons). The Municipal Government received an order from the central government at the end of September to conserve automobile gasoline. In fact, if we want to implement a reasonable allocation, we need to prepare fully in advance. The time to implement the order is very short, so we are handling it according to the decision of the Automobile Gasoline Conservation Committee as follows: (A) All government agencies and private legal entities that meet the central government's requirements (i.e., banks, factories, mines, and private enterprises that are large-scale and related to daily necessities) will be handled according to the "one-in-four reduction" principle. Three of every four vehicles will be allocated the prescribed amount of oil, and the remaining vehicle will be allocated the basic amount of oil (10 gallons for small cars, 20 gallons for large cars). (B) Private legal entities that meet the requirements will be handled according to the "one-in-two reduction" principle. One of every two vehicles will be allocated the prescribed amount of oil, and the other vehicle will be allocated the basic amount of oil. (C) Individuals who meet the requirements, i.e., registered physicians, will have one vehicle allocated the prescribed amount of oil, and the rest will be given the basic amount of oil. (D) All private individuals who do not meet the requirements will be allocated the basic amount of oil.

(2) To take into account actual needs, we have issued a method for issuing application forms so that those who have a justified reason for special needs have the opportunity to apply. In order to estimate this additional oil allocation as soon as possible, all those who need to apply are requested to submit the application forms to the Fourth Division of the Bureau of Public Utilities at 139 Hankou Road before the 15th of this month so that they can be reviewed by the committee as soon as possible.

(3) In order to coordinate with each other and avoid being unable to supply, we will take into account the city's oil volume and actual needs to comprehensively handle the applications of each user.

Counselor Wang supplemented that, according to the results of the review by the review panel, the city's oil volume is already running low based on the above four regulations alone. There are also 3-400 physicians with cars in the city. The Municipal Government announced that all those who meet the central government's requirements for using cars should submit supporting documents. If all of them are qualified, the remaining oil is not enough to supply all the doctors. Therefore, those car owners who have special needs and apply must be given a discretionary allocation after being reviewed and qualified by the Small Review Committee from the remainder of the Municipal Government's original allocation.

Director Zhao also told reporters: In order to alleviate the gasoline shortage, the Bureau of Public Utilities is currently in contact with Taiwan Sugar Corporation, requesting that it ship Kaohsiung alcohol to Shanghai for distribution. Because gasoline and alcohol must be mixed with the chemical butanol, the China Petroleum Corporation has been asked to produce it in large quantities.

### ### Unscrupulous Merchants Manufacturing Counterfeit Medicines; Secret Den Cracked Down on Zhongzheng West Road; Two Criminals Arrested and Sent to the District Prosecutor's Office

[Our Report] The Jing'an Temple Police Precinct received a secret report at 8 PM on the 6th, saying that there was a counterfeit Western medicine operation at 10 Chongyang Lane, Nanjia Lane, Zhongzheng West Road. Director Du ordered Section Chief Yu Ding to dispatch Inspector Meng Ruisheng, police officer Yang Jinchun, and others to the address. According to the second landlord, Quan Dade, his cousin Li Dafa had recently rented the pavilion room, paying a monthly rent of two dou of rice, and had a hand-cranked machine for manufacturing quinine pills, etc. Personnel were dispatched to wait and watch. Li returned from outside at around 11 PM, and he was arrested and a large number of raw materials were seized in the pavilion room. He was taken back to the precinct along with the items. According to his confession: He is 21 years old, from Wenzhou, and was formerly a technician at the Zhongxing Pharmaceutical Factory on Moorehead North Road. Not long after, he met a pharmacist named Guo Songquan, who lives at 49 Jiu'an Lane, Xizang South Road, and runs the Huanan Pharmaceutical Firm, buying and selling medicines for customers. Two weeks ago, Guo instructed him to quit his business at the Zhongxing Pharmaceutical Factory and jointly manufacture counterfeit medicines. Guo would supply the raw materials, and Li would find a way to get the machines. It was agreed that they would split the profits 40/60, etc. The next morning, the handling officer arrested Guo and seized a copper seal and 102 bottles of completed quinine pills. According to his confession, he had completed 700 bottles of pills, and 600 bottles had been sold to the Rencheng Firm at 114 Zhongzheng East Road, and were being transferred by employee Xie Chuanyi to Shantou Yuanxing Pharmacy, at 1.4 yuan per bottle, and were currently being boxed for shipment, etc. Personnel were dispatched to arrest Xie, and his interrogation confirmed the facts. All of the counterfeit medicines were seized. In addition to Xie being released on bail, Guo and Li, along with the counterfeit medicines, were sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for verification and handling.

### Representatives Gather Together, Shipowners' Association Congress Opens; Resolution to Send Letter to US Shipowners Association to Respond to Restrictions on Japanese Merchant Ships

[Report from this newspaper] The annual general meeting of the National Shipowners' Association was officially opened at the City Chamber of Commerce at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Those present included Huang Muzong, Director of the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, representing the Ministry of Communications, Li Shiheng, representing the Ministry of Social Affairs, and 106 representatives from 42 units of public associations in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Taiwan, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Tianjin, Chongqing, Xiamen, Changsha, and other places. After the meeting began, Chairman Du Yuesheng delivered a speech, giving a comprehensive review of the shipping industry at home and abroad over the past year. He stated that Chinese merchant ships have increased to 1.2 million tons, and Chinese ships are operating on routes such as China-Japan, China-America, and the Nanyang (Southeast Asia) routes, opening up a new chapter in the history of Chinese shipping. However, the shipping industry is a challenging undertaking, and its development and decline are closely related to the rise and fall of the nation.

Unyielding in Promoting Maritime Rights

The United Kingdom and other maritime nations are planning to complete a new ship construction program of 4.5 million tons by 1951. Furthermore, the Japanese shipping industry is beginning to recover, and our shipping industry should pay attention to this and be vigilant. As for the common problems encountered by the shipping industry, such as the difficulty in supplying fuel oil and coal, the burden of military transportation and passengers without tickets, the inability to obtain necessary foreign exchange, the disconnection of freight and passenger fare adjustments, and the lack of ship repair funds, although the government is concerned and sympathetic, it is hoped that the government can further implement positive policies to support the shipping industry. Our shipping industry should further improve its own organization, exert the power of sincere unity, facilitate transportation for the people, promote national maritime rights, work hard and persevere, so as to fulfill the contemporary mission of the Shipowners' Association. Subsequently, Li Shiheng, representing the Ministry of Social Affairs, and Huang Muzong, representing the Ministry of Communications, delivered instructions. Li stated that the shipping industry is more important than other commercial industries, and more difficult than other industries. It not only needs to complete the national waterway transportation network, but also exists in a complex international relationship. In order to cope with the current environment, it is necessary to strengthen organization, unite sincerely, in order to strengthen its own strength.

Unite Strength and Develop Outward

Huang stated that the increase in tonnage of Chinese ships in the past year has been slower than the increase in the previous two years. Due to banditry and prices, the volume of transportation has decreased, while operating expenses have increased, resulting in no ability to purchase ships and no ability to repair ships, forming a crisis in the operation of the shipping industry. In order to overcome difficulties and build a solid foundation, it is necessary to unite strength and develop outward, especially before the 4.5 million tons of new ship plans of various countries in the world are completed, and to establish Nanyang and Sino-US routes, develop overseas trade, and embrace the great era. Secretary-General Li Yunliang read the telegram from Minister He Yu of the Ministry of Communications, followed by a meeting of the Shipowners' Association Council and reports from public associations in various places. In the afternoon, proposals were discussed. Representatives from various places paid special attention to the issue of rebuilding the Japanese shipping industry. They all believed that in the last world war, Japan relied on its powerful merchant ship tonnage as a weapon of aggression. After Japan surrendered, its merchant ship tonnage should be restricted in accordance with the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration. The American Shipowners' Association sent a letter to Lu Cidelab and Zhengzhong to protest the issue of rebuilding the Japanese shipping industry. With deep consideration, it is thought-provoking, and it was unanimously resolved to send a letter to the American Shipowners' Association in response to its advocacy for restricting Japanese merchant ships.

### Female Worker Suffers from Bad Reputation, Seeks Death by Drowning Herself in River, Fortunately Rescued

Shen Suzhen, a 25-year-old woman from Nanjing, married Hu Kewen, a fellow villager. Later, Hu lost his job, and Shen was introduced to work as a female worker at the Shanghai Greater China Rubber Factory. Due to her hard work, she was repeatedly given raises, which caused jealousy among the female workers around her. They spread rumors that she had an affair with Wu Yongda, the foreman, which led to Wu's wife questioning and beating Shen and asking the guarantor to cancel the guarantee. Shen was subsequently fired by the factory. At this point, Shen was completely devastated. On the 6th, she took a bus to Dangzhou, got off the bus, walked alone to Chunting Bridge outside the North Gate, and jumped into the river to commit suicide.

### Kowloon Miracle: Large Flight of Water Beetles

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Hong Kong, 5th] I remember two weeks ago, swarms of small yellow birds were discovered flying south from Canada over New York. In the dark of night, they flocked to the 1,000-foot-high Empire State Building, and many lost consciousness from crashing into the building. The small yellow birds fell like rain onto the streets, lasting for several hours, which was called a miracle. Recently, over the past two or three nights, a "slightly different" miracle has appeared on the Kowloon Peninsula across from Hong Kong. Between 1:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m., tens of thousands of "dragon winds" flew in formation over Nathan Road, Tai Po Road, Waterloo Road, Argyle Street, and other places. "Night travelers" and police officers all witnessed this strange phenomenon.

"Dragon wind" is a small insect that can swim in water and fly in the air. It is found in the plains of the countryside, resembles a common stink bug, is the size of a teaspoon, and is a nourishing snack for the people of Guangdong after autumn, along with osmanthus cockroaches. Therefore, over these two or three nights, many shopkeepers or apprentices in Kowloon took cloth bags or thread nets to catch "dragon winds" and fry them to eat.

From a scientific point of view, there must be a reason for "dragon winds" to leave the plains and fly, but the citizens of Kowloon insist that it is a harbinger of a major disaster. They pointed out that in August 1941, Kowloon also discovered a large flight of "dragon winds." Afterwards, a major epidemic broke out in the villages of Kowloon City, killing more than a thousand people. In less than four months, the Japanese army invaded Kowloon, and Hong Kong suffered its greatest hardship in a century. After seven or eight years, the residents of Kowloon saw the black "dragon winds" returning in formation for the second time. They were panicked and believed that some major disaster was about to strike, and they were making ignorant speculations.

### International Background of the Greek Border Conflict (Middle) (Continued from This Newspaper on the 7th)

— Xin Feng, Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in Europe

The current situation on the northern border of Greece must be observed in conjunction with the historical relationship between Greece and the three countries of Albania and Southern Europe. During the Balkan Wars in 1912 and after the First World War and between 1918 and 1939, Greece and Southern Europe maintained friendly relations. However, during the same period, relations between Greece and Albania were repeatedly disrupted due to a number of issues.

There were many reasons for the disputes between Greece and Albania between 1913 and 1948. After Albania became independent in 1913, the Albanian border was not resolved until July 30, 1926. At the same time, Greece, based on cultural and situational reasons, demanded the annexation of northern Epirus. Albania disagreed and instead demanded the annexation of southern Epirus, which belonged to Greece. This matter was particularly demanded between 1939 and 1941 due to the encouragement of the Italian fascist regime in Albania. Since November 1940, Albania has also invaded and occupied Greek territory after Italy declared war on Greece. Therefore, Greece still considers itself to be in a state of war with Albania, and normal diplomatic relations between the two countries have never been restored. Even when the Treaty of Peace was signed with Italy on February 10, 1947, the issue of northern Epirus remained unresolved.

During the Balkan War (1912-1913), the relationship between Greece and Yugoslavia was quite friendly, and they fought side by side during the First World War. On February 9, 1934, the two countries also jointly signed the Balkan Pact with Romania and Turkey. There is a rather intriguing point in the protocol of the treaty, which stipulates the following circumstances as acts of aggression:

"Supporting armed bandits within its territory and the invasion of another country's territory by bandits within its territory, or refusing the request of the invaded country to take effective measures to eliminate any assistance and protection of bandits within its territory."

The borders of the two countries were set by the Bucharest Convention on August 10, 1913. There were no serious border disputes between 1917 and 1944, but since then the Greek government has often felt uneasy due to various pretexts of Yugoslavia on the southern border of Greece. The main issue between Greece and Southern Europe is that Southern Europe wants to obtain its economic outlet in Thessaloniki on the Aegean Sea. This issue was originally resolved in the Greek-Southern European Treaty of May 10, 1923, which established a "free zone" for Southern Europe in Thessaloniki, and was further stipulated in the treaty of March 17, 1929, which provided greater freedom and convenience for the zone, as well as convenience in railway transportation.

Relations between Greece and Southern Europe were often disrupted between 1912 and 1948. After Bulgaria occupied southern Thrace, it continued to covet Macedonia. During the Greek civil war, Greece repeatedly provided Bulgaria with economic convenience in the Aegean Sea, and finally established a "free zone" for Greece in Thessaloniki in October 1925. However, Bulgaria did not make use of this convenience, because Bulgaria has always believed that in order to achieve its economic outlet, it must obtain that territory. In April 1941, Bulgaria participated in World War II and invaded western Thrace in an attempt to seize western Thrace, which belonged to Greece. After the end of World War II, Greece demanded to revise the border with Bulgaria in order to maintain the security of Greece along the Bulgarian border. Bulgaria not only disagreed, but also demanded the cession of all of western Thrace, which belonged to Greece. Although Greece signed a peace treaty with Bulgaria on February 10, 1947, normal diplomatic relations between the two countries have not yet been restored.

Greece and its Balkan Allies

Relations between Greece and its northern neighbors deteriorated between 1947 and 1948. The alliance system concluded in Eastern and Southern Europe during this period had a direct impact on this issue. When Albania and Southern Europe signed a treaty of alliance on July 9, 1946, they issued a declaration stating: "The signing of this treaty comes at a time when a certain party is attempting to launch another war, and at a time when its tendency to aggression is most evident." It also stated: "At a time when the aggression of the Greek Empire and its instigators against Albania and Southern Europe will endanger peace in the Balkans and the world."

Southern Europe and Bulgaria signed the same treaty of alliance on November 27, 1947, and its intention was clearly stated in the joint declaration of the two parties. When signing the treaty, the joint declaration of the two countries stated that they did not recognize the United Nations Balkan Committee, saying: "The representatives of the two countries unanimously believe that the establishment of the United Nations Balkan Committee is a violation of the spirit of the United Nations and the principle of unanimous agreement of the five powers, and endangers the sovereignty of the Balkan countries. Therefore, the two countries cannot cooperate with the committee and will not allow the committee to enter their territory."

Albania and Bulgaria also signed the same treaty of alliance on December 6, 1947, and their joint declaration stated:

"Regarding the restoration of diplomatic relations with Greece, the two governments believe that today's Greece is no longer an independent and sovereign country, and therefore cannot restore diplomatic relations... Their representatives expressed their sympathy to the Greek people for their struggle for national freedom on behalf of the Albanian and Bulgarian people." It also stated:

"The representatives of the two countries believe that the establishment of the United Nations Balkan Committee is a violation of the spirit of the United Nations and endangers the sovereignty of the Balkan countries. Therefore, the three countries cannot allow it to enter their territory."

At the same time, Albanian Prime Minister General Enver Hoxha announced to the press:

"Our people express their utmost sympathy to the heroic struggle of the Greek people. We will give them the strongest spiritual and political support, not only because they deserve it in all respects, but also because the free liberation of the Greek people will lay the foundation for peace and democracy in Europe and the Balkans, and the world will benefit from it."

Bulgarian Prime Minister Dmitrov said at the same time:

"We firmly believe that General Hoxha will agree to jointly support the Greek compatriots and their democratic army, whose victory is necessary for peace in the Balkans and international peace."

Bulgarian Prime Minister Dmitrov also said in his New Year's broadcast on December 31, 1947:

"The Greek fascist empire provokes disputes on our border and sends people to our country to engage in terrorism and espionage. The Bulgarian people deeply love lasting peace, so they are determined to work actively to defend their independence and are willing to be a solid and powerful member of Balkan democracy and peace. The heroic struggle of the Greeks for freedom and independence must be supported, because their southern neighbors are struggling for justice, which is a very valuable contribution to establishing friendly relations between the Balkan countries."

Although the Greek-Bulgarian peace treaty was signed on November 19, 1947, Greece's attempts to restore diplomatic relations with Bulgaria have been repeatedly met with various demands from the Bulgarian government, such as the withdrawal of Greek military liaison officers and the arrest of a large number of Greek people.

Regarding the relationship between Greece and its northern neighbors, the Greek representative reported to the Balkan Committee on December 2, 1947, saying in essence:

"The Greek government has always followed the spirit of the Charter and the resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly to seek a peaceful solution to its disputes with its northern neighbors. The Greek government also hopes to establish normal diplomatic relations with its three northern neighbors with the same enthusiasm and goodwill. The Greek government regrets that the relationship between Greece and its two southern countries in the past two years has not been as frank as in the past, but the Greek government firmly believes that Greece and its southern countries were not only once allies, but also fought side by side, and they will be able to respect each other to rebuild the way of cooperation. Regarding Bulgaria, Greece suffered three hardships in 30 years, and its occupation of Greek territory during World War II caused great losses and destruction to Greece. The Greek government has signed a peace treaty with it and is ready to rebuild diplomatic relations with it. As for Albania, our country is also very willing to rebuild normal diplomatic relations as soon as possible. Since 1940, Greece and Albania have always been in a state of war. We sincerely hope that the outstanding issues between the two countries can be resolved as soon as possible, and friendly diplomatic relations can be rebuilt" and so on. (To be continued)

### Increased Arrivals Seen Slightly Improving Rice Sales; China Trust Bureau Negotiating Foreign Rice Purchases from Thailand and Burma

Rice arrivals have increased under the Market Management Committee's urging of businesses to register their stock. Yesterday's registered arrivals saw an increase, with the North Market receiving 723 "shi" (石, a unit of dry measure), mostly of white "geng" (粳, japonica rice) and "yangxian" (羊秈, a type of indica rice). The South Market received 199 "shi," consisting only of white "geng" and "yangxian," for a total of 922 "shi" of arrivals. Sales in the North Market have also shown some activity, although purchases are generally difficult to secure. Prices in the North Market are uniformly set at the maximum price limit.

Flour: Still no transactions. Retail outlets only receive twenty bags of allocated flour per day, which is not only insufficient to meet demand but also provides meager profits, inadequate to cover operating expenses.

Grains: Several types of miscellaneous grains saw limited sales. 165 bags of Poyang small soybeans were offered, but demand far exceeded supply, leaving most potential buyers empty-handed. A small amount of Anqing yellow soybeans was traded at $10.66 per unit. Secondary quality "guandian" red sorghum was priced at $10. In addition, a large quantity of sesame was offered, and nearly one hundred bags of shelled peanuts were also offered at the price limit.

Cooking Oil: Although the market has been ordered to close, many business representatives still gather, but no transactions take place. The Oil Association is currently occupied with registering the inventory of its members.

Furthermore: The China Trust Bureau, on behalf of the Grain Department, has purchased 55,000 tons of rice abroad, with 24,000 tons already arriving. This batch of rice was purchased from Siam. Due to recent unrest in Siam, further procurement is impossible. The Bureau has decided to switch to Annam and Burma to continue negotiating the purchase of 31,000 tons.

### Strict Review of Applications for Southward Transportation of Cooking Oil

Previously, in response to requests from various regions and to strengthen the domestic flow of goods, the authorities partially lifted the ban on southward transportation of cooking oil. To ensure consistent procedures, the Export-Import Control Commission has stipulated the following measures for applying to transport cooking oil southward. The main points are as follows: (1) Cooking oil merchants in this city applying to transport cooking oil out of the city must present supporting documents and apply to the Export-Import Control Commission for approval before notifying Customs for clearance. Those not in this city may apply to the Export-Import Control Commission's branch offices. (2) The southward transportation of cooking oil is temporarily limited to Guangzhou, Shantou, and Xiamen. Cooking oil merchants in this city transporting cooking oil to the destination port must have certification from the cooking oil trade association at the destination port, listing the required transportation costs, oil quality, and quantity, and approved by the local governing authority. (3) The Export-Import Control Commission may set quotas based on the monthly cooking oil needs of various regions and allocate transportation within these limits. Applications exceeding the quota will be handled jointly by the Export-Import Control Commission and the Economic Supervisory Office. (4) After permission for the export of cooking oil is granted, the Export-Import Control Commission may notify the local governing authorities and submit the monthly amount of cooking oil transported out to the Executive Yuan for review.

### Vigorous Sugar Sales

Yesterday, the sugar market was firm and active. With people taking a wait-and-see approach, trading within the market became sluggish. Sales on this street, however, were particularly robust, with businesses displaying strong demand. However, under price-controlled trading, holders were unwilling to easily part with their goods, and the market atmosphere was keen. The types of sugar offered on the market were extremely limited, with only limited quantities of "Xinghua" white, "Xinghua" red, and local sugar being sold off, and otherwise prices existed without goods.

### Nine Private Banks and Financial Houses Increase Capital

Banking circles report: Local private banks and financial houses are actively increasing their capital. Nine have already made decisions:

(1) Jiading Commercial Bank: $500,000 (by October 30th). (2) Xintai Commercial Bank: $500,000 (by October 20th). (3) Zhejiang Commercial Savings Bank: $300,000 (by October 25th). (4) Pudong Bank: $500,000 (by October 15th). (5) Shende Financial House: $350,000 (by October 19th). (6) Yuanshun Financial House: $250,000 (by October 15th). (7) Hengli Bank: $500,000 (by October 16th). (8) China Trade Bank: $500,000 (by October 20th). (9) Zhejiang Chufeng Bank: $250,000 (by October 16th).

[Also reported] Since the government announced measures for increasing capital in the banking and financial industries, banks and financial houses in various regions have been actively preparing for capital increases. In this city, more than fifty banks and financial houses have successively published notices to shareholders, convening extraordinary shareholders' meetings. Banks account for two-thirds of these, with the remainder being financial houses. So far, trust companies have not been heard to have any intention of increasing capital. According to reliable sources, most trust companies in this city, except for one or two, will merge with commercial banks and financial houses to establish banking and financial house trust departments to reduce the burden of increasing capital.

### Taxation Standards for Imported Goods

Trade Promotion Association Requests Correction

Since the promulgation of the Emergency Measures for Financial and Economic Affairs, commodity prices across the country have complied with government regulations and been frozen according to the transaction prices of August 19th. However, the Customs continues to levy customs duties on various imported goods, either based on the foreign price plus 5% or estimated based on the market price, resulting in increased costs for imported goods. As a result, most manufacturers are wary of ordering raw materials from abroad, which not only causes significant damage to the business of importers, but also affects the supply and demand of raw materials. In view of this, the International Trade Promotion Association of this city recently submitted a special request to the Economic Control Supervisor's Office, requesting correction.

### Soaring Rubber Raw Materials; Finished Products Out of Stock

Retailers Flock to Association Hoping to Receive Allocated Goods

Rubber manufacturers have recently suffered significant losses due to the effects of "panic buying." Large rubber factories such as Da Zhonghua and Zhengtai have delayed allocation dates as a passive resistance measure because the black market price of raw rubber has doubled the price ceiling and other raw materials have soared, resulting in a sharp increase in production costs. Small manufacturers, on the other hand, cite the production of military shoes as an excuse for not supplying goods in order to avoid losses, causing rubber merchants to fear that it will be difficult to replenish their stock after it is sold out, and their reserves are becoming increasingly depleted. All long boots, special sports shoes, and large flat boots have disappeared from the market. Only flat overshoes and low-end rubber shoes are available, and merchants from various regions continue to come to search for them. As for the Rubber Association, it has been closed for a long time. Recently, Yuanyuan Zipper Shoes were allocated to its members, divided into three grades: A, B, and C. Grade A members received one dozen, Grade B received nine pairs, and Grade C received six pairs, with an allocation price of $26.39 per dozen, totaling more than 200 dozen allocated. Many non-member retailers, unwilling to give up their right to receive allocations, have flocked to apply for membership, resulting in more than 100 units registering for membership in a single day, and a continuous stream of applicants.

### Private Cotton Mills Meeting Yesterday

Discussing the Collection of Joint Purchase Funds

The Cotton Spinning Association of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai regions convened a general meeting of representatives of all its private members regarding the iron collection of funds for the National Cotton Joint Purchase. More than 70 member representatives were present, chaired by Wang Qiyu. Matters discussed: (1) The proposal to pay two-thirds of the funds for the National Cotton Joint Procurement Office first. Resolved: Due to the financial difficulties of the member factories, the attending representatives are requested to consult with the Joint Procurement Committee to pay one-half first, and the remaining one-half will be paid subsequently when the cotton collection funds need to be increased. (2) The proposal to allow members with less than 3,000 spindles to purchase on their own at the price limit. Resolved: As this matter concerns overall joint procurement, all factories should uniformly abandon self-purchase. This association has no right to decide on this matter. All the difficulties mentioned by members with less than 3,000 spindles and the proposed remedial measures can be forwarded by the association to the National Cotton Joint Procurement Committee for review.

### Cotton Market Forbids Members from Entering

After receiving orders to suspend trading, the Cotton Yarn Market Association authorities, in order to strictly comply with the law, have prohibited members from entering the market starting yesterday to prevent violations.

Textile Construction Sells Yarn

Yesterday, the yarn market continued to be suspended. Textile Construction Company sold replicated yarn for industrial use as usual, totaling six types (goods and prices listed in the market price list). However, fine yarn 32s Yanghe, 42s double-ply Lima, and Caiqiu mercerized thread are limited to one type per household. Duplicate purchases will be voided.

Joint Yarn Allocation

[Reported by this newspaper] The Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Eastern Anhui Cotton Spinning Association's civil yarn allocation has reached its fifth phase. All of the first and second allocations totaled 2,050 pieces. From October 5th to 8th, the total amount of yarn and cloth sold independently by various private factories, as reported and converted to 20s cotton yarn, was 1,258 pieces of yarn and 25,941 bolts of cotton cloth. It is reported that the factories' slips for American aid cotton have also been completed and can be grouped to extract cotton tomorrow for factory use.

### China Textile Holds Board Meeting

His resignation is said to be firm.

### Spot Cotton Still Scarce

Transactions in spot cotton have not been heard to have resumed. The market is invisibly deserted. Zhoupu seed cotton is being transacted at the limit price in small volumes.

### Two Major Problems in National Cotton Procurement: Panic Buying of Cotton in War Zones and Urgent Transportation of Shaanxi Cotton

Since the authorities decided that this year's national cotton procurement work will be jointly undertaken by state banks and businesses to form a joint procurement office, all parties have been intensifying their efforts in this area. A reporter from the Joint Credit Investigation Bureau visited a cotton industry magnate yesterday morning to understand this year's national cotton production and procurement volume. According to his estimates, this year's national cotton production is approximately 8 to 9 million "sima dan" (司馬擔, a unit of weight), but most production areas are engulfed in war, so the actual amount received will likely be greatly reduced. Although cotton-producing areas such as Shaanxi are relatively stable, they cannot be transported out due to transportation limitations. Therefore, he believes that in addition to cooperating with businesses to form a joint procurement office, the authorities should also promptly find ways to address the issues of how to rush-purchase cotton in war zones and how to facilitate the transportation of raw cotton, so that the procurement work can be expected to be effective.

He also pointed out that the amount of cotton stored in Shaanxi is extremely abundant, approximately 300,000 "dan," but it cannot be transported out due to transportation difficulties. Textile factories in various regions are in a state of frequent or semi-shutdown due to the lack of raw materials, except for Shanghai, which is barely maintaining operation.

[Reported by this newspaper] In order to facilitate the work, it is heard that after the National Cotton Joint Procurement Committee decided to jointly procure national cotton on a comprehensive basis, the persons in charge of the branch offices and stations established throughout the country will be temporarily transferred from the Textile Construction Company's branch offices as concurrent positions. The persons in charge of the various offices have already come to Shanghai by different routes and will hold a meeting to jointly discuss ways to promote joint procurement after Liu Gongyun, Chairman of the Joint Procurement Committee, returns to Shanghai.

Also reported: Wang Xingyao, the person in charge of the China National Products United Operation Company, visited Liu Gongyun, Deputy Governor of the National Bank, yesterday morning. According to him, the export of yarn and cloth has gradually improved due to the increase in exchange rates, but it is still difficult to expand due to export restrictions. He is now planning to request the National Bank to transfer the export trade of yarn and cloth to the Dutch East Indies to his company. The import of yarn and cloth in the Dutch East Indies is also the responsibility of local importers. If the trade could be handled by his company, export trade could be expanded.

The cotton cloth market also continues to be closed. Of the thirteen types of cloth previously sold by Textile Construction, 1,176 purchase orders were approved, totaling 39,710 bolts of cloth and 4,500 pounds of remnant cloth. Among these, 66 orders were from factories, receiving 5,670 bolts, 1,110 orders were from cloth stores, receiving 34,040 bolts, and 4,500 pounds of remnant cloth, valued at 883,951 Gold Yuan. The cloth supplied is mostly for retail stores in order of assigned number, with fewer wholesale stores.

Also reported: The cotton cloth association has sold out the cloth originally supplied to private dyeing factories and needs a slight delay of some days. About 60,000 more bolts may be supplied successively.

### Export-Import Control Commission Continues to Allocate Silk to Promote Exports of Silk Fabrics

[Reported by this newspaper] According to the Export-Import Control Commission, the high cost of domestic raw silk, coupled with the competition from rayon and Japanese silk, has made exports difficult. In view of this, the Commission previously decided to allocate raw silk to silk factories to help them process silk fabrics for export, estimating that exporters of these finished products can profit. Recently, there has been enthusiastic participation from the various manufacturers applying to the Commission for allocation. Major silk weaving factories in this city, such as Meiya, Xinchang, Dafeng, Renfeng, and Shanghai Silk Weaving Production and Sales United Company, are all included. The first allocation was for Grade C and D raw silk, totaling 200 "dan," and is about to be fully allocated, with a total of US$140,000 expected. In order to continue reducing the production costs of manufacturers, promote increased production of silk fabrics, and earn foreign exchange, the Commission recently negotiated with the National Bank and obtained approval to allocate an additional 200 "zu" at the original allocation price (US$3.50 per pound for Grade D silk) for continued implementation. It is expected that the export of domestic silk fabrics will be more vigorously developed in the future.

### Promoting Mutual Understanding Among Asian Peoples; China Asia Relations Association Established in Nanjing, Elects Directors

[Reported by this newspaper from Nanjing on the 8th] The China Asia Relations Association held its inaugural meeting at the Overseas Chinese Guesthouse at 5:00 PM on the 8th. Over one hundred members of the four organizing groups, academic societies, and associations involved, as well as preparatory personnel Zhu Jia-hua and Zhang Dao-fan, attended.

Chairman's Address: Chairman Wu Tiecheng delivered an address, stating that Asia accounts for half of the world's population and occupies an important position internationally. It was decided at the Pan-Asia Conference in New Delhi last April to establish the Association, with the aim of promoting understanding and cooperation among the people of various Asian regions and contributing to peace and prosperity. Next year, China will be responsible for convening a conference.

Hu Shi's Speech: Hu Shi then delivered a speech, stating that 28 countries attended the conference in New Delhi last year, including Vice Minister Hang Li-wu representing China. China must be the host for next year's conference, so it is actively forming this association. As a university professor for 31 years and a university president for two years, he offered two suggestions from an educational standpoint for the China Asia Relations Association to consider: (1) China is a major world power, one of the Five Great Powers, and the largest country in Asia, but the nation's universities have not established departments or research on the languages, histories, and scripts of Asian countries such as Siam, Burma, India, Annam, and Korea in order to communicate and promote understanding. In the case of India, according to surveys, there are 400 million people, and the lack of communication in language and culture is regrettable. Since Peking University established a Department of Oriental Languages to study Sanskrit, the Islamic community has provided funds to send students to the university. It is hoped that the government will attach importance to this matter, because promoting cooperation and understanding among Asian countries requires cultivating talent in Oriental languages, scripts, and histories. (2) After World War II, imperialism was defeated, and nations were liberated to survive and establish themselves. Our overseas Chinese, earning a living with their hard work and sweat, often face misunderstandings and endure suffering. To remedy this, the most thorough solution is to increase understanding among the nations of Asia, which can be improved. Therefore, I believe that this association is not just an international diplomatic facade, but is related to all Asian countries, so that it can increase understanding and be the foundation for peace and prosperity. Subsequently, Cao Peizi, Director of the Department of Social Affairs, and Hang Liwu, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education, reported on the preparations and passed the constitution.

Election of Directors: Hu Shi, Zhang Qun, Xu Chonghao, Jiang Menglin, Wu Tiecheng, Zhu Jiahua, Wang Shijie, Chen Guangyu, Wu Yifang, Peng Xuepei, Zhou Gengsheng, Zheng Yanfen, Zhang Daofan, Hang Liwu, Ye Gongchao, Luo Jialun, Yu Bin, Chen Daqi, He Yaozu, Chen Bosheng, Liu Yutang, Chen Bingzhang, Shao Yulin, Chen Qingyun, and Sun Guiji, were elected as 25 members of the Board of Directors. Dai Chuanxian and Yu Youren, among others, were elected as honorary directors.

Definition of Tasks: The articles of association of the Association define the following tasks: (1) Liaising with the General Association of Asian Relations and friendly associations in various Asian regions. (2) Handling matters entrusted by the General Association and friendly associations in various regions. (3) Conducting research to promote Asian relations. (4) Communicating with relevant groups in Asia and exchanging research materials and publications. (5) Hosting visits to China by individuals related to the General Association and friendly associations in various regions. (6) Other matters promoting the association's work. It is also understood that the association's funding will come from membership fees and donations. The association's headquarters will be located in the capital.

### Victory Cup Volleyball Championship; St. John's Wins Championship; Weng Chengguang, Despite Illness, Appears on Court and Recovers a Dangerous Situation

[Reported by this newspaper] The St. John's University volleyball team relied on Weng Chengguang's courageous appearance on the court, despite his illness, to boost morale and defeat Yongyi three to one, winning the Victory Cup championship. The awards were presented by Watson & Co. on the spot after the match, and the Victory Cup came to a successful conclusion.

Both teams fought with all their might in yesterday's match. St. John's had superior skills and coordination and could have easily won. However, because spiker Weng Chengguang suddenly suffered from diarrhea, he struggled to support the team. Peng Zhongquan had not fully recovered from typhoid fever, which affected his combat effectiveness considerably. Fortunately, after Yongyi tied the score at one game each, Weng Chengguang reappeared on the court despite his illness, recovering the third game from a state of decline and laying the foundation for victory.

The match began at 6:30 PM. John opened the scoring first but was overtaken by Yongyi. The score fluctuated between one or two points, and the tension was extreme. When John took a 20-19 lead, Yongyi tied the score at 20 each, but John still scored two consecutive points, winning the first game.

In the second game, Weng Chengguang gradually felt unable to support himself, and Wu Xinyun rushed to replace him. Yongyi counterattacked and took the lead. John followed closely. Yongyi fought hard and finally tied the score at 21-19.

In the third game, Yongyi continued to take advantage of their momentum and once led 10-5. However, because Weng Chengguang returned, the soldiers of John used their lives. Qian Jiaxiang's clever lobs, Sun Zunqiang's quick press, supplemented by Liu Yongqiang's and Weng Chengguang's spikes, chased six consecutive points. The back defenders Wu Xinyun, Ye Qingqiang, and Dong Weitao desperately saved, and finally came from behind to lead for the second time at 22-20.

In the final game, John became more and more courageous and always led from afar. Yongyi struggled in vain and lost the battle at 15-21, finishing as the runner-up. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

St. John's

Hu Siqing Liu Yongqiang Yang Renzhi

Qian Jiaxiang Peng Zhongquan Ye Qingqiang Wu Xinyun

Sun Zunqiang Weng Chengguang Dong Weitao

### Wishing the Joint Annual Meeting of Ten Scientific Organizations Success

The joint annual meeting of ten scientific organizations, including the China Natural Science Society, the China Science Society, and the Chinese Astronomical Society, Mathematical Society, Physical Society, Geophysical Society, Geographical Society, Meteorological Society, Zoological Society, and Genetic Society, is scheduled to be held in Beijing today. In order to promote academic research, this newspaper will give a brief introduction to the general situation of each organization. However, due to space limitations, there may be omissions. We hope readers will understand.

### Moving Towards the Era of Science

— Lu Yudao

In September, there were academic conferences at the Peking Research Institute and meetings of academicians at the Academia Sinica. Following that, in October, there are joint annual meetings of various scientific organizations across the country. In the past two months, the atmosphere of science and academics has permeated the country. In the face of the extremely low political and economic pressure in our ancient and declining motherland, breathing this scientific air may clear our minds and allow us to consider, from a brand-new scientific perspective, how we can move towards a new era of science for the sake of our national destiny.

From a scientific point of view, there are two things that we cannot tolerate. The first is conservative feudal thinking, and the second is scattered and disorganized undertakings.

First, let's talk about ideology. The most prominent feature of scientific thought is continuous progress, what is called daily renewal. If we want to progress and surpass others, we must never be feudal and conservative. This idea is best elucidated by the theory of evolution, and it has been confirmed by every scientific field.

It seems that everyone has a bit of nostalgia, just as when we arrive at the ancient city of Jinling, everyone can't help but miss the historical sites. This kind of literati elegance is not too bad; however, the purpose of "reviewing the old" lies in "knowing the new," and the purpose of nostalgia lies in strengthening the feeling of improving the ancient motherland. This is the right way out. If nostalgia leads to sticking to the old, or even despising the new, the result will harm the motherland and push it towards the grave. This is absolutely contrary to the spirit of science. In the scientific field, today the theory of relativity has improved Newtonian mechanics, so we boldly abandon Newtonian mechanics and use relativistic mechanics; today, atomic knowledge denies Dalton's atomic theory, so we boldly no longer adhere to Dalton's atomic theory and actively intensify the study of the internal structure of the atom; even the new quantum thought, the idea of ​​wave-particle duality, the idea of ​​time-space unity, and the idea of ​​material-energy unity are ideas that are unimaginable to most of us, as long as this idea is in line with the truth, all of humanity can learn anew. This is the spirit of science; this spirit is absolutely incompatible with those who miss the former kings, curse the present for lacking the old ways, and stubbornly stick to the old ways.

This is in terms of ideology.

Secondly, another characteristic of modern science is organization, cooperation, and planning. There must be no scattering, disorganization, perfunctory following of the old ways; especially after the development of atomic research, the scientific community has fully raised the importance of teamwork. The era of individual heroes and geniuses has at least become a thing of the past in the scientific community; the future is the era of the collective. If we divide human beings into two kinds of animals, one is an animal that engages in individual activities, and the other is an animal that engages in concrete activities, then we can already see that in the near future, the human beings who engage in collective activities will view the human beings who engage in individual activities in the same way that humans view apes and monkeys - one is more advanced and the other is more backward. Recently, when scientists conduct research, even as small as a laboratory studying a problem and writing a paper, it is a collaboration of experts in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, rather than each going its own way. If this lesson is popularized to politics and society, this is the real beginning of the era of science.

The era is moving towards science; our own thoughts and actions must also be thoroughly reformed and create a new era and a new national destiny. Perhaps today's joint annual meeting of scientific organizations is a beginning.

### Overview of the China Natural Science Society

The China Natural Science Society was established in 1927 and has a history of 21 years. The goals of our society can be summarized into four items: (1) to promote the popularization of science in order to enlighten the people; (2) to develop science in order to enrich the people's livelihood; (3) to seek scientific investigation in order to strengthen the foundation of the country; (4) to conduct scientific research in order to advance culture. After more than 20 years of efforts, our society has more than 2,000 members. The general office is located in Nanjing (address: Central University), and there are branches in major cities at home and abroad. The current chairman of the board of directors is Wu Youxun, and the general secretary is Shen Qiyi.

The work carried out by our society in recent years includes the following six items:

(1) *Scientific World* Journal: Founded in 1931, it has now published 17 volumes. It is the earliest comprehensive journal in our country to popularize scientific knowledge. During the difficult period of the Anti-Japanese War, this journal continued to be published in the mainland without interruption. After the restoration, it moved to Shanghai for publication. It has systematically introduced the progress of modern scientific knowledge, and has published two special issues on "Atomic Nucleus" and "Aviation." A special issue on "Radar" will be published on the Double Ten Festival to commemorate the joint annual meeting of scientific organizations.

(2) *Science and Technology in China* (English bimonthly): During the Anti-Japanese War in our country, transportation between the rear and overseas was blocked, and most of our country's scientific publications were suspended. Our society felt that scientific exchanges between domestic and foreign countries should not be interrupted, so it cooperated with the British Cultural Committee to have our society edit *Chinese Science* (*Acta Brevia Sinenssa*) to report on the progress of Chinese science. It was published in London by the British Cultural Committee and distributed to the British and American scientific communities. This work did not end until the end of the war. After the restoration, we believe that the progress of our country's science and construction undertakings needs to continue to be reported overseas, so we have been publishing *Science and Technology in China*, an English bimonthly journal, since January of this year. Five issues have been published. (3) Publication of *Science Abstracts and Articles from Microfilm*: In the later period of the Anti-Japanese War, our country and the coast were occupied by Japanese invaders. Foreign scientific books and publications could not be sent to China. The governments of the United Kingdom and the United States gave us scientific book films, but it was very difficult to read these films. In order to solve this difficulty, our society retyped and compiled important documents in the book films into *Science Abstracts*, which were divided into three disciplines: "Physics," "Biology," and "Engineering," for the reference of the scientific community in the rear to strengthen our country's resistance to Japan. This work ended after the victory.

(4) Reporting Scientific News: In today's era of rapid scientific progress, it is necessary for the people to understand scientific progress. The most effective way is to report scientific news in newspapers. After the restoration, we cooperated with the Central News Agency to start this work. Scientific news has been continuously reported in newspapers for two years, and many newspapers have published it, which has been very effective.

(5) Organizing Scientific Lectures in Various Places: In order to spread scientific knowledge, branches distributed throughout the country regularly organize scientific lectures, show scientific films, and publish scientific supplements to popularize scientific knowledge.

(6) Organizing Scientific Expedition Teams: During the Anti-Japanese War, the investigation of resources in the rear was closely related to supporting the war. In 1940, our society organized a scientific expedition team to Xikang to investigate agricultural, forestry, industrial, and mineral resources. In 1942, it organized a Northwest Scientific Expedition Team to Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai. The investigation reports have been drafted and sent to various parties for reference.

### Overview of the Chinese Genetics Society

The Chinese Genetics Society was established in November 1944. During the Anti-Japanese War, most of the universities and academic institutions in the southeast moved to the rear. In 1944, the China Science Society held a joint annual meeting of seven scientific organizations in Chengdu. At that time, scholars from Chengdu and Chongqing academic institutions and universities engaged in genetics teaching and research jointly organized the Chinese Genetics Society during the joint annual meeting of the seven scientific organizations. At present, the society has more than 100 members.

### Overview of the Chinese Physical Society

The Chinese Physical Society is an academic organization formed by Chinese physicists. It has a history of seventeen years.

The purpose of the Chinese Physical Society, as stated in its charter, is simply "to promote the progress and popularization of physics." Therefore, the development of society affairs is also aimed at this goal. Currently, there are four committees under the board of directors: (1) *Journal* Committee: Responsible for the editing and printing of the *Chinese Journal of Physics*. This journal is dedicated to publishing research papers by Chinese people on physics. Four volumes were published before the Anti-Japanese War. It was temporarily suspended for some time during the Anti-Japanese War. It was resumed in 1944, and three more volumes have been published since then, with two to four issues per volume. This journal is circulated abroad, and its papers are often cited. *Science Abstracts*, a monthly publication in the United Kingdom, also collects materials from the papers published in this journal. (2) Nomenclature Review Committee: Entrusted by the Ministry of Education to review the translation of physics terms. More than 1,000 terms have been reviewed and published by the Compilation and Translation Bureau, and more than 1,000 terms have been reviewed and are awaiting publication. (3) Teaching Committee: Discusses the teaching problems of physics in Chinese universities and middle schools. At this annual meeting, physics teachers from middle schools in Beijing will be invited to attend the meeting to discuss the teaching of physics in middle schools. (4) *Applied Physics Compilation* Committee: Responsible for compiling and printing in Chinese the functions of physics in application. This is an irregular publication, and the target readers are domestic middle school and university students and people who are generally interested in physics. This complements the specialized works of the *Chinese Journal of Physics* mentioned in the first item to achieve the purpose of the society to popularize physics and promote its progress.

In addition to the work of the society, a general meeting is held once a year. Papers are read and society affairs are discussed at the meeting. Before the Anti-Japanese War, national members gathered in one place every year, and such grand annual meetings were held five times, twice in Beijing and once each in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Nanjing. After the Anti-Japanese War, due to inconvenient transportation and difficulty in gathering, the method of holding annual meetings in separate regions was adopted, and they were held separately in Chongqing, Kunming, Chengdu, Meitan, Guilin, and other places at the same time every year. After the victory, this regional method is still adopted. This year, we are here to participate in the annual meeting of ten scientific organizations, which is limited to members in the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou area. Other regional annual meetings are being held at the same time in Beijing, Xi'an, and other places. In addition to the annual meeting once a year, there are also regular group discussions and irregular lectures. The Shanghai branch is particularly enthusiastic about these two tasks.

The Chinese Physical Society has also represented the Chinese physics community at several World Physical Societies. This time, the World Physical Society was held in the Netherlands, and we also sent representatives to attend.

At present, the Chinese Physical Society has three branches: Beijing, Shanghai, and Xi'an, with a total of 560 members, 9 honorary members abroad, including the Indian physicist Raman, and 18 group members. The current chairman of the board of directors is Yan Jici, the vice chairman is Rao Yutai, the secretary is Zhou Peiyuan, and the accountant is Shi Ruwei.

### Overview of the Chinese Astronomical Society

The Chinese Astronomical Society aims to promote the progress and popularization of astronomy. It was proposed in the early years of the Republic of China. At that time, because there were few people interested in astronomy, the formal organization was temporarily put aside. The name of the Astronomical Society was used to publish a monthly magazine to call on comrades. On October 30, 1922, it was officially established. It has been 26 years since then, and a total of 22 annual meetings have been held, with a total of 688 members. The activities it has carried out are briefly described below.

(1) Compiling and Translating Astronomical Books: In the early years of preparation, a periodical was first published, named *Guānxiàng Cóngbào* ("Observational Reports"), published once a month. The first issue of the first volume was published in July 1915. It was published until the third issue of the seventh volume in October 1921, when it was discontinued due to lack of printing funds. It was republished in July 1923, renamed *Guānxiàng Huìkān* ("Observational Compilation"), and soon stopped again. It was changed to an annual report, named *Bulletin of the Chinese Astronomical Society*. The first issue was published in 1924. After publishing to the eighth issue, it was changed to an irregular publication. It has now been published to the ninth issue. In July 1930, the monthly magazine was restored and renamed *Yǔzhòu* ("Universe"), which has continued to this day. It has now been published to the sixth issue of the eighteenth volume. At present, the *Bulletin* and the *Monthly* are published in parallel, and the nature of the two is slightly different. The *Bulletin* mainly publishes research papers by members of the Society, and occasionally publishes important translations; the *Monthly* mainly publishes popular astronomical works, and reports on the news of the universe. In addition, there is a *Variable Star Observation Report*, published by the Variable Star Observation Committee. There is also a *Member Newsletter*, published every six months, which specializes in publishing society news.

(2) Compiling and Editing Astronomical Terminology: In December 1930, the Astronomical Terminology Compilation Committee was established, with member Zhang Yuzhe in charge. In 1933, more than 1,400 terms were sent to the National Compilation and Translation Bureau for publication. The annual meeting in 1937 resolved to request the National Compilation and Translation Bureau to revise the astronomical terminology, and member Chen Zungui was responsible for it. Soon, more than 6,100 terms were obtained, which were sent by the National Compilation and Translation Bureau for mimeographing and distribution to the members of the Astronomical Terminology Compilation Committee for review. On October 31, 1942, an astronomical terminology discussion meeting was held, which determined the standards for the selection of terminology and passed the translation of each term. In 1947, the National Compilation and Translation Bureau hired a clerk to assist Mr. Chen in sorting out the terminology. The initial work has now been completed, but there are still some problems that need to be finally reviewed at this annual meeting before they can be determined. It is expected that it can be published this year.

(3) Observing Stars: At the third annual meeting in 1925, it was resolved to establish a Variable Star Observation Committee. However, due to various difficulties, it was not established for several years. At the seventh annual meeting in 1929, member Zhang Yun proposed the case again, and the conference resolved to establish it immediately. The committee was temporarily located in the Guangzhou National Sun Yat-sen University Observatory. The members were scattered in various places, but most of them were in Guangzhou. The members in Guangzhou borrowed the telescope of the Guangzhou National Sun Yat-sen University Observatory for observation; the members in other places borrowed the telescopes of the local observatories or prepared their own telescopes for observation. The observation results were sent to the committee for publication. The committee publishes an observation report every two months. Every two years, the observation results are compiled and published in an annual report. The report is also exchanged overseas with international academic organizations on a regular basis.

(4) Connecting Research: For the promotion of all scientific research, it is necessary to observe each other to encourage each other, and to help each other to increase efficiency, so that collective opinions can become systematic. The Chinese Astronomical Society also connects with all parties for research based on this purpose. For example, all domestic astronomical institutions are group members; the preparation for solar eclipse observation was initiated in 1934. Teams were formed to observe the solar eclipses in 1936 and 1941. As for the communication between the Chinese astronomical community and the international astronomical community, we also do our best. For example, members were sent to attend the second, third, and fifth sessions of the International Astronomical Union; members were also sent to participate in the astronomical group of the fourth Pacific Science Conference.

(5) Academic Lectures: When it was located in Beijing, there were academic lectures every month, which lasted for several years without interruption. After the association moved south, the lectures were stopped, but they were still held every year at the annual meeting or at appropriate times.

(6) Rewarding Astronomical Writings: Two kinds of anonymous prizes and Tanyuan prizes are established to reward astronomical writings. The anonymous prize has been awarded once in 1927 and 1933 respectively. The first purpose of the Tanyuan Prize is to subsidize the travel expenses of Chinese people attending the International Astronomical Union; if the government has officially sent personnel to attend, then this award will be used to reward research on ancient Chinese astronomy, so it has not been awarded to this day.

### Overview of the China Science Society

The China Science Society was founded in Ithaca, USA, in 1914. It was initially named the "Science Society" and published the *Science* magazine, which has reached 30 volumes to date. In 1915, it was formally established, and the name was prefixed with "China" to give the English name: "Science Society of China." Its purpose is "to connect comrades, study academics, and jointly promote the development of science in China," and its motto is "to investigate things to gain knowledge, and to use knowledge to promote life." In 1917, it was approved by the Ministry of Education for registration. In 1920, the Science Library was established at the society's location in Wenderli, Xianxian Street, Nanjing. In 1922, the Institute of Biology was founded in Jing She. In 1929, the China Scientific Book and Instrument Company was founded on Moore Road, Shanghai, and later moved to Zhongzheng Middle Road. To this day, it is the leader of the Shanghai printing industry. In 1931, the Mingfu Library, located on Shaanxi South Road, Shanghai, was completed, and all the books were stored there. Not long after, the new building of the Nanjing Institute of Biology was also completed. In 1933, the *Science Pictorial* was founded, which has reached 14 volumes to date. In 1937, when the pirates ravaged the southeast, the general office moved west to Beibei, Sichuan. Despite the hardships and turmoil, we struggled forward. Biological research continued uninterrupted. *Science* magazine continued to be published, and three annual meetings were held. The Shanghai office relied on the Shanghai comrades and the staff who remained in the office to painstakingly protect it from harm. The Shanghai Comrades Association was particularly united and shared the new challenges. The Nanjing office was burned to the ground and sacrificed for the country. In 1945, it was approved by the Ministry of Social Affairs for registration. After the war, the Nanjing office returned, but the Institute of Biology was forced to stay in the Shanghai office because the Nanjing office's land was forcibly occupied by villains. In 1947, the Radio-Electric Experimental Institute was added. In the same year, the first annual meeting after the victory was held in Shanghai. Seven scientific organizations participated. The Science Society resolved to change the English translation to "Chinese Association for the Advancement of Science," abbreviated as "C.A.A.S." This year's 26th annual meeting will be held in six regions. The Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou region will jointly hold the meeting with ten scientific organizations, the North China region will jointly hold the meeting with eight scientific organizations, and the Central China region will jointly hold the meeting with five scientific organizations. The other regions, such as Northwest, Southwest, and South China, are also actively preparing for the meeting. At present, there are seven units: the general office, the editorial department, the Mingfu Library, the Institute of Biology, the *Science Pictorial* department, the Radio-Electric Experimental Institute, and the China Science Company. There are more than 3,000 members.

The society currently has a board of supervisors (directors), with Mr. Weng Wenhao as the chairman of the board; and a board of directors, with Mr. Ren Hongjun as the chairman of the board (i.e., the president). The staff includes a general secretary, currently held by Mr. Lu Yudao; the director of the Institute of Biology is Mr. Bing Zhi, and the director of the Science Library is concurrently held by Mr. Lu Yudao. The editor-in-chief of *Science* magazine is Mr. Zhang Mengwen, and the editor-in-chief of *Science Pictorial* is Mr. Yang Xiaoshu. The editor-in-chief of *Society Friends* is Mr. Yu Shiyuan. There are a total of twelve staff members.

### Overview of the Chinese Geophysical Society

Geophysics is the science of studying the physical phenomena of the earth, sea, land, and air, and its applications. In order to promote the progress and popularization of this science in China, domestic workers initiated the organization of the Chinese Geophysical Society in the spring of 1947. It was formally established in August of the same year and approved by the government for registration.

The society currently has 54 members. The chairman of the board of directors is Chen Zongqi. It publishes the *Chinese Journal of Geophysics*, which is published twice a year. The first issue of the first volume has already been published. The journal follows the usual practice of specialized journals in various countries and publishes articles in any of the three languages: English, German, and French.

### Research on Chinese Geography and the Geographical Society of China

— Zhang Qiyun

The Geographical Society of China is a national organization founded in the capital in the twenty-third year of the Republic of China. The first annual meeting was held in Lushan, Jiangxi Province, in the summer of the same year, and the "Journal" was founded at the same time, publishing profound research papers. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the society moved west to Chongqing with the government, and the "Journal" has not been interrupted over the years. Last year's annual meeting was held in Shanghai, and this year's return to the capital is the first time since the war. At the beginning of the country's arduous creation, it is time for scholars to contribute their efforts. The members of this society are attending the meeting with a spirit of self-reflection, self-encouragement, and active progress.

Modern academics value specialization, and the division of labor is becoming more and more detailed, resulting in richer harvests. This society was established after the September 18th Incident. In the short span of ten years or so, after on-the-spot investigations and painstaking research by the majority of experts, in the field of geography in our country, in all departments such as natural geography, biogeography, human geography, historical geography, and geographical education, there are many brilliant flowers and beautiful fruits. Not only do people outside of this field often not pay attention to them, but even our own comrades may not be able to fully understand them. Recently, Professors Ren Meie and Xu Jiangzhi have written lengthy reports on the new gains in this period, which have been published in the "Science" magazine (Volume 30, Issue 4) and the "Journal of Geography" (Volume 14, Issues 3 and 4) respectively. Of course, what they introduced are only representative works, not the whole picture, but after reading them, we seem to see the magnificence of the river and the forest of sails, which is really exciting. The papers submitted by the comrades at this annual meeting, I believe, will be even more brilliant than in previous years. Collective efforts and mutual learning to jointly promote the progress of this field is the main significance of the society.

Reading about the geographical societies of various countries in the world can be roughly divided into four categories. Taking the United States as an example, the Association of American Geographers, the National Geographic Society of Washington, D.C., and the National Council for Geographic Education can be cited as examples. The Association of American Geographers, founded in 1904, is a kind of trade association. Most of its members are experts who teach at universities or work in research institutions. It publishes four volumes of the journal each year. The number of articles is not large, but the standard is extremely high. The inaugural address of the newly elected president each year is far-sighted, reflecting on the past and looking to the future, and indicating the direction of academic research. Abstracts of the papers presented at the annual meeting are also published, which can truly be called a treasure trove of literature. The New York Geographical Society, founded in 1852, is the oldest. Its membership scope is wider and is not limited to experts. It has a spacious clubhouse, a complete library, full-time staff, and a very visionary editorial plan. Its "Geographical Review" quarterly is the world's first-class forum, and the authors are authoritative scholars from all over the world. Most of the papers are specialized research and are rich in reference value. Various departments of the federal government regard this journal as essential reading, and it is of great benefit in solving major domestic, foreign, economic, and national defense issues. In addition, the society also publishes a series of books and maps, making many contributions. The "National Geographic Magazine" published by the National Geographic Society of Washington, D.C., is a monthly magazine with rich illustrations and texts. Since its founding in 1899, it has long been deeply rooted in the people. Each issue sells more than one million copies. It is truly a spiritual food that is widely read in every household. The richness of its color plates is unparalleled in the world, and it is the largest educational magazine in the world. Because of its prosperous development and abundant economy, the society has the financial resources to organize large-scale expeditions, such as the discovery of the North Pole, the investigation of glaciers, the surveying of the deep sea, and the exploration of the stratosphere, all of which have made valuable contributions to science. As for the National Council for Geographic Education, as the name implies, it is related to school education. Its "Journal of Geography" is published monthly. The content is in-depth and easy to understand. All discussions on teaching materials, teaching methods, and library equipment are constantly updated, with the aim of promoting geography teaching in primary and secondary schools.

At the beginning of the establishment of the Geographical Society of China, the President Weng Wenhao and the Directors Zhu Kezhen and other gentlemen did indeed have a grand vision. We wanted to take the capital as a base, gather the minds and efforts of comrades from all over the country to promote Chinese geography, so as to advance in parallel with the geographical societies of European and American countries. We once planned to raise funds, build a clubhouse, and collect books to facilitate the advancement of the society's affairs. However, due to the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War and ten years of displacement, it was difficult to fulfill our initial wishes due to the environment. To only ask about cultivation and not about harvest is the attitude that scholars should hold. We firmly believe that if we can work diligently and concentrate our contributions, it will not be difficult to gain the appreciation and sympathy of society over time. Due to the encouragement of the government and the support of the broad masses of the people, the distant vision of that year will surely gradually become a reality. At present, the nature of this society is similar to that of the Association of American Geographers. No matter how the society's affairs develop in the future, the reading of papers and the editing of the "Journal" will ultimately be the basic tasks of a society. And the holding of the annual meeting is the key to reviewing the society's affairs and exchanging ideas, which is of utmost importance.

The current mailing address of the Geographical Society of China is the Department of Geography, National Central University, Nanjing. The current Chairman of the Board is Hu Huanyong, and the Secretary-General is Ren Meie.
