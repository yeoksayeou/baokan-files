### Sun Ke Announced at a Reception for Legislators: Policy Guidelines Are Being Drafted, Scheduled to Be Presented to the Legislative Yuan on the 31st

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] The wartime cabinet, not yet formally established but already operating in practice, has held several informal meetings. Participants include the President and Vice President, as well as the Ministers of National Defense, Transportation, Finance, and Foreign Affairs, and influential cabinet members such as Weng Wenhao, Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Lisheng, and Chen Lifu. All important decisions will first be discussed and decided upon by this small group in order to expedite matters.

[United Press, Guangzhou, 27th] Chairman Song stated to a United Press reporter today: "The report by a certain foreign news agency that the five southern provinces are splitting from the central government in order to oppose communism is clearly false. Since the government is already anti-communist, all anti-communist factions should wholeheartedly support the government; this goes without saying."

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 27th] Authoritative sources declared on the 27th: Sun Ke's new cabinet has already begun earnestly discussing the issue of war and peace with President Chiang. Although a final decision has not been reached, the main focus of the new policy has apparently been identified as "continuing the war until an honorable peace is achieved." This new policy of "fighting for peace" is considered a compromise between those who advocate immediately resuming political negotiations and those who advocate fighting to the end until the communist party is completely eliminated. Observers believe that under the new policy, there will be no immediate efforts to reopen peace talks, but rather a wait-and-see approach will be adopted, waiting for an opportune moment.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] The policy guidelines of Sun Ke's cabinet, outlining key principles, will be presented to the Legislative Yuan this Friday (the 31st). This policy, beneficial to the country and realistically feasible, is currently being drafted. This was announced by Sun at a tea party held to welcome legislators at 4:00 PM on the 27th. Sun, accompanied by Vice President Wu Tiecheng, held a tea party on the 27th to welcome all legislators. In his impromptu speech, he first stated that he and Vice President Wu were now standing in new positions to welcome their colleagues from the Legislative Yuan. He also mentioned that in this cabinet reshuffle, some positions within the new cabinet were held by members of the Legislative Yuan. He hoped that in the future, the legislative and executive branches could have more understanding and connection with each other in order to revitalize politics. Sun also stated that his decision to form a cabinet was like being drafted into military service. Given the current difficult situation, he should not give too much consideration to personal matters. Sun also asked the legislators to excuse any shortcomings. Vice President Wu Tiecheng then gave a speech, also hoping that colleagues in the Legislative Yuan could strengthen their ties with the Executive Yuan in order to collectively support the crisis situation. The new President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, Tong Guanxian and Liu Jianqun, then gave their thanks. The event ended at 5:00 PM.

Although both Vice Ministers Liu and Ye have resigned, they are being persuaded to stay.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] The newly appointed Minister of Industry and Commerce, Liu Weizhi, took office at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 27th. Former Minister Chen Qitian personally handed over the office and introduced Liu to all the ministry's staff and gave a speech.

(3) Regarding mining, he will assist the production of mines in various regions and facilitate transportation. (4) Strengthen administrative efficiency.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 27th] After taking office on the 27th, the Minister of Industry and Commerce, Liu Weizhi, has appointed Huang Tiezheng as the Chief Secretary of the ministry and Lu Xuezhen as the Director of the General Affairs Department.

It is reported that he has telegraphed this intention to the new Premier of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke. When meeting with reporters this morning, Mei stated that he was extremely surprised by the new appointment because he was unaware of it beforehand. He only received a telegram from the Chinese government last night urging him to take office. He immediately telegraphed Premier Sun, expressing his inability to accept the new position. He believes that he is not suitable for this position, especially under the current circumstances. Mei is scheduled to leave Japan by ship for Shanghai before the middle of next month, carrying thirty boxes of records and documents from the International Military Tribunal.

Xiao Zhengzhi, Director of the Donglai Islands Administration Bureau, told reporters today: "The Donglai Islands have implemented a planned economy, allocated land, and enabled everyone to be employed, embarking on the path of socialism." He also stated: "The implementation of government policies on the island is particularly smooth because the bandit army's massacres and struggles were too tragic. The 25,000 residents suffered greatly and have a deep impression of it. Shandong has been allocated 11.3% of the fishery relief supplies. If they are received as scheduled, they can be used for the fishing season next spring. Minister Gu has agreed to allocate 100 tons of grain to maintain the fishery season during the lean winter months. Two thousand men and women have been organized on the island into self-defense forces to patrol and guard, integrating police and defense. In the few months since the administration was established, the old appearance has gradually been restored on the ruins created by the bandit army." Xiao will return to the island by ship tomorrow.

[Further Telegram] Soviet aircraft frequently conduct reconnaissance activities over the Donglai Islands. The area extends to 38 degrees north latitude. At times, there are more than a hundred aircraft. Fishing boats drifting to Lushun are detained by Soviet gunboats and handed over to the bandits to transport military supplies to Yangjiaogou.

### National Troops Launch Fierce Attack on Tanggu, Recapture Xinhe Station and Advance Towards Junliangcheng, Large Numbers of Naval Vessels Reinforce the Tanggu Area

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 27th] The military situation in North China, after two weeks of contact and evolution, has developed into a situation where the National Army is firmly defending the three points of Beiping, Tianjin, and Tanggu. Judging from the military strength of both sides, the focus of the National Army is clearly in Beiping, followed by Tianjin, and then Tanggu. However, the Communist army's military strength is focused on the outskirts of Beiping, followed by Tianjin. In recent days, the seven columns of Lin Biao and Nie Rongzhen have rushed to the outskirts of Tanggu, with the intention of first occupying this gateway and then slowly plotting for Beiping and Tianjin. For the past few days, Tanggu has been firmly defended by the Youth Army, traffic police, and other units, with the support of the navy and air force, and has not been shaken. The bloody fighting between the two sides is more intense than in Beiping and Tianjin. It is speculated that in order to reverse the declining morale caused by the failure to overcome the defenses, the Communist army will likely adopt its three-stage tactic of "encirclement, approach, and bombardment" to deal with the National Army. According to military news, Huidui and Yangliuqing in the suburbs of Tianjin have been recaptured by National Army troops.

[Our Dispatch from Tianjin, 27th] Military News: Before dawn on the 27th, the National Army in Tanggu launched a fierce attack on the Xinhe Railway Station-Beitang line north of Tanggu. The bandits retreated in panic. The National Army recaptured Xinhe Railway Station and continued to advance towards Junliangcheng. On the line from Honglou to Wanniannan south of Dagu, the 9th Column of the bandits launched a fierce attack on the morning of the 26th, but was ultimately repelled by the combined air and land forces of the National Army.

[Our Dispatch from Tianjin, 27th] Naval vessels are continuously arriving in Tanggu to reinforce. According to relevant sources, more than sixty large and small vessels have arrived successively on the 25th and 26th, and the situation in Tanggu has changed dramatically.

[Our Dispatch from Tianjin, 27th] There has been no close combat in the Tanggu area. Both sides are busy deploying, and a major battle is about to unfold. After the naval reinforcements arrived, the strength of the National Army was greatly increased. On the morning of the 27th, it began to actively bombard the bandits, putting great pressure on the Communist army.

[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 27th, 6:30 PM] Semi-official news: A powerful fleet of the National Army arrived along the coast of Tanggu this morning. The ships were equipped with heavy artillery and have already opened fire to assist in the battle. The Communist army attacking Tanggu is showing signs of retreating.

[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 27th, 6:30 PM] The fighting in Tanggu reached its climax from the 26th to the morning of the 27th. The artillery fire from both sides was fierce, and a large number of shells fell into the Hai River. Many civilian houses in the Tanggu area were destroyed. Dagu East and West are still firmly defended by the National Army. The battle on the outskirts of Tianjin is still shrouded in uncertainty, and the National Army is carrying out necessary deployments.

[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 27th, 7:30 PM] Military News: A unit of Lin's bandits launched a fierce attack on the National Army positions on Shandong Road south of Daogou in southwest Dagu, Jiudaogou northeast of Tanggu, and Xinhe Railway Station on the morning of the 26th. The National Army infantry, with the assistance of naval artillery fire, fought fiercely with the bandits all day long. The bandits launched more than ten waves of attacks, suffering more than 3,000 casualties. The fighting subsided at night. This morning, they continued to fight with the bandits at the original positions. The sound of artillery fire in Tanggu was deafening, and the order was good.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] The arrival of a strong National Army navy in Tanggu has quickly reversed the tense situation in the Tanggu area, placing the garrison in an extremely advantageous position. It is understood that the number of large and small naval vessels that have arrived in Tanggu in recent days is at least 60. The Supreme Commander, synthesizing the situation on the battlefield, told reporters in an excited and joyful tone that the National Army has now completed all preparations. Our army has dug an unprecedentedly large grave for the bandits. Under these circumstances, we welcome Lin's bandits to come and die.

[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 27th, 6:30 PM] The city defense works of Beiping have been completed after continuous construction in recent days. After 8:00 AM today, the National Army searched the western suburbs, making contact with the bandits in Wanluzhuang, Xiyuan Airport, and the Wanshou Temple area. After a fierce battle until 11:30 AM, the bandits were unable to withstand the attack and retreated. The battle situation turned quiet.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 27th] The North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters issued a statement today regarding the military situation outside Tianjin: (1) The National Army's infantry, cavalry, and artillery units in the suburbs of Beiping launched extensive sweeps in the suburbs in multiple directions and made smooth progress. At 6:00 AM this morning, they launched powerful searches in the areas of Quanggongcun outside Xizhimen, Xiaonanzhuang, Luodaozhuang, Huajiazhuang, Balizhuang, Gongzhufen outside Fuchengmen, and Shifangyuan, Yunhuachi, Caishenmiao, and the northern and southern arcs, 40 li outside Guang'anmen. By 12:00 noon, they had dispersed the scattered bandits and captured all the above-mentioned places, killing and wounding more than 100 bandits. Around 3:00 PM, part of the National Army advanced to Haidian, part continued to search west of Gongzhufen, and another part pursued the bandits in the Baitaan area. (2) There was no change in the military situation on the outskirts of Tianjin. The National Army search and sweep troops extending east and west of Tianjin continued to search in Xiaowangzhuang, Ludong, and Yuzhuangzi west of Tianjin, with only sporadic battles with the bandits.

### The Huidui Paper Mill on the Outskirts of Tianjin Is Still Under the Control of the National Army

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] The Huidui Paper Mill on the outskirts of Tianjin, owned by the Tianjin Pulp and Paper Company of the National Resources Commission, is still under the control of the National Army.

### War Affects the Zoo, Pitiable Animals and Birds Starve to Death

[Our Dispatch from Beiping, 27th] The war has affected the animals and birds in the Beiping Zoo outside Xizhimen. After the war on the outskirts of Beiping began, the zoo staff all evacuated to the city. The remaining monkeys, wolves, cranes, dogs, fish, oxen, etc., cried miserably for several days, but no one paid attention to them. Only one sunflower bird was brought into the city. The rest have probably all starved to death. The little remaining livestock in the zoo have now disappeared.

### Personal Account of the Communist Areas on the Outskirts of Beiping, Reported by an Associated Press Reporter

[Associated Press Correspondent Leon, Beiping, 27th] The most obvious difference between the National Army defending Beiping and the Communist army besieging it seems to be the hats they wear. The Communist army wears thick, large leather hats, which proves that the Communist army was transferred south from the icy and snowy Northeast. Apart from the leather hats, the National Army and the Communist army have many similarities. Both sides have the same skin color and uniforms, are very young, have good spirits, are equipped with fully automatic weapons, and are very flexible and sensitive. The Communist army political officer whom the reporter met some days ago was the opposite of a typical tight-lipped and suspicious figure, and was very talkative. The first batch of Communist soldiers that the reporter met asked several questions: "Is the reporter an American reporter who is afraid of being regarded as a reactionary and being arrested and shot by the Communist army?" "Are you married?" "Have you been to the Soviet Union?" One Communist soldier pointed to the reporter's coat and asked: "Isn't this American-made?" The reporter replied: "Yes." The Communist soldier picked up an American carbine and said: "This is also American-made."

Small shops behind the Communist army's front line are still operating as usual. Due to the lack of paper money, business is slow. The price of bread is 20% lower than in Beiping. The government's currency continues to circulate in the Communist area. The power of Yenching University is still supplied by the Communist army. A Communist political worker said: "If the power lines are restored, the Communist army is willing to supply Beiping with electricity." Undoubtedly, this statement contains propaganda. The reporter's personal impression is: if General Fu Zuoyi's brave and skilled Inner Mongolian cavalry has a fierce battle with Lin Biao's troops, then the beautiful scenery of Beiping will become bloody, and many palaces, temples, and parks in Beiping will be destroyed. This is an irreparable loss to the world. Many Chinese people do not believe that the Communist army will risk bombarding the ancient capital, regardless of condemnation at home and abroad.

### Airlifters Shuttle Between Beiping and Nanjing, Transporting Personnel from the Educational Community

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 27th] The Air Force continues to maintain the excellent tradition of leaders taking the lead. On the 24th, the first C-46 landed at the new Tiantan Airport in Beiping, personally piloted by Captain Yi Fu-en, the "King of Airlift." After Yi landed, he also tested the takeoff, and was satisfied with the hardness and length of the runway. For the past two days, flights to Beiping have been hindered by the weather. Today, the sky over Beiping cleared, and the C-46 airlifters have begun to transport members of the educational community south according to the prescribed number.

### Trolley Cars Resume Service in Beiping

[United Press, Beiping, 27th] Trolley cars have resumed service in Beiping yesterday. The authorities have also guaranteed that tap water will be supplied as usual from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day starting today. These are two major pieces of good news for the besieged residents in recent days.

### Yu Guozhen's New Position Announced, Appointed Deputy Supervisor of the North China Party, Government, and Military Inspectorate

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 27th] The Deputy Supervisor of the North China剿總 (Bandit Suppression Headquarters) Party, Government, and Military Inspectorate has been announced today. Yu Guozhen, former Mayor of Tangshan, has been appointed.

### More Than 40,000 Landmines Buried Within Ninety Li Around Tianjin, Food and Coal Prepared for Half a Year

[Our Dispatch from Tianjin, 27th] The highest military authorities in Tianjin stated today that 40,000 landmines have been buried within ninety li around Tianjin, forming an unparalleled minefield. It will continue to be strengthened in the future. Tianjin has prepared food and coal for half a year, so there is no need to worry about the bandit's encirclement.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] Chen Changjie, Garrison Commander of Tianjin, announced at the weekly meeting of his unit on the 27th: More than 40,000 landmines have now been buried around Tianjin, and will continue to be strengthened. This measure is not for dead defense, but to control the area with landmines and eliminate the enemy with firepower. Chen also stated: The troops defending Tianjin completed the construction of the inner and outer lines within a few days and repelled the enemy, overcoming the crisis. Due to the calm deployment, the bandits knew that it was difficult to retreat. However, we cannot be complacent because of small victories. We should work harder, be more vigilant, and be prepared to annihilate the bandits at any time. Chen concluded by saying: The productive enterprises in North China, some for thirty or fifty years, and many for sixty or seventy years, are all the achievements of our ancestors' arduous efforts. Everyone should protect them. As for the demolition of houses in Yixingbu and other places on the outskirts of Tianjin, it was caused by the excessive enthusiasm of a small number of troops in defending Tianjin. He deeply regrets this. The refugees in the area have been specially allowed to enter the city defenses and are being assisted by the municipal government.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 27th] The Political Work Office of the Tianjin Garrison Command announced on the 27th: Since the start of the Tianjin defense battle, the number of bandits captured by us is as follows: 139 officers at the regimental level, and 154 privates. As of the 27th, the number of bandits who surrendered with their weapons and have been reported by various units is 3,360. Those who have not yet been reported are being counted.

### Huaihai Snow Stops, Air Force Active: Airdropping Food to Support Du Yuming's Troops

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The snow in the Huaihai war zone stopped on the 27th. Airplanes have been dispatched to airdrop food to support the troops of Du Yuming's army corps. According to a military source, it is imperative to launch airdrops of food to Du's corps and similar beleaguered units. Bread baked by bakeries in major cities like Nanjing and Shanghai, plus cooked beef slices, would be even more suitable for airdropping. If the current mobile warfare is strengthened through control from various aspects, then for the food supply to troops trapped in bandit-controlled areas, innovation must be strived for.

[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] Liu Bocheng and his communist troops seem to have disappeared recently, and the Nationalist generals responsible for defending Nanjing and Shanghai are speculating about their whereabouts.

[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] Military transportation in the capital is frequent today, with more troops arriving than leaving. It is generally believed that the capital will be transformed into a battlefield. Judging from recent troop movements, the Nationalist army seems poised to hold the Nanjing-Shanghai area indefinitely, with the main line of defense set up in Jiangnan, starting from Wuhu in the west and deploying along the railway line. Furthermore, according to news from northern Jiangsu, fierce fighting continues north of Gaoyou.

[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] According to news from Zhenjiang: Armed village teams are being organized along the Nanjing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways to protect railway bridges and tracks. Village patrols will conduct continuous patrols from 6 PM to 6 AM the next morning. All ships approaching within three miles of important bridges will be fired upon.

### Liu Zhi Inspects Various Agencies in Bengbu

[This Newspaper, Bengbu, 27th] After a fresh snowfall here, Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi, accompanied by Hu Fo, Deputy Commander of the Suppression in the Jiangsu-Anhui-Henan Border Area, inspected various agencies in Bengbu and the defense areas of various stationed troops today.

Editorial

### The Brewing of an Eastern Alliance

Recently, British and Australian officials, in light of the increasing severity of the Asian crisis, have been advocating that East Asian countries should organize an international organization similar to the Western European alliance, to resist and prevent the communist labor force from sweeping across the entire Asia. According to a United Press report from London on the 25th: British and Australian officials who are directly concerned about the development of the Far East situation, because they have seen the rapid development of Soviet forces in the East, strongly advocate that East Asia also needs an organization similar to the Western European alliance to resist aggression. The reason they hold is that China is about to split, and President Sun has also declared that the Chinese government will consider making peace with the CCP. The past concept that a unified China could constitute an anti-communist fortress has also been shattered. Therefore, a divided China will allow the CCP to control the resources of the north, gradually turning its gaze toward Hong Kong; coupled with the recent developments in Malaya, Burma, and Indonesia, the fear of Asian redification will also become an imminent reality.

The British and Australian officials' view of the Asian situation is quite correct. The fear they have about the future of Asia is not alarmist. The proposal they put forward to organize an East Asian alliance to resist aggression is also wise. But unfortunately, in terms of timing, it is inevitably a mistake to be too late. Because the so-called "Far East anti-communist united front" and the so-called "Asian Marshall Plan" have long been familiar to the people of Asian countries. Moreover, when the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East met in Launceston, Australia, earlier this month, Indian representative Tysoe also shouted loudly at the meeting, demanding that the United Kingdom and the United States quickly implement an Asian Marshall Plan similar to the European Recovery Program in Asia. Why did the British and American representatives turn a deaf ear? In particular, the mistake they will make is to think that they might as well wait for China to be redified before organizing an Eastern Alliance to deal with the future redified China!

We must know that even if the Eastern Alliance can be put into effect under the advocacy of the United Kingdom and Australia, there should be two prerequisites for it to be an effective organization for resisting aggression and preventing redification:

First, the Eastern Alliance is meaningless without China's participation. Open the map of Asia. The geographical importance of China cannot be ignored by anyone. During the Second World War, the reason why the United States was able to turn defeat into victory against Japan was because China's arduous resistance was consistently unyielding, which was a decisive factor. Even after the war, when the world strived to create world peace, it was universally recognized that China's position in Asia was important. In the United Nations Security Council in Asia, only China is a permanent member. On the one hand, it shows that China bears a particularly heavy responsibility for Asian peace. On the other hand, it can also be seen from this the importance of China's position. Any consultation on Asian issues cannot find a solution without China's participation; especially regional security mechanisms related to the safety of the entire Asia, cannot be without China's participation. But strangely, when we look at the motives of the United Kingdom and Australia in advocating the Eastern Alliance, it seems that they want to place China outside the Alliance. Therefore, we can assert that the advocacy of the Eastern Alliance will not have any success without China's participation! This level of significance must be well known to British and Australian officials. At the beginning of advocating the Eastern Alliance, this fact must not be ignored.

Second, the revival of Asia will not succeed without the full assistance of the United States. Before World War II, most of the countries in Asia were colonies of the West. Whether it was her industry and commerce or other aspects, they were relatively backward. However, after the baptism of blood in World War II, on the one hand, they were stimulated by the world trend, and on the other hand, due to the awakening of national consciousness, they successively demanded independence, freedom, unity, and liberation, resulting in a turbulent phenomenon after the war. From Korea in Northeast Asia to Indonesia in Southeast Asia, there is almost no land of peace. War, hunger, and cold have made the people of Asia live in dire straits. Therefore, to seek the revival of Asia, it is necessary to obtain the full assistance of the United States. As Indian representative Tysoe said. "If Asia does not have a Marshall Plan similar to the European Recovery Plan, communism will inevitably win the entire victory in Asia!" Based on this, if the United Kingdom and Australia's advocacy of the Eastern Alliance is to become a reality, it must obtain the support or acquiescence of the United States.

In short, we agree with the suggestions of the United Kingdom and Australia in principle, but we still hope that British and Australian diplomats can face up to the reality of Asia and make comprehensive plans, and must not be short-sighted, only knowing how to plan for themselves, while forgetting the entire Asia. For the present plan, if we want to promote the realization of the Eastern Alliance, then in the active aspect, we should emphasize to the world the importance of aiding China; in the passive aspect, we should immediately stop creating sources of chaos in Asia, and should especially advise the Netherlands to immediately order a ceasefire.

### Exposing the True Face of the Communist Party: U.S. House Committee on Un-American Activities Publishes Q&A Booklet

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] The U.S. House Committee on Un-American Activities, after ten years of research into communism and the American Communist Party, has recently published a booklet in a question-and-answer format, exposing the general situation of communism and the American Communist Party. The translation is as follows:

(1) (Q) What is communism? (A) Communism is a system which a small minority uses, hoping to conquer the world.

(2) (Q) Have any countries in the past become communist countries through free elections? (A) No.

(3) (Q) How then do the communists attempt to seize power? (A) They adopt any possible means, whether legal or illegal. The first victory of communism was through a bloody revolution. Since then, every victory of communism has been through military conquest, internal corruption, or related threats. "Conspiracy" is the basic method used by the Communist Party in the countries it attempts to conquer. "Iron pressure" is the basic method used by the Communist Party in the countries it has already conquered.

(4) (Q) If the Communist Party gains power in the United States, what will happen? (A) The capital of the United States will be moved from Washington to Moscow. Every man, woman, and child will be under the strict control of the Communist Party.

(5) (Q) Will my life be better then than it is now? (A) Absolutely not. The following seventeen answers will explain everything.

(6) (Q) Can I freely join a labor union then? (A) Under a communist system, all labor unions are run by the government, which is controlled by the Communist Party. At that time, the union will never be able to get you higher wages, shorter working hours, or better working conditions. The Communist Party will only use the union to oppress you.

(7) (Q) Will I be able to change my job then? (A) No, you can only work where you are assigned and receive the wages prescribed by the government.

(8) (Q) Will I be able to go to school then? (A) You can only go to schools prescribed by the Communist Party. You are not free to enter any other school. You can enter any school as long as the Communist Party allows it, and only to that extent. You can only read what the Communist Party allows. You can only hear what they allow. As long as it is within their control, you can only know what they allow you to know.

(9) (Q) Can I join the Elks Club, Rotary Club, or Veterans of Foreign Wars then? (A) No. American Communist Party leader Foster once said: "Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, all capitalist parties—Republican, Democratic, Progressive, Socialist, etc.—will be dissolved, leaving only one Communist Party—the party of the working masses. Similarly, all other groups that are not supporters of bourgeois politics, including chambers of commerce, employers' associations, Rotary Clubs, Veterans of Foreign Wars, YMCA, and various monks and sects, will be dissolved."

(10) (Q) Will I be able to own my own house then? (A) No. Under a communist system, all real estate, whether in cities or in the countryside, is owned by the government and controlled by the Communist Party. Your residence is assigned, and you must pay rent as required.

(11) (Q) Will I be able to own my own land then? (A) No. Under a communist system, the land is the property of the government, which is controlled by the Communist Party. You must farm as prescribed, and you have no right to decide when or where to sell your produce or at what price.

(12) (Q) What will happen to my insurance money then? (A) The Communist Party will take it over.

(13) (Q) What will happen to my savings in the bank then? (A) Amounts above a very small figure will be confiscated, and the remainder will be controlled.

(14) (Q) When I die then, can I leave any property to my family? (A) No, because you will not have any property to leave.

(15) (Q) Will I be able to travel freely within the country then? (A) No, your every movement must be approved by the police station in advance.

(16) (Q) Can I join a church then? (A) In the Soviet Union, the Communist Party has used every means to destroy religion for the past thirty years. Since they have failed in this regard, they are now using religion from within. The Communist Party is now applying this same strategy in the United States.

(17) (Q) Can I start a business and hire people to work for me then? (A) Doing so will be a crime, and you will be severely punished.

(18) (Q) Can I teach what I like to teach in an atmosphere of "academic freedom" then? (A) You can only teach everything that the Communist Party orders you to teach. If you have any other intentions, you are simply courting destruction or imprisonment.

(19) (Q) Can I freely conduct scientific research without government interference or restrictions then? (A) Police and detectives will watch your every move. If you are found to be doing anything that violates orders, you will be liquidated.

(20) (Q) Can I freely make friends then? (A) No, you can only make friends with those approved by the Communist Party. From birth to death, your life is controlled by the Communist Party.

(21) (Q) Can I travel abroad or marry a foreigner then? (A) You cannot take such action unless with the permission of the Communist Party.

(22) (Q) Can I correspond with friends in other countries then? (A) You may try it under postal and telecommunications censorship—and only try it once.

(23) (Q) Can I vote to remove the Communist Party then? (A) Please examine the political achievements of the Communist Party in other countries and the fact that communism is taking effect within the U.S. government, and you will find that it is impossible.

(24) (Q) Does the Communist Party not promise a better life for the poor? (A) Communist politicians around the world use every means to break down existing countries, hoping to seize power in the chaos. Hypocrisy is a trick in human history. In countries ruled by the Communist Party, please compare the promises of the Communist Party with the actions of the Communist Party."

(25) (Q) What is the difference between the promises of the Communist Party and the actions of the Communist Party? (A) When the Communist Party seeks to seize power, it promises high wages, less work, and security to protect against war and the disasters of poverty. In reality, the Communist Party has not done any of these things, whether it is in any part of the world.

(26) (Q) But doesn't the Communist Party promise to eliminate racial and religious intolerance? (A) Yes, but in fact, because of religion and race, the Communist Party has massacred tens of millions of people. Under a communist system, your race will not help you in the slightest, and religious belief will only cause you to be killed.

### The Ultimate Goal of US Foreign Policy: Seeking Freedom and Peace for the World; Anti-Communism without Inclination towards Freedom Cannot Obtain US Aid

[US Information Service, Washington, 26th] The National Planning Association recently published a statement outlining the long-term goals of US foreign policy and asserting that there is no error in the US responsibility to support freedom. The Association is a non-partisan, non-profit organization whose members are leaders from the US agricultural, industrial, commercial, and professional sectors. Its opinions on US policy are presented to the public as reference. In its foreign policy statement, the Association emphasized that "America's ultimate goal is freedom and peace in a thriving world society."

The Association stated that the current world is not as good as being at peace, and the dangers faced by this type of foreign policy must be prevented. Those who oppose Communism are not necessarily extremely enthusiastic about freedom. "Dictatorships such as Spain, Nazis in disguise in Germany, and the dissident Communists in Belgrade, who are merely opponents of Communism, do not qualify for US support." Americans must not ignore the overall plan due to current strategies, thereby damaging the ultimate goal. Each step of US foreign policy must ultimately be measured by its contribution to freedom and peace.

Foreign Policy: Nine Principles

The Association listed nine main goals of US foreign policy: (1) We solemnly declare that the ultimate goal of the United States is freedom and peace in the world, so that it will become increasingly prosperous. Freedom means recognizing the supreme importance of the individual. A free society must allow individuals to enjoy freedom in feeling and in fact. (2) The pursuit of freedom must continue. This pursuit can only be successful when a community of free nations is truly in existence. In order to maintain its own freedom, the United States must maintain the freedom of others. All free nations must receive full assurance that the United States cannot fully fulfill its responsibilities and strive to maintain freedom, and other countries must also understand this point at all times. When the United States fulfills this responsibility, it must include the amount of military aid it should include, which must be decided as soon as possible. We should not regard the problem as purely military in nature or primarily military in nature. For example, there are some countries in Europe that, if their resources are used excessively for military purposes, will not only fail to promote security, but may even provoke resentment. US assistance, if biased towards military aspects, will not be as effective as shipping food and providing assistance to the civilian economy. (3) "Countries that currently enjoy free systems and seek to encourage the pursuit of freedom must have an organization and interact with each other so that their economies, living standards, and lifestyles can be expanded in a stable and orderly manner. The closest possible economic and political integration of Western Europe must receive all possible encouragement from the United States. The effective unity of Western Europe must still be supported as the ultimate goal of the people everywhere. (4) Since the goal of US policy is the freedom of the individual, it can never compromise with those who advocate or practice oppression. Opposing one method of oppression cannot be used as proof of dedication to freedom. The price of this expedient is very likely to become an irreparable damage to the moral status of the United States." (5) The same strict principles must be observed regarding domestic freedom. The deprivation of freedom caused by poor education, poverty, and racial discrimination must continue to be eliminated. We must especially prevent regression. During times of tension, it is often easy to view the reduction of individual freedom as reasonable. This will sacrifice the values ​​that the United States is responsible for protecting. (6) Freedom cannot be separated from responsibility. The responsibility of leaders in a tense world is extremely important and may not be understood by the American people. One of the costs of isolationism is that domestic enemies are often valued more than foreign enemies. For the sake of domestic political interests, the interests or prestige of the country are sacrificed. In this context, necessary assistance to friendly countries may be labeled as "selling out America," and the motives or even patriotism of the initiator may be criticized. Similarly, attitudes and actions such as sacrificing friendship with other countries in exchange for limited domestic interests through tariffs, quotas, and embargoes can no longer be tolerated. (7) Freedom is not necessarily linked to a particular form of economic organization. However, those who believe in individual freedom have completely different ideas about the state's position in economic affairs. Part of the strategy of American policy must be to acknowledge that others may also be right. For example, the reasonableness of Western European democratic socialism is no less than that of American democratic capitalism. (8) It is fortunate that free countries now possess most of the world's resources (especially undeveloped resources). The important strategic goal of the United States remains to fully develop and utilize these resources. (9) The United States must explain to the world that the group of free countries is not closed off and excludes others. Any country that respects individual freedom and desires peace can join. The ultimate goal of US policy is a constantly expanding group of free countries. The statement signed by prominent members of the association includes Association Chairman Mr. Amusingki, President of Sony Corporation, Mr. Ardutchel, General Manager of American Investment Corporation, Mr. Golden, Labor Counselor of the Economic Cooperation Administration, Mr. Kling, President of the American Farm Union, Mr. Moufei, editor of the famous magazine, Mr. Beckett, secretary of the American Quaker Service Committee, and Mr. Luer, chairman of Macy's Corporation.

### The Inauguration of the Eighth General Assembly of the First Session of the Municipal Council; The Speaker Loudly Appeals: Save Shanghai, Save the Country; The Battlefield is Only a River Away; Major Rescue Cases Awaiting Discussion; The First Meeting will be Held this Afternoon

[Reported by this newspaper] The Eighth General Assembly of the First Session of the Municipal Council was solemnly inaugurated at 9:50 AM yesterday at the council's headquarters on Tanggu Road. The speaker, Mr. Pan, the deputy speaker, Mr. Xu, and 159 councilors attended. Mayor Wu, Garrison Commander Chen Daqing, Party Committee Chairman Fang, directors of various municipal bureaus, and guests Cha Liangjian, Ni Bi, Tao Baichuan, Jin Longzhang, Wei Rulin, and others, totaling more than 30 people, were present. After Speaker Pan delivered the opening speech, Mayor Wu, Commander Chen, and others delivered speeches successively. Finally, Councilor Tong Xingbai delivered a response. The opening ceremony concluded at 11:30 AM. The scheduled first meeting was postponed to 3:00 PM this afternoon due to lack of time. Mayor Wu will deliver a policy report and councilors will ask questions and provide answers. At the beginning of the conference, Speaker Pan delivered an opening speech, saying: Time flies so fast. Today is the date for our council to convene its Eighth General Assembly. I still remember when the Seventh General Assembly was held in September, it was at the beginning of the currency reform, and the price limit policy was vigorously implemented. However, due to the central government's financial policies, which have been changed again and again, the country's financial resources and social wealth have been greatly affected. As for the military situation in the suppression of the rebellion, the national army has withdrawn from the Northeast and Jinan. After the Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign, it has evolved to this day. In East China, the two sides are facing each other north and south of the Huai River. In North China, the two sides are fighting in the suburbs of Pingjin. The seriousness of the overall situation and the volatility of society are even more incomparable to three months ago.

The current city of Shanghai is only separated from the main battlefield by the Yangtze River, and it is almost facing the front line, rather than the so-called rear. At this time and in this place, we are gathered together. I firmly believe that everyone must be alert, and they must put aside their trivial matters and concentrate their efforts to discuss several major cases to save the critical situation. Looking at the overall situation of the country and the recent situation of the city, I, Gongzhan, would like to briefly mention one or two abstract points based on my personal feelings and teach them to the officials and colleagues. As for how to realize our expectations, it is up to the meticulous discussion of the colleagues of this council.

### People's Representatives Should Examine the Importance of Their Responsibilities and Do Everything Possible to Save the Difficult and Dangerous Situation

In terms of the overall situation: Since the CCP launched an armed rebellion, it has evolved to this day, almost making most of China's dragon army in the smoke of gunfire, sorrow, and mist. When the government and CCP representatives held talks three years ago and the Political Consultative Conference afterward, the government did not start without longing for peace, but it failed due to the CCP's stubborn adherence to its own views. Even General Marshall's goodwill mediation was ultimately unable to do anything, leading to an unprecedented catastrophe that has become increasingly fierce. Recently, on the eve of President Sun's inauguration, he said "continue to fight until a glorious peace is achieved." However, the CCP's arrogance is rampant and there is no response. It is expected that it will still rely on its brutal "human wave tactics" and poisonous "rumor offensive," believing that it can ultimately control the entire China, destroy the precious culture, and achieve its goal of dragging it into the "Iron Curtain." Peace is originally a two-way thing. The CCP's attitude is like this, alas my compatriots, are they still willing to be sacrificed as straw dogs for the war created by the CCP, and do they not want to find a way to extricate themselves? However, the country is owned by the people, and the people are the masters of the country. At this critical juncture of life and death, why don't we, the people, stand up, fully exert our own sovereignty, protect our own lives, maintain our own freedom, and just stand by and watch this war catastrophe, or just flee in a panic, and always let those ambitious people who deliberately seize power and kill the people to their heart's content, as if the country belongs to only a few of them. Then we are certainly not qualified to be the masters of the country, and the glorious peace must be unattainable.

However, the Republic of China is still the Republic of China today. We, the people, are really occupying a lofty position and have a latent great power. Especially the people's representatives should examine the importance of their responsibilities, spontaneously develop their compassionate wishes, make good use of all our strength, and go through all kinds of twists and turns, with perseverance and extraordinary efforts, to save the difficult and dangerous situation and curb the brutal violence, so that we can escape from the fire and ascend to the throne, saving ourselves and saving the country.

Shanghai and China

In terms of the city: Shanghai is the largest city in China, with a population of six million, with a concentration of industry and commerce, and developed education. Everyone knows the importance of its past, present, and future relationship with China and the world, and there is no need to say more. In the past hundred years, many national salvation movements in China have either been launched by Shanghai and received a national response, or launched elsewhere and achieved great success because of the enthusiastic assistance from Shanghai. Especially whenever there are natural and man-made disasters and cries of sorrow are everywhere, saving the dying and healing the wounded is often initiated in Shanghai. Whenever soldiers are welcomed and disasters are concluded, and there are groans and haggardness, the efforts to restore unity and peace are often achieved in Shanghai. These examples need not be listed in detail. Those who live in Shanghai are not only Chinese, but also many foreign nationals who have been doing business and preaching here for a long time. The reason why Shanghai is what it is today is that the Chinese people and foreign friends have put in a lot of effort and strength. To build a strong, prosperous, and happy China, a complete and prosperous Shanghai is necessary. To hope for a peaceful and free world, a complete and prosperous Shanghai is also necessary. If Shanghai is destroyed, China's construction and revival will certainly be a thousand times more difficult, and the peace and freedom of the world will inevitably feel a great loss. Therefore, loving Shanghai and preserving Shanghai is the responsibility of all Chinese people and the obligation of people all over the world, and the Shanghai citizens must do their best to contribute in more ways.

### Saving Shanghai is Saving the Country

Therefore, I, Gongzhan, would like to take advantage of the broadcast of this conference to advise our compatriots in the city to work together to save Shanghai. Saving Shanghai is saving the country, saving the world, and saving every individual. Standing by and fleeing are definitely not good ways. Today, we, as citizens of Shanghai, must have a kind of self-confidence, a kind of heroism, and a kind of great ambition to sacrifice ourselves to help the masses. Let us unite, serve for the local social security, do our best for the people's free life, and strive for the independence and survival of the nation and the nation. With perseverance and bravery, we dare to believe that we can change the atmosphere of the whole country and obtain the assistance of friendly countries, so that our Shanghai, our China, can pass through this difficult stage and stand firm.

### To Preserve Shanghai, We Must First Preserve China

Now many people are asking how Shanghai can be preserved. They even want to pin their hopes on friendly countries. In fact, I, Gongzhan, sincerely tell everyone that the preservation of Shanghai must rely on the efforts of our own Shanghai citizens, and the preservation of China must also rely on the struggle of our own Chinese people. This is not to say that we do not hope for the sympathy and assistance of friendly countries. It is precisely because we hope for human assistance that we must first help ourselves. Moreover, to preserve Shanghai, we must take preserving China as our main goal. If China cannot be preserved, what is the meaning of preserving Shanghai? Conversely, if we take preserving Shanghai as the starting point of our efforts and expand it to achieve the task of preserving China, the contribution of Shanghai citizens at this stage will truly be great. This conference of the Council should carefully study how to enhance Shanghai's self-defense capabilities, how to maintain Shanghai's social order, how to ensure that the city's police can eat well and dress warmly and serve loyally, how to ensure that the military has good military discipline under the premise of cooperation between the military and civilians, so that the soldiers can truly protect the people, and the people can truly respect the soldiers, how to reserve sufficient food for Shanghai, how to enable Shanghai's factories to continue production as usual without increasing unemployment, how to enable displaced refugees and exiled students to receive considerable relief, how to enable wounded and disabled officers and soldiers to have good medical care and nursing, and slightly reduce their suffering. All of these are several things that must be worked on together to preserve Shanghai at the present time. In short, to preserve Shanghai, we must contribute money and effort. We must have a great awakening to save Shanghai and save the country.

### Mayor Wu Contributes Three Sentences: Seeking Security through Self-Defense, Seeking Prosperity through Stability, and Seeking Victory through Determination

Mayor Wu said in his speech: I would like to contribute three sentences to the councilors: (1) Seek security through self-defense. At present, all public and private civil and military institutions in Shanghai are seeking stability, but escaping reality is definitely not a way to seek stability. We must exert all our strength to seek stability through self-defense. (2) Seek prosperity through stability. The end of the year is approaching, and the industrial and commercial sectors are in a state of decline. Workers feel that the cost of living is rising, but the capital side feels that it cannot afford it, and the business of shops is in a slump. To seek prosperity, we must first seek stability. (3) Strive for a peace of honor through determination. The peace I am talking about is a peace of victory. Only by seeking victory can peace be hoped for. Without a firm belief, we can never win, and there will definitely be no peace.

Chen Daqing

Chen Daqing said in his speech: Just now, the mayor and speaker both proposed to seek stability through self-defense. I believe that self-defense must be organized, and the power of the collective must be exerted to achieve the goal. I am a new friend of Shanghai, and what I can contribute is only this.

Ni Bi

Ni Bi said in his speech: The CCP's rebellion, although said to be due to the international background, is taking advantage of the weakness. We cannot deny the existence of various unreasonable phenomena such as corruption, absurdity, and shamelessness in the current government. Shanghai is the source of sin, especially the central financial institutions stationed in Shanghai. The Yangshi Company case, which was noisy for a while, has no follow-up, which has caused a lot of misunderstandings. Just based on the various war materials published in the newspaper, it can be confirmed that there are indeed many illegal things in it. If they are allowed to get away with it, it will be a disservice to the people and will definitely lose people's hearts. Therefore, I believe that the most solid defense belongs to the psychological one. All illegal enjoyment and theft of ill-gotten wealth should be brought to justice. The joy on Christmas Eve fully demonstrates the disparity between the rich and the poor in Shanghai. The Shanghai Council is the most righteous and hopes to play a leading role.

Cha Liangjian

Cha Liangjian said in his speech: In this big city of Shanghai, it is fundamentally impossible to seek the complete eradication of crimes. Due to economic, political, and social factors, there are currently five to six thousand criminals in prisons. Compared with the entire population of the city, the number is certainly not large, but it is a great burden on the government. Due to the shortage of the national treasury, the central government has repeatedly ordered to find ways to disperse them, but the security authorities are always trying to seek social stability. If a general release of criminals with habitual crimes would undoubtedly be a major threat to security. Therefore, I hope that the Eighth Council will discuss this issue and debate it.

Fang Zhi

Fang Zhi said in his speech: I believe that peace talks are all rumors spread by the communist bandits. If the government compromises, it will be fooled by the communist bandits. The so-called glorious peace is to strive for victory, and compromise is suicide. But we want to enable the soldiers at the front and the troops defending the local area to fight bloody battles, and we must first make them well-fed and warm. Therefore, the work of comforting them must be carried out with all our efforts, and I hope the council can explore the greatest strength.

### Tong Xingbai Delivers a Reply on Behalf of the Councilors

Finally, Tong Xingbai delivered a reply on behalf of the councilors, saying: At the opening of this Eighth General Assembly, we have been greatly inspired by the valuable insights of the Speaker and the Mayor. We must face reality and find a solution, and we will never escape. I believe that there are two major problems that need to be solved urgently at present: (1) In terms of economy, the gold exchange method should be improved urgently. Whether its policy is reasonable or not has a great impact on people's lives. Most of the gold currently sold by the government is taken from the people of Shanghai, and due to the unreasonableness of the policy, dozens of people in Shanghai have died due to the rush. It can be seen that the economic policy has a significant relationship with people's lives and local security. I hope that a reasonable solution can be discussed in this council, which will be a major gain of this meeting. (2) In terms of military affairs, although military command belongs to the authorities and the people cannot go to the front to fight, if everyone sticks to their posts and works hard indirectly, they can also exert their greatest strength. I hope the Council can play a leading role, and the Eighth Council will definitely have the greatest gains.

### 790 Bodies Recovered from the Jiangya Wheel

### Family Symposium Yesterday Agreed on Six Points

Yesterday at 1:00 PM, the second family symposium was held, attended by more than 800 family members of the victims. Mr. Shen Zhongyi, Deputy Manager of China Merchants Bureau, was also invited to attend. Although the mood at the meeting was extremely sad and indignant, they tried their best to restrain their emotions. The discussion resulted in: (1) The captain of the ship, Shen Dacai, should be guaranteed by the China Merchants Bureau not to escape. (2) The search for floating corpses will be rewarded with a heavier reward to encourage fishermen. (3) Plan for temporary emergency relief for poor families of victims in Shanghai. (4) Family members who have not yet recovered their corpses and wish to inspect overseas can first register with the General Affairs Group, and the China Merchants Bureau will send another ship to inspect them. (5) Urge the China Merchants Bureau to quickly dispatch ships to resume navigation on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. (6) It is scheduled to hold the third symposium at 1:00 PM on January 3.

In addition, the entire committee of the association believes that Zhang Hanting, the owner of the tangerine boat, rescued fellow passengers and his bravery is commendable. A reception will be held at the association on January 2. At the same time, Wang Shitang, the captain of Huafu No. 1, and Zhang Deqing, the captain of Huafu No. 2, managed by China Fisheries Company, who sent the rescue telegram first, will also be invited to comfort them on the same day.

### Stock Exchange Reopening Uncertain; Announces Dismissal of Employees

Employees Refuse to Accept and Demand Relief

Since the Shanghai Stock Exchange suspended operations, there have been repeated requests to reopen, but without success. Wang Zhixin, general manager of the Stock Exchange, announced today a plan for employee dismissal, stating that reopening is uncertain and maintaining the exchange is very difficult. Employees who voluntarily accept dismissal will receive a severance payment of 3,000 to 3,500 yuan for ordinary staff, and 2,000 to 3,000 yuan for laborers. Those who do not wish to be dismissed will have their salaries frozen at the November amount and do not need to come to the office. The November salary for ordinary staff at the exchange is only just over 600 yuan. The exchange's association of colleagues believes that this meager severance pay will not be enough to maintain their future lives, and unanimously refused to accept it. They have sent representatives to General Manager Wang Zhixin and Chairman Du Yuesheng to request relief. Furthermore, stockbrokers and employees of the exchange are also in the process of dissolving and changing professions.

### Wusong Police Station Officers Punished for Accepting Bribes

[Our Reporter] Yuan Xingcan, an officer at the Wusong Police Station, discovered on July 26th of this year that Cao Peifu, the owner of the Xie Xingchang Rice Store at the intersection of Wusong's Wai Ma Lu and Zhongxing Road, was smuggling rice out of the country.

### Endangering the State; Charges Not Established; University Student, Female Reporter, and Others All Declared Not Guilty

[Our Reporter] Wang Shuiquan, Ju Yishi, Ju Tongkui, Yu Shujian, students of Datong University, and Qian Wei (also known as Qian Weizhu), a female reporter of the Free Forum News, were accused of endangering the state. Yesterday, the Special Criminal Court declared them not guilty. The reasons for the verdict are extracted below: "On June 5th of this year, some students in the city participated in a collective parade against the United States supporting Japan. The Municipal Police Department sent the arrested 54 people to this court for interrogation. Wang and the other five, as well as Tao Dazheng and Wang Zuqi, whose whereabouts are unknown, were charged with violating Article 2, Section 1 of the Emergency Regulations for Punishing Crimes of Endangering the State. However, the defendants Ju Yishi and Qian Wei firmly denied participating in the parade. The defendant Ju Tongkui and Yu Shujian stated that they were arrested while preparing to participate. Only the defendant Wang Shuiquan admitted to participating and had a picket certificate. The other evidence against Zhou Yishi is two reactionary publications, but it cannot be actively proven that they were sent by his brother Zhou Gengshi. Although the collective parade against American support for Japan may have been manipulated by the Communist Party, the defendants either claimed to be at the scene for other reasons and did not participate, or admitted to participating because they mistakenly believed its purpose to be pure. The original indictment lacked concrete evidence to prove whether the defendants had any criminal intent. Even if they knowingly participated in the parade, it is not enough to constitute the above crime."

### Over 100 Industrial Loans Approved; Over 30 Million Yuan Loaned; Decision to Improve Methods for Purchasing Finished Products

[Our Reporter] To date, the Central Bank has approved over one hundred emergency industrial loan cases, totaling more than 30 million yuan in loans. Furthermore, the Central Bank has formulated several supplements to expedite the application procedures for manufacturers in order to acquire finished products. The fourth meeting of the Production and Export Business Loan Review Committee of the Central Bank's Rediscount Association was held at the Central Bank from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM on the 25th. Over ten people including Zhang Ziyue attended, chaired by Lin Jin, to discuss 85 applications for the acquisition of dozens of industries such as machinery, electrical machinery, metal products, automobile materials, hygiene materials, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, leather, papermaking, weaving, and matches. Excluding those rejected and those instructed to apply for loans through banks or financial institutions, 40 cases of finished product acquisition were approved. After the prices are assessed on Monday, the manufacturers will be notified to negotiate with the designated national bank and treasury. In addition, the committee believes that many manufacturers are still unclear about the purpose and procedures of this finished product acquisition. Therefore, although the committee is striving for speed, the coordination in all aspects is still insufficient. In order to improve this, three methods have been decided and will be implemented immediately:

Three Methods

(1) All approved acquisition cases will be handled according to the following procedures: (A) After the acquisition of finished products is approved, the Rediscount Association will notify the manufacturer by phone or in writing to immediately prepare all procedures and send personnel to the meeting when the Evaluation Committee meets. (B) After the Evaluation Committee assesses the price, it will fill out a valuation form in triplicate, one copy will be given to the manufacturer who attended the meeting, and the other two copies will be sent to the Central Bank's Business Bureau and the handling bank for processing. (C) After the manufacturer has agreed to the assessed price, they should expedite the procedures with the bank. If the price changes due to delayed transportation, they may not request a reassessment. If the procedures are not completed within three days of the price assessment, it will be deemed as a voluntary abandonment. (2) Manufacturers who have already been approved for the acquisition of finished products will not be accepted if they apply to acquire other finished products within three months after the previous case was approved. (3) Applications for the acquisition of finished products or mortgage loans from factories that are partially relocated, preparing to relocate, or whose factory负责人 have left Shanghai, affecting production and laying off workers, will not be reviewed, and the handling banks and financial institutions will be requested to conduct thorough investigations in advance.

Various Loan Cases Approved

The 20th meeting of the Rediscount Association was held at the Central Bank at 11:00 AM yesterday, with over ten committee members in attendance, chaired by Liu Gongyun. The meeting discussed multiple loan cases reviewed by the industrial, mining, agricultural, and trade advisory committees last week. Excluding those rejected and those requiring further investigation, ten cases related to transportation and public utilities, five cases of industrial production, and two cases of export trade were approved. In order to promote the export of foreign trade materials and earn foreign exchange, the committee decided that export business loans should be handled through foreign exchange swaps with a term of 30 days, which may be extended by 30 days if necessary. The designated bank will handle the loan, and the Central Bank's Audit Office will conduct strict audits. If anyone is found to be profiting from the loan, the designated bank's license will be immediately revoked.

### Controlling Resources is Extremely Abundant, National Bank Decides to Continuously Dump Fake Currency, Implementing Tight Monetary Policy to Crack Down on Speculators

Since commodity prices in the city started to stir on Friday of last week, the Central Bank, in order to tighten the money supply and crack down on speculators, has dumped a large amount of gauze on the market. This selling policy is still continuing as of yesterday morning. The person in charge of the bank told reporters from the United Press yesterday morning: The recent fluctuations in commodity prices are entirely the result of manipulation by a small number of speculators. The National Bank has decided to fully cooperate with the local authorities' political power to give them a head-on blow, ensuring that speculators have no way to use their skills. He also stated that the resources currently controlled by the National Bank are extremely abundant and sufficient for long-term sales.

Another report: Yesterday, the money supply in the market turned loose again. The source of funds became prosperous due to the arrival of floating capital from other places. Although the demand notes were redundant, the turnover was quite easy. The market interbank lending rate hovered around 15 yuan per day, equivalent to 4.5 cents per month, with the highest being 18 yuan, and excessive orders reappeared near noon.

Since yesterday, until the Chinese New Year's funding on January 5 next year, there has been frequent searching in the market, with the highest bid reaching 25 yuan per thousand yuan, mostly around 22 yuan. It is said that the supply of funds is still relatively abundant, so it is not very difficult.

Cash chips were quite popular yesterday, with extremely urgent demand outside the industry. Internal banks and dealers, however, saw a significant reduction in the balance of deposits in the central bank due to a large number of deposit withdrawals in recent days. It is said that after the atmosphere of a standstill in the current situation disappeared, the southward flow of funds from this city became prosperous again, so large banknotes of 50 yuan or more continued to be discounted.

### Prices in Production Areas are Weak, Rice Prices Tend to Decline Again, Sales are Stagnant and Prices Plummet by Hundreds of Yuan

Yesterday, the rice market turned to decline again. Because the price rose too much last Saturday, the prices in the production areas were weak, and people's hearts were very empty. The street's appetite was quite light, sales were greatly stagnant, and because the arrival of goods was quite prosperous, the owners took advantage of the high price to sell, and the price plummeted by hundreds of yuan. By the close of the market, it was heard that the prices of goods outside the industry had risen, and the removal of goods had become active, rising by 10 to 20 yuan. White japonica rice retreated to 455 yuan (South City), a decrease of 90 yuan, and Book Daog and early rice fell by about 100 yuan each. In the North Rice Market, white japonica rice was 460 yuan, and early Book Daog rice all fell by about 100 yuan. There were quite a lot of arrivals yesterday, totaling 18,480 dan and 5 dou in the North and South markets.

Flour

First weak and then up, the morning opening was also down because the rice price was reported to be down, and people's hearts were very empty. Later, because the prices of goods outside the industry rose, retail investors and the street had to take it. The old car powder opened at 200 yuan and closed back to 215 yuan, the warship powder closed at 210 yuan, the red bee returned to 200 yuan, the construction became 199 yuan, and the large package bran also fell first and then rose, closing at 131 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

All rose sharply, the yellow soybeans were flat at the beginning, but later, because the oil cake rose, they also rose sharply. Pinghu special rough was up to 380 yuan, a total increase of 20 yuan. Corn and red rough Qingdao gang absorbed fiercely, and the prices all rose by more than 10%. Yuan wheat rose sharply by 20%, and sesame rose madly, and raw peanuts rose by 60 to 70 yuan.

Cooking Oil

The initial opening was slightly lower, because the rice price was reported to be low, the initial soybean oil spot price was once 1,460 yuan, but later, because the prices of goods outside the industry rose, people's hearts were greatly excited, retail investors sucked hard, and the market rose linearly to 1,680 yuan, a mad increase of more than 200 yuan. Raw vegetable oil closed at 1,600 yuan, also up 180 yuan, and Ji barrel raw oil rose 200 yuan to 1,700 yuan. Soybean cake also rose 15 yuan due to the Shantou gang's taking.

[This newspaper's news] The method of stopping cooking oil from being transshipped from Shanghai to various ports south of Shanghai has been announced by the Jianghai Customs from yesterday to be exempt from continuing to be implemented.

### Foreign Exchange Certificates Soar, Overseas Remittance Rates Continue to Rise

The market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates continued to soar yesterday. The initial opening price in the morning was 80 yuan to buy, but there were no transactions. Then it rose to 85 yuan before a few transactions occurred. The number of settlement amounts for kerosene and water feet was frequent, and the market price rose to a high of 90 yuan, and the transaction was extremely prosperous. The closing feet were still hard, and the final transaction was 91 yuan to buy and 92 yuan to sell, a sharp increase of 15 yuan and 25 cents.

Moreover, the overseas remittance rate continued to rise to 80 yuan yesterday, a sharp increase of 10 yuan compared with last Saturday. The International Department of the Bank of China has received a large number of remittances from abroad in recent days, which is rare in the past.

### Sugar First Flat Then Popular

The sugar market was first flat and then popular yesterday. Later, because the prices of various goods outside the industry rose, people's hearts rose, and the bid price stepped up, and the upward trend continued to be sharp. The No. 45 car white essence opened at 800 yuan in the morning. In the middle, the buying atmosphere was extremely strong, the supply and sale turned scarce, and the lifting surface was holding up endlessly, once as high as 900 yuan. Near the close, the loose retail investors' willingness to leave was slightly tight, and the price softened slightly. As a result, it closed at 890 yuan, an increase of 100 yuan. Coarse sand rose by 80 yuan, and Xinghua white factory snow white and large sugar all rose.

### Tea Market's Foothold is Firm

Yesterday's tea market, although in the tight money supply, the market saw that production and storage were scarce, and because the cost of replication was increasing day by day, the idea of lifting was evolved again.
