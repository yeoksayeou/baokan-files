[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The proceeds from the sale of enemy and puppet property nationwide will form part of the gold yuan issuance reserve, amounting to a considerable sum. According to cleaning-up agencies in various locations, the total value of enemy and puppet property already cleared and with confirmed ownership, ready for immediate sale, reaches 332.74 million gold yuan, equivalent to US$83.185 million. This excludes over 50 million gold yuan of enemy and puppet property in the Northeast region already valued and awaiting sale, as well as a large amount of enemy and puppet materials that can be processed and sold to finalize cases, all of which are not included. Therefore, the total value of the proceeds from the sale of enemy and puppet property nationwide will exceed US$100 million. Of the currently estimated 330 million gold yuan of enemy and puppet property, real estate accounts for the largest proportion, approximately 70% of the total. Regionally, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui area accounts for the most, reaching over 150 million gold yuan. The Hebei-Tianjin area accounts for over 87 million gold yuan.

The measures are as follows: (1) If the provincial government proves that the enemy and puppet materials received and used by local agencies were indeed for official use at the time, and the quantity and value are not significant, the handling agency shall be allowed to close the case at its discretion. (2) If the quantity and value of enemy and puppet materials received and used by local agencies for official use are substantial, the handling agency shall compile the case and submit it to the Executive Yuan for deduction from subsidies to local finances or approval for additional budget transfers to close the case. (3) Enemy and puppet materials received by various agencies but not yet used shall still be handed over for processing. (4) Enemy alien property received by local agencies, which after repeated investigations, or due to the passage of time, changes in leadership, reorganization, cancellation, or the absence of original inventory lists or receipts for verification, remain untraceable, shall be listed and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval of write-off.

(B) Regarding how to value and account for enemy and puppet property received by various agencies and military organizations according to law, and how to urge collection and finalize cases, proposing measures: (1) Factories and equipment allocated to state-owned enterprises for operation shall be listed by the handling agencies in each region and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The valuation standard shall be transferred and finalized by the end of this year. Any profits earned over the years shall also be documented and handed over to the handling agency for transfer to the national treasury. (2) Enemy and puppet property received by various government agencies and military organizations, which has not been transferred for handling or valued for liquidation, shall be strictly reviewed to determine which must be retained and which are unnecessary. Those that must be retained shall be transferred and accounted for at the assessed value within a limited time, and those that are unnecessary shall be ordered to be transferred for handling.

(C) Regarding the request for expedited transfer procedures for enemy and puppet property received and retained by various agencies.

Subsequently, the Second Review Subcommittee report was discussed, and He Hao-ruo's opinion was used as the conclusion for the handling of enemy and puppet property in Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places, serving as a principle for handling enemy and puppet property in those areas. He Hao-ruo stated: "The situation in Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places is indeed unique, but compared to the Northeast, it can be said to be a relatively favorable place. Funds from the Northeast entering through the port will inevitably pass through Tianjin and seek an outlet. If they can be properly guided, they may be brought back on the right track. If the enemy property houses that are highly suitable for reuse are fairly priced and buyers are guaranteed the right to manage them, they will be happy to purchase enemy and puppet property. If local agencies feel limited by their own authority, a supervisory committee for handling enemy and puppet property should be organized in each area, composed of local senior military and political leaders, responsible for supervising the implementation of bidding, sales, and clearance. The handling agency should have the courage to take responsibility and boldly proceed." Finally, the "Draft Measures for Accelerating the Sale of Enemy and Puppet Real Estate" proposed by the Third Review Subcommittee was also revised and approved.

[Another Dispatch] He Hao-ruo, Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling Enemy and Puppet Property, in order to strengthen the handling of enemy and puppet property in various regions and supervise the rapid sale of enemy and puppet property in those regions, is scheduled to depart around the 15th of this month to inspect and supervise various locations across the country. He Hao-ruo's itinerary will first take him to Qingdao, then to Tianjin and finally to the Northeast. He will return to Nanjing in early next month and then inspect Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and southern China. According to He Hao-ruo, he will handle this enemy and puppet property with a spirit of great fearlessness. The enemy and puppet property in the foreign concessions in various places must be sold first, and he will complete this work with the greatest determination within six months.

### Weekly Forum: The Kuomintang and the Status Quo in China

— Mao Zi-shui

It has been over twenty years since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing. During these twenty-plus years, except for the last year, the central government of China has nominally been led by the Kuomintang (KMT). However, internal strife and foreign aggression have emerged one after another, the people's livelihood has deteriorated daily, and the national situation has become increasingly precarious. As a result, most people who discuss national affairs criticize the KMT. Even the more enlightened members of the KMT believe that they are duty-bound and have brought this upon themselves.

I believe that to determine the KMT's responsibility for the current state of China, we must first understand the source of this state. The most recent, greatest, and most obvious reason for the dire situation our country is in now is, of course, the civil war. Because of the civil war, transportation has been disrupted, land has been devastated, prices have soared, and the majority of the people live in fear of going without food and clothing.

Regardless of whether the KMT government is good or bad, I have never considered placing the responsibility for the civil war on the KMT. First, the civil war in China was caused by the Communist Party's use of force to seize political power. The National Government is recognized by all countries in the world – including the Soviet Union – as the official government of China. Any government has the right to use force to suppress any rebellion, and it should do so. Second, the Communist Party's goal is to rule the world. No matter how much the central government compromises or tolerates, the Chinese Communist Party, if it is qualified to be called a Communist Party, will never abandon force and sincerely seek domestic peace. The many weaknesses in the central government are, of course, topics for the Communist Party to call for revolution. In fact, no matter how wise the government is, if it is not a Communist Party government, or even if it is a Communist Party government but does not belong to the direct line of Lenin and Stalin, it will be denounced as reactionary and overthrown by the adherents of the current Communist Information Bureau. I think honest people within the Chinese Communist Party will not deny this. Given this, would it not be too unjust if we placed the responsibility for the civil war on the National Government?

Some people believe that the prolongation of the civil war, the suffering of the people, and the central government's inability to quickly quell the chaos mean that it has lost its qualification to be a government, and that this is all due to the KMT's incompetence. I believe that there are two major reasons for the growth of the Chinese Communist Party. One is Japan's invasion of China, which prevented the central government from attending to the Communist Party. The second is the Yalta Conference, where Mr. Roosevelt misjudged people and insisted that Soviet Russia quickly declare war on Japan, resulting in that secret agreement that harmed others and benefited no one. After Japan surrendered, the Soviet Union gave the weapons it received from the Kwantung Army to the Chinese Communist forces. Such powerful bandits, of course, could not be quelled in a short period of time. If we consider the government's inability to quickly quell the chaos to be the KMT's incompetence, the KMT can also offer the following self-praise to resist our slander:

"If it were not for the efforts of the National Government, China would have been swallowed up by Japan long before the Americans defeated Japan. If the KMT did not put in a great deal of effort and take on the responsibility of the nation's survival, China might have been under the control of the Communist Information Bureau!"

A fair-minded person, if not a believer in the Communist Party, cannot completely deny this self-assertion of the KMT.

At this point, some may suspect that I am deliberately defending the KMT. I can clearly tell everyone that my motivation for writing this article is to defend the KMT. I know that this seems to be inviting public anger. Public anger is certainly terrifying, but I admire Mr. Lü Xinwu of the Ming Dynasty's saying: "Defending people against injustice and slander is the first principle of heaven." I would rather offend the public than violate the principles of heaven. If I knew that the world was unjustly accusing the Communist Party, I would also not be afraid of public anger to defend the Communist Party. (For the convenience of readers, I would like to declare that I am neither a member of the Communist Party nor a member of the Kuomintang.)

A person is often very forgiving of the shortcomings of scientists or artists when criticizing them, but when he criticizes politicians, he nitpicks and is completely unforgiving. This is really very unfair. I believe that being a politician is the most difficult thing in the world. A scientist works in the laboratory all day long, and no matter how hard he works, he always has a place to enjoy himself. A politician often exhausts himself for the sake of human progress and human happiness, and sometimes he is subjected to unexpected adversity. Only a person with great benevolence and courage would be willing to do such a thing. (The politicians I am talking about here, of course, refer to those who have a "compassionate heart for the people" and take "improving the world and educating people" as their career. Those who steal power and deceive the people to satisfy their own selfish desires are no different from thieves. Most of the warlords in China in the past were such people: they cannot be considered politicians at all.) Therefore, we should have a little extra respect for those who are engaged in politics. Of course, we should also correct the mistakes of politicians without hesitation. You must always be mindful of the hard work of the servants in your home, but you can also point out their faults. If he accidentally and unintentionally makes a mistake, you will severely punish him. I am afraid that this is not the way a gentleman treats his servants. I hope that gentlemen who talk about politics should at least have the attitude of treating servants toward those who are truly engaged in politics. That is why I do not easily scold those who are engaged in politics.

The biggest accusation against the KMT, which is why it is scolded by the world, is that it has been in power for more than twenty years, shouting the Three Principles of the People every day, and still has not done a good job for the people. This seems to be something that should be scolded. But I don't dare to scold casually. Think about it. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, there was first the revolt of the Communist forces in Jiangxi, then the revolt of Feng and Yan in the north, and soon there was the September 18th Incident, the Shanghai War, and the revolt of the "People's Government," and so on. After the July 7th Incident, the Japanese warlords wantonly invaded, and the Communist Party army took the opportunity to spread to the northern provinces. In the midst of these internal and external troubles, it would be very good if the National Government did not collapse. How can we expect it to do anything? A country bumpkin complains about everything as soon as he is unhappy. When someone steals a chicken from him, he opens his mouth and scolds the government for being corrupt. We need to have a historical perspective, so although we cannot praise the government for the current state of China, we also cannot scold it as casually as a country bumpkin.

In all fairness, in the past twenty years, although there have been some narrow-minded people in the KMT who promoted governing the country by the party, in fact, few of the heads of the National Government's administration were old KMT members. Of these people, the "social notables" were certainly unrelated to the party. Even the true party members mostly focused on the country and the people, and did not focus on the party. Therefore, from the party's point of view, the KMT has failed. From the country's point of view, although the KMT has not made any great achievements, it is at least worthy of the assessment of "understanding the big picture."

Recently, domestic newspapers and magazines have often discussed or criticized the KMT, both party members and non-party members. Many of the points are very correct, but they seem to rarely be based on a historical point of view. I am now purely from the perspective of political history to discuss the view we should take regarding the relationship between the KMT and the current state of China. I hope that our young intellectuals or old debaters, from handling family affairs to criticizing the gains and losses of political affairs, should have the heart to blame others lightly and blame themselves heavily, so as not to lose the style of a great power. Our nation has a tradition of two or three thousand years of "culture." Our political demeanor must strive to catch up with the British, or at least catch up with the Americans. Like the French, when the country is in crisis, they still fight and quarrel endlessly. We should take such a nation as a warning! Other more base and inferior nations are engaged in mutual "revolution" or "party purification" every day. We do not need to imitate them! (Sent from the Department of History, Peking University)

### Gannan Intensifies the Delivery of Military Grain; Grain Outflow Will Be Further Restricted

### Reasons for Not Prosecuting Yuan Yang'an

[Our Newspaper Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The Capital District Prosecutor's Office has decided not to prosecute lawyer Yuan Yang'an, who was implicated in the case of leaking confidential information about currency reform and selling Yongsha stocks for profit. The reasons stated in the non-prosecution decision are as follows: According to the case, the facts of the crime should be determined based on evidence, and if there is insufficient suspicion of a crime, a decision of non-prosecution should be made, as clearly stipulated in the Criminal Procedure Law. In this case, the defendant Yuan Yang'an, after being reported by the Capital Police Department as being suspected of benefiting from the opportunity of currency reform with Xu Baiqi and Tao Qiming, was sent together with Xu Baiqi and others for investigation. During the interrogation, the defendant firmly denied having jointly sold Yongsha stocks with Tao Qiming and Xu Baiqi or having taken advantage of the opportunity to make a profit. Furthermore, during the investigation by the Capital Police Department and this court, through separate interrogations and cross-examination of the testimonies of the co-defendants Xu Baiqi and Tao Qiming, it was found that they were consistent with the defendant's defense. It is evident that the defendant did not obtain any illegal gains under the instigation of the co-defendant Xu Baiqi and others. In addition, after repeated investigations by this court, there is no other evidence sufficient to prove that the defendant did indeed engage in joint profiteering. It is difficult to hastily convict him. Except for the embezzlement by Tao Qiming and Xu Baiqi, which will be prosecuted separately, the decision of non-prosecution is made in accordance with Article 331, Paragraph 10 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

### Stalemate in Atomic Energy Negotiations May Be Broken; Soviet Union Puts Forward New Proposal; Advocates International Convention; Banning Atomic Weapons and Establishing Control Mechanism to Proceed Simultaneously

[News Report] Paris, 2nd, Broadcast: There has been a significant shift in the Soviet Union's atomic energy policy, abandoning its original demand to first destroy and ban all atomic weapons before establishing an international control mechanism, and instead proposing to simultaneously ban atomic weapons and establish an international atomic energy control mechanism. On the 2nd, Vyshinsky formally suggested the drafting of two conventions, one for banning atomic weapons and one for establishing an international control mechanism, to be signed and implemented simultaneously. According to this method, the Atomic Energy Commission will continue negotiations. General observations suggest that the shift in Soviet policy is unlikely to greatly assist in promoting coordination between the East and West.

[Associated Press, Paris, 2nd] On the 2nd, the Soviet Union and its satellite countries continued to attack the United States' atomic control plan. The Yugoslav representative, Mr. Berle, accused Western countries in the United Nations Political Committee of wielding the atomic sword as a diplomatic weapon. Mr. Berle also claimed that the United States had drafted a control plan with the intention of making it unacceptable to the Soviet Union. He said that anyone with a little reason would know that the US plan was to ensure that the United States permanently maintains its monopoly on atomic bombs and is not fooled. Although the South Communist Party's henchmen have been expelled by the Communist Information Bureau, Mr. Berle's position is in line with Soviet diplomacy. He rebutted British Foreign Secretary Bevin's statement that the Soviet Union should be blamed if the world falls into an atomic war, and said that if the West rejects the Soviet Union's plan, it should bear the responsibility for all the consequences. Mr. Berle and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky also implied that the Soviet Union already possessed atomic bombs, saying, "Except for international collective cooperation, we are unwilling to give up even a shred of sovereignty. But when will large American enterprises begin to seek benefits for the world and become interested in collective cooperation? Most countries in the United Nations recognize that forcing a country possessing atomic bombs to destroy its atomic bomb stockpile is a dangerous thing. We can bet 100 to 1 that the majority will do everything possible to hinder the passage of the Soviet plan. This move creates pressure on the Soviet Union, which is generally believed not to have atomic bombs, or at least not to possess them in quantities comparable to the United States." At the end of Mr. Berle's speech, he called on Western countries to support the Soviet plan to ban atomic bombs and destroy the atomic bombs stored in American arsenals. He said that this move could save the world from falling into the abyss of war. French Defense Minister Lemari spoke next, stating that France fully supports the Belgian representative's proposal to establish a small committee with the power to conduct negotiations and strive to reach an agreement. He also issued a warning to the Soviet Union, stating that since the Soviet Union may already have atomic bombs, international control, inspection, and investigation are inevitable. Mr. Lemari said that if the United States is required to destroy all atomic bombs before an international control and monitoring system is established, this would be tantamount to transferring the atomic monopoly from the United States to the hands of swindlers. He was responding to Vyshinsky and Berle's claim that the American monopoly was an illusion. After Mr. Lemari spoke, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky angrily rebuked Mr. Lemari for adhering to the atomic policy of his American masters and rejecting his appeal. The masters of Mr. Lemari mentioned by Vyshinsky included Lilienthal, Truman, and Schuman.

### Military Aid to Western European Alliance; United States Considers New Lease Act; Agreement for US Use of Western Air Force Bases Has Been Established

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] Well-informed sources say that senior US government officials are debating whether to lease military equipment to strengthen the Western European military alliance. If those who advocate the lease plan prevail, the plan will be submitted to Congress next spring, but before that, the following must occur: (1) The organization of the Western European military alliance must be completed first. The alliance is composed of the five countries of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, and is currently meeting in London. Marshal Montgomery has been nominated as commander. (2) The alliance must determine what it needs, what military equipment it can afford itself, and what it should apply for from the United States. (3) The President and the National Security Council should determine whether military assistance is the best security arrangement for the United States. (3) Should determine what Europe can help in the US national defense. It is said that a member of the State Department is the main supporter of the lease bill, and there are also many supporters in the national military organization.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 1st] Political commentators here pointed out that the temporary military group established by the five Western European countries is neither a joint military staff nor a unified command. Its main goal is to coordinate all preparatory plans, especially the production and purchase of war materials used for the defense of the five countries. There are two other basic goals that are the work of the governments: (1) The Old Continent cannot place its defense under the complete control of the American army, but must rely on its own efforts. (2) Cooperation between Western European countries cannot be regarded as sufficient to provide the five countries with sufficient strength to guarantee their security. In the event of economic and political events, the United States must be asked for assistance. Economically, the United States is now raising huge sums of money to arm itself and to provide economic assistance to Europe, so the new lease system must not undermine either of these two goals. Politically, the new Congress' review of military assistance to Europe will be tantamount to turning the Western European alliance into an Atlantic alliance. The new Congress is about to convene to decide whether Western Europe should be defended, or only given assistance, or completely abandoned and ignored.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 2nd] According to a telegram from the "Daily Mail" Washington correspondent, the Spanish air force bases will also be included in the Western defense plan drafted by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. The United States has now negotiated with Franco of Spain, and soon the bases will be freely used by the US Air Force. According to the "Daily Mail", the United States and Spain have concluded an agreement on this matter.

### Western European Foreign Ministers to Meet at the End of This Month; Britain's Policy Towards Spain Remains Unchanged

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 1st] A spokesman for the British Foreign Office today reiterated the British government's previous statement opposing Spain's accession to the Western Alliance. The reason for this reiteration is that recent news from the United States indicates that many American military leaders believe that Western Europe needs Spain's cooperation to consolidate European defense.

### Berlin Air Corridor; Soviet Aircraft Conduct Live-Fire Exercises; Soviet Union Refuses to Establish Neutral Zone Around the City Government

The Soviet side also declared that the exercise will begin this morning and last until 6 p.m. This exercise is a public violation of the Four-Power Control Agreement. The Soviet Union announced that it would hold the exercise on the 3rd, immediately after the United States demanded that the Soviet Union stop threatening the air corridor. Yesterday, Soviet aircraft strafed ground targets in the Berlin corridor, and two other Soviet aircraft maliciously flew past a British transport aircraft, deliberately provoking a quarrel.

### Rumors of Ashida's Involvement in Major Corruption Case; Cabinet May Fall; Outcome Depends on Kurisu's Testimony

[United Press, Tokyo, 2nd] Japanese sources on the 2nd openly predicted that the Ashida cabinet would resign due to its involvement in the largest post-war political corruption case in Japan. They stated that Prime Minister Ashida himself may also be involved in the case, but this depends on the testimony of Kurisu, the Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board, who was detained on the 30th. The sources also stated that Ashida himself may be summoned for questioning, as Ashida and Kurisu have a very close friendship.

Ashida has planned to meet with Brigadier General Denna, the chief of the Allied General Headquarters government, on the 2nd. Observers believe that Ashida's visit is to explain the circumstances of Kurisu's dismissal. Observers speculate that the focus of Ashida's visit may be to discuss the cabinet's resignation to clarify the current political situation. An official of the Allied General Headquarters stated that Ashida has scheduled a meeting with Brigadier General Widener, but Widener has not been informed of the purpose of Ashida's visit. Meanwhile, Japanese observers stated that Prime Minister Ashida will decide whether to order the cabinet to resign after meeting with the two major parties supporting the government on the 4th.

### United States Strives to Clear Obstacles to International Freedom of the Press; Marshall Issues Statement Commemorating Newspaper Week

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] Secretary of State Marshall stated today that the United States government is actively working to clear obstacles preventing the free flow of news around the world. The Secretary of State's statement was issued by the State Department to commemorate National Newspaper Week, which begins today. In his statement, Marshall pointed out that half of the world's population lives under some form of censorship. Some countries implement censorship systems, and news is controlled by the government. The people of these countries are not allowed to know the truth, and their judgments are based solely on the half-truths or fabricated reports instilled by their rulers. News censorship and control are the first and most important steps for a dictator to conquer the people. The American people should always remember that once everyone has freedom of the press, their freedom will never be lost.

### Next Year's International Monetary Fund Annual Meeting Decided to be Held in Washington; France Elected as New Chairman; China, India, the United Kingdom, and the United States Serve as Vice-Chairmen

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 1st] Chinese Finance Minister Wang Yun-wu stated in his speech at the closing session of the International Monetary Fund meeting today that he recognizes the thoughtful planning of this meeting. He said that this proves the good progress made in international financial cooperation.

[United Press, Washington, 1st] The joint board of directors of the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund decided unanimously that the 1949 board of directors meeting would be held in Washington and elected French Finance Minister Ete to be the chairman of next year's meeting. The seventeen-nation party meeting of the two associations ended on the 1st, and the five-day meeting also appointed four vice-chairmen, whose candidates are as follows: Wang Yun-wu (China), Sir Deshmukh (India), Sir Cripps (UK), and Snyder (USA). The Board of Directors agreed that the 1950 Board of Directors Meeting would be held in Paris. In the resolution, the board members called for the focus in the future to be a comprehensive and open discussion of international financial issues between the board member countries. Some directors condemned the procedures of the meeting based on the fact that most of the discussion time during this session was limited to approving the policies recommended by the executive directors of the two associations. U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder praised Chinese Finance Minister Wang Yun-wu, saying that during China's economic difficulties, Wang abandoned his personal business and took on the battle as China's Finance Minister. Snyder stated at a press conference that the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund's board of directors were deeply gratified by the progress of world recovery. There is evidence of economic progress everywhere, but the world is still in a "transitional period." The overall world situation has not yet reached a level of political and economic stability.

### Incident at the United Nations General Assembly; Vyshinsky's Intelligence is Inaccurate; Civilian Map Mistaken for Military Use

[United States Information Service, New York, 1st] In a passionate speech at the United Nations General Assembly a few days ago, Soviet representative Vyshinsky mistakenly used a chart from an oil company as a "Map of the Pacific Theater of the Third World War" by the United States. The "New York Times" editorial today had the following description of it: "If this represents the intelligence that the Russians have obtained from heaven, then the quality of the spies they hire is actually inferior to those summoned by the Senate Thomas Committee. The map pointed to by Vyshinsky is not a map of the Third World War, but a map of the Second World War printed three or four years ago. Esso Company is a private company that printed it. Naturally, Vyshinsky would ask, 'If this cannot prove that the United States is planning to attack the Soviet Union from New Guinea Tarawa, what can prove it?' Vyshinsky accused the United States of planning a war against the Soviet Union. Our journalists and the "Voice of America" broadcast should repeatedly remind the people of the world that the American people are tired of any war against the Soviet Union or any other country."

Although most of the time at the Imperial Conference will be spent discussing imperial defense related to the Western bloc's defense plans, the dominions may argue that the Pacific British Empire should first have a concept of Pacific defense before deciding on its obligations to Europe.

### Sufficient Stock, No Food Worries; Management Authorities Release Preliminary Statistics; Direct Distribution of Yarn and Cloth Eliminates Market; Continued Rice Rationing, No Consideration of Price Increase; Citizens Can Buy 1.5 Zhang of Cloth Every Three Months with ID Card

[Our Report] According to the Supervision Office, preliminary statistics show that there are 6.5 million bolts of cloth and 100,000 bales of yarn in the city. In addition to self-sufficiency, there is still a surplus to supply to other areas. In the future, it is planned to gradually eliminate yarn and cloth middlemen and fully adopt a direct distribution system. When the reproduction industry needs yarn, it can directly purchase from the yarn factory without going through middlemen. When other cities and regions need yarn, they can apply to the local guild, which will then request to purchase it from the guild in this city. As for the goods needed by yarn shops in this city, they can request the factory to allocate them. In the future, citizens can buy 1.5 zhang of cloth every three months with their ID cards. This planned management can rationalize and economize the consumption of yarn and cloth.

Rice rationing in Shanghai will continue. According to Yang Chuoan, there will be no problem with the rice supply for the next four months: October, November, December. The current rice storage in Shanghai's rice industry is 280,000 dan, not including the grain stored by residents, so there is no famine in the city. As for the rice merchants' request to increase the selling price, the Supervision Office decided not to consider it. To increase supply, the Farmers Bank and the Central Cooperative Bank have been asked to purchase grain from Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other places to supply Shanghai, and consider exchanging cloth and soap produced in Shanghai for grain from other cities. Currently, there may be hoarding by large households in cities and towns everywhere, resulting in a small amount of rice coming in. In the future, after the powers of the Supervisor are expanded, the unified control of grain will be discussed with the provincial and municipal authorities to completely solve the problem of grain hoarding by large households in the short term. At the same time, the government is also planning to improve the rice distribution work of the People's Livelihood Committee.

[Our Report] Mayor Wu Guozhen visited Jiang Jingguo yesterday morning to discuss the adjustment and control of rice and cloth in the future. Supervisor Jiang convened Wu Weijing, deputy manager of the Textile Construction, Wang Qiyu, chairman of the Shanghai Textile Industry Association, Tang Zhiliang, chairman of the Cotton Yarn Industry Association, and Dong Jiufeng, chairman of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, yesterday morning to discuss the issue of controlling yarn and cloth prices. It was decided that the yarn and cloth market would be closed starting next week and a direct distribution system would be implemented. It was heard that Mr. Jiang stated on the spot that since the yarn market is supplied at a limited price, there should be no more situations in the market that do not comply with the limited price. In the future, due to the relationship of using US-aided cotton, the Central Bank should also have a large amount of cotton yarn available for supply, so the principle of yarn and cloth supply in the future will be that each factory directly distributes and sells to the cotton yarn reproduction industry, retail merchants, and distributors in other cities, etc., to avoid being affected by the yarn and cloth market fluctuations. As for the yarn and cloth industry association, if it also originally had transactions of selling yarn and cloth to other cities, it can form a small institution to plan and handle it separately. Mr. Jiang ordered the responsible persons of the yarn and cloth industry associations to quickly convene their colleagues to draft a method.

[Another News] Jiang Jingguo also received Yang Chuoan, the chairman of the Emergency Grain Purchase Committee, and Wan Molin yesterday, and decided that the selling price of rice in the city would not change, and planned to exchange industrial products for food from other regions, and major grain hoarders in cities and towns would be banned.

After the outline is drafted, it will be submitted to Director Jiang for adoption and implementation after obtaining the consent of all industry members. According to Tang, the closure of the market will affect the survival of the industry. The association is determined to formulate a proper distribution method for the authorities to use as a basis for improving industry transactions.

Therefore, the police have reported the investigation process and the number of confiscated materials to the Supervisor's Office for review. The rumors that a large number of new cars and woolen fabrics were seized are not true.

### Words of the Widow: Early Success Led to Obsession with Pleasure; Zhang Yamin Died Due to Bad Company

Wang Huiheng Unwilling to Accept Belongings, Ignores Zhang's Wife's Advertisement

[Report from this newspaper] After Zhang Yamin, the former Chief of the Economic Section of the Garrison Headquarters, was executed, he left a pen, two photos, and a handful of incense to his girlfriend "Ms. Dong." His wife recently published a notice in the newspaper addressed to "Ms. Yi," asking her to come and collect them, with mournful wording that attracted attention. Ms. Dang is known to all as the female performer Ms. Wang Xunheng, whom Zhang admired greatly during his lifetime. Three days before his arrest, he planned to divorce his wife and marry Wang. After entering prison, he still wrote poems to express his feelings, such as: "Autumn rains fall day after day, pitying the tears that gush like springs. When will we hold hands again, picking flowers and watching butterflies dance?" The feelings of love and longing are evident on paper. After Zhang's death, there was much discussion about Ms. Wang in the outside world. Yesterday, a reporter visited Zhang's wife at Zhang's residence on Xinzha Road, and saw the iron door tightly closed and the courtyard deserted. In the reception room, there was a spiritual tablet and portrait of Zhang, with dim lighting and a desolate silence. However, the vermilion lacquered pillars and the strings of red, green, and colored small light bulbs on the ceiling still evoked the luxurious splendor of the past, when guests gathered and shadows danced. Zhang's wife, described as haggard, said that Ms. Yi had not yet visited her, so she had to keep the belongings for a long time. She said that she and Zhang were classmates at the police academy and had been married for four years and had a daughter. Zhang was originally a promising young man with talent, but after coming to Shanghai, he was promoted to an important position and, becoming successful at a young age, fell into bad company and became obsessed with pleasure. She repeatedly advised him, but Zhang did not heed her advice and turned against her, calling her a "country bumpkin," thus sowing his own bitter fruit. Zhang can be said to have been a victim of Shanghai's wicked environment. As for his acquaintance with Ms. Hui, it was through an introduction at a banquet. Later, on the girl's birthday, he came to the east to invite her out, and their relationship became closer and closer. They often drove together to Hongqiao on weekends. However, Wang's father did not approve of Zhang, and Zhang, being extremely competitive, was determined to win Wang over. He signed divorce papers with his wife, but was arrested three days later. Zhang's last words were: "Life is like a dream, and my dream was too short." Yesterday, Zhang's wife said: "My dream is too bitter and desolate." After she published the notice addressed to Ms. Dang, she only received a phone call from someone related to both parties, who disapproved of her actions and thought they were intended to incite jealousy. She vehemently denied this intention yesterday. Her residence was originally the property of the traitor Zhou Bangjun and is now being reclaimed by the authorities. She will find another house to move to and plans to find a job to support Zhang's mother and sister. Yesterday, a reporter also visited Ms. Wang, but was unable to meet her. Her father, Wang Zhunchen, spoke instead, saying that his daughter was only eighteen years old and a "child" who did not understand love at all. Because she has always had a talent and love for music, she often performs on stage as a guest, so she has more contact with the outside world, but her relationship with Zhang Yamin was only ordinary friendship, and the various rumors are not worth taking seriously. She has decided to ignore Zhang's wife's advertisement.

[Another report] While Zhang was in prison, he wrote many poems on draft paper. His wife showed them to me yesterday. Here are some of them: "In the lonely and sorrowful prison, I only suffer from homesickness. Gazing at the white clouds, I dream and weep on my lonely pillow." "A brave man enters prison, fearing the sunrise in the morning. So many sad things happen that my soul is startled at night." "Qu Yuan threw himself into the river, General Yue Fei died on trumped-up charges. Loyal ministers only have the will to serve the country, brave men regret having no heart to kill traitors." "I want to send my sorrows on a jade letter, but alas, the green crow warns me back. It seems that tonight is the most sorrowful, all my thoughts are for the full moon." "Meritorious achievements are no longer in my mind, I only hope for prison food day and night. With a seven-foot body to support my family and serve the country, I will return to the mountains to cut firewood with the woodcutters in the spring."

### Hua Xing Shen Zhuang Exchange Rate Arbitrage Case: Xu and His Son Prosecuted

[Report from this newspaper] Xu Ke, manager of Hua Xing Shen Zhuang, was accused of private foreign exchange arbitrage. The Special Criminal Court has recently filed a public prosecution in the case. Xu is from Fujian, 52 years old. According to the indictment, Xu and his son Xu Bochao (the person in charge of Hua Xing Shen Zhuang's Hong Kong office) are engaged in the business of transporting books, stationery, cotton fabrics, etc., and selling them in Siam, Hong Kong, and various parts of Southeast Asia. They usually do not handle the foreign exchange earned through their business in accordance with the statutory procedures managed by the Central Bank, but instead privately hand it over to Hong Kong to operate in the black market for foreign exchange, which is remitted through the Dao Heng and Guang An Banks. Xu also bought and sold black market gold at Xu Bochao's request in December of last year, profiting from it. On August 23 of this year, Xu Bochao again purchased black market Hong Kong currency worth 5 billion legal tender and remitted it to Shanghai. On August 29 of the same year, he sent a receipt for payment from Huatong Company, informing Xu and the store's accountant, Hu Defu, to receive it. After someone reported it to the office of the supervisory inspector, the Garrison Headquarters sent personnel to investigate and seize seven gold ingots weighing seven taels and seven qian. Xu was arrested and, after being transferred to the Special Criminal Court for investigation, was prosecuted according to law. His son Xu Bochao is at large and is also being prosecuted.

### Land Administration Bureau Technician Sued for Transferring Rental Property Under False Pretenses

[Report from this newspaper] Yu Guangzu, a technician at the Municipal Land Administration Bureau from Nantong, falsely claimed in March of this year that he was transferring his rental property at 138 Zhaofeng Villa and asked Si Zhongshi, a tenant downstairs, to introduce him to a buyer. On June 22 of the same year, Si introduced Chen Daoyi, an agent for the Free Forum newspaper in this city, who agreed to the transfer. The two parties agreed on a transfer fee of 5.338 billion yuan, with half to be paid in advance, and five keys to the house were handed over to Si to be passed on. The remaining payment was to be paid after the house was cleared out. Unexpectedly, Yu suddenly asked Si to return the keys. Si refused because he was the intermediary and did not want to break his promise. Yu then took the same keys he had in reserve, opened the door, and had his relatives move in, denying that he had transferred the property. Chen believed that Yu's actions were suspected of fraudulently obtaining the transfer fee and filed a complaint with the District Attorney's Office. After investigation, the office has now filed a public prosecution against Yu on charges of fraud.

### Increased Tax on Goods Allowed to Increase in Price; Rising Prices in Outlying Areas; Effective Action Immediately Taken to Suppress Prices

[Report from this newspaper] The second meeting of the Shanghai District Price Review Committee was held yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. Those present included Jiang Jingguo, Mayor Wu, Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian, Li Lixia, Lin Chongyong, Xu Jiguang, Zhao Zengjue, Wu Yun Chu, Shui Xiangyun, and others, chaired by Yu Hongjun. First, the heads of the various competent authorities reported on the situation of price control. Subsequently, several important cases were passed. Regarding the question of whether the prices in this city should be appropriately adjusted, it was resolved that, in addition to the various goods on which the Ministry of Finance recently decided to increase taxes, which may be adjusted by adding the amount of the new tax to the selling price compared to the tax amount in August in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, the remaining various daily necessities should still comply with the price limits, strictly control them, and strictly prohibit price increases. The committee also paid special attention to the rising prices in the outlying areas of Shanghai and decided that the supervisory office should immediately take effective action to suppress them.

Types of Goods with Increased Taxes

[Another report] The goods with adjusted commodity taxes are limited to cigarettes, cigars, smoking tobacco, native tobacco, native tobacco silk, foreign wine, beer, native wine, tin foil, and superstitious paper. The originally planned tax increases on matches, sugar, cotton yarn, cement, and fur have now been decided not to be implemented. All the goods with increased taxes are not daily necessities, so the tax increase will not affect the prices of daily necessities.

### Land Produce Dealers Manipulating Vegetables; Supply in Urban Areas Abnormal; Wholesale Prices Including Basket Weight for Many Varieties Exceeding Price Limits

[Report from this newspaper] A reporter recently spent several days visiting rural villages and markets in the suburbs of Shanghai, including Wusong, Jiangwan, Pudong, Zhenru, Longhua, Fahua, Xujiahui, and other places, and found that the abnormality in the supply of vegetables in the urban area recently is not due to a decrease in the production of vegetables in the surrounding areas, but is due to the fact that there are countless "land produce dealers" (commonly known as vegetable shops) in the suburbs, acting as intermediaries between producers and consumers, who have not been able to comply with the laws and regulations, causing the urban area's vegetable market to be chaotic, price limits cannot be maintained, and supply relations cannot be normalized.

The area of land planted with vegetables around the suburbs of Shanghai is estimated to be at least 30,000 mu. The vegetables grown, including various crops, are uninterrupted from spring to winter. In addition, farmers value land and often adopt intensive planting methods, such as planting onions under the loofah vine trellis, and planting chives in the gaps between potato fields. In terms of the output obtained from this kind of cultivation, it should not be lacking to supply the non-staple food for a population of 5 million. Currently, anyone can drive to the suburbs to inspect. In places farther from the highway, the vegetable fields are endless, with edamame, spinach, onions, and chive sprouts fluttering in the wind, plump and lovely.

Controlling the Real Power of Adjustment

These vegetables must go through two stages from the farmer to the consumer: first, the "land produce dealers" purchase from the farmers every day, and then the vegetable vendors wholesale from them and transport them to the urban area to resell to vegetable stalls. Generally speaking, the "land produce dealers" have a closer relationship with the producers, and the vegetable vendors have a deeper relationship with the consumers, but the "land produce dealers" still control the real power to adjust the quantity and the price. A "land produce dealer" is scattered in every town and village in the suburbs. Larger towns have more than 30 of them. Their organization is extremely simple, with only a mat shed, a table, a scale, and three or four employees. The vegetable vendors are mostly refugees from other provinces who have fled to Shanghai. There are currently more than 10,000 people engaged in this profession in the city. Most of them rely on carrying vegetables on their shoulders and walking from the suburbs to the city.

Wholesaling at Double the Price

After the "land produce dealers" obtain vegetables from the farmers at low prices every day, they often wholesale them to the vegetable vendors at double the price, plus commission. They not only do not sell at the regulated wholesale price, but also try to include the weight of the basket when weighing the vegetables, so the actual wholesale price of various vegetables is equal to or higher than the price limits in the urban area. In order to seek appropriate profits, vegetable vendors cannot but increase the selling price. When stall vendors then supply them to the black market at even higher prices, they conceal and evade each other. Vegetables sold at the price limits are, of course, nowhere to be found in the market, and it is even more impossible to talk about a normal supply relationship. According to the vegetable vendors, although they know that selling vegetables above the price limits in the urban area is illegal, they should not be held responsible.

Wholesale Prices of Main Vegetables

According to the reporter's investigation in various places, the actual wholesale price of major vegetables per catty in the suburbs (including commission and basket weight) is roughly as follows:

Should Be Strengthened Control

The only place in the suburbs with a relatively better situation is the Pudong district, where the "land produce dealers" are supervised from time to time by plainclothes control personnel, so the wholesale prices are more ideal, and bad habits such as including the weight of the basket are also rare. For example, edamame is wholesaled at only 5.5 cents per catty, and hairy vegetables are also wholesaled at only 5 cents. These vegetables can be sold in the market without exceeding the price limits. However, due to the inconvenience of water and land transportation and the exorbitant freight costs, vegetable vendors mostly choose to wholesale from places such as Zhenru and Jiangwan. As a result, vegetables sold at the price limits have become constantly absent from the vegetable markets in the urban area.

Currently, if we want to get to the root of the problem and restore the normal supply of vegetables, so that every stall vendor can abide by the price limits, it seems necessary to strengthen control over the nearly 1,000 "land produce dealers" in the suburbs and lower the wholesale prices.

The Dachang Police Sub-bureau immediately sent police officers to investigate after receiving the report and reported it to the Municipal Police Bureau, which sent the photography division to take photos in the countryside. The name of the deceased and the cause of death are currently being thoroughly investigated by the Dachang Sub-bureau.

### Automobile Gasoline Conservation; Detailed Rules Amended and Approved; Regulations on Reduction Standards; Detailed Tables Listed; Objections May Be Reconsidered with Explanation

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Automobile Gasoline Conservation Method, after the Conservation Review Committee submitted three plans to the Executive Yuan for review, and then formulated interim measures in accordance with the third plan, will be implemented on October 1.

### Truck Hit by Train West of Zhenru Station; Driver and Escort Both Killed

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday morning at around 9 a.m., a train and a truck collided in Zhenru, a suburb of the city. The truck driver and escort were both killed. The truck was destroyed.

### Implement Economic Controls; Stabilize People's Livelihoods; Chiang Ching-kuo's Letter to a Friend

[This Newspaper's Report] Chiang Ching-kuo recently sent a letter to his friend Liu Hanqing, the Director of Finance of Guizhou Province, reviewing the results of economic management in Shanghai and again strongly emphasizing his determination to crack down on speculators. The full text is as follows:

Mr. Hanqing: Your letter has been received long ago. I have been busy lately, so I am only writing back today. Please forgive me. Since the victory, for the past three years, all the people in the country have hoped to live a stable life and for the country and society to move onto a normal path. To achieve this goal, we must not only overcome all political and military difficulties, but also make the same efforts in the economic field, in order to eliminate the speculation, hoarding, and all abnormal economic behavior that cause economic chaos. Therefore, on August 19, the government resolutely implemented the decision of economic controls and currency reform. This is a correct policy to save the country and the people.

Protect Legitimate Businesses; Eliminate All Excessive Profits

I was ordered to come to Shanghai to assist Mr. Yu Hongjun in supervising currency reform and economic controls. The responsibility is heavy. Its success or failure is related to the survival of the entire country and nation. Therefore, in order to accomplish the task, I have to adopt a strict and resolute attitude. Therefore, no matter who violates government laws and regulations, they will be severely punished according to law. Any illegal behavior will be cracked down on. What we are cracking down on is not the legitimate profits of industry and commerce, but excessive profits. What we oppose are those speculators and their behavior who make fortunes from national crises. We have repeatedly stated that we absolutely protect private property and legitimate industry and commerce. Only policies that seek the interests of the people can win the support of the people. Taking the interests of the majority of the people as our own interests and protecting legitimate industry and commerce are two sides of the same coin, inseparable from each other. In the past forty-two days of work, we are very grateful to the people of Shanghai for giving us a lot of help and encouragement. Therefore, we were able to achieve initial success.

Foreign Exchange-Related Commodities; Will Be Adjusted Reasonably

I can assure you that the speculative market in Shanghai has been eliminated, and bank deposits have increased dozens of times compared to before the currency reform. Bank interest rates have been reduced to four or five points. This is only the first step towards a normal economic life. What I mean by a normal economic life is normal transactions, open buying and selling, so that industry and commerce can obtain legitimate profits, and the people will not suffer from high prices and can live a stable life. The work of the past forty-odd days can only be said to have laid a preliminary foundation for a stable economic life. We do not believe that the power of the police can solve economic problems, but no one can deny that in the current situation, political power is one of the main conditions for solving economic chaos. The methods are nothing more than: strictly implementing controls on the one hand, and planning how to stabilize Shanghai's economy on the other. What everyone is concerned about now is industrial raw materials. According to reliable surveys, most raw materials, except for a few, can last for at least three months. Regarding the supply of raw materials, the government has decided that industry associations and government agencies will jointly purchase them from various places. As for raw materials purchased abroad with self-provided foreign exchange, it has also been decided to open them up. After August 19, the exchange rate has been increased, so the selling price of imported goods has also increased accordingly. We have considered that we will make reasonable adjustments to commodities related to foreign exchange, so that raw materials can be supplied continuously without fear of shortage.

Shanghai Prices Are Lower; Determined to Bring Other Places Up to Par

Now, the prices in Shanghai are lower compared to other places, so distributors from all over are flocking to Shanghai to purchase goods. The reason why this phenomenon occurs is that controls in other places are not strict, and some goods in Shanghai have been frozen and cannot flow smoothly. Regarding this issue, the government has decided to implement comprehensive controls, and will place the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the city of Nanjing under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Supervision Zone. In the future, we will decide to bring the prices in other places up to par with Shanghai. Shanghai is the industrial center of our country, with a large output. If it is not allowed to export, it will inevitably affect the entire production. Therefore, we have decided to carry out planned sales in order to ensure the smooth flow of goods.

Guide Floating Capital into Production; Bring Life Back on Track

Floating capital has become a serious problem in Shanghai. If it is not properly channeled, it will inevitably lead to speculation and hoarding. At present, in addition to selling surplus materials, state-owned enterprise stocks, short-term treasury bills, and enemy and puppet assets to absorb floating capital, the most important thing is how to guide it into productive enterprises. In order to achieve this goal, the first thing is to stabilize prices. At present, there are still two incorrect concepts: First, some people in the business community have been accustomed to using speculation and high prices to get rich in recent years, instead of being satisfied with obtaining legitimate profits, thinking that they cannot survive without engaging in national accumulation or rising prices. This improper concept must be eliminated. We hope that people engaged in industry and commerce will be law-abiding, strive for economic stability, and seek legitimate profits. Second, the rich people in Shanghai have always been accustomed to a comfortable life. One day, if they cannot buy meat, chicken, or eggs, or wool or yarn, they think it is terrible. We must know that we are currently in a difficult period and must bring economic life back on track so that the market can be stable. In this way, we can live a stable life. We will never retreat or even abandon the established control policies because of the current shortage of certain commodities.

Endure Temporary Pain; Solve All Kinds of Difficulties

In the past month, we have received so many threats, forcing us to compromise on price limits. Meat merchants have requested price increases eight times, but we would rather not buy meat than let them raise prices. In addition, there are some small factories that have suspended production due to lack of raw materials. We are working on a way to solve the raw material problem for them in the near future so that they can resume production. We are not afraid of difficulties, but if there are difficulties, we will always try our best to overcome them and never waver in the established decisions. Similar situations may occur in the near future, and are inevitable. In order to accomplish the task of economic control, we must endure temporary pain, but temporary pain is always much lighter than enduring long-term inflation. We hope that the citizens of Shanghai can share the difficulties and overcome the current difficulties, and maintain the basis of price stability that we have already achieved, and not be destroyed by unscrupulous merchants. Otherwise, Shanghai will once again become the world of speculators and hoarders, and at that time, all the citizens of Shanghai will once again fall into the terror of life.

Absolutely Maintain Price Limits; Intensify the Crackdown on Unscrupulous Merchants

In October, the government decided to allocate food rice to citizens, and public affairs vegetables will still be supplied to citizens at the September prices. Other prices will also not be changed. In short, except for a few commodities related to foreign exchange and tax increases that will be reasonably adjusted, all other commodities will maintain the "August 19" price limits, and even those that are too high will be suppressed, so that the entire industry and commerce can move towards normalization, but no one will be allowed to take the opportunity to raise prices and disrupt the market. Cracking down on unscrupulous merchants is one of the targets of our work and will never be relaxed. There are mutual rights and obligations between the government and the people. The obligation of the people to the government is to strengthen the power of the government. The government also has the responsibility to ensure the livelihood of the people. The difficulties of the government should be announced to the people, and the pain of the people should also be brought to the government. Everyone should recognize that today's situation is extremely difficult, but we should have a calm attitude and courage to overcome it, so that we can obtain a stable life. Wishing you good health! Chiang Ching-kuo.

### Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway: Western Section Terminus; Zhuzhou on the Edge of Hunan Province

— Our Reporter Liu Zao

[Report from Nanchang, 25th] Zhuzhou, the terminus of the western section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, now bears the brunt of the transportation hub between Southeast and Southwest China. Tianxin, five kilometers north of the Zhuzhou Station on the Guangdong-Han Railway, will be the joint station of the Guangdong-Han, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and the Xiang-Qian Railway, which is waiting to be built.

The minerals, especially coal and iron, stored in Hunan Province are important raw materials for heavy industry in the future, and Zhuzhou is the center of convenient transportation. Therefore, many heavy industries, such as agricultural chemical plants, ×× ordnance factories, etc., are moving to Zhuzhou to build factories.

The central government has already decided on part of the construction plan for the new Zhuzhou, such as the preparation and construction of the Tianxin Joint Station, which is a transportation sector in the entire construction plan. The future of Zhuzhou is bright and great.

The current stage of Zhuzhou is still wearing the cloak of a town. The first time I stepped into the edge of Hunan, Zhuzhou, I saw the large plates of betel nuts that Hunan people like to eat, which made me recall the tragic scene when General Xue Boliang passed through Zhuzhou during the three victories in Changsha. Now it has returned to its pre-war state. There are banks, transportation companies, and endless trains and sailboats here.

This time, I returned from Zhuzhou and got off the train in Pingxiang in the middle of the night. The night in Pingxiang is a journey that I will never forget. There is a hotel called "Ping Zong" in the city, but because it was late at night and quiet, I couldn't find it anywhere. I had to find "Jiaotong" on the wet and dirty street leading into the city to stay. This small inn had gambling, prostitution, and countless bugs and mosquitoes. I went to bed and resisted the "evil forces," looking forward to dawn. Unexpectedly, around two o'clock, a strong man of unknown identity rushed into the door and grabbed me fiercely, asking, "What are you doing? Why are you staying in my room?"... At that time, I was also inexplicably why this happened. Later, an old woman came to explain that he had originally booked this room for accommodation because he was drunk and asked me to forgive him.

I inquired about who this fierce man was, and then I learned that he was a "wounded soldier" from the Veterans Hospital. It was really "a scholar meeting a soldier, there is no reasoning to be done." I had to let him scold me.

Yichun preserved eggs are a specialty of the western section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. In the past, they were cheap and of good quality. When we went to Zhuzhou, we heard that they sold for 50,000 yuan each. This time, when we came back, we specially inquired in Zhuzhou, preparing to buy some to nourish the children, but unexpectedly, in the three days that had passed, the price had increased by more than double, and the asking price was 120,000, and the egg shop was unwilling to sell much. Ham was also regarded as a precious guest and could not be bought. It is said that from Zhuzhou to Xinyu, before the issuance of gold coupons, the silver dollars here were only 4 million each, but now they have risen to 6 million. All prices have been raised by three points in "compliance with the law." Up to now, I have not seen a single price control announcement from the county government. Most of the rice and other transactions in various places still use silver dollars. The gold coupons have a good influence on the people, but the local banks have not yet started to exchange them.

A piece of armed fighting battlefield. The weapons held by the people include rifles, pistols, grenades, and mortars and artillery. During armed fighting, both sides plant flags and form formations, and build field fortifications, as if facing a great enemy. Last year, the armed fighting in Fenyi lasted for three or four months, and the number of people participating in the battle involved four or five counties. I won't talk about the votes. Sometimes, the county magistrate came forward to stop it, and they would entertain him very politely, but they would also temporarily borrow the county magistrate's currency to suppress the weapons of the artillery, fight a fierce battle, and then return the original items. The wage for ordinary people to go to the Currency Martial Arts to participate in one side of the battle is five yuan in silver, and half price without a gun—two yuan and five cents.

The transportation from Suzhou to Nanchang can also be said to be the full line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, because all the signs for the Zhangshu Bridge are still in Canada, and the departure has been postponed again and again, so it affects the transportation of the entire line. The Railway Bureau originally planned to build a wooden pontoon bridge before the difficult problem of the Zhangshu Bridge was resolved, but the Ministry of Communications believed that the steel beams could be shipped in June, so it rejected the request. Later, the Railway Bureau saw that the solution to the problem was not easy, so it used ferries to transport the urgently needed machines and cars from the western section to the other side of the river upstream of the bridge, and set up a station in Menlouli. In the future, passenger transport is prepared to exchange rides with the military in Menlouli and the east bank of Zhangshu, using ferries to transport passengers across the river, but freight cars are transported by barges. This time-consuming and laborious method takes two to two hours each time it crosses the river, even if the wind is calm and the waves are calm. If there is a flood, it will probably take more time. Facing this difficulty, the Railway Bureau has now decided to build a pontoon bridge downstream of the Zhangshu Bridge. The inspection team that went west this time also went to Zhangshu to survey, and Yan Tiesheng, deputy chief engineer, was left in Zhangshu to find a solution. It is reported that the location of the pontoon bridge has been determined to be downstream of the Gan River, with a total length of 800 meters, and about 5 kilometers of earthwork will need to be added, and another track will be laid. The total project cost is estimated to be around 20 billion yuan, and it can be completed in three months. However, they are still looking forward to the arrival of the steel beams, otherwise, the pontoon bridge will have problems after the river rises next spring, so the smooth flow of the entire Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway will have to wait for two or three months.

### Several Problems in the Nanzhou Section Still Need to Be Resolved

The difficult problems after the opening of the Nanzhou section still need to be solved. The following are just a few things that the reporter saw and heard along the line this time.

The steel goods problem. The salvage work of the Zhangshu Bridge and the branches of the Gan River has been completed 50%, and the construction of the bridge piers has also been completed, waiting for the Canadian steel beams to be put on the shelves. However, it has been heard for half a year that this batch of steel goods will soon be shipped from Canada, so at that time, the Railway Bureau planned to build a pontoon bridge in Zhangshu in preparation for opening to traffic. The Ministry of Communications trusted that the steel beams could be delivered on schedule and rejected the Railway Bureau's plan. Then, it started to set up a ferry in Zhangshu to send carriages across the river, so now the line on the west bank of Jiangxi has been changed to Menlouli, and the urgently needed nail road materials and some carriages are transported by ferry. However, the facts tell them that each ferry takes one and a half hours from the east bank to Menlouli, plus getting on the boat on the east bank and climbing the slope on the west bank, it also takes two hours even if the wind is calm and the waves are calm. In the future, the freight transport, under the current circumstances, must move the entire carriage from this bank to the other. Although passenger transport has prepared two trains to meet each other on both banks, passengers will not be able to bear it when they encounter a cold winter and snow, or a sunny day. Not only will the passengers not sympathize with the Railway Bureau's difficulties, but also the order during the crossing will probably become a big problem. Moreover, when military transport is busy, it will be even more difficult for the employees at the station to cope with.

Friends from the eastern section of "Zhejiang" all say that the "red hats" on this road are very well-organized in serving passengers. However, from Yingtan West, in Nanchang's Niuhang, Jiujiang, Pingxiang, and even Zhuzhou, the Railway Bureau cannot manage them because of the local labor. For example: the evil forces can arbitrarily collect loading and unloading fees from passengers. Nanchang Niuhang and Jiujiang are controlled by the local people. In the past, the loading fee for a car in Xiaogang Port was only more than 30 million according to the regulations of the Railway Bureau, but the local porters demanded 300 million. The same incident also occurred in Zhuzhou. The loading and unloading work is directly related to the passengers. If they do not understand the inside story, they will of course complain about the Railway Bureau's mismanagement, but the fact is that there are internal difficulties.

The impact of armed fighting

The old people in the section from Xinyi west to Yichun east of the Nanzhou section are known for their armed fighting. The weapons stored in the countryside include not only long guns and short guns, but also mortars and artillery. During their armed fighting, the wages of the fighters are five yuan in silver for those with guns and two yuan and five cents in silver for those without guns. If they are killed in battle, there is also a generous resettlement fee. The abundant local weapons affect the local security, and armed fighting and even robbery often occur. Now, the theft of railway materials is constantly happening in Zhangshu, and the theft of road nails and fish scale plates is also happening in Xinyi from time to time. These incidents may directly or indirectly affect the future driving.

The Railway Bureau is now trying to solve some of the above-mentioned difficulties, and at the same time, they hope that the local people will give them sympathetic assistance.

### Restricting the Import and Export of Gold Coupons; Hong Kong Begins Strict Enforcement

Over-limit Funds Will Be Confiscated

[Our Newspaper Hong Kong 30th Telegram] Since the currency change, the regulations on the import and export of gold coupons stipulate a limit of twenty yuan. Starting from the 22nd of this month, the anti-smuggling office of the Hong Kong Customs and the police officers at the pier and station have begun to carry out strict inspections. On the morning of the 28th, two passengers who violated the regulations by carrying gold coupons exceeding the import and export limit were seized at Kai Tak Airport and sentenced in the Kowloon Court. (1) Zhang Gongrui, a 38-year-old Shanghai businessman, came to Hong Kong on a China Airlines flight from Shanghai. When he arrived at Kai Tak Airport, anti-smuggling officers found 160 yuan of gold coupons in the defendant's luggage. After the trial, it was ordered that the excess of 160 yuan of gold coupons be confiscated. (2) Huang Peisi, a 48-year-old comprador of the Taikoo Shipping Company, was searched by anti-smuggling officer No. 362 at 11:00 a.m. on the 27th before leaving Hong Kong on a Hong Kong Airlines flight, and 287.60 yuan of gold coupons were found on him. The court ruled that the guarantee of 50 yuan in cash and the gold coupons found were confiscated.

### The City of Kweiting in Kweichow Flourishes from American Tobacco, Heading Towards Normal Development

— By Our Reporter, Liu Meng-Chi

[Dispatch from Kweiyang, 27th of this month] Kweiting, Kweichow Province's American tobacco, now as famous as Nanyang's Nangcheng Xuchang in Henan and Jianyang Ziyang in Sichuan, has long been valued by tobacco businesses. Since the advocacy of former provincial chairman Yang Sen and the current emphasis on increased production by Gu Zhenglun, this once impoverished and obscure small county has seen the establishment of numerous national banks, bureaus, and commercial firms. The people are well-fed and clothed, and their living standards have improved. This has not only influenced other counties in the province to try planting, but has also attracted American tobacco industry professionals to come to Kweichow for observation and learning, causing a widespread sensation. Consequently, the local cigarette industry has been rapidly developing, and the national tax revenue has also greatly increased. All levels of government and the people place the greatest hope on American tobacco production. Therefore, before the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), Kweichow's specialty was Huangcaoba's opium, but after the 30th year, Kweiting's American tobacco has become the most outstanding. According to Fang Zhaoheng, manager of the Kweichow Tobacco Company, the production statistics for the 36th year of the Republic (1947) show that the total harvest in the province was about 80,000 "dan" (a unit of weight), and Kweiting alone accounted for more than 60,000 "dan." With the current market price of over 200 million yuan in legal tender for every 100 "jin" (another unit of weight) of top-quality yellow leaves, the total figure is astonishing! As a reporter who visited Kweiting at the beginning of summer this year when American tobacco was being planted, I know that the county is indeed a small city with an area of only 1,909.60 square kilometers, or 7,638.40 square "shi li" (a traditional Chinese unit of distance). It has 2,864.40 "shi mu" (a traditional Chinese unit of area) of arable land, and a current population of 105,405 people, averaging about 54 people per square kilometer. However, due to the suitable climate and moderate rainfall, it is extremely suitable for agricultural production. The Xiang-Qian and Qian-Gui highways both run through the county, and military transports often use the county seat as a stopover. The Duzhu section of the Xiang-Gui-Qian railway, which is under construction, also passes through the county along the Qian-Gui highway from west to east. The future railway station will be located at Taohuaping, north of the city. Various major towns in the county and neighboring counties are connected by highways, which is quite convenient for tobacco farmers and merchants to travel and for the collection and distribution of tobacco leaves. The streets in the city are flat, and factories and stores are everywhere. There are opera houses and cinemas. The clothing of the people is generally more fashionable than in the provincial capital, Guiyang. They are particularly fond of gambling and prostitution. Large denomination banknotes circulate in the market earlier than in Guiyang, mostly brought by national banks or tobacco merchants from Beijing and Shanghai. Therefore, the cost of living is particularly high. Those who pass through the area cannot help but recognize this as an abnormally developed rural prosperity.

Since the mid-Qing Dynasty, the county has been known for producing leaf tobacco, which is sold throughout the province and parts of Hunan, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan. The raw material used is the locally produced "zhe" tobacco, which is milder in taste than other tobacco leaves in the province and "jintangshi" tobacco in Sichuan. Its seeds came from Fujian Province, and the production area spans about two to three hundred "li" (another traditional Chinese unit of distance). As for American tobacco, it was brought from the United States in the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940) by Peng Hu, the general manager of the Guizhou Enterprise Company. The Guizhou Tobacco Company and the Guizhou Agricultural Improvement Institute established a cooperative method for promoting American tobacco. The Agricultural Improvement Institute sent personnel to provide guidance, and agreed to distribute seeds to farmers who had previously planted "zhe" tobacco, teaching them methods of sowing, seedling cultivation, transplanting, and fertilization, and encouraging them to plant. However, the planting suffered a setback due to hail that year, resulting in very little production. But the tobacco leaves obtained were tested by the company and found to be excellent in color and aroma, quite different from other products of the same kind. Tobacco farmers also felt that planting American tobacco on the same amount of land yielded more than planting "zhe" tobacco. The Tobacco Company, in order to encourage promotion, did not hesitate to purchase at high prices. As a result of the publicity, those who planted American tobacco emerged one after another. Since then, year after year, efforts have been made to improve it, and American tobacco in Kweiting has spread like wildfire, with a sharp increase in production. Today, the fields of the county are a sea of green, having become a world of American tobacco.

High-quality American tobacco leaves are characterized by being wide, uniform, and thin, with dense veins, no blisters or scars, a golden color, not oily or sticky, not dry, and a clear aroma. Although this is related to planting, fertilization, baking, and fermentation, the climate and soil still play an important role. Kweiting has mostly sandy loam soil and a mild climate, so it is suitable for planting American tobacco. However, the leaves produced are also divided into "inner mountain" and "outer mountain." "Inner mountain" refers to the tobacco produced in the hinterland of the county, around two hundred square kilometers, and its tobacco leaves are not significantly different from the original variety. The output of "outer mountain" is slightly inferior, but it is still superior to that produced in other counties. Those familiar with the tobacco business can tell it at a glance. There is an absolutely unmistakable difference between "inner mountain" and "outer mountain" tobacco leaves: at the point where the petiole separates from the stem, the leaves of "outer mountain" and outer counties always have a small number of stem skin and vein tendons, and the petiole ends are pointed after drying. The petiole ends of "inner mountain" tobacco leaves are neat at the cut, without reverse tendons, and the petiole ends swell and become round like "nails" after baking. This kind of "inner mountain" tobacco leaves, even in the Kweiting market, often fetch higher prices per hundred "jin" than other tobacco leaves, and tobacco factories mostly use it as raw material for high-end cigarettes. Tobacco farmers have accumulated eight or nine years of practical experience in planting, transplanting, and baking American tobacco. They not only have sufficient knowledge of tobacco leaf growth technology, but also know how to select the right climate and soil. Farmers pay special attention to the "baking" technique, but equipment is not easy to obtain, and controlling the heat is particularly difficult, but there are about 8,000 tobacco farmers with baking rooms in the county. Since the promotion of planting in the Kweiting American tobacco area by the Guizhou Tobacco Company in the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), production has increased sharply.

The cigarette industry has also emerged in response. In the beginning, apart from the Guizhou Tobacco Company, there were no large-scale organizations. Even those that existed were only civilians who had fled from the occupied areas or veterans recuperating from injuries, using wooden hand-cranked cigarette machines to retail cigarettes in the streets and alleys. Therefore, the American tobacco produced in Kweiting in the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941) was still purchased by the Guizhou Tobacco Company at high prices. In the 31st, 32nd, and 33rd years (1942-1944), the number of tobacco farmers increased sharply, and production increased. Between the 34th, 35th, and 36th years (1945-1947), the government spared no effort in guiding the improvement of quality and baking technology, and at the same time provided as much assistance as possible to tobacco farmers, organizing cooperative loans. As a result, production became even more abundant. Baking rooms were built, and nurseries were established on their own. Within the county seat, the Jiuda Cigarette Factory and others were established one after another, and at the same time, they were sold to the provinces of Hunan, Guangxi, and Sichuan. Later, the Guilin No. 1 Middle School Cigarette Factory and the Guilin Cigarette Cooperative moved to Kweiting and established factories in Guiyang to manufacture various brands of cigarettes in large quantities. At that time, because Hong Kong, Guangzhou Bay, and the滇缅路 (Burma Road) were blocked and foreign goods could not be imported, factories evolved together, and the quality and packaging were greatly improved, so hand-rolled cigarettes were gradually eliminated. Around the time of the victory of the War of Resistance, the cigarette factories in Kweiting and Guiyang strengthened their efforts to seize the market in other provinces, and greatly increased the production and sales to Sichuan, Yunnan, and the southwestern and northwestern provinces. For example, the Golden Eagle and Penguin cigarettes produced by the Guizhou Tobacco Company were once transported from Kunming to India and Burma, and were welcomed everywhere for their excellent quality and low price. Because of this, those who engaged in the American tobacco business in major cities in the country gathered in Kweiting. At present, in addition to tobacco merchants from Hong Kong, Shanghai, Ningbo, Wuhan, Guilin, Liuzhou, Changsha, Hengyang, and Chongqing who have established large-scale firms in the county seat, Kweiting tobacco merchants have also established firms and warehouses in Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changsha, Hunan, and Chongqing. Each year, about 5,000 vehicles of tobacco leaves are packaged and transported from here. There are also large cigarette factories in the city such as China, Jincheng, Yiji, Xiangnan, Times, Decheng, Qihua, Jingsheng, Qianghua, Samsung, and Juhua Xiang, which produce excellent and abundant products, with inventories piled up like mountains. It is no exaggeration to call it "the city of cigarettes."

However, American tobacco leaves are prone to deterioration during sowing and transplantation, and tobacco farmers in Kweiting are eager for immediate gains and do not know how to preserve the original variety unchanged, which is like killing the hen to get the eggs. At the time of sowing in early summer this year, continuous rain affected the seedbeds, and less than half of the seedlings survived. After the Dragon Boat Festival, when the tobacco seedlings were growing, they were destroyed by wind and rain, and the survivors were short and had sparse leaves. According to the observations and estimates of experienced people, if the weather does not continue to clear up, this year's American tobacco in Kweiting and nearby counties can be expected to yield 300 "jin" for every 10,000 plants, and it may be difficult to bake. Measuring the annual losses of tobacco farmers by this income, the golden leaf dream this year may not be as good as in previous years. In view of this, the provincial government recently ordered the provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute to select agricultural personnel with experience in American tobacco planting from the tobacco-producing counties to come to Guiyang for study. After graduating from the six-month American Tobacco Baking Technology Training Class, it recently held a one-year American Tobacco Planting Technology Training Class. At the same time, it instructed the Guizhou Tobacco Company to quickly organize demonstration work such as grading, packaging, and baking, so that this emerging rural sideline industry can follow a normal development path. Regarding the export of American tobacco, the province has found that in recent years, tobacco farmers have been ignorant and do not know how to cherish their reputation, often using "outer mountain" tobacco to impersonate "inner mountain" tobacco, or adding soil, river sand, residual stems, and rotten leaves, causing buyers to be disgusted. As a result, the Kweiting American tobacco, which was just being valued, has been rejected by the market. The provincial government has also recently decided to add a permanent inspection agency to regularly handle inspection, grading, and testing matters, in order to ensure that the production meets market needs, strictly prevent fraud, and improve quality. The US government has strictly prohibited the export of American tobacco seeds. How to preserve the original variety and improve the quality in the future still requires special attention from our country's agricultural research institutions.

### Abundant Coal Deposits Along the Chekiang-Kiangsi Railway Line: A Brief Statistical Report

[Dispatch from Nanchang, 26th of this month] At present, domestic sources of heavy coal, such as Anshan, Benxi, Beipiao, Fushun in the Northeast, as well as Kailuan, Jingxing in Hebei, Jiaozuo in Henan, Jiawang in northern Jiangsu, and Zaozhuang in southern Shandong, have been severely damaged or forced to stop production. In the future, coal supply will rely on a small number of mines in Central and Southern China before the communist bandits are completely eliminated north of the Yellow River. It will be difficult to maintain the needs of the entire industry and the civil use of major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. Therefore, the center of coal production will inevitably shift to areas south of the Yangtze River in the future. The biggest task of the Chekiang-Kiangsi Railway is to supply coal, which is indeed a heavy responsibility. Therefore, in addition to the construction of the main line, there is also the construction of the Quangao and Guile branch lines, which are entirely for the purpose of transporting coal.

At present, according to the amount of coal deposits along the Chekiang-Kiangsi Railway that have been developed or have been recorded by drilling, there are quite rich treasures. For example, the Lanxi mining area in Chekiang Province has an area of 759.24 hectares and a storage capacity of about 100,000 tons. The Qu County mining area has an area of 1,385.7 hectares and a storage capacity of hundreds of thousands of tons. All were destroyed by the enemy during the War of Resistance, and there has been no power to recover them since the victory.

Those belonging to the territory of Kiangsi Province include the Pingxiang mining area, with a storage capacity of about 200,000,000 tons, the coal storage capacity of Leping and Poyang counties is 80,000,000 tons, and the coal storage capacity of Fengcheng is 60,000,000 tons. Other counties such as Shangrao, Yichun, Xinyu, and Jinxian also have bituminous coal deposits, but they are all mined by indigenous methods, and the output is extremely low.

### Sparse Crowds on the Market: Rice Market Enters Stagnation, Grain Transactions Decline, Oil Prices Rise Again

Rice market transactions are still stagnant. Market quotations remain the same, but no transactions are taking place. Although fellow traders still come to the market, they leave soon after due to the lack of transactions. The market is sparsely populated, and the closing time is quite early. Yesterday's registered arrivals were 710 "shi" in the south market, including 480 "shi" of inferior rice, and 973 "shi" in the north market. Transactions were almost zero.

Flour remains suspended and not open for business. Due to the small amount of wheat arriving, the mills are unable to supply the market due to the difficulty in obtaining raw materials. According to this situation, market transactions will be difficult to resume in the short term, but the distribution of flour by the mills will continue as usual.

Grain transactions have declined. There are very few transactions in various grains. About 200 bags of Poyang Zi soybeans were offered, and Taigai competed to buy them. Other transactions were scattered. More than 30 bags of Yuan wheat were offered, and some corn was also offered. Green beans and red beans were not offered. There were still many sesame transactions, and no raw peanuts were offered.

Edible oil transactions are still booming. Soybean oil has risen by another 45 cents, nearing the limit. The price is 51.9 yuan. Many units were offered by the factories, including Datong Factory and Zhongzhi Factory. Shencaiyou and other factories also offered some units. The price is 47.3 yuan, also approaching the limit price. Jilutong oil from Qilu Company was offered with hot rapeseed oil. Pure raw oil is stable, and small cart oil is still at the limit price. 400 pieces of Datong soybean cake were offered.

### Strong Overseas Demand: Bright Prospects for the Tea Market

[Our dispatch] This reporter recently visited the tea magnate Mr. Zhu Xijin. According to him, when shipments of export tea to Shanghai were continuous this year, it coincided with the time when the Chinese government revised the exchange control measures to encourage exports, thereby invigorating people's hearts and causing the market situation to improve daily. By August 19th, the authorities announced the currency reform and re-established the exchange rate, so export goods benefited even more and showed a vigorous atmosphere. Tea, in particular, due to the sharp decline in production and urgent overseas demand, those holding goods are optimistic. Their firm sales mentality is almost incomparable to the mood to sell two years ago, resulting in shining prices. However, transactions are formed by negotiation, and opening deals is inevitably narrow, but the future will surely be more dazzling. As for the domestic sales of red and green tea, this street and Suzhou-Wuxi and other places are still okay, but in the case of demand, they have been circling the original route.

### Grain Market Rises Again

Yesterday, rumors of the opening up of sugar again stimulated the market, and people's hearts were re-invigorated. Outside merchants frequently came to buy, and local merchants also rose up to add to their purchases. Prices were shouted up and the upward trend was very strong. After the opening of the 21st-term sandy white stock order, there were buyers but no sellers. Coarse and medium-sized sand were also firm and popular. The market for No. 45 car white refined sugar was still stable at the beginning of the market, but then popular grades rose together, and the price also rose in a straight line. Xinghua red sugar became weaker because the supply increased. Other grades rose by about one yuan.

### State-Owned Enterprise Stocks: Building Stocks Sold the Most

[Our dispatch] After the sale of state-owned enterprise stocks, as of October 1st, a total of 2,992,400 Gold Yuan were sold in various places, with Building Stocks selling the most and Tianjin Paper selling the least.

### Loan Interest Rates of Banks and Credit Institutions: Monthly Interest Rate Must Not Exceed 3%

[Our dispatch] After the currency reform, regarding the loan interest rates of various banks and credit institutions, the Joint Treasury stipulated that they should be calculated according to the new method from August 23rd, with the highest not exceeding a monthly interest rate of 3%.

However, it is learned that the various banks and credit institutions proposed to handle this in a flexible manner, and submitted a request to the 371st meeting of the Board of Directors of the Joint Treasury for approval. The reply was as follows: (1) The deposit and loan interest rates handled by state-owned banks and credit institutions should be handled in accordance with the Measures for the Restriction of Deposit and Loan Interest Rates of Banks promulgated by the Executive Yuan, and should be revised in accordance with the previously stipulated principles. Regardless of the newly written loan interest rate, interest should be calculated from August 23rd of this year, with the highest not exceeding a monthly interest rate of 3%. However, industrial and mining loans that were due before August 23rd but have not yet been repaid will be allowed to accrue overdue interest in accordance with banking practices.

(2) Deposit interest rates should be proposed by local banks and credit institutions in consultation within the scope stipulated by laws and regulations, and then reported to the office for record.

### Gold Yuan Certificates Are Temporarily Not Circulating in Taiwan Province

### Rubber Import Quotas: The Transportation Management Adjusts the Ratio

The Import Quota Allocation Office has adjusted the import quotas for rubber and its related categories starting from the sixth quarter. The quota for raw rubber has been increased, accounting for 68.5%, totaling USD 704,232. The quota for Guangdong skin has been reduced, accounting for 1.5%, totaling USD 15,421. The quota for tires accounts for 26.5%, totaling USD 72,440. The quota for other products accounts for 3%, totaling USD 30,824. In addition, in order to consider the adjustment and use of it, a type of user who cannot participate in the allocation of user quotas has been added for reserve purposes, accounting for 0.5%, totaling USD 5,140. Regarding the above allocation, the Transportation Management Committee has now obtained the opinion of the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, which believes that the tire quota should be limited to automobile and aircraft tires. Other tires can be self-supplied domestically and do not need to be imported. In the future, the tire quota can be fully allocated to import tire manufacturing parts in order to gradually reduce the import of tires.

### Cotton Yarn Trend Returns to Fatigue, Cloth Unanimously Booms and Rises to Limit

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw good trading at the morning open, with strong buying interest, and all yarns were bid up to the limit line. The popular 60-count "Flying Goddess" yarn was at 1,285 yuan, and 42-count "Golden Double Chicken" was at 1,060 yuan. Subsequently, rumors spread that state-owned and private yarn factories would stop allocating yarn to wholesale merchants, which immediately caused anxiety among the industry, and trading turned quiet, causing the market to return to fatigue.

The prices of various fine yarns, such as 42-count, 40-count, and 32-count, as well as 21-count "Double Horse" yarn, all hovered at the limit line. However, within the 21-count yarn market, supply was scarce and demand was high, so transactions were made at the limit price. The momentum of coarse yarns, such as 16-count and 10-count, was ordinary, and the market fluctuated in a soft range. The "Spinning and Construction Company" opened sales of a type of 20-count "Longevity" yarn at a price of 700 yuan, and applications were limited to clothing, knitwear, towels, bedding, handkerchiefs, canvas, and yarn merchants registered with numbers 301 to the end.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw strong buying interest and high morale. Although the Wing On Textile Factory opened allocations of "Dapeng" fine cloth, and the "Spinning and Construction Company" followed suit with allocations, the rising trend was difficult to curb. Sellers adopted a wait-and-see attitude.

Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth initially rose slightly by one corner, but then local shops competed to buy, and the price rose again by six corners. Some people bought in, and later the Chamber of Commerce directors and Wing On Textile Factory sold 2,640 bolts of fine cloth and "Four Gentlemen" gold-printed Yuan serge. The market closed in the afternoon at 28.40 yuan, a significant increase of 5 corners compared to the previous day.

"Dragon Head" D-type and "Five Blessings Trumpet" and other types of cloth all rose to the limit immediately after opening. Serge was in high demand at the time, and "Four Gentlemen" white-printed serge, "Golden Fortune Wonderful Dance Jumping Carp," and second-grade products were all traded. Because the "Spinning and Construction Company" allocated a considerable amount of cloth the previous day, only "Four Gentlemen" Yuan serge edged up by one corner, while the rest of the market remained stable. A total of 1,480 yuan worth of transactions were made throughout the day.

Furthermore, the Wing On Textile Factory allocated 2,000 bolts of 12-pound "Dapeng" fine cloth (20 bolts per package) in the cotton cloth market yesterday. The allocation price was 28 gold yuan per bolt. Applicants could stamp and prepare slips before 3 pm, indicating their membership number, and apply for allocation. The names of the approved applicants would be announced next Monday (the 4th). Those who received allocations were required to submit a bank draft endorsed by a director to the Cotton Cloth Association before 10 am the next day (the 5th) to exchange for a warehouse receipt.

[Our Newspaper News] The Cotton Textile Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai held the fourth phase of the third joint allocation of yarn from private yarn factories yesterday (the 2nd). A total of 1,025 bales of 20-count cotton yarn were allocated. Also, the total amount of yarn and cloth opened for sale by various factories on the 1st and 2nd of this month was equivalent to 995 bales of 20-count cotton yarn and 28,822 bolts of cotton cloth. It is understood that the current selling price of cotton in the production areas is lower than the cost, and how to maintain the production costs of yarn factories is a matter of great concern.

Cotton Market Allows Price Drops

Yesterday, no spot cotton transactions were made. The inventory in the industry is becoming increasingly thin, and the market has been sluggish for a long time. The price of rice in the suburbs of Shanghai has risen, and cotton farmers are unwilling to sell cheaply. Coarse and fine cotton have long been unavailable in Shanghai. It is now reported that even cottonseeds in Zhoupu are priced but unavailable.

### Cotton Textile Association Suggests a Comprehensive Joint Purchase of National Cotton

[Our Newspaper News] The Cotton Textile Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai held an interim meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon starting at 2 pm. As a result of the discussion, they passed a proposal to change the government's decided key joint purchase system for national cotton to a comprehensive joint purchase system. The key joint purchase system is limited to Shanghai and Hankou, which will cause market confusion in areas outside the joint purchase area. It would cause cotton in the joint purchase area to escape to the non-joint purchase areas, which is not a good policy. A comprehensive joint purchase system, in addition to Shanghai and Hankou, would include other important national cotton strongholds such as Nantong, Xi'an, Shashi, Ningbo, Pudong, and Taijia, so as to standardize the system. It is heard that this proposal is comprehensive and will be submitted to the National Yarn Factory Federation for approval before being recommended to the National Cotton Joint Purchase Association for adoption and implementation.

### Chinese Sociological Society Opens Its Ninth Annual Meeting; Gu Zhenggang and Pound Attend and Give Speeches

The quality of social administration reflects the level of civilization of a country.

### Scholarships Not Yet Fully Raised; Still Awaiting Allocation from Supervisor Jiang; Special Funds from the Sale of Confiscated Materials

[Our Newspaper News] According to Zheng Jie, the secretary-general of the Municipal Scholarship Unified Review Committee, the scholarships have raised more than 130,000 gold yuan so far. Deputy Director Xi Mou has personally visited various pledging organizations in recent days to solicit donations. Raising the full 150,000 yuan should not be a problem.

### Searching for "Peking Man"; Allied Headquarters and Japan Have Not Found Their Whereabouts; After the Pearl Harbor Incident, the Rare Skeletal Remains Mysteriously Disappeared

[Central News Agency Tokyo 2nd Dispatch] The skeletal remains of "Peking Man," one of the world's oldest human ancestors, discovered near Beiping in 1926, mysteriously disappeared in 1941 and may be lost to the world forever. In response to the recent request from the Chinese Mission in Japan for assistance in finding this paleontological marvel, the Allied Headquarters' Civil Property Management Office told the Chinese Mission that "based on the information currently available, no further investigation can be conducted." The Japanese Private Property Bureau stated that all efforts to find the whereabouts of this rare treasure have been ineffective. In 1941, due to the deteriorating Sino-Japanese relations, it was planned to transport "Peking Man" to the United States for preservation. The skeletal remains were packed in three boxes, labeled with the letters ABC, and were handed over to the US Marine Corps, which was about to withdraw from North China. However, on the same day, the Pearl Harbor incident broke out, and the U.S. Marines in North China were detained by the Japanese army in Qinhuangdao. Since then, "Peking Man" has disappeared. The Japanese Private Property Bureau stated that the investigation conducted by the Restoration Bureau showed that around December 1941, the Japanese army stationed in Qingdao was the 15th Brigade of the 27th Division. However, the names and current addresses of the personnel of this brigade could not be found. The relevant dates are no longer known in detail. The bureau continued that it is not yet known whether the brigade was related to the matter. It also said that the Restoration Bureau had inquired with the following people: Nakamura, Shimakanuki, and Tsukamoto, who had served as staff officers in the Japanese army in North China, but they were also unable to provide accurate information.

The Group A Small Ball League entered its second week yesterday.

Yiguang and Ji Zhu were evenly matched. The first half ended 0-0, without distinction. In the second half, Ji Zhu's Xu Heming scored the first goal. Yiguang counterattacked and Lin Shaojun equalized in just two minutes. The game ended in a melee, with each side scoring one goal. Next, Lihua played against Jingwu. The latter played unsatisfactorily and lost its normal state. In both halves, Lihua's Xu Zuguo scored one goal each, beating Jingwu by two goals. In the final game, Donghua and Central Aviation Red met. Central Aviation Red's offense was quite strong. Donghua's goalkeeper Han Longgen dived and jumped, saving many dangerous balls and giving a wonderful performance. In the second half, Central Aviation Red exhausted its energy, and Donghua switched from defense to offense. Fortunately, Central Aviation relied on goalkeeper Dong Jincai's effective defense and did not concede any goals. The game ended in a 0-0 tie. The results are recorded as follows:

Yiguang Ties Ji Zhu 1-1

Lihua Wins Jingwu 2-0

### Victory Cup Volleyball Tournament: Today's Fight for the Quarterfinals, Fuhua Women's Team Performs Against the Referees

The Victory Cup volleyball tournament will continue at the Jingwu Gymnasium on Sichuan North Road starting at 3:00 PM today. It includes four elimination preliminary matches, two championship semi-quarterfinal matches, and one exhibition match. The schedule is as follows:

Xiangjun vs. Turbine: 3:00 PM

Fanxing vs. Fuxingkai: 3:45 PM

Zhenhua vs. Jixian: 4:30 PM

Qingfeng vs. Watson's: 6:00 PM

Referees vs. Fuhua: 6:45 PM

St. John's vs. China Team: 7:30 PM

Elimination Matches

The first four matches are elimination matches. Xiangjun and Turbine are both participating in formal competitions for the first time and are fighting very earnestly. Tonight, they will compete fiercely. Fanxing and Fuxingkai lack technique and experience. Hopefully, they can participate in three league seasons to improve. The China team is in poor spirits, often competing with only seven players. They may be eliminated when they meet Jixian tonight. Tiemua has considerable strength and unfortunately lost to Jingwu in the first match. There should be no problem in defeating Nanyou.

Championship Matches

In the championship semi-quarterfinals, Watson's will face Qingfeng. The former has safely passed two rounds. If they win again tonight, they will participate in the championship, which is quite hopeful. The team's soldiers use their lives and never slacken, and their spirit is even better than their skills. In another match, St. John's will face the China team. St. John's is like a Class A team and has the ambition to win the championship. The generals of the China team are also very strong, and they will pose a serious threat to St. John's tonight.

Exhibition Match

In the exhibition match, the referees will play against the Fuhua women's team. Fuhua requested to participate, but the organizers did not allow them to join due to the regulations, so they were given an exhibition opportunity. Although the referees are used to enforcing the law, they also have some skills in spiking. There will be many wonderful performances at that time. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

Fuhua

Lü Xianchun, Zhu Qinmei, Lin Yinye

Wang Xiulin, Lü Liyuan, Bao Jia

Gu Shanshan, Mao Huixian, Zou Jingyun

Wu Qingzhu, Shao Jindi, Zhang Zhang

Referees

### Exciting Basketball Performance: Dagong vs. Mixed Team at the Gymnasium on Wednesday at 7:00 PM

[This Newspaper News] The Sports Reporters Association of this city will host a basketball performance to send off the Dagong basketball team, which is about to go abroad to the south, and to bid farewell to the city's fans. In addition, Li Shiqiao, a famous athlete of our country's World Games, is also in Shanghai to participate in the Dagong and go south with the team. This is a rare opportunity, so a basketball performance match will be organized to send them off. It has been approved by the Basketball Committee of the Municipal Sports Association and will be held at the Municipal Gymnasium on Shaanxi South Road at 7:00 PM on the 6th of this month (Wednesday). The Sports Reporters Association has also negotiated with the famous generals of the Hualian Chenyou Team to agree to sponsor and organize a mixed team to compete, with the aim of performing their basketball skills. Among the two teams, almost all of the main players of our country's World Games basketball team are included. This time, they will show their power abroad and have not yet appeared in Shanghai. It is inevitable that they will cause a sensation among the fans at that time.

### C1 Table Tennis League: Lingyun Wins the Finals Qualification

With another victory of 6-3, they won the finals qualification and will compete with Xingguang for the division championship on a scheduled date. In the B division, two games were also important battles. As a result, Luying Qingnian each won 6-3 against their opponents and advanced. However, the championship of this group is still the highest for Qingnian. Today (3rd), there will be three more games. Two games in C1 are of little significance.

### Crisis

— Wu Yong

I have long known that our country's Four Books and Five Classics, as well as Laozi, Zhuangzi, Liezi, and the like, have English translations. Visiting Western bookstores, I saw numerous books and pictorials written by Westerners about China, so many that one cannot count them all. Moreover, I discovered that Qu Yuan's works have translations in several languages, Sima Qian's Historical Records have a French translation by Mr. Edouard Chavannes, and there is a German monograph on Lü Buwei by Mr. Richard Wilhelm. I could not help but be surprised and admired the Westerners' enthusiasm for learning.

Some say this is not surprising, as our country also has Chinese translations of European and American works.

That's right.

However, looking at the current state of our culture from a broader perspective, there is indeed a reason for us to be pessimistic. For example, in terms of English-Chinese dictionaries, in terms of diligence and comprehensiveness, the existing ones in our country are mostly far inferior to similar products from Japan. Japanese-compiled English-Japanese dictionaries are often more accurate and detailed than our country's English-Chinese dictionaries. Looking back at Chinese-English dictionaries: So far, the more complete Chinese-English dictionaries are still the two compiled by Westerners H. Giles and Mathew. The Chinese-English dictionaries published by our country's publishing industry are mostly copied from Westerners; even if they are copied, they are not as complete. These types of works are being improved daily in Europe and America. As for our country, it is still the original few. To this day, we can't even afford to do the copying and printing work.

Furthermore, our "ancient" things were first studied using scientific methods by Stein and others who were not Chinese; the phonology of our Chinese characters was organized into a scientific system by Karlgren, who was not Chinese. Even some of our country's antiques, ancient books, and ancient paintings, you have to travel across the ocean to investigate and appreciate them. May I ask if our country has Shakespeare's manuscripts? Do we have authentic works by Raphael, Michelangelo, Rubens, and others? Things imported from abroad are naturally not absent, but most of them are things that you and I feel most distressed and fatal about. This is the reality, so why be surprised that culture is rolling away and foreign goods are coming in continuously?

Compared with the vigorous and prosperous situation of Western culture, what does this state of "substituting" indicate?

A recent article in the Listener Weekly discusses the crisis of world civilization, the gist of which is: (1) Civilizations can die; (2) The main cause of civilization death is war. The destruction of the Roman Empire is one example. In addition, more than 20 ancient civilizations in the past have declined and disappeared due to this; (3) If the scourge of war reaches a certain level, even if one side is defeated and one side wins, achieving a unified situation, it will be too late. Therefore, although there is peace at this time, it is only a peace due to exhaustion, and so on. These words are chilling and terrifying, not just sad.

### The Rich Area of America

— Mao Yi

Millionaires have long been common and unremarkable in the southwestern American states of Texas and Oklahoma. Now there are many people with assets of five million US dollars here, because there are too many, so they are only considered "well-off." Only when a person accumulates assets of about thirty million US dollars is he considered "wealthy."

Texas oilman Haralson L. Hunt is probably the richest among the wealthy, and possibly the richest individual among Americans, because he is accustomed to quietness, hates cameras, and does not like to show off, so he is unknown, and even most of his fellow villagers do not know him. Hunt's oil mine property is estimated to be worth about 263 million US dollars. His total weekly income is more than one million US dollars.

The number of wealthy people in the southwest is truly astonishing. For example, in Fort Worth, a newspaper published a news item saying that the income tax paid by a certain family in 1947 was 3,447,000 yuan. Although there is such a clue, readers cannot accurately guess which family "a certain family" is, because there are nearly 20 families in the local area who may need to pay such a huge tax!

With more money, spending is naturally extravagant. Jewelers in Houston, Texas, do not find a transaction of 20,000 US dollars to be rare. Three stores selling women's supplies in the area say that selling clothes priced from 400 to 1,000 yuan is not difficult. A store recently put out four sable fur hats priced at 1,500 yuan each, and they were sold out on the first day. Last February, a car company in Dallas sold two cars priced at nearly 20,000 yuan each on its opening day. Another car dealer sold more than 1,000 cars last year.

The Neiman Marcus department store in Dallas has about 90,000 charge account customers, of which nearly 300 customers spend more than 50,000 yuan a year, and a few customers spend 150,000 yuan a year on goods! The extravagance can be seen from this.

### Generals of the Yang Family

— Ji Yun

The story of the Yang family generals has long been deeply rooted in society and is known to women and children. Especially general theatergoers, regarding Cheng Changgeng's "Fourth Son Visits His Mother," Tan Xinpei's "Li Ling Stele," and all the plays of the Yang family, feel more and more enjoyable to talk about and listen to with relish. However, according to historical facts, there are many differences. A brief account is as follows:

(1) Yang Ye: Ye is the main character in the play "Li Ling Stele," and is now honored as Lord Yang. Originally a famous general of the Northern Han, formerly known as Liu Jiye, after the surrender of the Northern Han, he still fought hard to defend the city. Emperor Taizong of Song ordered the Lord of the Northern Han to recruit him before he surrendered. He resumed the surname Yang, only named Ye, and was appointed as the governor of Daizhou. He was famous for his good fighting, and people at that time called him Yang the Invincible. He once led hundreds of cavalry to break 100,000 Khitan soldiers. The Khitan were afraid and fled whenever they saw his banners. Later, he was harmed by Wang Shen, who forced him to go to Shuozhou and was ambushed and defeated. He fought hard and suffered dozens of injuries. Most of his soldiers were killed. He was shot and fell from his horse and was captured. He died without eating. His son Yanyu also died in battle. More than 100 people remained under his command. When defeated, Ye ordered them to escape and return, but they were grateful and refused to retreat, and also died in battle. According to the plot of Li Ling, although there are many additional details, it is generally not contrary to the facts.

(2) Pan Mei: Mei was a famous general of the Song Dynasty, with great military achievements. He is commonly known as the traitorous Pan Renmei, or Pan Hong, which is probably a shadow on Mei. According to the records, when attacking the Khitan, Mei was the chief deployment officer, and Ye was his deputy. They won every battle. When Cao Bin's army was defeated, they were summoned back. At that time, the Khitan were powerful, and the generals abandoned the city and fled. Mei went to rescue but was also defeated. Ye believed that it would only lose soldiers and be of no benefit, so he advocated avoiding their edge. The supervising army, Shen, said that Ye was always known as invincible, and not fighting was a sign of disloyalty. He had no choice but to lead his troops to Shuozhou, and agreed with Mei to deploy troops at Chenjiagukou for support. Mei agreed. The Khitan pretended to be defeated to lure Ye. Shen thought they had won and led his troops forward to compete for merit. When he heard of the defeat, he led his troops to escape, and Mei could not control him. Ye fought to the valley and did not see a single soldier. He cried bitterly and fought again, and was captured and died. It can be seen that the one who harmed Ye was Shen, and it is not in line with the facts to attribute the traitor to Mei. (Note: Shen was very treacherous and once falsely accused Tian Renlang. After Ye's death, he was removed from office.)

(3) Yang Yanzhao: Yanzhao was Ye's son, commonly known as Yang Liulang. When the Khitan invaded on a large scale, the Song army was defeated, and they took advantage of the victory to attack the city. The city was small and unprepared, and the people were in fear. Yanzhao gathered the people and defended the city firmly. The weather was very cold, and the water poured on the city turned into ice, which was firm and slippery and could not be climbed. The Khitan then withdrew. He was re-elected as a frontier general and ordered to be in charge of Baozhou. At that time, it was said that he was the right person.

(4) Empress Xiao: The Empress was the wife of the Khitan lord Xian and the mother of Longxu. She monopolized power for many years, had resourcefulness, and was good at controlling ministers. She personally wore armor to supervise the battle in every battle. She also conspired to make peace with the Song. However, she was cruel and bloodthirsty and had an affair with Prime Minister Han Derang. Not long after the Queen died, Derang also died and was buried next to her mausoleum.

According to the above historical facts, it can be seen that the Yang family generals were not fictitious, but Pan Mei was not without injustice, and Empress Xiao was promiscuous and cruel, similar to the Empress Dowager Cixi of the Qing Dynasty. However, her military exploits and political achievements, and the fact that her son Longxu mourned to the point of death after her death, were all things that the Empress Dowager Cixi could not match.

### Returning to Thatched Cottage in Autumn

— Chen Dingshan

High willows and broken bridge to the west of the gate, climbing the steps, you can lift your steps. You can hear the joy of crows and sparrows in vain. Recent people pay to let butterflies fly low.

Are the old osmanthus trees in the mountains all in bloom? Half-yellow is covered with family rice wine in the house. The sunny skies have delayed for ten days, and heavy sunshine and rain will unfold on the Double Ninth Festival.

The rice congee is smooth like flowing, and the mountains are great, so I will seek rice for survival first. I stopped my cup and try to tell of my healthy body. Unexpectedly there is a new pine covered with snow on its head. (New snow on pines in the country)

Flowers closed and withered, revealing the empty island. Short water caltrop and long arrowhead fill the eyes in autumn. I suspect new poems are born in the depths of my eyes. Hanging willows are separated by a heavy sorrow.

### Fierce Bean

— Liuyun

Not stained by silt, lotus is called the gentleman; alone in her later years, the chrysanthemum is admired as a superior. Strong grass in a strong wind, pine and cypress in the cold winter, are all worthy of being valued. Among the green beans, there is also the so-called "fierce bean." Zheng Eryang of the Ming Dynasty said: "Often there are green beans that do not rot when cooked. People call them fierce beans, also called iron beans, and the name is very good. In the midst of fierce fire and boiling water, all the beans are糜烂 (mí làn, mushy), but this bean alone can be firm as iron, with eyes intact, without any damage. It can truly be said to enter water without getting wet, and enter fire without burning. It is appropriate to call it fierce!... I often say that even when the world is vast and extremely decayed, there must be places that are not decayed. Relying on the ordinary sight and hearing outside of prosperity, there is a generation of blood-boiling men. One cannot say that a clear and bright world has been completely ruined by those who want to ride crane carriages and wear monkey hats."

In the midst of fierce fire and boiling water, without following the 糜烂 of the beans, but being firm and intact alone, it is fitting to call them fierce. It is known that hardship and danger are indeed the great touchstones of humanity. And "even when the world is vast and extremely decayed, there must be places that are not decayed," this is why history continues. Loyal, righteous, and independent scholars never cease in history, and it is precisely by relying on such blood-boiling men outside of ordinary sight and hearing that a righteous spirit is left for heaven and earth.

### Eastern Scales and Western Claws

— Jinlin

Southern California in the United States has the world's largest aqueduct, with a total length of 242 miles, most of which can be driven by cars. It is used to supply drinking water to 13 city residents, providing 1,000,000,000 gallons of water per day.

When a hummingbird is flying, it flaps its wings 75 times per second, and when soaring, it flaps 40 times per second. This is based on counts from high-speed cameras.

Everyone thinks that the country with the most inventors in the world is either the United States or Germany. In fact, in proportion to the population, the country with the most inventors is Switzerland.

Yellowstone Park in the United States covers an area of ​​3,500 square miles. In terms of hot springs alone, there are already two or three hundred. The magnificent beauty of the scenery is amazing!

### Good People and Bad People

— Erjia

Wu Sansi said: "I don't know who are good people and who are bad people in the world; but those who are good to me are good people, and those who are bad to me are bad people." Yuan Jianzhai said: "This kind of view is often held by the virtuous gentlemen of today, and even Cheng and Zhu in ancient times could not avoid falling into this disease, but they are not willing to say it as directly as Wu Sansi." Looking at Sansi's words today, they still feel fresh and pleasing.

### The Limit of Self-Preservation

— Erjia

Yang Jimin of Ming Dynasty's Mingliang Records said: "When Qian Fangbo was an imperial censor, he confiscated the property of the eunuch Wang Zhen. There was a golden Guanyin statue with an inscription on the back: Filial grandson Zhou Chen worships, dedicated by Duke Wenxiang." The note says: "This is similar to Xie Taifu enduring hunger and fatigue to see Huan Wen. Is it to preserve oneself wisely, regardless of minor setbacks?"

In reality, a gentleman's "preserving oneself wisely" should not lose his integrity too much. For example, Chen Taiqiu's mourning for Zhang Rang and Du Zhengnan's bribery of courtiers do not lose the meaning of preserving oneself wisely. If Zhou Chen offers tribute to Wang Chen and calls himself "filial grandson", this is the lowest level of flattery, no different from sucking ass and licking hemorrhoids. How can it be compared to Xie Taichuan's enduring hunger and fatigue, and only called a "minor setback"?

As for using self-preservation as an excuse to become a traitor, accept unjust wealth, and so on, it goes without saying.

### Reading Churchill's Memoirs

— Lezhi

Churchill's book is a famous work in English. I have read both the Commercial Press translation and the original text. Britain was in a very difficult position during World War II. Churchill shouldered heavy responsibilities, and retired successfully. Naturally, there are many words to warn against past failures and instruct the future. This book was not casually written. The subtle meaning of the whole book does not lie in blaming past misfortunes, but in reminding the world that politics is ultimately not rational but emotional. Because it is not rational, so mistakes are repeated, and people knowingly commit them. If things go on like this, the world order will still not be guaranteed, which means that mankind's political ideals have not yet been fully realized. Moreover, from the perspective of combining the past and present, the inside and outside, and the dynamic and static aspects, it is still doubtful whether humans are good creatures with political abilities. Reading Churchill's book, one is not saddened by the past, but more fearful for the future.

He said: The national character of the British is peace-loving, but when danger comes, the more dangerous, the more calm, and the more unbreakable. This must be very correct. However, every nation in the world has its national characteristics. How can we understand the characteristics of each nation and make them progress together peacefully? If the Germans had understood the British characteristics earlier, they would probably not have launched military action against Poland. Then there would have been the possibility of avoiding or delaying the war until several years later before it started. Hitler mistakenly thought that Chamberlain was an honest and deceivable person, so he dared to take great risks. This is probably the meaning Churchill wants to explain. In the early stages of World War II, Britain was the master and the United States was the follower. After the war, the situation was that the United States was the master and Britain was the follower. At that time, Germany mistakenly thought that Britain and the United States were weak, and tried step by step. After a few years, some people mistakenly thought that Britain and the United States were weak, and tried step by step. Before 1939, who could determine when Britain and the United States would rise up and take up arms? Churchill said that the two pages of history will not be entirely the same, there will always be some different nuances. How profound and sad are these words? The small details are different, but the big patterns are simply repeated.

Not only wars, but also the political, economic, and cultural problems in peacetime are the same as before, and even problems that have been around for hundreds of years have not been improved. The various nations of Europe have many innate problems that they cannot solve, and even their own shortcomings cannot be improved. When there is danger, there is a burst of anxiety; once things have passed, everything remains the same. Churchill's description of various circumstances, for his British allies and foreign countries, is naturally very euphemistic and unwilling to expose their shortcomings, but it is also enough to see their corruption. As far as Britain is concerned, its political system is indeed sounder than other countries, and it can maintain stability and respond to changes. The general situation of the society is also worthy of being able to endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens to seek survival from death. Churchill fully represents British politicians, and his phase industry is admirable. However, the position of Britain is not to allow one country to be too strong, and yet some countries must be strong enough to watch the door for her. How can this two-way question be done well?

The translation is quite smooth and fluent, especially the fact that it is composed by many hands but does not show any inconsistencies before and after, and is simply as if it came from one hand, which is very rare and valuable. However, some of the subtle places in the original text where emotion and language are intertwined cannot be expressed properly. Therefore, I think that our current popular writing style, in addition to explanatory writing, seems to be still poor and monotonous, and does not teach twists and turns and richness.

### Reader Consultation: Renting a House Without a Contract is Considered an Indefinite Lease

Yu Shen asked: I recently rented a room from a friend, which is between their affairs/servant quarter and the inner rooms. I have now moved in and registered my household. Because our friendship is harmonious, we did not draw up a lease contract, and there are no receipts for the rent paid. May I ask, according to this fact, is there a rental relationship established in law? Can registering my household be an indication of renting? I respectfully ask for your guidance, and I am greatly grateful. [Answered by Lawyer Chuan Kuangling] Regarding the situation described in your letter, renting the room and registering your household without a written contract is considered an indefinite lease, which is legally valid.
