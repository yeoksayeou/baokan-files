### U.S. President Reiterates Stance on China: Helping Our Government Maintain Peace, Expanding the Foundation Does Not Include the CCP

[U.S. News Service, Washington, 11th] President Truman reiterated the U.S. policy toward China at a press conference on the 11th, as stated in his December 15, 1945 declaration, which suggests that the foundation of the Chinese government should be expanded. He painstakingly explained that this policy does not mean that the Communist Party should be included. In answering questions about China, the President acknowledged some confusion between the terms "Communist Party" and "free individuals" in China. He explained that communists are those who believe in governing the country from the top down through a totalitarian government. He pointed out that there are many free individuals in China, many of whom have been educated in the United States, forming an intellectual class. He hopes that these people can be included in the expanded foundation of the Chinese government. This topic was raised when a journalist asked the President if U.S. policy still favored including the Communist Party in the Chinese government. The President replied that he was not aware that this had ever been U.S. policy. He pointed out that the United States has been on friendly terms with the Chinese government and is currently trying to help the recognized government maintain peace. When asked if expanding the Chinese government meant including the Communist Party, Truman replied, "No," and reiterated his answer. When asked if the President could explain General Marshall's mission to China in 1946, the President said it was an effort to help the government cope with the situation at the time. Then a reporter pointed out that Marshall, in his report after returning from China, had suggested including the Communist Party in the government. The President replied that he did not think General Marshall needed the Communist Party to join the Chinese government. The President also said that he did not want the Communist Party to join the government of China or any other country. (Note: In his report on China, Marshall expressed the hope that during the transitional period of government reorganization in China, "the door will be open to the Communist Party or other groups to join if they can jointly bear responsibility for the future of China.") (The Secretary of State further recounted that before the President issued the policy statement, the Chinese themselves had agreed to hold a political consultative conference, including representatives from all parties and factions, but the agreement reached at the meeting was not fulfilled.)

U.S. State Department Issues Statement Explaining Secretary Marshall's Policy on China

[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] The U.S. State Department issued a formal statement on the afternoon of the 11th to clarify Secretary Marshall's description of U.S. policy toward China at a press conference yesterday, as the Secretary of State's views on the China issue have caused misunderstandings. The State Department pointed out that Marshall's reference to President Truman's December 15, 1945 statement on China was to indicate that the United States believes that "if the foundation of the Chinese government is expanded to accommodate other political elements in the country, it will be beneficial to China's peaceful unification and democratic reform." The State Department stated that Marshall firmly believes that Truman's statement is still valid. The State Department's statement continued: "Yesterday, Secretary Marshall was specifically asked whether expanding the foundation of the Chinese government necessarily meant accommodating the CCP?" Marshall replied that the Communist Party has now openly betrayed the government, so this matter "is whether or not to resolutely allow the Communist Party to participate in the government" and is for the Chinese government to decide; the U.S. government cannot overstep its bounds. Because Marshall's answer to the above question was originally just a "yes," the reporters misinterpreted it to mean that the U.S. State Department still insisted that the CCP must participate in a united central government. The State Department's explanation today is generally considered to be fundamentally inconsistent with the newspaper's interpretation of Marshall's views. Regarding the State Department's explanation, it is generally believed that Marshall has withdrawn his previous claim that the CCP must participate in the reorganized united government of China. The State Department's formal statement today may have been prompted by the differing interpretations of Marshall's remarks in the newspapers.

### U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Decides to Draft Unified Foreign Aid Plan: Economic Aid to China Included in Aid to Europe Plan

[U.S. News Service, Washington, 11th] Republican members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee met with House Speaker Martin and Majority Leader Halleck on the 11th and decided to support an overall foreign aid plan, which will then be divided into two categories: one for the European Recovery Program and economic and relief assistance to China, and the other for military assistance to China, Greece, and Turkey. This matter will continue to be discussed on Friday, and the committee is scheduled to begin drafting legislation on Monday. The economic portion of the House plan is similar to the European Recovery Act currently being discussed in the Senate but will include $570 million in economic aid to China. The Senate Foreign Affairs Committee has not drafted any legislation on military assistance to Greece, Turkey, and China, and the administration has not requested military assistance. Any foreign aid agreement finally passed by the House and Senate must resolve any differences in a conference.

[United Press, Washington, 11th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee, despite opposition from the administration, included military assistance in the European Recovery Program bill on the 11th. Committee Chairman Eaton said that the committee will begin drafting a two-part bill on the 12th, providing economic assistance to China and the sixteen countries of Western Europe. This bill will also include providing appropriate military assistance to China, Greece, and Turkey. Eaton did not indicate when this bill would reach the House.

### Foreign Affairs Personnel Foreshadow: Three Key Points of Military Assistance Aimed at Ensuring Our Victory in Suppressing Communists

[United Press, Washington, 11th] According to sources in the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the night of the 11th, the military assistance to China, which they previously decided to include in the overall European Recovery and China Assistance package, will include a three-point plan aimed at ensuring President Chiang's victory in the war against the Communists. So far, it is understood that military assistance will include the following three points:

(1) Supplying surplus ammunition and other war equipment.

(2) Allocating cash for China to purchase necessary armaments factory machinery, chemicals, and mineral products in the United States for China to manufacture ammunition.

(3) Changing the U.S. military delegation in Nanjing so that the delegation can directly fight on the battlefield.

They said that the actual cash allocation required for military assistance to China that the committee members believed was necessary would be less than what was speculated. They pointed out that the cost of surplus assets would not be high in the appropriation bill, and the military delegation was already in China. The only cash needed would be for purchasing machinery, chemicals, and mineral products that cannot be obtained in China for China to build its own armaments industry. The committee members said that they hope that the U.S. military advisory group in Nanjing will no longer be subject to the control of the State Department. They stressed that this would be a necessary route due to the State Department's opposition to military assistance to China. Some congressional figures believe that the actual cost of military assistance to China in the coming year will not exceed $100 million because the committee believes that most of the materials can be obtained from surplus materials.

### Civil Aviation Pilot Talks About Encounter with Soviet Aircraft Attack

"Also said, "After our plane landed safely in Qingdao, the situation was reported to the authorities, and the US military authorities stationed in Qingdao sent two planes to search, but nothing was found. "Finally, Bauer showed three photos he took when the "Red Star" plane was pursuing.

According to the person in charge of the Committee when meeting with the Central News Agency reporter: The committee, according to the Sino-U.S. relief agreement, can handle about $48 million worth of relief supplies aided to China by the United States, mainly food. Of the $48 million, $30 million is allocated to China in the U.S. foreign aid plan, and the other $18 million is another emergency loan from the United States. After deducting various expenses, the total is about $44.5 million, equivalent to 150,000 tons of food. According to the Sino-U.S. agreement, U.S. representatives can assist our government in handling it. National distribution matters, the proceeds from the sale can be directly used for relief expenses; at the same time, it is stipulated that our country should also raise the same amount of food. Therefore, this relief food is a total of 250,000 tons. After consultation between China and the United States, a four-month trial run was first conducted, and Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, Tianjin, and 　were temporarily the main five metropolitan cities. It was agreed that the Food Department would 　the grain distribution in March, the U.S. grain distribution in April, the municipal government grain distribution in May, and the U.S. grain distribution in June. Currently, the grain to be raised by the Food Department and various municipal governments has been raised, and the U.S. grain is also being shipped to China one after another. As for the general office of the U.S. government's China Relief Corps, there are offices in Shanghai, Qingdao, Nanjing, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. According to the Sino-U.S. relief agreement, U.S. representatives are in contact with our government at any time. If they disagree with our government's handling of the relief supplies, they have the right to withhold U.S. relief food. The expenses of the group are separately used from the proceeds from the sale of U.S. relief supplies.

### A Comparison of the Rate of Industrial Production in the United States and the Soviet Union

— Wu Jingchao

When comparing the rate of industrial production in the United States and the Soviet Union, there is a difficult problem: the choice of time period. If we compare the rate of production in the two countries after 1917, it seems unfair to the United States, because after 1917, the industrialization of the United States had reached a considerable level, while the Soviet Union can be said to have just begun. The rate of industrial production in a country that is just beginning to industrialize is always higher, just as a baby's growth rate cannot be compared with that of an adult. To give an example, a country that only produces ten cars a year, if it produces twenty cars the second year, its rate has doubled. Another country, if it can already produce a thousand cars in the first year, even if it increases production by two hundred cars in the second year, its rate will only increase by 20%. Therefore, when we compare the rate of industrial production in the two countries, we cannot compare the situation after the founding of the Soviet Union with the situation in the United States during the same period. Another method is to compare the rate of industrial production in the United States from 1870 to 1900 with the rate of industrial production in the Soviet Union from 1918 to 1948. The length of these two periods is the same, both thirty years. The production equipment in the United States in 1870 was彷彿 to the production equipment in the Soviet Union in 1918. If we compare the production rates of these two periods, it may give us an answer, telling us whether the rate of development in a capitalist country can keep up with that of a socialist country. However, this kind of comparison is unfair to both the United States and the Soviet Union. It is unfair to the United States because the production technology of the 19th century was far inferior to that of the 20th century. The production technology that the United States was able to use in the thirty years after 1870 was far inferior to that which the Soviet Union was able to use in the thirty years after 1918. It is unfair to the Soviet Union because those thirty years for the United States were太平日子. Americans could develop their domestic economy in a state of无外患内发, while the Soviet Union had two or three years of内忧 and five or six years of外患 in those thirty years. The strength of construction was sometimes offset by the strength of destruction. Therefore, this comparison also has difficulties.

After adopting various comparison methods, I feel that one method is more appropriate. This method is to choose the most favorable period of development within the development period of the Soviet Union. I have selected the period from 1928 to 1940. 1928 was the date the Soviet Union began implementing its first five-year plan. 1940 was the year before the Soviet Union joined the European War. During these twelve years, the Soviet Union implemented a planned economy, mobilizing the strength of the whole country to develop its national power in a state of peace. The Soviet Union's development plan emphasized industry over agriculture, and heavy industry over light industry. From various industrial production statistics, we have specifically selected the production of coal, steel, and oil in heavy industry to compare with the United States. These three materials are the foundation of industrialization and are also what the Soviet Union valued most.

We first find out the production of these three materials in the Soviet Union in 1928, and then find out the economic history of the Soviet Union twelve years later, that is, 1940, to see which year's production of each material was similar to the Soviet Union's production in 1928, and which year's production was similar to the Soviet Union's production in 1940. I say similar instead of equal, because it is difficult to find years with equal output in the production statistics, which are based on years.

The production of the three materials in the Soviet Union in 1928 and 1940 is listed below:

Material Unit 1928 Production 1940 Production

Coal Million tons 29.1 164.7

Steel Same as above 4.2 21.8

Oil Same as above 9.2 34.2

The years and production of these three materials in the United States that can be compared with the Soviet Union are listed below:

Starting from the period when the production of coal in the United States was similar to that of the Soviet Union in 1928, it took 21 years to reach a production similar to that of the Soviet Union in 1940. Using the same method, it shows that the increase in steel production took 15 years, and the increase in oil production took 13 years. One point that needs to be added here is that regarding steel production, there are two statements about the Soviet Union's production in 1940, one is 21.8 million tons and the other is 18.4 million tons. I have adopted the higher statistics here. If the lower statistics are adopted, then starting from the period when the steel production of the United States was similar to that of the Soviet Union in 1928, it would not take 15 years to reach the Soviet Union's production in 1940. On average: it took 16.3 years for the production of these three materials in the United States, starting from the period when the production was similar to that of the Soviet Union in 1928, to reach a production similar to that of the Soviet Union in 1940.

Comparing twelve years with sixteen years and some months, it seems that the rate of production under capitalism is not as good as the rate of production under socialism. But it is difficult to make this kind of determination. First, we have only compared the rate of production of three materials. If we increase the types of materials, especially if we also select a few consumer goods and include them in the calculation, the result will definitely be different. Unfortunately, this kind of statistical data is not easy to collect. Secondly, we must pay attention to the fact that the United States had already reached the production of the Soviet Union in 1940 for the above three materials before World War I. Before World War I, the technology of production was far less advanced than after World War I. The method of steelmaking used in the United States between 1890 and 1905 was definitely not as new as the method used in the Soviet Union between 1928 and 1940. Therefore, the comparison method I adopted is generally unfair to the United States. But even under this kind of not very fair comparison method, the performance of the United States is not much different from that of the Soviet Union. Therefore, this kind of comparison is a very valuable reference material for us to judge the merits of the two systems.

### Chairman Chiang's Arbor Day Address: Encouraging National Afforestation and Forest Protection; Governments at All Levels to Provide Technical Assistance

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 12th] The Capital's Arbor Day Commemoration Conference was held at 10 a.m. on the 12th in the auditorium of the Central Forestry Experimental Institute. More than 70 representatives from various agencies attended, and Mr. Wang, an American advisor to the Ministry of Agriculture, and two others also participated. At the meeting, Chairman Chiang's instruction was read out. Minister Zuo Shunsheng presided over the meeting and said: the密茂 of forests is quite enough to symbolize the興盛 and 進步 of a country. Mayor Shen Yi said in his speech that he was deeply悠慨 that there are still many濯濯童山 in the suburbs of Beijing. He agreed with Minister Zuo's opinion that Arbor Day should be a day for us to警惕振奋, not just虛應故事. In addition, the Beijing Municipal Garden Construction Committee, in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Municipal Government, plans to plant 8 million seedlings this year. The committee convened its inaugural meeting at Zhonglin Institute immediately after the Arbor Day Commemoration Conference.

Chairman Chiang's instruction: Forests have a great impact on human life. Our country is based on agriculture, and developing forestry is especially an urgent task for national economic construction. In the past, the people have not deeply understood the benefits of forests, so although afforestation has been carried out for many years, after afforestation, no attention has been paid to forest protection, resulting in insignificant results, which is regrettable. The purpose of holding Arbor Day is to form an action to awaken the people and gradually develop the habit of automatic afforestation and forest protection. Only when this good atmosphere is普及全國 can afforestation be successful. The government can only do its best to select seeds, cultivate seedlings, and promote guidance, while the implementation of planting and protection relies on the power of the whole people. In the future, governments at all levels must actively promote the afforestation movement, store large quantities of seedlings, provide them to the people free of charge, provide assistance in planting technology, and supervise townships, towns, and Baojia to automatically establish forest protection organizations. After ten years, the trees will become a forest, and the utilization will be 厚生, which can be拭目可俟. The Mushan area of Nanjing has 天時地利's excellent conditions, and I hope that the competent authorities will speed up the implementation of the Capital's Ten-Year Afforestation Plan, which was previously ordered, to provide a model for the whole country, and I hope for it.

### Relieving Northeastern Refugees: Adopting Agriculture and Industry Relief Methods

Petition Group Makes Suggestions to the Social Department

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 12th] The Northeast Petition Group was invited by Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs for a banquet at 7:00 p.m. on the 12th and put forward specific opinions on the Northeast relief issue. It is roughly estimated that the number of refugees in various parts of Northeast China who are currently流亡集於 Shenyang has reached 1.2 million, 70,000 in Jilin and Changchun, about 10,000 in Jinzhou, and about 100,000 in Xinmin, Fushun, and Tieling combined, of which about 300,000 rely on粥厂s for their livelihoods. The emergency relief funds issued by the Ministry of Social Affairs and the relief funds raised by Madam Chiang last winter were barely enough to get them through. By February of this year, they had almost all been停顿. At present, it is urgent to continue maintaining the 粥厂s. However, based on one catty of Gaoliang rice per person per day, the minimum price of each catty is 4,000 circulation coupons, and 36 billion circulation coupons are needed each month. Please allocate emergency relief funds immediately to handle this. However, it is not a long-term solution for refugees to rely on 粥厂s for their livelihoods, so it is recommended to adopt 농赈 and 工赈 methods to seek a long-term solution. The delegation is scheduled to send Zhang Binci and Tian Yushi to attend the Resident Committee of the参政会 on the 13th to report on the situation in the Northeast, and is scheduled to hold a press conference at 3:00 p.m. on the 13th to report on the petition process.

The original plan listed (A) the total amount of issuance as 50 billion yuan, (B) the issuance method as follows: it will be issued concurrently when handling land loans for purchasing land at appraised value, land requisition loans, and supporting self-cultivating farmers. Landowners will be required to hand over the bonds to the landowners to compensate for the land price. It will also be issued at the discretion of the municipal improvement loan, or it will be publicly sold to absorb cash according to the financial market situation for land improvement and land consolidation loans. (C) The interest rate is still set at 6% per annum. (D) For the repayment period, in order to protect the interests of bondholders, the repayment period is shortened by two years compared to the second period and set at five years. (E) Repayment method: Most land mortgage loans are of an amortized nature, so this bond also adopts an equal installment repayment method for both principal and interest, repaying principal and interest once a year. However, if necessary, it may be repaid early at any time after two years from the date of issuance. (F) This bond is divided into four types: 100,000 yuan, 250,000 yuan, 500,000 yuan, and 1 million yuan. It is reported that the bond is registered, and an impression or signature must be left when receiving the bond for verification. However, it can be changed to a bearer bond upon request of the bondholder. The bond will begin to repay principal and interest after one full year from the date of issuance, and will be repaid in one payment of principal and interest each year thereafter, and will be cleared in five years, but may be repaid early at any time after two years from the date of issuance. The bond is secured by all the assets of the China Farmers Bank and its Land Finance Office and the land mortgage rights obtained from its loans. Bondholders must redeem the principal and interest at maturity within ten years with the bond, otherwise it will be invalid. If it is lost, the bondholder shall immediately report the loss to the China Farmers Bank and publish a statement declaring it invalid. After two months, if there is no dispute, the China Farmers Bank will reissue a new bond.

### Five-Nation Conference in Brussels Passes 50-Year Mutual Defense Treaty; Full Text to be Published After Signing Next Wednesday

[United Press, Beirut, 12th] The five Western European nations, under the leadership of the United Kingdom and France, passed an unprecedented 50-year military alliance charter on the 12th to stem the westward advance of communism. (Moscow Radio immediately attacked the treaty, saying that it lacked legal force or international authority because the people of the five countries were not consulted.) The treaty stipulates that if any of the five countries, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, is subjected to external attack, this treaty is considered the basis for a Western European alliance that stretches from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Mediterranean Sea in the south. It is generally hoped that many countries will participate in the military alliance when the 16 countries of the Marshall Plan meet in Paris next Monday. At the end of the meeting, the representatives of the five countries walked out of the venue, in a pleasant mood, talking and laughing. British representative Jebb said that he would fly back to London on the 12th, and other representatives also said that they would return to their countries as soon as possible on the 12th to submit the draft treaty to their respective governments. It is believed that the foreign ministers of the five countries plan to sign the treaty at the Brussels conference on Wednesday. Reliable sources said that the mutual assistance clause in the treaty stipulates that in the event of aggression, the five countries should automatically provide military assistance. If there are disputes between the contracting parties, they should appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. The official text of the new treaty has not yet been published, and the communiqué only states that the treaty includes economic, social, cultural, and mutual assistance clauses. After the foreign ministers of the five countries sign the alliance treaty next week, it is expected that the governments of each country will publish its contents. The Five-Nation Conference was stimulated by the Czech coup and the Finnish incident and agreed to establish a draft treaty within nine days. It is believed that this is a new record for the speed of the creation of an important treaty. It is reported that with the passage of the economic clauses of the treaty, the overseas territories of the five countries will form a group, and it is expected that the implementation of the clauses will be the responsibility of a permanent consultative committee, which may be established in London.

[Reuters, London, 11th] The Five-Nation Western European Alliance Treaty is expected to be signed in Brussels next Wednesday, and British Foreign Secretary Bevin may personally attend. The tentative timetable is that Bevin will leave London for Paris on Sunday to participate in the European Sixteen-Nation Reconstruction Plan Conference, which will open at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs next Monday. In his capacity as the head of the British delegation, he will deliver a speech to the plenary meeting on Monday afternoon or Tuesday. On Tuesday evening, he will travel by train from Paris to Brussels and sign the Five-Nation Western European Alliance Treaty the next day, returning to London on Thursday. According to people at the Brussels Conference, the Five-Nation Western European Alliance Treaty has a validity period of 50 years, and the full text includes a general outline and ten chapters. The general outline should include several clauses, stating that the main purpose of the treaty is to maintain freedom and democracy. People in London are particularly interested in the exact form of the security clause in the Five-Nation Alliance, because most of the security portion of the German issue discussed by the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium in London in mid-April depends on the security clause in the Western European Alliance. It is believed here that the Brussels meeting is the link between the two meetings of the Six-Nation German Issue Conference in London and the European Sixteen-Nation Conference. For example, the clause in the Brussels Convention regarding allowing new countries to join the Western European Alliance will inevitably be discussed at the Paris Sixteen-Nation Conference. If the economic connections in the Five-Nation Western European Alliance Treaty are more detailed, it will delay other countries from joining the alliance under equal conditions. The Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg group had already advocated at the Brussels meeting that the five original signatory countries maintain the highest possible level of economic cooperation, so it is expected that they will not welcome other countries to participate in such close economic ties until the economic value of the Western European Alliance can be truly explained. The mutual assistance clause in the Five-Nation Western European Alliance Treaty should aim to avoid the resentment of the Soviet Union as much as possible, and the defense provisions therein should also be based on Europe as much as possible to avoid the impression of forming a anti-Soviet alliance and conform to the purpose and spirit of the United Nations Charter.

### The United States Pours All Political Forces to Prevent the Spread of Communist Forces; Truman Emphasizes That the Belief in Peace Has Been Shaken; Marshall Urges People to Maintain a Calm Attitude

[United Press, Washington, 12th] President Truman has today poured all of America's prestige and political power to curb the spread of communism throughout the world, while the government has begun to draft five plans to cope with what Secretary of State Marshall calls a major world crisis, including the Marshall European Recovery Plan, encouraging the organization of a Western European alliance, opposing the spread of communism in China and other places, continuing to work for peace despite difficulties, and striving to restrain the emotionalism of the American people. Both Truman and Marshall made statements in a very frank manner about the situation caused by the fierce conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. The president openly admitted that his belief in achieving true world peace had been shaken, which was a first.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 11th] President Truman told reporters today that recent events in Europe have shaken his confidence in world peace, but he still believes that peace can be maintained and must be so in order to avoid the destruction of the world. He went on to explain the Truman Doctrine, saying that the purpose of this doctrine is to curb the expansion of communism, which will remain the main part of American foreign policy and a prerequisite for the European Reconstruction Plan. The president also answered inquiries about rumors that he would meet with Marshal Stalin, saying, "There is no basis for such rumors, and no one has contacted me about such a meeting."

[United Press, Washington, 11th] Marshall said in a speech at the United American Church Joint Conference, attended by President Truman and others, that the current world is in a "great crisis" and that Americans should handle it with calm judgment. A few hours earlier, President Truman had also said at a press conference that the recent developments in Europe have shaken his long-held belief in world peace.

Marshall said, "The whole world is in a great crisis of mutual accusation, suspicion, and misunderstanding. In this turmoil, the situation has been further complicated by the competitive movement. At this time, it is very important for everyone to express their opinions in moderate terms." He said that there has never been a greater need for calm judgment than now, and everyone should recognize the material, spiritual, and political conditions of other parts of the world and judge everything with conscience. Marshall said that he has only one positive request to the American people, which is to enact and implement the European payment plan. He criticized the domestic and foreign atmosphere slightly, saying, "Some foreigners misunderstand almost every foreign country, and we can only be patient, otherwise we will fail in action due to fear." Marshall also praised the five countries, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, for their discussion of the Western European Alliance in Brussels, saying that this is the first step in realizing many great dreams.

### US Senate Continues Debate on Marshall Plan

Senator Vandenberg Quibbles

[Reuters, Washington, 11th] The Senate has been debating the Marshall European Aid Program for ten days. Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, expressed dissatisfaction during today's debate with some senators' quibbling over the wording of the bill. He emphasized that if the European Reconstruction Plan is to be implemented within the planned timeframe, this type of debate must not continue. Republican Senator Capehart introduced an amendment to the European Reconstruction Plan bill, which would abolish the European Reconstruction Plan and invest in a European Reconstruction Plan organized by private enterprise. Vandenberg strongly opposed it and demanded that the Senate reject it. The amendment will be put to a vote on Friday.

### Churchill Calls for Organization of United States of Europe

[Central News Agency, London, 11th] The News Communications Magazine yesterday published a letter from Churchill initiating the United States of Europe movement, and Churchill also called on all sectors to support it. The purpose of this movement is to create a common and consistent opinion. If there is a concept that everyone is European in the minds of the general public, governments will quickly take practical action. Churchill believes that Europe will collapse due to a double crisis, namely (1) economic collapse and (2) the Balkanization of Europe. If it encounters these two crises, Europe will be easily swallowed up by aggression, so the United States of Europe must be organized.

### Marshal Voroshilov to Visit Budapest

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 11th] Marshal Voroshilov, Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Northern Road Army, recently led a Soviet delegation from here to Budapest to celebrate the centenary of the Hungarian Revolution. [Agence France-Presse, Budapest, 11th] Representatives of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party met yesterday and passed a resolution announcing the merger of the two labor parties, to be completed before July 1st this year. Prior to this date, each party will appoint five representatives to form a joint committee to handle all matters.

Foreign Ministers from Each Nation to Attend

[Reuters, Brussels, 11th] Belgian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Spaak is scheduled to personally lead the Belgian delegation to Paris next Monday to attend the sixteen-nation meeting on the Marshall Plan, which opens on Tuesday.

[Agence France-Presse, Copenhagen, 12th] The Foreign Ministers of Norway and Sweden arrived here on the 12th to hold consultations with the Danish Foreign Minister. The Foreign Ministers of the two countries will leave here on the 15th for Paris to attend the sixteen-nation meeting.

[Reuters, Paris, 11th] The special train of King Gustaf of Sweden arrived in Paris today and then departed for Nice in southern France at night. According to Swedish embassy officials, one of the carriages was detached when the train arrived in Germany due to a hot water pipe, leading some to believe that the Swedish King had died, hence the carriage was detached, and the rumors outside were likely due to this. According to a telegram from Stockholm, public and private buildings in the Swedish capital had already lowered their flags in mourning after learning of the rumor of Gustaf's sudden death, which was later formally denied by Crown Prince Adolf and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

### Former Czech Foreign Minister's State Funeral Today, People Look at His Remains with Tears

[Reported by Our Newspaper] London, 12th Broadcast: Prague, Czech Republic - The remains of the late Foreign Minister Masaryk were displayed at the Czernin Palace today. 10,000 workers, merchants, farmers, and their families lined up to pass by Masaryk's body, while another 100,000 people waited in the square. As they passed before the remains, they were silent and tearful, a scene of extreme solemnity and grief. [Associated Press, Prague, 11th] The Czech Foreign Ministry stated on the 11th that, in accordance with the special request of the late Foreign Minister Masaryk, only the Masaryk family gravesite in Lány will have a religious ceremony during the funeral on the 13th. A ceremony will be held at Wenceslas Square at 2:00 PM on the 13th, with the diplomatic corps of various countries and all cabinet members participating. Afterwards, they will march to the Czernin Palace, where the Foreign Ministry is located. However, in Lány, only members of the Masaryk family and government leaders will attend, and the religious ceremony will be presided over by Masaryk's family pastor.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 11th] The government announced tonight that Masaryk's remains were examined by Doctor Hájek yesterday, and it was determined that Masaryk's death was instantaneous. Masaryk's remains will be displayed in the corridor of the Foreign Ministry's Czernin Palace tomorrow. [United Press, Prague, 12th] The Communist Party today submitted a new reorganization and legislative plan to the parliament, intensifying its control over the entire Czech Republic. The party has already taken control of the two important committees of budget and foreign affairs. During today's parliamentary session, it is expected to proceed with organizing various committees, assigning important positions to the Communist Party, and recognizing the work of the various action committees as legal.

[Agence France-Presse, Oslo, 11th] The Czech ambassador to Norway, Walter, telegraphed the Czech Foreign Ministry, stating that he could no longer cooperate with the Czech authorities and had to resign.

### Large Numbers of Officials Arrested in Yugoslavia

Accused of Spying for Britain

[Reuters, Belgrade, 11th] Twenty important figures in the Yugoslav Communist Party and economic circles were arrested today. They are all important officials of the Slovenian government, and one is even an assistant to the Yugoslav Minister of Industry. They will soon be prosecuted on charges of infiltrating the Slovenian Communist Party before the war, using their positions to steal economic intelligence for Britain. Those arrested were detained in the Nazi Dachau concentration camp during the war and have always supported the policies of the Communist Party Central Committee, so their arrest is quite surprising.

### Austrian Communist Party Active

Preparing for a Full-Scale Offensive Against the Government

[United Press, Vienna, 11th] Observers here tonight expect the Austrian Communist Party to launch a full-scale offensive against the coalition government led by Figl. The government says that communist-controlled labor strikes will break out across Austria within the next week.

The original bill called for a total special tax collection of 130 billion francs, but this has been reduced to 118 billion francs after the amendment.

### The Constitution of England

— (Written by Aemilius of England, Translated by Pifu)

The constitution of England has never been written into a single document; rather, it is a living framework containing historical experience and accepted by tradition. Although it has undergone repeated development, it still retains many of its characteristics. The reason why the constitution can stand to this day is due to the retention of certain fundamental spirits within the constitution.

In fact, only two major principles determine the direction of the development of the English constitution: one is the "rule of law," and the other is the recognition that the central government is subject to the law but endowed with supreme power. England should thank William the Conqueror and his successors for giving it a strong centralized government earlier than any other country in Europe, and thus creating a significant divide between the King and his subjects, great and small. This divide united all British subjects, prevented the arbitrary exercise of royal power, and protected the established laws of the country. The Magna Carta in history is the most commendable page in its development, and its success was entirely due to the cooperation and agreement between the King and the people. The former represents the governing, commanding, and proactive aspect of the national life, while the latter becomes the protector of the national law.

The royal expenditures for Parliament—the place for reaching agreements—greatly increased its power's primary key. Often, during discussions and negotiations, reforms are promoted in other areas, or legal additions and deletions are made. Another development is also quite important: formerly, when Parliament was dissatisfied with the King's appointed servants, it often resorted to methods of interrogation or demotion, but now it has become a regular practice to make more moderate inquiries and criticisms of these cabinet ministers. Due to this development, coupled with the belief that the King cannot act arbitrarily, the King's personal position and his administrative power have been divided into two, thus forming the most important feature of the current British constitution.

Once an empire has removed the individual's autocratic power, it essentially gradually becomes a symbol of the empire's life, survival, and unity. It is through this process of power separation that the King can become the center of loyalty for the entire nation, making loyalty to the King surpass everything else. In a country as complex as England in terms of both political system and society, there is really no other satisfactory common center other than the King.

In fact, the British throne has always maintained the power of administration and guidance, and this power has not only not been weakened but has also been greatly enhanced. Consider the most important reform in the British constitution, which is the major event of selecting a group of people from the members of Parliament to be appointed as cabinet members. Its significance seems to put the King's policy under the party's policy, but on the other hand, the government has therefore gained a magic weapon to control Parliament, which is tantamount to turning several heads of Parliament into the King's housekeepers.

Because these cabinet members are from the members of Parliament, and they take being members of Parliament as their lifelong career, they can make Parliament the center and focus of national politics. The reason why British politics can maintain unity and harmony is entirely due to the personal relationship between Parliament and the government. No matter how much reform there is in the evolution of the constitution, the two major spirits of British politics have always maintained their brilliance, because we know that the British constitution is ultimately based on the government and the representatives of the people. In the constant consultation and contact in Parliament, the government represents the guiding and executing side, but it must obtain the consent of the people. To obtain the consent of the people, there must be lengthy deliberations in Parliament. Mr. Bagehot said it well: "The action and reaction between the cabinet and Parliament is the life of Britain." Today we can also say "between the cabinet and the opposition party," because most of the criticism work in Parliament has gradually been taken over by the opposition party.

The British constitution has never recognized voters as the original elements of political activity, allowing him to elect a representative to Parliament to express his opinion, or to choose an administrative organ that meets his wishes. It must be known that the starting point and driving force are always in the hands of the government. The activity of British political life is centered on the government. When it comes to the two-party system, we often think that it is a pleasant result accidentally obtained in the historical evolution, or that it is a natural result representing two different ideas. Both of these statements are reasonable, but it must be known that the tradition of British politics is government first, and the opinions of voters or members of Parliament are limited to choosing between agreeing or disagreeing. Under this tradition, the emergence of a two-party system is a natural reason. On closer examination, it must also be attributed to this tradition, which enables the government, which is gradually supported by the majority in Parliament, to obtain a certain degree of stability. Foreign constitution imitators often lose their way on this point. Their idea is to take a voter's representative, through the legislative process, to reach the administrative stage, as the entire concept of political power, and they believe that this concept can be united with the external structure of the constitution. Because of this concept, the voter's right to choose a political party is inevitably elevated, and the voter is made to recognize this as the ultimate goal, thus causing party divisions, and the government is no longer the master of Parliament, but becomes the tail of Parliament. The formation of dictatorship and bureaucracy is mostly due to only knowing how to imitate the shell of the British constitution, while ignoring its essence, ignoring the tradition that there must be a strong and stable government. In any case, any constitution that focuses on electing representatives is not the British constitution. The British system is a democratic system, a tacit democracy, not a democracy through elections or appointments. The British government is with the people, but it is not the people's, nor is it Parliament's. To borrow a grandiose phrase, it is the King in Parliament. (To be continued)

### Countries Take Precautionary Measures to Prevent Domestic Communist Activities

[United Press, London, 11th] The sudden death of Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk and other events in that country have caused repercussions in various European countries today. The Swiss Parliament passed a resolution condemning the Swiss Communist Party by a vote of 187 to 7 and called on the government to take precautionary action to defend the country. All parties except the Communist Party voted in favor, and the motion stated, "The past few weeks have shown the danger to democratic countries if they do not have the determination to prevent internal attacks."

In The Hague, Dutch Justice Minister Nyasiven stated that the government would announce the organization of special police within two days to curb extremist activities from all sides. The government has been preparing to form special police for some time, and the decision was made quickly due to the Czech coup.

In Paris, French Foreign Minister Bidault also delivered a speech in Parliament, mentioning the actions of the Communist Party in Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic in recent months. He said that such actions could not be agreed to by France. France will step up the organization of the rest of Europe, and the alliance treaty to be completed in Brussels by the five Western European countries is essential.

At the same time, several Czech ambassadors stationed abroad have resigned. Social Democratic Party member Novotny returned to China from India and said in Rome that he had resigned. The Communist Party's seizure of power this time had been prepared for a long time in advance. I will try to organize a group to help Czechs escape from this country.

In Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, King Frederick IX addressed the cheering crowd and said, "I am determined to protect Denmark as a free country with all my strength."

In Canberra, Australian opposition leader Menzies said that the Liberal Party he leads would propose and support a complete ban on the Australian Communist Party and all other groups that have communist goals and means or are controlled by the Communist Party. Prime Minister Chifley had previously opposed this move.

### Bidault's Report on Diplomacy Supported by Parliament

[Reuters, Paris, 11th] Foreign Minister Bidault reported on foreign policy in the National Assembly today, winning the support of all members except the Communist Party. Bidault said: "Recent developments in every country in Eastern Europe are very similar, and the nature of these developments makes people feel uncomfortable. The time has come for Western European countries to form an alliance. We must unite on the basis of the principles of freedom." When discussing the Greek problem, Bidault said that although the Greek government has shortcomings, there cannot be perfect governments in free countries at all. The Greek government was indeed a government produced by free elections held under international supervision. Referring to the Franco-Italian customs union, he said that negotiations were continuing and no agreement had been reached. Bidault, in response to criticisms about the organization of the Western European bloc, specifically listed fifteen mutual assistance treaties signed between Eastern European countries from 1943 to 1948. He said that Europe has the right to do what has already been done elsewhere. Members, except for the Communist Party, then passed the government's foreign policy with a majority of 236 votes and raised their hands to pay tribute to Masaryk.

### Korean Committee Resolves to Monitor South Korean Elections

The US Occupation Authorities Should Be Reorganized

[Associated Press, Seoul, 12th] The United Nations Special Committee on Korea voted four to one on the 12th to monitor the South Korean elections on May 9th. The US occupation authorities should implement some reorganization to ensure an atmosphere of freedom. Canada and Australia voted against, and France and Syria abstained.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] Syngman Rhee, representing the South Korean Democratic Unification Headquarters, sent a letter to the United Nations Korean Committee today, expressing his support for holding a general election. The letter stated: "The Democratic Unification Headquarters is composed of 70 political parties and groups, and unanimously supports the general election, because it believes that the general election is very necessary at present, and asks the Korean Committee to convene representatives of various political parties and groups to directly solicit opinions on the general election."

### US Policy of Fostering the Japanese Economy Will Revive Japanese Imperialism China, India, and the Philippines Vigorously Attack This

[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th, Associated Press] Well-informed sources said: As Eastern countries in the Far Eastern Commission, they have vigorously attacked the US policy of fostering the Japanese economy and issued warnings that the Americans are laying the foundation for the revival of Japanese imperialism. It is said that in the work of the steering committee of the Far Eastern Commission, and in talks with American officials, representatives of the Eastern countries have protested against the US suggestions, made last year by the State Department and the Army-Navy Liaison Committee, regarding the permanent level of Japanese industry. According to the above suggestions, they are still under discussion in the Far Eastern Commission.

Well-informed sources continued: The Eastern countries are especially worried that the US may even relax the suggested level of Japanese industry further, according to the recently published Strike Report. The Chinese representative to the Far Eastern Commission has been the leader in attacking the US for this attitude to the level of Japanese industry. The Chinese representative has expressed his country's views on this matter in the steering committee. And the Indian and Philippine representatives have also stated that they are not satisfied with the US's ability to do this. The suggestions that the US is currently making in the steering committee of the Far Eastern Commission will allow the following levels for Japan's main industries: an annual production of two million tons of pig iron, three million five hundred thousand tons of steel ingots, two million five hundred thousand tons of steel plates, two hundred and fifty thousand machine tools, and ball bearings worth three thousand two hundred and fifty million yen. In addition, it will be allowed to build 150,000 tons of ships per year, maintain ship repair equipment of 10,000 tons, and maintain a merchant fleet of two million tons. But the US has stated that in order for Japan to be self-sufficient by 1953, these levels will need to be increased. Because various countries are currently opposing the US's attitude towards the level of Japanese industry in the steering committee, today's weekly meeting of the Far Eastern Commission had no progress on its agenda. Today's meeting discussed the US's suggestion to allow Japanese to attend international conferences for consultation. The representatives of China and India firmly opposed allowing Japanese to go abroad to participate in intergovernmental meetings with various countries' governments. The remaining representatives of the participating countries believed that each proposal should be weighed for its advantages and disadvantages and decided accordingly, and should not be blindly passed. The Soviet Union has not stated its position on all of the US's suggestions regarding Japanese industrial issues.

### Four Powers Reconvene to Discuss the Holy Land Problem The Soviet Union Suddenly Refuses to Participate The Security Council's Suggestions Have Apparently Failed

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 11th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko today threatened to refuse to participate in discussions with various countries on Palestine. Gromyko opposed countries directly negotiating any method to calm the dispute between the Arabs and Jews. The Soviet Union's warning was issued when the Security Council invited the chief representatives of China, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union to continue informal discussions on the Palestinian problem.

[Reuters, New York, 11th] In today's four-power Palestine conference, Soviet representative Gromyko solemnly refused to seek further opinions on the Palestine issue from the Jewish and Arab people, saying that the Soviet Union's position on the partition plan was extremely clear and would not allow any change. US representative Austin asked Gromyko to be flexible, but Gromyko replied, "I'm sorry, Russians never change their minds." Austin then said: "Then this meeting may inevitably fail." Gromyko did not answer, but only shrugged his shoulders. Austin then asked British representative Cadogan whether Britain could revise its timetable for withdrawing from Palestine if the Jewish and Arab sides could agree to some solution, but Cadogan replied: He could not answer "yes." Austin then asked if his intention was "no"? Cadogan replied: The withdrawal date has already been decided, and he has not received other instructions, but he also stated that British Colonial Secretary Jones recently stated that Britain would welcome any effort to find a bridge between the Jewish and Arab people, and this statement still applies today.

### Truman Asks Congress to Allocate Funds for Temporary Aid to France, Italy, and Austria Needs $55 Million to Purchase Goods

[Reuters, Washington, 11th] President Truman today asked Congress to continue allocating $55 million to help Western Europe get through the period before the European Recovery Program is implemented, in order to order the goods necessary for the transition period. The president stressed that this amount is only needed to assist a very short transitional period extension, as Congress passed the transitional aid bill for France, Italy, and Austria last autumn, originally hoping to maintain it until the Marshall Plan was implemented, but judging from current signs, the transitional aid seems to be used up before the Marshall Plan is implemented, so transitional aid must be increased. In Truman's letter to House Speaker Martin, he strongly stated that the events in Europe in recent weeks do not allow the United States to risk cutting off supplies at this time, so he hopes that Congress can continue to allocate the funds needed for the transitional period before April 1st.

### Rice Supply Improves More Than 1,900 Resale Points Will Have Rice Delivered by Tonight at the Latest

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Recently, citizens have been very crowded to buy rationed rice due to soaring rice prices. Warehouses have been unable to ship goods in time, and rice shops have been unable to distribute enough, resulting in people having to travel back and forth in vain. Rice shops that have rice for sale have lines of people queuing up to buy first, and the order is not good. The authorities are paying close attention to this and are working hard to improve it. Ren [Name], Chairman of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, visited Ruan Guangming, Director of the Administrative Office of the Police Bureau, yesterday to discuss asking the branch bureaus to assist in strengthening the supervision of the district intermediary warehouses to increase rice shipments. As for the allocation of rice to foreigners in the city, the Allocation Committee has started issuing certificates from yesterday.

[Another report] The Civil Food Allocation Committee announced that the rice shipment situation from various warehouses yesterday was good, and the most satisfactory was the First Warehouse of the China Trust Bureau. All the rice stored in the warehouse was completely shipped out yesterday. The East Warehouse and Lanlu Warehouse shipped rice overnight, and the rice stored in each warehouse can be shipped out today. The Gongyi and Taikoo warehouses each shipped 10,000 bags, and more can be shipped out today. In addition, the Yong'an Warehouse has been added as a distribution point for rationed rice. Taikoo Village will start meeting at 7:00 AM starting today, and the Customs will also send personnel to take turns. The foremen of each warehouse have also added porters. The 1,935 rice shops, district cooperatives, and social service centers throughout the city can have rationed rice delivered by tonight at the latest. Yesterday afternoon, each rice shop posted advertisements that the rationed rice had arrived, which was convenient for the citizens. In addition, since the China Trust Bureau started distributing rice on February 29th, the staff at all levels have indeed worked hard and there have been no delays. However, it is also a fact that the coordination of the Civil Food Allocation Committee's rice shops and vehicles has not been adequate, and improvements are being sought.

### Police Officers, Road Workers, and Street Cleaners to Receive an Additional Two Dou of Low-Priced Rice

The Principle Has Been Determined and Will Be Implemented This Month

In view of the recent high prices and the fact that the living standards of general public education and treatment personnel are difficult to maintain, and the income of police officers, street cleaners, and road workers is even more meager, the city government authorities have decided to first request the Civil Food Allocation Committee to increase the allocation of low-priced rice by two dou per month in order to achieve reasonable improvement. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited Shen Zonglian, Secretary-General of the City Government, and asked about the results. Shen said: "At present, prices are soaring and the lives of civil servants are indeed difficult. The government hopes to improve them reasonably at all times. However, the Shanghai City Government is a local institution and can only follow the regulations of the central government in everything. Therefore, we can only help the poorest police officers, street cleaners, and road workers first, and request the Civil Food Allocation Committee to increase the allocation of rice by two dou. The principle has been approved, and the price of each dou is tentatively set at 80,000 yuan, which can be implemented this month. We hope that they can work with peace of mind as soon as possible."

### Public Auction of Some Materials from the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA)

### Continuous Heavy Fog Disrupts Air and Sea Navigation

[Report from our newspaper] Due to recent severe weather and heavy fog, navigation has been difficult, causing slight delays in the arrival and departure of ships. The Shanghai-Ningbo line Jiangjing Wheel was supposed to arrive in Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday, but had not been seen entering port by evening. The Jiangjin and Jiangyun Wheels, which were supposed to come to Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday, also had no news of leaving Ningbo by evening. Therefore, whether the ships sailing to Ningbo today can depart as scheduled is still uncertain. In addition, both China and Central Airlines have announced the suspension of flights on the Shanghai-Beijing and Shanghai-Chongqing routes for northern and central China, as the weather in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Yellow River basin is exceptionally severe, and high-altitude "visibility" is extremely low, greatly affecting flight safety. Only the South China routes continue to operate as normal.

### Smuggled Goods Seized in the Coal Bunker of a British Ship Arriving from Hong Kong

According to the Jianghai Customs, on the 6th of this month, the British ship S/S Alipur arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong. Upon arrival at the Wusongkou port, the Jianghai Customs, based on a confidential report, dispatched investigators in advance to intercept the ship. As a result of boarding and searching, smuggled goods were found hidden in the coal bunker on the port side, in the space behind the iron wall separating the large steam pipe above the boiler. The smuggled goods included dozens of items such as cigarette paper, steel files, belt buckles, shoe polish, playing cards, and Western medicine, with a total value of approximately 500 million yuan. The goods were immediately seized and handled according to regulations.

### Two Foreign Merchants Arrested for Operating in the Black Market for Gold and Currency; The Scale is Comparable to the Mesber Case

The Economic Section of the Investigation Department of the Songhu Garrison Command has recently uncovered an organization run by foreign merchants involved in the black market for gold and currency. The scale of the case is comparable to the "Foreign Tiger" Mesber case uncovered by the department last spring. The main culprit in this case is a citizen of a certain country, who has now been apprehended. Zheng Zhongwei, the director of the Investigation Department, Zhang Yangmin, the deputy director, and Zhang Yamin, the chief of the Economic Section, received a confidential report at the end of last month, learning that a large-scale gold and currency black market organization was operating in a certain building in the city, and the person in charge was a certain foreign merchant. At that time, because the case involved foreign affairs, it was not convenient to launch an immediate operation. To avoid alarming the suspects, they remained low-key. Zhang, the chief of the Economic Section, dispatched Chen Mo, the leader of the Economic Group, leading a large number of officers, disguised as customers, to infiltrate the premises, investigate the situation, and monitor the suspects' actions. On the 7th of this month, after confirming that the operation was indeed a private gold and currency black market, they immediately reported to Commander Xuan and obtained his approval to proceed to the location together with the financial management authorities. Two foreign merchants, Qinsheng and Ketesiji, the main culprits, were captured on the spot, along with a number of accomplices. A large number of gold and currency transaction ledgers were also seized. All the suspects are currently detained at the Garrison Command and will be transferred to the court for interrogation within a few days. All files and gold currency were sent to the Financial Management Bureau yesterday for safekeeping.

### Two Customs Officers Sentenced for Accepting Bribes in the Hanyang Wheel Case

[Report from our newspaper] Yang Zhicai and Jin Qingliang, investigators from the Jianghai Customs, were sentenced yesterday to ten years of imprisonment by the local court for accepting bribes and dereliction of duty for personal gain. The cook Xin Afu was deemed not to be a civil servant and therefore could not be tried in criminal court, and the prosecutor was instructed to conduct a separate investigation. According to the case, on January 7th of this year, Yang and Jin were searching for smuggled goods on the Hanyang Wheel, which had arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong. They discovered 31 gold bars of various sizes in the engine room of Xin Afu, the cook. They should have reported it to the customs for confiscation, but Yang and Jin accepted bribes of nine gold bars from the owner, Wu Guo, and let him go. Later, they regretted it and reported the incident to the customs, leading to the arrest of Yang, Jin, and Xin, and their transfer to the court for trial.

### Homicide on Shandong Road; Wife of a Worker at the Xinwen Bao Newspaper Strangled; The Murderer Was an Acquaintance and is at Large; Search Underway

[Report from our newspaper] Wu Dalin, 52, the wife of Fang Jinyuan, 50, a worker in the lead plate room of the Xinwen Bao at 264 Shandong Road, 3rd floor, was tragically strangled to death by a young man named Zhang Xiaoshan (nicknamed "Little Pudong," around 20 years old) at around 3:30 p.m. yesterday while she was alone at home. The victim and the murderer were acquaintances. In 1934, when Fang was responsible for the meals at the Xinwen Bao's colleagues' cooperative, a caterer from a place on Shanxi Road introduced Zhang Xiaoshan to Fang's service. After less than two months, he was dismissed. Later, Zhang often came to Fang's residence to chat. Fang had no children of his own but had an adopted daughter named Juzhen. Zhang admired her and expressed his desire to marry her, but Wu refused. Last year, the daughter married Zhang Kentang, a fellow worker at the newspaper, and Xiaoshan harbored a grudge. Recently, he had asked Fang for a loan of 200,000 yuan, but Fang only lent him 40,000 yuan, causing him to be dissatisfied. For the past week, he had been lingering at Fang's home, discovering that Fang always went to the City Temple to listen to stories after lunch. Fang had a nephew named Xuanlu, only eleven years old, who had come to Shanghai from his hometown less than two years ago and was currently studying at the newspaper's labor union children's school. Therefore, only Wu was left alone at home every afternoon. Yesterday afternoon, Zhang Xiaoshan went upstairs alone. Seeing Wu, he took out a hemp rope, looped it around her neck, and dragged her to the floor, stepping on her abdomen with both feet for more than ten minutes until she suffocated and died. Xuanlu, his nephew, returned home from school and witnessed Zhang Xiaoshan pressing down on his aunt. Not knowing what was happening, he mistakenly thought they were fighting and repeatedly called out, "Don't do this, let's talk things over!" Zhang replied, "Your mother hit me first, so I'm hitting her." He said he was extremely thirsty and ordered the child to pour a cup of tea. Xuanlu poured boiling water from the hot water bottle and handed it to Xiaoshan. At that time, both of Wu's hands had a gold ring. One ring on her right hand had already been robbed. Just as he was about to rob the gold ring on her left hand, he was seen by Xuanlu, who shouted "No!". Zhang knew he had been exposed, so he ran downstairs and fled. Xuanlu then went forward and called "Auntie" three times, but she could not be revived. He turned back and chased after him, but Zhang had disappeared. He ran to tell Cao Yumei, the pancake vendor at the entrance of the alley, and then went to the newspaper to call for help. Fang's colleagues arrived one after another to investigate and found that she had died tragically. A gold earring and gold chain were still on her neck. They immediately reported to the City Police Bureau and the Huangpu Branch Bureau. Kou Junhou, the chief of the Criminal Investigation Section of the General Bureau, arrived first with his staff, took photos of the deceased, and then Li Yinmin, the head of the Criminal Division of the Huangpu Branch Bureau, led his officers, Ren Fengwu, etc., to investigate the details of the victim. They immediately sent out detectives to search for the murderer. It is reported that Zhang Xiaoshan had a "flyer" haircut and was wearing a blue cloth shirt and trousers when he escaped. The body was sent to Renji Hospital and then transferred to the Changde Road autopsy room for examination.

### Police Bureau Accepts Migration Registration; Director Yu Explains the Truth

[Report from our newspaper] Recently, the central government stipulated that the police bureau will handle household migration registration. The outside world does not understand the truth and believes that the civil affairs bureau's household administration work will be handled by the police bureau. The council even requested the central government to withdraw its order, and the rumors varied. Director Yu of the Police Bureau made a special statement on this matter yesterday: The fact that this bureau will handle citizen migration and flow registration is in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Interior forwarded by the municipal government regarding the police and household administration agencies' investigation and reporting of household matters. Only the two items of moving in and moving out in the household registration law and household registration will be handled by the police agency during the period of suppression of rebellion in order to control changes and ensure social order. It is not the case that all household administration work will be handed over to the police bureau. Furthermore, the materials for migration registration handled by this bureau and various branch bureaus must still be sent to the civil affairs bureau and district offices for legal registration. It is purely a matter of using the police's manpower to assist the civil affairs bureau in promoting household administration work. There is no conflict between the work of the two parties. In addition, various simplified procedures have been established, such as citizens being able to use mail to handle move-in registration, or citizens can make their own appointments for re-inspection. These are simpler than the current registration methods stipulated by the Ministry of Interior. This matter concerns the safety and security of the city's citizens, and it is hoped that all sectors of society will continue to cooperate with the bureau's work with the same enthusiasm as in the past.

### The Capital District Prosecutor's Office Prosecutes Police Officers in the Jin Du Case

[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing, 12th] Eleven people, including Zhao Qingdou, director of the Xincheng Police Branch Bureau, were prosecuted on the 12th by the Capital District Court in connection with the Jin Du bloodbath in Shanghai on July 27th of last year. The case was originally reviewed by the Military Law Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense. The part involving the military police has been adjudicated and executed. The police part was transferred by the Military Law Bureau to the Capital District Court for trial on December 15. After several months of investigation, the prosecutor's office filed a public prosecution. After describing the Jin Du massacre in the indictment, it pointed out that the defendant Zhuo Qingdou, as a police officer, failed to fulfill his defense responsibilities during the conflict and violated Article 130 of the Criminal Code. The defendants Li Tianjie, Mei Zhuoliang, Li Binchen, Xu Jianping, Zhang Xiangchen, Yang Xunzhang, Zhang Yinzhi, Liang Ruyuan, Jia Rongzhen, and Zeng Guangzhi violated the latter part of Article 150 of the Criminal Code. A public prosecution was filed in accordance with Article 230 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

### Conference on the Manufacture of Textile Machinery; Discussions in Three Groups Today; Plans to Build 200,000 Spindles and 7,000 Looms

[Report from our newspaper] The Conference on the Manufacture of Textile Machinery organized by the Ministry of Economic Affairs was inaugurated at 10 a.m. yesterday in the conference room of the National Textile Industry Federation. The meeting was personally chaired by Chen Qitian, Minister of Economic Affairs, and attended by over forty people, including responsible persons from relevant government departments and textile and manufacturing experts. Minister Chen delivered the opening speech, stating that the Ministry of Economic Affairs attaches great importance to the textile industry and is determined to fully support its development.

### On the Issue of Purchasing Taiwanese Coal and Depreciation, the Fuel Management Committee Explains Two Points: The Price of Coal Distributed to Public Utilities is Lower Than the Cost; Depreciation During Transportation Was Agreed Upon and Not a Corrupt Practice

[Central News Agency] Regarding the two points made by Vice Chairman Sun in his speech on the 7th of this month, "The Ministry of Economic Affairs purchases He Coal at 1,500,000 yuan per ton of legal tender and sells it at several times this price," and in the recent report of the Control Yuan, "The habit of dock workers unloading coal in Shanghai results in a depreciation of 20/1000, which is a long-standing corrupt practice that cannot be eliminated in a short time. The actual amount of depreciation is not that great, and most of this coal enters the black market and is sold at inflated prices," the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs issued the following statement yesterday:

Setting Distribution Prices Based on Needs

All coal produced in Taiwan, in addition to supplying various public and private uses in the province, is purchased and transported to Shanghai for distribution by the Provincial Coal Adjustment Committee and this committee. The purchase price is the same as the price of Kailuan coal delivered on board ships in Qinhuangdao. However, in terms of coal quality, Taiwanese coal is inferior to Kailuan coal, so the actual price of Taiwanese coal is higher than that of Kailuan coal. This committee adds transportation costs, insurance fees, shortages, and loading and unloading costs in Shanghai to the purchase price to arrive at the actual cost of purchasing the coal. Based on this cost, distribution prices are set separately based on public and private needs. Because the price of coal distributed by this committee to public utilities in Shanghai is still lower than the purchase cost, resulting in a large loss, it is necessary to slightly increase the price of coal distributed to other factories in order to make up for the loss.

Selling at High Prices is Not the Case

Vice Chairman Sun's statement that "purchasing at 1,500,000 yuan per ton of legal tender" likely refers to the coal price in January of this year. In fact, the purchase price of this committee in Taiwan in January was 1,530,000 yuan per ton, plus transportation costs of 450,000 yuan, ship delay fees of 67,500 yuan, pilot and dock fees of 46,800 yuan, insurance fees of 18,200 yuan, shortages of 64,000 yuan, and Shanghai dock fees (including loading and unloading, warehouse rent, dock equipment management fees, etc.) of 213,200 yuan, totaling 2,389,700 yuan per ton. The distribution price to public utilities in Shanghai was 2,180,000 yuan per ton, and the price to factories was 3,140,000 yuan. As for railways, military supplies, sea transport, harbor dredging, power plants in other cities, and various agencies under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, they were all distributed at the purchase cost, and there was no selling at several times the price.

98% Delivery after Coal Unloading

Regarding the 41st point of the key points of the report on government economic measures in North China, published by the Control Yuan's delegates Yu Shude, Miao Peicheng, and Li Xiaoting, "The habit of dock workers unloading coal results in a depreciation of 20/1000, which is a long-standing corrupt practice that cannot be eliminated in a short time. The actual amount of depreciation is not that great, and most of this coal enters the black market and is sold at inflated prices," is slightly inconsistent with the facts. Shanghai coal users usually entrust the transportation of coal from the committee's warehouse or other dock warehouses to the factory to transportation companies. From the ship unloading at the Pudong warehouse to the landing at the Puxi dock, and then transported to the factory by truck, the losses during the whole transportation are usually contracted to the transportation companies, who agree with the factory on delivering at 99% or 98% of the coal amount depending on the distance. This method was originally to compensate for the actual losses during transportation, and it was agreed upon by both parties. There is no so-called 20/1000 corrupt practice.

### The Case of Air Freight Price Gouging: Allegations that China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Ticket Office Director and Others Under Investigation for Ticket Sales and Transport Irregularities

### Tree Planting Day Commemorative Meeting Held at Zhongshan Park, Representatives from All Sectors Plant 200 Trees

[Report from This Newspaper] The 37th Annual Tree Planting Day Commemorative Meeting of all sectors of the city was held at the Zhongshan Park Concert Hall at 3:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included City Government Secretary-General Shen Zongtan, Police Chief Yu Shuping, Social Affairs Bureau representative Wang Jiashu, Municipal Farmers' Association representative Lin, Municipal Women's Association representative Qian Jianqiu, as well as students from Yucai and Municipal West schools, and hundreds of citizens. After the Municipal Children's Education Center band played music, Chairman Shen, the Secretary-General, delivered a speech, explaining the significance of Tree Planting Day. He stated that Sun Yat-sen's creation of China was like cultivating trees, and today it has gradually grown. National reconstruction requires pillars of support, and as we commemorate the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death today, we must continue to work hard, and so on. Following Wan Molin's speech, Secretary-General Shen, representing Mayor Wu, planted the first tree beside the main road in the botanical garden. Leaders from various municipal agencies, prominent social figures, and organizations also planted a tree each, totaling 200 trees.

Director Zhao Calls for Greening of Shanghai

Furthermore, Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zukang, and Zhu Guoxi, the bureau's structural division chief, went to the Gaoqiao seaside at 1:00 PM yesterday to personally plant trees. The trees were of two types: weeping willows and willow trees. It was decided that 15,000 trees will be planted along the Gaoqiao seawall this year, with Director Zhao planting the first weeping willow yesterday. Mr. Zhao also proclaimed the slogan "Greening Shanghai" on Tree Planting Day, declaring that efforts must be made to ensure that Shanghai has parks, street trees, and plazas everywhere. "Greening Shanghai" does not cost much money and is of great practical benefit, making it "economical and practical." Mr. Zhao then reported on the progress of the bureau's landscaping work over the past year, briefly stating that the city has more than 20,000 street trees. In addition, Zhongshan Park Botanical Garden has 407 species of famous trees, totaling more than 1,500 trees. The total number of trees in the city's parks is approximately 10,000. This year, on Tree Planting Day, we are planting trees on the seawall, hoping to enhance the beauty of Gaoqiao and to achieve the effect of protecting the seawall.

Beautifying and Protecting the Seawall

Subsequently, Zhu Guoxi, the chief of the structural division, reported on the construction and repair of the seawall, stating that the Public Works Bureau has been actively repairing it for the past two years, and the major gaps have been gradually repaired. A total of more than 5.7 billion yuan has been spent, of which 1.3 billion yuan was allocated by the Executive Yuan. Now that the safety problem of the Gaoqiao seawall has been resolved, the Public Works Bureau's second step will focus on two points: (1) Beautifying the seawall: making it as beautiful as possible for public appreciation. (2) Protecting the seawall: in the past, the seawall embankment was protected, but in the future, the seawall beach will be protected. Chief Zhu continued by saying that planting trees can increase the soil's cohesion and reduce seawater erosion, which can effectively protect the seawall.

Planting Trees by the Seaside in Misty Rain

The Public Works Bureau specially prepared a "Tree Planting Bus," which departed at about 1:00 PM for the Luzupu Rutgers Crossing pier in Rongpu, and crossed the river by truck. The bus arrived at the seaside at about 2:00 PM, when it was drizzling, and the seawall was shrouded in mist. The local gardeners had already dug holes at fixed intervals in the soil. Director Zhao and his party, with smiles on their faces, placed the willow trees into the holes, and then covered them with mud. After the gardeners watered them, the tree planting was completed. The bus then drove along the seawall to inspect the construction and repair work, and returned to Shanghai at 5:00 PM.

### One Bowl of Poisoned Noodles Kills Husband: Three Defendants Indicted for Conspiracy to Murder

[Report from This Newspaper] The case of Wang Zhengsheng, Yang Miaoguiying, and Yuan Jincai being accused of murder was prosecuted by the District Attorney's Office yesterday. Wang Zhengsheng worked as a chef in the kitchen of the No. 15 Cotton Textile Factory in Qiqihar Road, and the female worker Yang Miaoguiying packed meals in the common kitchen. They had an affair, and Yang Miaoguiying had a poor relationship with her husband, Yang Haishu, so they conspired to harm him. On January 6 of this year, Wang asked Yuan Jincai, a cart driver in the workshop, to buy red arsenic and put it in the noodles. Yang ate the noodles and felt abdominal pain when she returned home, and died of poisoning on the 10th. The Yangshupu Police Station transported the body to the autopsy center on Changde Road for examination. The examination confirmed that she had been poisoned. After the prosecutor's investigation, the above three defendants were indicted on suspicion of conspiracy to murder.

### Owner of Yue Opera Theater Commits Suicide Due to Economic Pressure

[Report from This Newspaper] Yu Xingen, the backstage owner of the Cathay and Empire Yue Opera Theaters, (residence) No. 14 Ximen Lane, Simen Road. At 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, his wife saw that Yu had not yet gotten up and thought he was just sleeping in. She went to the room to urge him to get up, but found him unconscious. She was shocked and immediately flew to Nanyang Hospital, where it was found that Yu had taken poison. Due to prolonged poisoning, there was no way to save him. He died at 4:10 PM. Afterward, the Huashan Road Police Station sent personnel to investigate, and no traces of poisoning were found. The body has now been sent to Tongren Fuyuantang, awaiting inspection by the court. It is reported that Yu Xingen's sudden suicide was due to the sluggish business of the Cathay and Empire theaters, as well as the high contract fees and the sharp increase in venue and performance expenses, resulting in insufficient revenue to cover expenses. Yu owed high-interest loans, accumulating a large debt and lacking the ability to turn the situation around, leading him to resort to this desperate measure.

### Current Status of the West Section Restoration Project After the Opening of the Hangzhou-Southern Section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway

[Report from Our Nanchang Correspondent, 10th] After the opening of the Hangzhou-Southern section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the restoration project of the western section has gained more attention from the public. The director of the railway bureau, Hou Jiayuan, previously held an expedited work meeting in Nanchang and decided that the Nanchang to Pingxiang section of the project would be completed by the end of June this year. However, those responsible for track laying and bridge construction believe that the time is short and that the work must be expedited even more. The focus of the problem is still on funding and materials. For example, the steel beams urgently needed for the Zhangshu Ganjiang Bridge, the only large-scale project on the entire line, are still on order from Canada. It is feared that the contracting factory will not be able to deliver this batch of materials at all, because the steel beams for the Liangjiadu Bridge were also ordered from Canada, with the scheduled delivery time being June of last year. However, the steel beams currently used for the Liangjiadu Bridge were in fact pieced together. If the railway bureau or the Ministry of Transportation does not come up with another solution for the materials for the Ganjiang Bridge, this "expedited work" will likely become a problem. Currently, the earthwork project for the roadbed of the Nanchang to Pingxiang section is being carried out in segments. If the steel rails can arrive on schedule, the engineering department plans to start laying the tracks segment by segment from Zhangshu to the east and west. If there are no major obstacles in terms of weather and materials, the track laying project may be completed by the end of June this year, and the opening of the Nanchang to Pingxiang section will depend on the progress of the bridge construction. This reporter departed from Nanchang on the morning of the 4th to visit the Ganjiang Bridge project in Zhangshu and interview Ouyang Cheng, the chief of the third bridge engineering office responsible for the railway, and here is a recorded report on the progress of the five major bridge projects from Nanchang to Pingxiang.

The five major bridges managed by the third bridge engineering office are: Jiaxi Bridge in Nanchang County, Shanqian Bridge on the border of Nanchang and Fengcheng, Ganjiang Bridge in Zhangshu, Ganjiang tributary bridge, and Yuanshui Bridge between Yichun and Pingxiang.

The total length of the creek is 110 meters, divided into ten spans. Except for the steel beams salvaged from the riverbed of the original bridge pier, the remaining steel beams are all old materials from the Shanqian Bridge. Construction started on March 15 of last year, and now 90% of the entire project has been completed. It is expected that it will be fully completed around the 10th of this month.

Shanqian is 44 kilometers from Nanchang, and the bridge crosses the Shanqian River. Crossing from the north bank to the south bank enters Cheng County. A large highway bridge is less than 500 meters downstream from the railway bridge. Construction of this bridge also started on March 20 of last year. By the end of last year, more than 54 tons of salvaged steel beams and rail remnants had been salvaged. The bridge is 176 meters long, and the progress of the project was that the lower part of the project was completed by the end of last year, accounting for 53.5%, and the entire bridge project accounted for 49.9%. This sixteen-span reinforced concrete pier frame bridge is considered a very economical type of project to build a bridge over a small river. There are also quite a few bridges of this type along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. This bridge is 176 meters long and is the second largest project in the third district, second only to the Ganjiang and Yuanshui bridges. Eleven spans of the sixteen spans of the "Shanqian" bridge are prepared to use the materials salvaged from the Ganjiang Bridge, which can be barely dealt with by patching together. There are still five spans of steel beams that have not been settled, and it is possible to hope that the Ministry of Transportation will allocate a part of the British military steel beams. The lower part of the Shanqian Bridge was completed by the end of last year, accounting for 53.5%, and the entire bridge project was 49.9%. The entire project is now scheduled to be completed by the end of this month. The Ganjiang Bridge is the Zhangshu Bridge. One is across the main stream of the Ganjiang River, and the other is separated from the main stream bridge by a

small sandbar, so it is called the Ganjiang tributary bridge. The Ganjiang main stream bridge project is the only large bridge on the entire Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line, with a total length of 549 meters, divided into nine spans, each 60 meters long. During the wartime destruction, there was a locomotive with 25 different types of freight car boxes, in the middle of the bridge. Along with the explosion of the explosives, they fell into the depths of the riverbed, so the reconstruction project, the salvage work, because several years have passed, the car boxes lying at the bottom of the river, steel rails and wartime obstacles, were buried and washed away by sand, some only showed a trace, and some moved their positions. The engineering department estimates that it is necessary to salvage the damaged materials for Yong. There are 2,560 tons of materials in the riverbed of the Ganjiang Bridge. In order to smoothly carry out the salvage work, they cooperated with the Navy Department and asked the Navy to send a part of the salvage personnel to assist in the operation, and hired a batch of "water ghosts" from other places to work underwater. Participate in underwater work

There are now three groups of water ghosts, five people in each group. Regardless of the cold winter rain and snow, they wear a set of rubber waterproof clothing, with an airtight copper hat on their heads, and detect the location and shape of the damaged materials underwater. The land engineering personnel draw salvage blueprints and formulate salvage plans based on their underwater work reports. The work of the "water ghosts" is arduous, but the wages are also quite high. According to the engineering department, the daily wage of each group of five people is 4 million yuan. According to the "water ghosts" report, the salvage project of the Ganjiang Bridge currently has the following positions of the 25 car boxes lying at the bottom of the water: there are four in the third span, six in the fourth span, five in the fifth span, four in the sixth span, two in the seventh span, four in the eighth span, and a locomotive. Nine of them have been salvaged. As of January of this year, the salvage record of the Ganjiang Bridge is: The salvage of the steel beams in the second span is 70%, the fourth span is 46.7%, the fifth span is 48%, and the seventh span is 15%, totaling 95.5 tons of old steel beams salvaged, accounting for 37% of the total. Now the Ganjiang Bridge project has completed 56.5% of the lower part, and the entire bridge has completed 28.8%. The Ganjiang tributary bridge has a total length of 142.9 meters, with four spans, each 39 meters long. Construction started on March 10 of last year, and by the end of the year, the second pier of the large caisson waterproof was completed, one pumping was completed, and 593 cubic meters of damaged concrete were cleared and chiseled from each pier base. 3,400 cubic meters of foundation soil were excavated. In addition to the east and west seats, all were raised above

flood level and the first, third, and second piers were completed, regulating the completion of 50.3% of the lower building project of the entire bridge. The Yuanshui Bridge is the last large bridge in the western section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, with a total length of 180 meters, divided into seven spans, each span 25 meters wide. Construction started on April 16 of last year, and by the end of the year, the salvage of all the steel had been completed, with an actual weight of 37.8 tons. As of January, the pumping projects for the fourth and fifth piers had been completed in order, accounting for 14.3% of the total pumping and waterproofing projects. 394.75 cubic meters of damaged concrete were cleared, and 108 cubic meters of foundation soil were excavated. All the clearing and excavation projects were completed. 283 cubic meters of concrete were poured for the first, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth piers, accounting for 14.6% of the total pouring project. At the end of January, 56.02% of the lower part of the entire bridge had been completed. Five spans of the steel beams required for the entire building have been transported to Zhuzhou, and two spans are still in Hangzhou. Based on the current work theory, the Yuanshui Bridge can be completed as scheduled by June. Last year, the third district of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway completed 26.12%. As of the end of February, 42% of the entire project of the above five bridges had been completed. If the track laying project can be completed by the end of June, then if the Ganjiang Bridge project cannot be completed temporarily, the railway bureau is now preparing a plan to possibly use ferries.

### The Aerial Overlord Lands on the Soil of Yangon

[Report from Our Yangon Correspondent, 10th] The Aerial Overlord landed on the steel-boned runway of the Yangon Airport in the glow of the setting sun, like falling into the furnace of the universe. The hot air swept over the body from all around, making people feel suffocated. Staying in a hotel at night, mosquitoes flew outside the tent, and the electric fan whirred incessantly overhead all night. Although the sweating stopped, the heart was still irritable and uneasy. This season, the golden days of lush grass are flying in Jiangnan; in Yangon, it is climbing towards the peak of the temperature record. Yangon is near the sea, but the sea breeze cannot be blown, so it is not only hot, but also stuffy; not only stuffy, but also humid. These few days are generally above 儿十 degrees at noon, and the hottest days are still to come.

The Price of the Rupee

The tired body was liberated from the cold bath, but was immediately shocked by the high prices. When we handed the clothes we took off to the Indian waiter to wash, he told us: the washing fee for a shirt is two rupees, and the washing fee for underwear is one rupee. What is the ratio of the rupee to the national currency? In Yangon, foreign currency can be said to be completely non-existent. Even the US dollar, which is popular everywhere, is like a hero's end here. The only way is to exchange it at the Bank of China at the official price. One US dollar can only be exchanged for one-third of a rupee. Calculated in this way, the price of washing a shirt and a piece of underwear is about one US dollar! All other prices are also expensive. For example, the hotel we stayed in, the rooms are separated by wooden boards, and the width is less than two zhang (although this is already the largest hotel in Yangon after the war). A room for two people, including three meals, is 35 rupees per day, which is about 10 US dollars. For example, a local overseas Chinese took us to a bar-style dance hall for sightseeing. The entrance ticket was one rupee per person. Six people sat inside for a quarter of an hour and drank three bottles of beer, costing a total of 20 rupees, which is more than six US dollars.

Wandering in the Streets

Walking in the streets of Yangon, what you see is a colorful and unharmonious picture. Although the asphalt-paved streets are smooth, dust and garbage cover its beauty. The wounds of the war still exist. Even in the downtown area, you can see piles of rubble or buildings with only skeletons left. Tall foreign buildings are often next to low, dark mat sheds. There are street stalls everywhere, especially those selling food. Tables and chairs are placed in the open air, and all kinds of rough food are displayed on the tables. Flies are vying with customers to suck. Burmese people wearing red and green sarongs and Indian black charcoal people wearing bare feet and shorts mix into a complicated scene in the street. Although it is colorful, it cannot eliminate the fundamentally gray skin color and gray mood.

At night, the city is sparsely lit, and the dimness is even worse than the South City of Shanghai. We took a car around the city in the sultry air, and couldn't help but miss the trip to Hong Kong the night before. (Reported by Our Reporter Yuan Wenzhong)

### Tree Planting Day: News from Various Places

[Report from Our Shangrao Correspondent, 10th] On the occasion of Tree Planting Day, various agencies, organizations, schools, etc. of the city are scheduled to gather at Beitoucun Mountain to collectively afforest the land on the morning of this day. The county government is preparing 10,000 seedlings of masson pine for application.

[Report from Our Taixian Correspondent, 10th] To green Taixian County, the county construction section has formulated measures: (1) Mass planting of seedlings in Phoenix Mound and other places near the city; (2) Planting trees on both sides of the highway; (3) Each township will plant a minimum of 5,000 trees, and the seedlings required will be supplied by the county agricultural extension office.

### Inspecting Xuchang: Destruction and Robbery, a Scene of Desolation

[Report from Our Zhengzhou Correspondent, 8th] Upon arriving in Xuchang, one must first pass through the train station. After its recapture, the first impression upon inspection is the sheer devastation. The station once resembled Shanghai's North Railway Station, but now, the ticket office area is a scene of broken walls and rubble, akin to a deserted city. Although trains still stand in rows, they are mere empty shells, penetrable from any angle. Nearby tracks remain neatly laid, but farther out, they are twisted aside in a series, with no sleepers to be seen. Bridges are collapsed, some with steel bars hanging haphazardly. The Communist bandits thoroughly overturned the railway, deeming it necessary. Some people claim they had specialized tools for railway destruction, supplied by the Soviet Union, which used similar tools to disrupt railways and sever German troops during the defense of Leningrad. However, investigation reveals this is untrue. The bandits merely unscrewed the railway bolts and forced groups of 500 or 1000 civilians to use wooden sticks and ropes to overturn the tracks. They also used similar methods to force civilians to dismantle large houses' pillars and beams. After such destruction, the bandits would have the civilians clap and ask, "Destroyed, isn't it fun?" Within the city, numerous buildings, including several banks, the Senate, and the Guangwen Bookstore, which was targeted by the bandits, were left with only bare walls. The Communist bandits burned the Bank of Communications' furniture on the floor for warmth, resulting in a scorched floor. A church and hospital in Xiguan, while less severely damaged, made it impossible to salvage anything intact. Xuchang, where Cao Cao presented a robe to Guan Yu, is a place where locals hold him in high esteem; however, the statue of Guan Yu in the Guan Emperor Temple was also targeted by the Communist bandits and had its head cut off. On my first day, locals were already reconstructing it. All schools remained intact, leading some to remark that the Communist bandits showed "special favor" to the education sector. This "favor" was spoken with a hint of humor, and after reflection, I interpreted it as "conspiracy." The Communist bandits destroyed the Jianguo Daily, Xudu Daily, and Xuchang Daily, perhaps deeming these news enterprises as not belonging to the realm of culture.

Tobacco Production

During this period, the Communist bandits, under the guise of "bureaucratic capital," seized 82 tobacco factories in Xuchang, though the exact amount remains unconfirmed. It is estimated that the bandits seized 70% of the tobacco leaves produced in the five counties centered around Xuchang. These counties produce at least 150,000,000 catties of tobacco leaves. This year's tobacco harvest is only 40% of the normal yield, which would be 60,000,000 catties, with 70% being 42,000,000 catties. This is, of course, a considerable amount, although a portion was destroyed by fire during the battle at the train station. Food was consumed by the "eating-dry squads" and 60 cartloads were seized, resulting in significant losses. In Xuchang, the Communist bandits robbed under the pretext of "National Traitors." This was the reason used to loot places like the Gongji Hospital, Guangwen Bookstore, and all cooperatives. They also plundered under the guise of "bureaucratic capital," claiming that the capital belonged to a certain army commander or chairman. In one instance, the Taihe Tobacco Factory, the Communist bandits had already driven their vehicles to the door, prepared to move the factory's machinery and transport its technicians. The factory owner, Manager Li, argued with the bandits, who claimed they had received a report stating it was Liu Ruming's tobacco factory. Manager Li demanded evidence, but the bandits only repeated that they had

received a report. As a result, Manager Li argued fiercely with the bandits, who eventually drove their empty vehicles back, because many locals testified that he was a refugee from Changyuan who had started from selling tobacco at a street stall, working his way up to owning a tobacco factory. I visited the factory on my second day in Xuchang, and workers were steaming, curing, and rolling tobacco, with about 30 or 40 workers in total. It is said that the factory had not operated for a single day while the Communist bandits occupied the city. They only resumed operations after the National Army entered the city. Almost all means of transportation were looted, not even a single rickshaw remained. I heard locals say that "The Eighth Route Army" prohibited rickshaw pulling because it involved people pulling people, which was inhumane. I was surprised by this Communist miracle, but after inquiring, I learned that the Communist bandits' method of eliminating rickshaws was to first force them to convert their rickshaws into handcarts, and then order them to transport looted goods to eastern Henan, after which those carts and people disappeared. In the countryside, I asked a donkey owner, "Why do you still have a donkey?" The donkey owner replied, "Isn't it because the 'old eight'嫌(xián - dislike or suspect) it is skinny and sick?" He then told me that the Communist bandits in the villages demanded grain, people, and guns. (Reported by Our Reporter Fan Shiqin)

### Spring Famine in Xuzhou Area

[Special Dispatch from our Xuzhou Correspondent, 9th] The severe spring famine is already heavily weighing on the heads of more than four million people in the Xuzhou area. Calculating that it will take another three months until the new wheat of this summer can be eaten, how will these days of suffering and this critical juncture of life and death be overcome? This is truly a critical question for all the starving people in the nine counties and cities of the Xuzhou area and for those who care about this starving population.

On the Longhai Train

In order to understand the spring famine situation in the Fengxiao-Tongshan counties west of Xuzhou, last Thursday, I took a mixed train heading west from Xuzhou-Shangqiu section at 9:00 in the morning. When arriving at Xuzhou North Station, that long train was already crowded with dark-skinned people. Even the carriage steps, hooks, and car roofs were full of people, those places capable of standing. I searched carefully from the front to the back of the train, but could not find any room to stand. Finally, I squeezed onto the guard car after negotiating with the guard. However, the guard car was already full of passengers, so I had to squeeze myself into the compartment. According to people on the train, because the Xuzhou-Shangqiu section had just resumed traffic, there were too many people fleeing to Shangqiu (Shangqiu had a better harvest last fall, with grain prices one-third lower than here), doing small business, and trafficking in grain. Moreover, there was only one train a day, so it was of course extremely crowded, and many passengers were left behind on the platform outside the window as the train departed.

At the Huangkou Station

Three hours later, the train arrived at Huangkou Station. I climbed out of the carriage. At that time, the platform was crowded with people boarding, disembarking, and buying and selling snacks. I stood on the platform and waited for the train to leave the station before walking out of the station. At this time, I discovered that there were more than 300 people at Huangkou Station who wanted to go west but could not get on the train. They were carrying broken cotton wadding luggage and baskets. Among the crowd were elderly women in their eighties and nineties, infants, and women accounting for half of the number. It is said that these are all famine victims from the countryside near Huangkou who want to take the train to Minquan and Shangqiu to escape the famine. A station attendant told me that there are always three to five hundred people on this platform every day taking the train west to escape the famine. More than 20,000 people have left this spring, mostly residents of Xiao County, Feng County, and Tongshan County. These counties suffered severe floods last fall, plus the constant harassment of communist bandits burning, killing, and robbing, leaving the farmers almost destitute. Huangkou Station, this small town, has been robbed three times since the victory. This small town, which originally had a population of more than 5,000 and was quite prosperous, suffered an unprecedented disaster when the Chen bandits harassed the outskirts of Xuzhou in November last year. The eastern half of the residential houses and shops were completely destroyed. Today, only dilapidated walls and half of the town are ruins. Huangkou, after suffering the double disaster of floods and bandits, has now become a desolate scene.

Visiting the District Office

After lunch, I went to visit the District Office of the Eighth District of Xiao County. The District Chief happened to be out in the countryside collecting grain. An assistant named Li said: Xiao County has a total population of more than 670,000. The spring famine caused by this flood and bandit disaster has left 502,993 people in dire need of food, of which 210,369 people are in urgent need of relief, and the disaster situation in the Eighth and Tenth Districts is relatively severe. It is said that in Tangwo, Heilouzi, and other villages more than ten li north of Huangkou Station, eight out of ten residents have abandoned their homes and fled the famine. Now, almost nine out of ten families in the countryside have no grain to eat. Sweet potato leaves, bean cakes, wheat seedlings, and tree bark have become common foods for the masses.

Tasting Wheat Seedling Meal

After leaving the District Office and walking down the street, I met a good friend, Wang Yulin, whom I had not seen for many years. He said sadly, "The disaster situation is already unbearable to see." Then he said: "Relatives in the countryside, whose family has fled the famine, whose daughter has been sent to relatives in Nanjing to be raised as an adopted daughter, whose children have died from eating wheat seedlings and tree bark, and suffering from edema…" As he was speaking, his family's meal was brought out. He insisted that I join him. The meal was corn bread made from bean cake and wheat seedlings. One corn bread was enough for me. Wang Yulin is a middle-class family, and if their meal is like this, how can one not feel sad? After the meal, we went to the nearby countryside to take a walk. In the fields, we could see famine victims digging up wheat seedlings in twos and threes, and women and children peeling tree bark everywhere. When I approached, they all ran away, saying that officials had been sent to ban the digging of wheat seedlings. Some of the children shouted: "I'm digging up wild vegetables!" We looked at the children's backs and sighed, thinking that the wheat seedlings had been dug up this spring, so the wheat harvest this summer would be hopeless, affecting the food supply for the whole year.

Taking the train back to Xuzhou in the evening, my mind was filled with tragic images of refugees. (Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Zong Chunlin)

### International Exchange of Publications: Fourteen Large Boxes of Chinese Publications Shipped to Europe and America

[Shenzhou News Agency] The International Exchange Office of Publications of the National Central Library has recently received 42 boxes of books shipped to China by the American Book Center, and another ten boxes are on the way and will arrive soon. In addition, the Belgian government will also ship eight boxes of books to China. These books will be used to exchange for Chinese publications. According to the office, as of the beginning of February this year, 14 large boxes of Chinese books had been packed and shipped abroad, distributed as follows: Denmark one box, Belgium one box, the Netherlands one box, Czechoslovakia two boxes, France one box, the Soviet Union four boxes, and the United States four boxes. Recently, a box of books being shipped to Argentina, containing more than 200 volumes, is undergoing export procedures. The contents include "Interpretations of the Book of Poetry," "Bibliographies of Ming and Qing Dynasty Writings," "Yellow River Flood Control Project," and "Research from the Geological Survey of China." International publication exchange began in 1886, and an international publication exchange convention was established. China joined this convention in 1925, when the Ministry of Education established the "International Exchange Bureau of Publications" in Beijing. Later, it was transferred to the Central Research Institute and then to the Ministry of Education. In August 1945, when the government returned to Nanjing, the Ministry of Education, recognizing the importance of communication between international cultures, directly affiliated the bureau to the Central Library and formally established organizational regulations in July 1946. In addition to fulfilling the international exchange convention, representing the Chinese government in accepting publications from covenant governments, cataloging and storing them in the National Central Library for public viewing, it also collected publications from various government agencies in China and distributed them to covenant countries for exchange.

### American Atomic Scientists Announce New Metal Uranium-233

[Associated Press, New York, 11th] Atomic scientist Seaborg announced today that the chain reaction of graphite containing graphite in Hanford, Washington, transformed the heavy metal needle into tungsten, initially producing a new metal that can be used for atomic bombs and fuel. This new metal is an isotope of uranium, named "Uranium-233," and is produced in extremely small quantities. Only a few hundred cubic centimeters have been manufactured, and it has no natural source on Earth. It is unknown whether it exists on planets. Currently, extracting the atomic uranium of tungsten may therefore produce more than one type of atomic energy metal, and the application of larger amounts of tungsten metal to atomic bombs is unrealistic.

### Hangzhou Air Force School Basketball Team to Conquer Shanghai – First Battle Tonight Against the U.S. Air Force at 7:30 PM in the Gymnasium

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Hangzhou Basketball Champion, the Qiao Air Force Officer School basketball team, in order to explore their strength, recently dispatched instructor Yao Zhi to Shanghai to connect with the Basketball Committee, planning to come to Shanghai for an expedition. After proper consultation, the team arrived in Shanghai by train from Hangzhou yesterday and is scheduled to show their skills for the first time tonight at the City Gymnasium. Their first battle will be against the U.S. Air Force, commencing at 6:30 PM at the City Gymnasium. The school's Shanghai match schedule is arranged as follows: 13th against the U.S. Air Force at 6:30 PM, 14th against Encas at 7:30 PM, 15th against a mixed team at 8:30 PM.

The Air Force School is the Wulin champion, with formidable strength. In the Hangzhou Winter Charity Games, they successively defeated strong local teams Qingbai and Chenyou. Although they were defeated by Hualian Dagong, their overall performance is said to be quite remarkable and will be a strong rival in this city. This expedition to Shanghai aims to learn from each other and provide excellent performances.

[Air Force School] Wu Xihong (leader), Shu Hong (advisor), Yao Zhizhong (instructor), Xu Weiyuan (captain) (No. 2), Lu Qing (No. 4), Yuan Shixian (No. 6), You Jianxing (No. 5), Liao Xuewen (No. 2), Sun Huanting (No. 9), Zhu Zhen (No. 7), Zhu Shengyi (No. 8), Qiu Zhongwen (No. 10), Liao Shiwei (No. 11), Lü Huaimin (No. 12).

[U.S. Air Force] Matusky, Palosky, Oer, Lehman, Laquist, Haick, Elit, Pagan, Bowler, Baker-Wheeler. Tonight's basketball league schedule has been slightly changed due to the Hangzhou Air Force School's arrival in Shanghai. The original U.S. Air Force vs. Encas game has been rescheduled with Encas's consent. Admission tickets remain at $30,000/$60,000, with reserved seating inside the venue costing $100,000. The lineup is as follows:

Donghua vs. Yanghang (Division Two B) at 5:30 PM

Air Force School vs. U.S. Air Force (Friendship Match) at 6:30 PM

Hualian vs. Chenyou (Division One A) at 7:30 PM

The first game is Donghua vs. Yanghang. Donghua has won every game in Division Two B, and tonight is their last battle. The whole team has abundant stamina. Yanghang has given up hope for the championship, but their fighting spirit is also strong, and tonight is also their last game.

The second act is the friendship match between the Hangzhou Air Force School and the U.S. Air Force. The visiting team is the Wulin champion, with formidable strength. Liao Xuewen, Xu Weiyuan, You Jianxing, and others are all key players for the team. This expedition to Shanghai was originally intended for further exchanges with Hualian Dagong, but due to the league schedule, the two Hualian teams cannot participate, so they will face the U.S. Air Force instead. The meeting of the Chinese and American Air Forces will be quite a spectacle.

The final act is the Division One A rematch between Hualian and Chenyou. Hualian is undefeated and the championship is almost certainly theirs. However, in the first round, they narrowly defeated Chenyou by one point. Tonight, they meet again, and Chenyou still intends to try again, so there should be a fierce performance.

### Thorny Issues in School Administration – Today's University Guidance (Continued from Yesterday)

— Sun Daoyuan

The current regulations for the organization of university guidance have raised the qualifications of general guidance personnel (department directors must be associate professors or above, and counselors must be lecturers or above). They have also established Guidance Committees to gather professors to discuss guidance matters. However, these titular professors and lecturers, who have fine reputations but often do not teach students regular courses, are still not valued by students. In reality, the people most respected by students in universities are not the "heads" and "officials" who wield administrative power, but rather professors who possess high moral character and extensive knowledge. Therefore, professors play a decisive role in genuinely proactive guidance in universities. Their daily "words and deeds" and "tendencies" unconsciously serve as guides and role models for the students in the school. Therefore, university guidance is not a formal training, but rather a cultivation of a harmonious collective life, so that it naturally forms an elegant "custom" and "atmosphere." This "custom" and "atmosphere" is what is commonly called "school spirit." "School spirit," more concretely speaking, is the habit of collective living of the entire university. This "habit" is also the unwritten law that university guidance of students follows as a custom; in other words, it is the most perfect social legislation naturally formed in this university society. Not only students must abide by it, but professors must also abide by it. It is the discipline of this group. Therefore, "university life," indirectly speaking, is proactive university guidance. Dewey once said: "Life is education; education is life." If life is done wrong, education is also wrong. Therefore, the proactive role of university guidance is to guide how to live "university life." Contemporary educators should put their minds to practical consideration of this issue, which cannot be summarized by empty abstract words. For example, the ideologies and lifestyles of university students, as well as the coordination between teachers and students, all require very concrete and natural inspiration, so that every young person who steps into the door of the university can gladly accept this new life's cultivation and turn it into a habit that cannot be parted from their lives. Thus, university graduates who have received four years of higher education will almost certainly add a new and vibrant cell to the country when they leave school.

Furthermore, the technical problems in the implementation of university guidance are not merely the problems of the executor and the guided, but rather the problems of the entire school. "Guidance" should be something that the entire school, from top to bottom, consistently follows. Whoever does not abide by it is a degenerate whom everyone abandons. Believing in and acting upon this together, as a matter of habit, will naturally become a life habit that everyone abides by together. Therefore, all guidance facilities in a school should not only be understood by students, but also should be fully known to every faculty and staff member, so that they can consciously and automatically promote it to students anytime and anywhere. They do not need to specially set aside time to assist in "guidance"; as long as they can maintain the meaning of "guidance" in their consistent words and deeds. In this way, "guidance" and "life" are integrated, and teaching and guidance are combined, subtly influencing each university student to embark on the right path without realizing it.

The Responsibility of Guidance

I think that the liberal university education must be matched with the university guidance with the spirit of autonomy. However, in today's universities, the entire responsibility of guidance is placed on a few guidance personnel in a guidance office, and most faculty and staff members are turned into outsiders who are irrelevant bystanders, so that teaching and guidance go their own ways and govern themselves. Although universities have established a student advisor system to make up for this deficiency, the result is still equivalent to a formality due to environmental and factual obstacles. Finally, I offer two principles for the implementation of university guidance today:

"Advocate the Integration of Teaching and Guidance,"

"Implement Life Guidance."

The "Integration of Teaching and Guidance" that I am advocating does not literally mean merging the two departments of teaching and guidance in a school, but rather entrusting "guidance" to "teaching," so that most professors, in addition to teaching, should not forget to "be a teacher and a role model," and should teach tirelessly. Secondly, the so-called "Life Guidance" is that professors with a "demonstration" effect should be able to integrate their lives with the lives of students, in order to implement teaching that is consistent in "body" and "mind," and to break away from all the empty guidance methods of the past where words and deeds did not match. The so-called bodily teaching is tangible teaching; the so-called mental teaching is intangible teaching. Tangible teaching means that all teachers should "lead by example" and be able to lead from the front in everything and be a role model for students in everything. Intangible teaching means that every professor should not only be able to be a compass for "action," but also be able to be consistent in "word" and "deed," and be able to speak and act, and be able to do what they say, to be worthy of being a "good teacher."

Ask Professors for Assistance

However, if we want to practice this universal "Life Guidance," we cannot rely solely on the efforts of the guidance personnel of a school, but must rely on the joint guidance and assistance of all professors, pooling our wisdom and efforts, to achieve effective results. Therefore, advocating "Integration of Teaching and Guidance" is indeed the prelude to implementing "Life Guidance." From the significance of the recent order from the ministry requiring all universities to change "Ethics" to a required course for all students, we can understand that today's education authorities are gradually strengthening the "Integration of Teaching and Guidance." However, reviewing the "Ethics" and "Party Principles" courses, which are most relevant to students' thoughts and behaviors, in today's university curriculum has not achieved the desired effect. The reason for this is that the "implementation of guidance" and the teaching of "Ethics" and "Party Principles" in a school each go their own way and have no connection at all, so that "theory" and "practice" not only cannot be coordinated, but even contradict and contradict each other. How can such guidance, where "knowledge" and "action" cannot be unified, be convincing? The ideal university guidance that we believe in is that "theory" and "practice" must be consistent; the technique for implementing university guidance that we are talking about is that "theory" and "practice" must be coordinated. (End)

### Four Joint Offices Approve Summary of Exchange Settlement for Export Goods – Taking 10% of Total Export Exchange Settlement as the Loan Standard

In order to promote export trade and increase foreign exchange income, the government, through the foreign exchange bank, the Bank of China, formulated the Summary of Fixed Exchange Settlement Quotas for National Bank Export Goods in the 37th year of the Republic of China, which was submitted to the Four Joint Offices for approval. The main points are recorded as follows:

1. The loan target is limited to export goods that have a definite market abroad, and the types of loan goods may be increased or decreased at any time depending on overseas market conditions.

2. When exporters of the above-mentioned goods apply for loans, they must provide the quantity of export goods and exchange settlement records for the previous year for verification.

3. The loan banks will refer to the exporter's export exchange settlement records for the previous year and determine the estimated total amount of foreign exchange settlement for this year. One-tenth of this estimated exchange settlement amount will be used as the loan standard. Then, it will be converted into the number of national currency according to the benchmark market price of the Balancing Fund at the time of the loan, which will be used as the working capital loan for each bank.

4. The above-mentioned working capital loan is tentatively set for a valid period of six months. The maximum loan period is one month each time, and it can be done repeatedly. However, the exporter must sell the export bill of exchange to the loan bank to repay the loan every month when it is due. The export bill of exchange sold shall be no less than one-tenth of the estimated total amount of foreign exchange sold for this year.

5. If the exporter fails to fulfill the monthly exchange settlement conditions for the export bill of exchange, the loan bank may purchase the collateral at the loan price in accordance with the government's export goods purchase measures, and use the purchase price to pay off the loan principal and interest.

### Textile Machinery Production Conference Closed Yesterday Morning; Minister Chen Discusses Five-Year Plan for the Textile Industry

Over forty experts, including Pan Yangshan, were invited to attend. Minister Chen Qitian personally presided over the meeting. The proposals discussed included: (A) the draft implementation plan for manufacturing 100,000 spindles formulated by the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The plan is as follows: (1) the number of spindles to be manufactured (100,000 spindles, with 20-count yarn as the standard); (2) the completion deadline is one year (from June 1948 to May 1949); (3) the selection of the 10,000 spindles of textile machinery to be matched, and the style; (4) the grouping and division of labor for machinery manufacturing [100,000 spindles will be divided into ten groups, each group with 10,000 spindles as a unit, to be contracted by dividing the work; it is planned to entrust 18 companies such as Shengsheng Ironworks]; (5) the accounting of labor and materials; (6) the acceptance of the machinery; (7) the supply of power, etc.  (B) The Central Machinery Corporation of the Resources Committee proposed that the Ministry of Economic Affairs apply to the Four Banks Joint Office for a special loan to order 100,000 spindles of spinning machines and 3,000 looms annually to promote the industry, and to stipulate important dimensions of textile machinery to meet standards and facilitate manufacturing.  (C) Pan Yangshan, Chairman of the Chongqing Industrial Association, proposed to seize the time to increase cotton yarn production as early as possible, and to order the entire output for two to three years from domestic manufacturers who are already capable of manufacturing complete sets of yarn mill machinery.  (D) Zhu Xianfang proposed to organize a joint venture textile machinery manufacturing company.  (E) Gu Yaoqiu proposed, in order to promote the realization of the textile industry construction plan and save the crisis of private mechanical industry, to request the government to allocate special funds, or take 10% of the proceeds from the sale of the China Textile Company as special funds, and use the form of order loans to entrust private machinery factories to manufacture textile machinery, etc., totaling six items. The Ministry of Economic Affairs proposed eight items, as follows: (1) to stipulate the style and dimensions of textile machinery in China, make blueprints, and require all factories manufacturing textile machinery in the country to uniformly follow and adopt them; (2) to formulate the standards for textile machine parts and unify their names; (3) to determine the conditions that textile machinery manufacturing factories should possess; (4) to review the manufacturing capabilities of existing domestic textile machinery manufacturing factories, and divide the total quantity of textile machinery listed in the textile machinery construction plan agreed upon at the National Textile Industry Production Conference to be contracted by each factory; (5) to discuss the types and quantities of textile machinery to be imported from abroad; (6) to coordinate the raw materials for manufacturing textile machinery; (7) to define the inspection standards for textile machinery manufactured in China. Due to the large number of proposals, the conference will be extended for one day today (the 13th).

Yesterday, at the textile machinery manufacturing conference convened by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the reporter met Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian and inquired about the progress of the ministry's five-year plan for the textile industry in the past six months. Mr. Chen replied that there are currently no concrete facts to report, and everything is still in the preparation stage. Promoting the textile industry, the preparation work in the preparation period is the most important. If all relevant issues can be resolved during the preparation period, it will be very easy to achieve good results when promoting. The textile machinery conference convened this time is one of the preparation works. In short, the Ministry of Economic Affairs will spare no effort to promote this plan and strive to gradually realize it within five years.

### Silk Prices All Retreat

Yesterday, the artificial silk market saw a straight decline. The price of 120-count "Ziyouguang" opened at 224 million yuan for immediate delivery and 29.5 million yuan for forward delivery.  Selling was greater than buying, and asking prices frequently decreased. At the noon close, forward delivery was trading at 17 million yuan. The afternoon continued the downward trend, dropping from 15 million yuan to a selling price of 20.06 million yuan, a drop of 27 million yuan compared to the previous day.

Factory-reeled silk also declined yesterday. In the morning, C-grade transactions occurred at a price of 290 million yuan, a premium of 8.5 million yuan over high-grade short-term tickets. High-grade short-term tickets were offered at around 240 million yuan, but no transactions took place. In the afternoon, due to the sharp fall in artificial silk, market sentiment weakened, and transactions were very few. Asking prices for all grades were slightly softer than in the morning.

### Tight Money, Rising Prices;  White Rice Sees New High

Although the rice market saw a slight recovery the day before yesterday, it was only a flash in the pan. Yesterday, the price of white rice in the North Market rose to 3.88 million yuan, and the price of premium rice reached a new high of 3.98 million yuan, only 20,000 yuan away from the 4 million yuan mark. Each rose sharply by 100,000 and 120,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Pu rice was 3.8 million yuan, and high-quality sheep rice traded at 3.9 million yuan, higher than the previous day by 100,000 yuan. Other varieties such as fragrant rice and white rice also increased by about 100,000 yuan each. In the South Market, the morning market saw the strongest rise. White rice opened at 3.85 million yuan, an increase of 200,000 yuan. Thin rice and other varieties also followed. However, due to the tight money supply and the impact of household rice, "Naluqi" was weak and then declined. White rice finally traded at 3.75 million yuan, the same price as thin rice, an increase of 100,000 and 50,000 yuan respectively. Yesterday's rise was still due to the rise in Wuxi. Also, the sharp rise in various non-agricultural products was also a reason for the rise. Yesterday, 2,514 piculs arrived in the South Market and 6,802 piculs in the North Market, totaling 9,316 piculs.

### Woolen Cloth Trading Quiet, "Van Lidding" Goods Flood the Market

Yesterday, there were not many wholesale transactions of woolen cloth at the inspection tea party. Retail business in the Qipan Street shops was also quiet. The number of clothes currently being made in men's and women's clothing stores in various districts is limited. Under high prices, purchasing power is weakening one after another. "Van Lidding" woolens have recently continued to appear on the market. First-grade is offered at 2.56 million yuan per yard, second-grade at 2.12 million yuan, and third-grade at 1.67 million yuan. There are many patterns of striped and solid colors, but very few actual transactions, because the products of large and small factories are flooding the market, and those processed by Yihe Factory are piled up like mountains. With a large number of chips currently being prepared, both buyers and sellers are apprehensive, and most are adopting a slow-paced approach to avoid wasting interest in vain.

### Consolidated Bonds Continue to Rise, Foreign Stocks Step Down

Government bonds reached new highs again yesterday, with a stable and consistent process, and trading increased to more than six million. Consolidated Bonds C opened strongly at 12,000, rising to 13,000 before settling slightly. 555, 500, and 614 rose, while 503, 552, and Chengde declined. Compared to the previous close, A, B, and E each rose 4,000 yuan, Consolidated Bonds C rose 8,000 yuan, and Consolidated Bonds D rose 7,000 yuan.

Foreign stocks suddenly fell sharply yesterday, with many significant declines. Securities firms and Guangdong firms were selling heavily, foreign merchants' profits were greatly reduced, and except for British-China and Telephone, which fell slightly, all were weak. Yi Yarn opened in the morning at 1.9 million, rising from 1.91 million, gradually declining to around 1.73 million before stopping. Compared to the previous close, Shipping fell 20%, Yi Yarn, Guangyi, Steel Industry, and Langel's each fell 10% to 15%, British Federation and Jardine Matheson fell 5%, and Telephone British-China declined.

### Galvanized Iron Wire in Imported Goods with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Not Allowed to be Re-exported; Collection Deadline Extended

[This newspaper's report] The Review Committee for the Purchase of Goods Arriving with Uncertified Self-Provided Foreign Exchange held a routine meeting on the 11th. The China Trust Bureau had previously issued Public Notice No. 11, stating that galvanized iron wire arriving and already shipped with self-provided foreign exchange would be purchased by the bureau on behalf of the government and would not be allowed to be re-exported. However, because the original invoices for this iron wire often do not specify the wire gauge, and the British and American standards are not, it is difficult for the Export-Import Management Committee to make prior statements when issuing import licenses. It was decided that in order to facilitate the issuance of licenses and the progress of the purchase work, all galvanized iron wire under Customs Tariff No. 205 arriving with self-provided foreign exchange, regardless of gauge, would not be allowed to be re-exported and would be purchased by the China Trust Bureau on behalf of the government.  The duplicate bill of lading and invoice would then be submitted to the Ministry of National Defense, which would send personnel to the warehouse to physically inspect the goods. If they were needed, they would be issued; if not, they would still be handed over to the bureau for priority purchase by the direct users of the original orders, and to facilitate importers' applications for purchase, the purchase deadline would be extended to 70 days from the date of the bureau's Public Notice No. 11 on February 14.  All original importers should promptly apply to the Export-Import Management Committee's Import Quota Allocation Office for purchase in accordance with the prescribed procedures within this deadline.

### Bulls All Emerge, Chinese Stocks Gradually Decline

Chinese stocks retreated sharply yesterday after being bullish, spending most of the time in a sluggish state. All the bulls in the securities firms emerged, external stimulation was greatly reduced, the dark interest rate increased to beyond three corners, and gradually declined, ending the close at a low price.

At the morning opening, the news of the Four Banks Joint Office's production loans caused prices to rise, and Yong Yarn went on the market at prices of 5,100 yuan and 1,600 yuan, rising to 1,508 yuan and 1,603 yuan after the opening. With tight money and dark interest rates rising to three and a half corners, securities firms were actively cutting long positions. Except for Xinyi, which rose to the limit, all saw declines. Although there were occasional rises and falls in the middle, individual investors were pressed for time, and the industry did not add support, falling to low prices of 1,420 yuan and 1,523 yuan near noon. The noon close was 1,432 yuan and 1,532 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, except for Xinyi, which rose to the limit, the spot delivery stocks of Yong Yarn, Huaxin, and China Silk fell slightly. Underwear, China Textile, and Yonggong were each lower by 10% to 15%, and the rest fell by about 5%. Forward delivery stocks, Meyer and Xinhuo, fell by 5%, and the rest fell slightly.

After the market opened from 1,450 yuan and 1,530 yuan, they were gradually sold to 1,420 yuan and 1,505 yuan. News reports mentioned the intensification of aid to China, and they retreated to 1,412 yuan and 1,490 yuan. Although 190 and 183 rose, 145, 71, and 154 were still sold, retreating further to low prices of 1,408 yuan and 1,490 yuan. The closing price was 1,410 yuan and 1,493 yuan. Except for Xinyi, which still stood at the limit, all declined. Compared with the morning close, Xinyi rose to the limit, Firecracker and Jinglun were flat, China Textile and Underwear rose slightly, and the rest declined slightly. Forward delivery stocks, Huafeng, fell by 5%, and the rest fell slightly. Various unlisted stocks outside the market remained stable, with Jiaotong, Huashang, Nanyang, Dasheng, and Guanshengyuan each rising by 5%.

### Central Bank Issues Bonuses for Cracking Down on Gold Speculation

[This newspaper's report] It was recently learned from the Central Bank that in Shanghai, in order to crack down on the illegal trading of gold, all physical objects seized by military and police agencies will be transferred to the bank for safekeeping. After the confiscation is confirmed, the bank will advance the bonus to the seizing agencies and informants. Since its implementation, rewarding informants has been effective. Regarding the bonuses to be awarded for cracking down on the illegal trading of gold in Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places, the bank will also be allowed to issue them according to the Shanghai regulations.

### Tea Firms Telegraph Four Banks Joint Office to Allocate Loans for Crude Tea

The Shanghai Tea Trade Association telegraphed the Nanjing Four Banks Joint Office yesterday to apply for loans for crude tea, stating that the association's members engage in the business of purchasing, transporting, and selling tea. Every tea season, they go to the producing areas to set up purchasing stations. The tea they collect, in addition to supplying domestic sales, also provides crude tea raw materials to more than 30 tea factories in Shanghai, which are made into boxed tea for export. Taking last year as an example, the total amount of boxed tea exported was more than 260,000 piculs, half of which came from loans, and a part of the raw materials was supplied by tea firms. Therefore, the tea firms, tea manufacturing, and export industries are interdependent. The association's members received loans from the Four Banks Joint Office the year before last, which enabled them to maximize the effectiveness of their purchases. Last year, however, due to a late application, they were informed that tea loans had been gradually terminated and it was difficult to comply, etc. Tea production is most elastic; the more purchasers there are, the higher the tea farmers' interest, and the more production there is. If overseas sales are brisk, tea firms' crude tea can be used entirely as raw materials for export. Recently, this year's new tea will soon be on the market. How to provide loans to encourage increased production must be within the overall planning of the head office. However, wages in the producing areas are high, and the cost of crude tea has increased sharply. With tea merchants' financial resources, it is difficult to carry out purchasing work. Therefore, it is proposed to allocate some crude tea loans under the entire tea loan item in accordance with previous precedents to meet the needs of the association's more than 60 members for purchasing raw materials for boxed tea.

### Yarn and Cloth Price Increase Slightly Eased; Asking Prices All Fall

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw prices rising in the morning due to rising external market reports and strong interest from both local and external buyers, with asking prices remaining firm. However, as the monetary situation tightened both inside and outside the industry and the distribution period for yarn from the Textile Construction Company approached, and prices had been rising sharply for several days, people were uneasy. Short-term traders sensitive to their cash positions were the first to take advantage of the high prices and sell, causing the market atmosphere to relax. All parties stopped advancing and turned to selling, and short-sellers took the opportunity to become active. Buyers also became sluggish. Many profitable bulls sold off one after another, and asking prices gradually fell. Finally, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn closed at a low price of 177 million yuan, a decrease of 3 million yuan compared to the previous day. Bingguang and Jincheng brands also dropped by 3 to 4 million yuan. For 20-count yarns, prices declined slightly from 500,000 to over 1 million yuan, because buyers were willing to absorb at low prices. Other coarse and fine yarns such as 10-count, 16-count, and 32-count also declined by 1.4 to 1.5 million yuan to 2 to 3 million yuan.

The cotton cloth market saw strong demand from individual traders and a few purchases from large traders at the opening, and prices rose again. Longtou fine cloth even surged to the 4 million yuan mark. However, due to a large number of spot sales from Hankou and Northern traders, and as individual traders saw that sales were turning sluggish, many also sold. Furthermore, the Textile Construction Company released a large number of chips, and cloth merchants competed to sell due to tight credit conditions in the industry and concerns about high prices. Buyers adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and the market was filled with cries of "sell," so prices began to fall. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth fell straight to a closing price of 3.73 million yuan, but it was still an increase of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Wufu and Yanghe brands also rose by 25,000 yuan. Blue Crane and Caiqiu saw mixed rises and falls. In addition, coarse cloth, bleached cloth, fine twill, and colored cloth were still selling actively, and the market was still bullish. Due to insufficient supply from manufacturers, Shilin cloth rose gradually by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan to 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Other varieties such as broadcloth, Zhigong, and Nafuto were trending in a sluggish state.

### Kerosene and Candles Rise Repeatedly

The kerosene market continued to rise due to the continuous reports of shrinking supply from Hong Kong, and wholesale transactions among traders were frequent. High-grade barrel goods traded at 16.7 million yuan, and Mobil and Asia Oil in tins rose to 2 million yuan. Retail prices increased to 45,000 yuan per can, and limited-price oil remained at 25,000 yuan per catty.

Candles, due to the scarcity and high price of raw material oils and fats, increased costs, and strong sales, with external parties also absorbing supplies, caused prices to rise repeatedly. Wholesale prices for Whiteley's Ship brand rose to 2.7 million yuan per case, Monk's Hat to 2.8 million yuan, Chicken brand to 2 million yuan, and Camel and Red Fortune to 1.78 million yuan.

### Oils and Fats Rise

Oils and fats, which are used extensively in industry, saw reduced allocations of oils, fats, and waxes to soap manufacturers in the Fourth District by the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, resulting in a shortage of raw materials and a panic in the soap industry. The industry has a strong need for tallow raw materials. In addition to the association submitting a document to the authorities to appeal, it is also searching the market and absorbing supplies strongly. Asking prices have risen, with Qingdao and Zhapu sources of supply unable to keep up, and market inventories are weak. Tallow is priced as high as 15 million yuan, with recent noon prices being 4 million yuan. Coconut oil soared to 24 million yuan per dan, Boshan Wo Ben to 11 million yuan, and snow-melt and orchid oil to 10.35 million yuan. All oils continued to rise by 10% to 20%.

### Chinese Medicine Gradually Rises

Since the increase in freight, Chinese medicine has risen repeatedly. Grade 1 old-picked frankincense has reached a new high of 700,000 yuan. Taichang agastache is 240,000 yuan, Qingjia slices are 260,000 yuan, Fuji chuanxiong is 120,000 yuan, Chuanxiong King is 110,000 yuan, Diaochuanxiong is 100,000 yuan, Rehmannia root is 85,000 yuan, and Tianjin Fangfeng is 180,000 yuan, with a strong upward trend. All are due to exchange rate fluctuations, increased freight costs, and higher foreign exchange rates.

### Taiwanese Dollar Exchange Rate Increased to 1:189 Yuan

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 12th] The exchange rate between the Taiwanese dollar and the legal tender will be increased to 1:189 yuan starting from the 12th.

### China Farmers' Bank Will Convene Branch Meeting to Discuss Promoting Agricultural Loan Program

[This newspaper's report] After the total agricultural and land finance loan amount for this year, totaling 15 trillion yuan, was formally approved by the board of directors of the Four Banks Joint Office on the 11th, Mr. Li Shuming, General Manager of the China Farmers Bank, who attended the meeting, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing on the morning of the 12th. According to Mr. Li, the focus of the Farmers Bank's work and the economic future will be on increasing agricultural production, using effective methods to ensure that funds reach the hands of farmers directly, and further improving agricultural loan methods to ensure they are sound. The implementation steps will be to convene a meeting of branch managers and agricultural loan management personnel from all over the country in the coming days to announce the industry's planned promotion plan and adopt opinions for a systematic discussion in order to implement the task and achieve significant results. Mr. Li emphasized whether the implementation of agricultural loans would affect the market. He emphasized that these loans must be carried out by month and province, with a longer time frame and a vast area. The actual recipients will be in rural areas, and they will be isolated from the market. Even in the peak season for agricultural loans, it will be no more than about 3 trillion per month. Finally, he traced the drafting of this plan to its beginning in November of last year, with more than ten revisions before the final draft was completed. The important points of the content include the implementation period, taking into account the supply of funds from the National Bank, and how to ensure that farmers benefit directly.

### To Prevent Import and Export Smuggling; China-Macau Agreement Implemented Today; Export-Import Management Committee Announces Seven Categories of Goods for Which Import and Export Certificates Must Be Submitted

According to a spokesman for the Central Bank, since the Sino-Hong Kong Financial Agreement was signed, representatives of the Central Bank and the Macao government have completed consultations. In the spirit of cooperation and goodwill, after careful and precise discussions, they agreed to implement the following measures similar to the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement. Starting today, major export goods from China, such as antimony, bristles, cotton yarn, tea, tin, tungsten, and various vegetable oils, including tung oil and rapeseed oil, transported through Macao for re-export must be submitted with a certificate proving that the foreign exchange earned from the export of the goods from China has been sold or agreed to be sold to designated banks within China. Otherwise, the Macao government will not allow re-export. Starting from the same date, goods transported from Macao to China, if their value exceeds 200 patacas or its equivalent, must first present an import license issued by the Export-Import Management Committee of China. Otherwise, the Macao government will not allow its export. The Macao government also prohibits carrying more than 5 million yuan of national currency in cash into the mountains. This measure is the same as the current restrictions on the shipment of cash by the Chinese and Hong Kong governments. The above measures provide valuable assistance to the management of China's foreign exchange and import and export trade, making the implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong Financial Agreement more stringent. The Chinese government can prevent the loss of foreign exchange due to export smuggling.

Yesterday, the Export-Import Management Committee issued Public Notices No. 25 and 26 for the China-Macau Agreement as follows: "It has been determined that the authorities in China and Macau have agreed that starting from March 13, 1948 (1) antimony, (2) bristles, (3) cotton yarn, (4) tea, (5) tin, (6) tungsten ore, and (7) various vegetable oils (i.e., tung oil, rapeseed oil, cinnamon oil, star anise oil, castor oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, perilla oil, tea oil), etc., of these seven categories of goods, those re-exported, transshipped, or transported from Macao must submit a (C.BC.8a revised) certificate to the Macao authorities proving that the foreign exchange obtained from the loading of the goods from our country to Macao has been sold or agreed to be sold to the designated banks in the country. In the future, exporters must fill out the 'C.B.C.8a revised' certificate in five copies for the above-mentioned goods shipped from the country to Macau or transshipped through Macau. After the certificate is certified by the designated bank in the country, it will still be submitted to the customs in accordance with the usual procedures, and one copy will be stamped by the customs and returned to the original applicant for safekeeping and shipped with the goods to Macau for verification by the Commissioner of Customs of Gongbei. If the goods need to be transshipped from Macau in the future, they should also be submitted to the Macau authorities for inspection.

"It has been determined that the authorities in China and Macau have agreed that for goods shipped from Macao to our country, if their value exceeds 200 Macao patacas (or the equivalent in other currencies), the original import license issued by this committee for the goods must first be presented to the Macao authorities; otherwise, the Macao authorities will not release them. After the necessary procedures for the above regulations have been completed, the original of the import license will be returned to the exporter by the Macao authorities.

Cultural History

### Examining the Age of Completion of the *Shui Jing Zhu*

— Hu Shi

The author of the *Shui Jing Zhu*, Li Daoyuan, died in the third year of Tuoba Wei Xiaochang (527 AD), which was the first year of the Datong era of Emperor Wu of Liang. The year in which the *Shui Jing Zhu* was completed is unknown, but the book occasionally mentions contemporary historical events and figures related to the author. This kind of material should help us determine the year in which Li Daoyuan wrote the book. Unexpectedly, scholars of the past instead suspected these contemporary historical facts, saying that they were added in by later generations. He Zhuo, Zhao Yiqing, and others all held such suspicions, but in fact, these were all due to their own occasional erroneous research.

For example, Volume 28 of the *Shui Jing Zhu* quotes a line from Wu Jun's poem "Sword." He Zhuo said:

"Daoyuan and Wu Jun were contemporaries, how could he quote his poem? I suspect that this book has many additions by later generations." Zhao Yiqing's *Shui Jing Bian Shi* (28, leaf 2) says:

"According to the *History of the Southern Dynasties*, Wu Jun was appointed as a registrar by Liu Yun, who was serving as the governor of Wuxing during the early years of the Tianjian era. At the time of Daoyuan, Wu Jun's position and reputation were still low, and his writings may not have circulated outside of the Jiangnan region. Yi Men's words can be considered insightful."

Neither of these two pieces of research can be considered "insightful." The *Book of Liang*, in its biography of Wu Jun, records that he died in the first year of the Putong era of Emperor Wu of Liang (520 AD) at the age of fifty-two, which was seven years before Li Daoyuan's death. Both the *Book of Liang* and the *History of the Southern Dynasties* say that Wu Jun's poems were "imitated by enthusiasts at the time, and called the Wu Jun style," indicating that his poems were very popular. At that time, the literary works of the Northern and Southern Dynasties circulated easily between each other, so the *Shui Jing Zhu* often quotes Shen Yue's *History of the Song Dynasty*, and also quotes Wang Zhishen's *History of the Song Dynasty* (Volume 25). Even historical records could circulate outside of the Jiangnan region, let alone poems? Therefore, it is not at all strange that Li Daoyuan quoted Wu Jun's line of poetry.

Another example is in Volume 28 of the *Shui Jing Zhu*, under the entry for Juchao County, there is a note about "Zhao Zu's City" and "Hu Jing's City." Zhao Yiqing's *Shui Jing Zhu Jian Kan Wu* 10, leaf 25, says that "Hu City" should be "Hu Jing City." He also says:

"In the fourth year of the Tianjian era of the Liang Dynasty, the Liang Dynasty invaded Wei's Hefei. Hu Jing and Zhao Zuyue were in the same army and had a feud, which Wei Dan resolved. This matter is recorded in the biography of Wei Dan in the *History of the Southern Dynasties*. However, there is a great deal of doubt about this. The fourth year of the Tianjian era of the Liang Dynasty was the first year of the Xiaochang era. The following year, Daoyuan was murdered in Yinpan. Who knows when the book was completed? How could he take the building of cities by Hu and Zhao as evidence?… This is the same mistake as… quoting Wu Jun's poetry."

This passage has three major errors. (1) The fourth year of the Tianjian era of the Liang Dynasty was 505 AD, while the first year of the Xiaochang era of the Wei Dynasty was 525 AD, a difference of twenty years. How can it be said that the fourth year of the Tianjian era was the first year of the Xiaochang era! (2) Li Daoyuan died in the third year of the Xiaochang era (527 AD), so it cannot be said that it was "the following year." (3) The exact year in which Zhao Zuyue and Hu Jing built their cities is unknown. If they built the cities in the fourth year of the Tianjian era, then that would be twenty-two years before Daoyuan's death. It is not at all strange that the *Shui Jing Zhu* mentions these place names.

Another example is in Volume 32 of the *Shui Jing Zhu*, in the note for "Huai County, Jiangxia," Zhao Yiqing says:

"According to the *Book of Sui Geography*, the Liang Dynasty established the three prefectures of Mianyang, Yingyang, and Zhoucheng, and the two counties of Zhouling and Huiwan. … Daoyuan died in the second year of the Xiaochang era, only five years after the first year of the Tianjian era! Who knows when the book was completed, but how could he suddenly mention the establishment of the new dynasty in Jiangnan? This was added in by later generations, which can be mutually verified with the quote of Wu Jun's poetry in the note on the Mian River." (*Shui Jing Zhu Shi* 32, leaf 15)

Here, there are three more major errors. (1) Daoyuan died in the third year of the Xiaochang era, not the second year, as mentioned earlier. (2) The first year of the Tianjian era (502) was twenty-five years before the third year of the Xiaochang era, not just five years apart! (3) Zhao accidentally misquoted the *Book of Sui Geography* and did not compare it with earlier histories. For example, under the entry for the governor of Yingzhou in the *Book of Song Geography*, there is

"Grand Administrator of Jiangxia"

"Huiwan, Xiang of the tenth, Jiangzuo's."

"Grand Administrator of Baling"

"Zhouling, Xiang of the state, old county of the Han."

Similarly, in the *History of the Southern Dynasties Geography*, the Jiangxia Prefecture of Yingzhou has Huiwan County, and the Baling Prefecture has Zhouling County. Therefore, it is not at all strange that Daoyuan mentioned the Huiwan and Zhouling counties.

I now want to point out the latest historical fact recorded in the *Shui Jing Zhu* so that everyone knows that the writing of this immortal work by Li Daoyuan was probably completed in the author's later years, not far from his death—perhaps the book was not completely finished when he was murdered.

Li Daoyuan often tells us some biographical material about himself in his book. For example, in the Ru River section, he says:

"In the fourth year of the Yanchang era, I was appointed as the governor of Eastern Jingzhou."

The fourth year of the Yanchang era is equivalent to the fourteenth year of the Tianjian era (515), only twelve years before Daoyuan's death.

*Shui Jing Zhu* Volume 26, Shu River section:

"The Shu River flows south again, passing west of Jianling Mountain. During the Zhengguang era of the Wei Dynasty, when the King of Qi was stationed in Xuzhou, he built a large dam to divert the water westward. The Two Canals, where cities were established for defense, curved around Shushui. From the dam, it flows thirty li westward, pouring into the old course of the Shu River, which is called the New Canal." Here, "Jianling Mountain" was originally written as "Lingshan," and "Zhengguang" was written as "Zhengwan." Zhao Zai changed both of them to "Jianling Mountain" and "Zhengguang." Zhao's Zhu Jian Kan Wu 9, leaf 35, says:

"This is an event from the Zhengguang era of Emperor Xiaoming of the Tuoba Wei Dynasty. The King of Qi was Xiao Huan. The biography of Xiao Bin in the *History of Wei* says: 'During the Shengui era (518-519), he was appointed as the commander of military affairs for the two prefectures of Xu and Southern Yan, General of Chariots and Cavalry, and Governor of Xuzhou… In the second year of the Zhengguang era (521), he was summoned as the Grand General of Cavalry.'" The biography of Xiao Hui also mentions the construction of the dam, but not during the Zhengguang era. The biography says:

"When the Empress Dowager Ling came to power (the fourth year of the Zhengchang era, which is the fourteenth year of the Tianjian era, 515), [Xiao Bin] returned to the capital. Xiao Yan (Emperor Wu of Liang) sent his general Kang Xuan to dam the Huai River at Fushan to irrigate Yang and Xu. Xiao Bin was appointed as an imperial envoy, commander of all military affairs for the Eastern Expedition, and stationed in Pengcheng to attack him. At the beginning of the Xiping era, after the city was completed, the Huai River overflowed, causing a disaster for Pengcheng. Xiao Bin diverted the Huai River above the dam, and the water was slightly reduced."

According to Kang Xuan's biography in the *Book of Liang*, the Fushan dam project began in the twelfth year of the Tianjian era (the third year of the Yanchang era of the Wei Dynasty, 514) and was completed in the fourth month of the fifteenth year of the Tianjian era (the first year of the Xiping era, 516). That year, "in the autumn, in the eighth month, the Huai River flooded, and the dam was completely destroyed, flowing into the sea."

The record of the ninth year of the *History of Wei*, the Xiaoming Emperor's chronicle, clearly distinguishes two matters.

"In the fourth year of the Yanchang era (515), in the first month, Emperor Xiaoming ascended the throne. In the ninth month, the Empress Dowager personally took control of the government. In the ninth month, on the day of Guihai, an edict was issued… appointing Xiao Bin, the governor of Jizhou, as General Zhen Dong to dam the Huai River."

"In the first year of the Xiping era (516), in the second month, on the day of Yiwei, Zhen Dong Xiao Bin greatly defeated Xiao Yan's generals north of the Huai River… In the ninth month, on the day of Dingchou, the Huai dam broke, and over one hundred thousand people in the cities, garrisons, villages, and settlements along the Huai River were swept into the sea." Daoyuan was a contemporary witness and a geographer, so we should believe his record and determine that Xiao Bin's construction of the dam was not before the Fushan dam was destroyed, but after it; the event took place "during the Zhengguang era, when the King of Qi was stationed in Xuzhou," around the first year of the Zhengguang era (520). This is the latest historical event recorded in the *Shui Jing Zhu*. Seven years later, Li Daoyuan was murdered.

Xiao Hui murdered Li Daoyuan's entire family in the third year of the Xiaochang era (527). The *Shui Jing Zhu*, Huai River section, mentions the Fushan dam:

"The Huai River flows east again, passing Fushan, with the steep Stone Mountain facing it to the north. During the Tianjian era of the Liang Dynasty, a dam was built between the two mountains, violating the heart of heaven and the hopes of the people and gods, so it naturally collapsed."

This event was eleven years before Li Daoyuan's death. The *Shui Jing Zhu*, Shu River section, records "during the Zhengguang era, when the King of Qi was stationed in Xuzhou," which was six or seven years before Li Daoyuan's death. Li Daoyuan recorded these two events very clearly. The *History of Wei* mistakenly records two events that were four or five years apart as happening in the same period.

*Shui Jing Zhu* Volume 35, note says:

"The Ju River originates from Turtle Head Mountain and flows northwest, passing south of Yilong Garrison, the seat of Liang Dynasty's Ding Prefecture, where the barbarian chief Chu Xiu served as governor… The Ju River flows southwest again, passing east of the two prefectures of Si and Yu in the Liang Dynasty, where the barbarian chief Lu Lusheng served as governor, governing the Lake Slope City, also called the Water City."

According to the *Book of Liang* 22, biography of Xiao Xiu, Prince of Ancheng, in the thirteenth year of the Tianjian era (514), Xiao Xiu was appointed as an imperial envoy, attendant in ordinary service, commander of the military affairs of the three prefectures of Ying, Si, and Huo, General of the Western Pacification, and Governor of Ying Prefecture. The biography says:

"At that time, the barbarian chief Lu Lu rebelled in Si Prefecture, and his younger brother, Lu Xian, and Chao Xiu surrendered. Emperor Gaozu appointed Lu Lusheng as the governor of Northern Si Prefecture, Lu Xian as the governor of Northern Yu Prefecture, and Chao Xiu as the governor of Ding Prefecture, to defend the northern border. However, Lu Sheng and Chao Xiu slandered each other and had thoughts of leaving. Xiao Xiu soothed and accepted them, making use of their talents, and often relied on them." The *History of Wei* 9, Xiaoming Emperor's chronicle, has this entry for the fourth year of the Yanchang era (the fourteenth year of the Tianjian era, 515):

"In the eighth month… on the day of Gengchen, Xiao Yan's governor of Ding Prefecture, Chao Xiu, led three thousand followers to surrender."

This is what the *Book of Liang* refers to as "thoughts of leaving." The surrender of the Tian brothers, Lu Sheng and Lu Xian, and their appointment as governors of the three prefectures, was twelve or thirteen years before Li Daoyuan's death.

Li Daoyuan's most leisurely period seems to have been the time between when he was dismissed from his position as the governor of Eastern Jingzhou and returned to the capital and when he became the prefect of Henan. He served as the governor of Eastern Jingzhou in the fourth year of the Yanchang era (515); according to the biography of Zhao Su in the *Book of the Northern Zhou*, he became the prefect of Henan in the fifth year of the Zhengguang era (524). The *Shui Jing Zhu* does not contain any historical events after the beginning of the Zhengguang era. Perhaps this great book was written in a fit of passion after his dismissal and before his reappointment. (Revised draft on the nights of 3/7/3/8/3/9)

### Xin Jiaxuan's Demotion and Reinstatement in His Later Years

— Deng Guangming

—Supplement to the Chronological Biography of Jiaxuan—

The fourth year of the Jiatai era of Emperor Ningzong of Song (1204 AD) was precisely the era when Han Tuozhou was in power. In order to consolidate his power in the court, Han Tuozhou was eager to launch a war against foreign powers, hoping to establish a great achievement. At this time, the Southern Song Dynasty had been established in Jiangzuo for more than seventy years, and its military strength had always been insufficient to resist foreign tribes. When Emperor Xiaozong first ascended the throne, he had intended to restore the lost territories, but after Zhang Jun, Li Xianzong, and others were defeated by the Jin army at Fuliji in the first year of the Longxing era (1163), the entire country dared not propose the use of force against the Jin again. From then on, morale declined daily, and social customs became increasingly decadent. From the Longxing era of Emperor Xiaozong to the Jiatai era of Emperor Ningzong, procrastination and inertia had lasted for more than thirty years. People of ambition and determination who were eager to restore the lost territories were under this low-pressure atmosphere for a long time, and they could not bear their impatience and frustration. They desperately hoped that those in control of military and political power would come forward to change the situation. Since they knew that Han Tuozhou was eager to try, they were mostly willing to cooperate with him, rush to achieve success, so that national hatred could be slightly vented, and personal depression and feelings could be slightly expressed. At that time, public and private records (such as the Qingyuan Party Ban and the *Records of the Court and the Public Since the Jianyan Era*) all record that Jiaxuan entered the palace in the fourth year of the Jiatai era to meet Emperor Ningzong, presenting the benefits of using force, and also said that the Jin state would surely be in chaos and perish. He wished to entrust this matter to veteran ministers and strive to have a plan that could respond to sudden changes. Jiaxuan's active advocacy for the use of force against the Jin must have been out of the aforementioned state of mind.

Jiaxuan's proposal, because it was put forward at an appropriate time, had a great effect. According to historical records, Han Tuozhou was overjoyed and decided to challenge the Jin with force.

Before entering the palace to meet the emperor, Jiaxuan was serving as the prefect of Shaoxing and concurrently as the Pacification Commissioner of Zhejiang East Road. Shortly after the audience, he was changed to the prefect of Zhenjiang, and the purpose of this change was probably, as Liu Zhi said in his congratulatory letter to Jiaxuan, "Considering Jingkou, it is truly a border town."

Before taking office in Zhenjiang, Jiaxuan's official rank had just been promoted from Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices to Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Counsel. His additional post had also just been promoted from Compiler of the Jiying Hall to Attendant-in-Waiting of the Binge Pavilion. Jiaxuan was already sixty-five years old that year.

In the third month of the fourth year of the Jiatai era, Jiaxuan went to Zhenjiang to take office. After a full year, in the third month of the first year of the Kaixi era (1205), because of an incident of recommending the wrong person, Jiaxuan was "demoted for mistakenly recommending" and lost two ranks, from Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Counsel to Grand Master of the Court for Leisure. (According to the Song system: below Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Counsel was Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, and below Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices was Grand Master of the Court for Leisure).

The record of this matter in the biography of Jiaxuan in the *History of the Song Dynasty* is very brief, with only the eight characters "demoted to Grand Master of the Court for Leisure for mistakenly recommending," which does not allow us to know exactly what happened. In the eleventh record of Dismissals and Demotions in the *Song Huiyao* compiled by Xu Song, it is compared and said:

"[In the first year of the Kaixi era] On the second day of the third month, Xin Qiji, Attendant-in-Waiting of the Longtu Pavilion and prefect of Zhenjiang, was demoted by two ranks because Zhang Jing, a Secretarial Drafter, was illegal, and Qiji was responsible for mistakenly recommending him." Although the record here is slightly more detailed, the exact nature of Zhang Jing's illegal actions, which caused such an important figure as Jiaxuan, who was heavily relied upon by the court at the time, to be punished, remains unknown. What we particularly want to know is whether Jiaxuan was reinstated to his original rank after this demotion of two ranks. This question cannot be answered in the *History of the Song Dynasty*, the *Song Huiyao*, or in any of the miscellaneous histories and notes of the Song people. Therefore, when I wrote the "Chronological Biography of Xin Jiaxuan" (although this book was recently published by the Commercial Press, it is an old work of mine from ten years ago), I did not provide an answer to this question. Recently, after reading Cai Youxue's (Xingzhi) *Collected Works of the Yudetang Outer Edicts*, I finally found the answer to this question and learned that Jiaxuan was later reinstated as Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Counsel, and all of the edicts before and after were written by Cai Youxue.

I will now transcribe the two edicts related to Jiaxuan's reinstatement and roughly estimate their dates.

1. Edict reinstating Xin Qiji as Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices: "Recommending the virtuous and capable is the ambition of scholars; being held jointly liable for mistaken recommendations is an old law of the state. Although the law must be enforced, the circumstances may be understood. Official so-and-so has long been known for his outstanding qualities and has aspired to achieve fame. He was entrusted with important tasks during his tenure and was widely praised in several circuits. Having served for a long time, he has seen many people. How could his judgment have been so imprecise that he implicated himself in his recommendations? Therefore, he is granted amnesty and gradually restored to his previous official position. Knowing a person's benevolence through his mistakes, how can We continue to blame the past? Only by promoting the good will you be able to learn from the past. You must be more careful in the future." (Collected Works of the Yudetang Outer Edicts, Volume 1, leaf 2).

This edict is placed after the edict "Wu Zong Dismissed from Academician Expositor of the Longtu Pavilion" and before the edict "Cheng Song Settled in Lizhou". Wu Zong was dismissed from the Academician Expositorship of the Longtu Pavilion because of Wu Xi's rebellion. The *Song Huiyao* (6) under Penal Law records:

"[In the third year of the Kaixi era, third month] Twenty-seventh day, the Sichuan Capital Grand Tea and Horse Official Wu Zong said: 'The rebel Wu Xi did not fulfill his duties as a subject, betrayed the kindness of the country above, and betrayed his family below. I am related to his family and deserve to be punished ten thousand times. I respectfully await punishment at the palace gate with my son Zhao and others.' An edict ordered Wu Zong to be dismissed and released."

Cai's edict has phrases such as "Attaching to the execution of the great villain, pouring out sincerity and confessing guilt", which is aimed at Wu Zong's memorial requesting punishment. It can be seen that this edict was issued on the twenty-seventh day of the third month. According to the *History of the Song Dynasty* - Emperor Ningzong's Annals, Cheng Song was ordered to be the vice military commissioner of Shun Chang and settled in Lizhou on the Renyin day of the third month of the Kaixi era, The first day of the third month of this year was Bingzi, and Renyin was exactly the twenty-seventh day. Since Jiaxuan's edict reinstating Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices is located between the two, it can be known that it and the above two events must have been on the same day.

2. Edict reinstating Xin Qiji as Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Counsel: "We hope that the ministers in attendance will promote talents and work together to achieve great things. However, it is difficult to know a person, and there may be cases of mistaken recommendations, but their intentions can be discerned. Official so-and-so is highly talented and has been famous for generations. He was recently removed from his position of deliberation and is still under careful consideration. Due to a minor mistake, he has not yet been restored to his previous rank. However, We will not withhold the usual review. Strive to repay the country, and strive to promote the virtuous. Do not be discouraged by the punishment of one person, and do not hinder your ambition to promote talents. This is what We expect of you, please remember it." (Collected Works of the Yudetang Outer Edicts, Volume 1, leaf 12).

This edict is placed after the edict of "Zhao Chun appointed as the Jianghuai Pacification Commissioner" and before the edict of "Xiang Anshi removed from the post of Academician of the Longtu Pavilion". Now, according to the *History of the Song Dynasty* - Emperor Ningzong's Annals, Zhao Chun was appointed as the Deputy Commander of the Palace Guards and concurrently as the Jianghuai Pacification Commissioner on the Xinmao day of the ninth month of the third year of the Kaixi era; and according to the *Song Huiyao* (11) under Dismissals and Demotions of Officials, Xiang Anshi's removal from the post of Academician of the Longtu Pavilion was on the twenty-second day of the seventh month of this year. These two records in the *History of the Song Dynasty* and the *Song Huiyao* are clear and unambiguous, so I believe that the arrangement of these edicts in the *Collected Works of the Yudetang Outer Edicts* must have some inversions and omissions. Now, I will tentatively determine the date of Jiaxuan's reinstatement as Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Counsel based on the date of Xiang Anshi's removal from office, so the latest it should be is the twenty-second day of the seventh month. In the eighth month of this year, Jiaxuan had already fallen ill at home, and he passed away on the tenth day of the ninth month. We have no way of knowing whether he ever saw this edict while lying on his sickbed.

Although Jiaxuan was demoted by two ranks due to Zhang Jing's illegal actions, he continued to serve as the prefect of Zhenjiang and was not dismissed. His additional post was still Attendant-in-Waiting. On the nineteenth day of the sixth month of the first year of the Kaixi era, he was reassigned as the prefect of Longxing, but before he took office, he was impeached by an official and removed from his new post, changed to "Promoter of the Chongyou Taoist Temple," and returned to live in Qianshan in the autumn.

In the *History of the Song Dynasty* - Jiaxuan's Biography, after "Promoter of the Chongyou Taoist Temple," it continues, "Appointed as the prefect of Shaoxing, Pacification Commissioner of Zhejiang East Road, he declined the appointment. Promoted to Attendant-in-Waiting of the Huawen Pavilion, then promoted to Attendant-in-Waiting of the Longtu Pavilion. Appointed as the prefect of Jiangzhou, ordered to go to the imperial court for an interview, tried as Vice Minister of the Ministry of War, he declined the appointment." Although Jiaxuan did not take office in any of these appointments, it can be seen that the imperial court still relied heavily on him, so his official titles were gradually promoted to Attendant-in-Waiting of the Longtu Pavilion. However, even as they relied on him so heavily, they delayed in reinstating his demoted ranks. Was this because Zhang Jing's illegal actions were too serious, or was it because Song dynasty scholars only "regarded ascending to the cabinet and being promoted to the imperial guard as high-ranking officials, and did not regard the speed of promotion as honor or stagnation," and people in the court held this view, so they thought that Jiaxuan's reinstatement was insignificant and caused such a long delay? We have no way of answering this question either.

In the *Collected Works of the Yudetang Outer Edicts*, there is also an edict for "Jiaxuan Xin, Attendant-in-Waiting, to retire," which is even later. I will also transcribe it here:

"The edict granting the return of the ring is precisely for the need of talents; admiring the honor of the chariot, it is heard that he has resigned. Strive to follow your sincerity, and grant you special honors. Official so-and-so has keen insight and decisive action, and has long been known for his extraordinary talents; he has experienced hardships and has become more determined in his ambitions in his later years. He served Our ancestors with loyalty, and during Our reign, We entrusted him with important tasks and appointed him to high positions. Considering that his rest was not long ago, We still have great regard for him. We want him to be familiar with the border plans and enter the inner circle to receive confidential orders. How could he suddenly fall ill and request to resign? Therefore, We grant him the old rank and increase his new rank, to honor him and to give him rest. Without competition, We cherish the old minister; without medicine, We have joy, may he have longevity." (Volume 3, leaf 10.)

This edict is placed after the edict of "Zhao Shanxuan appointed as the prefect of Lin'an" and before the edict of "Zhao Shiheng appointed as the prefect of Zhenjiang". According to the *Chunxi Lin'an Zhi* - Rank of Officials, Zhao Shanxuan was appointed as the acting prefect of Lin'an with the title of Compiler of the Huawen Pavilion and the rank of Grand Master of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices and Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Works on the twenty-sixth day of the twelfth month of the third year of the Kaixi era; according to the *Jiading Zhenjiang Zhi* - Song Dynasty Prefects, Zhao Shiheng took office on the fifth day of the first month of the first year of the Jiading era (1208). Jiaxuan's retirement is located between the two, so it is known that the event was either at the end of the third year of the Kaixi era or at the beginning of the first year of the Jiading era, when Jiaxuan had passed away for more than one hundred days. It is likely that Jiaxuan had submitted a memorial requesting retirement when he was seriously ill, and by the time the memorial reached the court, he may have already passed away. After a long process of "official document travel" in between, it was inevitably delayed for three or four months.

### On the Translation of the Southern Transmission Tripitaka

— Ji Xianlin

A few days ago, a friend sent me from Shanghai six volumes of the Southern Transmission Tripitaka, printed by the Universal Buddhist Tripitaka Publication Society. Two of them are the Long Discourses, originally named Dighanikaya, equivalent to the Dirghagama in the Chinese Tripitaka. The translator, Jiang Baibo, translated it based on a Japanese translation. One volume is the Middle Length Discourses, originally named Majjhimaikaya, equivalent to the Madhyamagama in the Chinese Tripitaka. The translator, Shramana Zhifeng, also translated it based on a Japanese translation. Two volumes are the Jataka tales from the Minor Collection (Khuddakanikaya). The translator, Xia Gaizun, also translated it based on a Japanese translation. The last volume is the Conditional Relations (Patthanapakarana or Mfahapakrana) of the Abhidhamma Pitaka (Book of Analysis), the topic is similar to the Northern Transmission's Jñānaprasthāna (Taishō Tripiṭaka No. 1544); however, the content and form are different. The translator, Fan Jidong, still translated it based on a Japanese translation. It is said that the original plan of the Universal Buddhist Tripitaka Publication Society was to translate the entire Southern Transmission Tripitaka from Japanese translations. However, due to various reasons, this great plan has only realized a very small portion to date: it seems that only these six volumes have been printed. Although not many books have been published, this plan is very meaningful, and the courage alone is worthy of our admiration. In addition to admiration for the publication of this book, I also have some opinions, which I will now write down in a rambling manner.

Let's first talk about the term "Southern Transmission". "Southern" is in contrast to "Northern". "Northern" refers to the Sanskrit or mixed-text Tripitaka. "Southern" refers to the Pali Tripitaka. Not only do Chinese scholars divide it this way, but foreign scholars do as well. The current Pali Tripitaka is indeed prevalent in Sri Lanka in the South, and the Tripitaka written in Siamese script also spread from Sri Lanka. It seems that we have no reason to deny the correctness of the term "Southern Transmission". However, if we return to history and study the distribution of the Pali Tripitaka, we will immediately feel that the term "Southern Transmission" is problematic. First of all, Pali is not a southern dialect. The origin of Pali is very complex, and we still dare not say that we have solved all the linguistic problems related to Pali. But in general, we can say that Pali is a western dialect, because many grammatical features are similar to the (Girnar) dialect in the Edicts of Ashoka. Scholars researching from the perspective of the inscriptions can also prove that the old home of Pali is in the central to western part of the Vindhya Mountains. Although there are many traces of eastern dialects in it, these are all preserved from the original Magadhi scriptures. How could such a western dialect scripture flow to Sri Lanka in the South? We have no historical materials to explain this matter, so we have to resort to legends. According to legend, Ashoka's younger brother or son, Mahinda, brought this Pali Tripitaka to Sri Lanka, and flew there from the air. We certainly cannot believe such legends; however, this legend may suggest a historical fact: that this scripture was brought to Sri Lanka by eminent monks who went south to preach during the reign of the Buddhist Dharma King Ashoka. Regardless of how the scripture was transmitted, its original home was definitely not in the South. Therefore, I feel that the term "Southern Transmission" is not very appropriate, and we should change it, or simply call it the Pali Tripitaka.

Now let's talk about the issue of translation. These volumes that have already been printed are all re-translated from Japanese translations. I have always opposed re-translation, because I feel that translation is already a last resort. No matter what language is translated into what language, no matter how high the translator's skills are, the style, charm, and even the meaning of the original text cannot be completely preserved in the translation, let alone re-translation? There are many very famous translations in the world, such as Fitzgeralcl's translation of the Rubaiyat, and Shlegl and Tieck's German translations of Shakespeare; however, if you study them carefully, these translations are famous entirely because of the exquisiteness of the translation, not because the translation captures the charm and style of the original text. These translations are actually creations, and the original text only provides the inspiration for creation. I also dare not approve of re-translating the Pali Tripitaka from Japanese. Japanese and Pali are very different in sentence structure. Even English, German, and French, which belong to the same language family as Pali, cannot faithfully retain the style and sentence structure of the original text, let alone Japanese? Now let's just give one example: Jataka No. 38, originally named Baka-Jataka (Heron Jataka), contains a poem. I will now write the original text below:

Naccanta nikatippannonikatya sukham edhati

Aradhe nikatippanno bako kakkata-m-iva'ti

The direct translation is:

One skilled in deceit cannot always benefit from deceit,

Just like the deceitful heron received from the crab.

The meaning is that although a person skilled in deceit can sometimes benefit from deceit, there will always be retribution one day. The deceitful heron being punished by the crab is an example. The original text has two lines, each with sixteen syllables. Each line can be divided into two halves (Pada), each Pada with eight syllables. There is a bit of a grammatical problem in the second line, and it seems that it needs to be supplemented to be clear.

Let's look at the translation now. I don't have the Japanese translation at hand, so I can only look at the Chinese translation translated from the Japanese translation:

One skilled in deceit, because of deceit

Cannot permanently plan, like deceit to receive ( ).

Each line is divided into two sections, probably to represent the Pada of the original text. However, it failed, because the first and second Pada of the original text have become three sections here, and the last two Pada have been reduced to one section. Furthermore, in terms of meaning, there also seems to be a mistake: the translator seems to be saying that it is because of deceit that one cannot prosper permanently, which does not match the meaning of the original text. Let's look at the English translation:

Guile profits not you very guileful folk

Mark what the guilefulcrane got from the crabf 1

This translation is too free, adding several words for no reason that are not in the original text, and the tone is completely different from the original text. Compared with the English translation and the Japanese translation, I think the Japanese translation is more faithful to the original text. If someone translates the Jataka from the English translation, I am afraid it will be even further from the original text.

I said above that the second line seems to have some problems. There are many places like this with problems in the Pali Tripitaka, mostly because the transmission time has been too long, and there are bound to be errors in transcription. Take the Jataka for example, there are many problems inside. The edition collated and printed by Fausboll is recognized as a masterpiece; however, it still leaves many difficult problems unresolved. The English version evaluated by the famous British Sanskrit scholar Cuwell and a large group of Sanskrit scholars, and the text version translated by Dutrroit, cannot fully satisfy us, and some places are often far-fetched. Therefore, whoever wants to translate the Pali scriptures must conduct precise research on the original text, and his translation will represent his attainments in Pali research. When translating, in addition to the most common publication of the Pali Text Society, one should also consult the Tripitaka in Siamese script, because the Tripitaka in Siamese script is sometimes better than the commonly published edition, and the wording is closer to the ancient version in some places. Although Japanese scholars already know how to use the Tripitaka in Siamese script, Japanese scholars' research achievements in Pali are not particularly outstanding. Using not-so-outstanding achievements to do such a difficult work, some places are inevitably far-fetched, which is also expected. Therefore, I believe that many difficulties in wording in the Pali Tripitaka may not all be satisfactorily resolved in the Japanese translation. Now we actually want to re-translate such a book in its entirety, isn't it a bit of a thankless task? We don't have many experts working in this area right now, so of course we can't talk about being able to directly translate the entire Tripitaka from Pali; however, we might as well start with small things, as many people as we have, translate as much as we can, and slowly add to it. Many years later, maybe we can directly translate the entire Pali Tripitaka. Even if we can only translate one volume right now, that one volume can also represent our true ability, which is always better than re-translating a foreign language translation. Perhaps some people will say: if we do this, we don't know how long we will have to wait to see the translation of the entire Pali Tripitaka. But what does that matter? I still believe to this day that one should adhere to the spirit of "rather have quality over quantity" when doing scholarship.

I have said a lot above, and it seems that I am not satisfied with the Pali Tripitaka printed by the Universal Wisdom Tripitaka Publication Society. Actually, it's not like that, I very much admire this spirit. I only hope that Chinese scholars can go further, so I said a lot. My intention is to give encouragement to scholars, so that they do not waste their energy, that's all. (Evening of March 4th, at Peking University)

### Talking About Illusions

— Shi Yu

If you put your index finger on your forehead and then shake your head with your eyes closed, you will feel that it is your finger that is moving. If you look at a straight stick as bent through a refractive glass, when you touch it with your hand, you will also feel that it is bent. If you are sitting in the express train of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, if you close your eyes and sit facing away from the direction the train is traveling, you will feel that the train is moving in the opposite direction. A truly perfect square does not look very square, and if the width is slightly wider, it will look more like a square. Two straight lines of equal length look longer when placed vertically than when placed horizontally.

A dog barks wildly at its own reflection in the water; a sparrow flies high when it sees a scarecrow in the field. Humans are also like this, we live in illusions. The earth is constantly rotating, but we never feel it; the river flows, the scenery moves but the boat does not, that is the same principle. A color-blind person can see a red flower as blue. A sensitive person can see the white clouds in the sky as a grey dog. When the old Russian Empress Catherine was touring Siberia, local officials used paper houses to decorate the roadside. The Empress rejoiced, saying: "Is Siberia so beautiful?" The Empress lived in an illusion.

I don't know where the saying comes from that peanuts and dried tofu taste like ham when eaten together. But psychologists have indeed told us that the sense of taste is the easiest to cause illusions. If you pinch your nostrils and close your eyes, then margarine and butter taste the same, and you can't even tell the difference between chicken, beef, and pork. You can't even tell the difference between tomato soup and onion soup.

Merchants are the most adept at using illusions. If you stroll on Jing'an Temple Road, try to pay attention to the prices marked in the windows on both sides, and you will rarely see whole numbers. The owner of a shoe store will mark a pair of leather shoes at "$87,975,000" instead of directly marking "$2,000,000". Because of the customer's illusion, they feel that nine dimes and nine cents is cheaper than one dollar by less than one cent. Whole numbers are enough to create a "hurdle" feeling. When the price of rice rises from 2.5 million to 2.9 million, it is not very exciting, but when it rises to 3.01 million, we jump up: "We broke the 3 million mark--"

Psychologists tell us that our daily observations are almost always wrong. A piece of paper looks square from the front; from the side it looks like a line. We often only see one side of things when we observe general things, and ignore the other aspects. There is a famous story of a blind man touching an elephant: it says that when the blind man touched the back of the elephant, he thought the elephant was a wall; when he touched the elephant's nose, he thought it was a snake; when he touched the elephant's leg, he thought the elephant was a pillar. Abstract things are the easiest to cause illusions. A child asked his father:

"What is air?"

"Air is something that is invisible, odorless, and tasteless."

"How is it colorless, odorless, and tasteless?"

"It's as colorless as glass, as odorless and tasteless as plain boiled water!"

"I see! Air is like a glass cup!"

Errors in observation can be partly attributed to "emotion". People say: "You are too emotional!" Human nature always overestimates what it likes and underestimates what it dislikes. Daiyu's tuberculosis is seen as a kind of beauty by Baoyu, and the intelligence of yellow people is seen as a waste by white people. You feel that this thing is right because the person you admire or respect feels that the thing is right. When George Bernard Shaw felt that the death penalty should not be abolished, many British people also felt that the death penalty should not be abolished. If ancient rulers wanted to eat phoenix livers, they would just eat them; if modern rulers want to eat phoenix stomachs, they must first create a set of public opinions to make people have the mistaken idea that "rulers must eat phoenix livers", and then eat them out of necessity, just like a gambler who can deal himself the last ace while keeping people in the dark.

Prejudice and superstition are a kind of illusion, or at least a partial illusion. Astrologers bless your future because you are born with phoenix eyes and broad forehead, and a full tip of the nose. But if you are born with a catfish mouth, bat ears, or uneven face, or a face with five peaks that are not full, then your future will be full of twists and turns. It is said that seeing someone's funeral is unlucky. Dreaming of a coffin, holding an umbrella in the house, seeing the water receding, the sun setting, or the last half moon, are all unlucky. When a bird flies away from the church during a wedding, it is a bad omen; when a dog cries with its head down when someone is sick, misfortune is coming. Psychologists have studied this kind of prejudice and superstition and found that it is completely a human illusion. This kind of faulty logic is often formed because of the accidental association of certain things. We feel that thirteen is an unlucky number because Christ's last supper was with thirteen people, and Christ was crucified on the cross. Emperor Taizu of Ming had a pointed chin, so people said that pointed chins have the appearance of emperors. A long time ago, a patient happened to die when an owl was hooting sadly, so people said that an owl hooting when someone is sick is an unlucky omen. These are coincidences that create human illusions. Emerson said: "Superstition is born of ignorance." If we live in illusion, we also live in ignorance!

### Breakfast

— Yu Wen

I came to Shanghai in 1938 and lived in a small room attached to a studio in a large building. Because I had to go out to teach in the morning and rush back to do my own work in the afternoon, the most important thing to do in the morning was to eat. At that time, the most ideal breakfast was ten scallion oil crab shell pastries for one dime or hot steamed meat buns, which were cheap and delicious, and incomparable. After eating, I couldn't help but feel satisfied and greatly interested in life.

A few days ago, I passed by a rarely walked stone street because of something, and saw freshly baked crab shell pastries on a pancake stall. I suddenly felt hungry, so I asked the price. The stall owner raised five fingers and said, "Five thousand each". I had to buy two within my means and ate them as I walked. Although the flavor of this pastry has not diminished compared to those days, I always feel that what comes through the layer of crisp fragrance is a kind of bitter, deep-seated taste. As for the feeling of being "greatly interested in life" when eating the most basic breakfast ten years ago, it is no longer possible to grasp.

I don't remember the exact date when my breakfast started to say goodbye to me. To put it vaguely, it was probably when I was working as a daily newspaper editor. Since then, I have never been able to appreciate the little beauty in the little poverty of the "lodger" period in the studio.

### On Jumping Off Buildings

— He Ku

There are many traditional Chinese methods of suicide, such as slitting one's throat, hanging oneself, jumping into a well, and jumping off a building. Jumping off a building is the most tragic suicide method. This kind of tragic death involves brains splattered and flesh blurred. "It is difficult throughout the ages to die only once", jumping off a building to die is the most difficult of the difficult. There was a woman in Chinese history who was famous for falling from a building, she was Green Pearl, the concubine of Shi Chong of Jin Dynasty. Green Pearl's beauty aroused Sun Xiu's covetousness, and he did not hesitate to falsely create an imperial edict from the old emperor to imprison Chong in order to seize the beauty. As a result, Green Pearl was unwilling to succumb to violence and committed suicide by jumping off the building.

There are many people who commit suicide due to political failure. After the collapse of the Nazi regime, Hitler's whereabouts are still a mystery. Rumors say that he took poison and then destroyed the body to eliminate traces. Since there is no factual evidence, it has become a mystery, so let's leave it aside. Göring committed suicide by taking potassium cyanide on the eve of being sentenced to hanging, which can be regarded as the most cowardly suicide, which is too far removed from his style when he was a powerful figure. The Japanese former Prime Minister Tojo's suicide with a pistol was just a pose, close to a woman's disheveled hair and weeping, shouting and scolding in the street, used as a basis for shamelessness when the Far East Court interrogated him today. As for those who use jumping off a building to commit suicide as a way to retire bravely due to political disagreements, of course we have to refer to the reported suicide of the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Masaryk the day before yesterday. The Reuters telegram reported from London, of course, greatly praised Masaryk, "Democratic people here believe that Masaryk's death is tantamount to making the final protest against the Czech coup d'état twenty-one days ago." My personal view is to abandon the complex political factors and praise his decisive and heroic act on the eve of his death, which is worthy of unanimous praise by the world. Masaryk's political views were contrary to those of the Czech government after the coup. In order to avoid inner pain, he was willing to sacrifice his life for the cause. This act is close to the Buddhist spirit of "sacrificing oneself to feed a hungry tiger"; of course, I say it is "close to" this spirit, and it is not really completely in line with sacrificing oneself to feed a tiger.

Chinese people have always followed the Confucian doctrine of the golden mean on the issue of different political views: "If the Way is not practiced, take a raft and float on the sea." What is meant is to disappear into the mountains and forests. This is a path from engaging in the world to leaving the world. Westerners are willing to sacrifice themselves, and sacrificing oneself to the point of falling from a building is to return to the world from engaging in the world. Why is that? He is unwilling to succumb to the new environment, and in his soul he only adheres to the old traditions. Since he cannot resist the trend, he only has the path of "embracing the bright moon and ending his life", concealing himself in the invisible for the sake of his faith, so he is still engaged in the world.

This tragic method of death may not be enough to encourage the decadent customs, but what can be explained is that Masaryk sacrificed himself for his freedom of thought and freedom of belief.

### A Warning

— Ran Ran

The situation these days, we seem to be watching a movie.

The first shot is a large $ sign, followed by a loud noise on the screen, and the $ sign is broken into many pieces. After a while, it is put together again to form a whole, but it is much smaller than the original $ sign. My metaphor is very superficial, but everyone must know its meaning, because in fact, it can be said that we are both the audience and the protagonist. Except for a few lucky ones, the situation of ordinary people, especially salaried workers, is very embarrassing. The banknotes in our pockets or the monthly income have been reduced by 30%, 40%...for no reason.

Leaving aside the economic losses, I think the psychological impact must be great, and it is enough to affect the working mood of ordinary people. May I ask someone across the street, two or three days ago, bought five boxes of solid soap, each box costing more than four million yuan, and now it has risen to more than four million six hundred thousand yuan per box. In one turn of the hand, without spending half a bit of brainpower or spending a cent of physical strength, he enjoys a profit of more than two million yuan. On the other hand, someone is working a small job in a certain organization, working hard all day long, and the average daily income is only 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Under such circumstances, wouldn't it make those who are burying their heads in work "discouraged" and flock to the path of "hoarders"! If you can't buy whole boxes or whole packages, then just buy a few pieces of soap and a few boxes of matches. As a result, perhaps before an "economic crisis" occurs, the paralysis of people's hearts is enough to destroy the mood for construction.

In fact, it depends on people. The situation of inflation in the United States is also very bad. But they have their own coping methods.

The first is to withdraw funds from circulation, and banks restrict loans. There is no way to transfer funds to buy goods, and prices are bound to be unable to rise. The question is how to use the surplus deposits after banks restrict loans, which requires careful consideration.

The second is that the supply of goods is not easy to increase in the short term, so we can only start with controlling the market and buying households.

The above is a lesson from other countries, or it can be used to attack the current "mistakes".

### Frozen Cake

— Mao Yi

Ever since Gordon Merl entered the pastry industry at the age of twenty-two, he has been dreaming of opening a pastry shop without ovens. Today, he is the owner of the most unusual pastry shop in the United States, his products are not baked, but frozen!

There are two hundred stores across the United States that sell the frozen steamed buns, cakes, rolls, and pastries he makes. Customers only need to bake them in the oven when they buy them home.

This new method of making pastries solves the problem of how modern housewives can bake themselves with the least amount of trouble. A "frozen cake" can be kept in a household refrigerator for several days without the risk of losing its flavor, becoming hard, or spoiling.

Merl is confident that he runs the world's first and only pastry shop without ovens. This shop is located in Oak Park Village, west of Chicago. The village has a population of nearly 70,000 and is the largest village in the United States.

Merl's frozen cakes are now selling well all over the United States. These pastries are all made by specialized chefs, placed in cardboard boxes, in portions suitable for household use, and frozen in refrigerators at minus ten degrees. Like transporting ice cream, they are transported in refrigerator trucks to the refrigerators of retailers, and then sold to customers.

One of the main reasons why cakes are popular with housewives is their freshness. Pastries sold in general stores have been out of the oven for at least several hours, and some have been out of the oven for a day or two. If you buy a frozen cake and bake it in the oven, it will be the same as a fresh one. Another advantage is saving energy and time. Housewives don't need to mix flour, add seasonings, or ferment, they only need to bake it. After the frozen bread rolls are baked, their volume can double, and the fermentation performance is not damaged by freezing at all.

Merl hated getting up to work at 3:30 every morning and standing in front of a hot oven for long periods of time, regardless of winter or summer, so he thought of making frozen cakes, and his creation has indeed made it easier for many housewives.

### Poetry Records of Haihong Building

— Xu Banmeng

Untitled

Coming is yearning, going is sorrow, riding a crane to Yangzhou in light clothes, red cotton fine frames lock spring, green powder secluded branches hook butterflies at noon, in vain I am sad and throw away the brocade zither, I push him to repeatedly kick the fragrant swing, the fairy spring has no news after all, surpassing the twelve buildings of Jiangnan.

Clouds stretch across the northern border, rain falls in the south, phoenixes fly together, pulling at parting thoughts, I can offer red butter to tease the jade rabbit, I am ashamed that I have no white dregs to pour for the golden cicada, the deep love that crosses the sea is hard to fill, the tears that have dried up in the Xiang River cannot be expressed, when I suddenly meet an envoy from Qingdao, I earnestly persuade him to pluck the seven strings.

Parting Thoughts

Morning makeup opens by the tulip hall, disorderly and numerous flowers are planted in order, the Chang'e who enters the moon falsely occupies the round palace, carrying the rain the goddess mistakenly ascends the Yangtai; I hate the leaf-healing hibiscus mirror, I hug the fragrant cardamom bud in death, I do not believe that there is parting in the world, I invite you to drink a cup together on horseback.

Dharma Talk Verse

The road was originally just one, why distinguish between emphasis and light tapping. The Dharma talk from the East has few words, it only scratches where my heart itches.

### Lincoln's Beard

— Lei Ying

Of all the portraits or photographs we see of Lincoln, none are without a beard encircling his cheeks. Coupled with his voluminous hair, gaunt face, and kind yet slightly melancholic gaze, the overall impression he gives us is a blend of solemnity and approachability.

However, when he was nominated as the Republican candidate for president in 1860, his chin was still a barren expanse of bare skin.

What prompted him to grow a beard was an eleven-year-old girl.

At that time, the news of Lincoln's nomination reached New York. The New York publisher, Hus, immediately sent a painter named Shes to visit Lincoln in Illinois to paint a half-length, side-view portrait of him. This was the first portrait of Lincoln's life, showing him wearing a dark black formal suit, set against a blue-gray background, his expression solemn and pensive – but his chin was bare, lacking any flourish.

This portrait was reproduced and distributed for Lincoln's campaign. That year's election was extremely heated, with even children dividing into parties and enthusiastically discussing the merits of the candidates. In Westfield, New York, an eleven-year-old girl named Grace Bedell supported Lincoln for president, but after carefully studying Lincoln's portrait, she suddenly noticed Lincoln's flaw...

That autumn, Lincoln was busy with his campaign, receiving countless letters every day. Suddenly, one letter caught his attention. The letter contained many grammatical errors, and even slightly misspelled Lincoln's name, but the content was filled with earnest concern. The letter said:

"Mr. Lincoln: My father just came home from the market and brought back your portrait. I am an eleven-year-old girl, but I really hope you can be the President of the United States, so I am writing to you now, hoping you won't mind? I don't know if you have a daughter the same age as me, if you do, please send my regards to her on my behalf. If you don't have time to write back to me, please have her do it for you. I have four brothers, some of whom want to vote for you, but if you would grow a little beard, then I will definitely persuade them to vote for you unanimously. Your face is very thin, growing a beard would definitely make you look better than you do now. Women all like men with beards, and if you grow a beard, they will definitely pressure their husbands to vote for you. My father will definitely vote for you, and if I were a man, I would definitely vote for you..."

The letter was signed "Grace Bedell".

In reality, fashionable people at that time did not wear beards, but the concern in this letter deeply moved Lincoln. Three days later, Lincoln wrote a reply to Grace:

"Dear little girl: Your lovely letter has been received. Unfortunately, I don't have a daughter. I have three sons – one seventeen, one nine, and one seven. Including me and their mother, that's my whole family. As for the beard, I have never grown one before. If I were to grow one now, do you think people would say I'm being pretentious?"

However, Lincoln actually grew a beard. By the time he traveled from his hometown in Illinois to Washington to take office as president the following year, his beard was already quite impressive.

Lincoln did not forget the little girl. When his special train passed through Westfield, New York, the train station was as usual, crowded with people welcoming him. Grace arrived at the station early in the morning, her hair neatly done, wearing her prettiest clothes, and holding a bouquet of flowers tightly in her hand. However, as more and more people arrived, she was gradually pushed far away. She could hear Lincoln's speech, but her view was blocked by adults, and no matter how hard she tried to see if the great man had grown a beard, she couldn't see Lincoln's face.

As Lincoln's speech gradually drew to a close, Grace's heart grew heavy: perhaps he would just hop on the train and leave Westfield like this, and it would be difficult for her to see him again.

But Lincoln suddenly asked loudly, "There is a friend here who I have corresponded with. If she is here, I would like to meet her."

No one stood up to answer him.

A voice rose from the crowd: "Who? Who? What's her name?" "Her name is Grace Bedell. She wrote to me and said that I would look better if I grew a beard."

Amidst laughter, Grace was led to Lincoln. Lincoln stepped down from the platform and shook hands with the little girl. Then, he kissed her.

Pointing to his beard, he said to her, "Grace, I took your advice and grew a beard."

The Grace of that time later became Mrs. George Billings. Recalling the events of that day, she said, "The president's actions were so unexpected that I was embarrassed and quickly ran home, avoiding carriages on the road as much as possible. At one point, I even crawled under a carriage. When I got home, I suddenly remembered that the bouquet of roses in my hand was originally meant to be presented to him, but I had completely forgotten about it when I saw him. Looking closely, I realized that all that remained in my hand were a few flower stems."

The newspapers at the time widely publicized this event, with The New York Tribune running the headline "Beautiful Girl Kisses President"; The St. Louis Republican jokingly said that if kissing girls was one of the president's privileges, then Mrs. Lincoln, in order to safeguard her own rights, should strive for a veto in this regard.

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 12: A Chance Encounter (96)

Qi Wan quickly turned her head and saw Niao Yun wearing an overcoat, holding a cane in one hand, walking over from the east side. Qi Wan was delighted to see him, as if she had something to ask him, but when Niao Yun stood in front of her, she felt unable to say anything, and only blankly asked: "Where is Mr. Liu going?" Niao Yun took off his otter fur hat, saying, "I've been running around all day, but I haven't achieved anything. It's infuriating!" Qi Wan said, "What are you so busy with, Mr. Liu? Can you tell me?" Chun Yun said, "The main reason for my coming to Beiping this time is to find a few good actors to cooperate with my upcoming film. Before I came to Beiping, I had already contacted a few friends in Beiping, and there were a few young ladies who seemed interested in joining the silver screen and showing off their talents. But not long after I arrived in Beiping, I fell ill and stayed in this hospital for more than half a month. Now that I've recovered, the hospital has allowed me to go out and walk around. Today I went to find the friends who originally introduced me to these young ladies and contacted them, but some of them were in school, and others had already been hired by theater groups. Judging from this situation, I'm afraid my plans will fall through." As he spoke, he looked very disappointed. Qi Wan heard this and couldn't help but feel a stir in her heart, asking, "What are you going to do now?" Niao Yun said, "I'll have to find another way!" Qi Wan said, "Are you looking for these young ladies to play the lead roles in the film?" Dao Yun said, "I can't say for sure yet, it will depend on meeting them first. It's really not easy to find a suitable talent." Qi Wan said, "Can someone with my qualifications appear on the silver screen?" Wu Yun heard this and said with surprise and joy, "It would be wonderful if Miss Gu would appear on the silver screen!" Qi Wan said, "Really?" Dao Yun said, "With Miss Gu's dancing experience, she's more than qualified to be under the spotlight. Besides, as long as the name Gu Qi Wan appears on the film, it will shake society!" As he spoke, he smiled slightly. Qi Wan lowered her head and said nothing. Niao Yun took a step closer and said, "It's too windy here, Miss Gu has just recovered, please come inside and let's discuss it further." Qi Wan nodded and went to the room with Dao Yun. Niao Yun said, "Just now Miss Gu said she wanted to dedicate herself to the silver screen, I wonder if she really has this plan?" Qi Wan said, "This is my hope, but I'm afraid my abilities aren't up to par." Dao Yun said, "As long as Miss Gu is interested in this path, there's no way she won't succeed." Qi Wan said, "If Mr. Liu thinks it's possible, I must give it a try." Dao Yun said, "I am very grateful for Miss Gu's help. What I mean is, I want to further cooperate with each other." Qi Wan was stunned when she suddenly heard this sentence.

### Mother is Old, Son is Young, Livelihood is Gone – Introduction to Mrs. Wang

To the esteemed editor: My husband, Wang Shiqing, is thirty-four years old this year. He left home for Shanghai in the early stages of the War of Resistance to make a living, and has never returned since. However, he used to correspond by letter, but in 1941, all communication suddenly ceased. Some say he is wandering in other provinces, others say his whereabouts are unknown. In short, it has been seven years, and there has been no news. Although we have searched in many ways, we do not know his whereabouts, and it is difficult to determine whether he is alive or dead. At home, there is an elderly mother above and a weak wife and young children below. Amidst this high cost of living, the family's livelihood is cut off, and we live each day like a year, feeling lonely and miserable. The mother grieves for her son, the wife yearns for her husband, and the mother-in-law and child weep with tears all day long. We have long admired your newspaper for serving the public, and we earnestly request that you lend us a corner of your social services column to publish this information, so that we may be able to reunite our family and be grateful forever! With this request, Shou Wangshi of Huashe Town, Shaoxing, respectfully presents.

### Forwarded Mail

To Mr. Ma Peiyuan: This column received a letter from reader Ma Peidi, which states: "I read the marriage announcement advertisement in the Shen Bao on December 21, 1947, and the person involved is Mr. Ma Peiyuan. I am originally from Sui County and a follower of Islam. When my sixth paternal uncle, Fo Qiao, compiled the family genealogy in 1941, the name of my cousin Peiyuan was printed on it, as the eldest son of my distant uncle Zhen He (Zhen Hai). It was also noted that he had moved to Qingjiangpu, Jiangsu Province, so this Mr. Ma may be my cousin. My mailing address is 50 Xishi Street, Kaifeng City. Please ask your newspaper to find a way to inform him." We are forwarding this notification to you, hoping you will investigate. (Editor)
