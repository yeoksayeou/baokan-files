### Enhance National Confidence, Strengthen National Defense and Self-Defense Capabilities, Zeng Qi Encourages the People to Unite and Work Hard to Save the Nation and Build the Country

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 9th] Zeng Qi, a leader of the Chinese Youth Party, recently gave a speech on National Day, saying: "I have always believed that a third world war is inevitable and that a second national crisis will eventually come. Therefore, after the victory, I have repeatedly tried to persuade the people of the country with alarming and bitter words. Today, the internal and external situation is becoming increasingly serious, and my words will unfortunately be gradually confirmed. On this National Day, I would like to present my views to the people of the country for correction: (1) I have always believed that the Chinese nation is the most outstanding nation in the world. However, although its essence is excellent, its manifestations are close to decline. Without major stimulation, it cannot be awakened and excited. For example, during World War I, we disregarded Japan's constraints and resolutely participated in the European war, and finally recovered the Shandong Peninsula. This is proof of stimulation and awakening. During World War II, we fought against Japan alone for more than four years and finally mobilized the world, creating a 'democratic front' and overthrowing 'totalitarian countries.' This is another proof of stimulation and awakening. Although the Third World War has not yet broken out on the surface, we are actually standing on the front line and will inevitably endure a period of bitter struggle alone. Then, with 'the support of those who have the Tao,' we will achieve final victory. This is what I dare to assert. (2) Since national disaster is inevitable, we should prepare for a rainy day and not be discouraged by difficulties, nor should we retreat due to difficulties. In particular, we must not 'blame heaven and others,' simply attributing the blame to any person or any faction, without ourselves bearing any responsibility. This is not the attitude that modern citizens should have. I believe that there are three things that the people of the country should strive for together: (1) Enhance national self-confidence, (2) Strengthen national defense and self-defense capabilities, (3) Increase national unity. If these three things can be done, any internal and external troubles are not to be feared. I hope that the people of the country, under the leadership of the head of state, will work together on the 'non-partisan movement to save the nation and build the country,' without being negligent or reckless, but continuing to work hard, abiding by the law, being practical and realistic, reversing decline and promoting revival, and turning weakness into strength. Then, future National Days will definitely have a place where people can be sincerely happy, and will not spend this festival with a 'melancholy mood.'"

Moreover, there are a total of 1,070 money houses in the country, with more than 700 in the interior. The deadline for completing the capital increase within two months is even more difficult in reality. Please give them the same six-month deadline as ordinary industrial and commercial enterprises. (2) Request the government to consider the economic environment in various regions and reduce the minimum limit for capital increase. (3) The period of three months for depositing cash for capital increase into the Central Bank should be exempted from freezing. (4) Request that the interest rate on deposits and loans not be rigidly stipulated, so that various regions can make flexible increases and decreases based on local conditions.

The chairmen of the money industry associations in various regions reported the different situations in their respective regions. After talking for about an hour, Vice Minister Xu said that he would report the points requested by Qianlian to the Executive Yuan and discuss them with the responsible persons in the ministry.

Regarding the extension of the capital increase deadline, Xu said that the two-month deadline could be calculated from the date of receipt of the document. The remaining unanswered questions will be scheduled for another meeting with the representatives at 11:00 AM on the 11th to give a concrete reply. At 4:00 PM, Qin Runqing and others went to the Executive Yuan to petition again and were received by Secretary-General Li Weiguo. Li said that President Weng had received Vice Minister Xu's report.

The 7th and 8th Columns once broke into Wucun, south of Taiyuan, but were quickly defeated by the National Army. The National Army at other strongholds is also responding steadily.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 9th] The outer perimeter of Bingyuan is relatively peaceful west of the city, but there is fierce fighting in all other directions within 20 li.

### Ambassador Gu, Invited by U.S. State Department, Broadcasts to the Nation; Explains American Sentiment Towards China, Reviews Aid to China; Emphasizes Importance of Self-Help and Reform

[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] On the eve of our National Day, our Ambassador to the United States, Gu Weijun, at the invitation of the U.S. State Department, broadcast to the people of our country on the "Voice of America" radio station in New York, explaining the sentiment of Americans towards China and reviewing the entire issue of aid to China. Gu stated that if China fully utilizes American aid and engages in reform with a spirit of self-help, then American aid will surely continue to flow in. Gu emphasized that self-help and reform are the basic conditions for continuing to seek American aid. He said that China, under the leadership of President Chiang and the government, is gradually engaging in various reforms, such as military reform, monetary reform, and rural reform. This reform has attracted the attention and sympathy of the United States. The United States hopes that we will continue to work hard, because such reform can not only benefit China at present, but also serve as good debating material for our American friends when the U.S. Congress discusses foreign aid again next year. American officials have gradually understood the problem of the Chinese Communist Party. He told American leaders in both the government and the public that the Chinese Communist Party is the largest Communist group outside of the Soviet Union. China's current problems are even more serious than those of Greece and Eastern and Western European countries. If China becomes communist, then other East Asian countries, including Japan, cannot hope to avoid becoming vassal states of the Communist Party. Regarding the American view of the Chinese situation, Gu said that the American people are all friendly to China and are both concerned and sympathetic to China's prosperity. The various bills of the U.S. Congress and the aid to China plan passed this year are definite manifestations of this sympathy. However, the distance between China and the United States is vast, and the American people still lack an adequate understanding of the actual situation in China. The Ambassador said that in the past few years, the international propaganda promoted by the Chinese Communist Party in the United States has been the most active. The narrow views of those who promote Chinese communism are not only supported by countless American Communists and Communists from other countries, but also assisted by American leftists. They make one-sided reports or irresponsible criticisms of the political, economic, and military situation in China, and some American people are inadvertently affected by this malicious propaganda. Fortunately, most leaders of the American government and Congress understand the international nature of Communist Party activities and are also able to understand China's position, goals, and difficulties. Under their leadership, the broad masses of the American people are gradually understanding the major relationship between China's suppression of the Communist Party and world peace, and are further advocating assisting China in the arduous task of suppressing rebellion and building the country. Because of this American understanding, the aid to China plan was realized. Gu said that although the aid to China plan is very helpful to China, its amount cannot be compared with the aid to Europe plan and cannot meet China's needs. American friends who are concerned about China's problems also share this feeling, but believe that the passage of the aid to China plan by the United States, especially its military assistance, is sufficient to reflect the U.S. recognition of the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party. Gu emphasized that if China can fully utilize the current U.S. economic and military assistance, and especially implement reforms with a spirit of self-help, then the United States will surely continue to aid China. The Ambassador then hoped that all compatriots in the country would fully cooperate with the government to strengthen the suppression of rebellion, and said that without the elimination of the Communist threat, China will have no peaceful unification to speak of, nor can it achieve full freedom and complete independence.

### Ambassador to France Hosts Foreign Guests; Foreign Minister Wang Will Attend in Person

### A Message on the 37th National Day

The National Day of the Republic of China in its thirty-seventh year has arrived again in a season of clear skies, crisp air, gentle breezes, and bright sunshine. Recalling this day thirty-six years ago, a cannon blast from the engineering battalion within Wuchang City shook the 270-year-old unified empire of the Manchu Qing Dynasty. What followed was the successive response and declaration of independence by various provinces. In less than three months, the deeply rooted monarchical system was overthrown, transforming an ancient empire of four thousand years into a new nation for the Chinese people. In human history, this is truly a rare and momentous event. It goes without saying that the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation are filled with joy and enthusiasm as they celebrate this birthday of the new China. However, looking at the current environment, the Republic of China is amidst a myriad of calamities and difficulties. Our mood, even if we try to "force a smile," is almost impossible!

Our Republic of China, having experienced twenty-six years of life, has been in worry and disaster almost every day. We have encountered countless storms and turbulent waves, and now not only have the disasters not subsided, but they are becoming increasingly serious. We are truly letting down the martyrs, letting down our descendants, and even more so, letting down ourselves!

Looking at the overall world situation, the Republic of China has gone through two world wars in the past thirty-six years. Those around the age of forty clearly remember the events. During the First World War, although our country also stood on the side of the Allied Powers and participated in the war, we were not treated as a victorious nation. In particular, the occurrence of the "Shandong Problem" was truly a national humiliation for our Chinese nation. Later, although the Washington Conference achieved a reasonable solution, it made the enemy's ambitions to invade our country even more active. In less than ten years, the September 18th Incident broke out, eventually leading to a full-scale war between China and Japan. During the Second World War, thanks to the wise leadership and unwavering perseverance of our supreme leader, we finally achieved final victory. We not only abolished all unequal treaties, but also jumped to become one of the five great powers. The victory of the War of Resistance proved that our Chinese nation not only possesses the wisdom to harmonize with friendly nations abroad, but also possesses the potential to resist violence. From then on, China had the opportunity to transform from weakness to strength and to hold its head high with pride. Unexpectedly, what came with victory was the rebellion of the communist bandits, which made the country possess only the empty name of one of the five great powers, while its international status did not increase and even ran the risk of gradually declining. Time has slipped away, and three years have suddenly passed. The China after victory has not only not seen construction, but has instead been greatly damaged. The people are impoverished, and the finances are exhausted. It is unbearable to look back. Looking ahead at the international situation, the crisis of a third world war is imminent. If it unfortunately breaks out, the war will inevitably spread. How can such a weak and chaotic China cope with the future "atomic war" and "germ warfare"? Today, as we celebrate National Day, we really cannot help but cite this as a hidden worry for our country's current situation.

Looking at the evolution of the domestic situation, the Republic of China can be said to have been in chaos and turmoil at all times during these thirty-six years. Not long after its birth, it encountered the reaction of Hongxian's imperial system and Zhang Xun's restoration, but the reactionary forces ultimately could not defeat the giant wheel of the advance of the times. Attempts to restore the republic to an empire all failed. However, after twists and turns, it created a situation of autocratic rule and civil war by the Northern Warlords. They were selfish, self-interested, and short-sighted, knowing only themselves and not the country. Cao Kun's bribery to become president reached the pinnacle of darkness in our domestic politics. Therefore, the Kuomintang formed a revolutionary government and vowed to launch the Northern Expedition to overthrow the warlords who were dividing up the country and to unify the country. When the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it was full of vigor, and the whole country looked brand new. The people all looked forward to the realization of the Three Principles of the People. But unfortunately, internal troubles and external enemies arose one after another. The "January 28th" Songhu Incident, the "July 7th" Lugouqiao Incident, and the "August 13th" Songhu War followed one after another, eventually leading to an all-out war of resistance. In eight years, our Chinese nation experienced countless dangers and tasted countless hardships. The result of bleeding, sweating, and arduous resistance was nominally victory, but in reality, it was completely destroyed by the rebellion of the communist bandits. This group of bandits uses communism as a slogan, robbing property as an action, liquidation and struggle as an excuse, and violent dictatorship as a goal. Under the harassment of bandits, the people have already tasted the pain of burning, killing, looting, and robbery. Those outside the bandit areas also suffer from policy errors and shrinking production. Not only can Zhu live and work in peace, but also be threatened by hunger and death. Living in deep water and scorching fire is a true reflection of the lives of ordinary people today.

However, despite all the pain we have expressed above, swallowing our tears, we are still unwilling to become passive and stand idly by. We still have a strong belief in the bright future of the country. Although the Republic of China has been in trouble for thirty-six years, the difficulties and trials it has encountered have all been overcome by the great and unyielding spirit passed down by our national ancestors. As the saying goes, "adversity builds a nation." After being tempered by thousands of hammers and tongs, the Republic of China has long become an unconquerable nation. Although there are thorns and difficulties in front of us, we will never be afraid and will never retreat. We will still stand tall, stride forward. The Republic of China is over thirty years old, in the prime of its life, and will surely overcome any difficulties and create a brilliant future. Today is her thirty-seventh birthday. All the past is like yesterday's death, and all the future is like today's birth. Although the world situation is in deepening crisis, and the domestic situation is increasingly exposed, not only will it not make us frustrated and give up on ourselves, but it will only make us even more invigorated and make us work harder. We must be diligent and frugal, suppress rebellion and build the country, relieve the people from their suffering, and lay the foundation of the country on bedrock. Then we must grit our teeth and catch up head-on to cope with the future upheavals in the world. We believe that the Republic of China will be able to pass this serious test and find a way out of the crisis. But all of this responsibility lies on the shoulders of the national people who are celebrating National Day today!

The procuratorate suddenly received a letter yesterday from Mr. Zang Kaide, Third Secretary of the U.S. Embassy in China, inquiring whether Wang Qinglan is American or Chinese. The letter stated: "On September 24th, the Associated Press sent a telegram to the United States stating that Wang Qinglan, who shot and killed refugee students on Jiankang Road in the United States, has American nationality. However, Nanjing newspapers reported that Wang is from Shandong. In order to protect the interests of Americans in China, the Embassy is specifically inquiring whether Wang Qinglan is American or Chinese." According to the case file, Wang Qinglan only worked for the U.S. Fourteenth Air Force stationed in China and did not become an American citizen. He is a Chinese from Shandong.

### Jiangxi Province Selects Two Counties to Trial Implementation of Supporting Owner-Cultivators

To be Completed Within One Year Starting Next Month

[Our Correspondent in Nanchang, 9th] Liu Jida, Director of the Land Administration Bureau, talked about his return from a tour of the seventh district on the 9th: Jiangxi Province's land administration is almost completely stalled due to tight county-level staffing and the fact that many landlords use aliases to divide their households or evade reporting. This basic work of local governance is almost completely stalled. Now, the provincial government has decided to select Gan County and Yifeng to trial implement support for owner-cultivators. It is planned to collect 300,000 mu of land in Gan County and 200,000 mu in Yifeng to support 25,000 owner-cultivator households. This new policy will be implemented in phases. If the Executive Yuan can approve the funding and the period, it will begin next month and be completed within one year.

### Jiangxi Province Allocates Areas for Shanghai Refugees to Resettle

Awaiting Central Government Funding

[Our Correspondent in Nanchang, 9th] For Shanghai refugees to migrate to Jiangxi for cultivation, the local authorities have decided to allocate the Yushan-Shangrao area in the eastern section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. However, due to financial difficulties in the province, funds for the various reclamation expenses are awaiting allocation from the central government, but no instructions have yet been received from the central government. The Jiangxi Agricultural and Forestry Department's 29 agricultural farms own 100,000 mu of barren land, and only half of the land has been reclaimed. The department now plans to accommodate 3,500 refugees from Shanghai at each agricultural farm, but also feels that funding is insufficient.

### Commerce in Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Xinxiang Plunges into Extreme Chaos

[Our Correspondent in Xinxiang, 9th] Commerce in Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Xinxiang, three important economic towns, has now plunged into an extreme state of chaos. Many shops have closed due to the scarcity of goods, especially the lack of food and coal, which is a common phenomenon in the three towns. Due to the authorities' lack of effective control, coupled with the hoarding and manipulation by profiteers, almost everything needed by the people is obtained from the black market. Grain prices have even exceeded the limited price by a factor of one. The August 19th limited price is nothing more than a thing of the past. According to business people, the strict control of goods leaving Shanghai, Xuzhou, and other places has resulted in many goods ordered by merchants being detained and unable to be shipped, so the supply cannot meet the demand, which is also one of the reasons for the black market. The reporter now reports in good faith, and the government needs to pay attention and quickly make effective improvements.

### Xi'an Partially Restores Negotiated Pricing for Goods

After the expansion of the Hangzhou Economic Inspection Group, its focus will be on exposing large-scale hoarding. Citizens are encouraged to assist in catching the "big tigers." In addition to setting up inspection stations to prevent the outflow of materials, youth service stations and people's service stations are also being organized.

### Ningbo's Supply of Goods: Chiang Ching-kuo Gives Instructions
Collective Purchase and Distribution by the Chamber of Commerce

[Our Yin County Dispatch on the 9th] As this area falls under the supervision of the Shanghai District, Chiang Ching-kuo is very concerned about the supply of goods, factory raw materials, and transportation enterprises in this port. Yesterday, Principal Shi of Wu Ling School visited Zhou Dalei, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, on his way back to Feng Hua from Shanghai, conveying Chiang's instructions: (1) The supply of goods in Ningbo should be based on the Chamber of Commerce's statistics of monthly needs, with collective purchasing and distribution to various industries and markets. (2) The Xin Jiang Bridge is a vital transportation route in eastern Zhejiang, and it is hoped that local people will be motivated to raise funds quickly for its construction. After receiving the above instructions, Zhou convened representatives from various industries today to thoroughly discuss procurement methods. While acknowledging the necessity of building the Xin Jiang Bridge, the large amount of funding required necessitates further consultation with all parties to jointly plan its implementation.

[Our Nanchang Dispatch on the 9th] The "August 19th" economic defense line in Nanchang City has been breached by price surges and the black market. Price-controlled goods such as rice, oil, and cigarettes are available only to those with money, and the grain situation is even more serious. Many citizens are filling their stomachs with noodles or glutinous rice. The provincial government is now conducting armed anti-smuggling operations on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway South Station and Wenjiaba to prevent the export of grain. Yesterday and today, fifty large bags of rice being transported out of the area by soldiers were intercepted on the outskirts of the South Station.

### My Painting Exhibition Held in New York, Gu Weijun Writes a Special Preface to Introduce It

[New York Air Mail] The Chinese Modern Painting Exhibition opened on the 10th at the Du Cheng Museum in New York. Dr. Gu Weijun, our ambassador to the United States, wrote a special preface to introduce it, the original text of which is as follows: "Chinese art has always occupied a unique position in the world art scene. Through the efforts of scholars and artists over several centuries, it has created a special style containing spiritual and philosophical significance. Therefore, masterpieces of all ages have been treasured by people of all countries, and their contribution to cultural exchange between Chinese and foreign people is by no means insignificant.

However, the works of modern Chinese artists are less known in various countries, which actually affects the world's understanding of modern China. In recent decades, Chinese art has made considerable progress and can fully reflect the thoughts and lives of the Chinese people today, as well as the symphony produced by contact with Western culture.

I am very willing to introduce to the American people the modern Chinese painting exhibition being actively prepared by Professors Wang Yachen and Wang Shaoling. This painting exhibition is organized by the parties concerned in cooperation with Mr. Pu Ailun of the Metropolitan Museum, who himself has extensive and profound research on Chinese culture.

Professor Wang is a famous Chinese artist and educator, who has served as the president of Xinhua Normal School for many years and was recently sent to the United States by the Ministry of Education to study art education. Mr. Wang has studied Western painting in the United States for many years and was recently hired by the Central University as a Western painting teacher.

Entrusted by the China Cultural Relics Research Association and the International Cultural Cooperation Association, Wang and Wang brought more than 120 masterpieces by famous artists for exhibition. I firmly believe that Americans who appreciate Chinese art will want to be the first to see them.

This exhibition will first be held at the Metropolitan Museum, and then will be exhibited in several other cities, so that people in all parts of the United States can have the most opportunities to directly recognize these works. I firmly believe that the noble purpose and hard work of the two gentlemen will inspire people here to develop an interested appreciation for the best modern Chinese paintings."

### Truman Plans to Send Special Envoy to Moscow to Meet Stalin and Eliminate Crisis; Marshall Returns to the U.S. to Confer and Strongly Opposes; Neutral UN Representatives Mediate, But No Results Yet

[Reported by Our Publication] Washington, 9th (Broadcast from District): Marshall returned here this morning. President Truman had already waited at the airport and then went to the White House to hold an emergency meeting to decide whether to send a special envoy to Moscow to meet with Stalin to eliminate the differences between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, just like Hopkins' mission in 1945. It is reported that Marshall opposes this plan and advocates for its implementation to be delayed.

[Reported by Our Publication] Washington, 9th (Broadcast): Well-informed sources reported on the 9th that President Truman has appointed former Supreme Court Justice Vinson as a special envoy to Moscow to eliminate the crisis between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The White House and the State Department have not commented on this. Secretary of State Marshall is returning to the U.S. from Paris. It is feared that Marshall's hasty return was caused by Vinson's mission to the Soviet Union. It is claimed that Marshall believes this will hinder his mission at the UN and his personal negotiations with the Soviet Union regarding the Berlin and other issues. However, according to another report, Truman consulted Marshall on this matter, and after Marshall firmly opposed it, he dismissed the idea. Therefore, Marshall's return to the U.S. is purely for the purpose of reporting directly to Truman on the international situation. Another report states that the Vinson mission was initiated and carried out by the White House and was not agreed upon by the State Department. Marshall only learned about this in Paris. It is claimed that Marshall spoke to Truman by transatlantic telephone and strongly opposed it. He will insist on opposing it to the end upon his return to the U.S.

[Associated Press, Paris, 9th] It is rumored that Truman plans to send Under Secretary of State Vinson to the Soviet Union to meet with Stalin to discuss the Berlin crisis, but Marshall strongly opposes it. The British and French delegations here are greatly puzzled by this. UN personnel believe that the attitude of the U.S. delegation has been incomprehensible in recent days. "When they first came to Paris, they were aggressive and insisted that the Berlin issue be submitted to the Security Council instead of the General Assembly. However, in recent days, their attitude has been mysterious and they have refused to disclose their purpose."

[French News Agency, Paris, 9th] The representatives of six neutral countries—China, Argentina, Colombia, Belgium, and Canada—held a private consultation this morning, chaired by Argentine Foreign Minister Bramuglia, to mediate the Berlin issue. After a seventy-minute discussion, no concrete solution was reached, and it was decided to adjourn the meeting. No date has been set for the next meeting. According to diplomatic observers, the meeting broke up without results, probably because Vyshinsky was waiting for instructions from Moscow.

### Political Committee Discusses Disarmament Issue; Two Camps Engage in Verbal Sparring; Subcommittee Passes Atomic Control Plan

[Associated Press, Paris, 9th] The Western countries' atomic energy control plan was approved by a large majority in the UN subsidiary committee on the 9th, despite strong opposition from the Soviet Union.

[Associated Press, Paris, 9th] British representative Shawcross stated in the UN Political Committee on the 9th that the Soviet Union's current military strength is two and a half times that of before the war, and denounced the Soviet Union's disarmament proposal as "useless propaganda." Shawcross insisted that if the Soviet Union wants to reach an agreement on either disarmament or atomic control, it should be open and honest and put all its cards on the table. He also stated that unless an agreement on atomic control and measurement is reached first, there can be no agreement on the reduction of conventional armaments. Previously, Polish representative Mochnevsky launched an attack, claiming that the world's fear of war was caused by the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. He supported the proposal to reduce the military strength of the five powers by one-third within one year. Belarusian representative Kiselev repeated his old tune, accusing American personnel of planning to wage war against the Soviet Union and condemning the Western European alliance as "full of aggression."

[Our Publication] Paris, 9th (Broadcast): It is expected that the U.S. will follow Britain in rejecting the Soviet Union's proposal to reduce the military strength of the five powers by one-third within one year. The U.S. will accuse the Soviet proposal of being insincere and merely a "propaganda tactic."

### Berlin City Elections to Be Held on December 5th
May Cause Serious Political Consequences

[French News Agency, Berlin, 8th] The Berlin City Council met in the British zone tonight and decided to hold Berlin city elections on December 5th.

[French News Agency, Berlin, 8th] Observers here believe that the Berlin City Council's unanimous passage of the resolution to hold elections on December 5th in the absence of Communist Party members may cause serious political consequences. A British military government spokesman said that although the Allied authorities in the Western zone had recently approved the election procedures proposed by the City Council, the approval was not an order or a suggestion. The Soviet authorities have not yet clearly stated their position on this. A previous Soviet communique stated that this was "untrue and provocative," and the Soviet authorities would try to prevent the election. Another foreign observer said, "I hope that we will not risk a third world war in order to have Professor Luther serve as mayor of Berlin."

### Churchill Loudly Calls for No More Appeasement of the Soviet Union; Fully Supports Government's Policy on Berlin

[Associated Press, Ulsterton, 9th] British wartime Prime Minister Churchill said to the Conservative Party conference, "It seems that we are relentlessly moving toward the Third World War. Communist Soviet Union has fully armed, and its military strength in Europe has already exceeded the total of the Western countries." Churchill then sadly declared, "I do not want to speak empty words, but to tell you that there is still hope for reconciliation with the Soviet Union." After severely condemning "the increasingly blatant aggression and the utter betrayal of trust and justice by the Soviet government," Churchill said that he has always been confused as to why the British and American people, who have had so much experience in the past, still cannot promptly realize the danger of the Soviet Union's challenge to their lives and freedom from the East. Churchill said, "The fourteen people in the Kremlin (referring to the Soviet Politburo) arbitrarily and totalitarianly rule 300 million people, and the extent of their authority is unprecedented since Ivan the Great. They now dominate half of Europe in a communist way." Churchill said that the Berlin situation "could lead to a global war at any time." If he were in office, he would retaliate against the Soviet Union's import of war materials as a bargaining chip. He said, "The government's policy is to disregard all consequences and not retreat a single step in Berlin. We give it our full support."

[Our Newspaper] Chiang Ching-kuo paid two successive visits to the President yesterday morning, vigorously arguing that price controls must be maintained; otherwise, the economic management work in Shanghai would inevitably be rendered futile. When Wu Kuo-chen and Wu Kai-hsien called on the President yesterday morning, they gave a detailed report on the city's control and regulation situation. Director Wu also emphasized that price controls should be coordinated with production and should not be divorced from each other; otherwise, price controls would fail. Without production, there would be no goods or prices, creating a problem of availability rather than price. After listening to the opinions separately, the President gave strict instructions on the spot. In addition, Commander Xuan also paid a visit to the President in the morning, reporting on the security situation in Shanghai.

From 3:00 PM, the President summoned Yu Hung-chun and Yu Shu-ping. The President was very concerned about the financial and price situation in Shanghai, especially the rampant speculation.

### Shanghai Flour Mills' Raw Material Inventory Dwindling Daily, Requesting the Central Government to Adjust Wheat Price Controls

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] According to the Grain News Agency, Shanghai flour mills are experiencing a daily decrease in raw material inventory. Furthermore, due to the price control of 10.30 yuan, while wheat transported from Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places to Shanghai costs 11 yuan, the source has almost disappeared. Even if purchased, adulteration reaches more than 10%, greatly affecting the product. As a result, the output of various manufacturers has decreased by an average of one-half compared to the time of the August 19th price control. The Ministry of Food originally planned to purchase 1.4 million bags of flour from Shanghai factories each month, but it has had to significantly reduce this amount. Of the 700,000 bags planned for the first half of October, only 400,000 bags are guaranteed. Manufacturers have truthfully reported the impending crisis to the Ministry of Food, requesting negotiations with relevant parties to adjust the price control of wheat in Shanghai, referencing market prices in Suzhou and Wuxi, to maintain the current production situation. The Ministry of Food attaches great importance to this matter and is currently discussing a proper solution with all parties. According to the Economic Management Committee, Shanghai flour mills' request to adjust price controls has been telegraphed to the supervisor of the Shanghai region for review and handling, and a reply has been requested directly from the Ministry of Food.

### A Large-Scale Health Exhibition Will Be Held Today at Aurora University, with an Electric Lung Disease Model that Is Most Thought-Provoking

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Health Bureau, in view of the excessively high morbidity and mortality rates of Shanghai citizens, and in order to make the general public aware of the importance of hygiene and medicine in a popular way, has specially organized a large-scale health exhibition, which will be open to the public free of charge at the auditorium of Aurora University starting from Double Ten Festival. This kind of exhibition is still a pioneering event in the city after the victory. The preparatory work is jointly undertaken by the Bureaus of Education, Public Utilities, and Public Works, as well as more than ten organizations including Tongji, Aurora, St. John's, Tongde, Shanghai, and Southeast Medical Colleges, Shanghai Dental College, Pasteur Institute, Anti-Tuberculosis Association, and the United States Information Service. The exhibits include fifteen groups such as decomposition and anatomy, physiology, pathology, bacteria, parasites, infectious disease management, nursing, maternal and child health, school hygiene, and factory hygiene. The order of display is: the first part explains the structure of the human body, the second part explains the sources of disease, and the third part explains how to improve health. Each exhibition room has eye-catching slogans and statistical charts attached to the walls. Among them, the lung disease exhibition room is equipped with a thunderous model, with a sickbed on the left and a coffin on the right. The explanation in the middle states that only 3.1 million people died in the war of resistance against Japan in the past eight years, but as many as 10.8 million people died of lung disease. On average, 3 million out of every 100,000 people die of lung disease each year. In terms of wealth loss, if each lung disease patient spends one gold yuan per day, society must spend 5 billion gold yuan each year in addition to not being able to increase production. This model is novel and most thought-provoking.

### Daily Necessities Difficult to Purchase as Required, The General Labor Union Registers and Asks the Authorities to Implement Rationing

Since the government promulgated the Emergency Financial and Economic Measures on August 19 this year, issued gold yuan, and implemented currency reform, national prices have been limited to the August 19 prices, and the index-based salary calculation method has been abolished, so workers' wages have also been frozen. The gold yuan conversion standard is calculated based on the cost of living index announced on August 15. The Municipal General Labor Union believes that the index is based on the average prices from August 1 to August 13, which is far from the price limits on August 19, and some workers have not yet been able to convert into gold yuan according to the index, so it is believed that the losses suffered by workers are quite large. In particular, in recent days, it has been difficult for workers to purchase daily necessities at the limited prices, so the union has repeatedly reported the hardships of workers to the government authorities and requested appropriate adjustments, but due to the current economic management situation, the request has not been approved, so the lives of general workers have been greatly threatened. After the union submitted it to the 53rd council meeting for discussion, it was decided to register all union members and their families in the city, so as to request the government to implement rationing at limited prices to maintain the inadequacy of life. After careful consideration by the responsible persons of the union, the resolution was notified to all industry unions in the city yesterday to comply with and organize an investigation committee.

### A Soldier Who Was Dismissed Had Evil Intentions and Abused the Daughter of the Uniform Shop Owner, Forcing Her to Leave Her Family and Sending Her to the District Attorney's Office for Questioning

[Our Newspaper] Dai Hongxin, owner of the Dai Hongji uniform shop at No. 757, Jiujiang Road, has a daughter named Bingxia, who is twenty-one years old and beautiful. Dai loves her like a pearl. Zhou Keding, 25, a former soldier of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police stationed in the 3rd Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters, was dismissed due to misconduct. He came to the shop to have a uniform made and gradually became intimate with the daughter. Zhou, with evil intentions, was determined to force himself on Bingxia, and Hongxin asked about his military status. In early December of last year, Dai returned to his hometown with his family, leaving his daughter in charge of the store. Zhou learned of this situation and sneaked into the daughter's room one night and forced himself on her. The daughter was unable to resist and was abused. At about 11:00 PM on the 7th of this month, Zhou came to the store again and insisted on inviting the daughter out to talk. The daughter refused, and Zhou became angry and wrote a threatening letter, ordering Dai to hand it over to his daughter. The next morning, the daughter received a call from Zhou, asking her to meet at the Nanguo Restaurant, otherwise he would deal with her severely. The daughter was in a dilemma and finally went to the meeting. She then went to Zhou's residence at No. 27, Guizhou Road, and Zhou took out a sharp blade, forcing the daughter to leave her family and marry him. The daughter pretended to go home, and Zhou followed her to the store. When he saw the daughter's father, he slapped him twice and threatened him. Someone called the police, who arrived and took Zhou to the bureau for interrogation and confirmed the facts. Zhou was accused of obstructing family and transferred to the District Attorney's Office for investigation.

### Liu Yuqing Defends Against Bank Law Violation Charges with Four Points

[Report from our newspaper] Liu Yuqing, a businessman newly arrived in Shanghai from Peiping and Tianjin, residing at Cishu Mansion, was previously accused of using the Tianjin Yixing Factory Office as a cover to continuously engage in private banking operations since May of this year. After police investigation, codebooks and telegrams were seized on the spot, and it was determined that the amount of funds transferred from Tianjin reached a substantial sum of 6,000 Gold Yuan. The case was transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation and closure, and Liu was prosecuted for violating banking laws. The District Court held a hearing yesterday afternoon, where Liu, accompanied by his lawyer, presented four points in his defense: (1) The 6,000 Gold Yuan remittance was borrowed from the Dalu Bank of Tai City for the purpose of purchasing cotton yarn in Shanghai, as evidenced by the loan agreement from Dalu Bank; it was not a foreign exchange speculation. (2) The seized drafts of letters concerned the severe economic controls in Shanghai after "August 19th" [referring to the currency reform of August 19, 1948], and contained nothing else. (3) The secret code was used by the former residents of the office, Xinyi and Fuqian, for foreign exchange speculation, and the defendant himself did not understand it. (4) The destroyed documents were mere notes and not important documents. After the defense, the court briefly questioned the points provided and scheduled the verdict for the afternoon of the sixteenth.

### Yang Anren et al.'s Request for Retrial Rejected Again by the District Court

[Report from our newspaper] The Jinchao case, which has attracted nationwide attention, was previously heard by Judge Wang Jiazhuo of the District Court. Yang Anren was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, and Mo Sheng was sentenced to four years of imprisonment. The defendants applied for a retrial, but the High Court determined that the original judgment was appropriate in both the application of the law and the sentencing, and approved the original judgment, transferring them to the Shanghai Prison. Subsequently, Yang and others, citing new evidence, applied for a retrial, which was repeatedly rejected by the District Court in accordance with the law. Recently, the High Court, based on an appeal, remanded the case for a new ruling. For the sake of prudence, the District Court telegraphed the Supreme Court to transfer the case to the Capital District Court or another court for handling. The Supreme Court reviewed the case file and determined that the case did not need to be transferred, replying that it could still be handled impartially by the Shanghai District Court. Having learned this, the District Court believed that Yang and others' application for a retrial was still without legal basis and rejected it in a ruling yesterday. The ruling was immediately served to all parties involved.

It was determined that the white newsprint was purchased and stored by Wang Meifang, manager of the Hongfengxin Paper Shop on Chongqing Road in Shanghai, in 1943 and has been stored for five years.

### Promoting Production of State-Owned Enterprises: Issuance of Corporate Bonds to be Approved; Pilot Program to Begin with Factories and Mines Affiliated with the Resources Commission

[Report from our newspaper] According to authoritative sources in the financial community, in order to facilitate state-owned enterprises in obtaining working capital needed for production without increasing currency issuance, the government will allow the issuance of corporate bonds to guide social idle funds through banking organizations for use in production. The plan is to start with a pilot program involving factories and mines affiliated with the Resources Commission, with national banks and bureaus underwriting the bonds and then reselling them to the public. Detailed measures are being discussed and drafted by the Central Bank and various national banks and bureaus. According to relevant sources, the issuance of corporate bonds is not only easier to raise funds, but also simpler in terms of repayment procedures. The public can purchase these bonds, which are stable and reliable with regular repayment and a certain amount of interest. In recent years, the issuance of corporate bonds has been highly developed in Europe and the United States and is an effective way to use private funds. Once the pilot program for state-owned enterprises proves successful, private enterprises may also follow suit.

(1) After 紡建 is reorganized into a joint-stock company, all personnel, administrative, and business management methods will be handled in accordance with general company practices, and past systems will be adjusted accordingly.

(2) 紡建's current yarn inventory is only sufficient to repay the 行總 (Executive Yuan War Relief Supplies Bureau), the Textile Export Association, and US Aid cotton yarn, with no remaining amount available for the market. Future market supply issues will be managed by the Central Bank through yarn allocation.

(3) The current General Manager Shu Yunzhang is firm in his intention to resign. However, he will remain in his position in the short term until the board of directors can find a suitable replacement.

(4) Li Bingyu was appointed to represent 紡建 at the World Textile Industry Conference to be held in Geneva.

### Cotton Yarn and Cloth Production Declines Daily

The problem of raw materials has not been resolved, and as a result of panic buying, cotton yarn and cloth production has declined, and factories are reducing production. Pan Shihao, chairman of the 复织 Association (Re-weaving Association), suggested that a portion of the 60,000 bales of 行總 (Executive Yuan War Relief Supplies Bureau) cotton yarn stored in the Central Bank be allocated to the market to meet the urgent needs. However, due to the inability to resolve foreign exchange issues, the dyestuffs required by the re-weaving industry have become limited in stock recently and difficult to replenish. Although they can be purchased on the black market, the prices are twice as high as the controlled prices, which will increase costs. Purchasing from the black market would violate the law. Therefore, the industry hopes that the authorities will quickly resolve the raw material problem. Furthermore, the factories of the Qingdao China Textile Branch Company have recently felt a severe shortage of raw materials and are requesting the headquarters to quickly find a way to allocate a large amount of cotton to meet their urgent needs. The company is currently writing to the Cotton Group to quickly allocate the second batch of aid cotton.

Furthermore, according to reports, the yarn market continues to be closed. Small-scale handicrafts manufacturers in the city, for whom cotton yarn is the main raw material, and wholesalers from Suzhou and Hangzhou, have come to Shanghai to compete for purchases from yarn shops, causing Jinling Road yarn wholesale shops to be very crowded. Buyers are mainly interested in the four types of yarn with counts of 16, 20, 32, and 40.

### Dull Silk Market

The rayon market remains sluggish. The allocation by the association did not reach its quota yesterday. Japanese goods are no longer available in the market. The raw materials of the Italian goods miscellaneous silk fabrics are considered too substandard, and applications for allocation have decreased. Raw silk transactions are quiet. Sellers are unwilling to sell, and buyers are not interested due to the lack of foreign transportation. The silk weaving industry on this street is mostly applying to the 輸管會 (Export Control Board) for allocation, and only sporadic transactions are taking place in the market.

Retail sales of silk fabrics have begun to slacken. Sichuan silk is becoming scarce due to restrictions on out-of-province sales. Silk factories are about to begin allocating goods, which has somewhat stabilized people's minds.

Furthermore, according to reports, the Central Trust Bureau, acting as an agent for the Government Property Disposal Committee, distributed over 400 boxes of rayon this week and sold woolens, sundries, etc. at auction, obtaining a total of 1.4 million Gold Yuan. It is scheduled to auction off sundries and other goods next Friday.

### China Textile Corporation Sells Cloth

Since the cotton cloth market has been suspended, the business of wholesale firms has suddenly declined due to transportation restrictions. Retail cloth shops, stimulated by the panic buying, have sold out their inventories, and their replenishment relies on the supply of cloth from the building weaving industry and the China Textile Construction Corporation. The supply source is still considered sufficient. It is reported that the染织业 (dyeing and weaving industry) has entrusted the Cotton Cloth Association to distribute the first batch of 35,000 pieces, of which a total of 12,000 pieces have been distributed.

The second batch of 64,000 pieces, due to the wide variety of patterns, coincided with the surge in panic buying, and cloth shops were eager to replenish their inventories, so the allocation quota is almost exhausted, with only a few hundred pieces remaining. It is reported that a third batch of 60,000 pieces will be allocated next Monday, with the association preparing to distribute 20,000 pieces first. The China Textile Corporation continues to distribute cloth every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday as usual, but due to the surge in demand, the number of customers allocated has been slightly limited. Yesterday, 9-pound 3B Longtou fine cloth was distributed at a price of 18.6 yuan. This fine cloth was originally manufactured for export, with a width of 36 inches and a length of only 30 yards.

### Central Bank Changes Regulations on Security Deposits for Silver and Money Industries

According to a spokesperson for the Central Bank, President Yu has revised the regulations regarding the request from the money industry to be exempt from paying security deposits for clearing: (1) Pay half of the prescribed amounts of 10,000, 5,000, and 3,000. (2) Half of the reduced security deposit must be paid before the 10th of this month, and the remaining half must be paid after the completion of the capital increase. Banks must pay the security deposit as prescribed. Half must be paid before October 10th, and the other half must be paid after the capital increase is completed. The Central Bank has notified the banking and money industries in various regions to comply with the above measures.

Furthermore, it has been learned that the request from the banking and money industries to reduce the amount of capital increase is impossible.

### Ministry of Finance Reinterprets Bank Loan-to-Deposit Ratio

[Report from our newspaper] Regarding how to calculate the percentage of credit loans, real estate mortgage loans, or investments to the total amount of deposits as stipulated in the Banking Law, the Ministry of Finance previously stipulated that the total amount of deposits should be calculated on a consolidated basis for the entire bank. It is now learned that, for the sake of calculation convenience, the Ministry of Finance has further clarified in detail as follows: The percentage of such loans and investments to the total amount of deposits "can be calculated by adding and subtracting interbank transactions (adding credit balance and subtracting debit balance) to the deposits of each head office and branch office, resulting in the individual deposits of each head office and branch office, and then calculating the percentage with its individual credit loans, real estate mortgage loans, or investments, in order to simplify the process. If funds other than deposits are used for various loans or investments, they should be included in the calculation of deposits."

### Export Control Board Announces Export Prices for Export Goods

### Passenger Bringing Cash to Guangdong Temporarily Limited to 1,000 Yuan per Person

Diao Minren, representative of the Guangzhou District Economic Supervisory Office, announced on the 8th that the office has received three regulations from the Executive Yuan's Shangyang Electromechanical Office regarding restrictions on the transport of cash to Guangdong:

(1) The amount of cash that passengers can bring to Guangdong is temporarily limited to 1,000 Gold Yuan per person.

[Report from our newspaper] The National Bank Business Bureau recently sent Circular No. 158 to various designated banks, stating: "Regarding the measures for overdue exchange settlement of export consignment goods, as stipulated in this bank's Circular Nos. 134 and 154, we hereby amend that, from today onwards, all overdue exchange settlement of export consignment goods shall be calculated at 70% of the current exchange rate. The provisions of Section 5 of this bank's former Circular No. 134 and Circular No. 154 shall be immediately repealed."

### Sluggish Rice Market; Grain Transactions Enter a State of Stagnation

Rice continues to arrive, but there are very few transactions in the market. The North Market has 502 shi of Bai Geng and Yang Xian rice, and the South Market has 313 shi, for a total of 815 shi. There are also rice shops selling 110 shi of rice on their own. Although the above rice is sold at controlled prices, it can only be purchased by those who are close to the owners, so transactions have not yet returned to normal.

Grain transactions have almost entered a state of stagnation. Only dozens of bags of raw peanuts were officially offered in the city. Soybeans are difficult to buy, and there are no transactions for corn, red beans, or broad beans. No one is selling high-quality sesame seeds, and no one is buying low-quality sesame seeds, so no transactions have taken place. Kaifeng raw peanuts are 32.7 yuan, and new 生　 are 35.7 yuan.

### Active Tea Market

Yesterday, the foreign firm tea market was relatively active. Because exporters feel that the demand for tea in Europe and Africa is strong, buying interest remains high. However, holders of goods feel that the production season has passed and the market inventory is very scarce, so they remain hesitant, resulting in few attractive transactions. The potential profit is unparalleled.

It is reported that a certain company in the city has received a telegram from Morocco requesting an immediate shipment of 50 tons of 屯 Green tea to meet urgent needs. However, under the above circumstances, the person in charge of the company is currently unable to respond. As for domestic sales tea, there is also a shortage of supply and an excess of demand, and the market atmosphere is firm in the quiet.

### Sugar Still Popular

The sugar market was popular again yesterday. The prices of various grades are close to the limit. Because the sugar industry will implement an allocation system and stop market transactions, it is generally expected that the supply will be limited, so those in need are taking the opportunity to buy in advance. The amount of goods in the market suddenly decreased, and people's minds became firmer, with most holders watching the situation. No. 22 sand white, No. 45 car white精 sugar are not available in the market, and no prices have been quoted. Medium sand, Xinghua white, Gao Ben factory cotton white are mostly in demand, while the rest are consistent.

### High Prices for Bricks, Ashes, and Other Goods

The shortage of bricks and ashes is becoming more serious, and builders, unable to stop construction on half-completed houses, are collecting them regardless of the high prices, making the atmosphere of overpricing even more intense. Since the factory stopped supplying cement, retailers have been unable to supply large quantities, and it is difficult to purchase even ten or twenty bags. It is temporarily limited to one or two bags. It is rumored that the price of lime has exceeded the limit by 100%. Someone is calling to buy it. Small and large brick sizes are available for retail, but they are also about to be sold out.

### Spicing Up the National Day Holiday: Fuxing Cup Final Today, China National Aviation Corporation vs. Samsung at 3:00 PM

### Power and Majesty

— Jingwen

Reading the news from the Paris Conference these past few days in the newspaper is truly interesting. Many people are worried that a third world war may break out as a result, but I, like the slippery view of people like Tingli Ross, believe that although war is very "possible," it is also "not necessarily" so. Seeing British Foreign Secretary Bevin's sharp speech and Vyshinsky's retort certainly makes one sweat for the matter of war; however, seeing the photograph of American representative Austin and Vyshinsky laughing shoulder-to-shoulder, you almost suspect that they are at a cocktail party in the Palais de Chaillot.

International diplomacy is, of course, sacred and extraordinary. A single misstep can often lead to unexpectedly serious consequences, especially in the case of this United Nations General Assembly. The attending representatives are mostly heads of state from various countries, and their sighs and laughs become major headlines in the world's telecommunications. The situation of war and peace may be determined by a raise of their hands or a slam of their tables. It is not only sacred, but also extraordinarily important.

However, although the identity of international conference representatives is very important, they are still human beings of flesh and blood. They have emotions, common sense, and even humor. This column has previously published special features on the representatives of various countries at the conference, such as representatives who like to sketch portraits at the conference, representatives who love to write poetry, and representatives who are good at drawing curves. If you look past their representative identities, they are no different from a group of elementary school students in a classroom.

If we were to say that the fate of our world is decided by this group of people, it seems too incredible. Yet the fact cannot deny this point. Writing this, I can't help but think of Napoleon, as described by Tolstoy in his book "War and Peace." Napoleon's private life was very romantic. He even had to spray perfume before going into battle. That such a figure could lead an army, conquer Germany, Austria, England, and Russia, and become emperor is also a historical miracle. However, after the Battle of Waterloo, where was the hero of a generation? Napoleon was nothing more than an ordinary prisoner of war.

Whether a person is important or not has nothing to do with the person themselves, especially for politicians. The reason why politicians appear important is simply the power granted to them by their position. Once a person has a position and power, even if they still want to try to maintain their original human face, it is often impossible. Friends often say when they meet that so-and-so is now in power. The close relationship of munching spiced beans and peanuts together in the past can no longer be restored. Now, not only must one submit a name card before seeing them, but one can only nod and agree when meeting. So everyone says that so-and-so has become "snobbish" after gaining power. However, I can understand this kind of person very well. The person is still so-and-so at heart, but their position and power have to create a barrier between you, me, and them. Without sufficient courage, this barrier is not easily broken. Once they lose their position and power, they will still be able to return to the comradeship of spiced beans and peanuts.

What makes power and position a burden that individuals cannot get rid of is what is called majesty. The origin of majesty actually arises from people's illusions about the external appearances of things. For example, a dance hall will never give rise to a sense of majesty, but if it is changed into a solemn meeting hall, people who are in it cannot help but feel a sense of gravity, and a sense of majesty will also arise spontaneously. The Palais de Chaillot, where the Paris Conference is now located, was originally a museum. It has solemnity, but perhaps not true majesty. However, once it is converted into an international conference hall, and with all the people coming in and out being people with the highest power and status in the contemporary world, how can it not appear majestic?

Since majesty easily creates a heavy mood, and with everyone involved having their own power and status background, it is truly difficult to seek lighthearted peace negotiations in such an environment. The psychological reserve has long become an obstacle to harmony and cooperation. If verbal conflicts are encountered occasionally, it is rare for them not to become stalemates. We Chinese have always paid attention to the diplomacy of negotiating between cups of wine. The Western cocktail party is similar to this. If major international conferences in the future can be carried out in the sounds of "cheers, cheers," and if power, status, and the majesty that comes with them are seen as less important, then world peace may be hopeful.

Diluting the concept of power, status, and majesty is difficult for those involved, but easy for onlookers, because those involved are on the stage. The concept of "maintaining one's stage presence" is extremely difficult to break. Conversely, if the audience offstage can view the "plot" more plainly, without having to clap and cheer or boo, then the people onstage can easily come down, and they will not have to pretend and do a real show, or use real knives and guns. Our world now seems like a dance hall. The play is being acted, but it is still a fake play. We only ask that all parties in the audience can relax a step, and then the situation of real knives and guns can be avoided.

### Ascending the Literary Selections Tower

— Shi Shufan

Who is warming the old dream of Liang?
The autumn willows of the Taicheng are no more,
I only pity the imperial son's flowing literary talent,
Coming to the monk's tower to find traces.
Today, words and poems can no longer be mended,
Different dynasties have different views on the landscape.
The chickens turn ten thousand bamboos into divine arrows,
The setting sun silently sends the temple gate.

### Harmonizing Verse

— Zhang Shang'an

The mountain's intention of forming a camp still remains,
How many people are warming the old dream of Nanlei?
I playfully pity the shadow of the slanting platform in the stars and frost,
Unable to distinguish the wine and tears on the soldier's clothes.
In the past, there were promises about life and death,
Now, no one discusses success or failure.
I ascended to a height, feeling a sense of vastness,
And even wrote a poem at the temple gate.

### Hearing the Sound of Fried Chestnuts on the Market

— Yu Qingxuan

An old journey from fifteen years ago,
Light frost on the reeds in Xixi Stream,
How can I know where autumn is old in Jiangcheng?
The first sound of frying incense.

### Searching for Du Fu's Tomb in Yueyang

— Wu Shoupeng

The affection of the Xiang River is what I think of most,
The old gardens of Qin and Shu have long been desolate,
Floating souls and sinking spirits are all suffering,
Still returning south to Jiuyi.

### Patience, Resistance, Agility

— Yi Jun

My residence is in Zhabei, but my workplace is in Nanshi. Every morning I take the No. 2B public bus from Zhabei to Nanshi, and every afternoon I return from Nanshi to Zhabei. Speaking of taking the public bus, one needs several great skills, namely: patience, resistance, and agility.

As the name suggests, a public bus is not a private car for one person, so it cannot be available at any time. You must wait at the stop. While waiting, you must have patience. It is fortunate if the bus arrives in one or two minutes, and it is not bad luck if it arrives in five minutes or a quarter of an hour. But it is unlucky when you have to wait for half an hour, forty or fifty minutes. But you have to be patient - yelling, jumping, getting anxious, and cursing are useless.

You are not the only one waiting for the bus, and the more people wait, the more crowded it gets. So the arrival of the bus is a great joy, but getting on the bus is a major emergency. Before the bus stops, people have already surrounded the door in a circle. The people on the bus have not yet gotten off, but the people waiting to get on have already drawn their swords and are ready to charge into battle. Whoever is agile will get on first. At the same time, you have to have resistance. You have to be as stable as Mount Tai and as solid as a rock so that you are not pushed away by others. Your back and waist must be able to resist the pressure of other people's fists, arms, and kneecaps. Your feet must be prepared to be trampled on by others. You must seize any opportunity and enter any opening. See if you are that agile.

Is it all right once you get on the bus? No, you still have to be patient. If there is no seat, you have to stand. If people are pressing on you, hands are covering your head, or your head and neck are encircled, you can only be patient and only resist. Everyone is squeezed into a group, crushed into a pile. The pushing, bumping, and falling when the bus starts are needless to say. Sometimes, when the express bus stops suddenly, the whole bus of people falls sharply in the same direction. This "disaster" is unbearable. The production of carbon dioxide inside the bus is abundant, and the people who are coughing are not to be outdone, putting on a wonderful performance. There are also those who spit, showing great skill. With an open mouth, there is a whoosh, a mouthful of phlegm, like a meteor, like a missile, or like the white light of a swordsman, already crossing over your head and going outside the window. But when the phlegm passes over your head, there must be some scattered saliva, big beads and small beads falling on your head or sticking to your collar. You also have to be patient with this. Because there are many people of this kind, and if you interfere with them, they will not be honest, and will "retaliate with an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth." Since those who cough cough, and those who spit spit, naturally bacteria fly around, each seeking a host. Therefore, your body must have resistance, and then you can avoid contracting diseases.

The person sitting in front of you will not get off the bus, so there is no empty seat. You have to be patient. When there is an empty seat, you have to be agile so that you can grab the seat. If you fail to grab the seat, you still have to be patient.

This situation is not an exaggeration at all. I know that the trolleybus is better because it has a larger capacity. I take the public bus, the No. 2 public bus, and the No. 2 public bus with a "B" on it. There are surprisingly few buses, so this situation is never an exception. There is really never an exception. The situation is better with the No. 2 public bus without the "B", because there are more buses. The most commendable thing is the orderly queuing at the Qiujiang Road station, showing a clear order.

Because I take the No. 2B public bus every day, I have learned three major skills: patience, resistance, and agility.

### Wang Huaizu's Hand-Annotated Yilin

— Qian Dacheng

Mr. Wang Huaizu (Niansun) of Gaoyou was a master of practical learning during the Qing dynasty. His book "Reading Miscellany" is already immortal. However, his hand-annotated classical books are rarely seen. In July of the thirty-fourth year of the Republic of China, I unexpectedly obtained his hand-annotated "Jiao Shi Yi Lin" at Songshi Studio in Suzhou. The original book was the "Jin Dai Mi Shu" edition from Jiguge. Initially, the bookseller did not mention whose annotations they were. I carefully examined it and found two large square seals, "Wang Family Collection of Gaoyou" and "Distinguished Family of Huaihai," confirming that it was once owned by Mr. Huaizu. The book is annotated in both red and black ink, meticulously referencing the Tang and Song dynasty encyclopedias "Youyang Zazu" and Mr. Lu Yidian of my county's Yilin school's collation of Song dynasty texts. The annotations are extensive, profound, and refined, unlike what one would expect from someone merely known as a book collector. The handwriting is extremely similar to that of Mr. Huaizu's annotated "Song Bao's Explanations of Characters, Supplemented with Lost Sections" in the Nanjing Longpanli National Academy of Learning Library. Comparing it with Wang's ink calligraphy in the "Chart of the Shuowen System," the resemblance is striking. Therefore, I know that it is Wang's hand-annotated edition without a doubt. I obtained it at a low price. Shouldn't I consider myself extremely fortunate? Throughout my life, I have been fortunate to see many old books, but due to my family's poverty, I could not keep them for myself, like clouds passing before my eyes. Only in the past did I obtain a fragment of Lu Baoyun's hand-annotated "Chuo Geng Lu" at a small price, which can be compared to this. I intend to transcribe some of his annotations to show them to those studying practical learning. The owner of Songshi Studio, Elder Zhang, passed away this spring. Recalling the joy of sitting and discussing art with him in the past is like another lifetime. I have also left Wumen (Suzhou) and returned to my hometown, and my interest in seeking books has greatly diminished. Fine books are also not often seen. I write this to record the shadows of past dreams.

### Old News from the Double Tenth Festival, Newly Copied

— Song Xian

In the first year of the Republic of China, on the Double Tenth Festival, this newspaper's "Free Talk" section had a commemorative article that said: "What day is today? It is the first National Day of the Republic of China. Colorful flags are flying high, and the whole country is ecstatic. However, upon careful examination of national affairs, there are feelings in our hearts. Regarding domestic affairs, opinions are divided, and there is internal strife; regarding foreign affairs, the powers are watching like tigers, and recognition is uncertain; regarding finances, the Minister of Agriculture looks up at the roof, and resources are exhausted to meet needs; regarding military affairs, disbandment is not organized, and frequent alarms occur; the common people lack patriotism, and there are many rebellious elements in the border regions. The land is scarred, and it is unbearable to look back; the future is thorny, and how can we not be saddened! On this commemorative occasion, there are endless sighs, how can we force ourselves to follow the vulgar and engage in joyful celebrations?" Although times have changed, except for the "recognition" mentioned, it still seems to be applicable as a reflection on this year's Double Tenth Festival.

Also, in the first year of the Republic of China, on the Double Tenth Festival, the Founding Father attended the National Day celebration held by the Chinese Students' Association of the World in Shanghai. During his speech, he said: "...Although the Republic of China has been established, it is still in a dangerous era. Internal unrest has not been quelled, and foreign troubles are frequent. It is like building a tall building, the foundation has been laid, but it still needs to be constructed. I hope that my compatriots will have an adventurous spirit, a persevering spirit, and cooperate to support the government from now on to create a first-class power on earth. This is what I deeply hope for from you all..."

After copying the newspaper, I cannot help but sigh. I only hope that "future generations will view us as we view the past!"

### 

Confucius said, "For three months, he did not know the taste of meat." If he were to patrol the streets and alleys of Beijing, especially during the autumn and winter months, he would smell the aroma of meat everywhere. The soil here is thick and lacks water, so the taste of fish and shrimp is far less fresh and delicious than in the south. However, the fatty and tender meat, especially mutton, and the cooking methods researched over hundreds of years are unparalleled in the country. The "Xikou mutton" from outside the Great Wall is considered the best. The three best ways to cook it are "stewing," "hot pot," and "roasting." "Stewing" refers to mutton of the highest quality, adding fragrant family secrets passed down for generations, hence the price is particularly high and business is flourishing. "Roasting" involves placing a large iron grate over a stove fire, cutting the meat into thin slices, mixing it with spices, sauce, and oil, allowing diners to use iron forks to skewer and roast the meat themselves, eating it as soon as it's cooked. It's exceptionally fresh and savory. A certain Wan family in the western part of the city is the most famous, but there is also one in the northern part of the city, and people flock to it in droves, having to queue for a spot as if at a bank run. And when eating, they spread their legs, extend their arms, and adopt postures like martial arts performers, opening their mouths like hungry tigers devouring food. It's both amusing and impressive. Even fashionable men and women gather in groups, roasting and devouring the meat with gusto, somewhat reminiscent of the "powder-faced girls, cutting raw meat to eat the pungent smell" in the Dream of the Red Chamber. "Hot pot" involves using a hot pot with burning charcoal in the center, the fire is fierce and the soup is boiling. Thin slices of mutton are prepared in advance, cooked briefly in the boiling soup, then taken out and dipped into a small bowl of sauce, wine, and various spices, mixed and eaten. It's rich, flavorful, and fatty, loved by many. In all of the above, the meat and hot pots are deliberately displayed outside the door, creating a lively and steaming scene as a form of advertisement. The ancient saying "wine ponds and meat forests" can be experienced in the old capital during the autumn and winter seasons.

Beef and mutton are difficult to popularize in the Beijing market, while pork remains the mainstream meat. The word "meat" is both a general term for all meat and a specific term for pork. If one refers to beef or mutton, one must specify beef or mutton. If one simply mentions "meat," everyone knows it means pork. Chicken and duck are also meat, but they are not referred to as "meat." In restaurants, chicken shreds and duck slices do not need to be specified as chicken meat shreds and duck meat slices, which is the opposite of pork, which is only referred to as "meat," also somewhat amusing. Currently, pork cannot be obtained in the Beijing market except on the black market. Beef, mutton, goose, and duck can still be obtained in the market, but fresh beef and mutton are not abundant, and although chicken and duck are plentiful, the prices are strangely high, and the quality is old, thin, and poor, each costing five or six yuan in gold coins. The so-called price limits are ignored by merchants, and no one questions them.

A poet said: "One can eat without meat, but one cannot live without bamboo." "Meat" is used to highlight "bamboo," and dwelling is considered essential with "bamboo." This shows that "meat" is also an essential part of food. The Four Books state, "When Confucius heard the Shao music in Qi, he did not know the taste of meat for three months," using "meat" to praise the Shao music, and thus the status of "meat" is not low. Those who satirize officials say, "Those who eat meat are base," using "meat-eating" to represent "wealthy and powerful families," which has the same meaning as "behind vermillion gates, wine and meat rot, while on the road, there are frozen corpses." Not only in China, but also in the West, this is even more prevalent. Looking at wartime frugality, specific "meatless days" are designated each week, and rationing is not as vigorous as rationing "one pound of beef" and "half a pound of butter." The whole world is truly a "meat world"!

Confucians say, "A gentleman keeps away from the kitchen." It is also said, "Hearing their cries, one cannot bear to eat their meat." Buddhists believe that abstaining from killing is a blessing for humanity. Currently, the spirit of killing pervades the globe, with mutual slaughter and devouring. The lives of the people are in great peril, and life is treated like child's play. There are no intact nests, and no peaceful lin in the depths. How much different are humans from cattle, sheep, chickens, and pigs? The ways of Huang Chao and Zhang Xianzhong are widely practiced.

### Recalling the Planning and Mobilization of the Past

— Weng Wenhao

The Double Tenth National Day is a day of great commemorative value in the minds of our national citizens. Let us imagine that before the founding of the Republic of China, China was under the control of thousands of years of imperial rule. All the officials of the imperial court were still there, and the army, specifically established to suppress the people, was well-trained and well-equipped. On the side advocating revolution, funds were extremely scarce, and weapons were lacking. Comparing the two sides, the material strength was vastly different. Undoubtedly, the revolutionary leaders were determined to save the country with fervent enthusiasm. They were unafraid of hardship and danger, persevering and undaunted, demonstrating a spirit of courageous advancement. They mobilized with great effort, without retreat, striving desperately to succeed. Finally, they succeeded in one fell swoop in Wuchang, creating the foundation for the Republic of China.

At that time, Shanghai bravely initiated reforms to boost morale, many provinces responded in unison, and the people of the whole country knew that the imperial system could not survive and the Republic of China must be established. It was only this belief of the majority of the people that was as firm as steel, causing the Qing Dynasty's civil and military officials to be fearful and apprehensive, possessing weapons but daring not use them, having power but failing to take effect, fleeing in droves, leading to complete failure.

It can be seen that the cause of the establishment of the Republic of China, in terms of material strength, was precisely using weakness to control strength, using poverty to defeat wealth. In terms of psychology, it was using righteousness to overcome wrong, using the new to replace the old. Moreover, comparing material strength with psychological belief, it was truly confidence that triumphed over material power. This is a fact of great value in history.

What was this indestructible confidence? At that time, the majority of the people accepted the leadership of the revolutionary leaders. Everyone deeply believed that the corruption and incompetence of the Qing Dynasty were the root cause of harming the country, and the imperial system, with its hereditary succession, was an outdated system. To save the country, it was necessary to innovate. Everyone recalled that after the Sino-Japanese War, foreign troubles were frequent, and China could not stand on its own without self-strengthening. They also recalled the Boxer Rebellion of the Gengzi year, which was reckless and destructive, and China could not become strong without innovation. Under this belief, once mobilized, everyone was of one mind, and this became the fundamental force for creating the Republic of China.

"Although Zhou was an old state, its mandate was new." Our country's new mandate entirely depended on this spirit of sincere upward progress. This confidence was also the main reason for our long-term resistance against Japan. At that time, after the Northeast fell in the September 18th Incident, Japanese aggression intensified, from the Northeast to North China, and then from North China to Central China, nibbling away like silkworms and devouring like whales, relentlessly advancing. Our country's territorial sovereignty was under grave threat. European and American allies were only seeking to protect themselves and made no promises to aid our country. Japan was strong and we were weak, the situation was obvious. However, our leader, the current President Chiang Kai-shek, resolutely decided to resist with military force, and the entire country supported him unanimously. A surge of activity arose, and everyone worked together, preparing for a long-term war to achieve final victory. Through years of effort, and after going through hardship, our lives were difficult but our spirit did not wane, and this ultimately caused European and American countries to admire and respect us, joining forces to wage war and force Japan to surrender. The land that our country had lost over the past fifty years, Taiwan and the Northeast, were all recovered and returned to our territory. This is a clear example proving that the people's confidence can ultimately achieve its goal. Where there's a will, there's a way; this is absolutely reliable.

What is deeply regrettable is that the country's path is full of difficulties. After winning the eight-year war of resistance, there was the disturbance of the Communist Party, which still caused smoke and dust to rise everywhere, and the people were unable to make a living. Last time, in order to clearly distinguish right from wrong and jointly face the national crisis, I already clearly stated that the Chinese Communist Party, since its establishment, has always been borrowing a name to destroy and devastate, becoming a fundamental disaster that shakes the country's economy and the people's livelihood. The necessity of our country's suppression of the rebellion is no less than the Xinhai Revolution and the war of resistance against Japan. In the past, the revolution and the war of resistance both achieved victory because of everyone's deep beliefs. The key to the success or failure of the current suppression of the rebellion also lies entirely in our fully strengthening our belief in certain victory.

The current practical difficulties are certainly particularly great, but comparing the current situation with the early stages of the revolution and the war of resistance, our government's organization, the army's equipment, the financial strength, and the convenience of transportation are all far above what they were in the past. We were able to win in the past, and we certainly cannot fail today. What I am concerned about is that the people's minds must thoroughly understand what is right and wrong and what is beneficial and harmful. They must not be swayed by the Communist Party's propaganda. They must unite sincerely and act consistently. They must not contradict each other, thereby reducing our own strength. They must be firm in their confidence and have no doubt. They must not ask the blind for directions and accept the other side's lies. On this Double Tenth National Day, I would like to encourage all compatriots across the country to not forget the loyalty, courage, and enthusiasm of the past, and to not neglect the important tasks of today's era.

### Records of the Xinhai Revolution

Revolutionaries in Wuhan Rise Up

[Hankou Telegram] Wuchang has fallen.

[Hankou Telegram] Before the festival, there were rumors in the E area that revolutionaries were rising up. It was initially scheduled for the 16th (October 7th), but it was unsuccessful due to strict prevention. It was then changed to the 18th (9th), but it was detected by a secret agent, and more than twenty revolutionaries were arrested, and dozens of boxes of explosives were seized. Knowing that the matter had failed, the party members agreed with the new army to rise up hastily on the 19th. The city had few soldiers, so it fell.

Yesterday, October 10th, revolutionaries in Wuchang rose up, and all government offices below the Governor-General were bombed. The telegraph office and various barracks were also destroyed. Governor-General Rui fled to a warship. Zhang Biao led his troops out of the government office but was killed by mutinying soldiers.

[Hankou Telegram] On the 18th (October 9th), the explosives hidden by revolutionaries in the Russian concession in Hankou suddenly fell to the ground and exploded. The detectives took away two revolutionaries, and the remaining party members secretly crossed the river on the 19th and besieged the Governor-General's office, throwing bombs fiercely. The Governor-General fled, and the office was destroyed.

[Hankou Telegram] The new army in the provincial capital of Hubei mutinied. The cavalry, infantry, sappers, and engineers that were transferred to defend the Governor-General's office turned against the government when they attacked the office, fought fiercely with the defending soldiers, and then drove the defending soldiers away. The office was also burned down.

[Hankou Telegram] It is said that four civil and military officials were killed during the riots. The family members of the Governor-General of Hubei fled to a certain warship and immediately set sail to Shanghai to take refuge.

[Hankou Telegram] It is said that Huang Xing led the revolutionaries in bombarding the government offices. All the party members were brave and forward, not retreating even in death.

[Hankou Telegram] This morning (October 12th), the revolutionary army besieged the Hanyang Arsenal and then occupied it, obtaining 20,000 rifles and many field guns and mountain guns. The soldiers guarding the arsenal expressed sympathy with the revolutionaries and did not resist. The Hanyang Ironworks, which is run by merchants, is safe and undisturbed.

[Hankou Telegram] The Governor-General of Hubei, Rui Cheng, is currently stationed in Hankou, telegraphing the Cabinet, saying, "I am willing to sacrifice myself and not restore the Qing Dynasty."

[Hankou Telegram] One association of the new army artillery, two teams of cavalry, a battalion of infantry engineers, and a battalion of construction engineers mutinied at the same time. At this time, only four battalions of infantry are available.

[Hankou Telegram] The Governor-General of Hubei is still stationed on the warship Chukan, and Hankou is still quiet.

[Hankou Telegram] Zhang Biao was injured but not killed. He has escaped to the warship where the Governor-General of Hubei is stationed.

(Translated from the Zilin West Newspaper of the 12th)

[Hankou Telegram] On the afternoon of the 19th, a team of artillery, a team of infantry, and a battalion of engineers rose up in Wuchang and occupied the city. The Governor-General fled to a Chinese gunboat, and Zhang Biao fled to Hankou. They are currently attacking the Governor-General's office fiercely. It is said that a branch of the revolutionary army has gone to Hanyang. The overall situation is extremely critical. The people of various countries residing here have organized volunteer teams. The Japanese gunboat Sumida has gone to Wuhan. It is now feared that Hankou will also be affected. (Translated from the Wenhui Newspaper of the 11th)

[Hankou Telegram] Fighting is still ongoing in Wuchang, but at present, they are mostly engaged in searching for Manchus. The leader of the revolutionaries issued a proclamation, the main points of which are to expel the Manchus. The revolutionary government is responsible for protecting foreigners and the concessions of various countries, and those who violate this will be put to death. Yesterday, there was a rumor that Zhang Biao had died, but it is not yet confirmed. Chinese gunboats are now preparing for war. (Translated from the Wenhui Newspaper of the 20th) (The above telegrams were all published on October 13th)

[Hankou Telegram] The Hankou Mint and the Hanyang Steelworks have been occupied by the revolutionary army.

[Hankou Telegram] Last night, in the Chinese area of Hankou, bandits took the opportunity to set fires, which spread fiercely. The revolutionaries helped to extinguish the fires and then occupied the Chinese area, and immediately issued announcements to reassure the people, saying, "To prevent bandits from disturbing the safety of the people."

[Hankou Telegram] All the defense forces in Hankou have surrendered. Two battalions of the Bian army of the revolutionaries have arrived in Hubei. 12,000 men of the Beiyang Army are coming.

Hanyang and Hankou are now quiet. (Translated from the Wenhui Newspaper of October 12th)

[Hankou Telegram] The overall situation remains unchanged. Chinese gunboats that have not rebelled are patrolling the river, opening fire on the revolutionary army in Hanyang, as if the gunboats are also firing on Wuchang. According to Chinese sources, the Beijing-Hankou Railway has been destroyed by the revolutionaries 40 miles away from Hankou. (Translated from the Wenhui Newspaper of October 12th)

[Hankou Telegram] Yesterday, the revolutionaries occupied Wuchang, but many places in the city were burned. About two battalions of soldiers who have not rebelled are commanded by Zhang Biao. This morning, they left Wuchang and landed at the head of the Japanese concession. 500 soldiers from Shashi and Yichang have rushed back to Hankou on the Daji Maru, but these troops are the old subordinates of the revolutionary leader Li Yuanhong. (Translated from the Wenhui Newspaper of October 12th)

[Hankou Telegram] There is a large fire in the Chinese area of Hankou. (Southern Telegram, Wenhui Newspaper, October 12th)

[Hankou Telegram] Many revolutionaries from Wuchang have arrived in Hankou and occupied the Dazhi Gate, and are now destroying the railway station on the riverbank. The official troops who have not rebelled are now waiting for the Bian army to arrive and will fight the revolutionaries in the middle of the Dazhi Gate and the riverbank station. The Japanese have organized a volunteer team and are working with people from various countries to protect the area. (The above telegrams were published on October 14th)

[Hankou Telegram] It is said that the revolutionary army has sunk a Chinese warship, and the remaining ships are cruising downstream.

[Hankou Telegram] The warships had already opened fire to attack the city, but the revolutionary army set up artillery to the north and fired back fiercely. Fearing that the Governor-General would be lost on the ship and that the concessions would be affected, they stopped firing again. (The above was published on October 15th)

The Capital is Shocked and Merchants Devise Countermeasures

[Beijing Telegram] The Cabinet and the Military Advisory Office have received urgent telegrams from Hubei Province that the new army has rebelled and Wuchang has fallen, and that Brigade Commander Zhang Biao has been killed. (Published on October 12th)

[Beijing Telegram] Governor-General Rui telegraphed on the 18th (October 9th), saying that he had seized many revolutionary documents, including plans to use Hubei as a base for military operations, and then to advance on Hunan and the provinces of the Yangtze River basin. He also requested that the 1st Zhen of the Tianjin Army be sent to Hankou immediately.

[Beijing Telegram] When the news of the Hubei rebellion arrived, the capital was greatly shocked. The 1st and 2nd Zhen of the Army took special trains to Hankou on the night of the 20th (11th). Yinchang was ordered to personally go and direct operations and will leave Beijing tomorrow (13th). Sa Zhenbing and Cheng Yonghe were also ordered to lead the entire Jiang fleet to Hubei. Governor-General Rui Cheng of Hubei was dismissed from his post, but was allowed to redeem himself by performing meritorious service.

[Beijing Telegram] The Beijing political circles are paying close attention to the Hubei situation. Defense forces have been increased everywhere, especially in the residences of the Prince Regent and other relatives of the imperial family. It is now being discussed that if the situation in the provinces worsens, martial law will be imposed throughout Beijing. (Translated from the Dadeh He telegram of the 12th) (The above telegrams were all published on October 13th)

[Beijing Telegram] Yesterday, an imperial edict was sent to Baoding to transfer troops, who returned to Beijing at 4:00 am. At 5:00 am, an imperial conference was held regarding the Hubei rebellion. Because most of the Hubei army surrendered to the revolutionaries, an imperial edict was issued to send two battalions of the Imperial Guards and the Han Army to Hankou today (13th) to assist in the suppression.

[Beijing Telegram] The Prince Regent instructed Yinchang to order all the troops to strictly observe discipline, both suppress and appease, to win the hearts of the people. Yinchang presented six strategies to recover Wuchang, which were approved for implementation.

[Beijing Telegram] All parties here are very alarmed by the Wuchang mutiny. The Cabinet held a special meeting this afternoon. The government has encountered extremely difficult things, and a slight carelessness will determine its fate. Yinchang was ordered to go to Hankou to supervise the army. The 6th and 4th Zhen, currently stationed in the north of Beijing, will be transported south by express train. Military movements are now being kept strictly secret to prevent the revolutionaries from destroying the railway. The railway south of Zhumadian has been managed by military officers, preventing ordinary cars from traveling, but the revolutionaries may bomb the Yellow River Bridge to prevent traffic. It is rumored that Sichuan is now in turmoil again, showing how widespread the revolutionaries have become. All the major officials in China are afraid that Guangzhou will rise up again. Beijing is under high alert. Special police officers have been selected today to protect the palace with guns. The grand parade on the 25th may be stopped. The Prince Regent has stopped summoning minor officials, apparently fearing that revolutionaries may have infiltrated. The diplomatic corps is paying close attention to the Hubei rebellion, and many have gone to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inquire about the details, knowing that foreigners in Wuhan are currently safe. (Translated from the Continental Daily telegram of the 12th) (The above telegrams were all published on October 14th)

[Beijing Telegram] An imperial edict has been issued to reinstate Yuan Shikai as the Governor-General of Huguang and Cen Chunxuan as the Governor-General of Sichuan, ordering them to take office immediately and quickly suppress the rebellion.

[Beijing Telegram] A telegram was sent to the Governor of Henan, Xianru, instructing him to quickly select elite troops to be stationed at the Yellow River Bridge on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, and the Ministry of the Army was instructed to send the 3rd Zhen of the Army to assist in the defense, in order to prevent the revolutionary army from spying on the north.

[Beijing Telegram] A telegram was sent to the Governors of Hunan and Shanxi instructing them to quickly select two battalions of the new army to go to Hubei and be stationed on the provincial border, in order to intercept the revolutionary army from disturbing the area, and to wait for Yinchang to arrive in Hubei to dispatch and jointly suppress the rebellion.

[Beijing Telegram] Yinchang set off with the 1st Zhen of the Army today (14th). (The above telegrams were all published on October 15th)

[Hankou Telegram] As the Beiyang Army is approaching, the revolutionaries have sent 2,000 men to guard the Hankou railway station and are transferring party troops to cross the river one after another, preparing for war.

[Hankou Telegram] The revolutionaries set up artillery on the top of Taiping Mountain to bombard Chinese warships. The sailors returned fire, and the shells fell into Wuchang city.

[Hankou Telegram] It is rumored that three Chinese warships, whose crew members and soldiers have colluded with the revolutionaries, are willing to surrender.

[Beijing Telegram] The Ministries of Posts and Army have jointly decided that the Beijing-Hankou Railway south of Zhumadian will be temporarily managed by military officers to prevent the revolutionaries from secretly destroying it, in order to facilitate troop movements.

[Wuhu Telegram] Commander Cen Yun and the family members of Governor-General Rui sailed down on the Taiyou Wheel this morning (22nd). Jiang Ti Cheng Yunhe sailed up on the Jiang Heng warship. Wuhu is under martial law.

[Anqing Telegram] Governor of Anhui, Zhu Jiabao, informed all sectors to quickly organize civil defense groups to prevent unforeseen events due to the military mutiny in Hubei Province. It was established tonight (22nd). (The above was published on October 13th)

[Hankou Telegram] The railway has not been cut off, and express trains have already left for Beijing. Everything is quiet in Hankou. The three places occupied by the revolutionaries are very well organized. The shops in Wuchang have already opened for business and are protected by the revolutionary army. The Beiyang Army has arrived and is at war with the revolutionaries. It is said that the army commanded by Yinchang has a total of 12,000 men. The financial market is greatly disrupted. (Translated from the Wenhui Newspaper of the 13th, published on the 14th)

[Hankou Telegram] Two battalions of Wang Biao's new army, totaling 5,000 men, were transported to Jiujiang by warship today (14th) for reserve use. (Published on October 15th)

[Hankou Telegram] The revolutionary army has sent 15,000 troops to Zhumadian in Xinyang Prefecture to be stationed there, preparing to meet the northern army.

[Hankou Telegram] The revolutionary army has sent troops to occupy Wusheng Pass to block the northern army from entering Hubei.

[Hankou Telegram] The number of soldiers and civilians who have surrendered to the revolutionaries has reached more than 30,000. Even the soldiers who had previously fled have returned in droves. Therefore, most of the revolutionary army has received military education. (The above telegrams were all published on October 16th)

### Core Work of Revolutionary Nation-Building

— He Yingqin

The work of revolutionary nation-building is of unparalleled difficulty and complexity. Thanks to the inspiring spirit of the Founding Father, the outstanding leadership of the President, and the courageous sacrifice of revolutionary martyrs and all the military and civilian compatriots, the revolutionary cause of the Three Principles of the People has been largely accomplished. Currently, the communist bandits are the last obstacle to the success of the revolution and the final stumbling block to the nation-building cause. We must all, with the ambition and spirit of revolutionaries, devote ourselves to the implementation of total war and the promotion of the frugal nation-building pact in our respective positions to sanction the treacherous and insidious communist bandits and ensure the victory of suppressing the rebellion and the success of nation-building. As long as the bandit scourge is eradicated, the country can enter a state of peace and prosperity, and our annual National Day commemoration will henceforth further promote its historical significance.

### Anecdotes of the Double Tenth

— This newspaper's archives

Fifty Bullets Overthrew the Qing Dynasty

The Wuchang Uprising was launched in haste, and various preparations and communications were not sufficient in advance, but the result was a success, which shows the trend of popular sentiment. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the Premier said in his training speech at the Whampoa Military Academy:

At that time, there were only about three hundred revolutionaries in Wuchang and Hankou, and only a few dozen real revolutionaries. All the guns had no bullets. They searched everywhere temporarily, and there were only two plates of bullets, a total of only fifty bullets. The revolutionaries were divided into fifty bullets, and they launched an attack in the engineering camp in the city, and the artillery battalion outside the city immediately responded. ... The revolutionaries only used dozens of people to fight more than 20,000 people, which can be said to be one person fighting five hundred people..."

According to the first attack, the engineering battalion in the city was the Eighth Battalion's left team led by Xiong Bingkun. At that time, the three martyrs Peng Chufan, Liu Yaozheng, and Yang Hongsheng were captured and killed by Ruizheng. The party members in the army were deeply afraid of exposure, and everyone was on guard, and the organization had been cracked and the roster had been checked. There was no way to wait until all preparations were completed before launching the attack, so they launched the attack in haste. Unexpectedly, as soon as the gunshots rang out, all the troops responded, and the Manchu officials immediately fled with their heads in their hands, and did not encounter any resistance, and the Republic of China was created from this.

The Story of the Qing Dynasty's Doomsday Prophecy

After the success of the Wuhan Uprising, Yuan Shikai was ordered by the Qing court to lead his troops south. Yuan was very superstitious. Before leaving, he asked a fortune teller to predict the fortune of this trip. The fortune teller said it would be very auspicious, so he left. The Hubei Military Government then wrote to Yuan, advising him not to work for the Qing Dynasty, and also explained the principles of divination, which was very interesting and also a talking point in the history of the founding of the Republic of China. The original book was quite fearful, and the following are a few excerpts:

"...I heard that you are going south under the orders of the Manchu court this time (referring to the southern expedition to supervise the army on September 11), you declined repeatedly, hesitated and considered three times, and even with the urging of Ruan Zhongshu and Yin Mao, you still did not decide immediately, and then you summoned a fortune teller to predict it. The fortune teller said that this trip would definitely establish a great cause, and then you started your journey. The words of the fortune teller have no value. You probably listened to it because of your gains and losses. Although you have the wonderful use of a hero, it is not as good as the ancients who used three obediences and two froms. If you really predict the direction of the hearts of 400 million people today, you should realize that the so-called great cause should be in the Republic of China, not in the dying Manchu court.

Do you really believe in astrology and prophecy? Then the folk songs and ancient prophecies circulating in our country were estimated by the people with foresight, and their predictions have been clearly confirmed today. Why don't you examine them? For example, "Holding a steel knife ninety-nine, only when everyone is killed will they stop." Do you know how to explain it? We also didn't understand it at first, but after the Manchu court's edict on the 21st of last month, the words "revolutionary party" suddenly appeared in it. Our clever people pointed it out, and we suddenly realized that there was a test. The word "revolutionary" has nine strokes, and the word "party" has nineteen strokes, which is the so-called "ninety-nine." Isn't it more obvious that the Hu Dynasty is coming to an end? Another example is "Continuing the rule in a remote area for thirty-six, the flags are divided into eight sides to Qin Prefecture," which is also a secret prophecy. Today, someone has also made a judgment on it. "Rule" refers to Emperor Xuantong, as everyone knows. "Remaining in a remote area for thirty-six" means that he can live in a remote area for thirty-six months, which is a clear sign that the Hu Dynasty will end in the third year of Xuantong. "Thirty-six" is a variant of three years. "Flags are divided into eight sides" means that the Eight Banners are scattered, and "Qin Prefecture" does not refer to Guanzhong. Now that Guanzhong is owned by the Republic of China, how can the chariot of the Gengzi Incident be stationed there again? "Qin" is an incomplete pictograph of the two characters "Fengtian," which means that the Manchu emperor will eventually be displaced in this Fengtian with incomplete sovereignty. In recent days, letters have come from Beijing saying that the Manchu Empress Dowager will flee to Fengtian. Isn't this a pre-determined sign? However, this secret record was not originally intended by us to advocate to fool the people. It is just that we heard that you recently believed in astrology and prophecy, so we chatted about it to get a smile, and also to clarify a proof of the end of history.

"However, the above is by no means the reason for our uprising this time. Because you are confused by omens and are afraid of gains and losses, we do not hesitate to break the rules and say a word for you, hoping that you will know that destiny belongs to you early, or you will not act recklessly on your own clever plans, be deceived for life, and fall into the evil crime of losing your body and the public. This is the intention of Guan and others to enlighten you..."

The Revive China Society was founded in Honolulu in 1894, eighteen years before the founding of the Republic of China, and was the earliest Chinese revolutionary organization. At that time, ten articles of association were established, revealing its nature and purpose, the main points of which are as follows:

1. The name of the society should be correct. The name of this society is "Revive China Society," and the general assembly is located in China, and branch associations are located in various places.

2. The purpose should be clear. The purpose of the society is to connect Chinese people with lofty ideals at home and abroad, to study the science of wealth and strength, to revive China, and to maintain the national system. The reason why China's politics is becoming more and more non-existent, its principles are becoming more and more corrupt, and strong neighbors are despising the people is that everyone's hearts are not the same, and they only care about their current private interests, and do not care about the long-term overall situation. If China is divided by others, then our children and grandchildren will be slaves for generations, and their lives and property will not be guaranteed. There is nothing more urgent than this! But the whole country is indignant, but no one realizes it, no one saves it! Unite the wise and the foolish into one heart, unite the near and the far into one virtue, and pool our efforts to overcome great difficulties: then although China is in danger, it can be saved. The so-called people are the foundation of the country, and when the foundation is strong, the country is peaceful.

3. The ambition should be determined. The affairs to be determined by this society must be beneficial to the country and the people before they can be carried out: in order to assist the country above and achieve prosperity; and to protect the common people below and eliminate harshness. We must ensure that the 400 million people of China can each get what they want before we can be satisfied. If there are any who use this as an excuse to engage in fraud, form gangs for private gain, or divide boundaries and discriminate against each other, these are not the ambitions of this society: they should be resolutely eliminated in order to be fair and prevent abuses.

4. Personnel should be obtained. This society shall publicly hold personnel management once a year, and must select those with both good character and learning and those with comprehensive talent.

5. Friendship should be selective. This society shall only receive members who are recommended by two old members, and after the board of directors has judged that their hearts are bright, they are truly loyal and righteous, and they are sincerely concerned about their motherland and maintain China, so as to achieve a strong and prosperous place.

6. Branch associations should be widespread. People with lofty ideals from all directions can follow the articles of association and establish their own associations everywhere.

7. Talents should be gathered. This society is in urgent need of talents. Members are scattered in all directions, and they should always and everywhere seek out virtuous talents. Regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign, if they are sincerely interested in benefiting the world and are willing to do their best for China, they can be admitted to the society.

8. Funds should be raised. The affairs managed by this society are of great importance, and a large amount of funds is required. Therefore, a silver association is specially established to raise funds to meet the urgent needs of the public and to provide a shortcut for shareholders to make money, which is a good deed that benefits both parties.

9. Public places should be established. Each branch association should establish a public place for members to work and for friends to talk from time to time, to discuss good methods for reviving China, to discuss current events, to study the politics of various countries, to express their own opinions, and to encourage each other to make progress. They must not engage in gambling games here, or do anything useless.

10. Flexibility should be good. Each clause is the outline for the opening of this society. Each branch association should make flexible changes according to local conditions and establish separate regulations to ensure that they are appropriate.

(2) Record of the Establishment of the Revolutionary Alliance

The Revolutionary Alliance was established in Tokyo, Japan, seven years before the founding of the Republic of China. According to Tian Tong's "The Establishment of the Revolutionary Alliance," an article in the first issue of the first volume of "Taiping Magazine," the establishment process is briefly described as follows:

In the summer of the year Yi Si, Sun Gong was about to come to Japan, and the comrades were excited. After arriving in Yokohama, Cheng Jiaquan conveyed the news again. Many students in Tokyo traveled between Tokyo and Yokohama. Sun Gong treated the virtuous with courtesy and also provided meals and lodging, personally holding a washbasin to wash the guests. The students in Tokyo held a welcome meeting at the Fujimiro, and many people attended. In the meeting, he gave a speech on the republican government. Wu Kun wrote it down, and the students were greatly moved, and the applause was thunderous. Then, a preparatory meeting of the Revolutionary Alliance was held at Cheng Jiaquan's residence in Iidamachi, with eight or nine people attending. They discussed various matters and the name of the society. Sun Gong advocated naming it the "Chinese Revolutionary Party," but Huang Gong said that this name would make it inconvenient for party members to act. After discussion, it was decided to name it the "Chinese Revolutionary Alliance." The oath format is as follows:

Oath taker, so-and-so from so-and-so province, so-and-so prefecture, so-and-so county, so-and-so, swears today to expel the Tartars, restore China, establish a republic, equalize land ownership, be faithful and loyal, and have a beginning and an end. If I violate this, I will be punished by the public. Member of the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance, so-and-so

Introducer, so-and-so

Heavenly Luck Year Month Day

The next day, a founding meeting was held at the residence of Uchida Ryohei in Hinokicho, Akasaka Ward, with more than 40 people attending. Everyone danced happily. Suddenly, Zhang Mingyi from Hunan said that the name was inappropriate and that the name should be established for the object since we have the ambition to overthrow the Manchu court. Sun said, it is not necessary, the Manchu government is corrupt, and we are therefore revolutionizing. Even if the Manchus sympathize with us, they can be allowed to join the party. Cao Yabo stood up and said, everyone advocates revolution today, and came here to start it. If there are any dissenting opinions, why come? Brothers, with a clear conscience, I will sign first, and everyone agreed, and each wrote an oath. The weather was hot that day, which was the 24th day of the sixth lunar month and the end of July of the new calendar. Uchida's servant brought cool cakes, and the comrades ate them heartily. In the laughter, the straw mat and wooden pillow were broken. The cups and plates were overturned, and some comrades fell to the ground. Sun Gong said, this is a sign of the overthrow of the Manchu government, and everyone rejoiced. Huang Xing, Jiang Zungui, Cheng Jiaquan, Ma Junwu and others were elected as drafters, and Sun Gong naturally participated in it. The main purpose of the regulations is to take the separation of powers, (1) the Executive Department, which is led by the Premier to manage affairs, and is divided into the General Affairs Department, the Secretariat Department, the Internal Affairs Department, the Foreign Affairs Department, the Accounting Department, and the Management Department. (2) The Deliberative Department, in which the councilors elect a speaker, and the speaker designates one councilor as the secretary. (3) The Judicial Department, with one chief, two judges, and one prosecutor. (4) Each provincial branch shall have one branch president. Several days later, a cadre election meeting was held at the residence of Viscount Banchamoto Kanemi in Reinan Saka. Huang Gong suggested that the comrades should consider that the position of Premier should belong to Sun Gong, which can save procedures and there is no need to vote. Everyone agreed, and Sun Gong was elected Premier, and Huang Gong was elected General Affairs. The remaining personnel of the Executive Department were gradually established, some were elected, and some were not elected. The councilors of the Deliberative Department were all elected at once, and the chiefs of the Judicial Department and the provincial branches were also elected later.

(3) Edict of Abdication of Emperor Xuantong

I, with reverence, have received the Edict of the Empress Dowager Longyu. Previously, due to the uprising of the people's army and the response from various provinces, the nine summers were boiling and the people were suffering. I specially ordered Yuan Shikai to send members to discuss the overall situation with the representatives of the Republic of China and to convene a parliament to make a public decision on the form of government. Since February, there has been no definite solution. The north and the south are separated and support each other. The negotiations have stopped on the way, and the soldiers are exposed in the wild. Only because the form of government is not decided for a day, the people's livelihood is not peaceful for a day. Now, the psychology of the people throughout the country is mostly inclined to the republic. The provinces in the south have advocated it in the past, and the generals in the north have also advocated it in the future. The direction of the people's hearts is known by Heaven. How can I bear to oppose the likes and dislikes of the people for the sake of the honor of one surname? Therefore, I observe the general situation externally and examine the feelings internally, and specially lead the emperor to return the ruling power to the whole country and set it as a republican constitutional government, to comfort the people in the country who are tired of chaos and hope for peace, and to learn from the ancient sages' meaning of the world for the public. Yuan Shikai was previously elected as Prime Minister by the Zizhengyuan. At this time of transition from the old to the new, there should be a way to unify the north and the south. Yuan Shikai should organize a provisional government and negotiate with the people's army on a unified plan, so that the people can live in peace and the country can be safe again. The five ethnic groups of Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan should still be completely integrated into a great Republic of China. I and the emperor can retreat to a wide and leisurely place, enjoy the years in peace, and receive the preferential treatment of the people for a long time, and witness the completion of Zhi Zhi. Isn't that beautiful? This is the order!

The date of the promulgation of the right edict was December 25, the third year of Xuantong, that is, February 5, the first year of the Republic of China.

(4) Zhang Puquan's Memoirs

Zhang Puquan's memoirs said: "On January 3, the third year of Xuantong, the Prime Minister went to Belgium. In May, I went to London. In the summer, I traveled to Switzerland with Wu Bigang, first living in Wengen, at the foot of the Jungfrau, and then moved to Grindelwald. In the autumn, the Wuchang Uprising broke out. The French were very excited to hear about the Chinese revolution. I took two or three friends and walked on the street. Four or five workers walked out of the hotel, took off their hats and shouted 'Long live China!' It can be seen that those who used to despise the Chinese have also changed their attitudes. I returned to China in November. When I arrived in Singapore, I heard that there were two factions in our party, one was the Revolutionary Alliance, and the other was the Restoration Society. I gathered people from both factions to drink together and explained the great righteousness. The main point is to avoid infighting among comrades on the day of the revolution's success. When I arrived in Shanghai, I heard that our army in Hankou had been defeated and the situation was very dangerous. Soon, the Prime Minister returned from overseas, and the morale was greatly boosted. I gave a lecture in a certain theater to raise funds for the revolutionary army. The women in the two boxes took off their gold and silver jewelry and threw them on the stage, which shows the excitement of the people's hearts. Ying Shi gathered wealthy merchants from Huzhou in a certain guild hall one day for the sake of raising funds, and closed the door, and they had to pay money. Ying Shi ordered me to give a speech."

(5) Provisional Grand President's Letter to Friendly Nations

Ever since the Manchus came to power, they have used supreme authority to impose unreasonable oppression, curtail civil rights, and resist public opinion. The intellectual, moral, and livelihood progress of our Republic of China has been delayed as a result. People of insight say that revolution is necessary to eliminate old filth and revitalize new opportunities. Fortunately, the banner of justice has been raised and the overall situation is about to be settled. We, the entire Republic of China, dare to announce to our friendly nations that we will overthrow the autocratic government of the Manchu Qing Dynasty and establish a republican republic.

Replacing the monarchy with a republic is not just a momentary anger of our people. Freedom is endowed by Heaven, and we have long yearned for it. We pray for lasting happiness and sweep away the obstacles in the future. We have cherished this small wish for a long time, but it has not been achieved. Today's events are the result of natural occurrence, and they are also the formal expression of the public opinion of our Republic.

Our Chinese nation is peaceful and law-abiding by nature. We will never lightly start a war unless we have no other choice but to defend ourselves. Therefore, since the Manchu Qing Dynasty stole China, for 168 years, the atrocities are too numerous to record. Our nation can only endure it and does not want to see the tragedy of bloodshed. We have risen up repeatedly, but it is difficult to achieve our goals. Today, we can no longer endure it, so we resort to force, hoping to free ourselves and our descendants from the shackles, and let freedom and happiness shine all over the world. It cannot be said that it is not a rare event in thousands of years.

The policy of the Manchu Qing government, to put it bluntly, is a tyrannical policy of jealousy of other races, selfishness, and unchangeable cruelty. We have suffered from it for a long time, and it is only natural that we have resorted to revolution. Destroying the old system and establishing a new country is something that we have to do. I would like to explain it to all the free nations of the world.

Before the Manchu Qing Dynasty stole the artifact, the civilized country of the Xia Dynasty allowed all countries in the world to communicate with each other and declare the freedom of religion. When the Ming Dynasty lost power, the Manchu barbarians came to power. Based on their narrow-mindedness and selfish prejudices, they set up various government orders to close themselves off and prevent the civilization of China from coming into contact with the countries of the world. As a result, the descendants of the gods are becoming more and more wild, and their natural abilities are difficult to develop. The people are imprisoned in ignorance. This is not only an obstacle to humanity, but also a public enemy of civilized countries.

Not only that, the Manchu Qing government wanted to keep the majority of the Han people permanently subservient to its autocracy, so that it could own wealth, cultivate and reproduce in it. Therefore, it did not hesitate to harm our people in order to benefit itself. The close relatives of the clan often had special privileges, and the majority of the civilians were subject to their control. It also levied exorbitant and illegal taxes and arbitrarily demanded them, which was close to robbery. It hindered the development of domestic business and hindered the prosperity of the colonial industry. The Manchu government did not know how to reward and protect the industry.

As for the use of people and administration, there is no principle of great justice. The harsh criminal system is inhuman. Selling official positions and granting titles, and politics is accomplished by bribery. The edicts are issued in the morning, and they are immediately violated in the evening, playing with our people, and it is not just once. Sitting and letting our country and our people be despised by the world, and they are almost unmoved by it.

We now want to eliminate the above-mentioned evils, so that our Republic of China can maintain friendly relations with all the countries in the world. Therefore, we do not hesitate to sacrifice our lives and fight against the evil government, and build a good one in its place. Therefore, I lay it out before the nations, and I hope that my friendly nations will take note of it. President of the Provisional Republic of China, I am related to Wen (signature).

### Anecdotes of the Double Tenth

— This newspaper's archives

The Mystery of Li Yuanhong's Coming to Power

After Wuchang was occupied by the people's army, the revolutionaries negotiated in the Consultative Bureau to form a military and political department and elect a governor. However, due to the suddenness of the incident, party members with qualifications such as Liu Zhongwen, Liu Ying, Huang Keqiang, and Juju were not in Wuchang. The leaders of the various armies were too young to be summoned, and the situation was urgent, so it was not appropriate to be without a leader for a long time. Therefore, Li Yuanhong, the "good old man" of the 21st Mixed Brigade, who was not a member of the Revolutionary Party, was elected as the governor. Li's coming to power was not voluntary. According to Wen Gongzhi's "History of the Founding of the Republic of China" and Zou Lu's "Draft History of the Chinese Kuomintang," Li was dragged out from under the bed of Li's house by the party member Jiji Min. Zhang Nanxian's "Records of the Hubei Revolution" said that he was found by Ma Rong and Tang Qifa in the bedroom of Li's staff Liu Wenji. However, the Englishman Edwin J. Dingle said in his book "China's Revolution 1911-1912": "The Chinese Revolution is one of the most shocking epoch-making events in the history of the world. If Li Yuanhong, who is currently known to everyone in the world, was not there at that time, the revolution may not have broken out. History proves that only Li Yuanhong is the greatest reformer in China and the world? ..." I don't know if this gentleman is unaware of the facts or deliberately distorting them. Because regarding this matter, Li Yuanhong himself once sent a letter to Sa Zhenbing afterwards, which said:

"When the Wuchang Incident happened, the troops under Hong's command had already gone out to defend, and he was guarding the empty camp alone and was helpless. After the Party Army drove Supervisor Rui out of the city, they immediately led a team to Hong's camp, surrounded and searched. Hong changed into casual clothes and hid in the room, but was arrested. He was charged with righteousness. At that time, guns and cannons were lined up all around. If he didn't obey, he would be killed. Hong had to agree temporarily. My teacher knows that Hong is the most cautious and honest. How dare he do this rashly? ..."

From this, it can be seen that Li himself also admitted that he had "hidden in the room in casual clothes" at that time. As for saying that he was dragged out from under the bed, it may be an exaggeration by later generations, which is also unknown.

Historical Stories of the National Name and National Seal

After the Xinhai Restoration, the party members had different opinions on the official naming of the Republic of China. Some advocated setting it as "Great Han Country," and some advocated setting it as "Great Han Republic," all of which came from the change of the four characters "Great Qing Empire." Some people also advocated setting it as "Chinese Republic." When the Senate was established, the name "Republic of China" was determined.

The earliest person to propose the name "Republic of China" was Mr. Zhang Taiyan. Zhang once wrote an article in the "Min Bao" entitled "Explanation of the Republic of China," in which he extensively cited and explained the four characters in detail. The article said:

"The name of China is used to refer to the four Yi tribes. India also calls Magadha China, and Japan also calls Sanyang China. This is not unique to the Han land. If we talk about the Han land in terms of the Han land, then the name of China is bounded by the prefectures and counties of the pre-Han Dynasty. ... The name of the Chinese people is used to refer to the place where the ethnic group first arrived. The world says that Kunlun is the Chinese country, which is obtained by analogy with other things. Whether the former emperors of China ever established their capital in Kunlun, there is no clear evidence in history, and it is not enough to use it as evidence. However, the spirit of the gods comes from the West, and takes Yong and Liang prefectures as the foundation. Fuxi was born in Chengyi, Shennong was born in Jiangshui, and the Yellow Emperor lived in Qiaoshan. These are all the lands of Yong Prefecture. Gaoyang started in Ruoshui, Gaoxin started in Jiangshui, Shun lived in Xicheng, and Yu was born in Shiniu. These are all the lands of Liang Prefecture. By observing the birthplaces of the emperors, we can know that the core area of the ethnic group is the root. The land of Yong Prefecture extends southeast to Huaxian. The land of Liang Prefecture extends northeast to Huayang. By defining the boundary with Mount Hua, and naming the country Hua, the origin is like this..."

It can be seen that Mr. Taiyan named the two characters "China." "China" refers to the different countries outside the four borders, and "Hua" is because the ethnic group originated in Mount Hua, so it is used as the name of the founding of the country.

As for the national seal, the alliance used old jade, with the text "Seal of the Republic of China," two inches and seven minutes high, and two inches and six minutes wide. It was treated by the jade master Lu, and at that time, Yuan Shuaifu's secretary Lian Shenghai was specially appointed as the ink official to supervise the work. After the victory, the national government returned to the capital in triumph, and the one held by Wu Wenchang was this seal.
