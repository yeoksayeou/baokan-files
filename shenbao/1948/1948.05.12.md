### Northeast Generals Depart Beiping to Return to Defense; Battle Situation to Have Significant Developments; Chairman's Letter to Wei Lihuang Carried by Zhao Jiaxiang; Grain and Ammunition for Beiping and Jinzhou to be Airlifted to Changchun and Shenyang

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 11th] Several Northeastern generals have departed from Beiping. Zhang Zuoxiang, Ma Zhanshan, Zhao Jiaxiang, Liao Yaoxiang, Wang Tiehan, Dong Yanping, Luo Youlun, and Northeastern elders such as Mi Chunlin and Yu Jichuan, flew to Shenyang together at 2:30 PM on the 11th. Zhang Zuoxiang said, "The Northeast is in danger. We Northeasterners must go back and take a look. I will decide what to do later after I get to Shenyang." Ma Zhanshan said: Where he will be stationed in the future will also be decided after discussions with various parties in Shenyang. Zhao Jiaxiang said: It is not yet clear whether the current actions of the Communist bandits in the Northeast constitute the seventh offensive.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 11th] Zhang Zuoxiang, Ma Zhanshan, Zhao Jiaxiang, Liao Yaoxiang, Wang Tiehan, Mi Chunlin, Luo Youlun, and others arrived in Shenyang by plane at 5:00 PM on the 11th. According to relevant sources, the overall plan to save the Northeast has been finalized.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 11th] Zhao Jiaxiang refused to express his opinion on the war situation, only saying that he would report to Commander-in-Chief Wei Lihuang. Zhao's attitude seemed quite optimistic. Zhao also brought the Chairman's personal letter to Wei Lihuang.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 11th] Several Northeastern generals who went to Beijing to attend the military conference returned to their defense posts on the 11th. There will be important developments in the Northeastern war situation. It seems that the two armies are vying for the initiative in western Liaoning. The defenses of the three major strongholds of Changchun, Shenyang, and Jinzhou are becoming increasingly complete. Efforts are also being made to strengthen the transportation of grain and ammunition. The Northeast in May is entering a tense stage of gathering clouds but no rain. The enemy seems to have completed its replenishment, but is still hesitant to move forward, which is quite intriguing. A certain general said, "We are not afraid of the bandits coming to attack, but we are afraid that they will not come to attack."

[Our Pan Yang Dispatch on the 11th] The Suppression Headquarters Air Transport Office was officially established on the 11th and began operations. In order to break the deadlock and strengthen the battle, the authorities decided to airlift grain and ammunition from Beiping and Jinzhou to strongholds such as Changtao. It is expected that 30 planes will be dispatched daily, flying 90 sorties, and 20,000 tons of grain can be transported to Pan in three months.

[Our Jinzhou Dispatch on the 11th] Reports state that several squadrons of air force reinforcements have arrived in western Liaoning, possessing a majority of fighter planes and bombers. In addition, the Jin County airfield has been expanded and rebuilt and will be completed soon, becoming a major air force base in the Northeast.

[Our Pan Yang Dispatch on the 11th] The Changchun garrison launched an attack on the 10th, clearing the villages near Dafangshen and Kuanchengzi airfields, and no large groups of bandits were found.

[Our Jinzhou Dispatch on the 11th] Fan Hanjie told reporters: "The rumors that a major battle is brewing in western Liaoning are not true. Because the national army in the Liaoxi Corridor has been reorganized and deployed for a long time, the defensive and offensive posture is advantageous. The bandits know this very well and will not launch an attack rashly. Moreover, they themselves are suffering from unspeakable pain and lack good solutions. Recently, they may attempt to harass the interior of the Pass, with the target possibly being Tangshan. The national army has now deployed troops in eastern Hebei to launch a mopping-up operation, in order to assist in stabilizing North China, and then North China can powerfully assist in the development of the Northeast, so as to achieve the effect of mutual assistance."

[Our Jinzhou Dispatch on the 11th] In order to strengthen the organization and training of the people in western Liaoning, the Northeast Suppression Headquarters has specially dispatched more than 200 political workers, who will fly to Jinzhou in batches. They will carry out work in Jinzhou, Jinxi, Xingcheng, Suizhong, and Jinshi.

### Legislative Yuan Continues Preparatory Meeting; Committee Members Nominated on the Spot by Each Unit; Drafting of the Method for Electing the President and Vice President of the Yuan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] The preparatory meeting of the first Legislative Yuan under the Constitution has been held twice on the mornings of the 10th and 11th. The Drafting Committee for the Rules of Procedure also held its first meeting on the afternoon of the 11th. On the 12th and 13th, the Drafting Committee for the Rules of Procedure and the Drafting Committee for the Method of Electing the President and Vice President of the Yuan will hold meetings separately in the morning and afternoon. If progress is smooth and the two regulations can be drafted smoothly, the third preparatory meeting at 9:00 AM on the 14th will be able to quickly pass the two regulations.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] The first Legislative Yuan under the Constitution held its second preparatory meeting on the morning of the 11th. A wide-ranging discussion was held on the draft of the method for electing the President and Vice President of the Yuan. Finally, committee members were nominated to form a Drafting Committee, responsible for drafting the method. The second preparatory meeting opened at 9:40 AM, chaired by Wu Tiecheng. Lou Tongsun reported that a total of 487 committee members had registered, and 375 were present today. The minutes of the first meeting were also read. Wu Tiecheng announced that the Drafting Committee for the Rules of Procedure would meet at 3:00 PM this afternoon, and each committee member would publicly nominate one to three people as conveners. Then, he announced that discussions would be held on the method for electing the President and Vice President of the Yuan: those who requested to speak were very enthusiastic, totaling 37 people. Those who obtained the floor included committee members Wu Jingpeng, Yin Shuxian, Yu Fuxiang, Wang Puhan, Chen Ruxuan, Du Guangxun, Lu Jingshi, Huang Yuren, Hong Duanjian, Xie Chengyu, Fang Zhichao, Qiao Shushu, Huang Guoshu, Yang Dezhao, Guo Dengao, Miao Qiping, Zhang Jinyu, Chen Guyuan, Chen Haicheng, Zhang Shiyang, and others. The opinions of Yang Dagian, Wu Zhiren, Qu Zhisheng, Deng Gongxuan, Hou Shaowen, and Tian Peng were read by the Secretary-General on their behalf. There was a 20-minute break during the meeting. At 12:00 noon, it was still not finished. Zhong Tianxin proposed extending the time and stopping the speeches. Chairman Wu Tiecheng put it to a vote, and it passed with the approval of 285 people (out of 451 people in the hall). Wu then summarized the opinions of the committee members, totaling 13 points: (1) Establish a Drafting Committee for the Method of Electing the President and Vice President of the Yuan. There are two methods for generating committee members: one is to have each unit nominate one person, and the other is to have the meeting nominate seven to nine people. (2) The President and Vice President are elected separately. There are four methods: 1. If two-thirds of the attending committee members are present, the candidate who receives more than half of the votes is elected. If no one receives more than half of the votes, the three candidates with the most votes will be re-elected once, and the candidate with the most votes will be elected. 2. If more than half of the attending committee members are present, the candidate with the most votes is elected. 3. If one-fifth of the attending committee members are present, the election will proceed. 4. The defeated candidates who participated in the presidential election can still participate in the vice-presidential election. (3) Candidates are nominated by signing. (4) The single-name joint-ballot method is used for the election. (5) The secret ballot method is used. (6) The method of nominating candidates without signing names is used. (7) An election committee is organized. (8) Mutual election is changed to election. (9) The method of party nomination is used to nominate candidates. (10) Select separately from the list of all committee members, use â—‹ to circle the candidates for President, and use to circle the candidates for Vice President. (11) The President and Vice President are elected at once, and the candidates with the most votes are elected. (12) Free competition is implemented, but illegitimate methods must not be used. (13) A method for impeachment is also drafted. In addition, Hong Ruizhao pointed out during his speech that the National Government announced the implementation of the Legislative Yuan Organization Law of March 31 last year on May 1, but the law was amended on December 25 last year. This is a major error and should be resolved by the General Assembly to request the Civil Service Department to correct it. Wu Tiecheng said: Most of the committee members who spoke advocated setting up a Drafting Committee, so he first put the first point to a vote. Of the 451 committee members in the hall, 298 agreed to establish a Drafting Committee. Regarding the method of generating committee member candidates, Wu first put the proposal of nominating seven to nine people from the meeting to a vote, but only 44 people approved it, which was a minority, so it was passed that each unit should nominate one person. At 12:20, Wu announced that each unit would nominate separately on the spot, and asked Wang Yi to nominate female committee members. After 15 minutes, the committee members from each unit were nominated one by one and read out by the Secretary-General. Wu Tiecheng then announced that all units that have not yet nominated should submit the list to the Secretariat before 6:00 PM this afternoon, so that the meeting can be held on the morning of the 12th. At the meeting, one to three people will also be publicly nominated as conveners. The meeting adjourned at 12:40.

### Legislative Yuan Rules of Procedure; Nomination of Committee Members to Draft

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] The Drafting Committee for the Rules of Procedure of the Legislative Yuan held its first meeting at 3:00 PM on the 11th. 56 committee members attended, chaired by Zheng Shuwen. The committee members expressed their opinions extensively on the old rules of the Legislative Yuan during the period of political tutelage and the needs of the Legislative Yuan under the Constitution. They all believed that the former was only a government legal institution, while the latter is now the main organ of power. It not only decides on laws and regulations, but also enjoys various consent rights and questioning rights of general parliaments. The tasks and status are very different, and the old rules have no possibility of application. After studying the constitutional provisions related to the powers of the Legislative Yuan and the details of the Legislative Yuan Organization Law, a new start should be made and re-drafted. Most committee members believed that the number of votes for major matters should be strictly regulated to show solemnity. The methods for exercising consent rights should be listed in detail in a special chapter. The rules of procedure and methods of various committees should also be described in detail. Some committee members also expressed their opinions on the nature of the rules themselves, believing that they should follow the old rules of the Legislative Yuan during the period of political tutelage and follow the constitutional provisions to enact a law. Finally, it was decided to nominate seven committee members to form a drafting group. Various materials, meeting minutes, and written opinions submitted by various drafting committee members were submitted to the group for comprehensive research and to draft the first draft. As a result, Chen Guyuan (convener), Zheng Yanfen, Chen Haicheng, Du Guangxun, Tong Guansai, Dai Xiujun, Zhang Jintie and other seven committee members were elected to form the drafting group, and they will conduct research and complete the first draft as soon as possible, and submit a report at the second meeting of the Rules of Procedure Drafting Committee on the afternoon of the 12th. The meeting adjourned at about 5:00 PM.

### President Truman Sends Letter to Congress Urging Appropriation of Aid to China Funds; Aid to Europe Funds Expected to Be Handled Concurrently

[United Press Washington Dispatch on the 10th] President Truman today requested Congress to appropriate a total of $818 million in aid funds for China, Greece, Turkey, and Trieste. China will receive $463 million, of which $278 million will be used to subsidize imports necessary to maintain the national economy, $60 million will be used for rural relief and reconstruction, and $125 million will be provided as a grant. The overall foreign aid bill passed by Congress last month only authorized the government to formulate a foreign aid plan. Unless a special appropriation bill is passed separately, it will be meaningless. Regarding the $5.3 billion in aid to Europe, the President has already consulted Congress to allocate the full amount. The House Appropriations Committee is currently hearing opinions from all parties and is expected to handle the aid to China and other funds concurrently with the aid to Europe funds. No decision is likely to be made in the next few weeks.

[Associated Press Washington Dispatch on the 10th] President Truman sent a letter to House Speaker Martin on the 10th, requesting an appropriation of $818 million for the aid to China, Greece, Turkey, Trieste and other bills that have been passed. Of the total $800 million in funding Truman requested, China will receive $463 million, Greece and Turkey will receive $275 million, Trieste will receive $20 million, and the remaining $60 million will go to the International Children's Relief Fund.

### Chairman Summons Zeng Qi, Hoping for Continued Cooperation Among the Three Parties

The Social Democratic Party Holds Central Standing Committee Meeting in Shanghai

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] Chairman Chiang summoned Zeng Qi, the leader of the Youth Party, at his official residence at 10 AM on the 11th, and had another meeting on the issue of legislators. Zeng also provided some opinions. The conversation lasted for 50 minutes before it ended. The Chairman's opinion is still that he hopes that the three parties can continue to cooperate and seek a solution to the issue of legislators. He also hopes that this kind of consultation will continue, because the issue of legislators and the establishment of the new government are actually two sides of the same coin.

[Reported by This Newspaper] The issue of the number of legislators for the Social Democratic Party and the Youth Party is difficult to resolve despite the efforts of mediators. However, since Xu Chuanlin and others returned to Shanghai yesterday morning, the Central Standing Committee meeting was held at 10 AM, and all responsible personnel attended. As a result of the meeting, it was decided to maintain the previous position, and the attitude will become more resolute due to the convening of the Legislative Yuan meeting. Xu Fulin, Jiang Yuntian and others will not return to Beijing in the short term, and no one has been contacted in Nanjing on behalf of the party. It is reported that Li Qi of the Youth Party is very resolute, but Zeng Qi, who is staying in Beijing, has a more moderate attitude. In addition, after Mo Dehui came to Shanghai, he has contacted the main leaders of the Social Democratic Party and the Youth Party separately. Mo's mediation opinion is to hope that the two parties accept the Chairman's suggestion of half the number, and then discuss the rest. He has no new plan to propose himself. Regarding the consequences of the stalemate, the responsible personnel of the Social Democratic Party said that the party only has three members participating in the government, and the government will be reorganized soon, so it is natural to withdraw. Therefore, it is not necessary to reveal it at this time. When the joint statement of the two parties was issued, reporters asked Chu Xiaohuang about the Youth Party's attitude towards this matter, but he did not express it.

### Executive Yuan Meeting Passes; Partial Reorganization of Sichuan Provincial Government; Law on the Use of Names to be Sent to Legislative Yuan for Deliberation

It is reported that the regulation will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation to complete the legislative process.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 11th] After the Executive Yuan's general resignation proposal was passed by the political affairs meeting, the resignation document was submitted to the political affairs meeting on the 11th for distribution to all political committee members for signature.

In addition to Li Zongren being elected Vice President and Song Ziwen originally serving as Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, Zhang Zhizhong may be transferred to serve as Chief of Staff of the Presidential Palace. The whereabouts of Cheng and Zhu Shaoliang have not yet been determined.

Editorial

### How to Make Good Use of American Aid

Since the enactment of the American Aid to China Act, various parties have deeply concerned themselves with the question of how to utilize American aid. The authorities are also carefully considering it. This aid may have a significant impact on our country's finances, currency, prices, and various agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors. According to this Aid Act, the Sino-US exchange of letters, and the President of the United States' message to Congress requesting appropriations the other day, the allocation of American aid can be clearly determined as follows: (1) Construction projects, i.e., economic assistance, totaling US$338 million. This includes the following parts: (i) Temporary preliminary measures, i.e., proceeding with the Sino-American Relief Agreement first, until July 3 of this year, with funds advanced by the Financial Rehabilitation Bureau, not exceeding US$50 million; (ii) Economic maintenance of US$278 million, including the previous item; (iii) Rural reconstruction expenses of US$60 million. (2) Additional, i.e., so-called military assistance, stipulated not to exceed US$125 million.

The second type above is a gift. Regarding rural reconstruction expenses, it is stipulated that "US dollars, or Chinese legal tender obtained from the sale of goods, or a combination of both, may be used." Specific conditions still need to be proposed by the United States, and another agreement must be signed with our country. What is most noteworthy now is how the first type, second item, economic assistance will be used, and what kind of materials it will contain.

Section 404 of the American Aid to China Act only stipulates the amount of aid to be provided within one year and does not specify whether this amount should be paid in cash or provided in goods, or a combination of both. Although the US President's message the other day specified that it would be used to improve the import of essential goods to maintain the Chinese economy, it did not explain whether these funds would be allocated in cash or used to purchase goods for shipment to China. According to the announcement of the Economic Adjustment Special Office, the United States will first send an investigation team to China to plan the use of funds related to the restoration of industries such as electricity, railways, and mining. The items supervised by Repuhan, head of the Aid to China Mission, also include food, oil, cotton, and other industrial raw materials. Thus, it is known that cash payments will be, at most, only a part of it, and the majority will be goods. What needs to be investigated, studied, and consulted is precisely the "types of these goods and the cases and methods of procurement and distribution."

Because cash payments will only be a part, a small amount, and there is no certainty, the reform of the currency system is out of the question unless another loan is negotiated separately. Although the goods include the aforementioned food, oil, cotton, industrial raw materials, and proposed projects for roads, mines, and power plants, these are only predictions. The specific final decision will naturally be made during the Sino-US negotiation of a bilateral agreement.

What needs to be pointed out to the public first is that regardless of whether the final form of aid supplied is cash or goods, it is still goods in the end. Because providing cash is nothing more than allocating foreign exchange funds, and the payment of foreign exchange funds is still mainly for the purchase of goods, the question of which goods should be prioritized for purchase and how the quantities of various goods should be rationally allocated is a topic worth studying today.

Currently, foreign exchange is scarce, and quotas are too small, placing the import and manufacturing industries in extreme difficulty. In particular, many industries are closing factories, relocating, reducing working hours, and laying off employees due to the lack of raw materials. Therefore, we are willing to offer two principles in order to address the urgent needs: (1) Consumables, except for food, should be reduced as much as possible; (2) Emphasis should be placed on urgently needed raw materials and all necessary equipment. Because handling it this way can maintain many tottering industries and avoid much unemployment, which is more meaningful and has a more active and lasting effect than simply supplying consumables. The American Aid to China Act originally stated: "This effort will quickly achieve domestic peace and economic stability in China." Repuhan, the head of the delegation, also stated: "Anything that can develop China's production and help put China on a stable footing is a major step in the right direction." We believe that the above principles are fully consistent with the purpose and direction of preventing economic decline that friendly nations hold.

As for how to dispose of the Chinese legal tender cash obtained from the sale of American aid materials, this issue is also worth attention. According to the Sino-US exchange of letters, the materials supplied in the preliminary measures are handled according to the relief agreement: (1) for reconstruction, (2) except for agreed expenses, they should be stored in special accounts and consulted on separately later. However, it is stated that the nature of this aid is different from relief, and its use may be changed in the future after agreement between the two countries. Also, in the exchange of letters between the two countries, the United States stated: Regarding the funds for construction assistance, if repayment is required, the conditions will be determined later. Thus, except for the US$125 million for military purposes, which is definitely a gift, whether the remaining US$338 million in American aid materials should be repaid and how to repay them will be determined later. However, even if repayment is required in the future, or even full repayment is required, the deadline will not be too hasty. Within this short period, it should not be difficult to agree on temporary use, which is a very obvious fact.

We believe that this huge sum of cash is most suitable for the following two purposes: (1) Making up for the deficit and filling the national treasury's shortfall. Everyone knows that the biggest problem in the current economy is nothing more than inflation. The reason why inflation continues to increase is simply because fiscal revenue and expenditure cannot offset each other. Therefore, using these funds to make up for the deficit in public finances, although its direct effect is to stop or slow down the increase in currency issuance, its indirect effect is to stabilize prices, stabilize finances, and stabilize the overall economy. The positive and beneficial effects it produces should be greater than any other technical method. Officials have announced that only US$100 million is needed to collect all the currency in circulation, and the American aid materials that can be sold in the future are worth as much as US$338 million. Therefore, this problem should not be difficult to solve smoothly, at least for a considerable period of time, it will not always resort to the printing press!

(2) Purchasing slow-selling domestic products. There are many contradictory phenomena in the current economy, such as suffering from a shortage of materials on the one hand and suffering from overproduction on the other. This phenomenon is most evident in many export goods and certain manufactured products. The reason is that costs are too high, and the exchange rate is too unreasonable, causing exporters to be in a difficult situation, which will undoubtedly affect future reproduction and the livelihoods of the vast rural areas. As for the products of factories, such as cement, machinery, etc., because other industries are too depressed, sales are sluggish, and they are in a dilemma. Under this embarrassing situation, the state should come out to purchase them separately to alleviate the current difficulties and protect the vitality of industry and commerce. According to regulations, the current policies of ordering and purchasing goods have not failed, and many financial institutions, under the banner of controlling materials, are unfolding this method to encompass all materials. However, these many materials mentioned above are all unpopular and unprofitable. We are not in a position to speculate whether they are willing to treat them equally and be happy to purchase them. Even if they are happy to purchase, how will the capital for purchasing and ordering goods come from? Is it still necessary for the central bank to issue a large number of banknotes under the methods of re-mortgaging or rediscounting? Then, although a small number of related industrialists and merchants can obtain financing and slightly revive their dried-up tracks, the pain of inflation and soaring prices will universally fall on the general public. Isn't this helping one while hurting another? This cash obtained from the sale of American aid does not come from increasing the amount of currency in circulation, and it does not necessarily increase the burden on the treasury. If a portion can be allocated to handle purchases, to wait for the market to improve, it seems that it is not inconsistent with the purpose of stabilizing prices and stabilizing the economy.

Currently, there are many proposals from all sectors regarding the use of American aid, such as developing the southwest, opening mines, building roads, and building factories, etc. These naturally have their own profound significance. However, if the unstable situation of the economy deepens and cannot be effectively curbed, then the existing established businesses will be in danger and unable to stop. What can be said about increasing and developing? Therefore, we propose the many suggestions above, which have a value that should be given priority.

### Grain Merchants Purchase Flour for Re-export; Spokesperson of the Ministry of Food Discusses Handling Principles

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Food recently issued a statement on the issue of grain merchants purchasing flour for re-export, saying: The flour approved by the Ministry for grain merchants to re-export, especially those applying to purchase and transport in Shanghai, has recently been ordered to purchase from various flour mills and submit official invoices from the flour mills and certification documents from the local flour industry association for verification and release. The purpose is to avoid grain merchants purchasing in large quantities from the market and stimulating flour prices. Hereafter, all grain merchants purchasing flour from the Ninth Qi of Hankou and the Shanghai Fourth District Flour Industry Association, or the Shanghai Maoxin and other five factories' public agency offices, for approved re-export, regardless of the quality of the flour purchased, should sell it within the amount listed in the Ministry's approval. They must not over-sell or refuse to sell. After selling, they should issue official invoices, affix sufficient stamp duty, and hand them over to the grain merchants, along with the certification documents from their affiliated association, to be submitted to the Ministry for verification. As for the price at which the factories sell flour to grain merchants approved for re-export, it should be based on the allocation price paid by the China Trust Bureau on behalf of Tianjin and Hebei for purchasing flour from the association's factories. They must not raise the price or secretly demand fees. Otherwise, they will be dealt with for manipulating the market and promoting the black market.

### "Yangyugan" Project; Resumption of Surveying Work; Aerial Survey of the Sichuan-Hankou Railway Completed

[United Press, Nanjing, 11th] It is learned that the Chinese government is resuming surveying work on the "Yangyugan" project in the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River to build the world's largest hydroelectric power plant. This plan was once suspended last year due to a lack of funding. A portion of the US$463 million in American aid is designated for construction projects, so surveying work has been resumed. If this plan is completed, it can generate ten million kilowatts of electricity and open up three million acres of land.

### Xu Baiyuan Reports on Finance (Continued from Yesterday)

Secondly, in terms of finance, the most concerning issue for the public is how to effectively curb inflation. The unavoidable fact is that the issuance of currency is increasing due to insufficient national treasury revenue and expenditure. Therefore, striving to bring national treasury revenue and expenditure closer to balance is indeed an urgent task at present. Furthermore, comparing the index of currency issuance increase with the price index, the current index of currency issuance increase is only about one-fifth of the price increase index. The price index exceeds the currency issuance increase index by more than five times. The main reason is actually caused by the psychological misperceptions of the general public. As long as the government has a method to restore people's trust in the currency, and they do not hoard goods or seek to escape funds, then the impact of the increase in currency on prices will not be as severe as it is today.

What can most affect people's confidence in the currency is the foreign exchange market. Since the Ministry of Finance began implementing foreign exchange control in the 27th year of the Republic (1938) in accordance with government policy, the methods have undergone many evolutions and improvements. However, after reviewing the international economic situation, it seems that our foreign exchange control is not thorough enough, and the execution is not meticulous enough. In all countries of the world, except for a very few countries with abundant strength, strict foreign exchange control policies are implemented to prevent the price of the national treasury currency from being linked to the price of foreign currency. Our country's foreign exchange resources are not abundant, and the industry is lagging behind, and we urgently need to regenerate ourselves. All kinds of unnecessary consumption should be saved as much as possible, so strict foreign exchange control is a necessary measure for promoting economic policy at present. However, some non-essential consumer goods are still widely sold on the market, while some export materials that can be exchanged for foreign exchange in the country are sluggish. Also, the black market trading of foreign exchange and gold outside of the national important financial markets, although prohibitions have been repeatedly issued, is still rampant. The areas near the ports abroad, especially the dens of speculative merchants escaping funds and smuggling goods, have not been effectively isolated. Their impact on the country, these are all weaknesses in foreign exchange control, which need to be corrected by all parties.

Due to the increase in issuance, the fluctuations in prices, and the imperfect foreign exchange management, the related problem is the high rise in interest rates. In March of this year, the interest rate in the Shanghai market once rose to more than four percent per month. Recently, it has been hovering between two and a half and three percent. Inland cities have higher rates than Shanghai, and rural interest rates are even higher. During the war, the issuance gradually increased, and prices inevitably fluctuated, and interest rates tended to rise, which was a natural phenomenon. However, the result of excessively high interest rates is obviously harmful to agricultural, mining, industrial, and commercial production businesses. Also, due to high interest rate costs, it will inevitably promote price increases. In the 36th year of the Republic (1947), the average price increase was 14 times, while the increase in interest rate costs was about 8 times. This clearly shows that high interest rates are the main factor driving up prices. Especially in rural areas, the current general practice of farmers is to use in-kind loans, and the interest rate has reached more than 50%. This kind of usury is becoming increasingly common, which will inevitably lead the majority of farmers to bankruptcy. Not only has it formed a serious economic crisis, but it will also affect the implementation of public administration.

Another issue that is most closely related to financial policy is the adjustment of financial institutions. Our country has a large number of financial institutions, second only to the United States. Since the government promulgated the Emergency Economic Measures Plan in February of the 36th year of the Republic (1947), it has restricted the establishment of new banks and successively eliminated unsound financial institutions. At the end of March of this year, there were a total of 5,912 financial institutions in the country, including 2,090 general institutions and 3,822 branch institutions. If they are listed by nature, there are 4,144 national banks, provincial banks, county and city banks, and commercial banks, 1,147 money houses, 33 trust companies, and 588 insurance companies. Most financial institutions are concentrated in major cities along the Yangtze River and the coast. The Ministry of Finance has made many attempts to promote their relocation to the interior. Recently, it has established financial management bureaus in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Wuhan to regulate the business operations of banks and money houses. Judging from the current general financial and economic situation, it seems necessary to restrict the establishment of new institutions and eliminate or merge the existing institutions with weak financial strength or unsound business.

The simple analysis above is only to raise the important issues of the current financial situation. From the analysis of various facts, it can be seen that although the current financial problems are serious, improvement is not difficult. As long as the entire country works together, it is easy to reverse the trend, balance revenue and expenditure, rebuild monetary confidence, and stabilize finance within a considerable period of time. From what I can see, I believe that the following matters are particularly worth noting:

First, fiscal policy and financial policy should have a consistent direction and promote progress together. Do not haggle over small profits, and do not worry about difficulties. As for the government's economic policies and general administrative policies, they must also be closely coordinated with fiscal and financial policies, especially in terms of controlling prices and supporting the development of agriculture and industrial and mining production businesses. There must be consistent steps, and the measures should help each other and not conflict or contradict each other.

Second, in order to increase tax revenue, cut spending, and fully control foreign exchange and finance, the entire country must understand the importance of the success or failure of today's fiscal reform, sacrifice the interests of the individual, and support the demands of suppressing the rebellion. All taxes that should be paid should be paid enthusiastically. Expenses that should be cut should be cut effectively. Measures that can reduce the government's burden should be promoted in many ways. All laws and regulations related to the must-control items should be jointly observed and implemented, especially hoping for the support of public opinion organs and the press.

Third, now that constitutional government has begun, the decision-making of fiscal and financial matters should be based on public opinion, but after the policy is determined, the competent authorities should be responsible for its implementation. If obstacles can be removed and difficulties can be overcome, then fiscal reform will definitely be effective. (End)

### Observing the Annular Solar Eclipse at Ci Biwu

â€” Our Reporter Huang Xingtian

[Our Newspaper Yuhang, Ci Biwu, 9th] May 9th is an extremely precious day for the astronomical community. Astronomers and scientists around the world are full of enthusiasm and hope to welcome this annular solar eclipse.

Entering Our Country

The annular eclipse belt starts in the northeastern part of the Indian Ocean, passes north through Myanmar and Siam, and enters our country southwest of Suixi County in Guangdong, passing through Xinyi, Luoding, Deqing, Guangning, Wude, and Wengyuan counties before entering Jiangxi, passing through Nanxiong, Nankang, Ganxian, Xingguo, Nanfeng, Zixi, Shangrao, and Yushan counties into Zhejiang, passing through Dangshan, FenShui, Lin'an, Yuhang, and Deqing counties, and then through Wujiang and Haimen counties in Jiangsu, before entering the Yellow Sea, crossing southern Korea, entering the Sea of Japan, passing the northwestern tip of Hokkaido, and finally ending in the northeastern corner of the Pacific Ocean. Among them, at 40 degrees 51 minutes north latitude and 132 degrees 47 minutes east longitude in North Korea, when the shadow of the moon is closest to the Earth's surface at 2:30 Greenwich Mean Time, the distance is only eight kilometers, so a brief total solar eclipse can be seen from an airplane. Partial solar eclipses are visible throughout China except for the above-mentioned areas. In the southeast, the fraction of the sun covered reaches more than nine-tenths of the solar disk. The more northwestward, the less the fraction of the sun covered. But even at the border of Xinjiang and Mongolia, partial solar eclipses of more than three-tenths can still be seen.

A solar eclipse is the best opportunity for the scientific community to explore the mysteries of the universe. It can answer some scientific puzzles and create many new problems. The scientific community hopes to gain the following from this annular solar eclipse: (1) Using the weak light during the solar eclipse to observe whether there are new planets around the sun; (2) Calculating the accurate radius and shape of the Earth from the differences in solar eclipse times at various points in the annular eclipse belt; (3) Measuring the time of the first contact, maximum eclipse, and fourth contact, and the eclipse image. And incidentally measuring the changes in light intensity and temperature during the solar eclipse. The American Geographical Society and the military have prepared for this solar eclipse for a long time and have specially dispatched seven observation teams distributed in Myanmar, Siam, China, Korea, Japan, and the Aleutian Islands (two teams) within the annular eclipse belt. Their main goal is to take the opportunity to conduct geodetic surveys to seek the connection of the measurement networks of various countries. The Astronomical Institute of the Academia Sinica in our country has also paid attention to this solar eclipse for a long time and has specially formed an observation team with the Survey Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense. Their work has three parts: (1) Using the finder scope of the 8-inch equatorial telescope, equipped with a wooden frame that can be rotated up and down, left and right, directly photographing to measure the time of the first contact, the beginning and end of the annular eclipse, and the fourth contact; (2) On the same film, take a picture every ten minutes to capture the eclipse image from the first contact to the fourth contact (such as the one taken in Lintao, Gansu on September 21, 1941, there can be a series of eighteen suns on one photograph); (3) Using a photoelectric tube to measure the change in brightness during the solar eclipse. The observation stations of the Sino-American observation teams are all located in Ci Biwu, forty-three kilometers northeast of Hangzhou.

American Observation Team

The American observation team came to Wukang and Deqing on April 9 to find a base. As a result, it was determined that the top of Dongbu Gang in Ci Biwu, 260 meters above sea level, at 119 degrees 50 minutes 44 seconds east longitude, 30 degrees 26 minutes 25 seconds north latitude, and 2,000 meters from the annular eclipse belt path, was the best location. The team is led by Father Farncis J. Heyden, a professor at Georgetown University in the United States, assisted by Zhang YuZhe, director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academia Sinica, photographer Joe P Gray, and two assistants Sargeant Casteleans and LT. Nelson Fay. They brought radio transmitters, radios, self-recording photometers, chronometers, coelostats, movie cameras equipped with 75.5-inch focal length and 3-inch aperture telescopes, and two standard clocks (one for Greenwich Mean Time, one for local mean time). The Chinese observation team arrived in Ci Biwu three days ago, setting up a station at 119 degrees 50 minutes 30 seconds east longitude and 30 degrees 26 minutes 10 seconds north latitude, on a hillside next to the highway, headed by Chen Diyan and Chen Biao. The staff also included Shi Shiyuan, Xia Jianbai, Yin Zhongqi, Xu Dexiang, Zhou Jiayin, Jiang Bingyu, Yang Xuejun, a total of nine people. Their instruments are relatively simple, with two coelostats, two telescopes, a camera, and several types of photometers, some of which were adapted and manufactured from the sights of Japanese bombers.

No Hope of Sunrise

Yuhang was originally not a suitable place. According to Mr. Chen..., "According to our memory, in the past nine years, there has only been one sunny May 9th here." He said this when the spring sun was warm and the weather was good, but around 4 AM on the 9th, I was awakened by the sound of rain, although it was not very heavy, it did not stop until 6:30, and the layers of dark clouds never dispersed. However, Mr. Zhang YuZhe and others still mustered the courage to climb the muddy hillside and prepare their instruments on the top of the mountain. But time flew by, and there was no hope of sunrise. Father Hayden had no choice but to look up at the Chinese national flag and the Geographical Society flag on the dark sky and sighed. Their work could not be done without the sun. The Chinese observation team at the foot of the mountain was also very discouraged, but they still used photoelectric tubes to measure the change in brightness. This was the only work they could do. They recorded once every five minutes, half an hour before and after the first contact, once every minute, five minutes before and after the first contact, and once every half a minute, two minutes before and after the maximum eclipse, using arcs to indicate brightness. As a result, the first contact was measured at 9:23.4 seconds, the maximum eclipse began at 10:49:25, the darkest was at 28 seconds, the maximum eclipse ended at 32 seconds, and the fourth contact was at 12:18:11, which was consistent with the forecast. (The time calculated by the Zhejiang Provincial Meteorological Institute on Ziyang Mountain in Hangzhou was also very accurate. The first contact in Yuhang County was 9:30:26.8, the maximum eclipse was 10:49:27.5, and the fourth contact was 12:18:08.9.) The ratio of brightness before the first contact to the darkest at maximum eclipse was five hundred to one.

Precious

The observation work of the American observation team in Ci Biwu, China, failed due to the weather. The Chinese observation team also did not have any observational achievements for the same reason. But one thing that is precious is that the eclipse time theoretically calculated is very consistent with the actual situation. This proves the progress of our science. Our country in ancient times paid much attention to astronomical phenomena. The solar eclipse recorded in the "Yin Zheng" chapter of the Book of Documents dates back to before 2100 BC and is the oldest solar eclipse record in the world. The solar eclipse records in the Spring and Autumn period already have research value. In 240 years, as many as 37 solar eclipses were recorded, and most of them are consistent, which is a very valuable achievement. I hope that at the next solar eclipse nineteen years later, our own astronomical community will have even better results.

### US and Soviet Union Agree to Improve Relations and Establish Peace Through Direct Negotiations The Full Text of the Exchange of Letters Was Released Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] New York, 11th Radio: Washington Dispatch, President Truman's interpretation of Ambassador Smith's views expressed to Molotov as a reaffirmation by the United States government of its basic policy to draw the attention of the Soviet government. There is absolutely no implication of a change in policy on the part of the United States, nor is there any possibility of a meeting between the United States and the Soviet Union as a result. This action is only a reaffirmation of the US position.

[Reuters Moscow, 11th] The Soviet Union and the United States have agreed to resolve all disputes between the two countries through direct negotiations. This great development was revealed this morning after the release of two letters exchanged between US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. In a letter to Molotov on May 4, Ambassador Smith said that the current relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is a source of serious disappointment to the American people and government. As far as the United States is concerned, the door to negotiations to resolve differences is always open. Molotov replied that the Soviet government takes a positive attitude towards the US government's desire to improve relations between the two countries and agrees to the suggestion of resolving existing differences between the two countries through negotiations. Ambassador Smith's letter also stated that the concerns and determination of the American people have increased with the Soviet Union's hostile attitude towards the European Recovery Program. The United States believes that this European Recovery Program is nothing more than the reconstruction of Europe with US assistance on a common basis and does not intend to threaten anyone.

### US Policy is Firmly Established and Does Not Harbor Hostility Towards the Soviet Union

Smith's letter first put forward the following points: (1) The US government's policy in international affairs has recently been sufficiently affirmative, and most American people support this policy. The US government will continue to implement this policy vigorously in the future, and domestic political situations, such as the US elections this autumn, will have no impact on this policy. The US government is well aware that communist groups in various places are propagating the economic crisis that is about to occur in the United States, which will cause the United States to change its policy. Those who spread such remarks should know that even if the United States has an economic crisis, it will not affect the industrial capacity of the United States or the urgent factors on which its foreign policy is based. Because the problems involved in the current international situation are of great relevance to the security of the United States and global peace. (2) The US government is willing to clearly state that the United States does not harbor a hostile attitude or aggressive intentions towards the Soviet Union. The United States believes that if the Soviet Union is willing to live in peace with its neighbors and does not attempt to directly or indirectly interfere in the affairs of others, then the US policy will not have any unacceptable impact on the interests of the Soviet Union. In fact, if there were no need for the United States to assist other countries in protecting their political integrity and resisting the attempts of communist minority parties to seize power and establish regimes that are subordinate to foreign interests, then many factors in US foreign policy would not elicit such serious criticism from the Soviet Union. If these attempts by communist minority parties cease, then certain expressions in US foreign policy that cause dissatisfaction in Moscow will no longer be necessary.

Smith's letter went on to point out that the current state of US-Soviet relations is the cause of serious disappointment to the American people and government. It also said, "So far, we have not given up hope of changing policies to restore good relations between the two countries and eliminate the causes of the deterioration of the international situation. As far as the United States is concerned, the door to negotiations and the resolution of differences remains open. The US government sincerely hopes that the Soviet leaders will not ignore the US policy explained in this letter, otherwise, the United States will not lack the will and preparation to work on its own to stabilize the world situation under conditions consistent with the security of the Soviet people."

### Molotov's Reply: Statement Clarifying Treaties with Allies Did Not Include Secret Clauses

Molotov's letter stated: The Soviet government has received the US Ambassador's letter of May 4 regarding the statement on the state of US-Soviet relations. The Soviet government takes a positive attitude towards the US government's aspiration to improve relations between the two countries, and agrees to begin discussions to resolve the current differences between the two countries. However, the Soviet government also has something it must state.

The US government's assertion that the current unsatisfactory relations between the US and the Soviet Union and the tense international situation are due to the Soviet Union's policies in Eastern Europe and the expansion of Soviet influence is something the Soviet government cannot agree with. Regarding the Soviet Union's relations with its neighbors and other European countries, the Soviet Union dares to state that these relations have greatly improved since the war, as evidenced by the treaties of friendship and mutual assistance concluded between the Soviet Union and these countries. The purpose of these treaties is solely to prevent Germany or its possible allies from launching strategic attacks again, and they do not include any secret clauses. The countries that have treaties with the Soviet Union have all been ravaged by Germany and are eager to conclude such treaties. The Soviet government deeply understands that the US government is also pursuing a policy of strengthening its relations with its neighbors, such as Canada, Mexico, and other American countries. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand that the Soviet Union is pursuing the same policy in Europe, and the Soviet Union will continue to pursue the policy of strengthening its relations with these European countries in the future.

Denies Interference in Other Countries' Internal Affairs

The US government's statement also asserts that certain foreign policies adopted by the US government in some foreign countries, which have caused dissatisfaction in the Soviet Union, are the result of Soviet interference in the internal affairs of these countries, which is also something the Soviet government cannot agree with. Although there have been significant internal reforms in some Eastern European countries after the war, these are measures to prevent new threats of war and have created beneficial conditions for these countries to establish friendly relations with the Soviet Union. To say that these democratic reforms are the result of Soviet interference in their internal affairs is completely wrong, and those who say this ignore the natural result of the victory of democratic forces over fascism. The people of Eastern Europe recognize these reforms as a guarantee against new threats of war, and the people of these countries recognize communists as the most persistent fighters against new wars. Therefore, there is nothing surprising about the fact that communists have risen to leadership positions within these countries. The implementation of democratic reforms is an internal task of the country, and no one has the right to criticize it. However, judging from the US government's statement, the US government clearly has a different opinion on this matter and even allows interference in the internal affairs of other countries, which has inevitably aroused the Soviet government's serious opposition. The situation in Greece is indeed an example of such interference.

Blames the US for Deteriorating Relations

The US government also stated that the current unsatisfactory state of US-Soviet relations is due to the Soviet government's position on the so-called European Recovery Program. We must state here that if the problem of European economic recovery is not carried out in the manner of this so-called European Recovery Program, but is based on the principle of respecting national rights and sovereignty within the United Nations system, and is carried out under normal conditions of international economic cooperation, then the Soviet Union will not oppose a genuine European economic recovery program. The Soviet Union is the country that suffered the most damage during the war, and it has extreme concern and interest in the development of international economic cooperation after the war. At the same time, the Soviet government also wishes to state that the unsatisfactory state of US-Soviet relations and the tense nature of the international situation are the result of the current policies adopted by the US government. The US government's widespread construction of naval, land, and air force bases around the world, including lands adjacent to the Soviet Union, and the fact that US newspapers and some government officials have openly stated that these bases are intended to encircle the Soviet Union, are enough to encourage the creation of the current international tension. These steps by the United States cannot be justified by self-defense, nor can they be used as an excuse to engage in various military threats against the Soviet Union.

Soviet Policy Aims at Peace

On the contrary, the Soviet government has always adopted a peaceful policy towards the United States and other countries, does not establish military bases in other countries, and does not allow itself to threaten any country. Furthermore, the recent conclusion of a military alliance between the five countries of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, as well as all mutual assistance treaties concluded by the Soviet Union with Eastern European countries and Britain and France, are aimed at preventing German aggression again and are not directed against any allies. However, judging from the Western European Union Treaty, its target is not only Germany but also all the allied countries in World War II. What is even more important is that the establishment of the Western European five-nation military alliance was realized because of the US government's sponsorship. The Western European five-nation military alliance is clearly not a treaty for self-defense.

Trade Discrimination is Intolerable

Looking at US-Soviet trade relations, the unfriendly attitude of the US government towards the Soviet Union is also fully displayed. According to the US-Soviet trade agreement, the US can only impose restrictions on exports to the Soviet Union that are also applied to any other third country. However, in fact, the current policy implemented by the US government imposes discriminatory restrictions on exports to the Soviet Union, which directly violates the provisions of the US-Soviet trade agreement. Although the Soviet Union has paid part or even all of the price for goods to be shipped to the Soviet Union, it is still subject to various obstacles, and its intolerable nature is obvious. Now, the US government states that it has no hostility or intention to invade the Soviet Union, hopes to establish good relations between the two countries, eliminate international tension, and expresses its willingness to encourage the overall stability of the world situation under conditions consistent with Soviet security. The Soviet government welcomes this statement from the US government. It is well known that the Soviet government has consistently adopted a policy of peaceful cooperation with the US, and the Soviet people unanimously support this policy. The Soviet government also declares that it will continue to implement this policy in the future. The Soviet government also hopes to find ways to eliminate existing discrimination, establish good relations between the US and the Soviet Union, and strengthen global peace. Ambassador Smith has agreed to forward Molotov's letter to the US government.

### News Reaches Paris: US Dollar Plummets

[United Press Paris, 11th] News of the US-Soviet talks has caused the US dollar to plummet. On the 10th, one dollar was equivalent to 348 francs, but on the 11th, it was 335 francs.

### Smith Returns to the US via France: Deeply Surprised by Soviet Leak of Secrets

[Our Newspaper] London, 11th Radio: Berlin News, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, traveled to France, passing through here. He was deeply surprised by the Soviet Union's sudden public announcement of the content of his discussions with Molotov, because both parties had previously agreed to keep it secret.

[Reuters Berlin, 11th] US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, passed through here today on his way back to the US and said that the Soviet Union's publication of the content of his conversation with Molotov was a breach of confidentiality, because he believed that his contact with Molotov was completely confidential. He also said that he knew nothing about the part of the Soviet announcement regarding the Soviet Union's agreement to discuss with the US. Regarding his trip back to the US, Smith said that he was returning to the US for a vacation and fishing trip for ten days.

### US Under Secretary of the Army Draper Advocates Revival of Japanese Textile Industry: Can Enable Japan to Become Economically Self-Sufficient

[United Press Washington, 10th] Under Secretary of the Army Draper, who recently inspected Japan and returned, presented his views to the House Military Subcommittee today, advocating the use of American cotton and wool to revive the Japanese textile industry. It is said that this plan is sufficient to reduce occupation costs and enable Japan to become economically self-sufficient. The rehabilitation plan applies to all occupied areas, but Japan benefits the most. The Department of the Army currently hopes that the Japanese textile industry will restore a quarter of its pre-war production capacity by the end of 1949, that is, even if three million spindles are put into operation.

[Central News Agency Tokyo, 11th] It is reported that the Japanese Economic Stabilization Board has increased the planned production volume of rayon in the first quarter of this fiscal year from the original 8.4 million pounds to 9.5 million pounds.

### Soviet People Excited, London Expresses Gratification

[Our Newspaper] New York, 11th Radio: Moscow News, The Soviet people seem to have responded well to the US proposal to improve US-Soviet relations. The Moscow radio station broadcast this news at least twice. Major newspapers such as Pravda, Izvestia, and Labor Daily all revealed the battle in prominent positions, occupying a lot of space. US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith went to Qia today. When he went to the airport, the embassy staff did not know about this matter, but they already knew about the recent meeting between Smith and Molotov. The first person in the embassy to learn about this news was Smith himself. He heard it from the broadcast of the All India Radio Station. However, American observers cannot express optimism about the Soviet response, because the Soviet note strongly stated that the Soviet Union will continue its policy of consolidating relations with Eastern European countries, just as the United States is consolidating its relations with neighboring countries.

[Reuters London, 11th] After the news of the US and the Soviet Union agreeing to discuss resolving the differences between the two countries was announced, people in London felt happy. People here pointed out that when Marshall testified to the House Foreign Affairs Committee last Wednesday, he had already revealed the US's willingness to obtain understanding with the Soviet Union. Marshall also believed that the current Soviet foreign policy was due to misunderstandings about the motives of Western countries. What Marshall wants now is to find a way to adjust this misunderstanding. Political figures here also believe that Marshall's contact with the Soviet Union was launched because they saw that the crisis in Berlin was becoming increasingly serious and would lead to a war-like situation. However, people in London do not underestimate the major difficulties in the US and the Soviet Union's interests tending to harmony. It is remembered that former Secretary of State Byrnes also tried to revive this institution after the first breakdown of the Foreign Ministers Conference in the autumn of 1945. Although the Foreign Ministers Conference was revived later, it only lasted for two years before ending in a breakdown.

### South Korean Election Extremely Smooth: 90% of Voters Have Voted, North Korean Troops Invade South Korea Twice

[Central News Agency Seoul, 10th, United Press] Syrian representative of the United Nations delegation to Korea, Mo Hee, said that the South Korean election on the 10th has been successful. Mr. Mo Hee has inspected various constituencies in Seoul. He said: The election is proceeding smoothly and the organization is very good.

[Reuters Seoul, 10th] A total of 25 people died in South Korea on the 10th day of the general election due to acts of violence and conflicts. Sixty-six people died and 30 were injured in the conflicts before the election. However, according to informal reports, by the time the polling stations closed on the night of the 10th, 85% to 90% of the 7 million voters in South Korea had voted.

[Reuters Seoul, 11th] Among the first ten elected members of South Korea, there are five candidates from the center-right Democratic Party. Although Lee Seung-man himself was elected in the Seoul district without an opponent, his subordinates did not receive widespread support as generally expected. Reports from remote areas of South Korea show that the riots during the election have subsided, but late reports show that the death toll continues to increase compared to yesterday's reports. Several ballot boxes on Yeouido were destroyed before they were opened. Seoul police authorities confirmed that North Korean troops had crossed the 38th parallel into South Korea twice yesterday and exchanged fire with South Korean police. Both times were near Kaesong. Pyongyang Radio today once again threatened to cut off the electricity supply from North Korea to South Korea, claiming that if the South Korean representatives do not go to North Korea to negotiate the electricity bill before May 10, the electricity supply will be cut off.

### US Will Provide 60 Million Yuan to Help Korea Rebuild

[United Press Washington, 10th] US officials said on the 10th that the United States is currently carrying out a plan to provide approximately 60 million US dollars to help Korea's economic recovery in the fiscal year starting on July 1, regardless of whether US troops will still be stationed in the country during this entire period. If South Korea is controlled by the communists, the US will cancel the economic aid.

### US Railroad Workers Decide to Cancel Strike

All National Trains Operate Normally

[Reuters Washington, 11th] The US Railroad Workers Union has revoked the order instructing 190,000 railroad workers to launch a strike at 10:00 am on Tuesday, following an order from the Federal Court.

[United Press Washington, 11th] National railroad trains are operating normally today, and no workers are on strike.

[United Press Washington, 10th] President Truman issued an order on the 10th to take over the US railroads and asked railroad workers not to leave their posts and to cooperate with the government.

### Siam Orders Closure of 30 Overseas Chinese Schools

Because they are still hanging the Chinese flag

[Reuters Bangkok, 10th] The Siamese Ministry of Education has ordered 30 overseas Chinese schools to close, citing violations of the rules on hanging national flags. According to the regulations of the Siamese Ministry of Education, all schools should hang the Siamese flag, but some Chinese schools are unwilling to hang the Siamese flag and still hang the Chinese flag, so they are punished.

### Nicola Sforza Abandons Election: Italian Presidential Election Stillborn, Einaudi's Election Seems to Be a Foregone Conclusion

[Reuters Rome, 11th] When the Italian Senate and House of Representatives resumed the presidential election on the 11th, both of the most advantageous candidates in yesterday's election, interim President Nicola and Foreign Minister Sforza, had declared their withdrawal from the election. In yesterday's second vote, Sforza received 405 votes and Nicola received 336 votes. After the Social Unity Party, which occupies 7% of the seats in the parliament, declared that it did not intend to support Sforza, Sforza announced his withdrawal from the election, and the Christian Democratic Party decided to order its members to support Budget Minister Einaudi, who has made great contributions to stabilizing Italy's finances after the war, as president. As for Nicola, he withdrew from the election on the grounds of poor health.

[United Press Rome, 11th] The Italian parliament held a third vote today to elect a president, but the results of the ballot still failed to determine the overall situation. As soon as the joint session of the Senate and the House of Representatives began, 140 members of the Communist Party, the left-wing Socialist Party, the Transcendental faction, and small groups withdrew from the meeting, resulting in the result of the vote not reaching the required two-thirds majority, which is 600 votes. The right-wing Socialist Party and the Republican Party both cast blank ballots, indicating that the left is not bound by the fundamentalist Democratic Party and Prime Minister Gasperi. Einaudi's election as President of Italy seems to be a foregone conclusion, as all parties have agreed to support him in the fourth vote.

### Special Relief Donation Fundraising Committee Meeting: Decides to Invite Trade Associations and Clan Associations to Launch Free Donations from All Walks of Life, Considers It Unfair to Increase the Donation Amount in the Shanghai Area Alone

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Special Relief Donation Fundraising Committee held its fourth meeting at the city government conference room at 3:00 pm yesterday. Chairman Wu Guozhen, Vice Chairman Du Yuesheng, Committee members Xu Jiyu, Qian Yongming, Wang Yiting, Fang Zhi, Wu Kaixian, Wu Yuncong, Wang Xianqing, Qin Runqing, Zhang Qiang of the Hangzhou sub-district (representing Xu Jiyu), Yan Xinqi of the Suzhou sub-district (representing Yan Xuehui), and Li Tiping of the Wuxi sub-district (representing Tang Min) attended. Central Supervisory Committee member Jiang Tang also attended and participated. The meeting decided that at 3:00 pm on May 26, all committee members will invite the chairmen of various trade associations and the presidents of various clan associations to hold a meeting to launch free donations from all walks of life, with the deadline being the end of June. The total amount of special donations in the Shanghai area was originally 5.5 trillion, but the Executive Yuan's Special Promotion Supervisory Committee decided to increase it by 3 trillion, for a total of 8.5 trillion. Yesterday's meeting discussed this matter by various committee members, believing that it is unfair to only increase the amount in the Shanghai area. They requested that Committee member Jiang Yong go to Beijing to present his views to the central government, stating that if an increase is necessary, it should be a universal increase in all areas across the country.

### List of Targets: Temporarily Kept Secret, Names Will Be Announced Again if Donations Are Overdue

According to Chairman Wu's statement to reporters, the city government has prepared a list of special donation targets, with thousands of people listed. However, the list will not be announced for the time being. Free donations will be launched first, with the deadline being the end of June. If donations are overdue, the names of the provinces listed will be announced again, awaiting public opinion sanctions. The more special donations raised, the better. 8.5 trillion or 5.5 trillion are only used as targets and not as limits.

In addition, the promotion of special donations has been decided to focus on relieving refugees and doing good deeds to encourage them. The third meeting had resolved to use a portion of the special donations raised for the purpose of relieving refugees in the city so that local people can actively participate in inspections. The Supervisory Committee has now telegraphed that the principle is feasible and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. In addition, the third meeting decided that people related to politics on the list of special donation targets will not be nominated locally. The central government telegraphed on this point that local nominations can be made to open the list and secretly submit it to the central government for approval.

### Mayor Summoned Rice Market Management Committee: Hopes to Effectively Suppress Sales Prices, Civil Food Allocation Committee is Ready to Sell at Any Time

[Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu summoned Xu Songren, the management committee of the north and south rice markets, at 9:00 am yesterday to verify the prices of San, Yin Fuxiang, Hu Wen'an, and others. The mayor stated that the stability of rice prices in the city for the past two months was the result of cooperation between rice merchants and the government. However, in the past ten days, rice prices have soared by more than 1 million, 45 percent higher than before, which is unreasonable. Food rice cannot be compared to gold coins, so I hope that the market management committee and rice merchants will assist the government in suppressing the rising trend. The rice merchants said that market price fluctuations are affected by the place of production and hope to dredge up the source and ask the central government to suppress prices in the place of production so that the city can be stabilized. In addition to hoping that rice merchants will cooperate with the government, the mayor also stated that if the rising trend does not stop, the Civil Food Allocation Committee is ready to sell at any time.

### National Bank Allocates 5,000 Tons of Sugar: Bidding and Allocation Will Be Handled Today

In view of the recent surge in sugar prices, the National Bank has allocated 5,000 tons of special grade granulated white sugar under the heading of material procurement in order to suppress the rising trend, and entrusted the Taiwan Sugar Corporation to use the bidding method to allocate it (but the company's usual routine sugar allocation will not be stopped). All customers who have been approved for registration by the company can participate in bidding and apply for allocation from 9:00 am to 11:00 am today.

### Big Pancakes and Fried Dough Sticks Cost 10,000 Yuan Each: Boiled Water Will Also Increase in Price

The May price surge is coming on strong. Amid the general rise in prices, big pancakes, fried dough sticks, and boiled water are also starting to increase in price. It is reported that big pancakes and fried dough sticks, which originally cost 5,000 yuan each, are now selling for 10,000 yuan; boiled water from the boiler, which originally cost 3,000 yuan per bucket, will now increase to 5,000 yuan.

### Informant in Gold and Currency Case: Still Given a Percentage as a Reward

[Our Newspaper] Regarding whether to continue to pay rewards for cracking down on black market gold and currency cases, the person in charge of the Gold Control Bureau stated: These rewards are still being paid. According to Article 5 of the Regulations on Penalties for Buying and Selling Gold and Foreign Currency, which was amended and promulgated by the Legislative Yuan on December 9 last year, all confiscated items should be turned over to the national treasury. Therefore, since the publication of these regulations, gold and currency confiscated for illegal buying and selling cannot be given a percentage as a reward according to law. However, the Ministry of Finance believes that the above regulations may lose the meaning of rewards and has specifically requested the Executive Yuan to allow the confiscated gold and currency and fines to be handled in accordance with the original methods of the Ministry of Finance. The case is being consulted by the Executive Yuan to the Legislative Yuan for amendment and approval. Before it is announced, all gold and currency confiscated for illegal buying and selling are allowed to continue to be converted and rewarded in order to avoid affecting the rewarding of informants.

### Fare Increase on Both Lines is Inevitable: Application to Increase by 50%

[Our Newspaper] Responsible persons from various departments of the Jinghu District Railway Administration have held meetings for several days, which is said to be discussing the issue of price increases. Since the strike occurred due to the rice subsidy dispute, after the Bureau accepted the employees' demands, the Bureau's income and expenditure have been unable to balance. Moreover, in the May price surge, railway essential materials such as fuel and hardware have increased significantly. Therefore, fare increases on both lines for passengers and freight are inevitable, and are now only awaiting the approval of the Ministry of Transportation. It is reported that the percentage of the adjustment applied to the Ministry of Transportation by the Bureau is 50%.

### Deronghua and Other 23 Commercial Firms Sent to Court for Investigation for Disrupting Finances

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Financial Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Finance yesterday sent a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office, which stated: "Chengxinhang, Xiechenghao, and other six firms are suspected of disrupting finances. The Water Bureau has already sent a letter to your office on March 23 requesting that you handle the matter in accordance with the law. Now, we have received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance stating that Deronghua, Hongda Hang, Yushenghe, Sun Guangxing Watch Company, Fuhua Shenzhuang, Xietai Hang, Global Import and Export Company, He Yulun, Heshenghao, Dachangxing, Jiafu Spice Company, Damao Textile Company, Junyiyuan, Yiyongchang, Yongfengguang, Zhongxing, Tongyuan Industrial Raw Material Firm, Furi Huahang, Liu Caixing, Yongxin Chemical Company, Youda Hang, Jutetai, and Zhonghua International Company, a total of 23 firms related to this case, have been found to have privately converted foreign exchange, bought and sold gold and foreign currency, or used gold and foreign currency instead of currency for transactions and payments, or have major suspicions. They should be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations on Foreign Exchange Control and the amended Regulations on Penalties for Buying and Selling Gold and Foreign Currency. The account books of Deronghua and other firms have been retrieved by our bureau and returned to the Shanghai Police Bureau, which has already sent a letter to the bureau requesting that it investigate and transfer the case to your office for investigation in accordance with the law." Prosecutor Chen Shoutao of the District Prosecutor's Office is handling the case and will begin the investigation after the evidence is sent by the police bureau.

### Restrictions on Flour Transactions to Balance Supply and Prevent Speculation

### Overseas Chinese Delegates to National Assembly Return to Shanghai to Speak; Government Must Gain People's Trust; Policy Changes Are Inevitable

[Report from Our Newspaper] An overseas Chinese delegate to the National Assembly who has returned to Shanghai told our reporter yesterday that with the imminent establishment of a constitutional government, prices are soaring, and money and food are rising sharply, but the government is doing nothing, losing the people's trust. Exports have long been suspended, overseas remittances have disappeared, and recently, the method of daily exchange settlement for imports has been changed, which is driving the import trade to the brink of extinction. Coupled with high-interest policies, this is fueling further price increases, which will inevitably lead to the impoverishment of the people.

We hope that the government will immediately change course and give people a fresh start, so that the country can be stabilized, built, and succeed.

### The National Games Athletics Program Successfully Concludes; Taiwan and Qingdao Secure Men's and Women's Championships Respectively; Lou Wen'ao's 10,000-Meter Time, Though Good, Falls Short of Ideal; Swimming Competition Begins Today; Key Battles in Soccer and Basketball

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the rain cleared, various competitions of the National Games continued yesterday. On the final day of athletics, all events concluded successfully. Taiwan and Qingdao won the men's and women's championships, respectively. In men's athletics, Taiwan scored 155 points to win the championship, followed by the Air Force with 69 points, Shanghai with 61 points, the Navy with 45 points, and Malaya with 26 points. In women's athletics, Qingdao saw a surge in points yesterday, securing the championship with 47 points, followed by Hebei with 37 points, Guangdong in third place with 33 points, Taiwan in fourth, Fujian in fifth, and Beiping in sixth. New records continued to emerge yesterday. Lou Wen'ao, the center of attention, won the 10,000-meter race in 32 minutes and 47 seconds, breaking the national record, but unfortunately, it did not reach his ideal time, being a minute slower than his performance in the United States. Huang and Liang Zheng from Malaya broke the national record in the intermediate hurdles with 57.9 seconds, the most outstanding performance of the day. Over the past four days, a total of five new national records were set in men's events: 400 meters, 5,000 meters, 10,000 meters, intermediate hurdles, and discus; and three in women's events: hurdles (preliminary), shot put, and high jump. New meet records were set in three men's events: 1,500 meters, high hurdles, and shot put; and one women's event: 100 meters. The gains are abundant, and should be considered satisfactory.

Following athletics, the swimming competition begins today, promising a grand spectacle. Today's soccer and basketball championship round-robin tournaments feature key battles, with Shanghai facing the Army in soccer, and the Police facing Hong Kong. The athletics field will again be crowded with spectators. The men's and women's basketball championship round-robin tournaments already began yesterday and will continue today.

### 80,000 Spectators Watch the 10,000-Meter Showdown; "Silent General" Lou Wen'ao Leads All the Way; Breaks National Record with 32 Minutes and 47 Seconds

â€” Our Reporter Zhang Shengzhi

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The 10,000-meter final was the highlight of the athletics competition. Approximately 80,000 spectators, drawn by the name of the "Silent General" Lou Wen'ao, watched from the sidelines.

In the end, Lou Wen'ao broke Sun Che's national record of 34 minutes and 1.1 seconds with a time of 32 minutes and 47 seconds, but this was still far from his personal best of 31 minutes and 27.8 seconds.

Lou Wen'ao had previously tried wearing spiked shoes in the 5,000-meter race but felt uncomfortable. Therefore, yesterday he reverted to wearing rubber-soled running shoes, but this still did not produce a satisfactory result. Since returning from the United States, Lou Wen'ao has seemed to be in poor form.

An analysis of the reasons for Lou Wen'ao's relatively poor performance yesterday: the deliberate obstruction by several runners halfway through the race was the biggest factor. This disrupted the consistent pace of his "long-distance machine," causing fluctuations in speed. To avoid this intentional obstruction, Lou had to accelerate and run around the outside lane, resulting in a "case of doing more work for less result," wasting much energy and losing more than 30 seconds.

### The Record Was Not as Ideal; The First Half Was Satisfactory

According to the advice of American athletics coaches: to shorten Lou Wen'ao's time, the first and most basic step is to switch to spiked shoes. Therefore, until Lou Wen'ao becomes accustomed to wearing spiked shoes, it is virtually impossible for him to break the 31-minute barrier in the 10,000 meters.

Analyzing the timing: for Lou Wen'ao to enter the 31-minute range, the average time for each lap (500 meters) must not exceed 1 minute and 33 seconds. However, yesterday his average time was 1 minute and 35.35 seconds. Except for the first three laps and the last lap, which were of a reasonable standard, most of the other sixteen laps exceeded 1 minute and 40 seconds.

Comparatively speaking: Lou Wen'ao's time at the 5,000-meter mark was 15 minutes and 59 seconds, a slight improvement over his official 5,000-meter race time of 16 minutes and 4/5 seconds. However, for the sake of setting a new record, this result was not satisfactory. At least the time for the first half of the race should have been within 15 minutes and 30 seconds for an ideal record.

Another reason: Lou Wen'ao is accustomed to running on a 400-meter track, so he inevitably lost some accuracy and control in calculating the distance and time on a 500-meter track. All of these factors contributed to his decline in performance.

However, setting aside the record, Lou Wen'ao's relaxed and springy stride throughout the entire race, always leading and dominating the field, was still an exciting spectacle.

He left the second-place finisher, Qingdao's Liu Jingli, about 450 meters behind, and was even 600 meters ahead of the third-place finisher, Lao Yu, giving the more than 80,000 spectators a great show.

The fourth-place finisher was Yu Shengquan from Hebei Province, who finished about 30 seconds behind Lao Yu. Chen Wansheng from Taiwan finished fifth, and An Benquan from the Joint Logistics Command managed to secure sixth place after a hard fight.

### Tense Moments in Every Lap of the Entire Race

There were 36 runners at the start of the 10,000-meter race. The race unfolded as follows:

At the sound of the gun, Lou Wen'ao surged ahead of the pack at high speed. After 750 meters, the long line of runners resembled a string of ribbonfish in motion. Lou took large strides at the front, followed by Liu Jingli, Yu Qing, An Benquan, Gan Xiwei, Yu Shengquan, and Chen Wansheng.

Two and a half laps (1,250 meters): Lou Wen'ao pulled 30 meters ahead of the main group. Liu Jingli, Ping Xiwei, and Chen Wansheng followed closely behind, with An Benquan and Yu Shengquan slightly further back.

Three and a half laps (1,750 meters): Lou Wen'ao led by 50 meters. Yu Xiwei overtook Liu Jingxian, while Chen Wansheng remained in fourth place. Yu Shengquan began to pass An Benquan.

Four and a half laps (2,250 meters): Lou Wen'ao was about to catch up with the last few runners, and the stands erupted in applause. At that time, Yu Xiwei, Liu Jingkun, and Chen Wansheng were locked in a tight battle. By the end of the fifth lap, Lou Wen'ao had overtaken the last three runners.

Five and a half laps (2,750 meters): Lou Wen'ao pulled 120 meters ahead of the second-place runner. The other positions remained largely unchanged.

Six and a half laps (3,250 meters): Lou Wen'ao extended his lead by another 40 meters. Yu Xiwei and Liu Jingkun were fiercely competing for second place. At that point, it seemed like Lou Wen'ao was putting on a performance, while Yu and Liu were actually racing!

Seven and a half laps (3,750 meters): Lou Wen'ao was now 200 meters ahead of the second-place runner. Liu Jingkun began to overtake Gan Xiwei. The other positions remained largely unchanged.

Eight and a half laps (4,250 meters): Yu Xiwei regained second place, temporarily overtaking Liu Jingkun. Lou Wen'ao continued to pull away, now 230 meters ahead of them.

Nine and a half laps (4,750 meters): Everything remained the same, with little change.

Ten and a half laps (5,250 meters): Lou Wen'ao was almost a full lap ahead of the main group.

Eleven and a half laps (5,750 meters): The battle for second place intensified. Liu Jingkun once again overtook Yu Xiwei, extending his lead to five meters. Chen Wansheng and Yu Shengquan remained in fourth and fifth place, respectively. An Benquan remained in sixth place. At this point, the overall situation seemed to be settled.

Twelve and a half laps (6,150 meters): The situation was similar to the previous lap.

Thirteen and a half laps (6,750 meters): Lou Wen'ao's pace remained largely unchanged. Yu Xiwei gradually lost the courage to compete for second place and fell 20 meters behind. Finally, Lou Wen'ao began to catch up with Yu Shengguo, who was then in fifth place.

Fourteen and a half laps (7,250 meters): No change.

Fifteen and a half laps (7,750 meters): Lou Wen'ao further caught up with Chen Wansheng, who was then in fourth place.

Sixteen and a half laps (8,250 meters): The top three positions were largely settled. Chen Wansheng, the Taiwanese athlete who was originally in fourth place, gradually slowed down. In contrast, Yu Shengquan from Hebei had plenty of stamina left and was gaining momentum.

Seventeen and a half laps (8,750 meters): Chen Wansheng began to fall behind. Yu Shengquan took fourth place.

Eighteen and a half laps (9,250 meters): The overall situation remained largely unchanged.

### Strengthening Speed in the Final Lap

Starting the final lap: Lou Wen'ao increased his speed. At this time, Liu Jingli was about 400 meters behind. With 250 meters to go, Sou Wen'ao overtook Yu Xiwei, who was in third place, and sprinted towards the finish line, winning the championship amidst applause and cheers.

Lou Wen'ao's lap times for the 10,000 meters are listed below:

### Huang and Liang Zheng Break National Record in 400-Meter Intermediate Hurdles; Qingdao Team Wins Women's Athletics Championship; Yu Xiwei Wins 800-Meter Championship

200-Meter Final In the men's 200-meter final, it was widely believed to be a battle between Shanghai and Taiwan. There were four athletes from Taiwan, two from Shanghai, one from Malaya, and one from Qingdao. Shanghai's Rong Chengbiao had a strong finish and was capable of competing with the Taiwanese athletes. However, in the end, the top three places were all taken by Taiwan. Rong Chengbiao managed to finish fourth, and Taiwan took fifth place. Malaya finished sixth. Xu Tong took the lead at the start. Rong Chengbiao and the other three Taiwanese athletes were in a line at the 100-meter mark, but in the last 20 meters, Rong Chengbiao lacked the stamina to maintain his position and fell back to fourth place. Xu Tong finished first, followed by Xu Tiande and Chen Yinglang in second and third place, respectively. The time of 23.4 seconds was only average. It was later said that Rong Chengbiao's running shoes were damaged, and he borrowed Wu Zhonghai's shoes, which were too big for him to run effectively. It is difficult to win when athletes are not prepared beforehand.

400-Meter Intermediate Hurdles The intermediate hurdles final was another masterpiece by Malaya's Huang and Liang Zheng, following his high hurdles final. It was also one of the more exciting events of yesterday's athletics competition, even more so than the 10,000-meter race. Huang and Liang Zheng broke Cheng Jinguan's national record of 58.3 seconds with a time of 57.9 seconds. He was almost a hurdle ahead of the second-place finisher, Lu Zuofu from Tianjin. Huang and Liang Zheng's start was strong, his strides were wide and accurate, and his hurdling seemed rhythmic. He reached the finish line, but it was a pity that photographers were taking pictures, otherwise his performance might have been even better. Zhang Zhiqing from the Navy finished third, followed by Lai Youde from Taiwan, Ma Guoquan from Chongqing, and Rui Shizhen from the Army.

1,600-Meter Relay The 1,600-meter relay final was another victory for the Taiwanese athletes. The four Taiwanese runners led all the way, finishing well ahead of the second-place Shanghai team by about 30 meters. The competition between the Shanghai team and the Beiping team was fierce, with only a small difference between them. The team lists are as follows:

Fourth Runner Chen Yinglang Rong Chengbiao Ren Yao

Women's 60-Meter Final In the women's 60-meter final, Wang Shugui from Qingdao won first place again after her victory in the 100 meters, sweeping the women's sprint titles. Yu Renjia from Nanjing had the fastest start and finished second. Wang Shugui only began to surge after 50 meters, accelerating to the finish line. Li Xinyi from Chongqing was only a shoulder-width behind Yu Renjia, making it difficult to distinguish between them. The fourth, fifth, and sixth places, Li Xiaobi, Guo Meili, and Zou Kaichun, were also only a step apart. The time of 8.3 seconds was good. Because the 60 meters is a new event, there are no records to compare it with.

Women's 200-Meter Final In the women's 200-meter final, Wang Shugui's strength was insufficient, and she was defeated by Chen Biying from Fujian, finishing second. Chen Biying's endurance was superior, and her speed increased greatly after 100 meters. Wang Shugui's body and legs were thicker, making her less suited for longer distances. She finished about a meter behind Chen Biying. Li Xinyi was small and finished fourth. Jiang Kangri, the daughter of Jiang Guangding, finished third. The two Guangdong athletes, Li Xiaojiong and Mei Shunyan, were too petite and finished fifth and sixth. Lin Baijiao from Taiwan and Feng Ziqin from Hankou failed to qualify.

Women's 400-Meter Relay The women's 400-meter relay final was the key to Qingdao's victory, adding 14 points to their total and securing the women's athletics championship with 47 points. At the start, Zhao Hong from Hebei took the lead. Mei Shunyan from Guangdong and Wang Jirong from Qingdao followed behind. In the third leg, Jiang Kangri from Guangdong overtook Zhang Qi from the Hebei team, while Shu Shulong from the Qingdao team was running neck and neck with the Guangdong team. In the fourth leg, Wang Shugui used her fastest speed to win first place. Li Xiaofeng from Guangdong finished second, very close behind. Wang Leyi from Hebei finished third. The Taiwanese athletes were not skilled in baton passing and finished fourth.

Men's 800-Meter Final Veteran Yu Xiwei won the championship in 2 minutes and 6.4 seconds, winning very easily. Li Helong from Liaoning was also quite strong and had a fierce competition with Yu, but in the last 50 meters, his sprint skills were lacking, and Yu pulled ahead by three meters. It was a case of superior skill. The strength of the four runners behind them was very even, and they finished very close together. Ni Si from the Army finished third, followed by Che Keying from the Joint Logistics Command, Song Wenjian from Qingdao, and Ma Liancheng from Hebei.

### Zhang Ruiyan Throws with Her Fair Arm; Women's Javelin Throw Result is 27.84 Meters; Chen Lilang Light as a Swallow; Pole Vault Record is 3.52 Meters; Review of Two Field Events

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday's field events consisted of the women's javelin throw and the men's pole vault finals. Both events were only average in terms of results. The pole vault was a very intense competition. The events began at 2:30 PM and lasted until 6:00 PM. A brief overview of the two events is as follows:

Women's Javelin Throw, 29 registered athletes, but only 17 actually participated. In the three preliminary throws, only six athletes exceeded 23 meters. During her three throws, Zhang Ruiyan from Taiwan ran and charged, throwing with her fair arm, achieving 27.84 meters. Xiao Sun threw three more times, achieving a maximum score of 27.52 meters, which angered her greatly. The rankings and results are as follows:

(1) Zhang Ruiyan (Taiwan) 27.84 meters

(2) Sun Suxia (Qingdao) 27.52 meters

(3) Zhou Zufin (Shanghai) 24.97 meters

(4) Yin Yunyin (Hebei) 24.61 meters

(5) Song Jinhuan (Fujian) 23.68 meters

(6) Hu Cuihua (Beijing) 23.01 meters

Men's Pole Vault, starting at 2:30 PM, with 28 athletes registering. The competition was slow, starting at 2.80 meters. By 4:30 PM, the bar was only raised to 3.20 meters. Ten athletes still managed to clear it. At 5:00 PM, the bar was raised to 3.30 meters. Only Huang Jian from the Air Force and Zhang Lilang from Taiwan cleared it on their first attempt. The other athletes failed to clear it after three attempts. When the height was raised to 3.40 meters, Huang Jian cleared it with ease on his first attempt. Lilang failed on his first attempt but cleared it on his second attempt. At 3.46 meters, Huang Jian sprinted from a distance with the pole, eliciting cheers from the audience. His posture in the air was truly ethereal. At this point, Lilang's leg muscles began to weaken, but he did not lose heart and managed to clear the bar again. When the bar was raised to 3.52 meters, Huang Jian was too careless on his first attempt. His body cleared the bar, but his hand knocked the bar down. At this moment, Lilang suddenly seemed to receive an injection of adrenaline. He ran calmly with the pole, performed a clean and crisp somersault, and cleared the bar, reversing his previous sluggish form. This jump shocked Huang, causing him to become disoriented. On his second attempt, his legs became entangled with the pole, and he fell to the ground before clearing the bar, injuring his leg. After trying to run twice, he was unable to jump again and had to reluctantly give up the championship he had not yet won. With only Lilang left to jump, he was ambitious and raised the bar to 3.60 meters. However, he was exhausted and failed on two attempts, automatically giving up on his third attempt. As a result, the highest score was only 3.52 meters. The three-and-a-half-hour-long battle resulted in a score that was still a foot and a half short of Fu Wang's (Bao Lu's) old record. The rankings and scores are listed below:

(1) Zhang Lilang (Taiwan) 3.52 meters

(2) Huang Jian (Air Force) 3.46 meters

(3) Yu Tiejun (Guangdong) 3.20 meters

(4) Chen Shuhuang (Guangdong) 3.20 meters

(5) Chen Liang (Police) 3.20 meters

(6) Lu Tiezhong (Army) 3.20 meters

### Gunshots on the Athletics Field Gunshots on the Athletics Field Police Officer Accidentally Injures Partner

[Report from Our Newspaper] At 10:25 AM yesterday, before the start of the competition, when there were few spectators in the athletics field, a gunshot suddenly rang out in the north stands, causing a spectator to fall to the ground. After investigation by reporters, it was revealed that Zhang Wenlong, a police officer from the Sixth Squadron of the Security Police, had given his pistol to his colleague, Yang Hua. However, the gun was loaded with ten bullets, and it was accidentally triggered, causing a bullet to enter Yang's left calf. Bleeding profusely, he collapsed to the ground. An ambulance arrived and took the injured officer to the police hospital for treatment.

### Soccer Round-Robin Tournament Begins Today Shanghai vs. Army; Police vs. Hong Kong; Key Battles for Championship Will Inevitably Be Fierce

[Report from Our Newspaper] The highly anticipated soccer championship round-robin tournament officially begins today. At 2:00 PM, Shanghai will face the Army, and at 4:00 PM, the Police will face Hong Kong. Both matches will be held at the main athletics field. According to the single round-robin system, each of the four teams will only have three opportunities to compete. Each win earns two points, a draw earns one point for each team, and a loss earns no points. Therefore, today's matches between the four teams will directly affect the contenders for the championship. In other words, if the Police lose to Hong Kong, or the Army lose to Shanghai, any team that loses once will have significantly reduced hopes of winning the championship. Therefore, it is expected that all four teams will give their all to compete at that time. The possible lineups for each team today are as follows:

Police Team:

Yu Yaode, Zeng Zhongyun, Zheng Yingquan, Mo Jinsong, Liu Tianshen, You Huaxing, Liu Qingcai, Tan Zhenhui, Tan Huanzhang, Zhao Fu, Li Bingzhao, Xie Jinhe

Hong Kong Team:

Tan Junqian, Li Guowei, Lu Hanchen, Feng Kunsheng, Kong Qingyu, Deng Sen, Li Shuoyou, Deng Yijie, Li Deqi, Li Chunfa, Qian Canguang

### Tonight's Two Men's Basketball Games Moved to the Venue

The women's team basketball championship round-robin match between Shanghai and Indonesia, and the men's team match between Shanghai and the Combined Services, originally scheduled to be held at the City Gymnasium on Shaanxi South Road starting at 7:00 PM on the 11th, have now been decided by the registered venue groups to be moved to the Grand Venue Gymnasium for competition, with the time still starting at 7:00 PM.

### Today's Men's Basketball Round-Robin Schedule: Shanghai and Philippine Nationals Face Police and Combined Services Separately; Shanghai Should Be Calm, Combined Services Should Not Be Too Nervous

[Our Report] There are two men's basketball round-robin matches today: (1) Shanghai vs. Police, (2) Combined Services vs. Philippine Nationals. The Shanghai team has many talented players, and this reporter believes that it is not advisable to fight with only these five players as in the game on the 11th. When stamina is lacking, fresh troops should be brought on stage. If the game is played in the same way as on the 11th, it may not be easy to win. Having learned from the Philippine Nationals, the Police should deal with the game against Shanghai with more composure.

The Combined Services excels in electric warfare tactics, strong cutting, and bold shooting; while the Philippine Nationals are good at using feints to lure the enemy and break in to score. A fierce battle is inevitable when the two teams meet. However, if the Combined Services can improve their shooting accuracy, they may be able to win. If they are too nervous, they may be defeated by the Philippine Nationals.

The 13th should be the final battle for the championship, Shanghai vs. the Philippine Nationals. This reporter believes that the key to victory lies in Shanghai's spirit of cooperation. The sum of the individual skills of the Shanghai team is better than that of the Philippine Nationals, but unfortunately, due to the lack of ideal cooperation, a lot of effort is wasted. The Philippine Nationals have staying power, and if Shanghai is exhausted, it could create an opportunity for the Philippine Nationals to benefit. (Yusheng)

### First Act of the Women's Basketball Round-Robin Tournament: Fujian Reverses the Situation, Shanghai Sharply Defeats Indonesia

[Our Report] There were two women's basketball round-robin matches yesterday. As a result, the Philippines first prospered and then declined, performing abnormally in the last few minutes, losing to Fujian with a score of 21-28. Indonesia also lost to the sharp offensive of the Shanghai team with a score of 32-41, due to being unfamiliar with indoor combat. The details of the battles are as follows:

Philippine Nationals First Prosper and Then Decline

The game between Fujian and the Philippine Nationals began at 2:00 PM. One minute into the game, Fujian's Huang Guiying committed a foul, and the Philippine National's Yang Xiuzhi missed the free throw. Huang Rulan intercepted the ball and made a brave shot, giving the Philippine Nationals a 2-0 lead. After a while, Philippine Cai Shuqiong committed a foul, and Fujian's Huang Guiying missed the free throw. Philippine National's Chen Yujian scored two points, and Fujian's Chen Jucai returned the favor, and Xu Xinxi also scored two points. Then, Fujian's Lin Xuee committed an invading foul, and Chen [illegible] missed the free throw. Fujian's Huang Rulan committed a foul, and Philippine National's Yang Xiuzhi made the free throw. Fujian's Xu Xinxi scored a point, and Philippine National's Chen Yujian returned two points, making it 9-8, with the Philippine Nationals taking the lead. Philippine National's Xue Shuqiong committed a foul, and the time for the first quarter was up, and the referee announced that the free throw would be made up in the second quarter.

The battle restarted, and Fujian's Chen Jucai made the free throw, tying the score at 9-9. Philippine National's Liu Peizhen fouled again, and Fujian's Xu Xinxi scored one point from the free throw. The audience was worried about the Philippine Nationals, cheering them on. Philippine National's Chen Yurun responded with a shot, and Huang Rulan added another point, and the Philippine Nationals regained the lead. Since then, both sides scored with free throws, and at the end of the first half, the score was 16-11, with the Philippine Nationals taking the lead.

The second half began, and Fujian began to counterattack, making it 19-16, with the Philippine Nationals still in the lead in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Fujian's Xu Xinxi jumped under the basket and shot the ball into the net. Philippine National's Chen Yurun responded with two points. However, Ye Yijing and Chen Yurun committed consecutive fouls, and Xu Xinxi made all three free throws, tying the score at 21-21. The audience cheered for both sides for three minutes. At this time, the Philippine Nationals became nervous, and their shots missed, while Fujian made one of three free throws, and then reversed the situation with a score of 28-21, and Fujian turned defeat into victory. In this game, the Philippine Nationals were in the lead for all three quarters, and the audience expected them to win. The loss in the last quarter was probably due to underestimating the opponent.

Indonesia's Recovery Fails

In the Shanghai vs. Indonesia match, Shanghai's offensive line was extremely sharp, and Shi Zongmin and Huang Mingyuan broke into the basket as if entering an uninhabited area, calmly shooting and scoring repeatedly. Indonesia seemed unaccustomed to floor combat, and three players even entered the arena barefoot. What Indonesia relied on was originally agile movements and accurate shooting. With the movements restricted by the venue, they wanted to be fast but failed, and Shanghai's Zong Lan scored first, and Mingyuan repeatedly scored, and Indonesia trailed 0-11, and the forward's mentality was greatly affected. In a panic, they made long-range shots that were ineffective, and Huang Ruiliang replaced Li Xiuli, who scored one point as soon as she came on stage, breaking the egg record in the first quarter, and Indonesia trailed 13-2. The second quarter was 23-9, and Indonesia still showed no improvement. In the third quarter, Indonesia's shooting gradually got on track, and Gui Xin, Yu Ying, and Ruiliang each scored a point, and Mingyuan also showed her skills, and Li Xiuli re-entered the arena, and Ruiliang left the field, and Xiuli used her figure to wait under the basket to seize the ball, and scored in the gap, and at the end of the third quarter, they chased to 31-20. In the last quarter, Gui Xin scored two points first, making it 31-24, and the score gradually approached, and the audience applauded and cheered. Mingyuan made a free throw, and Yu Ying scored a point, making it 32-26, and Indonesia was only three goals behind. Shanghai's forwards stepped up the pressure, making it 40-29, and Mingyuan and Xiuli committed double fouls, Mingyuan made the free throw but Xiuli missed, Wang Shan committed her fourth invading foul and was penalized to leave the field, and Wang Wuli replaced her, and Xiuli made a free throw, winning three points in a row. Unfortunately, the time had arrived, and Indonesia ultimately lost with a score of 41-32 due to the loss of form in the first half, unable to catch up.

### Indonesian Women's Basketball Team Members Play Barefoot

The Combined Services Team Seems Like a Whirlwind

[Our Report] The Shanghai vs. Indonesia Women's Basketball Championship game was held at the Grand Venue Gymnasium in the evening. The Indonesian team wore red clothes and red pants, and some people called them "Red Boys."

Before the game, the Indonesian captain presented the Shanghai team with a green triangular pennant, and the Shanghai captain Huang Mingyuan accepted it personally. Both sides were courteous.

Indonesian team members Chen Lanying, Li Xingniang, and Chen Jinsong all played barefoot.

Although the Indonesian team lost, they still retreated with three cheers.

In the Shanghai vs. Combined Services men's basketball game, Shanghai won by one goal, and the Combined Services lost with honor.

The Shanghai team dribbled slowly, and the Combined Services team dribbled quickly. One was "lukewarm water," and the other was a "whirlwind." One was as quiet as a virgin, and the other was as agile as a fleeing rabbit.

The Shanghai team's skills were better, but their stamina was not enough, and there were many flaws in the second half. Bao Songyuan collided with a Combined Services player once and happened to hurt his lower body, which was very embarrassing. After the game, the audience clamored to question the referee, but fortunately the military police were deployed tightly, and nothing happened.

The audience's emotions seemed to sympathize with the visiting team. Some people said, "Because the tournament is held in Shanghai, the tournament must not make Shanghai lose all popular support." (Wen Zhong)

### Random Thoughts by the Track and Field: The Elusive Wang Shugui, Making Reporters Run in Circles

[Our Report] Whenever Taiwanese athletes appear, the routine is always warm-up exercises, every day without interruption, which always gives a good impression.

In the women's 60-meter final, Taiwanese athlete Guo Meili came in fifth and almost cried, saying that "the start was too slow." Male athletes repeatedly patted her on the shoulder to comfort her.

Pamphlets were all over the track. Although they were distributed early, they did not have an impact, but athletes still considered them a visual obstruction.

Beijing's female all-around champion Xian Shaomei did not run before throwing the javelin, but stood still and swayed a few times before throwing it, and the results were very poor.

Taiwanese female athlete Zhang Ruiyan's javelin had good momentum and sufficient strength. Every time the javelin landed, the Taiwanese athletes in the stands applauded for a while. As a result, she won the championship, and she smiled so much that her mouth could not close when she received the award.

At each event, there are always two white-clad angels standing by, their clothes ironed straight and snow-white dazzling, making them easy to spot.

In the men's 200-meter final, the top three were all Taiwanese. The team leader took their hands and jumped and cheered in the field.

Qingdao's female athlete Wang Shugui, number 45, won the 60-meter race and then won the championship in the fourth leg of the 400-meter relay. After running to the finish line both times, she suddenly disappeared. She was elusive, making many photographers "run in circles."

Seven or eight out of ten people who came to the venue today were watching Lou Wen'ao's 10,000-meter race. At exactly 3:41, the gun sounded and the competition began. The audience around was entranced, and the applause filled their ears.

The deaf-mutes Lou Xisan and Gu Guanyuan came to "cheer silently," holding four paper flags with the words "Overwhelm the Heroes" and "Break the National Record" written on them, raising their thumbs and just yelling.

Before Lou Wen'ao started, he drank enough distilled water. The people who came with him gestured and talked to him a lot.

When the Xinjiang 10,000-meter athlete drew lots, he could not understand the referee's number report and drew the wrong lot several times. Later, he simply stood with his back to the referee and let the referee see the number himself.

Air Force's Yu Xiwei ran the 100-meter race and then ran the 10,000-meter race. Everyone said they were worried that he would fail.

Lou Wen'ao wore a yellow vest and white shorts. Within twenty laps, he led every lap. Every time he passed a place, there was a lot of noise, but unfortunately he could not enjoy this enthusiasm.

The two Xinjiang athletes, Yahafu and Amudula, were five laps behind Lou Wen'ao, but they still ran the last three or four places. Their spirit was commendable, and the entire audience gave them warm applause.

Hong Kong's Zhu Fuxing wore a bright red vest and shorts for the pole vault. When he climbed to the top of the pole, he was eye-catching because of the bright colors, and the audience cheered continuously, but unfortunately he failed in the end and was not on the list.

In the 1,600-meter relay race, many spectators said, "Taiwan's Chen Yinglang is running the fourth leg, so what else is there to say?"

At the 200-meter final, the starter said to the athletes, "Today I am using a very big gun, very loud!" (Yuchang)

### Athletes Visit Swimming Pool, Tournament Provides Hospitality on Different Days

### Three Groups, Northeast, North China, Taiwan, Appeal for the Dalian Football Team Incident and Provide Three Suggestions to the All-China Games Authorities

[Our Report] The northeast athletes' group leader, Liu Huakun, and the Tianjin athletes' group leader, Zhao Yaofu, representing the northeast, north China, and Taiwan groups, met with reporters yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to discuss the All-China Games' handling of the incident in which Dalian football players beat the referee. They believed that the handling method decided by the tournament's judicial committee was excessive and unfair, and in order to resolve this incident satisfactorily, they hoped that it would be reconsidered and a reasonable handling method adopted.

Northeast's team leader Liu Huakun first reported that it was not easy for the northeast to send representatives to participate in the All-China Games under the current difficult circumstances. The northeast athletes have been under enemy and puppet rule for a long time, and the main significance of their participation this time is to let them see the situation in the country and increase the cohesion of the northeast people. The unfortunate incident that occurred a few days ago, the impolite behavior of the Dalian players should be punished, but it is unreasonable for the tournament to punish the entire Dalian team so severely and even cancel their eligibility to participate in the next All-China Games because of the excessive actions of one or two players. The Dalian team has not yet received a notice from the tournament and hopes that it will not be implemented, otherwise the northeast delegation will not accept it.

Tianjin's team leader Zhao Yaofu said that the meaning of the National Games is first to promote sports and second to connect the feelings of various places. Young people inevitably take excessive actions due to temporary emotional impulses. The tournament's handling of such incidents should be based on the principle of educational guidance, so that the transgressors know how to correct their mistakes and resolve the matter satisfactorily. However, this time, the Dalian players were first sent to the police station and then planned to be prosecuted in court. This method is not the attitude that the tournament should have. As for canceling Dalian's eligibility and notifying the Shenyang Municipal Government to hold the Dalian football instructor accountable, it is even more inappropriate. The North China and Taiwan delegations witnessed this situation and, in order to break the deadlock, now put forward several opinions, hoping that the tournament will adopt them: (1) Maintain the dignity of the tournament and the referees, (2) Deal with this matter in an educational spirit, turning big things into small things and small things into nothing, and not engage in legal proceedings. (3) Give the northeast delegation the opportunity to review and deal with the offending players themselves. The punishment of the Dalian players will be the responsibility of the northeast delegation leader Liu Huakun. The above-mentioned points were to be contributed to the secretary-general Hao Gengsheng and the chief referee Zhang Boling by the three groups so that they can be reasonably resolved and avoid the recurrence of future unfortunate incidents. Zhang Tieshan, the leader of the Yunnan Women's Basketball Team, also stood up and spoke in his private capacity at the reception, believing that: (1) There have been three beating incidents in the tournament, and Dalian should not be punished so severely alone. (2) The northeast has been occupied by Japan for fourteen years, and emotionally, the northeast representatives should be given special treatment and should never be given special punishment in return.

Finally, the reporter asked what attitude would be adopted if the negotiation failed. Zhao Yaofu replied that we are not formally protesting, but only providing opinions, hoping that the tournament will accept them. If the tournament does not accept them, the North China and Taiwan delegations will have nothing to do with it. What the northeast will do will depend on how the situation develops. In short, as children of the Republic of China, we hope that this matter can be resolved reasonably.

### Swimming Competition Admission Tickets: 400,000 Each

[Our Dispatch] The National Games swimming competition is scheduled to officially commence today at 10:00 AM. To limit the number of spectators, the organizing committee resolved yesterday to issue a maximum of 4,000 admission tickets daily, priced at 400,000 each. Besides the ticket booths at the venue only selling tickets for the current day, advance sales will also be available at the Post Office Savings Bank on Jiujiang Road, the Shanghai Municipal Bank, and the Bank of Communications on Hankou Road.

It is anticipated that the swimming competition will draw an unprecedented crowd. As a precautionary measure, the organizing committee's engineering committee has decided to densely arrange thick wooden posts within the railings of the grandstand, creating a double line of defense to prevent a recurrence of the railing collapse. Concurrently, the organizing committee has also decided to strengthen security measures with full force, and no one will be allowed to enter the venue without a ticket. According to the person in charge of the police technical team yesterday, the team had already prepared in advance and decided to deploy a large number of police officers to surround the swimming pool, claiming, "We guarantee that not even a fly can get in."

Do Not Drop Leaflets Over the Pool

The National Games Organizing Committee issued a notice on the 11th, requesting relevant authorities who have been scattering leaflets from airplanes to refrain from doing so over the swimming pool, lest the leaflets fall into the water, clog the pipes, and impede cleaning, affecting the competition. Swimming competition today

Four Days of Revenue: 1.6 Billion

The swimming competition will last for four consecutive days starting today, with 4,000 tickets sold each day at 400,000 each, which means that the daily ticket revenue of the swimming pool could reach 1.6 billion. Chen Zhang'e mentioned: Three of the five Philippine swimming representatives have caught a cold from swimming practice and are feeling unwell, but they will still give it their all in the events they have entered, despite their illness.

### Men's Volleyball Championship: Hong Kong Wins Over Guangzhou, Why Must Brothers Fight Each Other So Fiercely!

Equal in Strength, A Cataclysmic Battle, The Audience Shouts: "Hong Kong is Great!"

[Our Dispatch] The men's volleyball round-robin championship was held yesterday at the Municipal Gymnasium. The Guangzhou team, generally considered a contender for the championship, was defeated by Hong Kong with a score of three to one. Another match, Shanghai vs. Police, originally scheduled for yesterday afternoon, was temporarily postponed.

The Guangzhou-Hong Kong match was essentially a battle of Cantonese volleyball talents. The two teams were evenly matched in skill, and the intensity of the fight and the ferocity of the battle were unprecedented, making it the most astonishing scene since the start of the volleyball competition.

The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

In the first and second games, the Hong Kong team employed clever strategic attacks, such as the middle blocker in the front row jumping up as if to spike, but in an instant, a killer from the second row would fly out and quickly slam a shot into the opponent's open space. At the same time, the three players in the front row locked the net extremely well, causing the Guangzhou team's continuous fierce attacks to repeatedly fail. As a result, Hong Kong won the first and second games easily, with scores of 21-11 and 21-13.

By the third game, the Guangzhou team finally recognized the Hong Kong team's tactics and saw through their strategy, launching a courageous counterattack. The fierce battle reached its climax. When the score reached 13-14, neither side would give an inch, returning spike for spike and kill for kill. Chen Yingkuan of the Guangzhou team and Zhong Shiyuan of the Hong Kong team both repeatedly dived to save the ball, fighting for every inch of ground. The ball was spiked back and forth for nearly a minute, and the audience was ecstatic. It was truly incredibly exciting! But at this time, the Hong Kong team felt the pressure from Li Lianze, Zhao Lianwu, etc., and lost to the Guangzhou team with a score of 16-21. In the fourth round, Guangzhou pressed forward step by step, and the Hong Kong team felt slightly overwhelmed. Their net locking was not as tight as in the first two games, and Guangzhou won against Hong Kong again with a score of 21-10.

The fifth game began, and both teams were determined to win, resulting in multiple ties. However, the Hong Kong team was calm and composed, unlike the Guangzhou team, which was prone to panic (especially the middle blocker in the third row, whose constant shouting sapped the team's morale), and ultimately narrowly won the fifth game with a score of 21-18, securing the victory.

During the middle of yesterday's match, the competition was once nearly suspended due to Guangzhou's repeated disputes with the referees, which caused a conflict. Fortunately, the Hong Kong team's coach had excellent sportsmanship, restrained his players, and was happy to accept the referees' opinions without hesitation. The audience shouted, "Hong Kong is great! Hong Kong's sportsmanship is great!"

Police vs. Shanghai Clash This Morning

The men's volleyball round-robin match between the Police and Shanghai, originally scheduled for yesterday afternoon, was temporarily postponed. The organizing committee has now decided to reschedule it for 10:00 AM today. In addition, the men's volleyball repechage match, Zhejiang vs. Xinjiang, will start at 9:00 AM this morning, and Jilin vs. Hunan will start at 10:00 AM. Both will be held at the volleyball court in the Municipal Stadium.

### On the Volleyball Court: Kill! Kill! Kill!

[Our Dispatch] For the women's volleyball championship match between Shanghai and Hunan, the stands of the Municipal Gymnasium were filled with Hunan natives, especially soldiers.

When the match began, the Shanghai cheering squad took the lead, but the Hunan soldiers refused to be outdone, shouting bugle calls. All that could be heard was, "Kill! Kill! Kill!" - a continuous stream of shouts of "Kill!"

After Shanghai won the first set, the emotions in the stands became increasingly tense. Many people believed that the refereeing was unfair and shouted with raised arms, "Damn it, fight!" Seeing that the situation was not good, the Shanghai cheering squad quickly lowered their flags and retreated.

Many unrelated spectators were mixed in the middle, subconsciously shouting loudly, stimulating the atmosphere of the venue, which was really undesirable.

The next match was the Fangzi volleyball match between Hong Kong and Guangzhou. Although they were both from the same province of Guangdong, the emotions were also quite tense. Both sides questioned the referee several times. Someone said, "It's really not easy to be a referee for the organizing committee."

Guangzhou initially lost two sets in a row, and only managed to pull one back in the third set. A member of the Guangzhou cheering squad said, "It's really dangerous. If we get a duck egg [shutout], how will we have the face to go back to Shamian?"

The Zhejiang women's volleyball team has suffered repeated defeats. Because the team members are all female students from Zhejiang University and the final exams are approaching, the team leader Shen Fangxia applied to the organizing committee for permission to withdraw from the repechage match. The entire team is scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to Hangzhou today. (Zhong Yu)

### Good Things Take Time, Women's Volleyball Round Robin, Unnecessary Complications Arise, Cheering Squads Exuberantly Shout "Fight, Fight, Fight," The Match Cannot Be Completed and Has to Be Stopped, Stopped, Stopped

[Our Dispatch] The women's volleyball round-robin finals for the four seeded teams began on the 9th. The Shanghai team, which is highly touted to win the championship, has already defeated Taiwan first, and the Hunan women's army, which has high hopes for second place, has also defeated Guangzhou by a large margin. The two teams met yesterday morning at the Municipal Gymnasium. Both sides had cheering squads, with Hunan having two squads, totaling about a hundred people.

Shanghai-Hunan Scoring Issue to be Discussed and Resolved Today

After Shanghai won the first game with a score of 21-4, the Hunan cheering squad believed that the referee Zhong Zhiqiang had made a mistake in the refereeing and repeatedly shouted "Fight," creating a tense situation. Soon, the Shanghai cheering squad accepted the advice of a third party and stopped cheering.

When the third game was in progress, the atmosphere of the court was abnormal, and the audience felt that it was a great damper. The Shanghai players also performed abnormally, and the Hunan team won with a score of 21-17.

The third game began, and both sides were determined to win. After fighting to a tie at 16, Shanghai scored, and the score was 17-16. The Hunan cheering squad believed that the Shanghai team had hit the ball four times in a row, which was a foul, and shouted "Fight" again, preparing to rush into the court. Fortunately, the barbed wire fence blocked them, and a large number of police officers arrived to maintain order, preventing an accident. However, the Hunan cheering squad insisted that the 17th point earned by the Shanghai team should be invalidated, while the Shanghai team held the opposite view and was unwilling to sacrifice the 17th point. As a result, the match was suspended, and the issue of the 17th point was handed over to the organizing committee for resolution. The organizing committee has scheduled a forum to be held today to discuss and resolve it.

The lineups of the Shanghai and Hunan teams are attached below:

Taiwan Defeats Guangzhou by a Large Margin, Presenting a One-Sided Situation

In the afternoon, Taiwan met Guangzhou, and the situation became one-sided. The Taiwan team won 2-0. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

The front, middle, and back rows of the Guangzhou team were all very weak. They were mostly afraid to pounce and save the "attack balls" served by the Taiwan team, while the Taiwan team's one kill and one slam in the front row on the left and the second row on the right often left the Guangzhou team with no way to parry. Therefore, in the first and second games, the two teams lost with a difference of 10-21.

The Taiwan team's performance yesterday was much more advanced than before. Although they were shorter in stature, they did not suffer because of it. What was particularly commendable was the spirit of the Taiwanese ladies in obeying the referee and their sportsmanship. After each match, regardless of winning or losing, the entire Taiwan team would gather in front of the net, salute and shake hands with each team member of the opposing team, indicating that ball skills and feelings were two different things.

### Shanghai Women's Volleyball Dispute, The Organizing Committee Accepts Protest Letters

[Our Dispatch] Regarding the dispute in the round-robin match between the Shanghai and Hunan women's volleyball teams, both teams have formally submitted protests to the organizing committee, and their protest letters have been submitted to the documentation group of the organizing committee. The adjudication committee convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon for this purpose.

It is reported that the organizing committee has accepted the protest letters from both teams and has scheduled another meeting of the adjudication committee to be held at 10:00 AM today, presided over by Wang Zhengting himself, to seek a reasonable solution as quickly as possible and not to delay. The organizing committee stated that this precedent should not be set, otherwise future matches will not be able to continue. The solution will be based on fairness as the principle, and the final decision can be made today.

It is also learned that the main content of the Hunan team's protest letter is that the order of events stated that volleyball should be held outdoors, but the result was changed to indoors, which is unfair, and they request that the venue be changed back to outdoors. On the Shanghai side, it was stated that the actions of some of the Hunan cheering squad's spectators were clearly in violation of the rules of sports and affected the results. They asked the organizing committee to uphold justice and demanded that the 17 points already obtained must be recognized.

### Table Tennis Competition with a Variety of Styles, Women's Finale Brings Unexpected Upsets, Yang Weibin Overwhelms Liu Yunu, Liang Yujie Defeats Sun Meiying

[Our Dispatch] The four men's and women's table tennis round-robin matches held at the Assembly Hall Gymnasium yesterday morning were extremely intense. In the women's division, unexpected upsets occurred. Yang Weibin from Guangzhou unexpectedly defeated Liu Yunu from Taiwan, and Sun Meiying from Shanghai lost to Liang Yujie from Hong Kong. In the men's division, Xue Xuchu from Shanghai easily defeated You Ruheng from Malaysia, and Wang Youxin from Taiwan narrowly defeated Zhong Zhancheng from Hong Kong. In addition, there were eight repechage matches, five of which were forfeited, so only three repechage matches remained, serving as the finale of yesterday's table tennis competition.

At 9:00 AM sharp, Liang Yujie (Hong Kong) and Sun Meiying (Shanghai) were the first to take the stage, winning the first game with a score of 12-10. Liang then won the second game with a difference of 11-4. In the third game, Sun took the offensive and powerfully drew against Liang, ultimately losing the third game with a score of 7-11. After that, Liang played steadily, calmly responding to the challenge, and won two consecutive games with scores of 11-9 and 11-7. She narrowly defeated Sun Meiying from Shanghai 3-2.

Sighing and Moaning, Quite Entertaining

In the second act, Wang Youxin (Taiwan) encountered Zhong Zhancheng (Hong Kong). The first game was extremely exciting. Whenever either of them made a mistake, they would either sigh to the sky or pat their thighs and moan. Zhong Zhancheng won the first game first with a score of 15-13. Wang Youxin was extremely angry and stomped his feet, breaking a ball, because Zhong had luckily won a point (the ball touched the corner of the table). In the second game, Wang tied the score with 11-4. In the third game, Zhong won another game with 11-9. At this time, the audience cheered Wang Youxin on, and Wang then used all his skills, winning twice with scores of 11-4 and 11-8. As a result, Zhong was defeated 3-2.

In the match between Xue Xuchu (Shanghai) and You Ruheng (Malaysia), You Ruheng lowered his head with a score of 3-1. (Scores were 11-9, 11-6, 8-11, 11-8.)

Husband Helps in Battle, Wife Gains Courage

In the finale, Liu Yunu from Taiwan played against Yang Weibin from Guangzhou. Yang's husband, the famous tennis player Ye Guanxiong, also watched from the sidelines, cheering for Yang. After Liu and Yang made contact, Liu immediately gained the upper hand, winning the first game with 11-5. In the second game, Liu's actions were scattered, while Yang maintained a serious style, with no smile on her face, winning with 11-9. Unexpectedly, Liu Yunu was unwilling to fight, while Yang Weibin became more and more courageous, winning all consecutive battles. She won the third game with a score of 11-4. In the final game, although Liu Yunu tried her best to fight like a trapped beast, the overall situation was over, and she was unable to recover, losing to Yang Weibin with a score of 1-3, which was unexpected.

### Overseas Chinese Athletes from Vietnam Visit Beijing, Present Flag to Chairman

### Men's Softball Round-Robin Finals to be Held Today at Yiyuan, Taiwan and Guangzhou Teams are Formidable, Among the Eliminated Teams, Fujian is Full of Talent

[Our Dispatch] The final four teams in the Men's Softball Championship have been determined, and the round-robin finals are scheduled to begin today. The first match, Taiwan vs. Police, will be held at Yiyuan at 9:00 AM. The Police team is represented by the Taiwan Athletes team. Their defense in both the infield and outfield is excellent, but the pitcher's soft throws are inevitably exploited by the enemy. Therefore, it will be difficult to win today's battle against Taiwan, which is the most highly touted team.

In the second match, Shanghai will play against Guangdong. The Shanghai players are all from "Panda," and their defense is excellent, but their hitting is not ideal. On the Guangdong side, the elites from Hong Kong and Guangzhou are melted into one, and their strength is naturally strong. In this battle between tigers and dragons, it is unknown who will win.

In the men's repechage match, Fujian vs. Zhejiang, the former has many good players. Last time, they only lost to the Police by one point. Today, taking Zhejiang should be easy.

In the women's softball match, Shanghai will also play against Guangdong. The Shanghai team is composed of the elite from Yue Da, Maria, and Zhongxi schools, and they are all students of Liang Fuchu, inheriting a consistent style, with close coordination and tacit understanding, which is naturally superior. On the Guangdong side, in addition to the pitcher Ma Lianxiu being particularly strong, there are no other notable features. Today's victory or defeat will depend on whether the Shanghai hitters can escape the danger of Ma Lianxiu's three throws.

In another match, Nanjing vs. Gansu, the strength of these two dark horses is impossible to predict. Whether the two teams can compete with Shanghai and Guangdong will only be known after the battle. (Xin)

### Predictions of Rankings in Men's and Women's Volleyball

â€” Special Correspondent Liang You Ting

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] After watching several days of intense volleyball competitions, the general public now has a rough idea of the potential rankings for the men's and women's teams. Specifically: the men's championship is most likely to go to Hong Kong or Guangzhou, with Hong Kong having the best chance; the police team and Shanghai are likely to contend for third and fourth place, with the police team appearing stronger than Shanghai.

Originally, the Guangzhou men's volleyball team was considered a strong contender for the championship. However, veteran players Li Fushen (middle of the third row) and Qiu Guangxie (left of the second row) were unable to participate, leading to a 2-3 loss to Hong Kong in yesterday's round-robin matches. At the same time, the strength displayed by Hong Kong in yesterday's match, with its free-flowing offense and defense, has led the audience to re-evaluate Hong Kong and consider them as having a very high chance of taking first place.

Seven Advantages of the Hong Kong Team

In the reporter's opinion, the Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Police teams all have their strengths and weaknesses. Whether the Hong Kong team can secure the championship depends on luck. However, the Hong Kong team has undeniable advantages: (1) Their blocking technique is top-notch, the best among all the strong teams. Therefore, they don't seem seriously threatened by teams that are good at offensive plays like the Guangzhou and Police teams; (2) They are quite skilled in using tactics to cover their offensive direction, making it difficult for the opponent to predict the ball's trajectory; (4) Approximately five or six players are good at serving attacking balls, making the team's overall strength very balanced; (5) Yu Qien on the left of the second row is a reliable killer, with a good grasp of how to quickly spike the ball; (6) Zhong Shiyuan, the center of the third row, is an outstanding talent in the third row, with unique skills in diving to save the ball and assisting spikes. He is by no means inferior to any of the center players in the other three strong teams; (7) The Hong Kong team members are all seasoned veterans, good at calmly responding to challenges and playing a steady game.

Based on the above reasons, the Hong Kong team should logically not miss out on the championship. However, the Hong Kong team's only weakness is that their offense is less developed than their defense. If they suffer a loss, it will likely be due to this.

Police Team Full of Vitality

Next, let's talk about the Police team: this team is full of vitality, based on the Guangdong Taishan Middle School team. They have won the Guangdong Provincial Games championship, but their biggest weaknesses are lack of experience and poor blocking skills. Their offense lacks deceptive strategies, which is exactly the opposite of the Hong Kong team. From this reporter's perspective, the Police volleyball team is no match for the Hong Kong team.

Guangzhou is Also Strong

As for the current lineup of the Guangzhou team, the most capable players are likely the front-row player Li Lianze, the back-row player Chen Yingkuan, and Zhao Lianwu in the second row. In reality, their strength is comparable to that of Hong Kong, but their blocking is not as strong as the Hong Kong team. They are not as composed as the Hong Kong team during tense moments and tend to panic when making mistakes. Therefore, they lost to Hong Kong this time. However, if the Guangzhou team encounters the Police and Shanghai teams, the outcome will be different.

Shanghai Team Has Difficulty Against Southern Teams

Finally, let's talk about the Shanghai men's volleyball team: everyone knows that their strength is far less than that of the Shanghai team in the previous National Games. Moreover, before the National Games, "Hua Yan" lost a friendly match against the Hong Kong team, which further demonstrates that Shanghai's volleyball is difficult to compete with Southern teams. This time, the Shanghai team is facing three Guangdong teams (Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Police), so their future is not optimistic. However, the Shanghai team also has strong players like Huang Yaohua (center of the third row), Wei Dingyi (center of the second row), Weng Chengguang, and Zheng Yiquan. If they can coordinate well, they won't be completely defeated. However, Zheng Yiquan's and Weng Chengguang's offensive plays may be blocked by the opponents, especially when the Shanghai team encounters the Hong Kong and Guangzhou teams.

The Overall Women's Volleyball Situation is Set

Regarding the situation in women's volleyball, there is actually no need to elaborate much, because three round-robin matches have already been played. The issue lies in the temporary changes that occurred during the Shanghai-Hunan match and how the organizing committee will handle it. However, regardless of the outcome, in terms of skills, the Shanghai team seems to be in the lead for the championship. Yesterday, the Shanghai team's 21-4 victory in the first round against the Hunan team is clear evidence of this.

Among the four seeded teams, the Guangzhou team is the worst. No matter how the top three are arranged, it is undisputed that the Guangzhou team will be in last place.

Therefore, we can reach a conclusion: Shanghai and Hunan are the most likely contenders for the women's volleyball championship, with Shanghai being even more likely. The Taiwan team also has a chance for second place, but they may also be in third place, while Guangzhou will be in fourth place.

### Jiangxi Tennis Team Manager Yang Bohe Returns to the Team After Recovery

[Report from Our Newspaper] This newspaper reported yesterday that Yang Qinghe, the manager of the Jiangxi representative tennis team, was missing. Yesterday, Mr. Yang personally went to the organizing committee's office to explain the situation, stating that he was invited by former colleagues to visit various places. Later, due to rain and catching a cold, he rested at a friend's place for a few days and did not return to the Shui Dian Road dormitory, nor did he notify the organizing committee by telephone, which led to him being mistakenly reported as missing. He has now recovered, safely returned to the team, and resumed his work. This is disclosed to inform those who care about Mr. Yang.

### New Methods and Principles for Import Settlement and Exchange - The Import Management Committee Decides to Maintain the Original Proposal - Technical Supplements May Be Added to the Implementation

Although the new methods for import settlement and exchange have been communicated through a circular from the Central Bank, the import industry and industrial associations believe that there are difficulties in implementing them, and have requested that the order be withdrawn. It is reported that the Central Bank and the Import Management Committee have decided to maintain the original proposal and thoroughly implement it. However, technical supplements may be added to the implementation.

In addition, regarding the guarantee order, the designated bank association has increased from 50% to 100%, with 50% paid in cash and another 50% paid in national treasury bonds. According to the person in charge of the designated bank association, if importers only pay 50%, the responsibility of the designated bank is too great, so it is necessary to collect 100%. Importers can also earn interest on the 50% of national treasury bonds, so there is no loss to the original settler.

### Industrial Associations Decide Through Discussion that the New Law Should Be Passed by the Legislative Yuan

[Central News Agency, This City] In order to discuss the new import settlement and exchange methods recently announced by the Import Management Committee, the sixfold advance payment of the 36th year profit tax, and the issue that same-day checks cannot be cashed, the industrial associations of this city held a discussion meeting at the Xing Wu Restaurant at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Representatives from the Shanghai Industrial Association, Zhejiang Industrial Association, and more than 60 industrial associations such as rubber, household chemicals, and cigarettes expressed their opinions, and the following decisions were made on the spot: (1) The new methods enacted by the Import Management Committee, such as the recently promulgated new import settlement and exchange methods, must be discussed and passed by the Legislative Yuan before they can take effect. (2) Before the Legislative Yuan discusses the case, the Import Management Committee should handle everything in accordance with the old methods. (3) Settlement and exchange for raw materials imported under the fourth-quarter quota should be cleared with the factories within a specified time limit. (4) The Supervisory Yuan should be requested to investigate and announce the use of all non-quota foreign exchange in the past. (5) Wu Yun Chu, Jin Run Xiang, Tian He Qing, Yang Li Ren, Hong Nian Zu, Jing Shu Ping, Pan Shi Hao, Dong Shu Ying, Zhang Shan Bu, and Hu Junmei, the representative of the Zhejiang Industrial Association, were elected as representatives to visit the Import Management Committee and the Central Bank authorities this morning (the 12th) to present the above matters in person. (6) Regarding the sixfold advance payment of the 36th year profit tax, the Industrial Association will take the lead in sending a letter to the direct tax bureau together with the industrial associations, requesting that the difficulties of the industrial sector be considered and not strictly urged to pay the full amount within a limited time. (7) A request is submitted to the Ministry of Finance to allow checks for industrial production to be used for redemption on the same day.

### Gauze Continues to Rise

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was active due to the easing of money supply and positive environmental news. Merchants from Tianjin, Guangdong, the Yangtze River region, and other regions were restless, and new purchases and short covering proceeded simultaneously. The market atmosphere reached its peak, and 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn set a new high of 342 million yuan. Before the close, floating accounts took profits and fell back to 335 million yuan, an increase of 20 million yuan compared to the previous day. 21-count Double Horse yarn was frequently sold by Guangdong merchants, and there was also speculative buying by retail investors, also setting a new record of 236 million yuan. By the close, profits were taken, and the result was a further increase of 8 million yuan. Other coarse and fine yarns also rose by 11.2 million to 20 million yuan.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market initially opened similarly to the previous day, with a weak external situation. Then, financial items soared, and the market sentiment was consistent. Customer merchants competed fiercely for purchases. Cloth merchants and retail investors competed to enter the market, and the buying atmosphere was strong again. 12-pound Leading Brand fine cloth opened in the morning at 6.6 million yuan, and the market price rose all the way to 6.9 million yuan at the close, an increase of 550,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

Also, the supply price of Leading Brand fine cloth from the Textile Construction Company was 6.8 million yuan, and the highest addition to the purchase order was 250,000 yuan. Later, it was sold low at 80,000 yuan due to floating short selling. Finally, the Leading Brand fine cloth was transacted at 6.88 million yuan with an acceptor.

### Rayon Rises First and Then Falls - Silk Fabrics Continue to Rise

The rayon market yesterday fluctuated greatly, rising in the morning and falling sharply in the afternoon. The result was similar to the previous day's price. 120-count Asahi brand bright rayon opened high in the morning at 445 million yuan, with a maximum transaction of 61 million yuan. The afternoon close retreated to 55 million yuan for the next-day price. The market opened at 56 million yuan in the afternoon, but was stimulated by news of profitable sales, and the market price gradually declined. The closing price was 426 million yuan.

Factory-made yesterday's market followed the remaining momentum of the previous afternoon and rose, with the highest spot price in the morning reaching 540 million yuan. There were ten packages of Tiger Brand D grade throw goods traded, with a price of 540 million yuan. There were still no transactions for various grades of Five Ancestor goods.

### Woolen Fabrics Have High Prices and Stagnant Sales

Due to the rapid rise in woolen fabrics, buyers restrained themselves, and the actual sales of shops all fell sharply. The rapid rise in spot prices caused confusion both inside and outside the industry. The path of Western-style clothing materials for local merchants suddenly turned deserted. Yesterday, when inspecting woolen fabric and Western-style clothing merchants in various districts, a slightly decent Western-style suit required 35 to 36 million national currency, and a robe material required 20 million yuan.

### Foreign Stocks Continue to Be Bullish

Foreign stocks rose again yesterday, fueled by external forces. Securities dealers, remittance dealers, money exchangers, and merchants all participated. Yisha rose from 5.4 million in the morning to a new high of 5.68 million, and then declined before the close. The same trend was seen in other stocks. External stimulus also showed signs of loosening. The closing price retreated close to the morning opening line. The overall situation was volatile. Large investors were gathering stocks in Yisha and Guangyi. Due to positive environmental news, the former rose by 10% and the latter rose by a strong 5%. Union Insurance, Aviation, Shipping, and Rubber stocks rose by about 5%, while Jardine Matheson stock rose slightly. Paper stocks were the most disappointing, falling slightly.

Yesterday, Chaozhou merchants absorbed public bonds Dingwu and Junde, and the types 500, 555, and 556 were purchased, while 503 and 614 were sold.

Compared with the previous close, Jia, Yi, Ding, and Wu each rose by 10,000 yuan, and Bing rose by 17,000 yuan. The trading volume was about 6 million.

### Strict Investigation Rumors - Chinese Stocks Turn from Bullish to Weak

Yesterday, Chinese stocks turned from bullish to weak, and the same was true for external stimulus. Yongsha first set a new high of 3275 yuan, and Xin Guang and Jingfu were price-limited and then sold at a discount. In the afternoon, due to external pressure, a reverse wind rose, and before the close.

The morning opening was stable, with Yongsha opening at 3180 yuan, first seeing a low price of 3160 yuan, and then advancing to 3240 yuan. Handling fees opened high at 26 yuan and 30 yuan, and retreated to 3215 yuan. No. 149 and others strongly purchased, and foreign stocks and off-market materials became bullish again, rising to 3265 yuan. After Xin Guang and Jingfu were price-limited, there were no suppliers, and they continued to be sold at a discount. With the tightening of accounting checks, many parties had settlements, and then retreated into the 3200 yuan level. Soon after, they were advanced again to a new high of 3275 yuan. No. 69 and others sold short in groups, and floating shorts were settled in time. The price fell to a low of 3165 yuan near noon. The afternoon close was 3210 yuan. Except for Xin Guang and Jingfu Zhongxing reaching the price limit, Huaxin fell by half a percent, Rongfeng fell slightly, and Xinhua and Huafeng were flat, the rest all rose slightly or by no more than half a percent.

In the afternoon market, Yongsha was at 3210 yuan, and Xin Guang and Jingfu were still price-limited. Yongsha's sharpness gradually subsided. Although No. 35 and others advanced to 3240 yuan, rumors of police cracking down on the securities market made people nervous. The price initially fell to 3085 yuan. The Hong Kong telegram shrank, and peers arrived at 3160 yuan. Accounting checks became stricter, with a large number of accounts. Off-market accounts also loosened. Under the short selling, the price was forced down to a low of 3040 yuan, and the closing price was 3085 yuan. Compared with the morning close, Xinyi and Zhongsi were flat, Huaxin rose slightly, Xin Guang and Jingfu reached the price limit, and the rest all fell slightly or by no more than half a percent. Off-market unlisted stocks generally rose by half a percent to one percent because they were only traded for half a day in the morning.

### Rice Prices Slightly Stabilize - Oil, Flour, and Miscellaneous Grains Soar

Yesterday's rice market was stable and uneventful. The lack of price fluctuations in the Xishi market compared to the previous day turned the excited hearts to calm. Prices in the northern and southern markets were no different from the previous day. Northern market white japonica rice remained at 5.5 million, but white round rice rose by 200,000 alone due to scarcity. The southern market opened the cheapest in the morning, and the sales were quite active later. At the close, sellers intended to call for higher prices, but the market had already closed. Yesterday, 4,079 dan of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets.

Flour prices were firmly bullish. There were no transactions in the market due to price controls. The off-market price was seeing goods purchased under the strong absorption of northern merchants, and each flour had jumped out of the 2 million mark. Lao Shi and Bingchuan both closed at 2.1 million yuan, a sharp increase of 170,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Hongfeng and Jiancheng each reached 2.07 million yuan. Only a thousand bags of second-class flour were traded in the market. Wheat bran rose by 120,000, and wheat rose from 3 million to 3.1 million.

Miscellaneous grains continued to advance towards their peak. Arriving soybeans were scarce, and merchants sold less because the price in the producing area was high. The initial opening price was up more than 100,000, and the market rose again because both cakes and oil rose, for a total increase of 300,000. Green beans rose the most sharply, adding 800,000 yuan, and local merchants were all taking them. Gumi was scarce, red sorghum sales were active, and each increased by more than 100,000 yuan. Red beans rose sharply by 1 million, sesame rose by 600,000 to 700,000, and raw peanuts, although they fell the previous day, rose sharply yesterday by 1.5 million to 1.9 million.

The rise in edible oil was extremely fierce. Oil factories had no supply, and the prices in the interior were high. Returned goods opened higher and higher, stack orders were transacted, and speculation was ripe, with prices rising above the price grid. Dayou soybean oil opened at 14 million, and then rose in a straight line to 15.2 million at the close, a huge increase of 2 million. Crude oil rose sharply by more than 2 million, Qingdao Lao Tong crude oil rose to 17 million, raw rapeseed oil rose by 1.5 million, and Xiao Che sesame oil Jixiang barrel was 18 million, a rise of 2 million. Soybean cake skin ball transactions rose sharply by 200,000.

### Import of Raw Materials for Export Manufacturing is Not Restricted by New Exchange Settlement Methods

Suzhou [Our newspaper, Suzhou, 11th] Suzhou rice prices have continued to rise sharply in recent days, and the rise is crazy. Because the government is trying to lower the prices, the market has severely cracked down on the black market. Today, the actual trading price of top-quality white rice in the market has reached 5.5 million, and rice shops are hoarding and reluctant to sell, only using inferior goods to meet the market at the official price. The Suzhou County government believes that the soaring grain prices are causing concern for the lives of the poor, and has recently ordered all towns to investigate the poor in the area, and decided to first withdraw 1,500 dan of stored grain to sell at subsidized prices.

Zhenjiang [Our newspaper, Zhenjiang, 11th] The rise in prices in Zhenjiang has not ended. Top-quality rice opened today at 5.7 million, Green Jinshan flour at 2.1 million, soybean oil prices are extremely chaotic, and white sugar at 12 million.

Hangzhou [Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 11th] Prices in Hangzhou continue to soar, especially for food rice. Coarse rice rose by 230,000, and white round rice has reached 4.6 million. The price of grain in Xiashi is also rising sharply, with each grade soaring by 300,000. Other items also rose sharply with the prices in Shanghai.

Bengbu [Our newspaper, Bengbu, 11th] Grain prices rose sharply and then fell slightly. Long rice fell sharply by a million, the wheat market was sluggish, red sorghum fell, and soybeans were firm.

Hankou [Our newspaper, Hankou, 11th] Rice, grain, and edible oil in Hankou have risen sharply in recent days. Three-pass machine-processed rice is now hitting the 5 million mark. Meat merchants once went on strike to protest price negotiations.

Qingdao [Our newspaper, Qingdao, 11th] Bingchuan flour jumped to 3.5 million on the 11th, rice was 6.5 million per 100 jin, Big Double Dragon cloth was 6.48 million, and 32-count Silver Moon was 260 million. The black market for US dollars rose from 103 to 110,000.

### I am the Son of the Laboring People

â€” Chen Chi

â€” Dedicated to my father, who is 70 years old this year

I am proud

My father

Is a doctor

I am the son

Of the laboring people

Like those with calloused hands and feet

Like those who work at sunrise and rest at sunset

Like those who stand by the furnace, wiping sweat even on snowy days

My father

Is a mental laborer

I am proud

I am from the family

Of the laboring people

I am proud

My father

Is a doctor

And I am diagnosing the world's ailments

An assistant...

Because we must thoroughly heal

This world riddled with disease

Ask about the symptoms

Look clearly at the decaying face

Listen well to the heart's voice:

"As long as it doesn't get a fever again

There is still hope..."

Just because "our first priority

Is to change their spirit"

Otherwise

No matter how healthy

How robust

A foolish and weak nation

Can only be meaningless material

And spectators

Standing by

Watching the Chinese people

Being beheaded for public display..."

And I, I am proud

My father

Is a doctor

And he is constantly fighting

With life, disease, and work

Not only from the edge of death

From the swamp of poverty

From the bed of suffering

Pulling up the sick

Helping up the unfortunate

And also, I am proud

My father

Is a doctor

Using reason, using passion

Using the integrity of the poor

Using the conscience of society

You who have fallen, get up

You who have had your teeth knocked out, swallow the blood

You sick patients who have lost hope in life

The doctor

Will heal you

In your hearts

In your wills

And in the hundreds of holes and sores in your lives

I am proud

My father

Is a doctor

Because

The responsibility of a doctor

Is to preserve the spring of life

To restore the health of this world

For this world

There is still a way to prescribe

Pulling out the source of the disease from the root

There is still hope...

My father

Is a doctor

I am proud

I am the son of the laboring people

Diagnosing the world's ailments

A young assistant...

### Talks on Ju Lai's Seal Manual

â€” Zheng Yimei

I have often recited the verse of a wise man on seals: "The Xuanhe Seal Manual began with one word, Xiao Tang collected antiquities with great effort, later, our Zhao family followed one after another, but none could compare to Ye Jingshu's Shi Yun." It is said that seal manuals began in Yihe. Wang Qiu, also known as Ziben, of the Song Dynasty had the Xiao Tang Collection of Antiquities. Zhao Songxue of the Yuan Dynasty had the History of Seals. Ye Jingshu of Qiantang had the Annotated Illustrations of Han and Tang Seal Carvings; and this trend greatly flourished. In recent times, Zhao Shuru was regarded as a master of seal carving. Since Shuru's passing, Chen Julai has been consistently praised as surpassing his predecessor, having inherited his method. Julai has been engaged in seal carving for more than thirty years, and he is renowned at home and abroad for his Yuan Zhu style. However, he is known for his refined and scholarly spirit and does not keep drafts. Those at home and abroad who admire him have wanted to obtain his seal manual to gain a comprehensive understanding for years, eagerly anticipating it. Yang Pengzhi of Zhongshan, a man of refined taste with a passion for seals, commissioned Julai to carve sixty name seals (forty-one ivory and nineteen stone). Name seals have relatively few variations, but Julai's ingenuity is unique, fully utilizing his ability to create intricate arrangements. Some are half intaglio and half relief, some have three relief characters and one intaglio character, and some have three intaglio characters and one relief character, yet the composition is perfectly integrated. At first glance, the intaglio seems like relief, and the relief seems like intaglio, such is the wonder of it. Some are triangular in the east, some have no borders but have boundary lines in the middle, and some have earthworms and dragons echoing the relief and intaglio characters; those who do not know better might think they were invented, but in reality, each has a source and each has a standard. Looking at them is like seeing a beautiful woman wearing flowers or a court official in ceremonial robes, and the clarity of the bright moon and the expanse of the clouds cannot compare to even a fraction of their splendor. Yang acquired them and vowed to publish a seal manual, naming it Gezhai. Julai specially requested Zhang Ludang to make seal ink, as red as fire agate, bright and dazzling, for the purpose of rubbing the seals. Each seal is rubbed twice, once in red for the relief and once in black for the intaglio, with the side inscriptions rubbed separately afterward, the exquisite beauty of which is rarely seen. It is said that each set of the seal manual will consist of two volumes, to be distributed to libraries across the country, as well as to relatives and friends. A small portion will be given to the Xuanhe Seal Society for sale. Yang's ambition is not to seek profit, but simply to forge connections through calligraphy and painting and to make a contribution to the art world.

### Using Humans as Sacrifices and the Efficacy of Aversion

â€” Kong Linggu

â€”Taking Atayal Mythology as an Exampleâ€”

In the account of Ximen Bao's throwing shamans into the river, we learned about the story of the River God marrying a bride. The River God marrying a bride is a later interpretation; its original meaning was actually the sacrifice of young girls. The story of using humans as sacrifices is often seen in novels. Its origin lies in the idea of sacrificing one person to preserve the group. Its starting point is reasonable, but in Ximen Bao's account, it becomes both superstitious and vulgar.

Using humans as sacrifices has two meanings. The first is the one mentioned above, such as when there are fierce snakes and beasts in the mountains that often devour people. Sending a substitute to die can ensure the safety of a village. The second is related to the efficacy of aversion. An example of the efficacy of aversion can be seen in the legend of the Atayal people of Beishi.

According to the legend of the Atayal people of Beishi, in ancient times, there was a giant rock on Dabajian Mountain. One day, it naturally split open, and two people, a man and a woman, emerged. These were the ancestors of the Atayal people of Beishi. One day, out of curiosity, the two embraced each other, and a golden fly came and taught them about human relations. Thus, four children were born. As the children grew, they married each other, and their descendants multiplied, forming a clan.

At this time, a great flood broke out, increasing day and night, almost reaching the top of the mountain. The clan gathered to discuss, believing that they must have violated a taboo, causing the great god to become angry. They should find a way to appease him and apologize as soon as possible. First, they threw in a dog, but the water continued to rise. Then, they threw in an old man, but the water still increased without decreasing. The clan was terrified and did not know what to do. After a thorough investigation, they discovered that a brother and sister had engaged in secret relations. They threw the brother and sister into the sea, and the flood gradually receded. At that time, the brother was thrown into the Daan River, and the sister was thrown into the Beigang River. Now, there are towering peaks and deep valleys there, which were formed by the flood at that time.

This myth can illustrate that throwing people into the river contains the meaning of aversion. As for people being born from stone, it is a type of myth similar to Yu being born from the stone of Xin. In ancient times, Dayu should have been regarded as the ancestor of a clan.

### Zhimo's Diary

â€” Posthumous Works of Xu Zhimo, Compiled by Chen Congzhou

December 15th. Attended the Red Cross membership solicitation meeting at Mechanic Hall with Po Hongshou. Mrs. Clark delivered a speech on the tragic situation of Germany's invasion of Belgium, the tireless resistance of the Belgian people, and the hardships of the Red Cross. The lady was generous and righteous, moving everyone in the audience. Following her, there was a speech on the situation in Russia and Germany's strategies towards Russia, which was not very exciting. Finally, Mr. Stockton Axson, relative by marriage to President Wilson, secretary of the Red Cross, who had just returned from the battlefield, spoke about the achievements of the Red Cross and its future expansion plans, aiming to provide relief to the world's poor and destitute.

I had two thoughts at the evening's meeting. One was the shock at the foreign women's eagerness to take risks for justice, surpassing even men. Comparing this to our country, where ignorance and obstruction prevail, and the female academic community is mostly indulging in entertainment, showing off strange appearances and decorations to dazzle the world, and using the guise of freedom to indulge in wanton behavior, causing people to feel wary and fearful upon hearing the name of female students!

These people loudly proclaim women's rights, but in reality, they debase and harm themselves. Even if I wanted to respect and honor them, I cannot. Women have a role in the evolution and reform of society and the family. If things are like this, what more can be said! There are a few pioneers who encourage and guide, always with sincere hearts, but the ignorant and stubborn men then ridicule and suppress them. Today, the mention of women's rights is still in its infancy, and they are easily eradicated and wantonly trampled upon. Is this not tragic!

Speaking of the country, one must start with the community, and speaking of the community, one must start with the family. The family is formed by men and women. Therefore, to have the ambition to govern the world, one must also include women. Thus, Zhimo's great dream of managing China adds another major item. Alas! Where can I find a bright and courageous woman!

Another thought is that I have always known the preciousness of time! But I did not know how to cherish it. Looking back on the past, I cannot help but hate my mistakes. Today, I am still groping around, unable to open my own path. The languor of today will become the basis for future laments. Time is passing day by day. Is this not dangerous! My original intention was not only to seek knowledge from books, but also to open my ears and eyes to observe the power and authority of the world, and the essential principles of things, so that I could understand things by analogy and cultivate both my spirit and knowledge. Now, I am confined to the page, even though I have traveled thousands of miles, it is as if I have not gone anywhere. To go out blindly and return confused, one can know the outcome! Is this not dangerous!

It has been seven days since the vacation! Besides writing letters, I have only gathered with others to engage in meaningless small talk. The cold dew locks the empty space, the atmosphere is stagnant and dull, and ice and snow fill the streets, leaving nowhere to go. Even my usual thoughts are obstructed and inflexible. How tired I am! Dao An suggested going to New York, but I declined due to the expense. I think that rather than guarding myself in poverty, I should be bold and open. There are many talented and virtuous people in New York, and I should not miss the opportunity to meet them. Why hesitate to go?

The other day, Jiang Jun came. He used to be a major in the military and is now studying mathematics at Harvard. He is a serious and honest person, but I worry that after returning to China, he will not have a suitable opportunity to focus on his research and will ultimately be unable to compete with scholars around the world, which is a pity! Through Jiang, I learned that Tang Yulu, whom I met once three years ago, is also at Harvard. Yulu is handsome and refreshing, and I have always admired him. In the past, Yuan Longzi recognized him. Therefore, I quickly wrote a letter and sent it to him, describing our past acquaintance. Today, I received a flamboyant and colorful reply, full of warmth. I cannot help but let my spirit drift towards him. When we meet in the future, holding arms and reminiscing about old times will also be a joyful thing.

### Heine's Octaves

â€” Translated by Liao Xiaofan

Your deep blue eyes,
Gaze at me tenderly,
Like dreams filled with warmth,
Silently without words.

Because your deep blue eyes,
Awaken my memories!
The sea, a blue memory,
Flooding in my heart.

### Recent Trends in the World of Literature

â€” Zhao Jingshen

British Pantomime

Every winter in Britain, there must be a pantomime performance. This entertainment starts from Christmas and lasts for one or two months, or even three months. Major theaters in major cities all perform this kind of play. There are no such examples elsewhere, so foreign guests often do not understand it. This is a mixture of fairy tales and music, including sentiment, "slapstick" (two flat wooden boards, one end fastened tightly, the other end loosened, used to indicate the heaviness of the strike when A hits B), dance, and vaudeville. Children like this because they are familiar with many of the jokes. They always feel that they are too old to watch pantomime. Adults also like it because it has childishness. There is no place that the adult mind can imagine. There are also songs in pantomime, which are sung by the performers, or we might call it gesture drama, which is more appropriate.

The current form of British pantomime has only been around for less than a hundred years. At first, it used rhyming poems, full of humor and fantasy. The characters on stage may be Prince Charming of the eighteenth century, wearing a wig and silk clothes. This tradition of poetic drama, recognized by the great talents of the Elizabethan era, has now degenerated into something found in vulgar theaters.

Wearing masks and clowning are what audiences find most interesting. People often imitate animals, wearing animal fur, or men dress as women, or women wear men's clothes. This can still be seen in modern British pantomime.

The protagonist of folk tales and popular legends is often a young woman, who has beautiful legs and a good voice suitable for singing. Therefore, Prince Charming often appears as a woman with beautiful legs, singing a solo in a high voice. She can even sing about recent politics. Conversely, old women are often played by comedic male actors.

Over the years, the songs and rhymes have changed, but the stories are always the same. "Cinderella," "Puss in Boots," and "Little Red Riding Hood" are always performed. Children especially like this. They perform it twice a day and for several weeks after Christmas. Children go to school to study, and adults continue to watch it. Arthur Askey is the most famous actor in pantomime.

The Poetry of Edwin Arlington Robinson

The poetry of the American poet Edwin Arlington Robinson seems to be generally neglected by society and critics. In circles that hotly discuss poetry, his poems are rarely mentioned. However, his poems are highly regarded in circles of more sophisticated scholars, especially his "Captain Craig" and "The Man Who Died Twice." They feel that after Whitman's death and Hardy's old age, Robinson's poetry can be compared to Hardy's.

During his lifetime, he received praise from Amy Lowell. In his dramatic monologue "John Brown," he borrowed a fairy-like person to say: "If I die, I have more to say." Indeed, thirteen years after his death, his new collection of letters was published, and he said a lot. His voice, like the voice in his poem "Luke Havergal," seems to be "coming from the grave to tell you."

The recently published collection of Robinson's letters is the second volume, more than twice the size of the first volume. The first volume was edited by Ridgely Torrence in 1940. The current volume covers the period from 1890 to 1905, including his time at Harvard. These letters were written to Harry DeForest Smith, a childhood friend who later became a professor of Greek at Amherst. Smith was one of the few people Robinson trusted, and he could confide in him about his intentions for writing poetry and the nature of poetry. These letters are particularly moving. Not because he is a letter writer, he simply pours out his honest words.

He wrote in a letter to Smith: "Sometimes I think hell is not so bad. If there is sulfur, it may be a little unpleasant, but I think a person does not need to be afraid of it. Think about his companions. If you and I were sitting on a fiery, red cobblestone reading Daudet and Zola, wouldn't that be a pleasant thing?"

Robinson's reputation as a poet came from effort, not from innate talent. He had been a special student at Harvard; he studied Shakespeare and Hawthorne on his own for two years at Harvard, and he wanted to cooperate with Smith to translate Sophocles' "Antigone" into unrhymed English verse.

He also said in his letter, "I am now writing Luke Havergal, and this is not a joke." Later, this poem became his masterpiece.

We hope to discover more of Robinson's manuscripts, and we also hope to find his short stories that could not be sold. Only when there is more material can we write a detailed study of his biography and poetry.

This old collection of letters was edited by Denham Sutcliffe. The book title is very special, called "Untriangulated Stars." We hope to forget this strange book title.

Free Talk

### University Faculty and Staff

â€” Yijun

Let me tell you a little about the situation of professors and staff in universities. Professors are poor and busy, while staff, in addition to being poor and busy, are also considered cheap.

A few days ago, a few professors received their salaries, and each of them carried a large bundle of banknotes, and smiled bitterly at each other: "Forty dollars." Listening to their calculation: "Before the war, a sesame cake cost one cent. Now, ten thousand yuan can only buy two sesame cakes, which is equivalent to two cents at that time. A salary of twenty million yuan is exactly equal to forty yuan. This is only in terms of eating. If we talk about the standard of clothing, it is less than forty yuan!" With such poor treatment, how can they not be poor? Some poor professors have poor nutrition, are mentally weak, and are not well-dressed. They don't look like professors at all.

Because of poverty, they have to be busy. Being busy helps alleviate poverty, so they can avoid starving to death. How are they busy? The most common situations are two types: one is that because they can't afford a nanny, they are busy holding their children, buying groceries, cooking, and even emptying chamber pots. I have personally seen a professor teach four classes in a row in the morning, and when he came back, he had to start the fire to cook. The second is that they teach part-time at other schools. It is common for one person to teach at three or four schools. The head of my department not only teaches part-time at other schools, but also serves as the head of the department there. Professors are so busy and exhausted that, even if they don't "mislead students," it will at least have an impact on them. As a result of being tired and running around, some treat teaching as "just going through the motions."

Because professors have too much daily mobility, when students have questions that they want to ask or discuss with the professor, they often "wear out iron shoes without finding a place." Even if they are lucky enough to find him, he may not welcome you, because he needs to rest. Some professors teach at so many schools that they can only come two or three times a week, plus sick leave and personal leave, the chances of meeting them are even fewer. Once we see him coming to class, we can't help but feel "what wind blew you here."

Professors in foreign universities are often scientists, inventors, or writers. They are educators, not just "non-stop" teachers. Compared to them, we are really incomparable.

I have expressed my concern about professors being so poor and busy. Now I want to talk about the staff, who are poor, busy, and also "cheap." Although professors are poor and busy, they are still respected by people, and the school authorities treat them with the courtesy of honored guests, and can allocate several rooms for them to live in. But what about the staff? They are treated like discarded shoes. They cannot do anything without official documents, they cannot speak without official jargon, they bury their heads in hard work, and they must also swallow their anger. It is said that in the past, a school, in order to correct this phenomenon of discrimination against staff, reversed the habitual order of faculty and staff in their titles, calling them "staff faculty." The intention was good, but if it is only about reversing the order of one or two words, it is ultimately treating the symptom and not the cause.

However, in any case, these are just minor issues. The big problem is still poverty. The faculty and staff in universities are really too poor.

Because I am a poor student, I cannot help but "sympathize with fellow sufferers."

### Squeezed Out Articles

â€” Zhong Xiuda

The "squeeze" discussed here is not the same in nature as Mr. Lu Xun's "push" and "kick," but a practical issue in writing.

I vaguely remember that a few days ago, a gentleman wrote an article in this magazine entitled "Talking About Not Being Able to Write." At that time, I only read it very hastily. That gentleman probably advocated that writing should be "according to one's feelings." When there is nothing to write, one should simply not write, not force it, and not exhaust it. This statement, of course, has its reasons, because works that are forced out are often mediocre. In order to avoid making readers dislike them, it is better not to write. This is a very pure view, and it is the attitude that scholars should have. However, it is not entirely necessary to say that in order to avoid one's works being "mediocre" or having a "pretentious" air, one must "accord with one's feelings." Writing good articles usually requires inspiration. Works written when one is inspired are always better than those written without inspiration. This is a fact that we cannot deny. However, inspiration does not last forever, and there is no simple method available for artificial creation. If one must "accord with one's feelings" and wait for inspiration, how painful is that? And what if one is writing an article and has not had inspiration or a good mood for a long time?

In terms of quality, I think one can still write some good works even without inspiration. Mr. Lu Xun said that most of his articles were "squeezed" out through painstaking effort in ordinary times. Now when we read his works, we do not feel that they are mediocre or pretentious at all, and they are simply worthy of being called "good." Therefore, I believe that the quality of a work does not depend entirely on whether there is inspiration, but more importantly on the author's attitude when writing.

This is "squeezing." This laborious and nerve-wracking thing is, of course, a painful thing. However, strangely, some people cannot even get the opportunity to "squeeze." A few days ago, I heard Mr. Xu Qinwen describe with frustration his writing situation in recent years. He said that as long as he has two or three hours of free time, he can "squeeze" out something, but due to the pressure of life, he cannot write, let alone think about writing a good work. It can be seen that in today's society, "squeezing" is not a right that everyone has.

### Autumn Thoughts in Chongqing

â€” Bi Xun

Endless west wind blowing on the water, the sound of the tide and the shadows of sails remind me of past travels. In the cool drizzle, swallows fly in pairs, cutting through the clear river, a flute sounds with autumn.

I brew new tea over a live fire, and the lamp shines in the small building, keeping each other company. The white reeds glow on the river, and the green maple trees are old. My dreams revolve around my fifty-stringed zither.

The Jialing River is filled with bamboo branch songs, people come and go, singing "What to do?" Leaning on the railing, I listen to the night rain. The courtyard of phoenix trees gets more of the autumn.

Returning from the hunt, the moon is full in the camp. In the dragon river tiger tent, we talk about military affairs at night. An old scholar still has heroic ambitions, riding alone in the autumn wind, with ten thousand miles of feelings.

Sparse willows on the stone bridge reflect the slanting river, the flowing water and roosting crows sob in the evening smoke. Ten thousand points of new sorrow have nowhere to settle, a fishing fire hangs like a star across the river.

A lonely lamp in the small courtyard is afraid of the return of autumn. How many times have the yellow flowers on the path bloomed? After counting the returning geese, I cannot sleep. Deep in the night, there is still the call of the partridge!

### Veteran Members of This Newspaper in the Past

â€” Zheng Yimei

In the late Qing Dynasty, this newspaper had a flourishing talent pool. As far as I know, there was Wang Ziquan, known as the Hermit of the Southern Sky. He was from Changzhou and liked to travel. His business card had titles such as "Resident of Europe and the West, Poet of the Eastern Waves, Hermit of the Southern Sky, and Recluse of Songbei." The title of "Recluse of Songbei" meant that he was registered with this newspaper and lived in Shanghai. He, Qian Xinbo, known as the Guest Viewing Flowers in the Mist, and He Guisheng, known as the Cold Food Scholar of Gaochang, were known as the Three Talents of this newspaper at the time. Xinbo was skilled in poetry, lyrics, and parallel prose, but his eyesight was poor. He could not see distant objects clearly, hence the name "Guest Viewing Flowers in the Mist." Guisheng was well-versed in classical learning, and many people followed him, such as Gao Taichi and Zhou Pinjiao, who were the most prominent. Guisheng then ordered Taichi and Pinjiao to assist in managing the editing affairs of this newspaper. Taichi once formed the Xishe society with various poets and lyricists and served as its chief. Pinshan was from Anhui, with the alias "The Sick Lyricist," and he took a concubine named Erbao, so he also called himself the Master of the Yunshi Building. Later, he left this newspaper and took charge of the Xiaoxianlu section of the Tongwen Shanghai News. Huang Shiquan of Puzuo, with the alias Master of the Wanxiangliumengshi Studio, also known as Mengwansheng, excelled in parallel prose, which was elegant and magnificent, and could be called unique. He took over the overall management of this newspaper after He Guisheng. He often visited the opera houses and wrote the Pink Ink Collection of Talks in the newspaper, which was later published as a single volume, paving the way for opera commentary. Cai Zihao, known as the Fairy Historian of Lvxin, from Shanghai, whose personal name was Erkang. I have a business card of his, which lists his title as Deputy Editor of the Shen Bao, indicating that Cai was also a former member of this newspaper. In addition, there was Yuan Xiangfu, known as the Old Master of Cangshan, the grandson of Jianzhai, who, when he took charge of this newspaper, built the Yangliuloutai near the Hu family residence on Fuzhou Road, planting rows of willows in front of the door, with green strands fluttering, which gave a refreshing mood. Xiangfu often drank and chanted poetry with his friends there, almost unaware of the disturbances in the world. Most interesting was Zhu Zimei of Qicheng, whose personal name was Changding. He was a top student at the Longmen Academy. His writing style was unrestrained and commendable. The director of this newspaper admired him and hired him to write essays. His essays were voluminous and often hit the mark, which were deeply welcomed by readers. The senior Shanghai Shushisheng was close to him and once said that Zimei stayed at the newspaper office and liked to stroll the streets every night. When he returned, he would buy food and put it in his sleeves. When he was in high spirits, he would chew on it along the way, which was his habit. One cold night, he bought frozen pork trotters, wrapped them in dry lotus leaves, and still hid them in his sleeves on his way home. On the way, he tasted a piece of it. Unexpectedly, a foreign mastiff happened to be nearby, smelled the meat, and pounced on him, almost biting his hand. Zimei was frightened and at a loss, and the remaining meat fell to the ground from his sleeves. He could only let the mastiff eat its fill, stomping his feet and shouting in vain. His colleagues in the office knew about it and used it as a laughing stock. Also, Han Ziyi, known as Han Tai Xian, was from Rongcheng. He worked for this newspaper for many years and gained experience in pleasure trips. He wrote a book called Spring and Autumn Annals of the Land of Flowers. Just as Cao Xueqin used Beijing dialect to write Dream of the Red Chamber, this book used the soft language of Wu. After it was completed, it was published under the name The Biography of Flowers on the Sea. When it was reprinted, Hu Shi even wrote a preface for it. There was also Yang Naiwu, who was involved in the Xiaobaicai case. It was said that after he was acquitted and released from prison, he joined this newspaper as an editor. However, it is not clear whether this is true or not. (Editor's note: Yang Naiwu once served as a correspondent for this newspaper in Shaoxing.)

### Pigeon Peak

â€” Qian Dacheng

On the western end of Mount Lu, there is a peak called Pigeon Peak. Below it lies Jin Peak Villa, also known as Bottle Lodge, with its back against the green mountains and the evening glow like rosy clouds. Facing Shang Lake, spring always lingers with fragrance. It was the place of seclusion after the dismissal of Grand Secretary Weng Changshu of the former Qing Dynasty. Therefore, he was later buried here. In front of his tomb stood nine large characters written by Weng himself: "Tomb of Weng Tongsu, Dismissed Minister." It was not until the reign of Emperor Xuantong, after his rehabilitation and posthumous title were granted, that his remains were moved to the Weng family ancestral hall.

After Weng's dismissal, the Qing court ordered local officials in Yanzhou to supervise him strictly. Therefore, on the first and fifteenth of each month, Weng would walk to the county yamen of Changshu and Zhaowen to see the county magistrates, being respectful and sincere, as if facing a sovereign. However, the local officials felt very uneasy towards him.

Weng once walked from Pigeon Peak to the city. He wrote a poem saying: "A sail accompanies me along the mountain, the rolling Yangtze River's anger is not calmed; tell the dragons not to cause trouble, for I am accustomed to hearing the sound of angry waves." The meaning is profound, and the underlying message undoubtedly contains condemnation for the treacherous officials in the court.

When Weng lived in the village, he never mentioned his official career. If someone mentioned matters of the court, he would show anger on his face. He also did not associate with high-ranking officials, only maintaining close relationships with his nephew, Yu Jinmen, a licentiate, and Wu Honglun, a promising scholar. Despite the distance between the town and the countryside, their correspondence never ceased. He would treat visiting scholars in plain clothing with courteous words. If a woodcutter asked him to paint, he would gladly pick up the brush. However, if a high official sought an ink treasure, he would ignore it for years or have Zhao Guni paint in his stead. Yet, when ordering dishes from the Jinfangyuan Restaurant in the city, he would write the order himself. The restaurant staff knew to treasure these, and over the years, they accumulated a stack of them, which they would show to others, who would all admire them.

As Weng was dying, he showed a farewell poem to his family, saying: "In sixty years of life, bitterness reached the coffin's lid. I will not shed two lines of tears lightly for you all." Aç‹€å…ƒ (top scholar) and prime minister is what people envy. Yet, he felt his life was bleak. Those who seek prominence in the world should take heed.

In the early years of the Republic of China, Kang Youwei and Chen Sanli came to pay respects at his tomb, generously rewarding the tomb keeper. Youwei claimed that Weng had recommended him to Emperor Dezong of the Qing Dynasty, saying that his talent surpassed his own tenfold. However, when asked if this was in Weng's diary, it was not found. Yu Jinmen repeatedly denied that such a thing had occurred, and also said that Weng had strongly advised Jinmen not to associate with Youwei, calling him a person of ill intent. Whether this is true or false, it should be a matter for those researching the Qing history to investigate and verify.

### Little Raindrops

â€” Shi Jimei

The rooster crows in the fields, every dawn, for everyone who hears it at dawn.

Life is suffering, it is an adventure, so life is a battle.

Don't worry about "yesterday," isn't "today" enough for you to cry and laugh?

Talent is the sublimation of emotion.

Dreams are the sublimation of inspiration.

A leaking house is still a house; but once it collapses, it is no longer a house.

If you have a little light in your heart, what is the difference between a lily in the field and Solomon's glory?

### The National Games Ruin People

â€” Hongxian

Lodging with relatives was never a long-term solution, so out of desperation, I pawned off some of my less essential belongings and found a shack in Jiangæ¹¾ to live in. After paying a relatively low rent for a month, I felt much lighter.

Who knew that the National Games being held in Jiangæ¹¾ would cause the price of shacks near the Games venue to increase tenfold instantly, and rent was now collected daily. It was said that the daily rent was one to two million yuan. If one rented for half a month, they could earn tens of millions. Unfortunately, my rented room was near the venue, and the landlord was also the kind of person who only cared about money. For the sake of his windfall fortune, he did not hesitate to "arm" his words and issue an eviction notice.

I couldn't blame him, because that's just how reality is. In order to discuss new renting terms later, I unconditionally gave in and had to move back to my relative's house. I had to take the moving costs there and back as my own bad luck. From this, one can see that it is difficult to live in Shanghai, and even the suburban towns are no exception.
