### Thirty-Eighth Year Administrative Policy: Executive Yuan Passes Three Principles: Suppress Bandit Rebellions, Increase Production, Stabilize Social Order; Grain Rationing for Public School Teachers in Five Cities Changed to Cash Payments

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 29th] The government's administrative policy for the thirty-eighth year has been submitted for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting held on the morning of the 29th, and two principles have been decided: (1) Suppress bandit rebellions, (2) Increase production, (3) Stabilize social order. Each ministry and commission will then formulate specific policies. It is also learned that the important cases passed by the Executive Yuan meeting today include the following: 1. The Ministry of Transportation's request for funds for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway project was approved and allocated, with a deadline of three years for completion. 2. Measures for aiding self-funded students studying abroad were approved. 3. The distribution of three dou of grain to public school teachers in the five major cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Guangzhou will be changed to a cash payment in lieu of rice, and the original grain distribution will be discontinued.

### Stuart Little Leaves the United States to Return to China, Explaining the Responsibilities of Each Company Under the Industrial Fittings Plan; Must Complete Work with the Lowest Cost and Shortest Time

[Dispatch from the Economic Cooperation Administration in this city] The responsibilities of each project engineering company under the Economic Cooperation Administration's $35 million aid to China industrial fittings plan were solemnly stated on the 29th from Washington.

Stuart Little, head of the Economic Cooperation Administration's Technical Investigation Team, announced at a press conference: "The engineering companies hired by the beneficiaries of this plan must execute each project at the lowest cost and in the shortest possible time." After the meeting, Mr. Stuart Little left Washington for Shanghai and will arrive here early next week.

As of today, 14 engineering projects totaling $22.5 million have been provisionally approved under the fittings program. The above program is part of the $275 million total American aid implemented by Mr. Lapham.

The selection of all engineering projects aims to provide the greatest benefit to China's industrial economy. Its smooth progress will greatly increase the need for work in China's major textile, sugar, electricity, and railway enterprises and related industries.

Mr. Stuart Little stressed that only experienced engineering companies will be employed in this plan, which can speed up the project and achieve high efficiency.

Among the enterprises currently receiving assistance, the Jibei Electric Power Company, the Yangzi Electric Power Company, the Kailuan Coal Mine, and the Taiwan Jingye Corporation have already selected their engineers. According to Mr. Stuart Little, the other ten enterprises have been urged to appoint them as soon as possible. Mr. Stuart Little also said: "In contacting the engineering business of various enterprises, each engineering company can enjoy equal opportunities, such as the Taiwan Railway Company."

Engineering companies should receive reasonable remuneration for their services, but the calculation method is not based on a certain percentage, because the nature and quantity of various tasks are not the same in terms of currency value.

Mr. Stuart Little also said: "Under the procedure of the Economic Cooperation Administration, the relationship between each engineering company and enterprise is professional in nature. The engineering company must represent each enterprise in procuring fittings with the most favorable prices and delivery terms all over the world, and will do its best to obtain competitive prices."

In order to save time and money, and to assist other countries engaged in reconstruction plans, all materials used in this plan will be procured not only in the United States, but also in other countries under the Wuxieer Plan and in Japan. In addition, the remaining materials stored by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's Property Custody Committee, the Materials Supply Bureau, and other agencies will also be utilized. This method can save part of the expenditure in US dollars and extend the execution time of the plan.

Observers in Washington call this plan a "new approach." In order to maximize its efficiency in execution, each project engineer must sign a service pledge and be countersigned by the executor of the plan, certifying the following points: (1) Based on appropriate technical investigation, this plan should produce the intended effect. (2) Comprehensive investigations have been conducted in procurement to ensure the most favorable prices and delivery terms. (3) The engineering company must submit a specification guaranteeing that materials will be procured and equipment installed in the fastest and most economical manner. (4) Progress reports must be submitted at any time as required.

Mr. Stuart Little also said: "When the project engineers submit a draft of the above-mentioned pledge, they must discuss the relevant remuneration, material procurement methods, and competitive quotations with the technical team. If necessary, material reports will be held in sealed quotations."

The above-mentioned technical country will be represented by a special engineering company hired by the Chinese government. The task of the company will be to serve as a consultant and supervising engineer for the Sino-American Industrial Construction and Fittings Joint Committee under American Aid.

### Editorial: A Critique of Zhang Qun's "Impressions of Japan"

Former Premier Zhang Qun, after returning from an inspection tour of Japan, compiled his findings and broadcast them to the nation on the evening of the 28th of this month. The full text was published in this newspaper yesterday. This speech is more important than the "Message to the Japanese People" he delivered in Japan. It painstakingly presents his observations during his three weeks in Japan and expresses considerable satisfaction. It concludes with a call for an Asian century, with both appeals and expectations. At a time when the United Nations General Assembly is being held in Paris and the concept of regional security is gaining widespread support, Zhang Qun's "Impressions of Japan" undoubtedly carries profound significance and will have a far-reaching impact on Asia.

The content of this speech includes observations from many perspectives. Regarding his view of Japan, he expressed considerable satisfaction with Japan under MacArthur's control. He explained that under this control, Japan's military has been dismantled, and its police force is very weak. The Maritime Safety Agency only has vessels to prevent smuggling and no armed forces. Therefore, he is certain that Japan cannot rebuild a national defense force sufficient to cope with the next major war. Politically, the new Japanese constitution limits the power of the Emperor, and the symbolic Emperor cannot become a god. The Allied forces have completely separated politics and religion. In particular, MacArthur's support for "centrist politics" and the purging of remnants of militarism lead him to believe that "Japanese-style theocratic fascist politics will not easily rise again." However, Zhang said, "Establishing a democratic system is relatively easy, but cultivating a democratic mindset and a democratic way of life is still difficult." Economically, he believes that Japan's current economic situation is far from self-sufficiency, let alone economic recovery. He cited the dissolution of the zaibatsu and the implementation of land reform, with 40% of the materials imported under the five-year plan coming from Asia and 50% from the dollar area. Therefore, he concludes, "Japan cannot re-establish a militaristic regime threatening peace based on its economic conditions, and the key lies in our hands in China." Finally, he pointed out that the construction of the world in the future will center on Asia, and the Asian century has already begun. Our handling of the Japan issue should not only be passively non-retaliatory but also actively constructive. How should we be constructive? Summarizing Zhang's views, there are the following points: (1) We should abandon passive and unhelpful suspicions towards Japan, and China should establish a proactive policy towards Japan; (2) From the perspective of the overall interests of Asian nations and the permanent relationship between China and Japan, we should take far-sighted measures to promote the convening of a peace conference with Japan; (3) We must ensure that Asian nations jointly obtain freedom from want before we can truly obtain freedom from fear. The Japan issue is an Asian issue, and considering and handling the Japan issue within the context of the entire Asian issue will naturally lead to correct solutions to all historical grievances and post-war anxieties.

We are not entirely in agreement with Zhang's speech and its premature conclusions on the current situation in Japan. However, we admire his thoughtful and far-sighted view of the future of Asia. We would like to express our views and discuss them with Zhang and the nation:

First, Zhang Qun's visit to Japan lasted three weeks, and he must have gathered a great deal of information. Zhang's assertion that Japan under MacArthur's control is virtually free of causes for suspicion and fear in terms of military affairs, politics, and economics is overly optimistic. First of all, Japan's economic recovery is a fact. If this recovery is not carried out under the joint supervision and control of the Allied nations, it could become a prelude to the revival of militarism. This is the general view of Allied politicians. More than 40% of the raw materials imported under Japan's economic plan come from Asia, with a large portion of the raw material supply sought from China, and a large portion of its manufactured goods are marketed in China. This is still the old path of "industrial Japan, agricultural China." In particular, the current stage of Japanese politics has not thoroughly achieved "ideological revolution" and "psychological construction." In other words, political democratization and economic democratization have not taken root from the ground up. Therefore, we cannot readily believe that Japan's economic recovery will not threaten China. In order to thoroughly clarify the Japan issue, we agree to convene a peace conference with Japan as soon as possible, conclude a peace treaty with Japan in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration and the Far Eastern Commission's resolutions, and truly promote the democratization of the Japanese economy under the supervision of the Allied nations in order to achieve political democratization. The current stage of Japanese politics is still far from the path of true democratization.

Second, Zhang's point that the center of the world is in Asia is the most accurate view. Nehru made the same call on India's Independence Day, which was deeply valued by the people of Asia. Asia occupies one-third of the Earth's land area, has one-half of the world's population, covering 18 million square miles, and with 1.3 billion people. Europeans and Americans say that the era of humanity has moved from Babylon and Egypt to Rome, and now it has returned to Asia. The current world is caught in a bipolar struggle, but the true thinking and path for humanity are not in the two poles. As the ancients said, "Truth is not in this extreme or that extreme, but in the middle of the two extremes." The Asian century is the century in the middle of the two extremes. It is sublimated from thousands of years of thought and historical experience and has a highly enlightened and moderate philosophical foundation. We sympathize with Zhang's far-sighted call and hope that, with our country as the center, we can hold an Asian international conference with Asian countries, especially the newly emerging ones, to establish pan-Asian peace and economic prosperity. Nehru once said: Asia cannot abandon Japan, and it is unwise to completely suppress the Japanese nation. We believe that after a thorough ideological revolution, Japan should be led onto a path of true peace and brightness.

In summary, solving the Japan issue from the perspective of the overall interests of Asia is the correct approach. However, we should not have excessive expectations for the current situation in Japan. Because the peace conference has not been held, the peace treaty has not been signed, and the new Japan of common ideals of the Allied nations has not yet appeared, we cannot be too optimistic about the Japan issue.

### Japanese Strictly Restricting Economic Activities of Overseas Chinese; Liu Qiguang Gives Talk Upon Return to Taiwan from Japan

[Report from our Taipei office on the 29th] Liu Qiguang, chairman of the Taiwan Hua Nan Bank, who went to Japan as a representative of the trade delegation to Japan, has now returned to Taiwan. He told reporters that this trip yielded no results in terms of trade. The previous rumor of a 200 million yen transaction with Japan is completely unfounded, and it is unlikely that formal trade relations with Japan will occur in the future. The problem is that the materials we are allowed to export are not needed by Japan, and the materials we hope to obtain are prohibited from export by Japan. However, the time spent in Japan allowed for a very detailed and accurate observation of the state of Japanese society and the situation of overseas Chinese after the war. The total number of overseas Chinese currently in Japan is only 29,000, with Taiwanese accounting for slightly more than half. The Japanese estimate their assets to be as high as 30 to 50 billion yen, so Japanese society is very concerned and uneasy about the financial power of overseas Chinese and strictly restricts their economic activities. Actual statistics show that the total value of overseas Chinese assets is no more than 2 billion yen, so it remains to be studied whether the Japanese estimate is deliberately exaggerated. The situation in Japanese society is worse than imagined. The people's lives are difficult. Taking food as an example, each person only receives enough rationed rice for ten days a month, and they must find ways to supplement with coarse grains for the remaining twenty days. Other issues such as clothing and housing shortages are also very serious. The exhaustion of industrial and commercial economy is particularly dire and will not recover in the short term. As for the reported Taiwanese independence movement with underground organizations in Japan, the Taiwanese residing in Japan are unaware of it, nor have they heard of such activities. Only Suzuki Yukio's World Daily News published this news on August 24th and September 23rd with large-character headlines. After inquiry, it was said that it was based on leaflets. However, it should be noted that the Taiwanese residing in Japan are very ignorant of the current situation in Taiwan. They believe that the current situation in Taiwan is even worse than in Japan, which needs to be clarified.

### Allocation of Japanese Reparation Machines; Temporarily Calculated at Half Price; Half a Month Deadline for Payment

[Report from our Nanjing office on the 29th] The prices of Japanese reparation machines allocated to private enterprises as approved by the Allied Headquarters are very high. The Executive Yuan has recently decided that a temporary payment of 50% should be calculated and paid first, and adjustments will be made after the Cooperative Council determines the final price. According to the law, private enterprises purchasing Japanese reparations goods should pay at the statutory exchange rate of 4 gold yuan per US dollar. The payment deadline was also agreed to be September 15th of this year. However, recently, factories such as the Xinmin Machinery Factory have requested that the prices be re-set. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided on two measures through consultation: one is to cooperate with the currency system reform and take the price of August 19th as the standard. The reparations machine tools will be temporarily calculated and paid at 65% of the price approved by the Allied Headquarters, and adjustments will be made after the Cooperative Council determines the final price. The second is the method passed today, which calculates at 50%. The former applies to domestic situations, while the latter applies to international situations. At the same time, in order to have a basis for proposing price reductions at the peace conference in the future, the latter standard should be preferred. The payment deadline will be half a month from the date of promulgation of this measure. Factories and mines in remote areas or with special circumstances may be granted an extension, but it should not exceed one month.

Considering the repeated exchange of documents and negotiations between the three governments and the Soviet Union, the three governments are deeply aware of their obligation to resolve disputes by peaceful means under the provisions of the Charter and have made every effort to negotiate directly with the Soviet Union to eliminate the gaps between the three countries and the Soviet Union. The dispute between the Soviet government and the Western powers is not a matter of logistical difficulties in transportation, nor is it an agreement on the conditions for managing the currency in Berlin. The dispute lies in the fact that the Soviet government has clearly expressed through its actions that it is unwilling to fulfill its obligations and attempts to achieve political goals that it should not have and cannot achieve through peaceful means by illegal and coercive means. The country has used blockade methods to threaten the residents of Berlin with starvation and economic collapse, watch the occurrence of riots, and attempt to overthrow the legally elected Berlin Municipal Government. The attitude and behavior of the Soviet government extremely demonstrate its intention to continue to implement illegal and coercive blockades and to use its illegal actions to reduce the position of the United States, France, and Britain from occupying powers in Berlin to a state of complete submission to Soviet power, thereby obtaining absolute power to control the economic, political, and social lives of the residents of Berlin and incorporating the city of Berlin into the Soviet occupation zone. The Soviet government has thus created a situation in which it is no longer possible to seek solutions under Article 33 of the United Nations Charter under the current circumstances and has constituted a threat to world peace and security, for which the Soviet government should be solely responsible. In order to prevent the world peace and security from being jeopardized again, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, in addition to reserving the full right to take necessary measures to maintain their position in Berlin, have no choice but to submit the actions of the Soviet government to the United Nations Security Council so that the Security Council can consider this issue as soon as possible."

### In Handling the Berlin Issue Dispute; China's Attitude is Pivotal; Foreign Minister Wang is Carefully Reviewing

[Central News Agency, Paris, 28th] A reporter learned today from sources close to the Chinese delegation that China is giving careful consideration to its position on the Berlin issue and will express its position when the issue is submitted to the Security Council. Because China is currently one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, China's position is of great importance. According to Chapter 6 of the United Nations Charter, which will be cited regarding the Berlin issue, China is the only one of the five powers that is not a party to the dispute and has the right to use the veto power, while Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union cannot participate in the vote.

Wang Shijie, the head of the Chinese delegation, convened a meeting of all representatives and advisors this morning. At the meeting, a thorough discussion was held on the political and procedural issues related to the Berlin situation. China's position on this issue was also reviewed. However, the Chinese delegation believes that submitting the Berlin issue to the Security Council will involve many technical difficulties.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 28th] The Security Council failed to achieve anything today in dealing with the Hyderabad dispute, as some representatives expressed doubt over whether the notification of the withdrawal of the case by the Prince of Hyderabad was valid. Our representative, Jiang Tingfu, made a carefully worded defense, saying: We all agree that the notification of the Prince of Hyderabad was personally signed, so there should be no doubt. Other representatives said: The Prince's withdrawal of the case may have been due to pressure from India.

### Yugoslav Representative Criticizes the United States; In Cahoots with the Soviet Union

[United Press, Paris, 29th] Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj took the floor, strongly supporting the Soviet Union and accusing the West of attempting to undermine the United Nations. Kardelj is the right-hand man of Yugoslav dictator Tito. Although Tito had been expelled by the Cominform, he adhered to the Soviet line of attacking the West and urged the General Assembly to adopt the Soviet disarmament proposal. There was no hint in Kardelj's words that Stalin and Tito had fallen out. He praised the Soviet Union and its communist system as the world's first and greatest hope, but this flattering praise was long gone from the Soviet Union. His remarks did not move Western diplomats, as Yugoslavia is secretly in conflict with the Soviet Union behind the scenes, but on the surface remains in cahoots with the Soviet Union. Kardelj made the following points in accusing the United States: (1) creating and developing West Germany as a military and economic base for the United States in Western Europe; (2) stationing troops in Allied and other countries; (3) "inciting chaos" in the Near East; (4) "rebuilding Japan as an anti-Soviet base"; (5) not fulfilling peace treaties; (6) organizing a vast military base system; (7) refusing to disarm and ban atomic bombs.

Manuilsky also accused British Foreign Secretary Bevin of "waving an atomic bomb at the Soviet Union on this podium." He accused the United States of owning 489 military bases to rule the world. However, his words were mainly aimed at refuting Bevin and Belgian representative Spaak, whom he called "trying to frighten their own people. The Western countries are waving flags and shouting in fear here so that their real plans can hide behind this smoke screen, which is to launch a war against the Soviet and Eastern European democratic countries." After Manuilsky finished his speech, the debate in the General Assembly this morning ended at 11:45, and the General Assembly adjourned temporarily, waiting for notice to reconvene.

### Dewey Pays Close Attention to the Development of the Berlin Issue; He Believes That the United States Cannot Compromise in Principle

[United Press, Missoula, Montana, 28th] Republican presidential candidate Dewey declared on the 28th that the United States "will not change our principles" in seeking a peaceful resolution to the Berlin crisis. He said, "An ominous threat hangs over the future of the United States, but people must not give up hope for a peaceful resolution." Dewey is in constant contact with the negotiations in Paris on the Berlin issue through US representative Dulles. He said, "Cruel aggression aimed at enslaving mankind is spreading widely around the world. In Berlin, where we have the right to stay under the sacred agreement, we are facing this aggressive country head-on. In the United Nations General Assembly in Paris, our representatives are working side by side with representatives of other free countries to confront the vast superiority, so that even in the last hour, a peaceful resolution can be reached. In the spirit of national unity, we stand side by side with them. We will not compromise on our principles. There is no peace in compromise, and we will not cease our efforts to seek a common basis for agreement, or stop praying for a fair and peaceful solution." Dewey added that it is a tragedy that the country, three years after the end of the war, is still unable to devote all its efforts to developing its resources and achieving economic progress.

At the time, President Truman, U.S. Treasury Secretary Snyder, and others expressed their views on the financial problems of various groups in the world.

Chairman Wang Yunwu told the representatives of 47 countries that the world's economic recovery had achieved "noteworthy progress." However, he also said that this progress was still too slow and limited, and not sufficient to compensate for wartime losses and meet the needs of the current emergency situation. Wang further stated that the budgets of many countries are still extremely difficult to cope with international payment deficits, forcing many countries to continue to draw heavily on already greatly reduced US dollar funds. Wang said that without US foreign aid, many representatives attending the current meeting would have to launch fierce struggles for the economic survival of their respective countries, and would not be able to come together as they are now to cooperate in devising ways for a more prosperous and stable world economy. He said: "The existence of the European Recovery Program gives us confidence in the future. The recent actions of the United States guarantee that the construction work of the West will move forward, and the success of the recovery is close to becoming a foregone conclusion." Wang forcefully stated that external assistance is needed for the reconstruction of war-torn areas in the Far East and for the further industrialization of industrially backward areas. He said that in implementing these plans, the economic welfare of the entire world must be the premise.

### Situation in Berlin Remains Tense; East and West Occupation Zones Hasten to Build Aircraft; Three Powers Consider Evacuating West Berlin Residents

[French News Agency, Washington, 28th] Military sources here stated: The authorities in West Berlin are actively rushing to build two new airports, with 17,000 German workers working in shifts around the clock, striving to complete them within the next week. These two new airports can greatly increase the capacity to accommodate large transport aircraft, and the amount of airport construction materials is astonishing.

### Communist Parties in Asia Are Gradually Growing Stronger; Implies That They May Succeed; Seize Every Opportunity and Utilize It

[United Press Agency, Washington, 28th] "U.S. News & World Report" published on the 28th that the growth of the Communist Party in Asia in the past six months "implies that the Communist Party in Asia is gradually becoming more likely to succeed, not in the next year or the year after, but within five to ten years." This estimate is based on a trip to Asia by the magazine's reporter, Mr. Fromm. Mr. Fromm reported that after conducting on-the-ground inspections of the situations in Japan, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Burma, and India, it shows that the United States and Western countries are failing in the "Cold War" in Asia due to negligence. The main factor in the strengthening of the Communist Party is that the United States and other Western powers cannot formulate a positive policy towards the East. It is still questionable whether the Asian International Communist Intelligence Bureau, which aims to unite these and other Communist Party actions, currently exists. The Soviet Union is now coordinating with national movements, seizing every opportunity to use them, causing Asia's attitude towards the United States to become increasingly disappointed."

### Textile and Construction's First Retail Department; Entrusted to Retail Woolen Fabrics; Total Number is 3 Million Yards; Supply is Not Lacking

Selling Price Per Yard Starts From 2 Yuan and 2 Jiao

[Report from this newspaper] A spokesperson for the Custody Committee of the Executive Yuan's Post-War Enterprise Committee made the following statement to this newspaper's reporter yesterday regarding the committee's entrustment of the China Textile and Construction Company's First Retail Department to supply and sell woolen fabrics: The total number of this batch of woolen fabrics is approximately 3 million yards, most of which come from Australia, and were transferred to the committee for safekeeping after the end of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. During the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration period, this batch of woolen fabrics was not suitable for relief purposes, but it was also inconvenient to sell them in large quantities in the market, fearing that it would affect the market price of domestic woolen fabrics, so they were not processed for a long time. After the transfer to the Post-War Custody Committee, it was recently decided to entrust the Textile and Construction First Retail Department for retail in order to implement the government's order to allocate materials and absorb floating capital, but the committee still reserves the right to stop selling at any time. There are more than 20 types of this batch of woolen fabrics, with various colors available, but women's woolen fabrics account for the majority, and there are also many men's overcoat woolen fabrics.

Six Yards Cut Into One Section

Currently, women's woolen fabrics are supplied first, with prices ranging from 2 yuan and 2 jiao to 2 yuan and 8 jiao per yard. Every six yards are cut into one section, and each person is limited to purchasing one section. Although men's overcoat woolen fabrics have been unpacked, they have not yet been priced, so they are not supplied for the time being. The valuation of the committee is jointly agreed upon by representatives from the city's woolen fabric industry, the Textile and Construction Company, etc., and the valuation is 10% lower than the market price in principle. The proceeds from the sale are collected by the Bank of China as one of the financial sources for the Post-War Custody Committee. He said: Within the daily operating hours of the Textile and Construction Department Store (from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM every day), this batch of woolen fabrics is supplied without restrictions, and the total number is as high as 3 million yards, so there is no need for citizens to crowd together.

Crowded All Day Long

According to Manager Hu of the Textile and Construction Company's First Department Store, the company's department store usually supplies products from the company's various factories, and it already feels overwhelmed. Since the 14th of this month, the Post-War Custody Committee has entrusted the sale of woolen fabrics, which has resulted in crowding all day long. The department store's sales staff, totaling only 27 people, feel even more difficult to cope with. It has now invited the company's authorities to approve the addition of eight people to alleviate the urgent situation. It is reported that most of this batch of woolen fabrics are cotton-wool blends, and there are no similar products on the market. Currently, the department store sells an average of about 4,000 yards per day, and can collect 12,000 to 15,000 yuan per day, but because the price is relatively low, the number of sales continues to increase daily.

### Reselling Allotted Rice Discovered; Zhou Yongsheng Rice Shop Punished

The attending representatives forcefully stated the difficulties of the rice industry, saying that Shanghai's limited rice price is lower than that of other ports, so the goods are not smooth. For example, before the limited price, 500 to 600 dan of rice were transported from Zhoupu to Shanghai every day, but now the export is prohibited. The same situation exists in other rice-producing areas. At the time, Wan Molin also provided a written report on the city's rice reserves and other related situations.

Yesterday, he specially sent telegrams to Wang Qiyu, chairman of the Cotton Textile Industry Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai, Huang Jiufeng, chairman of the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, and Tang Zhiliang, chairman of the Yarn Business Association, to commend them and encourage them to continue to uphold their original intentions in the future to promote this effort.

### Wax Statue Exhibition - A Domestic First - To Be Held at the Shandong Guild Hall Starting Tomorrow

Lifelike Sculptures of Historical Figures

[Report from Our Newspaper] Cheng Zhenxia, renowned domestically for her research on Chinese historical clothing and accessories, has recently been invited by the Preparatory Office of the Taishi Art Museum to bring her nearly ten years of work, a total of twenty-two pieces, from Beijing to be displayed and exhibited at the Shandong Guild Hall on Zizhong Road (Ximen Road) starting from the first of next month. A wax statue exhibition of clothing and accessories is a domestic first and is undoubtedly of value in modern cultural relics and art research. These wax statues of clothing and accessories range from the Han Dynasty to the Republic of China, including Han and Wei Dynasty ladies' attire, Tang Dynasty shawls, Tang Dynasty Hu (non-Han Chinese) clothing, Song Dynasty formal women's wear, Yuan Dynasty "Gugu" hats, late Ming Dynasty women's everyday wear, Ming Dynasty scholar-official attire, Ming Dynasty children's clothing, Ming Dynasty old woman's attire, Ming Dynasty maid's attire, Imperial concubine embroidering a tiger, Qing Dynasty civil officials, Qing Dynasty military generals, Empress Dowager Cixi's longevity fairy robes, Qing Dynasty palace maids, Imperial Prince's auspicious robes, Imperial Consort, Mongolian young chieftain, Republic of China sacrificial robes, Wu Xun (a famous educator), and Republic of China women's formal wear, totaling twenty-two pieces, all displayed separately in different rooms. All the wax statues and clothing accessories have been meticulously researched and substantiated from historical records by the author, taking more than a year to complete each perfect model. The wax statues have vivid facial expressions, resembling real people. For example, the room displaying the Imperial concubine embroidering a tiger is further equipped with a wedding backdrop of the imperial palace interior, making people feel as if they are on a historical stage. Among them, Cixi's costumes and the Imperial Prince's auspicious robes were purchased from the Forbidden City, making them particularly valuable. Wax statue making originated in England and France. Cheng studied the production techniques with famous artists during her early years in England. At that time, the Chinese art world lacked a concrete understanding of wax statues. After returning to China, she taught at Yanjing University in Beijing, and devoted herself to studying the historical clothing and accessory system of China, achieving profound accomplishments. The works exhibited this time are the culmination of her decades of comprehensive research.

### Adhere to the Price Limit Policy to the End - Chiang Ching-kuo Vows to Engage in a Long-Term War of Attrition with Profiteers

[Report from Our Newspaper] Chiang Ching-kuo informally hosted a dinner for foreign reporters in the city last night, invited by Zhao Junmai, head of the Fisheries Management Office. More than ten representatives of foreign newspapers and news agencies stationed in Shanghai attended. Director Chiang had important official duties to attend to and was represented by Secretary Gao. In answering various questions, Gao emphasized that Chiang Ching-kuo was determined to implement the price limit policy. According to the experience of price limits in Chongqing during the war, hoarders often forced the government to raise the price limits by concealing materials, which ultimately led to the failure of the price limit policy. Today, Chiang has the determination to adhere to the price limit even if merchants do not supply goods to the market. He believes that after a stalemate of two or three months, the price limit policy will eventually be victorious. For example, if Shanghai has no pork supply due to the price limit, citizens can still live, but if it persists for three months, meat merchants may not be able to withstand it. Chiang has this conviction and is determined to carry out a long-term war of attrition against this organized destructive force. In the month since the implementation of economic controls, Shanghai's prices have remained relatively stable, but prices in other parts of the country have soared, which will affect the control work in this city. To this end, Chiang has specifically requested the central government to formulate measures to stabilize prices in other regions. Director Chiang's work is entirely in accordance with the orders of the Executive Yuan. The rumor that he is acting on his own is completely inaccurate.

### Confiscated Materials at the North Railway Station - Estimated to Reach Thousands of Tons - Sufficient Evidence Required for Retrieval

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to Cheng Yi-kuan, captain of the Economic Inspection Brigade, the materials currently confiscated at the North Railway Station without exit permits are estimated to be around one thousand eight hundred tons. Owners who wish to retrieve them must have sufficient evidence to prove that they are not materials intended to evade regulations. Among these materials, hundreds of tons of unclaimed goods have been found. It is speculated that the owners may have gone to other cities and entrusted transportation companies to transport the goods. When asked about the inspection of private warehouses in the city, Cheng said: There are about two thousand private warehouses in the city. In principle, there is nothing wrong with warehouses storing goods, but it is also necessary to consider their type, quantity, and date to determine whether there are any illegal activities.

### Second Surprise Inspection at the North Railway Station - Thirty-Five Gold Bars Discovered in Opened Suitcase - Female Teacher En Route to Hangzhou Intercepted

Temporarily Held in Custody by the Railway Bureau, to be Accompanied to the National Bank for Exchange Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Police Department of the Railway Bureau launched its second surprise inspection yesterday afternoon, targeting passengers on the Jinling and Qiantang express trains. Under the supervision of Li Ruhe, stationmaster of the inspection station, inspectors boarded the trains in batches, stationed at the ticket entrance, and conducted inspections of passengers on the two trains one by one. At about 2:15 PM, a young woman dressed in a bright red cheongsam and a light yellow short绒 coat, carrying only a small travel suitcase, a radio, and a bunch of bananas, entered the platform with a first-class ticket for the Qiantang express train. Inspectors waiting nearby stepped forward and explained that they were ordered to conduct an inspection. The woman was very calm and accepted the inspection. Railway police, noting that her suitcase was too heavy, requested to open it. The woman immediately produced the key. Upon opening the suitcase, it was shockingly filled with large gold bars, packed in bundles of five, wrapped in kraft paper, totaling thirty-five bars, amounting to three hundred and fifty taels. Inspectors, noting the excessive amount, asked the woman to go to the police department for questioning. According to her statement, her name is Zhou Jian, from Xinyang, Henan, 23 years old, a graduate of the Foreign Languages Department of Beijing Normal University, and formerly the director of education at the elementary school affiliated with the Second Supply Division of the Beijing Air Force. She was recently hired as an English teacher at Zhejiang Provincial Medical College. The gold bars belonged to Zhang Zhicheng, a relative of her sister, Zhou Qihua. Her sister's husband is Wu Qiujian, the current Administrative Inspector of Yuyao. The day before yesterday, she was entrusted by her sister to come to Shanghai from Hangzhou to retrieve the gold bars from safe deposit box No. 6842 at the Bank of China, intending to take them back to Hangzhou to exchange for gold yuan to purchase a house at No. 29 West Main Street in Hangzhou. The owner of the gold, Zhang Zhicheng, is currently residing at the Qingtai Second Hotel in Hangzhou. She does not know Zhang personally, so she does not know other details. The woman stated everything calmly and without reluctance. The Police Department of the Railway Bureau telephoned the Economic Supervision Office for instructions. After being instructed to send the case file to the office for review, the woman insisted on retrieving the gold bars, arguing with them until about 8:00 PM, when she finally agreed to temporarily seal the gold bars in the suitcase, to be temporarily held in custody by the Police Department of the Railway Bureau, and a receipt was issued. This morning, the Police Department dispatched personnel to protect and accompany her to the Central Bank to exchange the gold for gold yuan. The woman left the police department at 8:30 AM to stay at a friend's house, preparing to go to Hangzhou again today.

### Collusion Between Chinese and Japanese Merchants in Smuggling - Court Rules Not Guilty - At the Time of the Defendants' Actions - No Explicit Legal Provision to Punish Tax Evasion

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yoshii Mutsumi, the representative of the Japanese Nakaizumi Sangyo Co. in China, and Sheng Yu, a Chinese merchant, were accused of colluding with each other to evade customs duties. The court pronounced yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM: Yoshii Mutsumi and Sheng Yu were both not guilty. The reasoning for the verdict: the defendants colluded with each other between March and April of the thirty-sixth year of the Republic, raising 120 million yuan and using the name of Zhongmei Industrial Company to transport seafood, fish, needles, etc. from Japan on the Japanese ship "Nissei Maru", concealing them from Chinese customs, smuggling them to Shanghai, and selling them for profit, which constituted a continuous crime of violating Articles 3 and 4 of the Provisional Regulations for Implementing Customs Duty Evasion. It was found that the regulations were extended in September of the thirty-first year of the Republic for a period of one year, and were not extended thereafter, and have long since expired. The current smuggling regulations were promulgated and implemented on March 11 of this year, which was after the defendants' actions. At the time of the defendants' actions, there were no explicit legal provisions to punish customs duty evasion. Apart from administrative penalties imposed by customs in accordance with the anti-smuggling regulations, it is difficult to impose criminal penalties, and therefore a judgment of not guilty is made. In addition, the court passed the following resolutions: (1) Disputes over wages in the printing industry; (2) Disputes over the conversion of wages for bamboo ware fence groups into gold yuan; (3) Disputes over wage discounts in the dyeing and cleaning industry; (4) Issues related to public holidays for union officials, recommending that the central government formulate separate measures; (5) Outline of the work plan for the survey of the status of joint industry employees in this city, etc.

### Obstructing the Execution of Demolishing Shanties - Prosecution of Rickshaw Pullers and Four Others

[Report from Our Newspaper] Dai Weiyan, Zhang Xiaosizi, and Li Dejiang, three rickshaw pullers, previously built shanties illegally on a site at the entrance of Lane 554, Tonghua Road. Xi Miaokun and Fuming Machinery Factory jointly reported them on August 31. After investigation by the Jiangning Road Police Precinct, they were given a police warning and ordered to demolish the shanties themselves within three days. However, Dai et al. did not comply. On September 5, Lou Guifang, a staff member of the precinct, led two police officers to order the demolition. Accidentally, the roof collapsed, injuring a child named Chen Changhua. At this point, Dai et al. took the opportunity to incite more than a hundred shanty dwellers nearby to surround Lou et al. At this time, Dai Bin, who claimed to be a member of a construction brigade, grabbed Lou's uniform and said: "You should be taken to the troops for handling if you are demolishing private houses without permission." Subsequently, someone telephoned the precinct to send police officers, who arrested the four people together and transferred them to the District Procuratorate for investigation. Recently, the investigation was concluded, and the four defendants were prosecuted for obstructing official duties.

### Robber Couldn't Bear to Harm Uncle - Called the Police to Lead the Arrest of Accomplices

[Report from Our Newspaper] Five robbers, Wang Mingting, Jin Quande, Shen Simiao, Xu Manfu, and Ying A San, had previously committed numerous crimes in Ningbo and were unable to gain a foothold. They came to Shanghai one after another last month, staying at the home of Ying A San's uncle at No. 431 Jiangxi Road. Wang Mingcong then moved to his uncle Zhang Yongnian's place at No. 4, Lane 457, Xinzha Road. Jin et al. learned that the Zhang family was wealthy, and once planned to rob them on the 27th, scheduling to go to Zhang Yongnian's home on the night of the 28th to commit robbery. They even called Wang Mingcong to participate and guide them. At this point, Wang was in a dilemma and had to promise them, but when they arrived, he took the opportunity to escape and reported to a volunteer police officer, who reported to the Detective Division of the Municipal Police Department. The Municipal Police Department sent additional police officers, led by Wang Mingting, to No. 431 Jiangxi Road, where they captured all four suspects, Jin Quande, etc., and took them to the bureau for interrogation. After verifying the facts, they were transferred to the District Procuratorate for trial.

### A Small Interlude After the Battle of Rehe - The Release and Pursuit of Prisoners in Chengde City

— Our Newspaper Reporter Xing Ruofeng

[Aeronautical Report from Chengde, 22nd] A case of releasing and pursuing prisoners recently occurred in Chengde. In today's bandit suppression campaign, under martial law, such "temporary measures" are prescribed by law. It should not be considered a strange incident. However, the play "Releasing Prisoners," performed by Emperor Taizong of Tang 1500 years ago, is now being replayed on the stage of the atomic age. Although the times are different and the chaos is completely different, the comical play of the Tang Dynasty has, after thousands of years, once again occurred without a parallel.

When the war in western Rehe broke out on May 11 of this year, martial law was declared by the Pacification Zone Headquarters on the 13th. At that time, the situation of Chengde's all-out war was extremely tenacious with the military and civilians sharing the same hatred. On one hand, a centralized command was used to unify the attack and defense, and on the other hand, a non-combatant population evacuation policy was adopted to reduce food consumption within the city. The Rehe High Court and the Local Court were both preparing to move to Beiping, and of course the prisoners in jail were to be included in the evacuation.

Chengde Prison at that time held various types of prisoners, including 179 convicted prisoners and 154 prisoners awaiting trial, totaling 233 prisoners. Of the cases, prisoners who manufactured and smoked drugs accounted for two-thirds of the total number, while the remainder were bandits, robbers, thieves, swindlers, murderers, and corrupt officials, with varying numbers of each type of prisoner.

On May 28, Prison Warden Yang Zheng, in accordance with the "Temporary Handling Measures for Prisoners in Various Prisons and Detention Centers in the Buffer Zone," sought and obtained the approval of Commander Shi Jue and immediately began to implement the evacuation. The method of evacuation was to transfer 16 convicted felons (including bandits, robbers, and murderers) to Beiping for imprisonment, and to release 209 prisoners on bail. The 18 prisoners who could not obtain bail were transported by the military in trucks to Shuangtashan, and each was rewarded with two liters of rice and expelled from the territory. In this way, the evacuation was successfully completed by June 3, and the staff of the two high courts also flew to Beiping safely. Thus, the expelled prisoners were both pardoned and rewarded, and in the midst of gratitude and surprise, they were happy to slip away. The prisoners released on bail thought that "posting bail" was a procedure to deal with the official arena, and they were fortunate to have this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get out of prison, feeling relaxed. However, Chengde was expensive to live in, and many of them had no intention of staying, so they went to other places to make a living. As Ouyang Xiu said in the past: "To release them intending that they will surely come, is the feeling of the superior deceiving the inferior. To expect that they will be acquitted and return again, is the heart of the inferior deceiving the superior." Regarding these two speculations, it seems that no one at that time had the leisure to think about them, and it was only natural that these parolees did not think about coming back later.

In mid-June, after the successful conclusion of the Chengde defense battle, the market gradually returned to normal. However, most of the staff of the two high courts were still in Beiping due to traffic conditions. It was not until the end of August that a small number were able to return one after another. Then, the issue of "pursuing prisoners" was brought up again. On September 1, the warden of Chengde Prison issued a notice stating that: all prisoners who were released on bail "in accordance with the provisions of the 'Temporary Handling Measures for Prisoners in Various Prisons and Detention Centers in the Buffer Zone', were released on bail or released and set free in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the aforementioned measures 'when order is restored, a notice shall be issued, setting a time limit for reporting; if they fail to report after the deadline, they shall be pursued for bail or wanted'. Now, this city has announced the lifting of martial law and restored normalcy. This notice is hereby issued, requiring all prisoners to comply and report to this prison or nearby police station within five days after the issuance of the notice. If they fail to report after the deadline, they will be pursued for bail or wanted in accordance with the law. Do not wait and delay." Now, it is already late September, and the deadline specified in the notice has obviously exceeded the limit and been "delayed."

To this end, the reporter made a special visit to Chengde Prison. Jiang Fajun, the head of the general affairs section of the prison, was holding a meeting to discuss prison affairs. According to Jiang, since the "pursuing prisoners" notice was posted, as of September 15, only two prisoners had returned to prison to report: one was a drug addict, Yang Zhimin, 23 years old, who had been sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment, with the term expiring on November 1. The other was a thief, Ren Yunheng, 43 years old, who had been sentenced to four months of imprisonment, but the term had already exceeded the sentence after deducting the bail period. In addition, a large number of prisoners had already left Chengde City and were actively being pursued for bail. According to Prosecutor Zhang of the District Court, "Prisoners who fail to report after the deadline should be guilty of escape under the law, but Chengde's environment is different, traffic is blocked, and news transmission is obviously slow. Although the prisoners' return date has been exceeded, it can still be handled leniently as appropriate. If they deliberately evade, which hinders the closing of the case, the judicial authorities will maintain the dignity of the law and immediately take strict measures to pursue the bail and issue arrest warrants."

So, how many of these prisoners can be recovered in the end? The answer is obviously uncertain, but according to general observation, most prisoners "have already gone to other places to make a living," which is a fact. Among these people, most belong to minor crimes. In fact, each prisoner is given 25 taels of official rice per day, plus a food allowance. This may be better than what they eat at home. The main reason for their failure to return to the case does not seem to be entirely to avoid punishment. However, if they go and never return, continuing to "delay" indefinitely, then it will be difficult to avoid strict pursuit of the guarantor and the issuance of arrest warrants. As for the ancient feat of the three hundred prisoners who, after being released, "eventually returned without a single one missing," it can only be left to others to excel.

### Looking at Danyang with New Eyes: Initial Success in Dredging and Reclaiming Lian Lake

— Our Reporter Li Tianxing

[Our Newspaper Wujin, 25th] Danyang, on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, is undeniably a barren little county with a population of just over 400,000. Its customs and folklore are neither like those of Jiangnan nor like those of Subei, and its dialects are particularly complex. Not only are they different from those of Suzhou and Changzhou, or Zhenjiang and Nanjing, but even within Danyang itself, the speech of the city and the countryside differs. The speech of the four city gates in the east, west, south, and north also varies. Danyang speech is not only difficult to understand, but especially difficult to speak. It is not difficult for someone from another county to learn a sentence or two in the dialects of Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, or Shanghai, but it is quite difficult to learn a sentence or two of Danyang dialect. Politics, economy, and culture are all relatively backward. Moreover, in the early days of the War of Resistance, the enemy's frantic bombing and artillery fire destroyed more than 80% of the entire city of Danyang. A scene of broken walls and ruins made the ancient city of Yunyang Qu'a even more desolate.

However, along with victory came a new birth for Danyang. Mr. Shu Yunzhang became Danyang's savior. Shu is a native of Danyang who left his hometown for Tianjin in the north at the age of ten or so. After decades of hard work, he achieved success and status. Now in his sixties, mindful of his roots and loving his hometown, he planned the construction of his hometown early on. Starting in the year of victory, he first built a tall chimney near the station outside the North Gate, establishing the Danyang Yarn Factory with a total capital of 50 billion. The factory buildings are completely new. Currently, 10,000 spindles are spinning day and night, producing more than 700 pieces of yarn per month, mostly 20-count fine yarn. The brand is "Danyang Phoenix Facing the Sun," which sells well in the Changzhou and Shanghai areas. The machinery is all from the United States, dating back to 1941, and is considered a new type in China, saving labor. Another 10,000 spindles of machinery have arrived and are being installed. According to Manager Wang of the factory, it can be completed within the year, and all 20,000 spindles can be put into operation. The power was initially supplied by the Qixia Weir Power Plant, but now a Siemens generator has been installed for self-generation, which is currently sufficient for operation. This is the first sound of Danyang's emerging industry. Mr. Shu's original plan was for the yarn factory to have 30,000 spindles, another weaving factory with 1,000 looms, a flour mill, and a machine factory. With Mr. Shu's courage, it should be no problem to realize these plans step by step.

Mr. Shu's second major project is the dredging and reclamation of Lian Lake. Lian Lake is located outside the west gate of Danyang, bordering the city. It is also known as Lian Pond or the Rear Lake of Qu'a. It was the site where Xi Jian of the Jin Dynasty supervised the training of naval forces, hence the name "Lian" (training). It covers an area of more than 15,000 mu, formerly connected to the Grand Canal in the east and receiving runoff from the highlands of the Maoshan Mountains in the southwest. Its circumference is more than 40 li, and its vast expanse of water serves as a reservoir for the irrigation of 50,000 mu of farmland around the lake. Over the years, sand and silt have accumulated, and the lake bottom has become silted up. It has turned into a sea change. Proposals to dredge and reclaim it have been made for years, but limited financial resources have prevented them from being realized. It has always been a scene of wild water and lush grass, becoming a regret for Danyang. When Shu Yunjun returned, he raised his voice and commanded as he wished, and things finally began to take shape. A dredging and reclamation organization was first established, a committee specifically responsible for the matter. The dredging and reclamation goals and guidelines are half dredging the lake to ensure the water conservancy of 50,000 mu of farmland around the lake, and half reclaiming the southeastern half of the lake for farming. Open up fields, build new villages, plant flowers and trees on the long embankment, and raise fish and grow lotus in the lake. Use scientific methods to seek production, arrange scenery, and build a new type of Lian Lake with villas, yachts, and a new attitude, to prosper the entire Danyang. Therefore, the vision is very beautiful, not only not an illusion, but also practical.

For the first phase of dredging funds, Mr. Shu donated 13 billion. The Danyang County Government used 1,000 shi of grain, the Danyang Yarn Factory bore 1,200 shi of grain, and the Forest Department subsidized 1 billion. Work began repeatedly this spring and has achieved initial success to date. First:

Two small pumping stations have been fully completed, located in the east of Lian Lake, near the north gate of Danyang. The construction is entirely new, cast in reinforced concrete. One is responsible for inflow, and the other for outflow. This is to regulate the water conservancy of Lian Lake and maintain a certain high and low water level. The Grand Canal is used for intake and discharge, so there is no fear of flooding. Another organization has been set up to be specifically responsible for this. Second:

Two agricultural reclamation areas have also been established. The first agricultural reclamation area covers 600 mu and is located at the southeast end of Lian Lake, adjacent to the city. Reclamation work began in early summer, with an agricultural reclamation committee specifically responsible for it. Dikes have been built all around, with deep ditches. The land is flat as far as the eye can see, and more than 500 mu have been planted with japonica rice. A green expanse, vast as the sea, with drooping rice ears, strong and upright, inspires excitement. A bumper autumn harvest is expected this year. The person in charge told reporters: Each mu can yield at least 600 to 700 jin of grain, with labor and material costs of about one shi of rice per mu. Production does not fall short, and the surplus gives people even greater excitement. The tone of the person in charge also feels energetic! The second reclamation area is currently being actively developed, and the embankment has been completed. More than 4,400 mu will be a large area, laid out in front, waiting to be released. According to Director Zou of agricultural reclamation, wheat will definitely be sown this autumn. The seeds have been borrowed from the Jiangsu Provincial Agricultural Improvement Institute, more than 17,000 jin, but it is still not enough. People across the country who care about rural revitalization and agricultural innovation have also come to Danyang to inspect. On the 19th of this month, Fang Mao of the Forest Department, Zhang Zhiwen of the Jinling University Agricultural College, agricultural experts Zou Bingwen and Runzhi, and others gathered at Lian Lake to conduct on-the-spot inspections and provide detailed plans. The goal is to actively develop and create a new miracle on Lian Lake. In the evening breeze, with the sun setting, at a time when the rice flowers are fragrant and the sunset is red, a group of forty or fifty farmers, carrying hoes on their shoulders, barefoot, very strong and comfortable, finish their work and return to the agricultural reclamation office to rest. This scene truly reflects the greatness of the work and the greatness of the construction. In addition to the agricultural reclamation water station, there is also an organization specifically responsible for breeding, which mainly uses the water area for fish, chicken, and duck farming. Some of the fish fry ponds are full. Some of the grown fish have been released into the ditches for breeding. Lian Lake fish are plentiful in the Danyang market, and in the future, there will certainly be no end to fish, shrimp, and crabs. Chicken and duck farming is certainly a part of the business, but it is still waiting for planning and practical implementation.

This new development has inspired the people of Danyang and made every visiting tourist look at Danyang with new eyes. As a passing reporter, after a tour, I cannot help but be very excited. Therefore, I quickly write this report to inform the people of the country, hoping that provinces, counties, and cities across ancient China will be inspired and prioritize construction and new beginnings, learning from Danyang!

### Sichuan Chemical Fertilizer Plant: US to Loan $6 Million

[Our Newspaper Chengdu, 25th] The famous chemist Hou Debang, general manager of Yongli Chemical Company, came to Sichuan for Yongli's Sichuan business and to assist in Sichuan's construction. Recently, upon his return to Nanjing after finishing his official business, he told reporters: (1) The United States has agreed to loan $6 million for the purchase of machinery for the Sichuan Chemical Fertilizer Plant, but the agreement will only be formally signed and payments made after domestic funds have been raised and the Central Bank has issued a certificate. The Nongmin Bank will undertake $3 million of the $4.5 million that needs to be raised domestically, which is no problem. However, the $1.5 million that Sichuan Province needs to raise itself must wait until after consultations with the Sichuan Construction Department before formal preparations can be made. (2) The deep well exploration work currently being carried out at the Yongli Sichuan Plant in Wutongqiao is yielding good quality black brine. It has already been explored to a depth of 1,000 feet, and new machinery has been purchased from the United States to carry out the next step of work. Yongli is determined to develop underground resources, determine and develop raw materials such as salt brine, oil, and gas, to strengthen assistance to Sichuan's industry.

### A True Picture of the Flood in Qinghai

In late August of this year, Qinghai experienced successive heavy rains, and mountain floods occurred frequently. The disaster-stricken areas covered all counties in the province. The severity of the situation has not been seen in nearly a century. This newspaper has reported on the details of the disaster in several special dispatches and features. The Qinghai Provincial Government has mobilized manpower from all over the province to actively carry out rescue efforts, and transportation has gradually resumed. However, the province's vitality has been greatly damaged. All the projects that need to be restored due to the flood, as well as rural relief and the resettlement of disaster victims, require a large amount of financial resources. The province's financial resources are insufficient, and it is hoped that people in the country will show sympathy and lend a hand. The central government, understanding the plight of more than one million people in Qinghai and the needs of national defense construction, has promptly allocated emergency relief funds. The disaster victims in the province are fortunate to receive relief, and border national defense has been restored early. Pictured here is the situation near Xining.

### Disputes Arise Due to Incorrect Accounting After Currency Reform

[Our Newspaper Chengdu, 25th Dispatch] Recently, a major dispute occurred here due to an error in a voucher after the currency reform. The only Qiming Electric Light Company in the city had a depositor named Kang Jian who deposited 150 gold yuan. However, a staff member of the company mistakenly wrote 1.5 million gold yuan on the voucher and deposit slip. When the accounts were reconciled in the evening, the error was discovered. The depositor then sent a letter stating that he had deposited 150,000 gold yuan. Although the company tried to explain, the depositor insisted on the figure of 150,000 yuan and prepared to ask the court for a ruling. The dispute has now escalated, and the person in charge of the company has resigned to take responsibility. The chairman, Xiang Chuanyi, is trying to mediate. This error was caused by the deeply ingrained impression of the number of legal tender currency and serves as a warning to staff members of general companies and firms.

### Ministry of Finance Issues Instructions on Early Repayment of Legal Tender Bonds: Bonds That Matured Before August 19th Will Still Be Repaid According to the Original Method and Cannot Apply for Doubling

[Our Newspaper News] The Central Bank's Department has approved the Ministry of Finance's announcement that the measures for handling government legal tender bonds have been approved and promulgated by the Executive Yuan. Early repayment will be handled according to the regulations, starting on October 1, 37th year of the Republic of China, and should be implemented as scheduled. In order to provide a basis for bondholders and managing banks to apply for handling, the Ministry of Finance has formulated the following instructions for handling early repayment of government legal tender bonds. After receiving the Ministry of Finance's telegram and the instructions for handling early repayment, the Central Bank's Treasury Bureau has notified its branches to investigate and handle accordingly. The instructions are divided as follows:

1.  In accordance with the regulations of the measures for handling government legal tender bonds, the Ministry of Finance has designated the Central Bank and its entrusted banks to manage the early repayment of government legal tender bonds. The Bank of China has been entrusted to handle matters abroad.

2.  The government bonds for early repayment stipulated in the above measures are limited to the principal and interest coupons that were actually sold and issued over the years and had not yet matured on August 19, 37th year of the Republic of China. For those that had already matured before that date, bondholders should extract them themselves and exchange them for gold yuan at the managing bank according to the original repayment method. They should not be mixed into the immature principal and interest coupons and apply for double repayment.

3.  Legal tender bonds allocated by the government as collateral for bank loans without actual sale will be handled separately by the Ministry of Finance and are not included in the above-mentioned early repayment. However, if legal tender bonds held by bondholders are used as collateral for private loans, they will still be repaid early.

4.  The standard for calculating the doubling of various bonds for the above-mentioned early repayment shall be in accordance with the attached table of the measures for handling government legal tender bonds, and income tax shall be deducted from the interest.

5.  When applying for early repayment, the original holder should first obtain an application form from the managing bank, fill in the name, type, number of bonds, amount, number of attached interest coupons, and the amount of gold yuan to be exchanged in detail, affix a seal, and affix the same seal on the upper corner of the bond before submitting it to the managing bank for exchange.

6.  After receiving the application form and bonds submitted by the bondholder, the managing bank should verify the secret marks on each bond to see if they match the sample, and whether the numbers have matured before August 19, 37th year of the Republic of China, or have been reported lost and invalidated, and payment has been stopped. They should also check whether the number of interest coupons submitted is missing, etc. If no errors are found after checking, the payment will be made immediately. If payment cannot be made immediately, a receipt may be issued first, and the payment date may be scheduled.

7.  The principal and interest coupons that have been verified to be correct and approved for payment should be punched and invalidated by the managing bank. As usual, the managing bank's head office should submit them to the Ministry of Finance for verification and cancellation.

8.  The most recent coupon of each bond, which matures after August 20, 37th year of the Republic of China, should be submitted together with the principal coupon for repayment. If any are missing, the interest for that period will not be repaid. However, the three types of bonds: 25th year Reconstruction Bonds, 26th year National Salvation Bonds, and the first installment of 29th year Military Needs Bonds, all have the most recent two coupons that mature after August 20, 37th year of the Republic of China.

If the bondholder only submits the most recent coupon (or two coupons) mentioned above without submitting the principal coupon, repayment should be approved. However, if the gold yuan calculated after doubling these interest coupons is less than one cent, it should be calculated and repaid by rounding to the nearest cent.

In addition to the above-mentioned most recent coupon (or two coupons), if any of the subsequent coupons are missing, the bondholder should publish a statement in the newspaper declaring them invalid before applying for repayment.

9.  For the various legal tender bonds repaid early, the income tax on the interest shall be deducted at the prescribed rate based on the total amount obtained by doubling the interest received by the bondholder. If the income tax is less than one gold yuan, it shall be calculated by rounding to the nearest whole number.

10. If the managing bank encounters special circumstances when handling the early repayment of legal tender bonds, it should immediately report it to the Ministry of Finance for verification and handling.

11. The period for early repayment is set from October 1, 37th year of the Republic of China to March 31, 38th year of the Republic of China. If bondholders have not applied for repayment by the deadline, all bonds will be invalidated?

12. These instructions should be posted and announced by the managing banks in various locations to inform the public.

### Scarce Arrivals and Smooth Sales: Rice Supply Falls Short of Demand, Coarse Grains Strong and Expensive, Oil Market Approaching Price Limits

Rice transactions are increasingly sluggish. Arrivals are scarce, with only 294 *shi* registered in the northern part of the city and 1,472 *shi* in the southern part. Therefore, the supply remains limited. Not only is *japonica* rice rare, but even *indica* rice is scarce. Some high-quality rice has prices but no transactions. Only milled *indica* and *ducheng* rice have some sales. Samples are quickly sold out, leaving no supply to meet demand in the future market.

Flour sales remain stagnant. Unless factories start selling, the stalemate in transactions will be difficult to break. Moreover, rationed flour continues as usual, with allocations every three days without interruption.

Coarse grains are strong and expensive, with few transactions. Soybean supplies are limited, making procurement difficult in the local market. Corn arrivals are already rare, with only two to three hundred bags sold. Red sorghum remains at ten yuan. Buckwheat trading is active due to demand from out-of-town merchants. Pea prices hold steady. Broad bean transactions are minimal. Sesame prices have risen by five *jiao* due to sluggish sales. Raw peanuts have not opened yet.

Edible oil is gradually rising. Crude oil remains stable because it is already close to the price limit. Pure crude oil is still 59.90 yuan. Soybean oil factories are releasing more supply, with prices generally around fifty yuan, an increase of eight *jiao*. Vegetable oil is forty-seven yuan, up one yuan, approaching the price limit. Cooked vegetable oil rises again by one yuan and five *jiao*. Small cart sesame oil is transacted at the limit price. Soybean cake supply is scarce, with Datong brand opening at two hundred pieces.

### Banking and Financial Industries Agree to Further Reduce Interest Rates

The three associations of banking, money lending, and trust industries, in accordance with the authorities' explicit orders, will further reduce deposit and loan interest rates from the first of next month. The agreed-upon rates are 1.60 yuan per thousand for daily loans, five *jiao* for daily deposits, and one yuan for the loan industry’s daily loans. The three associations made this decision at a meeting yesterday, and all members will be notified to implement it accordingly.

### Ministry of Finance Readjusts Margin for Check Clearing

[Our Newspaper] It has been learned from the Central Bank that after the currency reform, the amount of margin paid by all banks and firms for check clearing should be adjusted. It has now been stipulated that, except for Shanghai, where the exchange should be determined by the clearing house, every bank and firm in the cities of Tianjin, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Beiping, Hankou, Qingdao, Chongqing, Guiyang, Xi'an, Kunming, and Chengdu will pay 10,000 gold yuan. Wuxi, Wuxian, Tiejiang, Wujin, Changshu, Xuzhou, Jiangdu, Hangzhou, Zhengxian, Shaoxing, Yongkang, Yuyao, Bengbu, Wuhu, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Zhongshan, Nanhai, Xinhui, Wan'an, Taishan, Shantou, Guilin, Cangwu, Changsha, Quyang, Wuchang, Shashi, Yichang, Neijiang, Yibin, Wanxian, Pixian, Leshan, Zigong, Guiyang, Jinan, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Taiyuan, Lanzhou, Bian'e, Taipei, Taichung, Changhua, Keelung, and Kaohsiung will each pay 5,000 gold yuan. All other cities and counties will pay 3,000 gold yuan. The bank has also issued a circular to its branches and offices for compliance.

### Sluggish Cotton Yarn Transactions, Few Cloth Tokens, Prices Firm

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw considerable hesitation among industry participants due to rumors of price limit adjustments. Sellers became reluctant to sell, and both buyers and sellers adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Trading in the market trended toward scarcity again. However, outbound transportation remained blocked, and out-of-town buyers rarely made purchases. Local sales were sluggish due to the ban on transportation, and inventories were low. Nevertheless, sporadic sales continued.

The market supply of 42-count fine yarn was limited to the Golden Chicken and Red Man Clock brands. 40-count Jincheng and other brands were all secretly asking for ten yuan extra. 32-count rose by 3.5 yuan. 21-count Double Horse remained at the limit price of 783 yuan. Except for the 20-count Cai Kuixing coarse yarn, which was discounted, the rest were transacted at the limit.

16-count popular yarn was rarely traded. Miscellaneous brands had some transactions. 10-count Boy Scout and other brands saw sales of 286 pieces by the Shenxin Yarn Factory, with 10-count yarn being more abundant, causing sellers to rush to sell, which weakened the market. The Fangjian Company continued to offer 20-count Nine Lions, with the price still at 700 yuan. Only 301 bales were sold.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw sparse transactions as today was the last day for registering inventory. Those shops with registered goods mostly took a wait-and-see attitude as procedures were being completed. With the market in other areas turning sluggish and local money supply easing, and with rumors of cotton yarn and cloth being transported to the south based on the actual needs of Guangdong, Fujian, and Taiwan, sentiment improved, tokens were scarce, and the market surged.

12-pound Longtou fine cloth initially showed a slight increase of two *jiao*. The supply was insufficient after the opening, and out-of-town buyers and local shops searched eagerly, causing the price to rise again to 27.8 yuan. The afternoon close was at 27.6 yuan, a jump of 1.2 yuan compared to the previous day. B-brand Longtou also rose by nine *jiao*. Wufu and mid-range Laba Baby and other fine cloths, as well as Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji and Zhigong, also rose from three *jiao* to over one yuan. Many also reached the price limit. Due to demand exceeding supply, the total volume of transactions was two-thirds lower, only 1,180 bolts.

### Rayon Allocation Price Unchanged

[Our Newspaper] The China Trust Bureau held another rayon meeting yesterday, deciding that the price of rayon from September 27th to October 2nd would remain the same as last week. Italian rayon will still be sold at 1,033.3 yuan per case. Furthermore, the bureau recently shipped forty cases of rayon to Tianjin for allocation to factories there.

Additionally: The rayon market is sluggish because the industry lacks a continuous supply. Most holders are taking a wait-and-see approach. Few sellers exist under the price limits, making the market quiet.

Continuous Supply Requested

The Rayon Commercial Association, in order to support the national policy of currency reform, has been handing over all inventory before August 19th to the association for allocation and sale at the price limit on a daily basis. For over a month, due to the lack of continuous supply, inventory has been decreasing while demand is increasing. Therefore, a request for supply adjustment has been made to the Materials Adjustment Committee.

### Sugar Prices Stop Falling and Rise

Yesterday's sugar market stopped falling and turned upward. Due to continuous declines in recent days, sentiment turned bullish, stimulating buying. Holders took the opportunity to raise prices, causing the market to become firm.

### Directorate of Import Control Announces Annex (II) Goods, Import Quotas for the Seventh and Eighth Quarters, Totaling US$42,141,000

[Our Newspaper] The import quotas for the seventh and eighth quarters of Annex (II) goods under the Import and Export Trade Regulations have been submitted by the Directorate of Import Control to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. Except for battle-damaged cars and jeeps, as well as motor vehicles and long-distance buses, for which the government does not provide foreign exchange, which will be determined after further investigation. Gasoline, diesel, kerosene, lubricating oil, and lubricating grease have had their import quotas reduced due to American aid supply.

### Operating Expenses for Secondary and Higher Education Institutions Temporarily Revised Based on Pre-War Amounts, Aims for Practical Implementation and Gradual Increase

[Nanjing Dispatch on the 29th] Operating expenses for secondary and higher education institutions previously had established standards that were followed. Since the War of Resistance, currency fluctuations have led to repeated adjustments by the Ministry of Education, but these have failed to keep pace with the price index, resulting in lower standards and a proliferation of poorly funded schools. With the currency reform, all financial regulations must be revised. The Ministry of Education believes that restoring pre-war standards is necessary to consolidate the foundation of schools and enrich their content. However, given the current socio-economic conditions, there are still many difficulties. To balance reality, the expenses are temporarily revised based on the pre-war amounts, converted to gold yuan, which is only half of the original standard. This aims for practical implementation. When socio-economic conditions improve in the future, the expenses will be gradually increased to reach the original pre-war standards. The Ministry of Education has issued Instruction No. 52746 to all to follow. After the promulgation of these standards, the original table of minimum operating and annual recurring expenses for private secondary and higher education institutions is abolished. All schools should immediately follow the new standards. Existing schools with insufficient funding should increase their funding within a specified period and report for verification. Newly established schools must first raise sufficient funding before being allowed to be established.

### Shanghai Police Department's Response to the Complaint of Fire Victims on Xinmin Road, Zhabei

Zhun Kui and Da Er, fire victims of Xinmin Road, complained that the Zhabei Nanxing Road Private Fire Brigade (i.e., the First Section Fire Brigade of Northern Shanghai) handled the situation poorly, resulting in severe damage, requesting investigation of responsibilities. Upon investigation, the brigade's response seemed slightly delayed when arriving at the scene of the fire. Instructions have been given to rectify this and intensify training. As for the brigade collecting 50,000 yuan in temporary fees to add ten pairs of firefighting dragon heads, they were already installed in October of last year and supported by bills from Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. The claim that only one or two pairs were installed is not true. In addition to instructing them to report and publicize their income and expenditure according to regulations, we are responding for your review! Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Police Department. September 20th.

### Travel Impressions of Hangzhou

— Ji Mo

Recently, I have rarely read travelogues. Perhaps it is because non-professional writers cannot find time to travel amid their busy schedules, while professional writers, given the high cost, find it more cost-effective to spend money on reference materials to find topics for writing. Therefore, even if we occasionally read articles in newspapers about the specialties of a certain place, they mostly focus on collecting anecdotes and elaborating on some insights, which seem far from the realm of "allowing readers to take a virtual tour."

Although I have long intended to travel, it was not until recently, when I accompanied a friend to Hangzhou for business, that I fulfilled my long-held wish.

We departed on a gloomy morning, taking the 7:05 am train. The scenery of the fields along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway is similar to that of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. However, the houses dotted among the rice paddies have upward-curving eaves, which are different from what we usually see in Suzhou. The stations along the way, such as Chang'an and Xiashi, seem less affluent than those in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway.

At 11:45 am that day, a little less than five hours after departure, we arrived in Hangzhou. After passing through the tunnel and exiting the station, I looked back at the railway station building, which was built with stones engraved with various patterns, resembling a palace or a temple, quite magnificent.

Outside the station is a wide, asphalt road with a constant stream of vehicles. We wanted to go to Yue Wang's Tomb. Rickshaw pullers asked for prices ranging from six jiao to one yuan. Later, we inquired from passers-by and instead took a No. 1 bus near the station, which cost only 200,000 yuan per person in legal tender. After arriving at the lakeside, we transferred to a Yonghua Company bus, which took us directly to Yuefen Street, costing only 350,000 yuan in legal tender.

During the journey and on the bus, I noticed that Hangzhou women dressed very plainly. Only two or three out of ten had permed hair. They also wore unfashionable "basketball shoes" for their sturdiness and durability. After returning to Shanghai, I even heard a colleague from Hangzhou say that undershirts and tank tops were still selling well locally, while sweaters were not in demand. This shows the frugality of Hangzhou's atmosphere.

Speaking of which, after arriving at Yue Wang's Tomb, we went to Yue Wang Temple to pay our respects. In my humble opinion, Yue Wang Temple must have been an added building. Initially, there was only the burial ground, and then the temple was built, and the ancestral hall to worship Yue Fei's parents was added. Therefore, we determined that Yue Wang's Tomb was very simple in structure and not even as grand as the mausoleum of a wealthy family. There is a pair each of stone figures, stone horses, and stone sheep in front of the tomb. At the entrance, there are four kneeling stone statues of Qin Hui and his wife, separated by fences.

Yue Wang's Tomb and Yue Yun's Tomb are both semicircular, with cement poured on the outside. I went around to the back of the tomb and noticed that there was a gap in the cement, revealing the black bricks inside. There is a couplet inscribed by Feng Yuxiang, who recently passed away, on the stone pillar in front of Yue Wang's Tomb.

Another feature of Yue Temple is the abundance of plaques and couplets, which almost fill the main gate and corners of the building. Most of those who have signed their names are figures from the warlord era, such as Zhang Zongchang and He Fenglin. Their intention is nothing more than to attach themselves to Yue Temple, hoping to achieve immortality. But their words and deeds have long been forgotten by the world.

After leaving Yue Temple, I hired a rickshaw again to pull along the West Lake to the flagpole, at a fare of 3.5 jiao per vehicle. The weather was intermittently sunny and rainy, so I was unable to get out of the car and appreciate the beautiful scenery of West Lake. In my humble opinion, the beauty of West Lake lies in its vastness, which is boundless. Second, it is tranquil, with calm water and a sense of being detached from the world. Third, it is a victory in setting off the scenery, with distant mountains stacked on top of each other, with varying shades of color, no less than a masterpiece of landscape painting.

After the rickshaw pulled us to the flagpole, although we had eaten some refreshments on the train, we felt hungry, so we went into a × Wei Guan, a restaurant with a grand facade.

The restaurant had already passed lunchtime, and there were few customers. We ordered half a catty of wine and two simple dishes. We also asked the waiter if there were any seasonal dishes. He said there was a stir-fried blue crab, priced at three yuan per plate. We thought the price was too high and did not order it. My friend also ordered clams and ham. The waiter replied that it was sold out. So we slowly ate the dishes we had ordered.

During this time, we were "bamboozled." Because after we returned to Shanghai, we found that the bill listed clams and ham, which had not been served. Considering the few customers in the restaurant at the time, the possibility of deliberate error was greater than that of negligent listing. I hope that readers who visit the restaurant in Hangzhou will pay attention and not repeat my mistakes.

After the meal, we strolled through the city of Hangzhou. The areas of Guankou, Sanyuanfang, and Qinghefang are lined with shops. All major banks are located here. Police officers at street corners use whistles to direct traffic, which is different from those who use traffic lights.

Due to my worldly affairs, I returned to Shanghai with my friend on the night train at 7 p.m. Fortunately, transportation between Shanghai and Hangzhou is convenient, and there are acquaintances in Hangzhou who can provide meals and accommodation. I will have to carefully savor the famous scenic spots on my second trip to Hangzhou in the future. Moreover, a Hangzhou native told us that it would take fifteen days just to explore the inside and outside of West Lake and that it would not be possible to thoroughly tour it in a few days.

### Thinking of Others

— Chen Yanfan

Always thinking of others is a virtue in dealing with the world, and it is also the key to gaining more meaning and interest in life. A and B are two people with very different temperaments, but they are acquaintances who can often meet each other. Once, I went to C's house and saw A there. He was also there to see Mr. C. Later, B also came, and B also wanted to find Mr. C to talk about something. Mr. C walked away, leaving A and B sitting in the study, not saying a word, not even looking at each other. It was really awkward, yet also laughable, to see two acquaintances acting like enemies. I almost laughed out loud.

But Mr. C has one good point: he understands all kinds of people. He likes stubborn and dull people as much as he likes happy and frivolous people. He often thinks of others, carefully observing their temperaments, as if he were trying on clothes of different styles. Between two people with different personalities, you can find that there must be one person who holds many prejudices, thinking, "B is always a child." "B will never amount to anything. He is so childish and superficial." B, on the other hand, must be thinking, "He is so arrogant. He is always looking down on me." Because of this, it is difficult to have a meaningful conversation, so much so that even though they are in the same room, they do not speak to each other, as if there is some old grudge. I don't understand: why do they take minor differences so seriously?

Carefully examining each person's personality is a very interesting thing. Not only looking at others, but also taking some time to look at yourself is equally rewarding. Why are stingy people like that? Why are vicious and selfish people like that? Impatient people, mean and calculating people, hypocritical people, they are all interesting. Once, an impatient and vulgar person lost his temper with me, but I was laughing at his angry expression. Although I didn't laugh out loud, I didn't listen to his meaningless scolding. Although I suffered a loss, I still thought of those who took advantage of others—I often do that. Perhaps it is a sign of weakness, but this choice is natural for me because I think it suits me better.

Some people say that so-and-so has a very strange temper. Because he is usually aloof and withdrawn, he suddenly loses his temper and scolds people. Some people say that the old lady is very annoying because she is extremely stingy and constantly scolds the servants and nephews. Perhaps by getting closer to them, understanding their characters and inner suffering, and always thinking of them, we will find that they are not strange or annoying. People's personalities and behaviors are layered, as a certain Western writer said: "Everyone is like a book," perhaps that is what he meant.

### Price Controls and Thrift

— Qian Dacheng

Since the advocacy of the thrift movement, the response from all parties has been extremely good, and special telegrams expressing support are often seen in the newspapers. However, what is the actual situation?

In my hometown teahouse, I saw a group of tea drinkers. When ordering refreshments, steamed buns were clearly price-controlled at 50,000 yuan each, and sesame cakes at 70,000 yuan each; but there were many people who strained their throats and asked people to custom-make steamed buns for 100,000 yuan or 150,000 yuan each, and sesame cakes for 150,000 yuan or 200,000 yuan each, showing off their wealth, as if they were afraid that the refreshments were being sold too cheaply, simply encouraging price increases. With such social customs, what is the use of government price controls? It is difficult to change this trend for a while. The government advocates thrift, but what is the use of officials simply setting some thrift regulations and posting some slogans if they cannot lead by example? Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the senior officials here issued an order prohibiting subordinates from giving gifts. But I saw many civil servants wearing Zhongshan suits and badges carrying gifts on the street, hurrying to and fro, but I never heard of superiors returning the gifts from their subordinates, even though they had already violated the order of the senior officials. Perhaps they believe that "benevolent rule is inseparable from human feelings," although there is a solemn order, the subordinates' small expression of filial piety cannot be ignored, right? Alas, human feelings! Great are human feelings! If we only talk about human feelings, what else can we talk about price controls? What else can we talk about thrift? The wealthy are unwilling to be thrifty, and the common people are already suffering unspeakably, so there is no talk of thrift. If the wealthy people themselves are willing to be thrifty, and those above lead by example, fostering a good atmosphere of frugality as a virtue, then there will be no need to set any regulations, nor to post slogans, nor to control prices. Naturally, no one will buy things that are too expensive. However, it is impossible to achieve this good atmosphere in one fell swoop. Failing that, if the government's price controls and advocacy of thrift are ineffective for a while, it is better to exert various pressures or sanctions on those influential people. At the same time, those in power should lead by example and no longer give people a reason to criticize. Perhaps there is a way. But thrift is ultimately a temporary solution; the fundamental solution is to work hard to increase production. After treating both the symptoms and the root cause, the term "price control" can disappear invisibly. The above is just a scholar's view. I'm afraid someone next to me is laughing and calling it "sour grapes"?

### Why Not Try It

— Wanli

(1) Write down your house number.

(2) Multiply by 2.

(3) Add 5.

(4) Multiply by 50.

(5) Add your age.

(6) Add 365.

(7) Subtract 615.

You will get a strange number. The first part of the number is your house number, and the second part is your age.

### Yu Dafu's Birth Year

— Chen Congzhou

Recently, Mr. Lu Danlin in this journal's "Yu Dafu's Will," according to the will prepared on the first day of the Yi You year, said that in the 34th year of the Republic of China (Yi You), Mr. Yu was 54 years old, then by calculation, he would be 57 years old this year. According to what I know, this year may be wrong. I will tentatively base this on Mr. Yu's "Zhi Mo in Memory" which mourns Xu Zhimo, which says: "New poems are spread throughout the universe, but you unexpectedly returned with the wind. Classmates of the same age, old friends like you have already rested. The Huabiao is entrusted with your spirit, when will you transform into a crane and return? In life and death, I deeply regret that I have a wife to write a requiem." He himself said that he was a classmate of Zhimo in the same class in the Hangzhou government in the second year of Xuantong (1910). Zhimo was born in the year of Bing Shen in the 22nd year of Guangxu (1896). If Mr. Yu was of the same age, he should have been born in 1896. By this calculation, he would be 53 years old this year, which would not be as far away as Mr. Lu's article says. I am afraid that some people think that the will he wrote himself must be correct, but there may be errors in transcription. If the will is really 54, then the will may be problematic. There is no one who is unwilling to truthfully write their age on their will. In the past, Zhu Guwei was unwilling to say his real age, but he notified Kuang Youhan before his death, which is one example. I wrote this to report to Mr. Lu, hoping he will agree.

### On the Beijing-Shanghai Train

— Yao Hechu

Rice paddies are green and yellow before the White Dew, distant peaks and trees compete in beauty, best suited to passing by the waterside, the eighth month of the Dian Lake's water connects to the sky. Pagoda trees are dense and bamboo is graceful, cattle sheds and pavilions are quiet and convenient, long days rushing and shaking the carts, the people in the house sleep with brick pillows.

### Returning Home from Duty to See Family Planting Vegetables

Evening wind should be clear and brisk, a slight chill is felt in the season, saying I will return soon, all causes are joyful, diligently working in the garden, I feel ashamed for my leisure, the frost and dew make the soil fat, I murmur awaiting the end of autumn.

Wang Yitang finally met his fate before the Mid-Autumn Festival this year after procrastinating for three years. During these three years, his every word and deed in the court and in the prison cell was a source of comedic material, recorded in detail by various newspapers, truly a compendium of jokes. Especially before his execution, when asked if he had anything to say, he shouted loudly asking to "appeal" and begging the president to "show mercy." Anyone with a little common sense would know that this was impossible and unreasonable. Never before has a condemned prisoner asked for "mercy" before execution. Not only could it not delay or prevent his death, but it added to the great joke, and we felt that his foolishness was beyond reach. (In the Qing Dynasty, condemned prisoners could "cry injustice before execution." To value human life, they were given a final opportunity to appeal and possibly be sent back for retrial. But there was no so-called "begging for mercy before execution," so it was not a question of favor.) For a person who came from a prestigious background and studied abroad to be so lazy is enough to represent an unbelievable transformation and decline of a portion of young people. Thinking of the general situation, I do not have time to lament for Mr. Wang.

Wang's original name was "Zhiyang." He was the top student in Hefei County's imperial examinations and was awarded the title of Xiucai. He studied hard since he was young, and at the age of 26, he became a Juren in the Jiangnan list (Chen Kangzu led the list) in the Gui Mao year. In the following year's provincial exams, he was quickly promoted to a high position (Tan Yanlan's list). He was then made a Jinshi through the imperial examinations and appointed as a chief. His early success was smooth. In the old days, countless people suffered for a lifetime without achieving success, and people like Wang were admired by many scholars. Moreover, after obtaining his title and official position, he actually aspired to study abroad and learn about the army, which was an outstanding performance. Because at that time, old literati were suspicious or afraid of Western learning, and they often said "we do not conspire with each other." Even if a small number of people resolutely understood the new, they could not imagine turning from writing to martial arts, putting down the pen and picking up the spear. Among thousands of scholars, there were only two people who became Jinshi, went abroad, and learned martial arts. One was Wang, and the other was Ling Guangxi (also a Jinshi of the Jia Chen year, in the same list). After Ling went to London and returned, he followed his father, Ling Zhongqi, the governor of Shanxi. During the Xinhai Revolution, father and son died together.) Those who became famous for their writing and calligraphy and then took up arms were rare. People praised them as role models for scholars, and the future of the country depended on such outstanding and unique young people. This is what the public opinion at the end of the Qing Dynasty admired.

Unexpectedly, at the beginning of the Republic of China, Wang immediately joined Yuan's camp, putting all his new and old learning behind him, and monopolized the "Unification Party," collected party fees, and bought party members to exclude dissidents. There was a rumor that he had "both hands grasping President Yuan and kicking Liang Shiyi away with one foot." When the old Duan was in power, he also monopolized the "Anfu Club," using the euphemism "buying fish" to send telegrams, representing "buying congressmen," hence the nickname "old boss of the fish market." The 30 years of the Republic of China's activities are described in Woqiu's "Biographies of Contemporary Celebrities," which is enough to determine his life, and I cannot bear to repeat it now.
