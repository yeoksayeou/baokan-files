### First Preparatory Meeting of the National Assembly: Election of Provisional Chairman and Secretary-General; Lively Discussion on the Election Law for the Presidium

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 30th] The first preparatory meeting of the National Assembly was held at 9:45 AM on the 30th. The Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee, Hong Lanyou, first reported two points: (1) A total of 1,798 delegates were present today, exceeding the legal quorum, and the meeting was declared open. (2) Before the presidium of the assembly is elected, the preparatory meeting today should elect a provisional chairman. Delegate Yu Youren then proposed that Hu Shi serve as the provisional chairman of the assembly and Hong Lanyou as the provisional secretary-general. Hu Shi, in turn, proposed Yu Youren. Finally, it was unanimously agreed that Hu Shi would serve as the provisional chairman of the assembly today. Mr. Hu arrived at the podium at 10:50 AM and first raised the issue of the provisional secretary-general. After a vote, Yu Youren's proposal that Hong Lanyou serve in the position was passed. After each took their positions, Mr. Hu announced the start of the discussion. Two items were scheduled for discussion today: (1) The draft method for electing the presidium of the assembly. (2) The draft method for arranging delegate seating. The first item was discussed first. After Hong Lanyou read the full text of the draft method, the delegates began to express their opinions. From 10:10 AM to 12:00 PM, when the meeting was legally adjourned, 35 people, including Pan Gongzhan, Gu Yuxiu, Li Zhonglin, and Yan Shaoyi, spoke. Because there were more than 50 people who had submitted requests to speak, and the time was insufficient, the chairman proposed an idea and sought the consent of the delegates. The secretariat would sort out the opinions expressed today, summarize them into several specific points, and submit them to the next preparatory meeting for discussion. If anyone has new opinions different from the summarized points, they can present them to the assembly. This was unanimously agreed upon. Finally, the chairman announced that the meeting would be adjourned this afternoon, and the second preparatory meeting would be held at 9:00 AM on the 31st. Yu Youren

The "Draft Method for Electing the Presidium," which was discussed today, was drafted by the National Assembly Preparatory Committee based on Article 5 of the National Assembly Organization Law. The draft stipulates: "(1) The presidium shall consist of 25 chairpersons, who shall be elected by the delegates from the general list of candidates for the presidium by secret ballot, with the candidates receiving the most votes being elected. In the event of a tie, the matter shall be decided by lot. (2) Candidates for the presidium shall be elected by each delegate-producing unit. Each unit shall have at least one candidate. Units with 30 or fewer delegates shall elect one candidate, 31 to 60 delegates shall elect two candidates, 61 to 90 delegates shall elect three candidates, 91 to 120 delegates shall elect four candidates, 121 to 150 delegates shall elect five candidates, and more than 151 delegates shall elect six candidates. Each unit with more than five candidates should have one woman. The candidates are elected using secret ballot, with the candidate who gets the most votes is elected (separate ballot for women), which will form the general candidate list. The elected candidates are not limited to the delegates produced by the unit. When each unit elects presidium candidates, the eldest delegate of each unit shall convene the meeting. (3) This method shall be implemented after being passed by the preparatory meeting of the National Assembly." The appendix lists the 60 units and the number of candidates that they should produce, a total of 133 candidates, including 11 women.

### Presidium Should Increase the Number of Seats So That Each Unit Can Participate; Pan Gongzhan's Opinion Wins Overwhelming Support

The election method stipulates that the number of presidium chairpersons is only 25, which the delegates have debated for a long time. They believe that according to the last Constituent National Assembly, the total number of delegates was only 2,024, and the presidium had as many as 55 chairpersons. The total number of delegates to this assembly has reached 3,045, an increase of 50% compared to the past. The number of presidium chairpersons has been reduced to 25, which is unreasonable. Moreover, since there are 48 delegate-producing units, in order to be universal and to accommodate opinions from all sides, the number of seats should be increased so that each unit has a representative to convey its views on the presidium. However, some people believe that this election method is based on the National Assembly Organization Law, which is based on Article 34 of the Constitution. If the number of presidium chairpersons is to be increased, the National Assembly Organization Law must be amended, which is equivalent to amending the Constitution. If the Constitution is not amended, it will be unconstitutional. Therefore, they argue that the number of seats should not be increased. In the meeting, more people agreed with the opinion of increasing the number of seats, and fewer people agreed with the latter opinion. When the delegates spoke, they also raised some opinions on the amount of increase and the method of production, etc. Delegate Pan Gongzhan put forward three opinions, saying: (1) The regulations on the number of presidium chairpersons must be revised. I believe that the National Assembly Organization Law formulated by the Legislative Yuan is too detailed. The Assembly should send the National Assembly Organization Law back to the Legislative Yuan and delete the sentence about the number of people, only listing "a certain number" is enough, and then the Assembly will discuss the number of people. (2) I believe that the number of presidium chairpersons should be increased by 50% according to the proportion of the Constituent National Assembly, that is, 55 plus 28, and this National Assembly should have 83 people. (3) According to the 60 units in the election method, each unit has one person, and the remaining 23 people are elected by the Assembly using the non-cumulative method, so that units such as regions and overseas Chinese at home and abroad can participate in the presidium, which can gather ideas and benefit. Mr. Pan also made some comments on the duties of the National Assembly delegates. He believes that the Legislative Yuan has stipulated too few presidium chairpersons, which seems to think that this National Assembly is only responsible for elections, which is easy to handle. In fact, the Assembly has the power to amend the Constitution, and we cannot say that it must not be amended. Discussion is one thing, and passing it is another matter. If the Constitution is amended, the Assembly will not be able to complete it by the 22nd, and the task will be heavy, which cannot be handled by the presidium of 25 people. Mr. Pan's opinion won the approval of the vast majority of delegates. After that, some delegates spoke, but none of them exceeded these principles. The enthusiasm of the discussion has opened up the grand occasion that this National Assembly must have.

### Debate on the Election of the Presidium

Special Report from Our Newspaper—(March 30 in Nanjing)

The representatives of public opinion from all over the country began their familiar debate on democratic politics in the National Assembly of constitutional implementation today. From the Constituent National Assembly to the Constitutional National Assembly, the test of public opinion has progressed more and more each time.

The preparatory meeting is only the prelude to the Assembly, and it is only themed with discussing the election method of the Presidium of the Assembly and the election of the candidates for the presidium. However, every minute and every process is almost an opportunity to strive for and exert public opinion. Therefore, the full text of the draft method for the election of the presidium, which contains a total of three articles, took a full two hours and has not yet reached a conclusion.

Today's Provisional Chairman is Principal Hu Shi, who has a gentle attitude and the demeanor of a diplomat. Every time Mr. Hu has a suggestion, he must ask again and again whether it is good or not, so the atmosphere of the meeting can be calm in the midst of intense disputes. Among the election methods, there are three points that have caused disputes: The first is the number of chairpersons. The second is the method of production, and the third is the election method. To put it simply, all those who raised objections completely rejected the original draft, such as the number of chairpersons being too small and should be increased, and the method of production should have representatives from each unit. The original draft of the election method specified the use of the non-cumulative voting method, but the opinions put forward unanimously believed that the non-cumulative single-vote method must be used, otherwise it will fall into the manipulation of one way and be undemocratic. Among these speeches, one representative first raised the issue of the duties and tasks of the National Assembly delegates and the need to amend the Constitution. His speech followed immediately after the Provisional Chairman's speech on a delegate's point that the number of chairpersons should be increased. The Provisional Chairman said this: "The number of chairpersons is based on the National Assembly Organization Law passed by the Legislative Yuan. If the number is to be amended, will it still be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedure?" One representative believed that the number of chairpersons must be increased, based on the number of 55 chairpersons in the Constituent National Assembly, and this time it should be increased even more, so why is it reduced instead? At the same time, he shouted loudly, "We want to exercise our powers, we want to amend the Constitution, there are too many loopholes in this Constitution." This first shot aroused the agreement of some people. After that, some people continued to echo his opinion, and Gu Yuxiu also proposed that we must send it to the Legislative Yuan and revise this point. After the Legislative Yuan revises it and sends it back, we will discuss it again. Finally, Pan Gongzhan systematically spoke, specifically criticizing the opinion that some people think that the Organization Law does not need to be revised. He emphasized: We have the right to decide our own affairs, and amending the Constitution is our duty. No one can say that we are not allowed to amend the Constitution. If the Constitution cannot be amended, discussion is okay, and passage is only the secondary issue.

Today, in the agenda document bag of each delegate, there is a small booklet on the basics of civil rights. It tells you that when you have anything you want to do or say at the meeting, first pay attention to the "law" and everything must be legal. When the meeting time was scheduled for 9:00, but the actual meeting time was 9:45, the Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee had to be blamed and asked why the meeting was not held on time and why the work efficiency could not be noticed. However, the Secretary-General and the Provisional Chairman replied that it was to wait for the attendance of delegates to meet the legal quorum.

When the speaking reached 11:30, the Provisional Chairman, in order to request that those who wanted to speak continued to read endlessly, feared that time was limited and hoped that the speeches would be clean. At the same time, he received suggestions from another four or five delegates, requesting that the speeches be stopped and submitted for a vote. But as soon as the Chairman conveyed this opinion, it was immediately opposed. They were almost disorderly, shouting loudly, "Pay attention, in the National Assembly, delegates representing public opinion from all corners of the country need to express their opinions and should not be prevented by anyone. The Chairman has no right to do that." Although the Secretary-General repeatedly explained that this was only accepting the opinions of a few delegates, the waves of opposition still covered everything. Finally, the majority opinion won.

These atmospheres tell us that public opinion is rampant here. No one can resist or prevent it. This is just the beginning, the dispute over the election method of the Presidium is just a flaw!

### Mission of the Legislative Yuan Ends; Must End Affairs by the End of April at the Latest; Farewell Party Will Be Held Regularly

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 30th] After the National Assembly opens, the term of the new Legislative Yuan is not far away. The current President of the Legislative Yuan, Sun Ke, declared after discussing the bill at the regular meeting of the Yuan on the 30th: The National Assembly session can be completed in as little as two weeks according to the scheduled progress. If everything goes smoothly, it will close on April 11. Then, according to Article 6 of the constitutional implementation preparation procedure, the first Legislative Yuan should convene itself on the seventh day after the closing of the National Assembly. The new Legislative Yuan should be formally organized and established on April 18, and the mission of the current Legislative Yuan will come to an end. Therefore, the Yuan must end all affairs by the end of April at the latest. The unfinished cases will be sorted out, reviewed, and processed within half a month. The Yuan is scheduled to hold the 352nd regular meeting on April 15. If there is no need to hold another meeting at that time, a farewell party will be held regularly. Lou Tongsun also reported that the Preparatory Office of the New Legislative Yuan, which is concurrently managed by the Secretariat of the current Legislative Yuan, is actively preparing for the meeting. However, many of the newly elected Legislative Yuan members who have come to Beijing from various places are unfamiliar with the place. According to Hong Guanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly Preparatory Committee, the staff of the Preparatory Committee in various places cannot help but serve the new Legislative Yuan members. Therefore, although Legislative Yuan members are different from National Assembly delegates in that they do not receive salaries, and the problems of accommodation and transportation in the capital during and after the National Assembly session are extremely difficult, the Preparatory Office has no choice but to reluctantly do its best to take care of them. Member Chen Guyuan believes that the current Legislative Yuan members have promoted public opinion and helped the government for many years, and they have made meritorious service. It seems that their post-mortem rewards should be considered. At the same time, he also asked President Sun to give them photos as souvenirs. Member Chen Changheng proposed that the election of the new Legislative Yuan members should be determined and announced as soon as possible so that they can register for the meeting. Finally, members Luo Ding and Liu Guanxun also spoke on electoral politics. The regular meeting on the 30th dispersed after noon.

First, Secretary-General Lou Tongsun read the minutes of the previous meeting and reported that the Yuan's previous recommendations on the Customs Anti-Smuggling Agreement between China and Hong Kong had been ordered by the State Council to be transferred to the relevant agencies for attention and handling. Then, various cases were discussed, including: (1) Amendment to Articles 5 and 19 of the Legislative Yuan Organization Law, (2) Amendment to Article 9 of the Control Yuan Organization Law, (3) Revision of the Implementation Measures for Diesel Import Tariffs and Temporary Surcharges, (4) Amendment to the Salt Tax Rate Table, (5) Amendment to Article 26 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation after Demobilization, (6) Draft Military Service Reward and Punishment Regulations, (7) Amendment to the Civil Servant Disciplinary Law Draft, (8) Amendment to the Civil Servant Disciplinary Committee Organization Law Draft, (9) Amendment to the wording of Article 8 of the Civil Servant Retirement Law, (10) Amendment to the Civil Litigation Cost Law Draft, (11) Examination of the School Teacher Retirement Regulations Amendment Draft, (12) School Teacher Pension Regulations Amendment Draft and other budget proposals. As for the State Council Civil Servant Office's opinion on the constitutional amendment of the election of overseas Chinese submitted for discussion, it was resolved to pass it according to the examination opinion, because the case concerns the amendment of the Constitution, not the amendment of the law, and it is not appropriate to examine it.

Since the preparatory meeting for the U.S.-sponsored Japanese peace treaty was shelved, news of U.S. support for Japan's economic recovery has been pouring in. Most noteworthy are the publication of the Strike Report and the announcement in Tokyo by the U.S. mission led by Army Under Secretary Draper of a plan to rehabilitate Japan. Although the contents of these two major plans differ, they are consistent in reducing reparations, raising industrial standards, and lending money to Japan to help it recover. Judging from the situation, U.S. support for Japan's economic recovery, as a means to contain or as a fait accompli of the peace treaty, has become an established and unchangeable policy. This is a misguided path in U.S. policy toward Japan, bringing endless troubles to Eastern countries.

Now, based on various sources and objective circumstances, we will analyze and criticize the various U.S. plans to support Japan's economic recovery:

First, Raising Japan's Industrial Standards: The issue of preserving Japan's industrial standards is linked to the issue of reparations. Initially, there was the Pauley Reparations Plan, which determined which Japanese industries should be used for reparations and which should be preserved based on the Japanese standard of living from 1926 to 1930; the Pauley Plan had already forgiven Japan's textile industry and merchant ships. The next was MacArthur's compromise proposal, which based the preserved standards on Japanese industries from 1930 to 1934, with the amount of reparations being about 60% to 65% of the Pauley Plan. Later, Strike made a recommendation to the Department of the Army, suggesting that the industrial standards be considered from 1930 to 1950, with the amount of reparations being only 30% of the Pauley Plan. On March 1, the Department of the Army published the "Report of the Foreign Affairs Advisory Association" (also known as the Strike Report), arguing that "all Japanese production equipment, except for basic war industries, should not be removed for reparations." Therefore, it advocated for fewer reparations, believing that reparations are a waste. The content of this plan is even more generous than MacArthur's compromise proposal, reducing it by another 33%.

On March 11, the Far Eastern Commission discussed the plan proposed by the United States, which would preserve Japan's annual production capacity: 2 million tons of pig iron, 3.5 million tons of steel ingots, 2.65 million tons of steel plates, 3.51 million tons of sulfuric acid, 10,000 pieces of machine tool products, steel balls and bearings worth 32.5 million yen. In addition, it would allow for 1.9 million kilowatts of power generation, 1.24 million gross tons of merchant ships and 4.52 million tons of ship repair, as well as 9.8 million barrels of oil refining and 7.29 million barrels of oil storage. If this industrial standard is passed, Japan will leap to become the leading industrial nation in the Far East. Therefore, when the Far Eastern Commission met, Eastern countries opposed it together, especially the strong opposition from the Chinese representatives. On the 20th of this month, U.S. Army Under Secretary Draper arrived in Japan and had lengthy talks with MacArthur and Ashida. MacArthur largely supported this new plan, and Ashida, in addition to thanking the United States, requested continued U.S. assistance in rebuilding Japan to make it the "factory of Asia." Ashida was probably not satisfied with the Japanese productivity stipulated in the Strike Report, so Draper issued a declaration on the 26th, saying: "The United States believes that Japan's own efforts in the future, if indicated, may raise this standard without endangering peace, and it may not be impossible to increase it." What kind of talk is this? It simply forgets that Japan is a defeated country and the solemn provisions of the Potsdam Declaration. If Eastern countries do not fear that Japan's high degree of industry is enough to endanger peace, they should make effective opposition and seek to break the deadlock in the peace conference and complete the peace treaty with Japan. Eastern countries have a belief that they do not oppose Japan's economic recovery, but they oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!

Second, Large-Scale Credit Loans to Japan: Japan's reparations have not been fully fulfilled, and some industrial equipment has not been dismantled. Planned industrial recovery is enough to create a situation that threatens any Eastern country. The "Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan" drafted by the Katayama Cabinet required a large amount of capital to be actively circulated, and the United States showed a strong interest in it. When Ashida Hitoshi came to power, he strived for U.S. aid and requested a loan of one billion U.S. dollars from the Allied Headquarters to implement the five-year plan. According to the Japanese government's plan, if it obtains the credit loan, its industrial standards will be restored to the level of 1930-1934 after the completion of the five-year plan, which is in line with MacArthur's ideal. We do not know what the Allied Headquarters has expressed regarding the Japanese government's loan request. However, several recent facts can point out that the United States has considered and arranged for large-scale loans to Japan. First, the U.S. Congress met and Republican Senator Easland allocated a revolving fund of 150 million for Japan to buy cotton, leather, and raw materials. Second, the U.S. government recently stipulated 275 million yuan for the recovery of Japan, South Korea, and Okinawa, of which about 180 million yuan can be obtained by Japan, which has been submitted to the Congress for discussion and is expected to be passed and implemented. Third, according to news from Tokyo, the U.S. will provide Japan with a loan of 765 million yuan in the next fiscal year (that is, July of this year), including 375 million yuan for social relief, 180 million yuan for recovery, 60 million yuan for cotton loans, and 150 million yuan for trade turnover. This news is a Japanese government probing, but Draper said: The U.S. Congress is considering a plan to make Japan a factory in Asia," which stipulates that 300 to 400 million yuan will be allocated each year to prevent unrest and disease in Japan, and another 180 million will be immediately allocated to revive Japan's economy. Originally, the Japanese government hoped to obtain 765 million yuan to stabilize the fiscal foundation of the Ashida Cabinet in the next fiscal year, but Draper's aid plan is even more magnificent and huge. It is no wonder that Ashida is overjoyed, and the Japanese subjects are like the whole country is free. The Americans laugh, the Japanese jump, and the natural tears are the vast crowd of people who are facing the eve of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and Pearl Harbor.

Third, Stopping the Abolition of Economic Monopoly Plans: Japanese capitalism became imperialism because of its economic monopoly. Therefore, the basic policy of the Far Eastern Commission towards Japan is to eliminate Japanese economic monopoly and dissolve Japanese chaebols and the concentration of economic power. The Far Eastern Commission's efforts over the years have passed various plans for MacArthur to implement, but with little effect. Recently, after debate, the U.S. Department of the Army and the Department of State have decided to abandon the "Plan to Abolish Japanese Economic Monopoly" stipulated in Document 230 of the Far Eastern Commission, arguing that the implementation methods of the original plan were too radical. If this plan is stopped, Japanese economic monopoly will be restored, and the chaebols will not only not be dissolved, but may also re-deploy in coordination with the U.S. policy of supporting Japan's economic recovery. Even the law passed by the Katayama Cabinet to eliminate the concentration of economic power will be revised by Ashida Hitoshi. On the 20th of this month, Ashida attended a Diet session and gave a policy speech, saying that the government under his leadership has no socialist color. This shows that the U.S. policy of supporting Japan has pushed Japanese politics backward. This is not fortunate for the future of Japanese politics, but a disaster.

The above analysis of the three points is only in terms of the outline of U.S. support for Japan's economic recovery. The U.S. Department of the Army's approach seems to be slightly inconsistent with the views of the Department of State, but today's United States is still strategic decision-making, not strategic decision-making. The misguided path of policy towards Japan will eventually have a day of awakening. We read Hull's Memoirs and deeply feel the mistake in the United States' assessment of Japan before the war. As a result, it suffered the disaster of Pearl Harbor. Hull, who was clear-headed and enlightened, had vision and strategy. He could not arouse the attention of the authorities and the military. The lessons are not far away. Why is a clear and powerful "Hull Memoir" not perceived by today's American politicians and strategists? We really can't figure this out.

### Li Zongren Hosts Reporters' Briefing, Reports Northern Situation May Improve; Also Announces Motivation and Position for Vice Presidential Candidacy

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 30th Dispatch] Director of the Peiping Pacification Headquarters Li Zongren hosted reporters at 2:00 PM on the 30th at the Jingjie Hall in Nanjing, announcing his motivation and position for running for Vice President and reporting on the recent situation in the north. Since arriving in Nanjing, Li has repeatedly stated his position and met with reporters separately, but the public reception for reporters on the 30th was the first time. At that time, more than 200 Chinese and foreign reporters attended. Li was wearing a military uniform and smiling from time to time. His wife, Ms. Guo Dejie, also sat next to Li and, at the request of the reporters, expressed her feelings about Li's candidacy. Li first described the situation in the north, saying: Although the situation in the Northeast and North China is more serious, the central government has recently sent a large army to provide support, and the situation is expected to improve. Political and economic measures are also being taken to overcome the crisis. In the future, the primary goal should be to promote a democratic economic policy to stabilize people's lives. Li then continued to state his position on reforming politics, saying that political reform must first start from the central government. If he is elected Vice President, he will assist the head of state in contacting the central leaders to engage in political reform. He explained the motivation and significance of running for Vice President: one is to promote a democratic atmosphere, and the other is to assist the central government and assist the head of state in improving the lives of all people. After Li finished his report, he answered questions from the reporters. Someone asked which of the four vice presidential candidates was the most suitable? Li replied: From my subjective point of view, I am the most suitable. From their subjective point of view, they must also think that they are the most suitable. Someone asked what would be the first thing to do if he was elected? Li replied in a firm tone: The primary task is to eradicate corruption. Asked how to expand the government's foundation, Li said: Personnel should be appointed based on talent. A reporter asked Li's wife about her feelings about Li's candidacy. Li's wife recounted Li's contributions to the country from the Northern Expedition to the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, saying: The country is in trouble, and everyone is responsible. Mr. Li's decision to run at this time is a matter of duty. I did not initially agree with the candidacy, but it was not convenient to prevent him from serving the country and the nation, so I finally turned to support it. I hope that he can retreat, and I also hope that he can succeed.

### Vandenberg's Full Statement

(Continued from the previous page) "The report on the China Aid Bill by the Foreign Relations Committee has created an impression that we did not intend to create, so the report has been withdrawn. Some of the wording does not reflect the will of the committee or its chairman. This was prepared by the committee staff in accordance with routine procedures and was not reviewed by the committee or myself, with the exception of the wording regarding military assistance. On this point, the committee wishes to make it clear that we do not intend to prescribe any obligations for U.S. combat troops, and, like all other foreign aid, we do not intend to prescribe any obligations beyond the scope of existing legislation. This is necessary for all foreign aid, because we cannot accept unlimited burdens."

"But as chairman, I am responsible for the report. Therefore, I have taken responsibility for withdrawing it. I regret this accident. The committee has fully complied with the scope of aid to China requested by the government and has stipulated that some of the grants may be used as military assistance at the discretion of the Chinese government and has quickly voted on the bill. This action has clearly demonstrated the intention of the committee."

"I believe that some reforms in the Chinese government and the basic Chinese economy are clearly necessary for all concerned. The committee has frankly discussed these facts, but I believe that the National Government, in resisting Communist aggression, represents the same position as ours and deserves strong support within the scope of our resources."

"I will clearly state in the Senate that I have great respect for the great and brave President Chiang Kai-shek's great imperial work, his personal integrity, and his continued leadership for democratic ideals in extremely unfavorable circumstances. In addition, I will state that I have always supported and will continue to support his resistance to the armed Chinese Communists and that I have all the hopes and prayers for his success in winning liberation for the free people of China."

### First Furnace of Steel Produced at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 30th] The No. 1 blast furnace of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant of the North China Iron and Steel Company, with a capacity of 250 tons, was ignited at 00:50 on the 26th of this month and began producing iron at 21:00 on the 27th. The process has been very good for the past two days and will officially produce iron on April 1st. However, due to the limitations of raw materials, the daily iron production will be temporarily set at 150 tons as the standard. This No. 1 furnace was completed 20 years ago. At that time, the European war was ending and steel prices were low, so the furnace was not used for iron production after completion. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the capital fell and the furnace was repaired and used by the Japanese. After the victory, it was repaired for two years before being fully completed a month ago. The furnace was then warmed up. In order to commemorate this historically significant project, the factory invited Nian Xintian, the founder of the former iron ore mine, to personally light the furnace at the opening, in order to commemorate this event.

### Petition by Factories Relocated Inland During the War Yields Preliminary Results

President Wang Yunwu Receives Representatives and Expresses Sympathy

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Joint Petition Delegation of National Factories Relocated Inland During the War went to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs on the 30th to petition. The petition yielded some preliminary results. The delegation representatives Wu Yunchu, Li Zhuchen, Li Zushen, Yin Zhizhong, Li Jianting, and others visited President Zhang at the Executive Yuan at 2:00 p.m. on the 30th, where they were received by Wang Yunwu on his behalf. The petition delegation raised three requests: (1) Of the 120,000 tons of Japanese reparations goods originally scheduled to be allocated at a fixed price to private enterprises, it is hoped that 60,000 tons will be sold to the inland relocated factories; (2) Inland relocated factories should pay 10% of the price for allocated goods first, with the remaining 90% to be paid in 18 installments over five years; (3) The price should not be calculated in US dollars at the time of allocation. If it must be calculated in US dollars, the exchange rate should be provided at the time of allocation to convert it into legal tender. Wang stated that the allocation of Japanese reparations goods to private enterprises is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. If the method needs to be revised, the Ministry of Economic Affairs should submit a request to the Executive Yuan for modification, or the Ministry of Economic Affairs should forward the opinions of the petition delegation to the Executive Yuan for review. However, Wang expressed great sympathy for the requests of the inland relocated factories and explained in detail the government's current policy on handling reparations machinery, lasting for more than an hour. At 3:30 p.m., Wu, Li, and others visited Chen Qitian and Division Chief Baochang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Chen indicated that the first two points could be considered and should not pose any difficulties in principle. However, the third point, not calculating the price in US dollars, would be very difficult to achieve. However, the detailed method must be submitted to the Industrial and Mining Division for research and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval as soon as possible. Wu and others also requested Chen Qitian to relay their request to President Zhang, hoping to schedule a meeting so that this issue could be resolved as soon as possible.

### Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Improvement Association Requests Central Government to Ease Silkworm Loans

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 30th] The Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Improvement Management Committee, noting that the spring silk season is approaching, has repeatedly telegraphed the central government, ordering the Four Allied Banks to quickly ease silkworm loans and determine the method of purchasing silkworm cocoons. It is understood that the total number of silkworm loans this year has been approved by the Four Allied Banks as 150 billion yuan, with Jiangsu Province receiving 77.5 billion yuan, allocated to four districts: Shanghai District 23.6 billion yuan, Wuxi District 6.1 billion yuan, Nanjing District 10.68 billion yuan, and Zhenjiang District 7.12 billion yuan, totaling 47.5 billion yuan (handled by the Central Farmer's Bank). In addition, Wuxi has 30 billion yuan (handled by the Central Cooperative Treasury). The funds have been allocated. However, the Provincial Sericulture Improvement Association believes that the silkworm loans are too small and the allocation is unfair. Now, they have telegraphed the Four Allied Banks again, requesting three points: (1) The total number of loans of 150 billion yuan should be increased; (2) The allocation of 77.5 billion yuan to this province seems unfair and should be increased; (3) The allocation figures for each county do not match the actual situation in each county and should be re-adjusted to facilitate progress.

### The Election of the Confucian General He Qian - Cheng Qian

[Our Nanjing Airmail Dispatch, 30th] Director Cheng Qian's participation in the vice presidential election gives us the feeling that Mr. Cheng has a grand demeanor, and the lineup supporting him and campaigning for him is very broad. When he arrived in Beijing by boat from Hankou, the welcoming scene arranged for him by his friends and related parties was also enthusiastic and grand enough.

Mr. Cheng participated in the revolution in his early years and experienced all the battles of the Northern Expedition. During the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Cheng was also a famous general, serving in military positions, either commanding large armies or planning strategies without a day of rest. This time, Mr. Cheng came to Beijing not only to attend the National Assembly, but also to make the vice presidential election his major task. In the few days after Mr. Cheng arrived in Beijing, in addition to meeting at a press conference, the reporter conducted a separate interview to inquire about the current situation and the issue of participating in the vice presidential election.

Mr. Cheng views the current political situation in this way: "I believe that the current difficulties we are encountering in politics and military affairs can be swept away after the implementation of the constitution. The removal of these atmosphere is not only to clarify the situation, but also to increase the hope and trust of the general public in the government."

Regarding his personal election issue, he said: "At this time, quelling the rebellion should really be the first priority; however, due to urging from many parties, I really dare not refuse, but I always think that there is no need for excessive publicity." Mr. Cheng feels that the success or failure of the election is all entrusted to the national representatives, believing that they will have the most prudent choice, and personal success or failure is just a test.

Mr. Cheng believes that the task of the vice president is only to assist the president. Since the written regulations do not define his powers, the greatest task should naturally be to assist the president. Mr. Cheng also humbly said: "If he is fortunate enough to be elected, he will definitely do his best to assist the president and promote the implementation of the constitution. At the same time, he should promote the Three Principles of the People as a major task."

Mr. Cheng is a revolutionary soldier, a figure who commands the wind and clouds, but when mentioning Mr. Cheng's name, few people seem to be able to compare his literary talent and martial arts, or even know that Mr. Cheng is actually a Confucian general. In fact, Mr. Cheng's poems and essays are worth praising, and he has authored a collection of poems. In his poems, we can see his heroic spirit and refined style. These remarkable achievements during his military leisure are worthy of admiration!

Mr. Cheng is from Hubei Province, and the first to support him this time are the people of Wuhan. For Mr. Cheng, Wuhan should be a place of historical significance. Thirty-seven years ago, Mr. Cheng participated in the first uprising. Later, he returned to Hubei twice to hold important positions. Wuhan is a region he is familiar with. After the victory, he also served as the director of the Wuhan Headquarters, and the people of Wuhan have an even deeper memory of Mr. Cheng. Therefore, this time he is participating in the vice presidential election, and the strength of Hubei will definitely be supporting him. Furthermore, since the two lakes are originally one family, Hunan is naturally his territory. In other areas, such as among military personnel, there are many who seize the opportunity to recommend him. Mr. Cheng's view of the vice president is not the most difficult, but he is not doing it because it is "not difficult". Because of being promoted by his subordinates, he came out to participate in the election; it is not for fame, but because he also has self-confidence: if the president is in trouble, he can shoulder this important task and promote the country's major missions. Moreover, those who support him to participate in the election naturally believe in him even more deeply.

### US Announces Aid to Korea; US Garrison in South Korea Increased to 20,000 Troops; US Undersecretary Returns to Tokyo from Seoul by Air

[United Press International, Seoul, 29th] US Under Secretary of the Army Draper, who arrived here three days ago, recently issued a statement through the office of General Hodge, commander of the US occupying forces, stating that the United States is planning a plan for Korea similar to the European Recovery Program. He said that this Korean aid plan was proposed by the Department of the Army, has been approved by the State Department, and has been submitted to Congress. If it can be passed by Congress, Korea will be able to obtain the machinery and parts necessary to increase production, as well as a considerable amount of raw materials. Draper stated that Korea must import more raw materials and raise production levels to establish a sound economy and curb inflation. He said that the purpose of the aid plan is to assist in recovery rather than relief. He also stated that the food situation in Korea has improved greatly compared to last year.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] US Under Secretary of the Army Draper and his party, who departed from Tokyo on the 27th to investigate South Korea, arrived at Haneda Airport at 6:35 PM on the 29th by plane, returning to Tokyo.

[United Press International, Washington, 30th] Well-informed sources revealed on the evening of the 30th that the US troops stationed in southern Korea have increased by about 50% in the past two weeks. Not long ago, the number of US occupying forces was still 13,000, but now it has reached 20,000. This news was revealed just as news came from Seoul that the Soviet Union and the Korean Communists are building large-scale fortifications on the boundary between the US and Soviet occupation zones. However, those in charge here said that there is no connection between these two developments. At the same time, they admitted that the political situation in Korea has been deteriorating in recent weeks, causing the troops under the command of Lieutenant General Hodge, commander of the US forces in South Korea, to be reinforced. One side stated that the army recruitment program lacks effectiveness, so "the number of people needed by Hodge had to be reduced." According to the US Army, it requested to recruit 38,000 soldiers this year, but the budget only stipulated 30,000, and the number of volunteers is still less than this number. Certain American officials here do not intend to express their specific views on the Soviet occupation zone's strengthening of fortifications in news reports. They said that they do not believe that the Soviet Union will adopt such direct and open methods, because this move will soon make the Soviet army itself unable to stay out of the matter. However, they do not deny that the North Korean Communists may, under the orders of the Soviet Union, create border incidents and declare to the North Korean people that this is a southern invasion, further promoting the North Korean army's invasion of the south. The most accurate estimate in Washington is that the Soviet troops occupying North Korea number between 40,000 and 45,000, and the number of Korean Communists under their wing is about 150,000 to 200,000. However, it is generally believed that the construction of trenches is just a psychological posture, intended to show the North Korean people that the US military in the south will launch an offensive, and to make Koreans more supportive of the communist puppet government. At the same time, officials here still believe that the invitation of Kim Gu and other South Korean right-wing figures to Pyongyang on April 14 to jointly discuss the organization of a pan-Korean government "is a smokescreen, aimed at confusing the public or discrediting the South Korean general election on May 9, which is presided over by the United Nations." It is believed here that the trip of right-wing figures to North Korea will benefit them, because after this test, they will probably abandon all hope of reaching an agreement with the northern communists.

### North Korean People Dig Trenches and Gun Emplacements Under the Supervision of the Soviet Army; Construction Concentrated at Essential North-South Transportation Points

[United Press International, US Military Outpost No. 18, North Latitude 38 Degrees, Korea, 29th] Soviet troops and villagers in northern Korea have been digging trenches, foxholes, and gun emplacements near the dividing line between the US and Soviet occupation zones for unknown reasons. According to visitors from the north, the Soviet Union has been propagating to the North Korean people that the US military and the South Korean people intend to attack north latitude, and the order to build the defensive line is intended to prove its truth. This construction was first discovered by US sentries at the beginning of this month, when it was still thought to be a ditch for irrigating farmland. Around March 9, the work intensified, the nature of the work gradually became clear, and foxholes that could accommodate one or two people appeared.

The trenches are six feet deep and are connected by communication trenches two and a half feet deep. The foxholes are ten feet in diameter and are equipped with gun mounts that can accommodate 81mm American-style mortars. It is reported that the construction is concentrated in five mountain valleys that are essential for north-south transportation. The trenches control the highways and railways in each valley. As of yesterday, more than 32 trenches, each 30 to 50 feet long, have been discovered along the 38th parallel, and three or four new trenches are being discovered one after another every day. They first appeared in the western end, and then moved east, bordering the demarcation line, only a stone's throw away from the US occupation zone. There is no activity in the US occupation zone, only sandbags are placed outside several village police stations several thousand yards south of the boundary, on a small scale. Most of the construction in the Soviet occupation zone is being carried out by Korean civilians under the supervision of the Soviet army, and the Soviet army occasionally participates in the digging. When villagers set out to work, they often sing and wave flags, marching in formation, in rows of two or three people. Sometimes they dig trenches at night, and cover them with branches during the day. Recently, they have even appeared openly, not avoiding the eyes of US sentries. Today, sentries used telescopes to observe within 100 yards south of the boundary and caught sight of thirty or forty Koreans, all dressed in white, standing shoulder to shoulder on a mountainside about 2,000 yards away, starting to dig a trench about 50 yards long, taking turns to rest. One or two Soviet soldiers were supervising the work nearby. By the afternoon, the trench was very deep, and the Koreans became very lazy as soon as the Soviet soldiers left. There is a large mountain west of this mountain, on which three trenches have been dug, which are obviously completed, stacked high and low, overlooking the highway, close to the US sentry post. Two border villages have recently relocated entirely to the north, reportedly because the ditch diggers were interfering with their daily lives and farming.

### Korean Committee Resolves That South Korea Shall Hold Elections on Time

Hodge Had Requested a Postponement

[United Press International, Seoul, 30th] The United Nations Korean Committee voted on the 30th, with four votes in favor, three votes against, and one abstention, to hold general elections in Korea on May 9, despite the fact that Lieutenant General Hodge, commander-in-chief of the US forces in South Korea, and the Korean Election Committee requested that the general election be postponed to May 24. Lieutenant General Hodge and the Election Committee stated that voting in remote areas could not be held in time at that time. The United Nations Committee stated that if the United States and the Korean authorities worked hard, this difficulty could be overcome.

### America Will Not Sit Idly By While Free Nations Are Enslaved

### Baruch Supports US Military Preparations; Wallace Criticizes Them

[This Newspaper News] New York 30th Broadcasting: Washington News, today, Third Party presidential candidate Wallace appeared before the Senate Military Affairs Committee to testify, making a lengthy speech, strongly criticizing President Truman's request to implement universal military training, claiming that the Truman administration deliberately created a false crisis to lead the American people to war.

[Reuters, Washington, 29th] Former President Consultant Baruch testified before the Senate Military Committee, urging the immediate implementation of military mobilization, supplemented by industrial and economic mobilization, so that universal military training can be placed at the peak of a solid preparedness foundation. He pointed out that the obligations of the United States require persuading the members of appropriate military forces, so that foreign economic assistance will not be abused, and that the statements of the United States will generate power. To prevent war, it is necessary to strengthen military strength before a crisis occurs. We must never again allow the lack of preparation in the United States to encourage others to launch aggression against the United States or other peaceful countries.

### Soviet-Finnish Treaty Negotiations Reach General Agreement

Mannerheim Arrives in Switzerland for Convalescence

[Reuters, Moscow, 30th] It is believed here that the Finnish delegation has almost reached a general agreement with the Soviet Union on the Soviet-Finnish mutual assistance treaty. Since the start of these negotiations, the progress has not been made public, and both the Soviet and Finnish sides have strictly maintained secrecy, so details are impossible to obtain.

[Reuters, London, 29th] Swiss radio reported that former Finnish President Marshal Mannerheim arrived in Basel, Switzerland today and transferred to Locarno for convalescence.

### US Senator Attacks Marshall's Diplomacy Again; Demands Removal and Replacement

[United Press International, Washington, 29th] Minnesota Congressman Knutson reiterated his demand on the 29th that Marshall should be removed from office immediately. He said that if we want to avoid war, Marshall's removal is absolutely necessary. Because of the critical situation that currently exists in the world, it is essential that the United States' diplomatic affairs should be in the hands of a trained and skilled diplomat. Based on his record of many diplomatic failures, he does not believe that Marshall has this qualification. He said that he is particularly dissatisfied with the results of Marshall's diplomatic mission in China, the Four Powers Moscow Conference last year, and the major changes in the Palestine issue.

### Spain Included in Marshall Plan; US House of Representatives Has Already Approved; Foreign Aid Bill Progresses Smoothly

[This Newspaper News] New York 30th Broadcasting: Washington News, the House of Representatives today passed a resolution, with 149 votes in favor and 52 votes against, inviting Franco's Spain to participate in the $6.205 billion foreign aid plan. The House Foreign Affairs Committee has agreed to include Spain. However, Congressman Voorhis said that the State Department opposes this move. As to whether the Senate will pass the measure is another question. In short, if Spain wants to participate in a European recovery plan, it must, like other participating countries, adhere to the principles of cooperation and self-help.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] The $6.25 billion combined foreign aid bill has now overcome its first major hurdle, as the House of Representatives has refused to accept another provision, a substitute bill for $500 million in direct relief to overseas countries in need of aid. Congressman Goodwin intended to defeat the policy of the Foreign Affairs Committee and specially proposed the substitute bill as an amendment. Although the proposal received support from other Congressmen, it was ultimately not passed. Democratic Congressman Celler once again opposed the combined foreign aid bill, including the military aid to Greece and Turkey section. He also denounced the bill as a despicable political maneuver. Some isolationist Congressmen made efforts at the last moment to stop the House of Representatives from overwhelmingly sympathizing with the combined foreign aid bill, denouncing the bill as a "wolf in sheep's clothing." They also attacked the State Department and other unrelated issues. The House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a recommendation in the proposed amendment, granting the executor of the foreign aid bill the power to veto export licenses issued by the Secretary of Commerce. The amendment would in effect grant the executor of the bill the power to stop any exports that he believes have a significant impact on US security. The Foreign Affairs Committee also shelved another amendment stipulating $220 million in aid for the economic recovery of Japan, Korea, and Okinawa.

[United Press International, Washington, 29th] The Senate is scheduled to discuss the economic and military aid to China bill on Thursday. The Senate has already passed another bill for economic recovery aid to Europe and military aid to Greece and Turkey. Congressional leaders hope that various foreign aid bills can be submitted to a joint conference of the Senate and House of Representatives by the end of this week for adjustment, so as to draft a compromise bill and submit it to President Truman for signature before the Italian general election on April 18.

### Rumor That Molotov Arrives in Berlin and Holds Secret Talks with Soviet Military Commander

[Central News Agency, London, 30th] The British Labor Party's newspaper "Daily Herald" published a report from its Berlin correspondent today stating that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov arrived in Berlin last night and held a secret meeting with his Red Army commander to discuss the Four Powers crisis in the German government. The correspondent further pointed out that Soviet personnel usually have no difficulty in contacting each other by telephone, but they remained silent last night, and a very strong atmosphere of secrecy enveloped the Soviet military headquarters. According to the correspondent, the purpose of this secret meeting seems to be to break the deadlock between the four countries and preserve the four-country control mechanism.

[Reuters, Berlin, 29th] It is rumored here that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has arrived in Berlin, but it has not yet been confirmed. At the same time, the Four Powers Allied Control Council meeting, which was originally scheduled to be held on Tuesday (30th), has not been notified by the Soviet Union to convene after the deadline for issuing the convening notice this afternoon. The Soviet Union is the rotating chairman of the Allied Control Council in March, so it should be convened by it. The United States will be the rotating chairman in April.

### US Senate Passes Legislation to Provide Temporary Aid to Italy and Austria

### Franco's Speech

[United Press International, Madrid, 30th] Today is the ninth anniversary of Franco's occupation of Madrid. Franco gave a speech to 4,500 members of the Falange and broadcast it nationwide. Franco expressed regret that Spain was not included in the US aid to Europe plan, and predicted that one day, Spain and Western democracies "will fight shoulder to shoulder in the same trench." He said that in the world's anti-communist war, Spain assumed its responsibility ten years earlier than Western Europe. Because other countries ignored the lessons of the Spanish Civil War, "twelve European countries are currently gasping under the heavy pressure of the Soviet Union." He said that it is regrettable that some countries intend to divide us" and prevent cooperation between Spain and other countries.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 30th] US Congressman O'Konski submitted an amendment to the House of Representatives to include Spain in the list of countries in the Marshall Plan. The amendment will be voted on on the 30th.

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 29th Dispatch] In the past two days of the United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press, in addition to the Coordinating Committee, which is in charge of the administrative work of the General Assembly, other four committees have also discussed various issues separately. The list of representatives from our delegation attending the various committees is as follows: (1) Chief Representative Zhang Pengchun, attending the Coordinating Committee; (2) Cheng Cangbo, attending the First Committee to study the basic tasks of newspapers, other reporting tools, the principle of freedom of the the press, and other general issues; (3) Deng Youde, attending the Second Committee to study the collection and dissemination of international news; (4) Liu Huoxuan, attending the Third Committee to study the free dissemination and receipt of news; (5) Ma Xingye, attending the Fourth Committee to study legal issues and draft charters. Liu Huoxuan, our representative attending the Third Committee, stated when the committee discussed the abolition of censorship today that China abolished news censorship after the end of the Great War. Democracy is a part of Chinese civilization, and the Chinese people enjoy freedom of speech and publication. Liu also said that we oppose any form of censorship, but if freedom of the press is required, the press itself must be responsible and should have morals.

### A Further Step in the Truman Doctrine; US Plans Military Aid to Europe; Military Lend-Lease Act May Be Restored

[Reuters, Washington, 29th] Restoring military lend-lease measures to the UK and other countries in the Western European alliance has become a topic of discussion among officials and newspapers here. Secretary of State Marshall declined to comment on the matter last week, but said that the French government has repeatedly asked the United States to supply equipment. Some people here believe that the military lend-lease measure is the next stage in implementing the Truman Doctrine. The first stage of the Truman Doctrine was the start of the aid to Greece and Turkey in March last year; the second stage was the proposal of the Marshall Plan; the third stage was the establishment of the Western European alliance; the fourth stage was the United States' resumption of conscription and rearmament; and the fifth stage would be the supply of weapons to Western European countries to fill the vacuum caused by the lack of equipment.

Newspaper speculation is currently focused on military aid to France. Although the French army has 650,000 men, it lacks weapons and equipment. However, French embassy officials said that military aid is still too early before the countries of the Western European alliance have the opportunity to implement the details of their military alliance. Another unconfirmed report said that the US Department of Defense has plans to expand the British Royal Air Force, intending to help it with the latest US aircraft to make it the strongest defense force in Europe.

[United Press International, Geneva, 29th] Martin, chairman of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, today read out the original text of the White House's press control to the Soviet Union at the United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press. The text, which is thousands of words long, subjects all newspapers, periodicals, photography, radio broadcasts, speeches, exhibitions, and films to the full control and restraint of the Minister of Public Education. After reading it, Martin said that a government that imposes such strict, thorough, and decisive control is hardly qualified to criticize the free press of any people. Soviet representative Romakin retorted, accusing American newspapers of attempting to spread obscene texts abroad, which caused the tide of young criminals in the United States itself. British representative Wicknell convened a conference to conclude an international treaty to ensure basic human rights and freedom of the press. The British draft is more detailed than the one submitted by the United States last week.

[Reuters, Geneva, 30th] Soviet Ambassador to France Bogomolov today accused the International Conference on Freedom of the Press of the existence of extremely strong dollar and pound censorships in Anglo-Saxon countries, which are exercised by the giants who own and control the newspapers. Bogomolov's remarks were in response to the remarks made by British representative McGuire at the meeting yesterday. McGuire pointed out yesterday that the fundamental difference between Soviet newspapers and the newspapers of Western democracies is that Western democracies would rather risk being criticized for their policies than take restrictive or repressive measures. As for the Soviet Union and Slavic countries, the opposite is true. They are unwilling to be criticized by newspapers and arbitrarily adopt repressive policies.

### Soviet Jewish Policy

— Special Correspondent of the Central News Agency, Wang Gongda

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Ankara] One of the biggest puzzles in contemporary world politics, and one that people across both hemispheres are pondering day and night, is "Why does the Soviet Union support the partition of Palestine?"

The joint support of the United States and the Soviet Union for the partition of Palestine became the number one miracle of the 1947 United Nations General Assembly. The United States and the Soviet Union are in diametrically opposed positions on every matter, every principle, and every issue. Only on the subject of partitioning Palestine do the United States and the Soviet Union consistently agree completely.

The United States' sponsorship of the partition of Palestine is undoubtedly significant, but within the United States, there is a large group of wealthy Jews whose economic power directly reaches the United States Congress, and their political power directly influences the 1948 United States elections. The U.S. government has seen through the weakness and incompetence of the seven small countries of the Arab world, so it has steeled itself to support the partition of Pakistan. (Note: The U.S. has now changed its position and advocates temporary UN trusteeship.)

The Soviet Union's sudden decision to support the partition of Palestine was initially beyond the expectations of the world, because the past thirty years of Soviet history have indicated many reasons why the Soviet Union would not support this plan. The reasons are as follows:

(1) On the one hand, the Soviet Union believes that the Jewish Zionist movement, known worldwide as "Zionism," is a running dog of British imperialism. The partition of Palestine directly facilitates the realization of the historical efforts of the Jewish "Zionist movement."

(2) For the past three years since the war, the Soviet Union has spared no expense in terms of huge amounts of money and manpower in order to manage the Middle East, striving to befriend the Arabs. Why would the Soviet Union offend the 40 million Arabs who own seven independent countries over the issue of partitioning such a small area of Palestine?

According to the reporter's observation, it can be determined that the Soviet Union's decision is to seek the near rather than the far, to be pragmatic, and to adopt a strategy of capturing the king to catch the bandits. The Soviet Union's decision has profound and subtle reasons, but they can still be inferred.

All the Soviet Union's propaganda towards the Arab world in the past three years has failed to achieve the desired results. The Arabs have deeply believed in Islam for 1,300 years, and Islam and Bolshevism are fundamentally incompatible. Moreover, among the seven independent countries in the Arab world, apart from the two smallest being republics, the rest include three constitutional monarchies and two autocratic monarchies. In other words, power in the Arab world is still concentrated in the hands of a small ruling class. The ruling class regards the Soviet Union as poisonous snakes and fierce beasts, and the Soviet Union cannot expect to make any progress in this regard.

Apart from relying on their belief in Islam as their only spiritual sustenance, the Arab people also have a large number who are nomadic. They do not live in cities, do not read books, do not read newspapers, and do not listen to the radio. Soviet propaganda has virtually no impact on them.

Disappointed, the Soviet Union thought of the Jews, who are ubiquitous, capable of anything, and always the first to take action. The future "Jewish state" will obviously, after its founding, first conquer the Middle East economically, then break through the millennium of slumber in the Middle East politically, and finally become a superpower in the Middle East by force. The Soviet Union decided to use the Jewish state as a stepping stone and the Jews as a vanguard to seize the Middle East. This is precisely the strategy of "capturing the king to catch the bandits."

There is a fact that can prove the progress of the Jews in the Holy Land, which is valued by Moscow's expansionists. As early as forty years ago (1908), when Lenin was in exile in Switzerland, he started the "Spark" newspaper in the Swiss capital, serving as the editor-in-chief, studying Marxism on the one hand and advocating proletarian revolution on the other. At the same time, the Jews in Palestine established the first "collective farm" in history.

As a result of discussions between the reporter and Middle East experts, it was determined that the "Jewish state" in the Holy Land will become the "best conductor" for Soviet propaganda and expansion in the future. In this way, the Soviet Union's decision to abandon its thirty-year-old theory (recognizing Zionists as pawns of British imperialism) and support partition in order to create a "Jewish state" actually has historical necessity.

The Soviet Union is preparing to use Azerbaijanis to split Iran, to use Armenians and Kurds to advance into Turkey, to use Uyghurs to split Xinjiang, and to use Mongolians and Chinese Communists to split China. Now, with a parallel policy, it is using the Jewish people to deal with the "stubborn" Arab people.

For thirty years, the Soviet Union has successfully used a policy of exploiting small and weak ethnic groups to expand its territory, from East Asia through Central Asia to the Baltic Sea, all taking the same steps. The reporter tentatively calls it the "ethnic erosion policy" and seeks advice from domestic scholars on how to name this newest model in the history of aggression. British and American scholars have not yet had time to comprehensively observe this model of erosion.

The Soviet Union created the "Jewish Autonomous Region" in 1928 and renamed it the "Jewish Autonomous Oblast" in 1934. Before the Second World War, there were only 110,000 Jews in the oblast. During the war, 100,000 fled there. Therefore, the current Jewish population in the oblast is only over 200,000, which is equal to 4% of the entire Soviet Jewish population. The rest of the Jews in the Soviet Union still live in the plains from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea and in the "Black Earth Belt" of Eastern Europe.

Jewish parents in the Soviet Union know the uselessness of Yiddish and certainly do not want their children to learn this useless, dead, ancient Eastern European dialect. Jews are also utilitarians created by history. All Jews in Russia speak Russian because they are afraid of imprisonment. Judaism has long been shelved, and the traditional Jewish festivals, rites, and music have all come to an end. Therefore, in terms of blood and culture, the Jews in Russia have been completely assimilated. (The End)

### Italy Determined to Oppose Communism; Premier Urges People to Be Vigilant; Conflict Erupts Between Left and Right Wings in Milan, Atmosphere Tense

[Reuters Dispatch from Rome, 29th] Italian Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi delivered a speech today in the rebuilt town of Cassino after the war, loudly proclaiming that any agreement established by Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito and Italian Communist leader Palmiro Togliatti would cost Italy its independence. De Gasperi also said, "Why doesn't Tito convene a meeting of the Cominform and consult with the Soviet Union to establish a compromise solution, so that the Port of Trieste becomes a factor for peace?"

De Gasperi emphasized, "We do not want Bolshevization, we only want democratization. Without peace, our country's economy cannot recover, therefore we need peace." Referring to Togliatti's statement that he would fight for victory at any cost, De Gasperi pointed out that in countries ruled by the Soviet system, Togliatti's words mean that voters with different ideologies will pay with their blood. De Gasperi also reiterated the words used by the Pope in his speech yesterday, "The vote on April 18th is not a vote of confidence for the government, but a vote of confidence for conscience." He also said that a mistake on April 18th would leave future generations regretting it for the next two or three generations.

### Car Falls into River on the Shanghai-Wuxi Road; Tragedy Strikes the Family of Xi Debing on a Spring Outing

Seven Men and Women in the Car Injured or Killed; Truck Escort Bravely Jumps into Water to Save Mother and Daughter

[Report from this newspaper] A tragic accident occurred on the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway the other day in which a car fell into the river, resulting in seven casualties, as reported in yesterday's edition of this newspaper. It is now known that the vehicle involved in the accident belonged to Xi Jiming, the brother of Xi Debing, Chairman of the Flour Guild of the Fourth District of this city and General Manager of the Fufeng Flour Mill, and former General Manager of the Fabric Bank. Xi Debing is a leading figure in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles and has served as the director of the Central Mint and the general manager of the Fuxing Commercial Company. The other day (the 29th), as it was a holiday, he, his wife, and his wife's eldest daughter Ouyang Meisheng, her son-in-law Lu Hongjun, her youngest daughter Xi Yiyun, Xi Jiming and his wife, and Gu Gengchu, the general manager of the Sichuan Livestock Products Company, took three cars to Changshu for sightseeing. At about 11:00 a.m., they arrived at Chechang Bridge in Shuangfeng Town, Taicang County. The bridge was steep and narrow, with a high degree of inclination on both sides. The car carrying Gu and his family was in the lead and had already crossed. Just as the second car, driven by Xi Jiming, was driving up the bridge slope, a truck with the number Jiangsu Province Recovery Team 10310, loaded with empty oil drums from Zhenjiang to Shanghai, was also driving onto the bridge. Because they were both traveling at high speed, although the truck braked in time, Xi Jiming's car swerved to avoid it, crashed into the southern section of the railing on the east side of the bridge, and overturned into the river below. The current was swift and turbulent, and the car was submerged in an instant. At this time, the third car, in which Xi Debing was traveling, was a little further away. Zhao Xiaofang, a technician from the Recovery Team who was escorting the truck, saw the situation and immediately jumped into the river, groped open the car door, and rescued Xi Debing's wife and her daughter Ouyang Meisheng. They were first sent to Taicang Public Hospital for emergency treatment and were out of danger as of yesterday. When Xi Jiming was rescued, his face was already pale. As he did not improve after emergency treatment, he was sent to Shanghai for treatment, but he died due to lack of timely medical attention. The other four people in the car, driver Zhou Xifu, Xi Jiming's wife Sun Fenglan, Lu Hongjun, and Xi Yiyun, all died after being rescued due to insufficient rescuers. The corpses were examined by the Taicang District Court yesterday and will be transported to Shanghai for burial. Truck driver Xu Chengyu was also detained by the court for questioning.

According to local villagers who witnessed the accident, the driver of the car at the moment it fell into the river appeared to be a young man in a suit, while the driver was sitting beside him. Later, during the rescue, it was discovered that Lu Hongjun was holding the steering wheel. Lu had recently returned from the United States and had not been married for even two years. Unexpectedly, this tragedy occurred. They were riding in a 1947 Studebaker, a new car. After it overturned into the river, the wheels were still turning, and wooden pieces from the bridge railing were embedded in the engine. The car has now been salvaged by personnel sent from Fufeng in Shanghai together with the local police, but it is badly damaged. It is also heard that Xi Jiming and his wife Sun Fenglan did not originally intend to go to Changshu for a spring outing, but because there were still empty seats in the car, they happily took the trip, unexpectedly encountering this accident.

### Labor-Management Judgment Meeting Discusses Two Cases from the Industrial Association; Recommends Increasing In-Kind Allotments; Wage Issues to Be Negotiated Independently

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Labor-Management Judgment Committee held its 18th meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, chaired by Chairman Wu Kaixian, to discuss the Shanghai Industrial Association's request to increase in-kind allotments and rigidly stipulate that wages be paid according to the previous month's index. The following resolutions were made: (1) Request the Social Affairs Bureau to suggest to the central government that it increase the types and quantities of in-kind allotments for workers (i.e., add clothing in addition to rice, coal, oil, and sugar) and reduce the allotment prices in order to stabilize the index and prevent it from increasing drastically month by month. (2) If a factory is unable to bear the burden of the drastic increase in the index or has genuine difficulties in calculating costs, it may negotiate independently between labor and management in accordance with the Shanghai Interim Measures for Wage Adjustment. If no agreement is reached, it may be submitted to the Labor-Management Judgment Committee for judgment.

Rice Allocation Method Passed; The meeting also revised and passed the Shanghai Factory Worker Rice Allocation Method: (1) For factories that provide free meals, workers should submit their rice purchase permits and rice purchase approvals to the factory for purchase. (2) For factories that provide meals on behalf of the workers, the rice allocated to the workers will be purchased by the factory. The calculation of meal expenses should be based on the allocated price. However, if the rice required for meals exceeds the allocation, the excess portion will still be calculated at market price. (3) For workers residing in the factory or whose household registration is handled by the factory but who prepare their own meals, the rice purchase permits and rice purchase approvals will be used by the workers themselves.

### Volunteer Soldiers to Register Starting Tomorrow; Enthusiastic Response to Self-Enrollment; Family Settlement Fee Proposed to Increase to 30 Shi of Rice Per Person

It is learned that the Military Service Association plans to increase the standard family settlement fee for volunteer soldiers to 30 shi of rice per person, to be converted into the market price at the time of enlistment, in order to encourage volunteer soldiers to enthusiastically join the service, so that the required number can be recruited as soon as possible.

### Xu Jizhuang's Trial Continues in Hong Kong; Entire Case May Conclude Within a Week

[Our Newspaper Hong Kong, March 30th] Xu Jizhuang's case opened for trial today. Xu was in the prisoner's cage, sitting next to his lawyer. The trial period has been extended to six sessions, with the last session on the 23rd of next month.

[Central News Agency Hong Kong, March 30th] The Hong Kong Central Court began hearing the extradition case of former Postal Remittances Bureau Director Xu Jizhuang today. After the British prosecutor, Longsdale, made a statement, the judge adjourned the court and will continue the hearing tomorrow. The case is expected to conclude within a week. The prosecutor stated that Xu Jizhuang illegally lent US$1.5 million and 6 billion legal tender under the name of the Postal Remittances Bureau to his privately-owned Bao Chenger Company, which contracted with the United States to purchase US$1.65 million worth of American surplus materials from Okinawa. Bao Weir Company originally deposited US$50,000 and US$260,000 in Victory Bonds with the Postal Remittances Bureau, with the remainder as collateral. However, after part of the loan was paid, Xu allowed them to withdraw it. The prosecutor also stated that Xu colluded with senior officials of the bureau and business tycoons in Shanghai's banking and business circles to commit fraud. It is alleged that Xu embezzled 2.8 billion legal tender on February 22nd of last year and US$50,000 in Victory Bonds on December 29th. Our government is requesting the Hong Kong government to extradite him.

### Mastermind of Chongming Massacre, Former Head of Puppet Detective Agency Lu Maochang Executed

[Our Newspaper] Lu Maochang, the former head of the puppet special agent detective agency in Chongming County, who was previously accused of being a traitor, was sentenced to death by the High Court on August 30, 1946. The Supreme Court subsequently approved the execution and telegraphed the order. After receiving the order, the High Prosecutor's Office sent Prosecutor Qu Rong to the High Court Detention Center in Tilanqiao at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to retrieve Lu. Lu was wearing a black cloth long gown, blue silk pants, white thread socks, and black cloth shoes, and was a burly figure. Prosecutor Qu informed him that he was being executed today and asked if he had any last words. Chen said he needed to write three letters of testament, one to his mother, one to his wife, Defang, and one to the wife of the chief of staff (no name). The writing was grammatically incorrect and incoherent. After he finished writing, the bailiffs handcuffed his hands behind his back and escorted him to the execution ground, where bailiff Weng Yunquan carried out the execution. The bullet entered from the back of the head and exited from the nose, killing him instantly. The time was exactly 2:40 p.m.

It is reported that Lu was introduced by Huang Yaqing, the puppet district chief of Chongming, in May 1940 to work for the enemy's troops under the command of Bushiqiao, specializing in providing intelligence to the enemy. In June of the same year, the Chongming massacre occurred, which was planned by Lu. He also killed Shi Kechang and arrested Cui Zhenxing, who were sent by our side to Chongming to carry out underground work. In order to curry favor with the enemy puppets, he was promoted to head of the puppet special agent detective agency. The High Court sentenced him to death for aiding the wicked and committing heinous crimes.

### Civil Food Regulation Committee Reviews This Month's Rice Allocation Work; Recovered Rice Payments Exceed One Trillion, Suddenly Tightening the Money Supply in the Market; April Rice and Oil Allocation Prices to Be Determined Today

[Our Newspaper] The April rice allocation price in this city will be determined today at 5:00 p.m. in Mayor Wu's office. The final decision will be made by a three-person committee composed of Mayor Wu, Pan Guanghui, a representative of the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling Aid to China Relief Materials, and Ye Shifu, a representative of the Food Department. The announcement will be published in the newspaper tomorrow.

The Shanghai Civil Food Regulation Committee held its twelfth meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m. in the City Government Conference Room. Attended by Wu Kaixian, Zhang Xiaosong, Ye Shifu, Shao Yongsheng, Shui Xiangyun, and more than ten others, the meeting was chaired by Ren Xianqun, chairman of the Civil Food Regulation Committee. The committee conducted a thorough review of this month's rice allocation work and decided on the policy for improving rice allocation next month. Chairman Ren specially hosted reporters after the meeting to report on the meeting's content as follows: (1) The Civil Food Regulation Committee has accurate records of the rise in rice prices in the free market this month, which will be used as a reference when determining the new allocation price for next month. According to statistics, the average price of superior white japonica rice is 3,424,615 yuan, milled rice is 3,000,500 yuan, and brown rice is 2,474,667 yuan. The average price of the three grades of rice should be 2,966,594 yuan. However, the determination of next month's price will not be based entirely on this month's average price. The three-person committee will consider market conditions and economic conditions when setting the price.

160,000 People Waive Rights

(2) Reviewing the results of the March rice allocation work, as of yesterday, the committee issued 4,418,000 large ration cards and 614,000 small ration cards. 264,009 ration cards were returned, so the actual number issued was 4,767,991. This number also indicates that the committee should supply more than 470,000 dan of rice this month. In reality, the total amount of rice distributed to various districts by land and rail this month reached 564,094 dan (including 405,694 dan of domestic and Burmese rice, and 158,400 dan of over-supplied rice from the Food Bureau). As of the deadline on the 26th of this month, a total of 460,658 dan and two dou had been sold, so there are currently 103,435 dan and eight dou remaining. The above figures indicate that more than 160,000 people in this city obtained rice ration cards but waived their rights, accounting for more than 3% of the city's total population.

More Payments Collected, Higher Shadow Interest Rates (3) The total amount of rice payments collected by the National Bank this month was 1,050,300,857,440 yuan. Based on the experience of the past month, the Civil Food Regulation Committee confirmed that the income from rice payments is closely related to the shadow interest rates in the market. The more payments collected, the higher the shadow interest rates. According to this month's statistics, since rice payments reached 500 billion yuan on March 8th, shadow interest rates began to rise. By March 25th, when payments reached 900 billion yuan, shadow interest rates had even exceeded 30%. Therefore, the Civil Food Regulation Committee hopes that citizens can purchase rice earlier in the month starting next month so that the National Bank can obtain rice payments earlier, tighten the money supply, and achieve the effect of suppressing prices.

Penglai District Has the Most Rice Shops (4) The distribution of rice shops in various districts of the city varies. According to the survey results, Penglai District has the most rice shops, while Xinshijie District has the fewest rice shops. Due to high rents, a large population, and few rice shops in Huangpu District, each rice shop needs to supply an average of 6,529 people, while each rice shop in Sisheng District only needs to supply 869 people, resulting in overcrowding at some rice shops. In order to improve this situation, the committee has decided to determine the amount of rice allocated based on the supply ratio starting next month to avoid overcrowding. (5) The April rice allocation has been gradually sent out. As of today, all 29 districts in the city can be reached, with only Xinjing District possibly being delivered tomorrow.

Eight Rice Shops with Unsettled Rice Payments (6) There are eight rice shops that have not settled rice payments to the National Bank of China for March: Dafeng Rice Shop in Zhenru District, Huaxingshun Rice Shop in North Railway Station District, Yongsheng Rice Shop at the end of North Sichuan Road, Shenxiangtai Rice Shop in Jiangwan District, Yuantaihing Rice Shop in Jingan District, and Maotai Fengji Rice Shop, Quanfutai Rice Shop, and Dalongzhongji Rice Shop in Changshu District in Yangjing District. Starting in April, rice allocation to the above rice shops will be suspended first, and a letter will be sent to the Financial Management Bureau to investigate the responsibility and transfer the case to the court for handling.

Oil Rationed per Capita, Set at 12 Ounces In addition, the meeting decided on the following matters: (1) The units responsible for household rice allocation (including rice industry, social service centers, and cooperatives) will await the deliberation of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. (2) The deadline for the second phase of rice allocation for industrial workers will be extended by ten days to April 12th, in accordance with the regulations, and a public announcement will be made in the newspaper. (3) The third phase of coal briquette allocation for industrial workers will be based on the number of people allocated rice in February. If any industrial units have applied to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to change their registration, the Social Affairs Bureau will notify the committee for handling.

Regarding the per capita allocation of cooking oil, it was decided that starting in April, it will be handled in accordance with the various established rules for rice allocation. Regardless of age, everyone will be allocated 12 ounces uniformly. Citizens will automatically choose an oil shop to purchase from. The oil allocation price will also be determined at 5:00 p.m. today, at the same time as the rice allocation price. Those who have not paid their oil payments for April will have their oil allocation suspended in April.

### April Allocation of American Rice, 15 Jin and 10 Liang per Dou

It is learned that the city will allocate and sell American relief rice in April. Each municipal stone will weigh 156 municipal jin, which means each municipal dou will weigh 15 jin and 10 liang, which is 10 liang heavier than last month. The authorities still plan to maintain the rice allocation price for students in April at 800,000 yuan per municipal stone to show preferential treatment.

In addition, the Civil Food Regulation Committee is currently allocating public addresses incompletely. It has found a new address at 7725 Nanjing West Road. Yesterday, the Sales Supervision Office, Audit Office, News Department, and Purchasing and Transportation Department moved to the new address to work. The Allocation Department will also move there after completing its backlog of cases. The office address of the committee's chairman will be located on the third floor of the Central Bank.

### Wife, Jealous of Husband's Affection, Hires Fellow Townsman to Kill; Woman Chopped to Death in Tianbao Road Field; Case Solved in Three Hours, Two Criminals Arrested

[Our Newspaper] Chen Hongda, a native of Jiangbei, is currently a squad leader in the Hongkou District Office and resides at 42 Qimei Road. He married Wei Qingzhu, a fellow townsman, in his hometown of Lincheng. They have children. Later, Chen met Yang Huiqing, a woman from Dongtai, and cohabited with her at his home on Qimei Road. It is reported that Chen's first wife, Wei, recently came to Shanghai from her hometown due to unrest in the countryside and rented a thatched shed in Dade Lane on Gaoyang Road. Witnessing her husband's close relationship with Yang, she became consumed by jealousy. She paid Yan Zhaohong, a fellow townsman, 3 million legal tender and gave him an ax. At approximately 9:25 p.m. on the 29th, taking advantage of the darkness and sparse pedestrian traffic, she lured Yang Huiqing to a wheat field on Tianbao Road and used the ax to chop her head more than ten times. Yang cried out for help in extreme pain. Passersby heard the cries and reported them to the Tilanqiao Police Station. Deputy chiefs Huang Yinglong and Wang Xiwenzhen immediately ordered section chief Ma Zhuyu to lead section members Lin Jiyun, police chief Gong Tinghe, and others to rush to the scene. They found the woman's body in the wheat field, with more than ten ax wounds all over her body, a bloody mess. Her body was already stiff. An ax was left beside the body, and a letter was found in her pocket. Based on this clue, they rushed to 42 Qimei Road to investigate and learned that the deceased was Chen's concubine. They then investigated and found that Chen's first wife resided in a thatched shed on Gaoyang Road and believed that she was related to the case. They immediately went to investigate and found a letter from Yan Zhaohong in her pocket. She was immediately arrested. They then went to Yan Zhaohong's residence and found shoes stained with blood and two pieces of blood-stained clothing. He was arrested and interrogated. He confessed to the crime and revealed the whole story. The case was solved in about three hours from the time it occurred to the time it was solved, which can be said to be very fast.

Jiang Lin learned of this and also learned that Chen had hidden some property. He asked Wang Qianli to write a confidential report while impersonating an employee of the Municipal Government Investigation Office. He threatened and extorted Chen over the phone. Chen sent Qian Dianchen to negotiate, and Jiang demanded 6 billion yuan, saying that if he received the reward for the confidential report, he could get at least 1.5 billion yuan. Chen suspected his situation and checked with the Municipal Government Investigation Office and found that there was no such person. He realized that Jiang was impersonating a public official to extort money. Chen feigned compliance and agreed on 400 million yuan and reported to the police bureau. Jiang was arrested when he received the money, and Wang Qianli, who wrote the report, was also arrested. They were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday.

### Prison Guard Embezzles, Sheng Ziqiang Tried Yesterday

However, both prisoners had no money on them, so they wrote notes to their families, instructing Sheng to go to the prisoners' homes to collect the money. Yao Deyun also asked Sheng to bring three injections of 606 medicine to his home. After the notes were written, Sheng went to the prisoners' homes, demanding 1 million yuan for each as a year-end bonus, and brought three injections of 606 medicine. However, Sheng embezzled the money and medicine. The Shanghai Prison authorities quickly learned of this and detained Sheng, transferring him to the local court for trial on charges of corruption. The case was publicly tried for the first time in the Criminal Court No. 8 by Judge Mei Erhe yesterday. The defendant pleaded guilty in court, but claimed that it was only for safekeeping and that he did not embezzle it.

### General Chennault on American Policy Toward China

Copyrighted by Scripps-Howard Newspaper Alliance. Translated by this Newspaper's Translation Department.

(4) The Strange Phenomenon of 1944

If America's policies during the war against Japan had achieved their stated goals in China, there would be no question of helping China resist Communism now. China would have already become Communist.

I am not saying that this was our direct and intended purpose in China, but I sincerely believe that this would have been the logically inevitable result.

The main point of the policy implemented by the United States in our military alliance with China over these three years was to increase the demands on the Chinese central government, reaching a peak in 1944, almost to the point of forcing this government to step down.

At the same time, those implementing our policy were constantly engaging in a kind of "open flirtation" with the rebellious and autonomous Chinese Communists, hoping to arm them with American weapons and bring them to fight the Japanese in the Chinese areas of the National Government—at a time when the commander of the Chinese National Army was not lacking manpower but was demanding American weapons and ammunition.

And there was news that the Communists had expressed a willingness to hand over the direct command of the Communist forces to our theater commander, General Stilwell. This news was not obtained within the scope of my official duties, but it is reliable. If the Communists had indeed offered such a plan, I have no doubt about their ultimate secret purpose, which was nothing more than to seize power in the Chinese areas of the National Government.

This was the unfortunate situation in September 1944 before Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek rejected America's final and greatest demand, forcing the United States to recall Stilwell. For nearly three years, Stilwell had constantly and firmly demanded that the Chinese army be completely managed by American officers, up to the rank of colonel.

As far as I know and believe, apart from Stilwell's strong desire to open a land route through Burma, this well-conceived plan was a good example of the long-term planning initiated by Stilwell and his staff.

We will talk about the failure or lack of planning of American military planning in China, and the crisis caused by American demands, later. For now, let us consider the phenomenon of the so-called "open flirtation" between the American command in Chongqing and the Chinese Communists.

In 1944 and before, the Communist Party of China in the so-called "border region" of northwestern China established a delegation in Chongqing as a superficial cover for cooperation with the anti-Japanese central government. In fact, this delegation was little more than an intelligence-gathering agency and a propaganda center.

Until after the day of victory over Japan, American planners began to use this agency to conduct negotiations aimed at incorporating the Chinese Communist Party into the central government. Before that, the main task of the Communist delegation seemed to be news liaison work. Although it has never been publicly stated, the press's attacks on the "dictatorial" central government mostly came from the Communist delegation in Chongqing, which is an ironic commentary.

In addition to this bizarre method, the American theater staff later added another—that is, the establishment of an American military delegation in Yan'an. The only possible defense for this action is to provide military intelligence in an area that itself clearly lacks military intelligence.

But the American delegation in Yan'an did more than just provide intelligence. It made it easier for the Communist Party to learn about our military measures and allowed American journalists and State Department personnel stationed in our theater staff in China to go to Yan'an from time to time to promote the Communist Party's claims.

With the convenience of air traffic between the Chongqing theater command and Yan'an, it was quite easy for anyone to travel to this Communist Party exhibition area with a suitable excuse. In the past, the Chinese government has always disapproved of such unofficial contacts, especially contacts with journalists, but at that time there was very little way to interfere.

If the American delegation in Yan'an was indeed a source of valuable intelligence, this intelligence was really lacking in confidentiality. If the confidentiality of this intelligence was necessary, I feel that there is a gap between reality and necessity.

An officer reported to me that when he went to the Chongqing press conference once, he learned that the Communist Party quite "liked" Stilwell to lead their army. If this report is correct, it is surprising that such a delicate matter cannot be kept a little secret, to an extent no less than the intelligence itself.

If one wants to argue that the American delegation in Yan'an does provide convenience in intelligence, then Stilwell's successor, Wedemeyer, believes that this agency is not needed, which is a sharp rebuttal. I suspect that the significance of this delegation is not limited to putting more pressure on Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, although the delegation and its jointly cultivated pro-Communist and anti-Chiang rhetoric undoubtedly provided assistance and comfort to thorough Communists.

At that time, there was a joke circulating in Chongqing that the American command staff was drafting "a private foreign policy, with John Davies (a staff member of the State Department stationed at Stilwell's command) as Secretary of State."

In 1944, another unhealthy argument in American policy in Chongqing was seen in the various rumors about American embassy staff member Jack Service and others, who were accused of passing important confidential documents to Communist sympathizers. Service was later declared innocent.

But before this happened, a lower-ranking staff member of Stilwell's staff had said that the charges against Service were creating a "second Tukhachevsky Affair." He predicted that Service's defense would be to establish an argument that he was only implementing "old pressure" on the Chongqing government according to Stilwell's policy.

### Chinese Ski Troops in Swaddling Clothes

[Report from this newspaper in Dihua on the 24th by airmail] While the peach blossoms are red and the willows are green in the Central Plains, the high-pressure cold air from Lake Baikal has added more spring snow to the silver-clad northern Xinjiang. What beautiful spring snow on the tidal sea! It was during this snow flurry (on the morning of March 7th) that more than 300 people, the second batch of ski cadres trained by the Fifth Military Officer Training Class in Dihua, graduated.

Six Weeks of Ski Training. This batch started on January 28th of this year and trained for six weeks. The first batch started on November 24th of last year and graduated on January 12th of this year. In total, more than 710 ski cadres have graduated and become junior and mid-level officers in the garrison troops in northern Xinjiang and the Hexi Corridor.

During the six weeks of training, they need to learn some knowledge of snow and extreme cold warfare. They must learn various ski skills, such as "straight downhill," "diagonal downhill," "mountain skiing," "cross-country skiing," "snowplow skiing," as well as "falling," "obstacle crossing," and "sledge marching." As for various patrol and shooting methods in the snow, as well as shooting and destruction techniques while skiing, they must lay the foundation in these six weeks. They are not only skilled but also technically proficient, and they can train their subordinates when they return to various troops. It is reported that many soldiers in the National Army stationed on Beita Mountain are learning to ski. Therefore, we can say that the Dihua Officer Training Class is the cradle of Chinese ski cadres, and the new Chinese ski troops will gradually grow up from swaddling clothes.

Not only Xinjiang, but also the whole of China, had never had ski troops in the past. Although ski instruction was held when Japan occupied the Northeast, and the government continued to do so after the victory, there was no expansion or large scale. Therefore, running ski training in Xinjiang can be said to be completely without precedent, and everything depends on self-creation.

Prices, Equipment, and Teaching Materials. According to the reporter, the people in charge of this ski training are really racking their brains. There were no finished products for various ski equipment, and there were no workers specializing in manufacturing such tools. So, they had to use local materials and use workers who had repaired snowboards in the past to manufacture according to the drawings. In a very short period of time, various tools such as "skis," "poles," and "sleds" were enough for more than 400 people in a class to train skiing. Secondly, there was the problem of instructors. Since the Ministry of National Defense could not send anyone, and there were no such experts to hire in the interior, they had to select some skaters or people who had learned to ski in the past (in cold regions, skiing and skating are sister sports loved by the general public in winter), and then refer to books to study, learn, and correct them, and solve the problem of instructors in a crash course manner. And of course, there are no such books in China, relying on only a few foreign reference books, requiring them to be adapted to the environment of Xinjiang, compiled and translated, and then printed and distributed. Now, books such as "Snow and Extreme Cold Warfare," "Training of Ski Troops," "Use of Ski Troops," and "Cold Region Warfare and Training" are almost available to every trained ski cadre.

Once, when the reporter went to see General Yi Jin, who was in charge of the actual training—the deputy director of the officer training class—he specifically pointed out that the difficulty in running ski training was the problem of three materials—talent, equipment, and teaching materials, which were the most difficult to solve but must be solved. And they finally overcame these subjective and objective difficulties in the spirit of Whampoa and skied through this road themselves!

Logging and Manufacturing Tools. Now is the time when spring is approaching and the snow is melting. Once winter arrives and every winter thereafter, it will continue to be held, and there is no doubt that the scale will be expanded and the training will be more advanced. It is reported that they are currently logging wood in Nanshan, which will be processed and manufactured into ski tools by local arsenals to prepare for winter training this year and distribution to various troops. Why did Chairman Chiang personally order the local military academy to run ski training? We can very reasonably realize this reason: in Xinjiang, north of 43 degrees north latitude, winter lasts for four or five months, and the temperature difference between day and night is as large as ten to fifteen degrees Celsius, and the cold is biting. Still remembering the winter of the 33rd year, when the National Army first entered Xinjiang, they encountered unprecedented extreme cold, so that many soldiers were "half dead from artillery fire and half died on the side of the road." This is a vivid historical lesson; and in order to strengthen the national defense line of the continental cold zone, in order to overcome the difficulty of marching when the snow is more than 30 centimeters thick and infantry, cavalry, and even armored tanks cannot move, although the Changbai Mountains and the Xing'an Mountains have the natural conditions for training ski troops, they are still in a state of constant warfare. Therefore, the area between the Tianshan Mountains and the Altai Mountains is the best place to train ski troops.

Snow Gang Exercise Results. It was a day of wind and snow, and the first ski training class had an exercise. The local military leaders were invited to visit, and the reporter also rushed to enjoy a visual feast, praising each and every one of the national defense athletes. General Song Xilian, the military commander of the entire Xinjiang and the director of the officer training class, also showed a satisfied smile from time to time.

The exercise site was on the side slope of Snow Gang. The first subject was "straight downhill," which is a basic method for rapid movement when encountering mountain side slopes. Then, "diagonal downhill," "mountain turning," "obstacle crossing," "straight downhill with guns and objects," and "falling with guns and objects" were performed one by one, becoming more and more exciting. Even more tense was: "Bang!" The downhill shooting performance began again. This is where the ski students wear "ski boards" on their wrists with "poles," hold guns in both hands, load the chamber, aim and shoot, and eject the cartridge, while descending on a slope of twenty or thirty degrees! "Snap! Snap!" Light machine gun downhill shooting was also practiced. Although there were only hypothetical defeated people, the situation was tense enough, and my heart was beating "thump! thump!" It is said that the technical skills of the cadres trained in the second phase are even more advanced, and they can ski on one foot, and cross-country ski for more than 50 minutes and ski more than 8 kilometers!

In order to increase the interest of cadres in learning to ski, General Song Xilian once tried skiing on the snowfield, but unfortunately fell and dislocated his left arm, which took more than half a month to heal. Although this gave General Song physical pain, it gave the national defense athletes on the snowfield unparalleled inspiration!

Two Ski War Histories. After visiting the exercise, I embarked on my return journey. On the way, I silently thought about the sister sports of skiing and skating. My mind was dancing, wishing that all our men would jump into the snow and wilderness. I thought of the fact that it is now the Arctic era, and when everyone is going north, the continental border of our national lifeline is in the cold zone. I suddenly remembered two ski war histories:

During the First World War, Germany fought France. Originally, it wanted to attack from the south through Switzerland and from the north through Belgium. Later, the German Emperor traveled to Switzerland and saw the Swiss people skating and skiing, moving quickly, while Germany had no such training at all. Therefore, Germany abandoned its plan to attack France through Switzerland.

On November 30, 1939, the Soviet army began to attack Finland's Nai Karri Lien Ismathu. The Finnish army laid out "winter roads" and used ski troops to attack the Soviet army at any time. By mid-January, the war ended. The Soviet army suffered a total of 36,000 deaths, and all supplies were captured by the Finnish army. The Finnish army only had 2,000 participants, and the total number of deaths was only 150. This is the miraculous feat of the ski troops. (Mei Ran)

### Passengers Stranded in Taiwan Selling Belongings to Return to Fujian

[Report from this newspaper in Fuzhou on the 30th] In recent months, maritime traffic between Fujian and Taiwan has been cut off from time to time, especially in the past month. About 1,200 passengers stranded in Taipei and Keelung waiting for ships to return to Fujian. They have been waiting for a long time and have no way to make a living, so they are selling their belongings to pay for travel expenses. Yang Shounian and other passengers on this trip of the "Yinghang" ship to Fuzhou specially invited reporters from Fujian Province to appeal for speedy improvement.

### Main Culprit in Dayong Massacre, Tian Mingyuan, Has Gone to the Mountains

[Report from this newspaper in Changsha on the 25th by airmail] Lake Province Committee member Wang Yuying and others were previously sent to Dayong to thoroughly investigate the Huang Yingchuan massacre. The matter has been completed, and they returned to Changsha on the 25th. After Wang arrived in Changsha, he received a telegram from Liu Yinggu, Chief of Staff of the Wuhan Headquarters, summoning him to Wuhan to discuss important matters. Without even warming his seat, he took a car to Wuhan.

Wang's trip to Yong lasted more than 20 days. Regarding the investigation, he is drafting a detailed report. The main point is that on the day he arrived in Yong, he immediately tried his best to restore local order. He ordered that the assembled militia and civilian guns be disbanded by March 13th. Initially, a small number of armed forces remained in the area five miles from the city, waiting to see what would happen. After strict orders to comply, the militia returned to farming and the civilian guns were disbanded in December, and the order of the entire county was immediately restored, and all agencies resumed normal operations.

As for the main culprit in the massacre, Tian Mingyuan, before Wang and others arrived in Yong, he had already fled in fear of punishment with more than ten guns. Later, he joined Wu Zhengqiu, the main instigator of the incident, and dragged away more than 70 civilian guns, and fled with him to Yian Township in the county, joining the giant bandit Feng Ying, and partnering with Liang Yongqing, the bandit leader of Yongshun. Currently, they have hundreds of people and guns, lurking in the triangle area in the mountainous area bordering Yongshun, Sangzhi, and Dayong. The garrison security forces have been ordered to actively suppress them.

Wang finally said: Although the general order of the county has been restored to normal, those with civilian guns are still guarding against each other, so the hidden dangers that they have suffered before are of great concern. Wang said that he has ordered the new county magistrate Liu Xin to personally inspect the townships and towns, and earnestly promote the removal of the source of chaos.

### Because of "Haunted House No. 13," Descendant of Prince Zheng Sues for Defamation

[Report from this newspaper in Beiping on the 29th] The film "Haunted House No. 13" has caused a storm because its plot involves the death of the descendant of Prince Zheng of the late Qing Dynasty and his son. Zhao Xu, the descendant of Prince Zheng, now renamed Jin Shaoxun, inherited the title of Prince Zheng. In the 10th year of the Republic of China, Wang Zhengting returned the Xishiku debt on behalf of his mansion in Xinpi Ku Hutong, Xicheng. The mansion belonged to China University. According to the value, there was still a surplus. Jin also donated to China University, and the school hired Jin as a school director. According to Jin, "Haunted House No. 13" describes Prince Zheng's Mansion, pointing out that Prince Zheng's Mansion is a haunted house, and most of the facts are fabricated and deliberately defamatory. Jin has hired lawyers Liang Qiyao and Kuai Jinfu to request a ban on the screening from the relevant parties and file a lawsuit in accordance with the law. The North China Service Office of China Electric has also hired a lawyer to protect its rights.

### Communist Bandit Li Yun Surrenders and Broadcasts

[Report from this newspaper in Changsha on the 26th by airmail] Communist bandit Li Yun, from Suqian, is 35 years old this year. He joined the Communist Party in the 16th year of the Republic of China. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he was transferred to work in Hunan, serving as the special commissioner of the pseudo-Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist bandits and other important positions. In June of last year, the bandit sneaked back to his hometown of Suqian. At that time, Suqian had been occupied by the Communist bandits. Li witnessed all kinds of cruel, terrorist, dark, and hypocritical atrocities of the Communist bandits, and he suddenly repented. He then surrendered to the Hunan Provincial Government and broadcasted "Eyewitness Accounts of the Pseudo-Liberated Area" on the Hunan Broadcasting Station, exposing the crimes of the Communist bandits.

### Bandit County Magistrate Wearing Mourning Clothes, Dismissed After Being "Purged"

[Report from this newspaper in Nantong on the 28th] The Communist bandits launched the "Three Investigations" and "Eight Comparisons" of the "Party Rectification" work. Their cadres took advantage of the "struggle" power of the poor and hired peasants to exclude, squeeze out, and kill each other. Qu Shuzi, the county magistrate of the Communist bandit Nantong County, was reviewed by more than 1,000 people on January 11. Because of his landlord background, and because his mother had demanded rent from tenants, and Qu had worn mourning clothes after his mother's death, the "struggle meeting" also mentioned this matter, saying that he had not been able to be of one heart with the poor. After "review," it was decided to remove him from the post of county magistrate.

### The Bodies of Ma Yuqi and Two Others to be Buried in the Wuxi Christian Cemetery

[Report from our newspaper, Wuxi, 29th] Ma Yuqi, the leader of the Sanitary Engineering Brigade of the Ministry of Health, was traveling from Wuxi to Suzhou in his own jeep at 1:00 PM on the 28th when he overturned into the river at the 11th bridge on the Su-Xi Highway and drowned. Mr. Ma, his younger sister Mingxia, his daughter Qiying, and Zhai Xiang, an engineer from the brigade, totaling four men and women, were involved in the accident. After the incident, Ma's wife, Hong Yuying, and eight other survivors jointly telegraphed Jin, the Vice-Minister of the Ministry of Health, requesting him to send personnel to Wuxi to handle the aftermath. At the same time, Ma's wife also telegraphed Lan Chunlin, the manager of the Shanghai Jiaotong Bank, who was a close friend of Mr. Ma. Upon receiving the telegram, Mr. Lan immediately came to Wuxi at 8:00 PM that evening to meet with Ma's wife. He also obtained the consent of Vice-President Zhang of Puren Hospital to borrow an ambulance from the Yishou Sanatorium and went to the countryside to transport the bodies of Mr. Ma and his two daughters to the city, where they were placed in the mortuary of Puren Hospital.

### Cultural Relics, Old Books, Writing Brushes

— Zhu Ziqing

In recent months, in addition to news of wars, murders, and education crises, the crisis of old books has also been a lively news topic in the newspapers of Peiping. Furthermore, the cultural relics of Peiping, mainly ancient buildings, have always been valued. The government has established a Peiping Cultural Relics Preservation Committee and has allocated several not insignificant sums to repair these relics. In early February, this committee also held a meeting and decided, in order to adapt to Peiping's long-term plan as an auxiliary capital, to request the government to "approve the first half-year's budget" and "strengthen the management and use of cultural relics buildings to maintain ancient sites." As for writing brushes, the Ministry of Education stipulated many years ago that students must use writing brushes for Chinese composition and for answering examination questions in Chinese. However, in reality, students rarely use writing brushes, especially in large cities. This issue still seems to be pending. In the author's view, cultural relics, old books, and writing brushes are all of a piece; they are all legacies, history, and old culture. Those who advocate preserving these things inevitably have some "ancient sentiments," and on the one hand, they also inevitably have some sense of "preserving national essence." "Preserving national essence" now seems to have become a bad word, equivalent to "clinging to remnants and defending shortcomings," "being inflexible with the ancients," "being infatuated with bones," and "letting the dead hold back the living." The author also knows that most of those who advocate preserving these old things today are figures from the May Fourth era and would no longer have such stubborn thoughts, and the author himself shares their feelings to some extent and does not consider himself to be so stubborn. However, upon careful analysis of the reasons for this advocacy, apart from "ancient sentiments," it seems that one can only say that it is "preserving national essence," because these things are the excellent achievements of our ancestors and are therefore worthy of preservation, and they will also evoke our nostalgia. What distinguishes us from the older generation should be that preservation is only for preservation's sake, allowing these things to be like fossils, no longer妄想them to revive. What should pass will always pass, and we understand this principle.

Regarding the allocation of large sums of money to repair and paint the ancient buildings of Peiping, there has been criticism in one newspaper, seemingly saying that in this era of war and famine, one should not be busy with these things to whitewash peace. Originally, if there were genuine peace, this renovation might also attract some foreign tourists and obtain some foreign exchange to use. Now, in these times, that glorious scene is only a strong contrast, a strong irony, to the reality of war and famine, which does indeed make people feel a little shocked. This is naturally a utilitarian view, but in these times, there are too many people without clothes and food, and a utilitarian view is also natural. However, having said that, there is no comprehensive plan for the use of public funds now. If this money is not used here, it probably will not be used for those who are without clothes and food, and it may even be used for some irrelevant things. In that case, using it to preserve antiquities is not so bad. If it were truly possible to plan comprehensively and distinguish between priorities, this kind of thing should probably be postponed. Although the author also agrees with preserving antiquities, he does not have the intention of rescuing them. Logically, it is not too late to preserve antiquities after having enough food and clothing; if it is too late, it can only be regretted, as food and clothing are always fundamental. The author disagrees with excessively emphasizing the preservation of antiquities, excessively emphasizing Peiping as a cultural city, but "strengthening the management and use of cultural relics buildings to maintain ancient sites" does not require spending much money and is the right thing to do.

The crisis of old books refers to woodblock books, especially large volumes. The old book business has been very depressed for the past year, and some shops are selling large volumes of woodblock books by the pound to make 還魂 paper. This is naturally very regrettable and a bit tragic. Therefore, some scholars have come out to call for rescue. Now the Ministry of Education has allocated 1 billion yuan to purchase these old books, and rescue has already begun, which is naturally very good. However, the author wants to point out that the crisis of old books has been lurking for a long time and is not sudden. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, lithographic editions of ancient books were popular, which were convenient to carry and reasonably priced. This was really the beginning of the crisis of old books. However, at that time, lithographic editions were not considered elegant; it was said that there were many typos, which was true, but the main reason was that they lacked the antique charm. Therefore, adults and gentlemen did not patronize them. However, after all, they were reasonably priced, convenient, and did not take up shelf space, so general scholars, especially young people, were happy to buy them. Since the Republic of China, there have also been photographic reprints of books, and large volumes such as the Sibu Congkan were almost all based on good editions, and photographic reprints did not have typos or lack antique charm. This had an even greater impact on the sale of old books. Later, the Sibu Congkan also had micro-reprints, which had less antique charm but were even more convenient. There were also typeset editions of ancient books, such as the Sibu Beiyao and the Wanyou Wenku, which were also convenient and reasonably priced. And like the Guoxue Jiben Congshu, which followed some of the lithographic methods and punctuated the sentences in the books, it was even more convenient. Before the War of Resistance, there were also so-called "80% discount books," which were typeset with not too many errors, were extremely cheap, and circulated in large quantities, and many young students patronized them. Compared with the earthen paper books during the War of Resistance, these 80% discount books have now become good editions. Today's young students often prefer these typeset editions to woodblock editions; they want convenience and do not care about the antique charm. Since people who buy large volumes of books can buy photographic reprints or typeset editions, people who buy single volumes of books are even more happy to buy typeset or lithographic editions. The innovation of art has destined the decline of woodblock books! In the future, when micro-film books are developed, the current photographic reprints and typeset editions of large books will also decline, right?

As for writing brushes, their fate seems even worse. Compared with "ballpoint pens," their inconvenience is even more obvious. To use a writing brush, you need an inkstone and ink, or at least an ink box or ink boat (Shanghai has this thing, shaped like a small boat, I don't know what it's called, using ink paste, packed in toothpaste-like tubes, squeezed out when used), which is not as convenient as a ballpoint pen, and you can't hang the brush on your lapel or clip it in your pocket. More importantly, writing with a writing brush is much slower than writing with a ballpoint pen, which is the fatal flaw of the writing brush. In terms of price, the writing brush, along with the attached accessories, and considering the short period of use, is not necessarily much cheaper than a ballpoint pen. Good imported ballpoint pens are naturally very expensive, but good writing brushes are not cheap either. Recently, someone in Peiping saw pens priced at more than 10 million yuan at Dai Yuexuan. Naturally, ballpoint pens require foreign exchange, and even those made in China require materials to be bought from abroad, while writing brushes are domestically produced; but we must strive to make ballpoint pens also domestically produced. As for the fact that the Ministry of Education used to stipulate that students should use writing brushes, it seemed to only focus on "preserving national essence" or "native culture"; students did not pay attention to this at all, and more and more people used ballpoint pens. Modern life needs ballpoint pens, which is inevitable and reasonable, and the empty name of "native culture" cannot resist this. Writing brushes should be preserved, and it is enough to let a small number of calligraphers and painters preserve them. Forcing everyone to use them will not work. As for the fact that students' writing is not good now, it is because they have not been seriously trained, which has nothing to do with not using writing brushes. A student's writing is good if it is clear and neat, whether they use a ballpoint pen or a writing brush.

Students do not like to pay attention to handwriting, nor do they like classical Chinese and ancient books—although there are those who buy typeset editions of ancient books, but not many. They have a lot of homework and are busy, so they cannot appreciate the art of calligraphy, and they even neglect the function of writing, only seeking speed and writing unclearly, making it difficult to recognize. Because classical Chinese and ancient books are difficult and hard to understand, they also feel that it is not worth the effort to read them. Fundamentally, it is because they do not value history and old culture. This is also an inevitable process, and we do not need to be surprised. However, we must make young people write clearly and neatly to fulfill the basic function of writing, and on the one hand, we must strive to compile some ancient books with clear and detailed annotations in both vernacular and classical Chinese for young people to read. We should critically accept history and old culture as part of the material for creating a new culture, and it is wrong to obliterate it all at once. In fact, young people do not really obliterate classical Chinese and ancient books all at once. Just looking at the fact that there are already eight vernacular translations of Guwen Guanzhi, and there are already three of Tang Poems Three Hundred (although only one is relatively good), we can know that the need for this kind of book is still great—and the buyers are probably mostly young people. So we should know the direction of our efforts. As for the art of calligraphy and specialized research on classical Chinese and ancient books, it is better to leave it to a small number of people who are interested, and universities or independent colleges should cultivate these people.

Connected to this, I thought of the reform of Chinese painting and Peking opera, and there are people working hard on both of these tasks now. The other day, a young colleague talked to me about these two issues, and he felt that Chinese painting and Peking opera have already been fully developed and have become stereotyped, so there is no need to reform them, and there is no way to reform them; forcibly reforming them will probably only produce some things that are neither old nor new, and the results may not be good. He felt that folk art was originally immature and had not been developed, so we might be able to promote its development. Like Chinese painting and Peking opera, which have already reached their peak, it is time for them to decline and pass, and trying to pull them is probably ultimately a thankless task. In the author's opinion, the creation of our new culture and new art must critically adopt old culture and old art, both the art of the scholar-officials and the folk art can be used, and foreign art can also be used, but they must be based on this era and this country. Reform is probably inevitably dragged by the old era, and it will not go far, and perhaps it will not be able to move at all. It is better to start a new stove, but the old materials can be selectively used. What should pass will always pass.

### Hubei to Use Education Funds to Aid Needy and Outstanding Students; Gansu Plans to Raise 2.5 Billion to Award Needy Students

[Dispatch from our newspaper, Baoding, 30th] Hubei Province will thoroughly aid all needy and outstanding students in public and private schools throughout the province by using two methods of distributing church funds and interest: (1) The existing education fund of 3 billion will be extracted in three installments to purchase and store goods; (2) The interest on the fund will be distributed to needy and outstanding students reported by each school in proportion, but the amount received by each person cannot exceed two-thirds of the public expense students' allowance; (3) Public expense students will not be aided.

[Dispatch from our newspaper, Lanzhou, 30th] The Gansu Education Department's Poverty-Stricken Student Scholarship Committee recently raised 2.5 billion in scholarships. In addition to the provincial government bearing 900 million, the Provincial Bank and Provincial Trading Company each bear 800 million. The distribution issues were discussed today. Furthermore, the Gansu Provincial Government welcomes more than 200 Gansu graduates from various universities this year to return to the province to work, and all travel expenses will be borne by the provincial government.

### University Education is Not Compulsory Education; Full Public Expense is Impossible; Ministry of Education Requests Opinions from Jiaotong and Zhengzhi Universities on Major Issues

[Dispatch from our newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Education stated: National Jiaotong University and National Zhengzhi University recently telegraphed the Ministry of Education, requesting that all self-funded and semi-public expense students be given full public expense or special subsidies. This is impossible in both theory and fact. Higher education is not comparable to compulsory education; no country has an example of the government providing all meals for university students. In our country, students in schools above the junior college level who enjoy public expense treatment have reached one-half of the total number. Before March, the government's financial burden accounted for 25% of the education funds managed by this Ministry. After the monthly adjustment of the salaries of public school teachers and staff in April, the supplementary food expenses for public expense students must also be increased monthly, and the required amount of funds is still difficult to estimate at this time. This kind of expenditure directly increases the burden on the national treasury and indirectly reduces the enrichment of school teaching equipment. It is not only inconsistent with educational principles, but it is also not a policy that the government is willing to adopt. In response to the requests from Jiaotong University and Zhengzhi University, this Ministry will issue a cordial telegram to inform the staff and students. If this leads to trouble, it will be severely punished without leniency.

### Government Approves Over 10 Billion in Subsidies for Private Universities and Colleges

### How to Earn Respect?

— Zhou He

Written for the 7th Normal Education Movement Week

Today's teachers want equal status with civil servants to protect their treatment, and they want to increase tuition fees or teacher appreciation funds to maintain their livelihoods. If they charge parents a few extra dollars, the school is called a "school shop" and said to be illegal, because merchants can raise prices at will, while teachers must "serve the public and abide by the law." Therefore, in recent years, even if normal schools waive tuition fees and subsidize meals, there are still not many applicants. Even those who are willing to apply are mostly female. The teaching profession is not respected to this extent. What is the reason for this? In my opinion, there are probably three:

Lack of Respect for Teachers First, because now, as long as teachers have some knowledge, they can become teachers. Taking the situation in Shanghai as an example, more than half of the national teachers have not received teacher training. Usually, ordinary middle school graduates can qualify after serving for one year. Thus, people who become officials after leaving their jobs, or who fail in business, become teachers. Since it is so easy to become a teacher, you can do it, and I can do it, so people no longer value teachers.

Second, I want to talk about the current normal education. Generally speaking, graduates of normal schools should teach very well. But in fact, this is not the case. Ordinary teachers teach this way, and normal school graduates also teach this way. Even in middle schools, most teachers who graduate from education departments lack specialized skills. Apart from administration, they cannot be teachers. As a result, the status of teachers has declined even further, and it is conceivable that they are not respected.

Third, in recent years, the path of studying has long been ignored. Children spend so much money from elementary school to university for sixteen years before they can graduate. Even if they graduate, they do not necessarily have a way out. It is better to change plans early and teach children to learn business, open shops, and do business, so that the economic situation can be improved. Therefore, in the eyes of parents, school teachers are unimportant. If you really want your children to study, you can hire a teacher to come to your home. Fortunately, the cost is very low, only slightly more than a servant.

Not Teaching Books, But Teaching People From this, it can be seen that the lack of respect for teachers is indeed justified. If we want to persuade people to respect teachers, we must make everyone willingly respect teachers. The best way is to make them feel that teachers are as indispensable as rice, and that the education of their children must rely on teachers to have hope. Therefore, if we become teachers, we must not follow the traditional concept. The work of ordinary teachers is only to teach books, regardless of whether students are male or female, healthy or weak, intelligent or not, they do not care about anything. So everyone can teach. Now we want to abolish textbooks, abolish the same old textbooks, and teach with people as the object. Then everyone can rely on their own talents and develop their own abilities. In this way, teachers are indispensable, and normal school graduates are indispensable. Secondly, the method of teaching people now must also be changed. In the past, teaching books was considered good as long as you had knowledge, rich materials, and detailed explanations. Now, teaching people means teaching people to learn by themselves, so learning should be turned into an activity. In learning activities, teachers are in a guiding position, like the chairman of a meeting or the leader of a trip. Therefore, an excellent teacher must have a new concept of children and know how children learn in order to be competent. The result of this kind of teaching will definitely be very good, and parents will be happy to send their children to school. The status of teachers will naturally increase. Finally, we know that the center of ancient education was entirely in the family. Parents in the family were like nannies, lawyers, judges, and teachers. Since the industrial revolution, the organization of the family has changed, and women have also gone to society to find jobs. Therefore, children must be sent to school, and the school has replaced the family and become the center of education. The responsibility of teachers, in addition to knowledge, is also to guide various issues such as occupation and marriage. This is a matter of course, but we are disappointed with modern schools. Teachers in modern schools do not ask about anything except academics. The academics obtained in this way have become the decoration of life, which may or may not be there. If not, which parent would not be willing to entrust their children to teachers? Because the teacher I am talking about lives with children all day long, and is an expert in guiding children on various issues.

Just imagine, the work of modern teachers is no longer teaching books but teaching people. Those who are taught truly gain learning, and this learning completely solves various problems in life. These problems cannot be taken care of by any parent. Only schools, only teachers in schools, can take on this task. Then, how can parents not respect teachers, and how can teachers not increase their status in society?

Now, if we want to promote normal education, we should guide normal students well, starting from this.

### Zhou Dayun's Consecutive Accurate Shots: Qingbai Reverses Defeat Against Allentate

US Navy Suffers Defeat 37-43; Qingbai Trails by 12 Points in First Half

[Our Newspaper] The US Navy Allentate basketball team took to the court again at 7 pm last night against Qingbai at the Municipal Gymnasium.

Qingbai trailed by 12 points, 10-22, in the first half. The game drew over a thousand spectators who were all delighted. Zhou Dayun's shooting for Qingbai, with repeated accurate shots, attracted the most attention from the audience. He should be given the most credit for this victory. Allentate's Stone Fuller and Edson were still very active. Qingbai only began to surpass in the third quarter, and continued the momentum in the final quarter, leaving the visiting team helpless.

Allentate Dominates Initially The game started at 7 pm. Allentate's Stone Fuller broke the ice. Qingbai's Zhou Dayun quickly scored two goals, taking the lead. From then on, it was the visiting team's world. Allentate's lineup, besides Stone, consisted of Edson, Haggreen, Allen, and Stann, the same original lineup. Qingbai's lineup was Zhou, Xu Heng, Ma Canxi, Cai Yanxiong, and Chen Xianglong. The first quarter ended with a score of 8-5. When the second quarter continued, Qingbai called two timeouts, which could be described as a sign of poor performance. Chen Qingjiang once replaced Xianglong with, and Zhang Shaoqing replaced Dayun, but the situation was still difficult to resist. The first half ended with a score of 22-10, with Allentate dominating for a time.

Qingbai Team's Turnaround In the third quarter, Dayun resumed his prowess, opening fire left and right upon contact. Xu Heng and Yanxiong both seemed like awakened lions, and Dayun's shooting was so smooth that they actually surpassed with a score of 29-28. Allentate replaced Haggreen with Kuras. The quarter ended shortly after the substitution was completed. In the final quarter, Qingbai's momentum and luck were both thriving. The opponent replaced Stone Fuller with Crawford. Through everyone's efforts, Qingbai took the lead all the way. Zhou and Cai's shots sometimes had unexpected gains. The visiting team's Stone re-entered the battle, but it was of no avail. The final score was 43-37. Qingbai came from behind, with a skillful victory.

### Preferential Treatment for National Games Athletes: Half Price for Trains, 20% Discount for Ships

### A Prodigy of Long-Distance Running in North China: Introduction to Liu Jingkun: Qingdao's Champion is Working Hard, Hoping to Show His Talents at the National Games

[Our Newspaper Qingdao Airmail] Japan has ten long-distance running prodigies. If we talk about the top ten long-distance runners in China today, Liu Jingkun of North China should be one of them. But according to the reporter's humble opinion, Liu Jingkun is already among the top three in today's long-distance running talents. There is no problem in scoring points at this year's National Games. If given the opportunity, he and Lou Wenao will become the two gems of Chinese long-distance running.

Mr. Liu showed his talent among long-distance runners early on, but due to difficult living conditions, he worries about firewood, rice, oil, and salt every day and never takes athletes as a career. He is currently serving in the 9th Regiment of the 208th Division of the Youth Army. He does not have super nutrition, and at the same time, due to his duties and environmental conditions, he lacks scientific training, but the hope for the future is great. Therefore, the reporter has written a short article to introduce him.

Mr. Liu is from Weixian, Shandong Province, and let Qingdao. He is 27 years old this year, 1.70 meters tall, and weighs 56 kilograms. During middle school, his 800-meter time was 2 minutes and 6.7 seconds, and his 1,500-meter time was 4 minutes and 20 seconds. In the Sino-American Games in Qingdao last autumn, his time was 4 minutes and 21 seconds, which was several hundred meters away from the second place, so the result was not satisfactory. Last year, in the Beijing Games, his 10,000-meter run was 24 minutes and 10 seconds, several laps away from the second place, which was also unsatisfactory. A few years ago, Mr. Liu's 5,000-meter time was 16 minutes and 25 seconds. In one game, not accustomed to the high temperature above 100 degrees, the veteran Gong Zhenglin won first place, with a time of more than 17 minutes, which also felt regretful.

In the autumn of the 35th year, Mr. Liu ran the 10,000 meters in Qingdao with a time of 33 minutes and 15 seconds, breaking the national record. At this time, Mr. Lou Wenao ran more than 33 minutes and 40 seconds in Shanghai. Since then, new results have been seen, and today he has created a highest record of 31 minutes and 27 seconds. The progress is truly amazing. And Mr. Liu has no rules for practice. Qingdao has no suitable sports field for practice, so there are no accurate records. The opening of the National Games is approaching. At this time, Mr. Liu has become the target of various parties, which is quite difficult. This shows that it is not easy to be a pure amateur athlete. The other day, the Qingdao City held an 8,000-meter cross-country race. Mr. Liu led all the way and took first place with ease. His posture is excellent, and he is a natural talent. Today, Mr. Liu visited the reporter at his residence and said that he decided to participate in the National Games. He will follow the reporter's advice to take care of his affairs and then start practicing. The official practice must be in the afternoon to adapt to the hot and humid climate of Shanghai in mid-May. He hopes to get a hard-earned one-month progress schedule, and hopes that the advanced people in the domestic sports world will help him. (Shen Zhi)

### Strengthening Control of the Financial Market: Short-Term Treasury Bills to be Issued Soon; Monthly Interest Set at Five Percent; National Bank Fully Prepared

The Central Bank is actively preparing for the issuance of short-term treasury bills. Once the Ministry of Finance announces the regulations, the bills are expected to be officially issued within about two weeks. It is understood that there is no fixed total amount for these treasury bills. Instead, the Central Bank will issue them as needed, with terms of approximately one, two, or three months. The monthly interest rate is set at five percent, and the bills will be issued at a 10% discount. Banks, money shops, and the public will be able to purchase them, and they can be used as collateral and security.

The significant meaning of issuing treasury bills lies in adjusting needs and absorbing floating capital. In the past, the absorption of floating capital was mostly done through the sale of materials. Now, the Central Bank can also use treasury bills to tighten credit at any time and place. Therefore, in terms of strengthening control of the financial market, it is like adding a new force.

In other news, the government's issuance of short-term national treasury bills was formally approved by the Executive Yuan last week. These national treasury bills will be in denominations of 10 million, 50 million, 100 million, 500 million, and 1 billion. The terms will be one, two, or three months. The interest rate will be a monthly rate of five percent, and the Central Bank will be entrusted to issue them at a discount in the open market at any time according to actual needs. The amount of issuance will also depend on the needs. The Central Bank has made full preparations and will issue them immediately upon receiving the order. National banks, commercial banks, and people of all social classes can purchase them, and they can circulate freely in the market as a means of payment. The purpose of this issuance of treasury bills is entirely to control the market, tighten credit, and achieve the goal of absorbing floating capital. In the past, the government's issuance of US dollar treasury bills and the sale of gold could absorb floating capital, but the price paid was extremely high. We cannot repeat the same mistakes. We are specifically adopting a high-interest policy and issuing short-term national treasury bills for sale in the open market, increasing the Central Bank's tools for controlling the market. Because they can be issued at any time, and issuance can be reduced when credit is tight and increased when credit is loose, it is planned to recover 200 billion or 300 billion legal tender by issuing 200 billion or 300 billion treasury bills. This puts us in a proactive position to control the market, unlike government bonds, which are passive. The original interest rate was a monthly rate of five percent, which is far from the market interest rate, so it is issued at a discount. The amount of the discount increases the interest. Under the current circumstances, the price paid is not high, which is more cost-effective. Certain economic authorities believe that the Central Bank has this tool, which can indeed recover floating capital and achieve the goal of controlling the market and tightening credit.

[This Newspaper's Report] According to information from the Central Bank, the principal and interest of maturing US dollar treasury bills will be paid in national currency at the Central Bank's foreign exchange rate on that day. The rumor that they will be paid with the soon-to-be-issued short-term treasury bills is not true.

### Chinese Stocks Experience a Decline; Small Stocks are Weak and Unable to Recover

### Foreign Stocks See Little Supply and High Demand; Consolidated Bonds Initially Weak, Then Strong

Foreign stocks saw an expanded selling trend yesterday, with sparse trading, little supply, and high demand. Hong Kong Electric fell, then recovered midway. Jardine Matheson opened at 1.75 million, finally falling to close within 1.7 million, Jardine Matheson, British American Tobacco, and Guangda each fell by 10% compared to the close before the holiday.

Compared to before the holiday, Type A and B fell by 2,000 yuan, Consolidated Type D fell by 1,000 yuan, Type C rose by 2,000 yuan, as did Consolidated Type E. The turnover was about 3 million.

### Credit Conditions Initially Loose, Then Tight

Yesterday, the local market saw credit conditions initially loose, then tight. In the clearing of notes and bills among banks and money shops, national banks and bureaus showed a total net inflow of 395.5 billion, of which the Central Bank showed a net outflow of 391.6 billion, the Bank of China showed a net inflow of 371.5 billion, the Bank of Communications showed a net inflow of 222.2 billion, the Farmers Bank showed a net inflow of 130.8 billion, the Central Trust Bureau showed a net inflow of 62.2 billion, the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau showed a net outflow of 7.6 billion, the Central Cooperative Treasury showed a net inflow of 8 billion, and various foreign banks in the city showed a total net inflow of 106.4 billion.

### Sugar Recovers

Sugar has been falling since last Friday, reaching its lowest price. By Saturday, Taiwan sugar had rebounded by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. During the holiday, informal trading saw small fluctuations. Yesterday, the municipal guild marked up the price again, showing further increases. Spot 24 coarse white was 4.7 million yuan, up 150,000 yuan from last Saturday. Semi-white was 5 million yuan, up 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. 20 medium sugar white was 4.4 million to 4.7 million yuan, up 270,000 yuan.

Local sugar also followed suit, rising. Swatow refined blue opened at 2.925 million yuan, then rose to 3.05 million yuan, up 250,000 yuan, with an estimated 500-600 bags. Xinghua white ordinary was 4.3 million to 4.5 million yuan, Xing red was 2.98 million to 3 million yuan, with an estimated 500+ baskets. Diao Qing rose 250,000 yuan, opening at 2.7 million yuan for 300+ bags. Hainan, with very little inventory being moved, was still difficult to recover, trading at 2 million to 1.95 million yuan for about 200 pieces, which can be said to be the lowest price.

### Joint Sugar Transport to Shanghai

[This Newspaper's Report] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiaoren ship returned to Shanghai from Kaohsiung the day before yesterday, carrying over 22,000 bags of sugar. Also, the Linsen ship arrived at the port from Kaohsiung yesterday, also carrying over 26,600 bags of sugar.

### Tea Market Firm and Stable

Since the varieties of black, green, and scented tea have been dwindling, sellers are not inclined to loosen their grip, and the supply in the market has become even scarcer. However, asking prices are soaring, and although buyers are aware that both domestic and foreign sales are good, they feel that they cannot get what they want at the moment and are taking a wait-and-see approach. Throughout the day, supply and demand gradually decreased, and the trading lacked distinguishing features, with little price movement. Prices were mostly similar to last week.

### Soap Weak

The soap market for daily necessities is weak because credit is still tight, hidden interest rates are unusually high, and buyers lack the ability to take deliveries. In addition, prices are inverted compared to other cities, causing customer concern. There are even returned goods being sold off, resulting in abundant inventory in the market. Although factory prices have increased, local dealers rarely accept them. Sentiment is depressed, and asking prices weaken after an initial increase.

By the close, Guben Soap had fallen by 110,000 yuan compared to before the holiday (27th), closing at a low price of 5.74 million. Huang Xiangmao, Guanghua, and others also fell by about 100,000 yuan each.

Trading among match dealers was not smooth, and only the Meili Phoenix and Erlao brands rose by 500,000 to 200,000 yuan, respectively. The prices of Xiong brand matches varied. The kerosene and candle markets were both stable, but trading was sparse.

### Cigarettes Over Supplied

Yesterday's cigarette market opened weak. Trading inside the exchanges was sparse, and dealers bought little additional stock. The month-end tightness of credit further depressed the market. Sellers were more inclined to sell quickly and in large quantities. There were also fellow dealers from Hankou and other places selling off stock, and a significant amount of stock was also transferred between dealers. Rumors that the US exchange rate would be lowered further eroded confidence. The market trend was downwards. Lastly, the ten-pack of British American Tobacco cigarettes was priced low to 99.5 million yuan at close, a sharp drop of 3.5 million yuan compared to before the holiday (27th). Old Knife Tobacco also dropped by 2.5 million, closing at 79 million yuan. Among the Chinese brands, banks, brandy, double axes and white horses sold relatively well, holding up the market. Other brands mostly dropped from 1,000 to 15,000 yuan, while American cigarettes and canned tobacco fluctuated.

### Tung Oil Procurement Price Adjustment

The Committee for Reviewing and Determining the Prices of Important Export Goods, jointly organized by the Export Control Administration, the China Trust Bureau, the Four Banks Joint Office, and four other units, was established on the 13th of this month. Its first decision was to set the tung oil procurement price at 6.5 million yuan per standard picul. So far, more than 700 piculs have been purchased. However, since the foreign exchange rate was adjusted from 195,000 yuan to 255,000 yuan, the price of tung oil has risen to 7.9 million yuan. To adapt to the changing environment, the committee held a special meeting on the 30th, resolving that the procurement prices for Shanghai and Wuhu be adjusted to 7.5 million yuan, and for Guangzhou to 8 million yuan, effective today.

### Declining Prices Reported from Production Areas Depress Market Sentiment; Rice and Flour Prices Decline; Oil Cakes and Miscellaneous Grains Share Weakness

The rice market declined because declining prices were reported from Wuxi the day before, depressing market sentiment. In the morning, sellers still called for the original prices, but there were few inquiries. Finally, due to weak local demand and limited sales, the market could not hold its ground, and sellers had to lower prices to attract customers. Both the North and South markets fell by 100,000 yuan compared to the close last week. White geng rice was 3.5 million in the South market and 3.6 million in the North market. Nangang rice shipments were high, and the price declined more significantly, with early and thin rice each falling by 150,000. The people's food allocation committee sold early rice in the North market at a price of 3.3 million yuan, but there were few buyers. The South market did not sell any.

Amidst the decline in rice prices, flour also saw a sharp drop, especially since prices in Suzhou and Wuxi were weak, causing sellers to be nervous and sell off stock. There were few inquiries from North suppliers, and local retail sales were also stagnant. The market opened with a decline, with the central market being the weakest. Prices recovered slightly at the close, but all brands were down by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Bingchuan flour opened at 1.425 million, falling to a low of 1.415 million, but recovered to the opening price at the close. Hongfeng and Jiancheng were both down by 60,000+ yuan, with the former entering the 1.4 million range. Large-bag bran fell sharply by 40,000 to 50,000.

The prices of miscellaneous grains varied, but most were weak. Soybeans opened very stagnant, and the price barely held its ground. Later, Swatow suppliers bought slightly, pushing up higher-quality goods by 20,000 to 30,000. Dou beans fell by 40,000 to 50,000. Although Qingdao suppliers bought some corn, they did not buy much, so the price fell by 60,000 to 70,000. Selected Qing was difficult to sell, and the price dropped by 40,000 to 50,000. Mung beans and red sorghum saw little trading and the market was weak. Red beans were stable. Raw peanuts, influenced by Guangzhou suppliers, initially rose by 400,000 to 500,000, but later weakened due to oversupply, finally rising by 300,000 to 400,000.

Due to the decline in rice prices and other miscellaneous grains, the edible oil market was weak. Moreover, prices in Wuxi and other places were low, causing widespread uncertainty. Local shops rarely added stock, and sellers, finding it difficult to sell, voluntarily lowered prices. Oil mills also offered lower prices. Datong soybean oil opened at 7.45 million, falling slightly to 7.35 million at the close. Tongfeng soybean oil even fell slightly to 7.3 million at the close. Both were down 150,000 to 200,000. There was a large supply of raw oil, and prices fell sharply. Qingdao Jitong raw oil closed at 8.75 million, a drop of 400,000 yuan. Raw sesame oil also fell sharply by 400,000, and raw rapeseed oil and clarified oil were down by 200,000 each. Bean cake was not bought by suppliers, and the price dropped by 20,000 to 30,000.

### China Trust Bureau to Purchase Frozen Eggs

To be Exported in Mid-April

In view of the sunny weather in recent days, the rush of fresh eggs, and the decline in prices, the China Trust Bureau will negotiate with the frozen egg industry on the 30th, agreeing to a transaction price of 6.6 million yuan per picul, continuing to purchase the second batch of frozen eggs for the year, totaling 504 tons, with each ton valued at 2.204 billion yuan including packaging.

It was also learned that another third batch of frozen eggs, totaling 500 tons, is planned to be purchased within 12 days. It is expected that around 2,000 tons will be collected, ready to be loaded onto British ships after mid-April. As for how much of the first batch of frozen eggs, 705 tons, ordered by the bureau on March 19th, will be delivered, a decision will be made today.

### Newsprint Declines

The authorities' handling of materials imported with self-provided foreign exchange is coming to an end. Among these materials are approximately 6,000 to 7,000 tons of various types of paper, of which Canadian and Swedish newsprint account for nine-tenths. In recent days, paper merchants have been rushing to the authorities to complete purchase procedures. Once completed, they will be able to supply the market, so yesterday the market price of American newsprint dropped sharply by 200,000 yuan per ream compared to before the holiday (27th), closing at a low of 4.65 million yuan. Double-sized paper also fell sharply by 150,000 yuan per ream. Other Western white, glossy, typing, and kraft papers also experienced significant declines ranging from 100,000 to 500,000 or 600,000.

### Rayon Declines; Factory-Made Yarn Soft; Silk Goods Fall

Rayon prices declined yesterday. 120-count Asahi brand glossy rayon opened at 194 million yuan. Supply and demand were relatively balanced, and the price briefly rose to 200 million yuan. The noon close was 197 million yuan for immediate payment. In the afternoon, the price fell to a selling price of 90 million yuan, and the final price was 91 million yuan.

Factory-made yarn was slightly soft yesterday. D-grade yarn was priced at 308 million yuan, C-grade five-dan split yarn traded at 310 million yuan, and high-quality small lots traded at 305 million. Thousand-count yarn saw very little trading, and asking prices were also slightly softer.

Silk goods fell yesterday. Huaqiang Zhensi quilt covers opened at 120 million yuan. It was then heard that the stock market had declined, causing market sentiment to soften, and asking prices fell frequently. By the close, the price had dropped to 114.5 million yuan for immediate payment. Trading of Dachenge checkered crepe was extremely limited. The closing price was 440,000 yuan. For other goods, factory prices mostly did not change, but market prices were slightly softer.

### Frequent Negative News; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Decline; Purchase Orders for Textile Construction Sold Cloth Decrease

Yesterday's cotton yarn market was weak. Prices had risen too much before the holiday, it was the end of the month, credit had not loosened, and customer demand turned sluggish. The local market was dull. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn fell by 7 million immediately after opening above the 200 million yuan mark. Subsequently, rumors that the foreign exchange rate might be lowered further eroded confidence, and with the general decline in non-industry goods, bulls competed to sell off and shorts seized the opportunity to become active. The market quickly saw an oversupply, and prices plummeted to 187 million yuan.

By the close, some shorts covered their positions, pushing the price back up to the 190 million yuan mark. It closed at 190 million yuan, a drop of 17 million yuan compared to before the holiday (27th). 21-count Double Horse yarn saw a lot of selling, falling to a low of 114 million yuan at the close, a massive drop of 20 million. Other coarse and fine yarns, such as 20-count, 16-count, and 32-count, also fell by about 10%.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened with frequent negative news, causing widespread unease. Rumors that the foreign exchange benchmark price might be lowered caused those with floating profits to rush to sell off, and dealers released stock. Local suppliers only made a few purchases in line with the approved purchase orders. Only Shanxi suppliers slightly absorbed stock. The market was weak and spiritless.

12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 4.32 million yuan, gradually falling to a low price of 4.23 million yuan. Dye factories slightly took advantage of the low prices, and the price recovered slightly to 4.3 million yuan at the close, a drop of 100,000 yuan compared to before the holiday (27th). Other fine cloths also fell by 100,000 to 150,000 yuan, but the market remained weak after the close, with Dragon Head fine cloth trading at 4.25 million yuan. Approved purchase orders actually had to be discounted by 50,000 yuan, with sales made at 4.2 million yuan.

In addition, Double Flying Dragon fine cloth initially traded at 3.75 million yuan, and finally closed at 3.85 million yuan. Four Gentlemen poplin and straight-grain fine twill color fabrics, shilin cloth, etc., fluctuated.

Textile Construction Sold Cloth

[This Newspaper's Report] Textile Construction Company opened its cloth sale as usual yesterday, selling a total of 3,040 bolts of cotton cloth and 100 bedsheets. Purchase orders decreased compared to before, with only 34 orders, of which all but 7 orders from factories purchasing 1,520 bolts were purchased by cloth shops.

In other news, Textile Construction Company supplied 17 types of cotton cloth, including 2 types of bedsheets and 20-count and 21-count B-grade Dragon Head fine cloth, priced at 3.75 million yuan. Yuan poplin and straight-grain fine twill have not yet been opened for sale, and there are few purchase orders.

### Textile Industry Hopes Authorities Consider Increasing Tax on Cotton Yarn

[This Newspaper's Report] According to people in the local textile industry speaking to our reporter: It is reported that the financial authorities are scheduled to increase the consolidated tax rate on cotton yarn from 7% to 10% starting on April 1st. On the surface, this is only an increase of 3%, but in reality, calculated as a percentage, it increases by more than 42% compared to the original tax rate.

The cotton consolidated tax was originally calculated based on the price of yarn. As the price of yarn rises, the consolidated tax paid also increases accordingly. If the tax rate is further increased, it is like both increasing the base salary and calculating it based on the cost of living index, which is something the textile industry, now in a precarious state, cannot afford.

Textiles are the only sector of the national industry that has a solid foundation. After the victory, the textile industry seemed to be booming due to the surge in demand for clothing. Some people believe that it should not be difficult for the textile industry to bear a heavier burden, and even some government officials may think this way.

However, the industry has long been exhausted of financial and material resources after eight years of war. After the victory, the prices of raw materials soared, and the proportion was even higher than that of finished textile products. Therefore, the textile industry can never restore to its pre-war state.

In addition, the industry has made significant sacrifices to support the government's price stabilization and control policies. Most factories are now facing a crisis. The government should start by reducing taxes to support light industry, so that the industry can prosper, which will indirectly increase the country's tax revenue. Taking a "killing the goose to get the eggs" approach and increasing the tax rate regardless of the consequences will directly increase production costs, weaken purchasing power, threaten the survival of the textile industry, indirectly increase the burden on the people, and stimulate price increases. This is not a proper policy. It is hoped that the wise authorities will consider this.

### Ample Supply of Raw Cotton

[This Newspaper's Report] It is widely rumored that there will be a shortage of raw cotton supplies, and some manufacturers are even worried about having to shut down their factories. According to reliable sources, the government has already made preparations for the supply of raw cotton. Yesterday, officials from the Central Bank announced that more than 80,000 bales of American and Indian cotton will arrive in Shanghai in the coming weeks. In addition, a total of 210,000 bales of American and Indian cotton have been ordered to be shipped in April and May, and the ordering of large quantities of American and Indian cotton to be shipped in June and July is ongoing. Therefore, there is definitely no problem with the raw materials for the textile industry.

Hubei Cotton Merchants Return to Hankou

[This Newspaper's Report] The Hubei cotton merchant delegation previously contacted the Yarn Control Committee to negotiate the purchase of cotton, aiming to quickly secure a large amount of raw cotton.

It is now learned that the Hubei cotton merchants, in support of this policy, acknowledge that if they are entrusted with the purchase, they are willing to provide full collateral for the working capital they receive, but they request to receive the funds and deliver the cotton in Hankou.

The Yarn Control Committee stated that all terms, except for receiving cotton outside the designated areas, will be handled in accordance with the contract signed with Shanghai cotton merchants.

The delegates Cheng Ziju, Lin Houzhou, Yuan Boxian, Wang Heqing, and others have returned to Hankou together to convene a general meeting of members to report on the results of the negotiations, and will then come to Shanghai to sign the contract, in order to quickly purchase a large amount of cotton for the government.

### Allocation of Loan Amounts in Various Regions Determined at Loan Assessment Meeting

The Salt Loan Review Committee of the Four Banks Joint Office held a meeting in the conference room on the second floor of the Bank of China at 10:00 AM yesterday (30th), chaired by Cai Gongzhuang, and passed 20 motions. The most important of these was the allocation of loan amounts for salt in various regions for this year. The total loan amount for salt this year is 1 trillion yuan, with 700 billion allocated for marketing and 300.1 billion for production.

### Actively Preventing Bank Draft Bounces: Financial Management Bureau is Investigating the Cause, Strictly Enforcing No Cashing of Same-Day Checks

[Report from our Newspaper] Mr. Li Lixia, Director of the Municipal Financial Management Bureau, told reporters yesterday: The bureau is still regularly inspecting the operations of banks and financial institutions. Generally, the operations of banks and financial institutions are considered normal. As for the number of bounced checks, it currently accounts for about two percent of the total amount exchanged, which cannot be considered a large amount. However, the bureau is actively investigating the cause of bounced checks to determine whether the fault lies with the customers or the banks themselves, and then take appropriate action.

Another report: The Financial Management Bureau is researching ways to prevent bounced checks, thoroughly investigating the causes. If the responsibility lies with the bank, it will be punished accordingly. If the responsibility lies with the customer, the bureau will investigate their intentions and impose effective sanctions. It was also stated that the bureau strictly enforces the rule that same-day checks cannot be cashed.

Another report: The Financial Management Bureau recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance, requiring special study of bounced checks in the city's banks and financial institutions. It stipulates that any depositor found to have bounced three checks will be warned and have their account closed. Similar penalties will be imposed if bounced checks occur at three different locations or three different banks simultaneously, with no leniency. Yesterday, the Financial Management Bureau specially assigned the Economic Crime Division to jointly investigate the matter.

### Brief Notes on Storytelling

— Dai Bufan

(1)

The "Opening Remarks" (入話) in storytelling (also known as "Victorious First Chapter," 得勝頭迴, equivalent to the "Preface" 開篇 in ballad singing 彈詞) often have sources. For example, the "Opening Remarks" in the 33rd chapter of "Slapping the Table in Amazement" (拍案驚奇), "Zhang Yuanwai Righteously Fosters an Orphan, Bao Longtu's Wisdom in Joint Documents" (張員外義撫螟蛉子，包龍圖智) is from a piece by Zhang Yong (張詠) in "Records of Distinguished Ministers of the Song Dynasty, Former Collection" (宋名臣言行錄前集) (compiled by Zhu Xi 朱熹), Volume 3: "When Lord Zhang Yong was in Hangzhou, a wealthy man on his deathbed, whose son was only three years old, instructed his son-in-law to manage his wealth, leaving a letter to his son-in-law, saying: 'If you wish to divide the property in the future, give three-tenths to the son and seven-tenths to the son-in-law.' When the son grew up, a lawsuit arose over the property. The son-in-law presented the letter to the court, requesting that the original agreement be followed. Lord Zhang Yong read it, poured wine on the ground, and said: 'Your father-in-law was a wise man. He entrusted the son to you because he was young. Otherwise, the son would have died at your hands.' He ordered that three-tenths of the property be given to the son-in-law and seven-tenths to the son, and they both wept and thanked him before departing. (Tombstone 碑) '—Note: The above is excerpted from the original Ming Chongzhen Zhang Song engraved edition. A small "Tombstone" character is attached to the end of the text. This matter is presumably recorded by Zhu Xi from Zhang Yong's tombstone."

The above plot is the same as what is said in "Slapping the Table in Amazement." However, the latter changed the will to:

"Zhang Yi Fei, is not my son, the family property should all be given to my son-in-law, outsiders are not allowed to compete for it." (一張一非我子也家財盡與我婿外人不得爭佔一)

Due to the different ways of reading (punctuation), the magistrate judged it accordingly.

Regarding the source of storytelling and novel themes, Mr. Zhao Zuìshēn has worked diligently and has almost found the "natal home" (娘家) for all the stories in "Three Words" (三言) and "Two Slaps" (二拍). I think, if someone finds the "natal home" of these storytelling "Opening Remarks," wouldn't it be more interesting?

The source of "Opening Remarks," in addition to applying stories from previous books as mentioned in the previous section and arbitrary fabrication by storytellers or writers, seems to also involve excerpting the storytelling of predecessors. For example, the "Opening Remarks" in the 27th chapter of "Slapping the Table in Amazement" narrates the story of Wang Congshi losing his wife when moving house and later reuniting in Quzhou, which is roughly the same as the 10th chapter of "Nodding Head Stone" (石點頭), "Wang Ruren's Separation and Reunion of the Fish Dream" (王孺人離合團魚夢). It seems that "Nodding Head Stone" and "First Slap of Slapping the Table in Amazement" were both products of the Chongzhen era. I don't know if "Slapping the Table in Amazement" deleted "Nodding Head Stone" or if "Nodding Head Stone" elaborated on "Slapping the Table in Amazement"? However, the most likely hypothesis is that this Song Dynasty story was originally a Song Dynasty storytelling; contemporary authors would probably not take other people's works to delete or elaborate on, but must have seen the things of the predecessors and adapted them.

Regarding the 36th chapter of the "First Slap of Slapping the Table in Amazement," "The Lazy Monk in the East Corridor Summons Demons, The Black-Clad Thief Commits Adultery, Murder, and Killing" (東廊僧怠招魔，黑衣盜奸生殺), Mr. Zhao Jingshen said it was from "Taiping Guangji" (太平廣記), "Collection of Strange Tales" (集異記), etc. (see "Casual Talks on Novels," page 234). But I also found the same record in Volume 3 of the "Former Collection of Records of Distinguished Ministers of the Song Dynasty." It records Xiang Minzhong (向敏中) (whose courtesy name was Changzhi 常之, he served as Prime Minister during the reign of Emperor Zhenzong 眞宗): "When the Duke Xiang Minzhong was in Xijing, a monk asked a villager for lodging one evening, but the owner refused. The monk asked to sleep in the carriage outside the door, and the owner agreed. At night, a thief broke into the villager's house, helping a woman and her clothes over the wall to escape. The monk happened to be awake and saw this. He thought to himself, 'Since the owner didn't allow me to stay, and now the owner has lost his wife and property, he will definitely arrest me and take me to the county official tomorrow.' So he fled in the night, running into the wilderness and falling into a well. The woman had already been killed by the thief and was already in the well. The next day, the owner searched and found the monk in the well, arrested him, and tortured him. The monk falsely confessed, saying, 'I had an affair with my daughter-in-law and lured her away to escape. Fearing that she would be discovered, I killed her and threw her into the well. I lost my footing in the dark and also fell in.' The stolen goods were lost by the well, and he didn't know who took them. The case was closed, and the report was sent to the prefecture, but the prefecture didn't suspect anything. Only the Duke (referring to Xiang Minzhong) suspected that the stolen goods had not been recovered and interrogated the monk several times. The monk confessed, but said that he was destined to be responsible for this person's death in a previous life. The Duke persistently questioned him, and he finally told the truth. The Duke secretly sent an official to visit the thief. The official ate at a village shop, and the shopkeeper asked him if he came from the government office, not knowing that he was an official. She asked, 'What about the monk?' The official said, 'He has already been wrongly judged. Even if the thief is caught, he will not be questioned.' The old woman said, 'It doesn't hurt to tell you; the woman was killed by a young man in this village.' The official asked, 'Where is he?' The old woman pointed to his house, and the official arrested him there..." Isn't this exactly the story of "The Black-Clad Thief Commits Adultery, Murder, and Killing"?

Zhu Xi was a person of the Song Dynasty, and the "Records of Distinguished Ministers" he compiled would certainly not be untrue. Therefore, "The Black-Clad Thief Commits Adultery, Murder, and Killing" is truly a "story about public cases"! But, I don't have "Taiping Guangji" and other books on hand, otherwise, comparing these two "sources" would be interesting.

### Border Town Landscape Painting

— Yao Shenji

During the eight years of separation and chaos, so many people were kicked west and then kicked east. No one knew where they would end up. This year, fate arranged for me to go to Longling.

Longling is a border town in western Yunnan. It takes six or seven days by car from Kunming, passing through countless fields and villages, crossing the large iron bridge over the Nu River, and finally driving the car at full power to climb over the peak of Gaoligong Mountain. The road underneath is relatively convenient; just drive the car straight down the mountainside, and you can reach Longling.

Looking from afar, this city surrounded by towering mountains is just a desolate empty city. Walking in, you realize that it contains infinite excitement. The whole city has only one main street, with shops next to each other, and many stalls, with goods piled up like mountains, mostly colorful cans. These are all milk, coffee, Indian black tea, and British cigarettes imported from Burma. The shops also operate the exchange of "Rupees," with Burmese and English signs. Many shops have record players, constantly playing lively music, which is so pleasant and so charming.

Before coming, I had heard many absurd legends, saying that this place was already a miasma and rainy area. When I arrived, I realized that the mountains here are also green, the water is also beautiful, with lush forests and verdant rice paddies. The countryside is full of pleasant greenery everywhere. The language and clothing of the people are also the same as ours. They work diligently in the fields; some are doing business in an orderly manner, warmly greeting customers. Looking at this peaceful and tranquil scene, I also settled down with peace of mind.

This place just has too much rain, especially during the rainy season, it almost never stops raining for a day. When you go out, you clearly see a good day, but a heavy rain suddenly comes on the way, pouring down on you without warning. You always have to carry a raincoat and umbrella, and always wear a pair of galoshes on your feet. However, the rain falls very quickly, not as lingering as "Xiao Xiang Night Rain" (瀟湘夜雨). After a burst of heavy rain, a patch of azure sky is immediately revealed, and the sun smiles at the people on the road again. It is said that Longling's rain, Xiaguan's wind, and Baoshan's women are the three wonders of the Yunnan-Burma Road. I don't know how fierce Xiaguan's wind is or how beautiful Baoshan's women are, but I have experienced the power of Longling's rain.

In the past, the population was probably sparse. Once the Yunnan-Burma Road was opened, this small town became more and more prosperous day by day. Many rear-area institutions and companies set up stations and offices here. In addition, there were banks, post offices, tax bureaus, and checkpoints, resembling a prototype of a city. People, like the mud and sand in the Yellow River, all flocked to this place. Among them were a few "fools" who really served for the War of Resistance, and most of them were smart gold prospectors who came to fill their own pockets. New buildings were added every day, and countless city signs swayed in the wind. No business was bad; some signs had not even been hung up yet, and customers had already poured in. There are no electric lights here. For the convenience of supplying oil from Burma, every household has gasoline lamps, which are more lively at night than during the day. Waking up from a dream in the middle of the night, you can still hear the trucks roaring on the road.

Most of the people living in this city are wanderers thousands of miles away from home. They feel a little lonely in their hearts, and when they are free, they gather in coffee shops to pass the time. Fortunately, everyone is a fellow traveler in the world, and it is easy to get close when talking. At first, they only nod to each other, but after a long time, they greet each other like old friends. There are no movies, no dramas, and no famous attractions here. Apart from eating, there is almost no enjoyment of life to speak of. But the food that is available is so little, mostly canned food imported from abroad. Only one kind of "Erkuai" (餌塊) can be considered a local specialty, a bit like fried rice cakes in the Southeast, and the taste is indeed delicious. It is said that during the Qianlong period, a general who led troops to conquer Myanmar was hungry in Longling one night. Someone fried a portion for him, and he ate it with great satisfaction. When he returned, he asked the emperor for a reward, which the people of Longling are very proud of.

Here, you don't see many women. There is a young girl in a small restaurant. This girl has not received any education and is not very beautiful. She has some freckles on her face. In the city, no one would pay her much attention, but in this place without women, she is praised like a princess. Many people rush to her house to eat, just to peek at the smile lines on her eyes. A college student who counts money in the bank once wrote her a "Hu Shih style" love poem with his accounting pen. Later, this woman became the wife of a driver.

When everyone was paying attention to rising prices, happily eating, drinking, and guessing fingers in the hotel, and indulging in decadent music... the enemy's iron hooves rushed over. The flames of war spread from Burma to the border town. Fortunately, a group of people evacuated quickly, escaping the embrace of death. The enemy occupied the border town for more than a year. Later, we finally managed to snatch it back. Today, Longling is our territory again. I don't know what it will be like again: it will definitely lose its past prosperity, but it will not be as absurd as it used to be.

### Recent World Literary Scene

— Zhao Jingshen

Greek Poet in England

Demetrios Capetanakis was a young Greek poet who was invited to England by the British Senate in 1939. He died of illness at the age of thirty-two. During his short life in England, he left a deep impression on his English friends such as Edith Sitwell, John Lehmann, and William Plomer. He also wrote some very interesting poems and essays in English.

These poems and essays, along with the eulogies of his friends, are all collected in a recently published book "Capetanakis: A Greek Poet in England". There is a photo in front. Ms. Sitwell's eulogy reads: "The concentration of meaning it conveys is amazing, with a dazzling glow, narrating a terrible darkness."

Apart from talking about his beloved modern Greek poetry, Capetanakis always felt that life was dark. He talked about the writers of England, France, Germany, and Russia, believing that darkness was more than light. He talked about the English female writer Charlotte Brontë, saying that she had loved the headmaster of the school where she taught.

His articles on English poets are not badly written. The one about the great German poet Stefan George can be said to be a special autobiography. When talking about his own writer Panayotis Canellopoulo, he said that Capetanakis once loved reading George's works for a period of time, but later fiercely attacked George's writings. He said that George used poetry as a tool to attract his friends to him.

The best articles in the collection are his on Proust, Dostoevsky, and Rimbaud, especially the one on Rimbaud. He still uses his usual method to simplify the writer's attitude towards life. This new simplification seems to be more valuable for Rimbaud. He said that Rimbaud carefully went from pleasant to unpleasant. Pleasantness is a form of comfort. People indulge in fantasy and deny the terrible reality in front of them. After being fascinated by the magic of pleasure for a short period of time, he stopped indulging in pleasure in 1870. He faced reality with courage.

Indeed, people seek pleasure, but pleasure is blind. Art seeks truth and real-life experiences, but unpleasantness is also a path that artists want to explore. This is the "terrible darkness" that Sitwell spoke of. That is where Capetanakis's genius lies.

The poems he wrote are all psychological descriptions. He is very good at grasping the English language. If there are any mistakes, they should be seen as novel and attractive forces, rather than discordant. One of them, "Abel", would be worthy of being placed in a modern English poetry anthology.

Recently, John Galsworthy's "The Forsyte Saga" volumes 1-11 have been published by Soviet British literature researchers. There are many translators, and the chief translator is M. Lorye. Both volumes are decorated by the artist E. Kogan.

Sean O'Casey, an Irish writer, "I Knock at the Door" has also been published by the Moscow National Literary Publishing Department. Another piece, "Pictures in the Hallway," is also attached after "I Knock at the Door". Both of these are part of a larger work, which is obviously not yet completed and is autobiographical in nature. The translator is Kasijin, who specializes in English and American literature.

Introduction to Russian Novels

We say that the history of Russian novels is almost equal to the history of Russian literature, which is probably not far from wrong. The influence of Russian novels on European countries is really too great.

Janko Lavrin, a professor of literature at Nottingham University College, and an author of studies on Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, has recently published "Introduction to the Russian Novel." This book was published in London in 1942; the current New York edition has added a final chapter, "World War II and After." This book is the manuscript of his lectures, so the writing is very smooth.

There is a brief introduction in the front, using ten pages to talk about novels before the nineteenth century. Unfortunately, it does not mention the influence of Western culture on Russian novels in the eighteenth century, as well as the characteristics of Russian novels themselves.

The author regards Pushkin and Gogol as the origin of Russian realistic novels. But according to Belinsky, the naturalist school of Russian novels should have originated from Dostoevsky, not Gogol.

This book states that after 1880, the great writers had reached the end, and it was just like opening a bibliography, listing some names of people and books, with a little introduction attached. When it comes to Soviet novels, a new situation is changed, and a lively atmosphere is shown again.

### My Wish

— Anonymous

I wish to turn into a thornless rose
Letting the raging wind and rain crush me
As long as I can kiss your toes
Forever and ever, never leaving your side
I wish to turn into a melodious nightingale
Even if I vomit all my heart's blood
As long as it always makes your heart warm
Always pouring out unchanging love
I wish to turn into a passionate sunlight
Even if my body turns to ashes
As long as I can always warm your heart
Comforting the pain and sorrow of your soul
Sadly, I am just a gorgeous silkworm chrysalis
Spitting out all my emotions
Sealed in my self-woven cocoon
There is no freedom and no light
All expectations are just in vain
A spring dream that leads only to silence

### Soliloquy

— Guo Tian

Dusk

Lately, I've enjoyed taking long walks, watching the setting sun glisten on the river; crimson maple leaves flutter in the evening breeze...

White sails return with dusk, oars hitting the water, creating a string of bubbles that burst quickly. The figure of the boatman is stretched very long on the water, completely like a bamboo pole. The firelight reddens the haggard face of the boatwoman, and there is the aroma of rice in the air.

Dusk quietly returns; there are twinkling stars in the sky and twinkling lights on the ground. Songs begin to vibrate in the space, very rough and very moving. The songs of people living by the water have the rhythm of flowing water. The songs of boatmen who work all day are a release of fatigue!

Farmers return from the fields, washing their muddy feet by the river; "The days are short, you can't get any work done!" A sigh of exhaustion.

"Damn it, the wheat that was just planted was eaten by wild birds!"

"Autumn wind rises, the weather is getting cold. The leaky thatched roof hasn't been repaired yet."

Shoulders bearing heavy hoes, they disappear into different corners.

In the dusk, I walk, casually picking up a few red leaves from the ground. I seem to feel a little warmth! I think, this is the heart of suffering people.

Dusk gives my emotions a melancholic color. Without the light of the setting sun, the black hand of night reaches out to the world. But when night comes, there is also firelight!

The reeds by the river are burning with wildfire...

Chrysanthemum

Thanks to a friend for sending me a pot of chrysanthemums. The shabby room has a bit of elegance after a little decoration.

Spring is the season for flowers; red, blue, purple, white... smiles of flowers everywhere, indulging in the hot kisses of bees. Embraced by the spring breeze, absorbing the warmth of the sun; however, I do not love the flowers in spring, because their lives lack the tenacious spirit of resistance. A gust of autumn frost and a few winds and rains will give their lives to the ruthless flow of water...,

Autumn, paulownia leaves fall, wild geese sing sadly, a string of days full of loneliness and desolation! However, the beautiful chrysanthemums bloom proudly in the autumn wind, bringing joy to people's hearts.

There are several wintersweet plants and a row of white chrysanthemums planted in the small garden behind the house. My preference for chrysanthemums and plum blossoms is nothing more than love for their tenacious spirit in the wind and snow. The great autumn scenery, lingering by the flowers; or admiring chrysanthemums under the snow, a cup of clear tea, has sent away a lot of time, but those are the days of the past.

In the midst of war and chaos, I have lived a wandering life for a long time. Now the small garden behind the house is a desolate garden overgrown with weeds. In the heart of a traveler who is a guest away from home, only a warm memory remains.

Facing the pot of chrysanthemums on the desk, I use a brush to depict her charm and paint on my emotions...

### Eight Immortals Cave

— Ye Dingluo

— Travels in Jia Prefecture

I live on the west bank of the Min River, and to visit the so-called Eight Immortals Cave here, I must cross the river to the east bank. Accompanied by Di, I took some spare change and walked towards the Yidu (ferry) port at the edge of the market. The so-called Yidu in the past was originally an act of charity. At a certain port of a river, some people cursed while steering small boats, sailing lightly through dangerous waves, disregarding their own lives, and at the same time taking the opportunity to solicit fares from passengers. They often sacrificed many lives. Later, some people came forward, gathered money from many people, built larger boats, and hired reliable boatmen to steer them. For those who had to cross the water, they did not charge a fare, but they could cross safely. This practice was a public service. In Jia Prefecture, which is still a morning-industry society, it provides absolute convenience for tourists crossing the river.

The Min River is not wide, and it is often as calm as a mirror, so the ferry is just an ordinary long plank boat. Except for a small cabin at the stern for the boatman to store his meals and bedding, there are no other structures on the boat. The boatman only needs to use the bamboo poles a few times when leaving and approaching the shore. In the middle of the river, he uses a wooden pole as an oar, inserting it into a wooden pillar, and rowing dozens of times to cross. Therefore, passengers and boatmen sitting on the boat feel as if nothing is happening. But the dock on the other side is quite high. It is conceivable that in summer, when there is a heavy rain and water rushes down from the nearby mountains, the Min River will also widen and surge with temporary waves. We struggled to walk up the riverbank and walked forward along the road at the foot of the mountain. Before long, we turned into a winding mountain path with lush trees. The Eight Immortals Cave is on the not-very-high mountaintop, but we still had to climb more than a hundred stone steps, and several hills.

Using bricks, we scared off the dogs of the villagers halfway up the mountain, and continued to climb the mountain. Amidst the dense forests and bamboo, buildings were revealed, including stone platforms and pavilions, a small-scale architectural complex. This was already the Eight Immortals Cave.

The story of the Eight Immortals is a Taoist myth. I think its meaning is nothing more than using the lifestyles of eight people to symbolize a carefree life that is not responsible for anything. These eight people are not entirely fictional. Although their backgrounds and experiences are different, they have all seen through everything and returned to their original state, living naturally according to their interests and hobbies, without competing with the world, and each living out their years. Therefore, they are called immortals. God is wisdom, and immortality is nature. Living a lifetime with wisdom and nature, that is an immortal. This is probably the true meaning of the Eight Immortals. However, the naming of this Eight Immortals Cave is probably unrelated to the original characters and meaning, but rather a place for monks to earn their living, like a dilapidated government office, with officials gone and buildings empty, leaving behind incompetent petty officials, keeping the old chess and card seals, and begging for money from tourists. But after all, a temple is better than a government office because it has some property. So here, it is painted very freshly. An old monk with a wine-stained nose came out of the old wooden house built against the mountain. Two bowls of clear tea made us sit on the stone platform facing the river in front of the main hall. The main hall is actually a vault of mountain stones with彩漆 painted Buddha statues inside. It seems that there are few people who come here to offer incense, and more who drink tea. Therefore, the Buddha statue has become a beautiful decoration, with the meaning of a large children's toy. And this so-called Eight Immortals Cave, which should have been a blessed place, a place of seclusion from the world, has also become a corner of society. However, being able to have half a day of leisure, drinking clear tea here, chatting with the old monk, and looking out at the Min River behind the green bamboo, hearing the barking of dogs in the mountains and the voices of people among the trees, and thinking of some people who died in the war, also gives me the comfort of being an immortal for a few hours.

I had the idea of staying here, but the monk said that some of the empty rooms were already occupied by soldiers. The wine-nosed monk, smoking a long pipe, filled with leaf tobacco, spoke entirely in the tone of an old party member. High prices, difficult life, and coping with distress were the center of the conversation. He was also struggling to make a living. Indeed, where in this world are there people who truly live in seclusion from the world? Shaving one's head only saves a little trouble on oneself. As I was leaving, I took out some tea money. He resolutely refused to accept it, but I resolutely gave it to him because, when paper money is still somewhat useful, I am sometimes still afraid of people who do not want money.

Crossing the river from the original ferry, sitting on the plank boat, I saw the setting sun shining on the boatman's bare body, wearing patched shorts. Talking to him, I learned that he was only earning the money I gave him, which he calculated was not enough to eat his fill. But he had the health that we envied. Jun said that the health of sailors is because they are nourished by "sunlight," "air," and "water" all year round, which makes a lot of sense. But, isn't "eating" also very necessary?

### Ode to the Pastoral

— Wen Jie

It has been more than ten years since I returned to my hometown; this time, returning to my village, I approached my old home with a joyful and hurried heart. Seeing a long row of oleanders in front of the door, already over ten feet tall, I felt strange: who would have the leisure and interest to plant oleanders in front of the door during the years of war and chaos? Upon entering the door, I asked my family who planted the row of trees in front of the door? My family, hearing my question, laughed and said, "Didn't you plant them yourself?" Then I suddenly remembered that I had indeed planted trees more than ten years ago. The saplings were taken from a relative's house. At that time, they were no more than three or five inches tall, but now they are over ten feet tall. Thinking about how I have lived more than ten years in a muddled way, and today I am still the same as before, with no progress to speak of, while those three- or five-inch saplings, during my muddled days, have grown into a row of tall and lush trees, it is truly a stark contrast. I also thought: why do trees thrive in the process of more than ten years, while human affairs often fail to progress? Considering the reasons, it is probably because the growth of trees is left to nature, while human affairs often encounter complications and many obstacles.

The noise of the city and the quiet of the countryside also form a stark contrast. Especially at night, the whole village can be said to have entered a state of silence, so quiet that one can only hear the sound of silence in one's ears. I don't know if it's because there are no pedestrians at night, or if the villagers can't afford to raise dogs after several years of war, but one can't hear the sound of dogs barking in the village at night. Of course, the quiet of rural life and the noise of urban life are only superficial. In the city, although we see people bustling and carriages and horses flowing, forming a noisy mass, but in the depths of people's hearts, there is inevitably a sense of indifference; even in neighborhood life, aren't neighbors each for themselves, unrelated to each other? As for rural life, under the current circumstances, how can the villagers live a truly quiet life? Therefore, in the countryside, it is quiet on the surface, but tension is still inevitable at its core. It's just that, comparatively speaking, the unnecessary hustle and bustle that is common in the city is not present in rural life. The tension of the villagers is often due to the environment, and it is passive, while the tension in the city is mostly due to self-disturbance.

In recent years, a method of "cooperative pig raising" has become popular among the residents of my village. This is a kind of rural economics that is not found in economic treatises, and it is worth mentioning. Around April or May, the villagers begin to raise pigs, but the main food for pigs—bran—has become an expensive thing amid the rising prices of everything, so some people want to raise pigs, but feel that the burden is too heavy and they can't afford it. Therefore, they came up with a cooperative method: for example, if your family gets bran when milling rice and feels that you don't have any other needs, you can provide the remaining bran to the pig-raising families every month to feed the pigs. You agree with them that you will supply a certain amount of food every month, then a certain portion of that pig will belong to you. When the twelfth lunar month is coming to an end and the new year is approaching, you can slaughter the pig and get a certain portion of pork. The author believes that this method is extremely reasonable. This can also be said to be one of the rural economic moods in an economically turbulent situation.

Rural life in this turbulent era is certainly not as peaceful as it used to be, but I always feel that it is more lovely and realistic than urban life. A large part of urban life, we can really only call it "emptiness." When residents of American cities feel disgusted with urban life, they often feel like they want to "get away from it all" and decide to move to quiet places in the countryside to live. Some commentators say that this is escaping reality. According to the author, this is just escaping emptiness, not escaping reality. Moreover, those Americans who move to remote mountains and isolated villages are not doing it for laziness, but are still living a laborious Robinson Crusoe-style life. Chinese scholars have always admired pastoral life, but apart from Tao Yuanming's "Returning Home," a short lyrical essay, there are probably very few works about pastoral life; while in recent years, the American publishing industry has indeed published a lot of such works, including several thick tomes, one of which is "The Egg and I," which was made into a movie.

Recently, I have been wanting to get rid of the empty life in the city and go to a remote mountain village to live a pastoral life of self-cultivation and self-weaving, as described by Mencius in the style of Xu Xing. There is no poetry to be spoken of in such a life. According to my fantasy, it would be best to have a slope of mountain land that is not too steep and not too flat, planting some peaches, plums, melons, and fruits; at the foot of the mountain, it would be best to have a few acres of morning fields, planting some rice, wheat, and cotton; and then raising some chickens, ducks, cows, and pigs, and if the agricultural products obtained are more than enough for our own use, then we can exchange them for daily necessities such as soap and candles; and build a few thatched cottages on the flat land in the mountains, taking the old and young to live there, working at sunrise and resting at sunset. Such a life can probably be worthy of ourselves and worthy of the people. This is my ideal "Shangri-La in the world."

### Calculating "Fate" and Calculating "Wealth"

— Bai Chu

The number of fortune-tellers in Shanghai is simply astonishing. There are "True Left Hands" living in grand hotels, and "Atomic Fortune-telling Doctors" from abroad; below them are "Great Differences" and "Zhang Tie Kou" setting up stalls on the roadside; and even in the alleys of small vegetable markets, hanging a mask diagram and acting as fortune-tellers who determine the fate of others.

Although I have never consulted them, I understand the "philosophy" of fortune-tellers. Based on the zodiac, the hour of birth, the five wealth attributes of the face, and the lines on the hands, they can calculate your future success or failure. They tell you when you will have good luck, and how many years this good luck will last. If you do business at this time, you will definitely make money and become a boss; if you become an official, they guarantee that you will be promoted and become a big official with some kind of title. They also urge you not to move rashly in a certain year, because the year is unfavorable and you are likely to lose your official position and lose money. They have calculated that the "fate" of famous historical figures is good, so they hang it up as a demonstration; as for beggars and coolies, they are born to be miserable.

In fact, to put it bluntly, calculating "fate" is calculating "wealth." The goodness or badness of "fate" is the amount of "wealth." When you have good luck is when you get rich—as for promotion, they seem to think it's just for getting rich—how many years of good luck you have means how many years you can get rich and enjoy good fortune. Fortune-tellers can only indicate this! (Why don't fortune-tellers get rich themselves? No one would think of this question.)

The Chinese people's enthusiasm for worshiping the God of Wealth is rare in the world, and the Chinese people's judgment of people based on wealth is also rare in the world. In theory, a person's value does not lie in whether they are a boss, manager, big official, or small clerk, worker. However, the Chinese believe that having money means having everything, and the more wealth you accumulate, the higher your social status and the greater your fame, becoming an object of envy; no one will investigate the morals and knowledge of this rich man, or whether he obtained his wealth through proper means. The expression of this ideology is especially severe in Shanghai: wearing a well-tailored suit can get you convenience everywhere; if you wear a blue cloth gown, you are likely to be subjected to scorn. Coupled with the temptation of high material enjoyment, it further stimulates people to want to get rich.

Understanding this, you know why the Chinese love fortune-telling, why Shanghai, such a large city with a high level of culture, has such an abnormally developed fortune-telling industry, and why fortune-tellers are the darlings of heaven in the present day, just because they can calculate how much wealth you can accumulate!

### In Praise of Selfishness

— Yi Jun

Yang Zhu's advocacy of "not doing it even if it benefits the world by plucking a hair" is, I don't know, merely non-aggression, or still wanting to pluck other people's hair to benefit oneself? If he cherishes his own hair and at the same time can respect other people's hair, then even if it is selfish and self-interested, the world can be peaceful. What a pity is that in order to benefit themselves, people do not hesitate to pluck all the hair of the people in the world. If plucking hair is not enough, they still want to skin them, eat their flesh, and drink their blood. How can the world not be chaotic?

It can be seen that selfishness and self-interest are not absolutely bad things. On the one hand, they can make the world peaceful, and on the other hand, they can lead to great chaos in the world, just as water can be used for drinking and irrigation, but it can also flood houses, and fire can be used for warming and cooking, but it can also burn down cities. But in reality, mankind has not benefited from it, and the disasters they have suffered are far worse than those suffered from floods and flames.

Mankind is known as the essence of all things, but it is pitiful that in this respect, they are just as insensitive as other things, and sometimes even more insensitive. Just imagine, if you harm others for your own benefit, would others be willing to be harmed by you honestly? Similarly, others will harm you for their own benefit! This is why the world's deadliest weapons have the greatest achievements in all sciences. In this way, on a small scale, everyone is constantly scheming and secretly calculating each other, and is constantly in danger of being secretly calculated; on a large scale, countries are constantly preparing for war and fighting each other, and there is a daily threat of war. The result is: the purpose of harming others has been achieved, and the evil cause of harming oneself has been created. This is all due to a foolish, cruel, cowardly, and selfish view of self-interest.

Wise selfishness and self-interest are aimed at the happiness and interests of all mankind. Once mankind is blessed and benefited, you are also a member of mankind, and you will naturally be among those who are blessed and benefited. Therefore, the so-called seeking the welfare of mankind is actually nothing more than a means of pursuing selfishness and self-interest, but this is wise, and therefore stable.

Benevolent selfishness and self-interest not only do not infringe on the welfare of others to benefit oneself, but also have a benevolent heart of "feeling pain when others drown and feeling hungry when others are hungry," and even sacrifice oneself to save others, and feel at peace in one's heart. This kind of self-sacrificing behavior is to relieve one's own guilt and satisfy one's own joy of helping others. It is also a kind of selfishness and self-interest, but this is benevolent, and therefore noble.

Courageous selfishness and self-interest is to seize benefits from nature, such as overcoming disease and death, opening up mountains, rivers, and lakes, driving away poisonous snakes and beasts, resisting hurricanes and rainstorms, developing material science... This is to treat all things as straw dogs, and of course it is selfish and self-interested; but this kind of struggle to seize benefits from nature is more difficult and greater than the struggle between people, and there is absolutely great courage. And the benefits that we exploit and seize are inexhaustible and inexhaustible in nature.

When will mankind abandon foolish, cruel, and cowardly selfishness and self-interest, and transform into wise, benevolent, and courageous selfishness and self-interest? For the sake of selfishness and self-interest, I hope that such a time will come soon.

### Wandering Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter One: Striving to Remedy (24)

Yunqing said, "Of course I have intentions in this. I am planning for you. Now, this is the only way to go. Your going back is most beneficial to you." Zhuzhai said, "I can't go back. I can't live in that family!" Yunqing said, "Then what are you planning to do?" Zhuzhai said, "I want to leave Beiping and fly far away!" Yunqing said, "So you still want to go to Shanghai to find Qihuan, right?" Zhuzhai lowered his head upon hearing these words, and shook his head slightly, saying, "No! Seeing her may not have any results. I plan to wander for the rest of my life." Yunqing said, "You just said you wanted to be a monk, and now you're talking about wandering outside. These are not serious words. You'll regret these emotional words later. Now you have to change your mood. Don't look at Fengsheng so annoyingly. Just think of her as a strong and capable woman. You work hard outside and entrust the family to her. You won't have any worries. At your age now, you should also move forward in your career. Don't always be spinning in the circle of love. Now I plan to write a letter to Fengsheng to explain for you. Will you go back and try again?" Zhuzhai said, "If you had done this last night, it would have been possible, but now if you call me to go, I feel sad in my heart." Yunqing said, "Then let's do this. You go back first, and after I've settled things with Fengsheng, I'll tell you." Zhuzhai said, "My intention today is not for this. What I mean is that I hope our previous goals can be achieved. If we can, we'll proceed. If we can't, I'll leave Beiping. I hope you can give me a clear answer." Yunqing said, "I don't agree with you leaving Beiping. You can't achieve your previous goals either!" Zhuzhai said, "Then what do you want me to do?" Yunqing said, "I can't give you an answer right now either. Anyway, I have a good idea. Listen for a letter in a day or two." Zhuzhai saw that he had bothered Yunqing for a long time with no results, and stood up disappointedly, saying, "Take good care of your health! Don't worry about my affairs. I'll probably leave Beiping in a few days." Yunqing saw his expression and didn't say anything, watching him go downstairs. Zhuzhai returned to his dormitory, thinking that he had been rejected on both sides. Now he had to find a way to jump out of this city of Beiping to avoid mental distress. To leave Beiping, there are only two ways: one is to find a job in a bank and be sent out, wherever they send him is fine, to change the environment; the other is to find his old classmate Li Xiaosong, who has a good position in Nanjing, and it shouldn't be a problem to have him find a small job. However, how to explain it to his parents if he were to leave Beiping forever is a difficult problem.

### On Associative Power

— Xu Jinjin

According to zoologists' research, mice do not have extraordinary intelligence, but only associative power, but their cleverness or cunning seems quite impressive. Professor Watson of Johns Hopkins University in the United States once conducted an interesting experiment.

On a flat surface, he arranged a maze with many crisscrossing and complex piles. Many crooked paths were impassable. He placed a piece of cheese in the center, and then took out a mouse that had been hungry for several hours and placed it at the entrance of the maze.

Afterwards, Professor Watson left the room and looked in from a window where the mouse could not see or smell him. He took out a pocket watch, a pencil, and a piece of paper to record the mouse's scurrying around. After smelling the cheese, the mouse was extremely excited and scurried from the main road to the small paths, got lost in the winding forks, and then returned to the main road, and in a moment broke into another winding small path. In short, it took a total of sixteen minutes to obtain the cheese.

So Professor Watson took the mouse out, and the next day placed it in the same place. Now the mouse only took fourteen minutes to obtain the cheese, and it had recognized several "no through road" roads and was no longer fooled. To put it simply, in the thirtieth test, the mouse only took six seconds to scurry to the location of the cheese.

The above experiment can provide an annotation for the Chinese idiom "practice makes perfect." From the mouse's point of view, it is also a corroboration of "failure is the mother of success." However, the focus of this article is not here, but on explaining the breadth and interest of associative power.

For example, the dripping of water in a pot and the falling of an apple seem unrelated to the steam engine and the law of gravity, but Watt and Newton, with their rich associative power, created new theories and deserve to be pioneers of modern civilization.

Secondly, seeing an object and thinking of a person often makes people feel endless emotions, and "seeing an object and thinking of an object" is also a common occurrence. When I eat out, I see the leftover bones and scraps of food, or the fish bones piled on the table, and I think of the fat-headed and fat-brained little white cat that I keep at home. The scene of it wagging its tail and begging for food is as if it were right in front of me. Naturally, I would not wrap the fish bones in paper and bring them back, but it seems a pity to throw them away.

Sometimes, I really like to read the current affairs cartoons in books, newspapers, and magazines. Recently, in a certain publication, I saw a black and white painting depicting a soldier symbolizing a certain country, drinking a bottle of inflation wine, and his body was huge, floating in the air like a balloon. I myself, like everyone else, have no experience of floating in the air, and it is quite difficult to experience this feeling. With my associative power, the most I can think of is the feeling of floating in the bathtub when bathing, which may be similar.

Also, when I send out manuscripts, in order to avoid the pages being reversed or scattered, in addition to pasting them with paste, I mostly use small paper clips to clip them together. When using paper clips, I often think of the person opening the letter, and if they are not careful, the tip of the clip may puncture their finger. Therefore, I always clip the tip of the clip to the back of the manuscript to ensure safety. Although I have no way of knowing whether the editors have noticed these small details, I think it can avoid the small misfortune of pricking their fingers.

Finally, I think of the many talented and intelligent people in the world, such as genius mathematicians, who can find the answers to complex problems in just one or two minutes, and genius musicians who can master various instruments and write beautiful and pleasing melodies. ... One of the reasons may be that their associative power is particularly developed. If we still take mathematicians as an example, their brains are like complex calculators, which can add, subtract, multiply, and divide at the same time, unlike ordinary people who first add and then subtract, or first multiply and then divide. Other than this, it seems quite difficult to find other appropriate explanations for the genius's extraordinary understanding.

### European Ancient Costumes

— Mao Yi

From the excavations in the peat bogs of Northern Europe, we can trace back to the strange ancient costumes of Europeans in the Iron Age, 1500 years ago.

The clothes excavated from these bogs often still contain the bones of the wearer, or are wrapped around shrunken, terrifying corpses. Both the corpses and the clothes tell us a lot about the lives of Europeans long ago.

The men of that era wore short trousers, fastened with a belt; the shirts on their upper bodies resembled the vests of Western women today, some with sleeves and some without. When it was cold, they added a coat that wrapped around them, decorated with tassels, and fastened with a hook. They wore spiral leggings on their lower bodies. The shoes were made of leather, soft on the inside, with the fur exposed on the outside, not scraped off.

Few women's clothes have been excavated from the bogs, and most of those excavated are woolen clothes, with excellent weaving techniques, the whole garment being like a single piece. The colors are mostly black and blue. It is speculated that women at that time mainly wore hemp, but hemp is difficult to preserve in the bogs, so it has all decayed without a trace.

More than fifty corpses of men, women, and children have been excavated from the bogs of Denmark, northern Germany, and Ireland, most of which are male corpses. It is generally believed that most of the people who were sunk into the bogs were death row inmates sentenced according to the laws of the Iron Age. A few may have been victims of assassins and murderers, who buried them in the bogs to cover their tracks.

### Remembering Mr. Huang Binhong

— Yu Jianhua

Currently, there are elderly painters in Shanghai over the age of eighty, namely Yao Yuqin and Quan, and in Beiping, there are Qi Baishi and Huang Binhong. I knew Mr. Huang Binhong twenty years ago, during the fifteenth year of the Republic of China. My old friend Wang Jihuan ran the Wang Family Printing House near Zhangjia Garden on Avenue Edward VII, publishing the "Ding Zhoukan" art weekly. I published the "Mo Yuan Ban Yuekan" in Jinan, and also submitted paintings to be published in "Ding Zhoukan."

Binhong happened to live at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue du Consulat, in a dormitory of the Zhengyin Bookstore. He saw my paintings and thought I was his old friend Yu Jianhua from Taicang, so he sent me a long letter, expressing his feelings of separation. I replied, explaining the situation and expressing my gratitude. That summer, I came to Shanghai and stayed in the Wang Family Printing House. I was only a stone's throw away from Mr. Binhong, so we often visited each other and became friends despite the age difference. On the Double Ninth Festival of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Binhong guided me to Taicang to meet Yu Jianhua with the same name and surname. We enjoyed poetry and wine together, and the gathering was very lively.

Around the eighteenth and nineteenth years of the Republic of China, my old friend Zhang Shanzi and his younger brother Daqian lived in Xicheng Lane on Ximen Road. Mr. Binhong, through my introduction, rented an upstairs room. Xiong Songquan and my old friend Ma Qizhou both lived in Yongyu Lane, not far away. Later, I also moved to Xihu Fang, next to Yongyu Lane, facing Xicheng Lane. I then invited my old friends Chen Gangshu and Cai Yimin, along with eight people, to form the Rotten Cartoon Society. Mr. Binhong was the oldest, and Daqian was the youngest. Later, Mr. Binhong took over the Shenzhou Guoguang Society for a period of time, and moved to Fenyang Lane on Avenue Foch. The Shenzhou Guoguang Society was originally founded by Deng Qiumei, specializing in collotype printing of ancient books, paintings, rubbings, and compiling and printing the Shenzhou Guoguang Ji, Shenzhou Daguan, and art series. Mr. Binhong was involved in many of these matters. When Mr. Binhong took over, he originally intended to continue the art publishing business, but it soon changed in nature. The person in charge instead devoted himself to the social sciences of historical materialism, and Mr. Binhong quietly withdrew.

Mr. Binhong went north to Beiping in the twenty-sixth year, intending to take a position at the Palace Museum, but shortly after, the July 7th Incident occurred. He quickly settled in the ancient capital and could not return south. He closed his doors to write books and paint, not asking about outside affairs, and his life was extremely difficult. Mr. Binhong was frugal in his daily life, had no hobbies, could drink but never got drunk. In the twenty years I knew him, I never saw him suffer from any serious illness. In addition to studying calligraphy and painting, he also liked to collect bronze seals, using their characters to verify the bronze inscriptions and Shuowen Jiezi. He accumulated a collection more than a foot high, but unfortunately, it was never published. Most of his paintings are landscapes, based on traveling ten thousand miles and reading ten thousand volumes. Although he often wrote about scenery, he ultimately expressed his own feelings. However, in recent years, his works have used too much ink, seeming to lack clarity and sparseness. Yesterday, I read in the newspaper that Mr. Binhong had lost sight in one eye. I am in the north, thinking of my old friend, and I hope the news is not accurate.

### Fan Shi-hu's Diary

— Chen Gao

Fan Shi-hu, whose given name was Zhineng and styled himself Shi-hu Jushi. He was a Jinshi in the twenty-fourth year of the Shaoxing era. Three kinds of his diaries have been published. They are Jiaosui Lu, Cuanlu, and Wuchuan Lu. According to the History of the Song Dynasty: "When he was an envoy to the Jin dynasty, he initially presented a letter, his words and tone were impassioned, determined to deliver the letter and return to his residence, and he ultimately preserved his integrity and returned." Jiaosui Lu records what he saw and heard during his mission to the Jin dynasty in the sixth year of the Qiandao era. In that year, Cheng Da was appointed as Grand Academician of Zizheng Hall, and Kang Kui, the Commissioner of Chongxin Jiedu, was appointed as his deputy as envoy to the Great Jin Kingdom. The diary also begins in the fifth month (leap) and ends in the eighth month. It meticulously records the routes, customs of the Jin envoys, exchange rates, and palace facilities, expressing his ambition to pacify the world. For example, on the days of Gengwu and Guimao, he described the lamentations of the remaining people for their nation and the envoys' emotional tears, which were truly vivid. It is capable of inspiring national righteousness, and its purpose is abundant. Guimao's record states: "Passing by Youhe, there is Youli City above, with four bottles standing like dignified residents. The woods are too full within. Woxiang Prefecture has Qin Lou, Cui Lou, Kangle Lou, and Yuebai Fengqing Lou, all of which are qiting. Qin Lou has a foreign woman, wearing a gold tower with large sleeves, with a gold tower and purple silk belt, she speaks the Northern language. It is said that she is a daughter of the royal family, from the prefectural governor's family. The remaining people often wipe their tears and sigh. The messenger said: 'These are people from the Chinese Buddhist country,' and many old women knelt and worshiped."

Next is Cuanlu, which records his journey from Wuxing to Guangxi as a commander between the years of Ren-chen and Gui-si. Reading it is like being in a winding, remote valley with a rushing, clear stream. Also, Wuchuan Lu describes his journey from Chengdu to Pingjiang when he was recalled as the Sichuan Zhizhi Envoy during the Chunxi Ding-you era. His eyes explored everything within dozens of miles, and his writing is often light and witty. For example, the record of the wonder of the eighty-four bends of Mount Emei and the strange illusions of the silver world. Li Ciming's Yue Mantang Diary says: "Reading Fan Shi-hu's Cuanlu... my mind wanders to Lipu and Guilin... Cuanlu's writing is already clumsy, far inferior to his Wuchuan Lu. However, apart from Lu You's Records of Entering Shu and Zhang Yunsou's Bin Xing Lu, there are few equals. The record mentions that the small hills and slopes on the banks of the Xiang River are endless and are all earthen hills. There is no intention of lofty peaks and beautiful ranges, but only desolation connected to each other. And after passing Hengshan, he also said that there is another layer of small hills; mountain people live in seclusion, and peach and plum blossoms are just blooming, looking like being on the road to Lin Gao. It is the same as Du Tong's poem: 'Flowers and trees are deep on both sides of the Xiang River,' only here is there meaning in the line." Thus, the depth of the Xiang River can also be generally seen.

### Human World

— He Tianjian

Reading Shu Fan's poem crying for He Yangling, I was deeply moved by the extraordinary grief and pain. In the autumn of the previous year, Shu Fan mentioned that he saw all of my works at Deng Sanmu's place and was eager to meet me. We were both too busy and could not fulfill this wish. Unexpectedly, he has now passed away. Humans are not immune to feelings of attachment. I composed two poems, hoping to express the same sorrow.

One cry breaks the string, three cries dim the eyes, such tears have long been absent in this world. Who would have thought that in this desolate and deserted land, the spirit of Qingfeng and darkness is not forgotten. A true friend is worthy of risking life and death, and how many grudges have there been between those who discuss their hearts since ancient times? Your poem should be read on Huangshan, with tigers and leopards ahead.

The pain of Qiuling's books is forever cut off, how could one know the fate of the other with just a glimpse? I wish I had the ability to control Li, but I lower my head to look at the sword and feel sad for Xu! If we trace back our family history, we should be from the same clan, and in vain, we share the same neighborhood in heaven and earth. I never followed your words, but in the west wind, I shook hands and met you.

### Recollections of Yu Lou

— Banmeng Laoren (Old Man Half-Dream)

The other day, Ling Jihan's article on Luoyang, the capital of the Central Plains in Henan, mentioned that Yu Quyuan was impeached and dismissed from his position as Education Commissioner of Henan and returned to his hometown. This made me think of Mr. Yu Quyuan, who was supervising education in Henan. He set the topics "Wang should quickly issue an order to rebel" and "The lord's wife Yang Huo desires," and was impeached and dismissed. However, in his poetry collection, he only said, "I inspected the Central Plains and was dismissed due to people's words," without mentioning this matter. He said: "Clouds and smoke pass by without a trace, it is good to return to the countryside and close the door, everything is right and wrong, let the officials discuss, and one official position is the emperor's favor." He also said: "Don't blame the rumors for being too groundless," which shows that the matter of setting the topic was probably just hearsay, and nothing more than someone trying to slander him. His wife also had the line "After taking off the court hat, the whole body feels light," which shows that her thoughts were pure and there was nothing to criticize. He also said: "It is difficult to be harmonious with the world if the edges and corners are not smoothed, and one can face the sky with a pure heart." The storms of officialdom can rise at any time, but harming him was actually beneficial to him. From then on, he indulged in the scenery of the lakes and mountains, and lived peacefully in the paradise-like places of Suzhou and Hangzhou, and wrote the book Qunjing Pingyi, becoming a major Confucian scholar of the Qing Dynasty.

He first taught at the Ziyang Academy in Suzhou, and later moved to teach at the Gujing Jingshe in Hangzhou, following Wang Lanquan and Sun Xingyan. Zeng Wenzhenggong once said that Yu Yinpu was a true scholar (Yinpu was Quyuan's given name), and also said that Li Shaoquan desperately sought officialdom, while Yu Yin desperately wrote books (Shaoquan was Li Hongzhang's given name), which shows that everyone at the time admired him, and his reputation was not in vain. His poem "Traveling to the Nine Creeks and Eighteen Gorges" says: "Layers upon layers of mountains, winding and circling roads, dong dong ding ding springs, high and low trees." The wording is ingenious and appropriate.

He wanted to imitate Li Fanxie's "Floating Plum Village" in West Lake, using huge bamboo as rafts, floating in the lake, building a thatched hut on the raft, with vermilion railings around it, setting up green curtains to open and close, laying wooden planks like a platform below, in which six or seven chairs, tables, wine cups, tripods, basins, tea stoves, chess sets, and other items could be placed, traveling back and forth in the lake, but in the end, he did not succeed. He only made a small raft in the Quyuan Garden in Suzhou, roughly in the same style, named "Small Floating Raft."

Later, the disciples of the Gujing Jingshe built a building for him at the foot of Gushan Mountain, west of the Liuyiquan Spring, with the Gushan Temple to the east, piling up ponds and rocks, named Yu Lou. His Yu Lou had four wonders: (1) Buddha wonder: He dreamed of an ancient Buddha not decorated with gold, entering through a jade green door, with a crane guarding the books below. (2) Immortal wonder: In the middle of the night, the lotus flowers in the lake bloomed greatly. He thought of getting a small boat to pick them, and suddenly two children came rowing a boat. He boarded the boat, went deep into the flowers, and returned with joy. When he returned, the children and the boat disappeared. (3) Divine wonder: He saw a light green frog on a pine tree, its whole body like a carved piece of jade, without any imperfections. He determined it to be the spirit of General Jinhua. (4) Ghost wonder: When Yu Lou was being built, he dreamed of a blue person coming from outside the west wall, bowing to people. The next time he saw a grave west of the building, a stone worker dreamed of a blue man, claiming to be the Ming Dynasty deputy general Wang Qingxiang, and instructed them not to offend him, so they changed the road to climb the mountain to avoid his tomb. The story spread like this, so I will just record it.

The small scenes of Yu Lou include Xiaoqu Garden, Qixia West House, Piaochi Pond, Banpo Pavilion, Lingsong Pavilion, Xiaopenglai Islet, Xishuang Pavilion, He Shou Xuan, Wenshi Pavilion, Quyuan Library, and Wenquan Spring. The two characters of his Yu Lou were written by Peng Gangzhigong Yulin. He said: "Tao Lu and Xie Xi are remembered for thousands of years, how can my name be worthy of mention? Walking to the end of Baisha Causeway, it turns out everyone knows Yu Lou."

Unexpectedly, his poetic intention became a topic of conversation. Last year, I traveled to West Lake with Yu Jingzhai. Jingzhai intended to borrow Yu Lou as a place to rest, because his surname was Yu, the same as the ancient one, and the building belonged to Yu, so there would be no objection. Who knew that when we visited the west side of Gushan, we could not find Yu Lou. Mr. Quyuan's so-called "Why bother to leave" could it be "not leaving at all!" Jingzhai once sent me a poem, saying: "Jade peaks and gold peaks connect to the distant sky, opening my robe, every step I take is pleasant. Looking again at the new autumn moon after three relocations, the soft light gently shakes the front of the Tuisheng Convent. (Tuisheng Convent, Peng Xueqin...)...Remember the spring gulls entering the distant river, the wild geese have come in pairs, floating life often makes the lake... (?), I have never been on Penglai and regret fills my chest. (referring to Xiaopenglai)" It is because Yu Lou has been rented to the Xinghua Restaurant, the elegant place has become a place for wine and meat, Mr. Quyuan would be worried and sad if he knew. Afterwards, I lived in the Ziyun Cave in the summer, and Jingzhai sent two more quatrains, saying: "I want to buy a few acres of land in West Lake, to build a hut to rest my body, in the morning mist and evening haze, my eyes look into the distance, after all, the green mountains belong to the old man. Jingxi is still marked with the Bixia Gate (Yu Lou has a Bixia Gate on the left), I am happy to see that the classics and decorations still exist. A red plum tree is still blooming (there is a red plum tree in front of Yu Lou, blooming in October, Peng Xueqin made a red plum painting for Quyuan.) The army is coming, let's get drunk in Xinghua Village (referring to Xinghua Restaurant)." There are many beautiful places in the lake, and Yu Lou can be rebuilt to decorate the lake and mountains. It is a pity that Mr. Quyuan was a generation of Confucian teachers, with numerous writings, and we are unable to preserve the famous sites he managed, leaving later generations with a feeling of emptiness!

### Reader Consultation

Legal Explanation: Wife is Immoral and Elopes with Someone Else; Husband is Affected and Intends to Divorce

A gentleman asks: I have been married for more than ten years, and the relationship between my wife and I is still fairly harmonious. However, due to economic difficulties, the relationship between us has become increasingly cold, and we often quarrel. In the past one or two years, my wife's behavior has become abnormal. Before, when I was out working, she once had an affair with someone (with love letters as evidence). Half a year later, she eloped with someone. Now I intend to publish a notice in the newspaper, setting a deadline for her to complete the divorce procedures and notify her family. I have a few questions, please answer them for me. (1) Can her previous love letters be presented as evidence of her affair? (2) Even if I publish a notice in the newspaper, setting a deadline for her to come forward to complete the divorce procedures, if she avoids meeting me, how should I deal with it? (3) Her parents have both passed away, does her brother have the right to represent the parents? (Her behavior is improper, and even after her brother persuaded her sincerely, she did not change. After this incident, I notified her brother, and received a reply stating that since things have come to this point, he will leave everything up to me.) If she does not come in person, and her brother agrees, can he represent her in terminating the marriage? (4) If items (3) cannot be implemented, what kind of procedures should be adopted to terminate the marriage?

[Legal Consultant Mr. Tang Ming Shi answers: (1)] Husband and wife should forgive each other. If one party commits a fault, and the other party forgives it, the previous matter is written off. Therefore, Article 245, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law stipulates that if a spouse forgives, they cannot prosecute. (2) Unilateral publication in the newspaper, even with a deadline, cannot be used as a basis for divorce. The so-called consensual divorce requires the consent of both husband and wife. See Articles 1049 and 1050 of the Civil Code. (3) The identity of husband and wife, their union and separation, even parents cannot represent them, let alone brothers. Therefore, if she does not express her opinion, her brother cannot represent her. (4) If an agreement cannot be reached, and the other party has a situation as described in Article 1052, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, you may request a divorce from the court.
