### Rigid Regulations on Adjustment of Salaries for Public Servants and Teachers Canceled

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 31st] After the President convened an important meeting on the evening of the 30th to make the final decisions in principle on the new supplementary measures for financial and economic reform, the temporary Executive Yuan meeting was convened at 9:00 AM on the 31st for discussion.

### US Aircraft Carrier Arrives in Qingdao; Not Intended to Withdraw US Troops, Says US Navy Spokesman

[United Press, Washington, 30th] A Navy Department spokesman said on the 30th: The arrival of the aircraft carrier "Tarawa" and the "Valley Forge" in Qingdao should not be interpreted as the United States intending to withdraw from Qingdao. He acknowledged that if senior US authorities decided to take this action, then a withdrawal would be possible, but the arrival of the two aircraft carriers in Qingdao was planned some time ago. The spokesman pointed out that the Navy Department had announced in September that the Tarawa and Valley Forge would leave San Diego on October 1 for "routine work in the Far East Pacific." He added that in addition to the two aircraft carriers, other warships are also on their way to join the aircraft carriers, cruisers, and destroyers in Qingdao. He stressed that this transfer is also of a routine nature and is not an emergency measure ordered because of the recent retreat of Chinese National Army troops in the Northeast and North China.

### If the Communist Bandits Control the Nine Provinces of the Northeast, World War Will Begin From This Point; The President Answers Three Questions From American Reporters

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 31st] New York Herald Tribune reporter A. Steele met with President Chiang on the 29th in Beiping and asked questions about the current situation, requesting the President to answer them. The President expressed his views on three questions:

(1) Regarding the question of "what are the basic reasons for the temporary setbacks of the National Army at present," the President replied as follows:

The government's consistent military policy, whether in the War of Resistance against Japan or the suppression of bandits, has been solely for the purpose of maintaining national territorial sovereignty and protecting the lives and property of the people. Therefore, not a single city or place can be easily abandoned. China fought the War of Resistance against Japan for eight years, with the recovery of the Northeast as its goal. After the end of the War of Resistance against Japan, the National Army risked danger to take over the Northeast, and its important areas could not be easily abandoned. The traditional thinking and sense of responsibility of the Chinese army are that coexistence with the land is the only duty of a soldier, and that leaving a city and abandoning defense is a shame to a soldier. Therefore, for three years, the National Army has set up defenses everywhere, and its strength has been divided, forming a situation of weakness everywhere. Taking advantage of this weakness, the Communist bandits used the tactic of "the big eating the small" to concentrate all their strength to attack one of our weak points, so they were repeatedly defeated one by one. This is why the current serious situation has gradually been created.

The government is a government of the people, and the recruitment of soldiers and the planning of food and supplies must take into account the interests of the people and abide by the laws of the country. The Communist bandits, on the other hand, have no love for the people, indiscriminately issuing counterfeit currency in various regions, confiscating the people's property at any time, conscripting young men, and plundering food, doing everything possible with their cruel means. In the past year, the Communist bandits have used the name of "land reform" to carry out a predatory exploitation, so the strength of the bandit army has expanded greatly for a time. The scorched earth policy of the bandit army when retreating and the "human wave tactics" when attacking are not what the National Army is willing to do. Therefore, when the National Army concentrates its strength to carry out a main battle, it must have a chance of winning. In a certain time and place, it often becomes inferior and suffers setbacks. This is the basic reason for the temporary setbacks of the National Army. Therefore, the government's strategic and tactical tactics for suppressing bandits today must be changed, and military, political, and educational policies should also be thoroughly reformed. We must take the overall situation into consideration in order to win the final success, and not contend for the gains and losses of a certain time and place.

I must also point out that the Communist bandits fighting against the government today are joint military actions of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean communist parties supported by the Communist International, and we should pay special attention to their seriousness. China has always been a weak country, but we have never been afraid of power and violence. We have already fought an eight-year war of resistance against the aggression of Japanese militarists, and we have fought a twenty-five-year struggle against Communist bandits with armed violence. Since the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the National Revolutionary Army has experienced many setbacks and suffered major failures in every long-term battle in the Northern Expedition, the suppression of bandits, and the War of Resistance against Japan, but in the end, it has always achieved glorious victories. In these twenty-five years, we have repeatedly encountered situations more serious than today, and we have always overcome them. Based on painful experience, we have firm confidence that as long as we make unremitting efforts with a spirit of perseverance, we firmly believe that suppressing the chaos and building the country will reach the final stage of success after this failure. It is hoped that the military and civilians across the country will thoroughly realize the rampantness of the Communist bandits and the crisis of the country, rise up together, share the national crisis, and fulfill their responsibilities to save the country and themselves. What we rely on is the national spirit and the Three Principles of the People, which can never be destroyed by any conspiracy or tyranny. We will never underestimate the seriousness of the bandit situation today, but every offensive launched by the Communist bandits due to the cruel exploitation of the people will exhaust their manpower and material resources, repeat the mistakes of the Jiangxi era, and will eventually be eliminated. If the government can obtain the moral and material assistance of friendly countries sooner and receive the support of international justice, final success can be achieved. It can be asserted.

(2) Regarding Steele's question of "whether the government is fully committed to maintaining Shenyang," the President replied as follows:

The government's determination to maintain the territory of the Northeast and the nation's sovereignty in the Northeast has been consistent since the September 18th Incident. If it is said that the entire situation in the Northeast has been militarily defeated since the fall of Jinzhou and Changchun, and the gains and losses of Shenyang are no longer as important as in the past, then the National Army's sacrifice of everything in Shenyang to fight the Communist bandits to the last is the greatest responsibility that our government can fulfill to the people and the world. The Northeast issue is one of the most important international issues, and it has a significant impact on the international situation, especially for countries closely related to the Pacific. For three years, this arduous common responsibility has been borne solely by China. After three years of arduous struggle, China has done its utmost, but it is a great regret that it has not been able to accomplish its mission. As early as seventeen years ago, when the September 18th Incident occurred, I issued a warning to friendly countries around the world and the League of Nations, believing that a world war would begin from this point. At that time, this warning was not valued by various countries, but historical facts proved that the Northeast issue was the prelude to the Second World War. Today, history is repeating itself. If international justice cannot be upheld and democratic countries still adopt an attitude of indifference, they will repeat the mistakes of the past. If the Communist bandits unfortunately control China, another world war will inevitably break out. Even if the Communist bandits control the nine provinces of the Northeast, world war will begin from this point. What is particularly clear is that without a complete Northeast, there will be no independent Korea, nor will there be a peaceful East Asia. I dare say that the dangerous storms in the Pacific will start in the Northeast again. (Continued on page 2)

A certain unit of the Aid-Jin Corps arrived at the Nanjidian area, Tangcheng Village, Qingshui River, and Qiliantun along both sides of the railway at 7:00 PM on the 30th and fought fiercely with the 19th Brigade of the bandits until dusk. The National Army successively occupied the east and west positions on the south bank, and the bandits abandoned more than 500 corpses and fled to the southeast.

### U.S. Military Aid to China to Be Shipped Early; High-Ranking Washington Officials Express Deep Concern Over China's Situation

[Central News Agency, Washington, 30th Dispatch] Well-informed sources recently stated that the first shipment of U.S. military aid to China, originally scheduled to depart in December, has now been moved up to November. The second shipment may be moved up to early December. However, they stated that this matter has not been finalized due to the possibility that a West Coast maritime strike could impede the transportation of materials. They said the supplies will be unloaded in Shanghai.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 30th Dispatch] The U.S. State Department declined to comment on reports in Time magazine regarding the progress of military aid to China. With regard to a public statement issued in early October in the form of a report submitted to Truman, State Department officials stated that no further reports will be forthcoming in the near future. Commentators believe that Senator Bridges, Chairman of the Foreign Aid Committee of Congress and Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, dispatched Mr. Bullitt to China at this time of tension, demonstrating Congress's determination to increase aid to China. Following Rep. Judd's statement that he believes aid to China should be increased, Congressional support for this has grown even more active.

[United Press, Washington, 30th Dispatch] High-ranking U.S. government officials here today expressed deep concern over the situation in China. At least several of them believe that the setbacks suffered by the Chinese government forces are mainly due to the inadequacy of the U.S. military aid program and the slow pace of shipping materials to China. Other officials, however, severely criticize the Chinese government. One official stated, "The U.S. has been so focused on dealing with affairs in Europe that we have allowed the communists to gain significant ground in the East." Another official stated that unless the U.S. provides more effective assistance with military equipment and advisors, the Nationalist Party will clearly be unable to launch a full-scale offensive against the communists. He continued, saying that President Chiang seems to have decided to shorten the defense lines and adopt a more tenable winter defensive position, so as to preserve strength until next spring. The retreat of government forces actually exacerbates the emergency situation in China and may have a significant impact on the willingness of the next Congress to provide aid to China. He further stated that there is now good reason to expect that President Chiang will reorganize the national army and, after increasing supplies and surviving the winter, will launch an offensive regardless of whether U.S. aid is increased or not.

Editorial

### Reflections on Reading the Supplementary Financial and Economic Reform Plan

The supplementary new measures for financial and economic reform were passed yesterday in the provisional administrative meeting. The main points are as follows: (1) Restore free trade in grain; (2) Continue to handle grain rationing in the six major cities; (3) The central government will set prices for cotton yarn, cloth, oil, sugar, coal, and salt based on cost accounting and coordinate adjustments. Local governments will set prices and manage other daily necessities and industrial raw materials based on cost accounting; (4) No localities are allowed to prohibit the flow of goods; (5) Public utilities will raise prices; (6) The salaries and wages of public officials and teachers will be adjusted; (7) Commodity taxes and other ad valorem taxes will also be adjusted according to prices. In summary: first, the salaries of public officials and teachers will be adjusted; second, taxes will be increased and public utilities and transportation will raise prices; and third, price controls will be abolished.

Among the above three resolutions, the first item, the issue of salaries for public officials and teachers, was immediately appealed for in this newspaper's editorial at the beginning of the August 19th financial and economic emergency decree. All parties have also pointed out that it is unreasonable and unsustainable. Because using 40 yuan as the base salary resulted in an excessive discount, and the ratio of gold yuan to silver dollars further halved the value in effect. Moreover, black market trading has been rampant for the past 70 days, and price controls have long been in name only. This time, the decision to allow reasonable increases in salaries and wages is undoubtedly a necessary result.

The relevant authorities have repeatedly announced that the second item, raising prices for state-run public utilities and transportation, had already been decided and was inevitable. Even without the drafting of this supplementary plan, it probably would not have been spared. As for raising tax rates, some of it has already been implemented, and now it is reaffirmed. It will certainly be carried out actively in order to make up for the deficit in the national treasury. However, we still hope that the degree of increase at this moment should not be too high, so as not to excessively stimulate prices and affect the value of the gold yuan.

What the public is most concerned about is, of course, the third item, the issue of price controls. In addition to allowing free trade in grain and other commodities, daily necessities such as cotton yarn, cloth, oil, sugar, coal, and salt, and important industrial raw materials, are all subject to cost-based pricing. This means abolishing price controls on the one hand and adopting negotiated pricing on the other. As things stand now, this can only be described as an effective remedy for the current crisis. Just imagine, daily necessities such as firewood, rice, vegetables, etc., all require lining up to buy, and even then, one cannot buy them. If we close our eyes and let this dangerous situation develop naturally, what can we expect for the future? However, there is one point that makes us wary, which is how to implement cost-based pricing. Because the four big characters "cost-based pricing" are easy to say, but not necessarily easy to do. How to do it just right, how to coordinate it comprehensively, its troubles and difficulties are similar to the previous 70 days of price controls. Moreover, it must be reminded that with price controls, materials become less and less; with negotiated prices, prices become higher and higher. At that time, everyone must not come to complain.

Judging from the literal meaning, the so-called cost-based pricing should be another name for negotiated pricing. According to past experience, the result of negotiated pricing is roughly one of two paths: one is that the government does not intervene much, allowing merchants to negotiate and raise prices themselves, which is actually equivalent to letting go; the other is that it is too tight, disregarding how much the cost is, insisting on forcing merchants to lose money, and having many concerns, unable to adjust in time, resulting in black markets, smuggling, and a lack of materials. Therefore, if the purpose of "cost-based pricing" is to eliminate exorbitant profits and maintain legitimate industry and commerce, the technical issue of how to implement it seems worthy of study. We believe that, whether it is at the central or local level, the relevant industry’s impartial people should first propose it themselves, with reasons attached, and report it for approval. When implementing the approval, it must be truly based on cost, publicly assessed, and in addition to the relevant parties being able to send representatives to state their opinions, it is best to have the people's representative body jointly handle it, in order to show fairness. The timeliness of the price negotiation should not be too rigid. Prices should rise and fall according to the actual market supply and demand situation, so as not to become a mere formality and lead to black markets.

In addition to cost-based pricing, the original proposal also contains the term "overall coordination" for cotton yarn, cloth, oil, sugar, coal, and salt under the central government's management, and local governments are also authorized to manage daily necessities and industrial raw materials. Thinking about it in terms of adjusting supply and demand and smoothing out sources, this is certainly reasonable. Moreover, during military operations, transportation is often obstructed, foreign exchange is limited, and there are often concerns about the continuity of raw materials. If the competent officials can help with allocation and find ways to assist, wouldn't that be a good thing? However, it is hoped that these coordination and management agencies will recognize their goals and not shirk responsibility or procrastinate, and especially not have any side effects, so as not to form disguised tax collection agencies, and thus not betray the central government's good intentions to maintain production and improve the economy. Judging from the past situation, it always feels that there is too much meaning of control, restriction, exploitation, and appropriation, and too little practical effect of supporting, encouraging, promoting, and maintaining. Except for factual necessities, it seems better to simply not care, just like price controls. For example, the national cotton joint purchase seems to be a way of "overall coordination" in the eyes of the textile industry, but may I ask what achievements have been made since its implementation? How much cotton has been snapped up? If cotton mills and merchants were encouraged to separately snap up cotton at that time, I am afraid their achievements would be far better than the current situation. The government has done many things wrong several times in the past, but it always refuses to believe it, stubbornly insists on saving face until it is too late to regret it. I sincerely hope that we will not repeat the same mistakes in the future.

Finally, as an aside, today's supplementary measures from the Executive Yuan were originally stipulated in Article 14 of the fourth measure in the August 19th emergency measures decree. The authorities should have been responsible for doing it well within a week or ten days after the decree was promulgated. At that time, black markets for various goods had not yet occurred, and the people's confidence in the gold yuan was strong. Dealing with it at that time would not have caused the market commotion of the past half month, and the common people would not have suffered the hardship of lining up to grab goods or lacking firewood and rice. And now, after taking such a big detour, it cannot but be done according to economic principles. This is truly what is called "being treated as an honored guest after being burnt and exhausted," while the original plan to divert the chimney and remove the firewood was considered alarmist. However, now that the government has decided on supplementary measures, the central authorities in the past, especially the senior officials who designed this "complete set of measures" in the financial authorities, should also have some sense of responsibility seeing the economic crisis of the past two months! Otherwise, even if policies change and society is in turmoil, the good officials will still do what they want. May I ask what the word "responsibility" in the constitutional term "responsible cabinet" means?

### To Resolve the Taiwan Coal Mine Dispute, Chen Qitian Decided on a Plan After Arriving in Taiwan; All Coal Mines in Taipei County Are to Be Privatized

[Our newspaper, Taipei, 31st dispatch] The Taiwan coal mine industry has been facing unresolved disputes over the opening up to private operation and the disputes between mine owners and contractors, resulting in serious obstacles to the increase in Taiwan's coal production.

Regarding the disputes between mine owners and contractors, three ways of solving the problem are prescribed: (1) Transfer of mining rights, (2) Leasing of equipment to transfer the mining rights to the mine owner, (3) Cooperative operation. The above methods all focus on making the mine owners and contractors get along well. If there are still objections, the government will enforce it compulsorily.

### President Answers Three Questions: A Front-Page Article

(3) Regarding the questions raised by Mr. Smith concerning "China's importance in the global anti-communist struggle, China's position in another world war, and the potential impact on the global situation should the communist party unfortunately control China," the President responded as follows:

China is striving to suppress communism to eliminate a powerful factor threatening world peace and to prevent the outbreak of a third world war. Therefore, I do not wish to express an opinion on China's potential position in a future world war. However, out of the world's 2.1 billion people, Asia accounts for over 50 percent, and China accounts for more than one-third of Asia's 1.1 billion people. The importance of Asia's position in the world, and China's position in Asia, is self-evident. I would like to point out the following: First, Asian nations, regardless of their political organization, economic life, social foundation, or cultural level, are less advanced than Western nations. Amidst widespread poverty and hunger, communist propaganda and organizational activities are more likely to be effective. Second, the Comintern's traditional strategy of world revolution and its current direction of expansion both target Asia as the primary objective, with China as the decisive point for Asia's future. The communist creed dictates that to control the world, one must first control Asia, and to control Asia, one must first control China. I can assert that if China is controlled by the communist party, a third world war will inevitably erupt, plunging humanity into another tragic disaster. If the Chinese government can eliminate the communist bandits of today, the factors for the next war existing in Asia will be eliminated, and the possibility of a third world war breaking out will also be reduced. The Chinese communist bandits possess armed forces, and their brutality and cunning are unmatched by communist elements in any democratic nation. However, the Chinese government has never abandoned its responsibility to the world and its allies due to the difficulties and damages it has encountered. Regardless of changes in the international environment, China has consistently adhered to international integrity and fulfilled its moral obligations, as it did in the past war against aggression and as it does in today's anti-communist struggle.

I firmly believe that the global anti-communist struggle must maintain a unified front. Western Europe and East Asia are equally important. However, Western European countries have advanced industries and higher cultural levels. Nationalism and democratic politics have a history of over 150 years, deeply rooted in the lives and thoughts of the people. Their reliance on American material and moral aid to resist communism is far less urgent than that of Asian nations. If the American people and their politicians truly seek the happiness of mankind, they should start with the world's largest region and the most numerous and suffering people, raising their living and cultural standards and assisting them in achieving independence and freedom. Today, to save the world's people from the disaster of a third world war, it is particularly necessary to save Asia, and the effort to save Asia should focus on China. This is truly an unprecedented and great undertaking in human history, and I hope that the American people and their politicians will take it as their responsibility. (End)

### Entire Galilee Region Under Jewish Army Control; Arab-Jewish Ceasefire Obeyed Yesterday; Security Council Subcommittee Revises and Passes Sino-British Proposal; US-UK Policy on Holy Land Awaits Adjustment

[Agence France-Presse, Haifa, 31st] The Israeli government notified the truce committee here that the Israeli government has ordered the Israeli army on the northern front to implement a ceasefire at 8:00 AM this morning. The head of the United Nations observer corps here requested that the Lebanese government also take the same measures. According to news from the northern front observers, Lebanon had ordered a ceasefire at 4:00 PM on the 30th, but subsequently reopened fire in self-defense.

[Associated Press, Tel Aviv, 31st] Israel announced on the 31st that the Jewish army's lightning offensive in northern Palestine had seized control of the entire Galilee region before the ceasefire deadline expired at 11:00 AM on the 31st. The war lasted only 48 hours, and the Arab irregular forces under Kaukji had already abandoned central Galilee. It is said that white flags can be seen flying everywhere in the area.

[Associated Press, Tel Aviv, 30th] On the 30th, the Israeli army launched a joint land and air offensive in northern Palestine, occupying the Arab stronghold of Tayshira (20 miles northeast of Haifa) and continuing to press forward, disregarding the United Nations ceasefire order. Most of the United Nations truce observers have withdrawn to Tiberias, a few miles south of the front line.

[Associated Press, Paris, 30th] The Security Council Subcommittee passed the Sino-British proposal on the Holy Land today. The Ukrainian representative opposed the proposal, and France also attempted to remove the part of the proposal concerning possible economic and diplomatic sanctions, but the other three countries supported it to the end. The Sino-British proposal was finally passed.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] The Palestinian issue cannot be resolved in the near future because the Security Council is currently taking delaying measures to wait for a clear indication of the trend of the American political situation and for the United Kingdom and the United States to adjust their positions on this matter. Currently, this matter is only being handled by the special subcommittee of the Security Council. After arduous work, the subcommittee has rejected and adopted several proposals and amendments several times and has agreed on a tentative proposal that stipulates: (1) The armies of Egypt and Israel in the Negev region will withdraw to the temporary defense lines drawn by the mediator; (2) Negotiations will continue to begin to delineate precise defense lines; (3) A seven-member committee will be organized to consider whether to take a sanctions plan in accordance with Article 41 of the United Nations Charter for those who disregard the orders of the Security Council. After this proposal is sorted out, it will be submitted to the Security Council for approval. At the same time, according to opinions in the United Nations lounge here, the American delegation will suggest postponing the Palestinian issue until the United Nations General Assembly convenes in New York in February or March next year for a final resolution.

### United Nations Work Stalls Before Election of New US President; If Dewey Is Elected, US Foreign Policy Will Not Change

[Associated Press, Paris, 30th] Before the United States holds its election on November 2, the United Nations, where work has stalled, believes on the 30th that if Dewey is elected, there will be little fundamental change in American foreign policy. Representatives are inattentive while debating minor issues in the United Nations and are waiting. It is almost impossible for the work of the United Nations to proceed before the United States elects a president. In fact, the representatives of the United Nations are deeply convinced of the reports that Dewey has an advantage over Truman in the presidential election.

However, it is also the first time in American history that a change of president is expected to have little change in foreign policy. According to officials from a Western country, "What we care about is not how American foreign policy will be after January 1 next year, but how American foreign policy will be between November 2 and January once the government changes." In order to dispel doubts about the situation of the American delegation after Dewey is elected, many diplomats here hope that Dewey will issue a statement after the election to clarify Dewey's attitude towards the tasks assigned to the American delegation.

### US Election Situation Broadcast to the Far East; 4,000 Voting Machines to Be Set Up Across the US

The broadcast to the Far East will begin at 10:15 AM (China coast time) on November 3 and will continue until 3:00 PM. After a two-hour break, the regular "Voice of America" broadcast to the Far East will resume at 5:00 PM, maintaining coverage of election news.

[Central News Agency, Chicago, 29th, Associated Press] In the upcoming election in the United States, approximately 4,000 voting machines will be set up across the country. It is reported that under the accelerated work of voting machine manufacturers, there are currently 4,500 such machines available for use.

### South Korea and North Korea Establish Diplomatic Relations

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 30th] The Yugoslav government formally announced today that it has accepted the proposal of the People's Republic of North Korea to establish diplomatic relations and seek to negotiate commercial relations between the two sides. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Kardelj has sent a telegram to North Korean Foreign Minister Pak Hon-yong conveying the South Korean government's decision.

### International Technical Cooperation Should Not Be Excluded

Britain and the United States Support Argentina's Proposal

[Associated Press, Paris, 30th] On the 30th, the United Kingdom and the United States adopted a position that Spain should not be excluded from international cooperation that is "purely technical," such as the economic statistics organization controlled by the United Nations. They argued in the United Nations Legal Committee that the principles of the United Nations' 1946 resolution to boycott Spain should not be applied to technical matters. They supported Argentina's proposal to allow Spain to join the International Economic Statistics Organization. The work of this organization was originally undertaken by the League of Nations and has now been transferred to the United Nations. The Soviet Union and its satellite states, France, and some Latin American countries opposed this proposal, pointing out that this proposal violated the United Nations resolution requiring member states to withdraw their ambassadors to Spain, which also excluded Spain from specific institutions.

### Political Turmoil in Greece; Prime Minister Sophoulis Prepares to Resign; Foreign Minister Tsaldaris May Be Ordered to Form a Cabinet

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 31st] A political crisis is expected to occur soon in Greece. According to sources from the Liberal Party, Prime Minister Sophoulis will resign after failing to obtain the confidence of a majority of members of parliament when parliament convenes. The person who succeeds in forming a cabinet may still be Sophoulis, but he must make a large number of changes to the cabinet's personnel. According to sources from the People's Party, Greek Foreign Minister Tsaldaris is expected to return to Athens today and may be ordered to form a cabinet because the People's Party is the party that occupies the most seats in parliament.

[Associated Press, Athens, 31st] The Greek political turmoil was caused by Liberal Party leader Venizelos's announcement that the United Nations' recommendations to Greece were unsatisfactory, making cooperation with the People's Party useless. Venizelos has divided the Liberal Party, so Sophoulis is expected to form a coalition government with the opposition in response.

### It May Be Difficult to Resolve the Greek Issue in the United Nations General Assembly for the Time Being

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] The United Nations Political Committee is currently discussing the Greek issue. Although the majority of committee members advocate voting on the proposals put forward by China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, which advocate expanding the powers of the Balkan Investigation Committee and asking Greece's northern neighbors not to interfere in its internal affairs, it may still be difficult to resolve the issue for the time being. It is reported that the Soviet bloc has put forward a counter-proposal, advocating that Greece and its neighbors restore diplomatic relations and withdraw American troops stationed in Greece.

### Japanese Diet Will Not Dissolve Until Civil Service Bill Is Passed; Yoshida Argues in Cadre Meeting

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 31st] Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida convened the Cabinet Secretary-General and senior cadres of the party again on the evening of the 30th to discuss the issue of whether to dissolve the Diet immediately. Yoshida still insisted that after the Diet passes important bills such as the revised Civil Service Bill, he would decide whether to dissolve based on the situation. When the Liberal Party was in opposition, it had requested the Ashida Cabinet to convene an extraordinary Diet session for these bills. At this time, it would be theoretically contradictory for the Liberal Party to be in power and dissolve the Diet without waiting for this bill to be passed. As for the situation in the Diet's discussion of various bills, although it is currently impossible to have a firm grasp of victory, even if an unfavorable situation occurs and it becomes necessary to dissolve the Diet, it is also what the Liberal Party had expected when it was in opposition. The result was unanimous support for Yoshida's opinion.

### East Germany Forms Police Army; Soviet Plan Obstructed

Germans Flee to Western Occupation Zones

[Associated Press, Berlin, 31st] A senior official of the US military government said that the Soviet Union had planned to establish a military "People's Police Army" in East Germany, but the plan was severely delayed due to the mass desertion of recruits. It was also said that the Soviet Union had wanted to establish an East German state, but the number of police officers fleeing to the West was increasing, and the German leaders appointed by the Soviet Union were also becoming increasingly wary of the Soviet side, so the establishment of the new country may also be shelved.

[Associated Press, London, 31st] TASS News Agency, Berlin, reports that the Soviet Union has recently recruited 10,000 more policemen in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, but firmly denies the British and American reports that the Soviet Union's actual strength is between one and one hundred and thirty thousand people.

### Seven-Nation Anti-Communist Alliance Treaty Being Drafted; Considering Expanding the Scope; Will Be Rapidly Unveiled After US Election

[Associated Press, Washington, 30th] Western diplomatic sources say that when seven Western nations plan to conclude the North Atlantic Mutual Defense Treaty, they intend to expand the scope of the alliance to cope with any acts of aggression in any corner of the world that affect their security. People involved in drafting the military alliance treaty say that the alliance will include situations in which the homelands, territories, and borders of the seven nations around the world are attacked. In addition, according to current plans, the treaty will stipulate that if world peace is threatened, the seven nations should act together to deter aggression. Detailed plans for this peacetime anti-communist alliance will be rapidly unveiled after the US Department of Defense and the State Department consult with the next president. The preliminary work on this plan has in fact been suspended, pending the president's review and decision on the procedures for the United States to participate in cooperation. US officials predict that the United States will participate in the North Atlantic Treaty as a contracting party and will provide Western European Allied nations with supplementary weapons until their own strength is sufficient to resist aggression from any direction. Authoritative sources say that the current plan includes the following broad points: (1) If any of the seven countries and the non-communist countries that subsequently join are subject to armed aggression, each country should consider it an aggression against all contracting parties, and each country should immediately decide on the steps to be taken and consult to determine collective action. (2) The areas protected by the mutual defense alliance should be specified in detail with latitude and longitude. (3) If the territories of the major contracting powers outside the above-mentioned areas are attacked, the Standing Defense Bureau should immediately discuss it. If sovereignty and political independence are threatened, the Standing Defense Organization should consider the steps that each country should take immediately. Officials hope that the alliance will include Portugal, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and other Western European countries.

### Special Household Registration: Investigation and Issuance of Certificates Procedures

As the city's general household registration check is imminent, the procedures for investigating and issuing certificates for special household registrations, such as military personnel and waterborne residents, have been jointly discussed and decided by the responsible persons of the Civil Affairs Bureau, the Garrison Headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Ninth Regiment of the Military Police, and the Police Bureau: (1) Special household registration investigation teams will be established according to the types of special household registrations, each team consisting of one member from the military, police, military police, and security forces, as a general principle. (2) To ensure accuracy, except for waterborne households, all military agencies, resident troop officers, hotel guests who have not been photographed and received certificates, or vagrant populations on the streets, will be subject to pre-investigation three days before the investigation by personnel specially assigned by the special household registration investigation team, issuing blank new National Identification Cards, which will be filled, stamped, and issued on the investigation day. (3) The method of issuing certificates to officers and soldiers of resident troops is as follows: In accordance with the resolution of the household registration investigation meeting convened by the mayor on October 26, identity cards will not be issued to officers and soldiers of resident troops; their ration purchase certificates will be reported to higher authorities separately for instructions; certificates will be issued to officers, but if any officers or soldiers have dependents living separately in Taishi, certificates will be issued in accordance with general ordinary household registrations. The division between military agencies and resident troops will be investigated and listed by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, including the names and addresses of each unit and the number of officers and soldiers, and submitted to the meeting before November 3.

Regarding the issuance of new National Identification Cards to hotel guests, the Hotel Industry Association has strongly opposed it, fearing that once guests obtain identity cards, they can use them to prove their right to reside there permanently. After discussion by the Civil Affairs Bureau and relevant parties, two methods have been decided: (1) Certificates will be issued to those who have applied for household registration before September 31 and are still residing in hotels; others will not be issued. (2) Guests who have resided in the city's hotels for a long time must not use the identity cards obtained by reporting their household registration as a basis for obtaining housing lease rights. In addition to submitting a request to the Municipal Council for public announcement, the court will also be asked to investigate.

### Tragedy in Front of a Butcher Shop at the Intersection of Yong'an Street, Nanshi; Woman Shot and Killed While Buying Pork; Squad Leader of the Kanjian Team Causes Trouble, to be Handled; Bereaved Family Makes Three Requests; Two Supervising Team Leaders Punished

[This newspaper news] At about 10:30 am yesterday, a tragic incident occurred in front of the Lugaoxian butcher shop at the intersection of Yong'an Street (Catholic Church Road), Sichuan South Road, where a woman was shot and killed due to the crowd buying pork. The murderer was Gu Hanming, the squad leader of the Kanjian Brigade. He was transferred to the brigade headquarters by the Huangpu Police Branch for investigation by the Garrison Command. It is reported that Zhu Li (39 years old), who lived in a pavilion room at No. 54 Dechang Lane, Jinling East Road, brought her daughter Zhu Xuelian (18 years old) to line up in front of Lugaoxian in the early morning to buy meat. Because Zhu Xuelian was interfered with by Gu Hanming, the two sides had a conflict, which angered Gu, who raised his gun and fired. Zhu's mother stepped forward to rescue her from the queue and fell to the ground in response. The bullet entered from the left breast in front of the chest and exited from the back. She died before she could be rescued. Order was disrupted for a time. Afterwards, the Huangpu Branch reported the incident and sent personnel to the bureau to bring Gu Hanming for interrogation. Gu admitted to the shooting but did not intend to shoot her. Later, Gu was transferred to the brigade headquarters and then to the Garrison Command for verification. It is reported that the deceased had five children, the youngest of whom was only a few months old, and the family was in great distress.

[Another News] After Zhu Li was shot and killed, the deceased's husband, Zhu Qingyun, made three requests to the Kanjian Brigade: (1) Punish Gu Hanming, (2) Assist the bereaved family in handling the aftermath, (3) Subsidize the education expenses of the children. Deputy Brigade Commander Chen Zhijing gave a satisfactory reply. Brigade Commander Wang Sheng expressed his regret that the squad leader Gu Hanming injured someone with a gun while on duty.

In addition, Supervisor Jiang Jingguo had just flown back to Shanghai and immediately heard the news. He immediately telegraphed Brigade Commander Wang and instructed him to send someone to represent him in comforting the family of the deceased.

### Zhejiang Gentleman Chen Huayu Passes Away; Funeral to be Held Tomorrow

Chen Weiyu, a veteran gentleman from Pinghu, Zhejiang, passed away at his residence in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 30th of last month at the age of 82. The funeral will be held at the Chinese Funeral Home on Huashan Road at 2 pm tomorrow. According to his will, no obituary will be issued and no mourning hall will be set up. He was a famous staff member of the late Qing Dynasty and was repeatedly invited by the Northern Warlords government with great respect. Later, he served as a magistrate in Fujian Province and was known for his strong orders. He rose to the position of prefect with outstanding reputation. After the Republic of China, the financial authorities again relied on him and repeatedly served as the director of the salt, tobacco, and alcohol tax bureaus in Jiangxi and Anhui provinces. Later, he was transferred to Jiangxi Province to deal with anti-smuggling affairs. Because he could not eliminate long-standing malpractices, he resigned in anger (in 1924). Since then, he closed his doors and swept the streets. Although he sometimes made a living by selling paintings and pawning clothes, he still strictly implemented the Yan family precepts and supervised his children. Therefore, his son Ju Lai, Tong Zhao, and Zuo Gaodeng, etc., were accustomed to tasting porridge, encouraging each other with integrity, and relying on printing and art galleries to provide for their parents in recent years. The integrity of the Chen brothers is said to be based on the old man's legacy, and everyone deeply feels the decline of the old gentry. It can be imagined that on the day of the funeral, plain cars and white horses will be extremely grand for a time.

### Dispersing Refugees to Jiangxi for Reclamation; Yuan Wenzhang Returns After Survey; First Batch of Over 3,000 People Sent

[This newspaper news] Yuan Wenzhang, the chief secretary of the Shanghai Relief Committee and the fourth section chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, went to Jiangxi to discuss everything related to dispersing refugees from the city to Jiangxi for reclamation, and returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. The first batch of migrants in this city will be 3,500 people, requiring 2 million yuan. Once the funds are available, registration and repatriation will be carried out.

Director Yuan went to Nanchang on this trip to meet with the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, and went to Zhanggongdu, Yongxiu, to conduct an on-site survey of the established reclamation sites. According to the survey: Jiangxi Province currently has a total of 614,400 mu of arable wasteland. Calculating at 20 mu per household, the counties in the province can accommodate about 30,000 reclamation households. If reclamation is to be carried out by the province, it is best to choose a site to establish a reclamation site. However, because Jiangxi Province has no funds for administrative and business expenses related to reclamation, it can only arrange resettlement in the 28 reclamation sites originally established in De'an, Yongxiu, Anfu, Jishui, Taihe, Wan'an, Le'an, Chongren, Nanyan, Guangchang, Lichuan, Zixi, Dexing and other counties, estimating that it can accommodate 1,100 reclamation households, about 3,500 people. Most of the reclamation sites in Yongxiu and other places were established during the Xingzong period. Among them, Zhanggongdu currently has 92 reclamation households with a total of 154 people, most of whom are refugees from Henan. Each household is currently allocated more than 10 mu for seasonal planting, and they also raise pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks. There is a primary school in the town where the children of the reclamation households can go to school. When Director Yuan went to conduct the survey, it was the harvest season. Each household had more than 10 dan of rice in storage, and they were self-sufficient and lived a stable life.

The first batch of 3,500 people planned to be resettled in this city included the allocation of ten months of rations, the construction of a thatched cottage for each household, one ox and one set of large farm tools for every three households, and one set of small farm tools and essential furniture for each household, totaling 180,000 gold yuan when the resettlement budget was prepared in July. Today, it requires 2 million yuan.

### More Than Half of the October Rice Ration Has Been Distributed; More Than 210,000 Shi Still Awaiting Purchase, Storage, and Shipment to Shanghai

In recent days, due to the difficulty for citizens to purchase rice, the reporter especially visited the Civil Affairs Committee yesterday to inquire about the reasons. According to Jun Yiyi, a member of the news team: the current source of grain is supplied by the Grain Department's Purchase and Storage Committee, but due to transportation difficulties and the urgent needs of citizens, all the rice that is transported to the committee is immediately transported to rice stores for distribution without entering the warehouse. The total amount of rice distributed in Shanghai each month is 527,788 shi. From October 16 to the end of October, the committee has done its best to distribute 312,506 shi in 15 days, including 97,706 shi allocated by the Purchase and Storage Committee, 1,080 shi from the Tianliang Department, 128,270 shi of whole and broken rice from the committee's inventory from the previous month, and 6,974 shi of rice that the committee raised and stored in warehouses.

### The Mystery of Coins: Silver Coins and Copper Coins Each Have More Than a Thousand Varieties; Both Have Historical and Cultural Value; Only a Few People in China are Known for Studying and Collecting Them

[Special Feature] The collection and research of coins is not as common in China as the hobby of stamp collecting, but coin collecting and stamp collecting both have historical and cultural value. Coin displays can be found in museums in various countries around the world, with extremely rich collections. Taking the United States as an example, it is said that there are more than 100,000 coin enthusiasts and collectors, and major cities have coin society organizations, while there are only four or five relatively well-known coin collectors in China.

Among Chinese coins, in addition to banknotes, the hard coins that have collection value are only two major types: silver and copper. Silver coins are divided into Yuan head, Sun head, Ship Ocean, and Dragon Ocean, while copper coins are divided into Guangxu Yuanbao, Daqing Copper Coin, and Double Flag Copper Yuan. In the eyes of ordinary people, all hard coins do not go beyond these categories, what is so precious to talk about? But in the eyes of collectors, there are more than a thousand kinds of treasures. Whether silver coins or copper coins, either the manufacturing region is different, or only a few exist, or the patterns are different, or there are errors in the printing plate, or they have commemorative value, as long as there is a slight difference, they are all the targets of their hunt and regarded as valuable treasures. Even many types of differences are only a slight difference in the micro-fine patterns, which can only be seen with a microscope. Therefore, in the words of collectors, there are at least more than a thousand kinds of silver coins and copper coins.

The Earliest Silver Dollar Was Cast in Guangdong

Yesterday, the reporter visited Zhang Huang, a coin researcher and collector in Shanghai, and saw many rare treasures from him.

The earliest silver dollar in China was officially cast in Guangdong in the thirteenth year of Guangxu. At that time, the weight was seven qian and three fen per coin, with the purpose of resisting the Mexican silver coin of seven qian and two fen. Unexpectedly, it was not long before it was specialized in melting it for sale as pure silver because of its heavier silver content for profit. After that, the seven qian and two fen coin was recast, and there were also changes in the pattern. Initially, the inner circle on the front was Guangxu Yuanbao, and the outer circle was written in foreign languages such as "Guangdong Province Made Seven Qian Three Fen", and the reverse was a dragon and Chinese characters such as "Guangdong Province Made, Seven Qian Three Fen". After this silver dollar was made, the Qing court was very unhappy because the pattern on the front was no different from symbolizing that Emperor Guangxu was surrounded by foreigners. Therefore, an order was issued to recast it, moving the foreign languages to the reverse and moving the Chinese characters on the reverse to the outer circle of the front, which is the form that has been circulating since then. The original style is called the reverse version, which is now very rare.

One Coin is Worth More Than 1,000 Gold Yuan

When Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, he made the Hongxian Flying Dragon Coin. The front was a portrait of Yuan Shikai, and the reverse was a winged dragon and the words "Chinese Empire, Hongxian Era". It is extremely rare and special, but this treasure is not as famous as the Longyang made in Hubei Province, because the words "Ben Sheng" (this province) are listed next to the dragon on the back of the Longyang, which is a rare product among millions. At that time, it was said to be worth more than 1,000 gold yuan, which is truly incomprehensible to those outside the circle.

Yuan head and Sun head coins should be extremely common, but not entirely. For example, there is a Sun coin with the English BIRTH on the back mistaken for RIBIH, and there are the two characters Gansu next to a Yuan head, which has become a treasure again.

The Nine-Star Flag Ten Wen is the Most Valuable Copper Coin

The most valuable copper coin is the Nine-Star Flag Ten Wen made in Anhui Province, followed by the Jiangxi Xinhai Dahan Ten Wen and the Guangxi Guangxu Yuanbao Ten Wen. Before the war, in 1935, Ji Jun once bought a Jiangxi Xinhai Dahan Ten Wen for 1,200 yuan, which shows the rarity of the rest. The most novel style is the Harbin One Fen coin, the pattern of which is a warship, meaning to build the navy. Only two of these have been seen to date. The face value of ordinary copper yuan should be ten wen and twenty wen. The largest face value is the Henan Double Flag, when five hundred wen, and the special face value is the Sichuan Dang Thirty Copper Yuan. When Hongxian proclaimed himself emperor, he also started to make copper coins. Before proclaiming himself emperor, the Wuchang Mint had already trial-produced two types of Yuan coin ten wen copper coins, which were not circulated. Especially one with a large face has less than ten pieces handed down to the world. Other portrait copper coins include Sun Yat-sen, Xu Shichang, and Tang Jiyao, all of which are extremely rare. When Zhu Zheyuan was in power in North China in 1936, he trial-produced 20 types of Pingjin copper yuan. Currently, only Ma Dingxiang has a complete set in China, which he cherishes very much.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the copper yuan that was looted by the Japanese was very large in number. Recently, they have been returned one after another. Among them, there may be many great treasures. Since the implementation of the new currency system, the Central Bank has exchanged more than 6 million silver coins. There must be extremely valuable products in such a large number. It would be a great pity if they were all melted and remade into new coins. Collectors hope that the government can appoint experts to select the treasures among them and send them to museums throughout the country for display. This will preserve historical relics for the country, and the people will have the opportunity to appreciate and study them.

### Collectors Hope that Ancient Coins Should Be Preserved

The matter that coin collectors have been worried about recently is that since the reform of the currency system, the government has not issued a clear order allowing the possession of rare ancient coins. If they are also required to be exchanged like ordinary gold and silver, then the loss of antiques is extremely regrettable. If they are still held, they are afraid of violating the law. Therefore, the Chinese Numismatic Society has submitted a letter to the Ministry of Finance, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Central Bank, requesting that it be clearly allowed to continue holding them. They believe that the scarcity of coins and whether they have collection value can be identified by experts and coin books for reference, so that people will not use the name of collectors as an excuse to hoard for profit. However, the government has not yet expressed any opinion on this request, it is said.

### General Commodity Prices: Price-Controlled Transactions Cannot Proceed, Barter Emerges in Response

Last week, the central authorities held several important meetings to review the current economic problems, with whether or not to continue maintaining price controls being the focus of the debate. Under this atmosphere in the market, and because the end of October was approaching, rumors spread that price controls would be adjusted starting in November. Generally, people, whether buying or selling, further increased their wait-and-see attitude, and transactions complying with the "August 19th" price controls almost disappeared.

Conversely, in the black market, rumors of surging prices were rampant. It is said that some items have exceeded the original price by more than ten times. Credit is tight, and black market interest rates are high. Due to the activities of various black markets, nearly 500 million yuan of floating capital has been drawn into this vortex. Purchasing even small items is extremely difficult. Taking a simple family as an example, items such as rice, oil, and sugar all require queuing to purchase, and the quantities are extremely limited. People have to wait for several hours, and those who are late risk going home empty-handed. Whether the price control policy is correct has not yet been definitively concluded, but judging from the current situation, it has indeed caused great inconvenience to the lives of most people, and it is necessary to quickly seek improvements based on the facts.

Given the aforementioned situation, as price-controlled transactions cannot proceed, barter has emerged in response and is popular for a time. The most significant examples are listed below:

(1) Yang Chuo'an, director of the Food Emergency Purchase and Storage Committee of the Ministry of Food, stated that after discussing with relevant central agencies the problem of allocating food supplies to the six major cities in November, the planning of allocating food supplies is now facing two difficulties due to price controls. One is that materials cannot be exchanged between rural and urban areas, causing prices in production areas to be higher than market prices. The second is that various production areas prohibit food from leaving their boundaries. After consultations with various parties, the above difficulties can be said to have been resolved. In response to the first difficulty, the Emergency Purchase and Storage Committee decided to exchange yarn and cloth for food. The Central Bank has allocated 6,000 pieces of cotton yarn and 60,000 bolts of cotton cloth, which have been inspected and received by the Emergency Committee. This batch of yarn and cloth will be used to exchange for 30-40% of the allocated grain for November, which is expected to yield 500,000 *shi* (a unit of dry measure) of rice and 500,000 *shi* of wheat.

(2) The National Cotton United Purchasing Committee decided: (1) To use one piece of 20-count cotton yarn as the standard to exchange for the cotton needed for two pieces of 20-count cotton yarn, with the shortfall paid in Gold Yuan Certificates. (2) To encourage cotton farmers and promote the smooth progress of purchasing work, if the amount paid in Gold Yuan Certificates exceeds the prescribed method, a certain amount of bonus will be issued depending on the circumstances. (3) The Central Bank has previously agreed to allocate 10,000 pieces of cotton yarn first, which can be picked up today and transported to cotton-producing areas to purchase domestic cotton. If the cotton yarn is insufficient in the future, the Central Bank can allocate the original total amount of cotton yarn and the portion of cotton yarn for domestic sales from the U.S. aid cotton yarn and cloth joint venture to exchange for cotton. (4) Cotton merchants in this city who have cotton can also exchange it according to the above exchange method and ratio.

(3) The Wuxi Materials Adjustment Committee decided that the first batch of 20,000 bags of flour that can be supplied to Shanghai will be shipped immediately. Wuxi needs Shanghai to supply the following materials: 12,000 *dan* (a unit of weight) of sugar, 3,500 boxes of soap, 25 million cigarettes, 400 boxes of matches, more than 3,000 pieces of cotton yarn, and 60,000 bolts of cotton cloth.

Since the promulgation of the Emergency Measures for Finance and Economy two months ago, leading to the extremely abnormal economic situation at present, the authorities have, after days of discussion, formulated a plan of relevant economic measures to remedy the situation. The plan was carried to Beiping by Li Weiguo, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, last Friday to be submitted to the President for approval. In addition, relevant agencies and concerned people are also making appeals regarding the current economic situation.

(1) The Economic Resources, Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Committee, the Finance and Food Committee, and the Interior and Land Administration Committee of the Control Yuan held a joint meeting on the 26th to review the current economic situation. The meeting listed facts such as currency inflation, production reduction, cargo pileup, loose credit, and high black market prices, and submitted a correction proposal to the Executive Yuan, urging it to quickly seek effective measures to stop this serious phenomenon.

(2) The Legislative Yuan held its 15th meeting on the 29th. Legislator Chen Mingxian proposed a temporary emergency motion: "Please propose methods to urgently rescue the current economic crisis, and request the government to implement them." The emergency measures proposed by Chen were: (1) Levy capital from wealthy families. (2) Levy materials stockpiled by large households. (3) Use the gold, silver, and foreign exchange collected by the Gold Yuan Certificates to purchase raw materials for daily necessities. (4) Purchase materials from areas occupied by the Communist bandits at high prices. (5) Implement full rationing, starting with major cities. (6) Ration raw materials to factories. (7) Provide large-scale agricultural loans. (8) Remove price controls on daily necessities. (9) Adjust prices of state-owned enterprises. (10) Pay public and educational personnel according to the price index.

(3) Zhu Guangji and 16 other professors from various universities in Beiping jointly drafted a lengthy "Plea for the People: Relieve Man-Made Suffering and Injustice," and asked President Hu Shi to forward it to the President and Premier Weng. The document pointed out that the reasons for rising prices are: "Although rising prices are mainly due to currency inflation, reduced production, lack of materials, reduced area of currency circulation, and the psychological impact of war and unrest can all similarly cause prices to rise." The demands to the government are: "(1) The success limit of the Gold Yuan Certificate is that the government can implement rationing of major necessities of life according to the August 19th price controls. (2) The government should increase taxes on public utilities to make reasonable price increases and raise funds to subsidize rationing expenses. (3) All other price controls should be lifted, and there is no need to negotiate prices. Maintain a free market so that economic activity does not stagnate and does not affect the basic lives of ordinary people."

### Monetary Finance: Tight Credit Shifts to High Black Market Interest Rates, Creating a New Record After Currency Reform

Last week, the tightness of credit in this city can be said to have reached a climax, which is very similar to the phenomenon of alternating loosening and tightening of credit in the era of legal tender. Although there are many reasons for this, in essence, it is nothing more than the inevitable result of malignant currency inflation. Looking forward and backward, one cannot help but feel a thousand emotions!

As last week approached the end of the month, the market's need for funds may have been more urgent than usual. As for the brewing new controlled economy plan, the general view is that it must be relaxed, so there were more people searching for funds, as if as long as they could borrow money and purchase some materials, it would always be cheaper in the not-too-distant future. Speaking of the suppliers of funds, of course, they have the same mentality, so the imbalance between supply and demand of funds caused the gradual rise of black market interest rates, which are comparable to market interest rates before the currency reform. From this, it is not difficult to predict that the financial situation, which has been quiet for more than two months, will return to an extremely serious stage.

Another main reason for the shift of credit to tightness is the large outflow and southward flow of floating capital. The inflow of floating capital into the countryside is indeed to seek a way out in the cracks of control. The large southward flow of floating capital can also preserve its value after being converted into Hong Kong dollars or other currencies. It is estimated that the total amount of capital flowing south in recent days has reached 5 million Gold Yuan, and some even say that it reaches about 2.5 million yuan per day. The southward flow of capital and the tightness of credit are actually a replay of the old tune before the "August 19th" currency reform.

Although there are no accurate figures to be found for the exchange difference of national banks last week, reports say that due to the handling of remittances to other places and the collection of payments for allocated sugar and cloth, there was a considerable surplus, which naturally fueled the wave of tightness. Foreign banks also had a considerable surplus over the week, which was generally related to the southward flow of capital.

One of the results of tight credit is high black market interest rates. On Monday of last week, the market interest rate had already exceeded 20%. By Wednesday, it had reached 30%. On Thursday and Friday, there were quite a few daily loans made at 15-16 yuan, which is equivalent to an interest rate of 45%, which has not been seen since the currency reform.

Commercial banks and stores are generally short of cash, so some of them are replenishing their cash from outside the industry, and borrowing between industries is becoming more prosperous. On Monday, banks limited cash withdrawals for customers to around 500 yuan. If the amount exceeded the limit, they would issue promissory notes, and the scene of promissory notes flooding the streets before the currency reform is now vividly remembered.

Last week, remittances to Taiwan and Guangdong were restricted, so many people used the method of transporting cash, and cash funds became unusually tight. Discounts on larger denominations of cash were seen repeatedly, reportedly between 0.4% and 0.8%. Cash shortages often occur at the same time as tight credit.

Although there was no major change in the exchange rate within the week, the black market exchange rate soared sharply, especially in Hankou and Chongqing. According to reports, each thousand yuan was around 50 yuan. The daily interest rate in Chongqing has reached 25 yuan, so funds were transferred back to Chongqing to be lent out. In Hankou, it was due to the relationship between the southward flow of funds to escape to Hong Kong, which created the highest black market exchange rate since the currency reform. The Bank of China has stopped handling large remittances to Hankou and Chongqing. Remittances of more than 3,000 yuan are subject to exchange, and the Bank of China has stopped all commercial remittances to Guangzhou except for private living expenses.

There was no change in the official price of foreign exchange last week. The price of Hong Kong gold per Chinese ounce was 303.5 yuan on Monday and rose to 306 yuan on Tuesday. The original price of Tuesday was maintained on Thursday. The market price of Hong Kong dollars dropped slightly, from HK$5.28 on Monday to HK$5.26 from Tuesday to Thursday.

— Lei Ting

— All moral doctrines, if incompatible with the system of social life, are powerless. — Kropotkin

Diligence and thrift have always been regarded as virtues, but their limits should vary according to different environments and times. If one must rigidly adhere to the old ways and follow the ancients step by step, then the so-called virtue expressed is only a proof of one's lack of progress, or at least the lack of progress in the art of living.

For example, "working at sunrise and resting at sunset" is the diligence of the ancients, but now we should at least have some considerable entertainment to adjust ourselves in addition to "working and resting"; "a basket of food and a gourd of drink" is the thrift of the ancients, but now we should pay more attention to nutritional intake in addition to using food as a tool to fill our stomachs. This is not excessive, it is necessary; it is not wasteful, it is correct. Because the current era and environment are different from those of the ancients, human beings should progress with the progress of the times, otherwise, they will be backward and ignore reality.

Saying this is not opposing diligence and thrift, let alone advocating laziness and extravagance. Rather, it is to say that diligence and thrift should have their appropriate limits. Otherwise, if one works 24 hours a day, diligence is indeed achieved, but what is the efficiency of the work? If one eats only coarse rice for three meals a day, thrift is indeed achieved, but what is the degree of nutrition?

As long as you think about the times, the national essence experts do not have to constantly sigh that today's people are not as good as the ancients.

Since the authorities advocated frugality, the response has been truly overwhelming. This shows that the people's hearts are not dead, and the country can be saved. Of course, in today's difficult times, all citizens have the need to cut back on clothing and food to help the military and work hard to increase production. However, what the authorities have shown us is to eliminate unnecessary waste, not to abolish legitimate needs. The provisions are there, and they can be carefully studied. However, some responders often overcorrect, making things difficult for others, which makes me suspect that they are only making verbal announcements.

Now let's give an example of overcorrection:

"Cheng ××, a celebrity in Guangzhou, initiated the construction of a frugal new village, stipulating that residents of the village: 1. Are not allowed to privately own cars; 2. Are not allowed to set up private kitchens; 3. Are not allowed to wear Western-style clothes and leather shoes." (See this newspaper on the 20th of this month)

Whether people with their own cars will join the village is another matter. Just from the car itself, it is very questionable whether it is necessarily extravagant. I think if you are not an idiot, you should understand the difference between taking a car to handle important matters and taking a car to dance or play cards. Is it true that people who take cars should not be thrifty, cannot be thrifty, or do not want to be thrifty? This is the first point.

"No private kitchens" is even more forcing different families to live their own ideal lives. In short, it is forcing people to do things that are difficult for them. May I ask: Since it is neither a group nor a troop, why must they eat "communal meals"? This is the second point.

Western-style clothes, which are also called "Hu clothes" by national essence experts, and leather shoes, I boldly inherit the teachings of the "masters" and tentatively name them "Yi abdomens," which I feel is more righteous and stern than the words "leather shoes." But what kind of clothes are long gowns and mandarin jackets? Today's shoes are also very different from those of the ancients. Why is the former necessarily extravagant, while the latter is in line with thrift? This is the third point.

Diligence and thrift must be practiced equally, which shows that there should be no distinction between self and others. However, it is necessary to make three chapters of the law, tighten the face, and do not blame the shallowness of me and others for being unpredictable.

This passage is not directed solely at Cheng in Guangzhou, and his enthusiasm is also worthy of admiration. Our main goal is to hope that the virtuous people who have the ability to issue calls should have a plan, and should come up with a practical plan; if you want to do work, you should come up with a feasible work. Do not ignore reality, entangle the wrong era, and look to the heavens and the earth to make lofty and unattainable grand theories. I am sincerely afraid and look forward to it.

The window captures Qingbo and a wide field of Yang, evening bells and morning birds emerge from the forest's edge, smiling slightly at this life, dropping one's arms and eagerly drawing ancient joy, the vast autumn graves with new ghost shadows, the floating and sinking worn-out official of old poems, my Xiang has never reached the heart and bones, teaching me to listen to the sound of the rice, my ears are always sour.

Returning home at night, hanging lamps leave traces, shaking hands is extraordinarily strange, the cart and umbrella are numerous, most of them have been separated for three or five years, it is difficult to pour out in one or two days; when is the time for those who can dust their hats, who will summon the souls who jump into the sea when the trees fall? Idly leaning on the west wind, supporting cold eyes, the withered lotus shakes the water, half the lake is turbid.

### Signing In and Duty Roster

— Lao Dan

Every organization, for personnel management and performance evaluation, must have a sign-in book. Employees are required to sign in every morning and afternoon when coming to work. There are two ways to sign in: one is to write the name with a pen, and the other is to stamp a personal seal. Some even require noting the time of arrival. Superficially, this seems like a thorough way to manage personnel attendance. Moreover, the sign-in books are usually collected fifteen minutes after the designated office hours. The supervisor then signs the book. If any unsigned spaces are found (because each employee's signature position is pre-determined), the supervisor draws a straight line down the space, indicating that the employee was absent that day. The personnel management department then checks whether the employee had applied for leave. If not, the absence is recorded as absenteeism. If the employee arrives late and fills in the signature, it is recorded as tardiness. There are strict regulations for both absenteeism and tardiness in terms of performance evaluation.

However, in reality, the sign-in system in organizations is often a mere formality and a show of deception. Some employees are exempted from signing in with the special permission of their superiors; others, with strong backing, do not sign in regardless of permission; some have colleagues sign for them, while others ask laborers to sign for them. (Stamping a seal is even easier to cheat.) Some sign in the afternoon in the morning, and some sign for tomorrow today. Supervisors and personnel departments (offices) never send anyone to oversee the signing process. Therefore, only about 20-30% of employees actually sign in themselves. The biggest reason is that employees in slightly higher positions do not come to work on time, so tardiness and early departure become common among junior employees. Due to overstaffing, many supervisors hold multiple positions, and the workload is not demanding. It is not like bank employees, where each person manages a specific task, and if it is not completed today, it accumulates for tomorrow, forcing them to handle it sequentially. This leads to the bad habit of tardiness and early departure. Some supervisors treat a few employees differently, knowing that someone is late or absent but failing to deal with it impartially. Instead, they give them promotions and pay raises during performance evaluations. Personnel managers also hesitate to challenge based on "personnel independence" due to the opinions and favor of their supervisors. Due to these complex reasons, the sign-in book becomes a mere formality, which is not surprising.

Nevertheless, every organization and every employee feels that the sign-in book is a symbol of pretense and deception, yet no one proposes to abolish it. This is the officialdom's way of "colluding in falsehood."

Equally meaningless as the sign-in book is the duty roster. The so-called duty roster (excluding military, police, and security agencies) requires employees to take turns on duty outside of the designated office hours, usually from 5:00 PM to 8:30 AM the next morning, and all day on holidays. The so-called duty means that major issues cannot be handled, and minor issues do not need to be handled. Even if there are some issues to be handled, they cannot be resolved because they are not familiar to the person on duty. At most, they can only temporarily receive and dispatch some letters and telegrams. It seems like overkill and a waste of resources (those on duty are usually paid duty allowance) to have several employees who are not from the receiving and dispatching group stay to handle letters and telegrams outside of office hours. Generally, those on duty simply write a few routine sentences in the duty log the next day, such as "Received and dispatched a few letters and telegrams, no other incidents occurred," and stamp it before handing over. In reality, they are not on duty but simply instruct the janitor on duty to take care of things. Therefore, the organization's duty roster is also like a false sign-in book. The government wastes duty allowances every day without achieving any real results. Some organizations have now abolished the duty roster and instead assigned one or two employees who live in the organization to be responsible for receiving external letters and telegrams after everyone else has left, with a modest monthly allowance. This is more reasonable, but unfortunately, only a few organizations have implemented this.

### Superstitions of the English

— Hong Xian

Before the 19th century, the English also had many superstitious beliefs, similar to those in China. Here are some excerpts from the data recorded in ten volumes of folklore:

(1) When entering someone else's threshold, step in with the right foot first.

(2) Accidentally spilling salt is bad luck, but throwing a little over the left shoulder can avert disaster.

(3) When washing hands in the same basin with others, draw a cross in the water.

(4) Do not walk under a ladder.

(5) Rubbing someone else's crutch on one's right foot can cure rheumatism.

(6) Hanging a front leg and a hind foot of a field mouse in a bag around the neck can prevent toothache.

(7) Hanging red beads around the neck can prevent nosebleeds.

(8) Carrying a piece of amethyst in the pocket will prevent drunkenness.

(9) When a child has whooping cough, pluck a strand of hair and put it in bread for a dog to eat, so that the cough can be transferred to the dog to suffer instead of the child.

(10) Touching the eyes with a gold wedding ring can cure styes.

(11) Hanging an old horseshoe at home can bring good luck to the family.

(12) Rocking an empty cradle is unlucky for the child.

### Silence

— Qian Dacheng

Confucius said, "I desire to be silent." Some say that he said this disheartenedly after traveling around various countries and encountering obstacles everywhere. I don't think that's necessarily the case. A gentleman's words must be consistent with his actions, and his actions must be consistent with his words. Confucius was definitely not like today's loudmouths who cannot deliver on their promises. Since he couldn't deliver, it was better to remain silent. The highest realm of any thinker does not emphasize speech. Lao Tzu already said, "Those who know do not speak." Zhuang Tzu also advocated "forgetting words when one understands the meaning." When Sakyamuni explained the Dharma and mentioned the ultimate meaning of life, he only said "Inconceivable, inconceivable, unspeakable, unspeakable." The highest degree of love between a man and a woman is definitely not shouting "Love! Love!" but "mutual heart-to-heart connection," which absolutely does not require words.

Furthermore, in the Water Margin, when Li Kui pretended to be a mute Taoist, he needed to put a coin in his mouth so he couldn't speak. When I was young, I laughed every time I saw this passage. Today, when I reopen the book and reread it, I no longer have the feeling of laughing easily. I only feel that Li Kui is everywhere, disguised as a mute Taoist! Alas – I desire to be silent. – However, I have finally said these words again. Will I ultimately become a verbose chatterbox?

In times of upheaval, many special terms naturally arise, which are both amusing and distressing to think about. For example, the word "powerful elite" has been widely publicized and familiar to everyone in the country in recent years, and is "condemned by thousands of people," yet there is no clear definition. Generally speaking, it seems to refer to "those who have special privileges and benefits and are beyond the reach of national laws and sanctions." This is how it differs from the "financial cliques" and "warlords" that were condemned in the past and forms a separate category. Therefore, punishing corruption is called "What about the powerful elite?" Investigating hoarding and price gouging is called "What about the powerful elite?" And the term "powerful elite" has become the target of public criticism. The word "powerful" was originally a complimentary term. Someone who can write ten thousand words as quickly as one who leans against a horse is said to have a "powerful writing style"; someone who can write a hundred poems after a斗of wine is said to have a "powerful poetic style"; someone with great talent, lofty aspirations, and a heroic spirit that surpasses the masses is said to be a "powerful person." The ancients said, "Sages, virtuous men, heroes, and outstanding figures," heroes and outstanding figures are only second to sages and virtuous men. Only "local bullies and evil gentry" are condemned by the world, but the problem lies in "local bullies and evil," not in "powerful gentry," just as "corrupt officials and wicked clerks" are hated for "corruption," not for being "officials and clerks." But today's so-called "powerful elite" refers to those who rely on power and profit to violate laws and regulations, which is a great misfortune for the word "powerful." Moreover, it is followed by "elite," which is like the elite of "the vermilion gates smell of wine and meat" and "entering the gate of a noble family is as deep as the sea," not the elite of "gates of propriety and paths of righteousness"!

Moreover, comparing "tiger hunting" with "fly swatting" is also seen in newspapers in the north and south, and the public has been clamoring for it for a long time. In fact, it is a variation of "when jackals are in power, who cares about foxes," which seems a bit newer and more lively, and can also serve as a footnote to "powerful elite." It is a pity that China lacks a scientific foundation. Despite the emergence of new terms and endless creations, the importance of first giving a clear definition has been ignored. In recent years, it is not that corruption has not been punished. When one is punished, the public cries out: "This is a small shrimp, not a tiger!" When another is punished, they also say: "This is a small tiger, not a big tiger!" When another is punished, they cry out again: "This is a fake tiger, not a real tiger!" To what extent is it a big tiger? What kind of person is a real tiger? There is no consensus. Therefore, there is only a feeling of injustice, but no actual effect of "rectifying the injustice."

Recently, Mr. He, a member of the Political Committee for the Disposal of Enemy and Puppet Property, who came from the south to Tianjin, invited people from all walks of life in Tianjin and delivered a long speech, stating that most of the enemy and puppet properties were forcibly occupied by powerful forces, and now he is determined to solve the problem thoroughly and forcibly move them out, with very clear language. He also said, "I would rather drive away the powerful elite than drive away the refugees. I will first deal with the upper-class people and then deal with the lower-class people." The terms "upper-class people" and "lower-class people" are also very new and ingenious. The term "lower-class people" existed in ancient times, such as the "precept stone" in county government offices, which read "It is easy to abuse the lower-class people, but it is difficult to deceive Heaven." Now, adding the term "upper-class people" to contrast with it is also another footnote to "powerful elite." As the saying goes, "One must endure all hardships to become an upper-class person." How should today's "upper-class people" be interpreted? It is very thought-provoking... Reply from the Water Company to a reader of this newspaper...

### Poor Water Supply on Dagu Road Due to Clogged Pipes and Small Diameter

— Reply from the Water Company to a reader of this newspaper

Received your letter of September 22 regarding the poor water supply in Lane 468 and 506 of Dagu Road. We have sent personnel to inspect the area and cut off a section of the water pipe for thorough examination. The reason for the poor water flow is that the water pipes in the area have been in use for too long, and the inside of the pipes is clogged with sediment from the water, causing the poor water flow. In addition, the diameter of the water pipes is also too small.

Our company is committed to serving the people and will do our best to improve the situation within our capabilities. Our company has an inspection and repair department specifically for this type of work. We hope that this explanation will be provided to your newspaper's readers so that they can understand the truth. In the future, if users encounter difficulties with the water supply, they can notify our company at any time so that we can send personnel to repair it quickly. Sincerely, Wei Bo, Deputy Chief Engineer. October 26, 1937.
