[Our Dispatch] William C. Bullitt, former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, arrived in Shanghai for another visit yesterday afternoon at 4:15 pm on a Pan American Airlines flight. Many people went to Longhua Airport to welcome him, including Bei Zuyi, who had just returned from the United States, Zhang Bide, representative of Mayor Wu, Liu Gongyun, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, Zhao Dihua, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, Chen Changtong, General Manager of the Foreign Department of the Bank of China, Conner of the U.S. Information Service, Wei Jingmeng of the Information Bureau, as well as the U.S. Consul General, the American Chamber of Commerce, and representatives of the Chinese financial community, totaling several dozen people. At the airport, Mr. Bullitt told reporters that his visit to China this time was purely a private one. Regarding rumors that he would be the implementer of the U.S. aid to China plan, Mr. Bullitt firmly denied it, saying that he had absolutely nothing to do with this matter, only saying: "I will stay in China for a month and return to the United States around the beginning of June. This time I plan to visit friends in China and want to learn about China's situation since I left China last September." When reporters asked him which aspect of the Chinese situation he wanted to know, economic, political, or military, Mr. Bullitt replied with a smile: "I am interested in any aspect of the Chinese situation, because I like China and love the Chinese people." Regarding Mr. Bullitt's visit areas in China, he has not yet decided. He is scheduled to go to Nanjing this morning on a U.S. military plane. After arriving in Nanjing, he will visit President Chiang Kai-shek and various friends, because he has many friends in Nanjing. The date of his stay in Nanjing has not been determined.

According to relevant sources, Mr. Bei will accompany Mr. Bullitt to Nanjing. Therefore, although Mr. Bullitt himself has repeatedly stated that it has nothing to do with aid to China, outside speculation still believes that Mr. Bullitt will be the person in charge of the aid to China plan, but because it has not yet reached the time to announce it, the official authorities have not confirmed it.

[Our Dispatch] Bei Zuyi arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning, his mission being to welcome William C. Bullitt, who came to China to discuss the use of U.S. aid materials. According to a senior official of the Central Bank, after Bei met with Bullitt, he accompanied Bullitt to Nanjing. In the future, Bei is likely to be the host of the U.S. aid agency in our country. This agency will take the form of a committee directly under the Executive Yuan. The ministers of the four departments of agriculture, economy, finance, and food, and relevant officials such as the governor of the Central Bank, will be appointed as members.

### Kuomintang National Assembly Delegates' Central Committee Conversation: President Chiang Attends and Instructs, encouraging the sacrifice of the small self to complete the great self.

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 3rd] The Kuomintang took advantage of the gathering of various comrades in Nanjing to attend the National Assembly and held a conversation meeting for National Assembly delegates on the 3rd at the National Assembly Hall to discuss politics, economics, and military affairs. The memorial week of the Premier was also held in the morning, presided over by Chiang in his capacity as Director-General. In addition to the Kuomintang National Assembly delegates, there were also members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees in Nanjing, totaling about two thousand people. The memorial week was held at 9:30 am. After the ceremony, the Director-General instructed, roughly divided into three parts: (1) a review of the performance of the party comrades in the National Assembly, (2) the direction in which the party comrades should work together after the completion of the National Assembly, and (3) points for the attention of the comrades. The instruction lasted about 40 minutes, ending at 10:20 am. After a 10-minute break, the conversation meeting was held. After Chairman Ju Zheng and Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng explained the procedure, the political review began. Today's focus was on the broad nature, so most opinions were expressed on principles. The meeting was adjourned at noon. The main points of Director-General Chiang's instructions are briefly recorded as follows: The Director-General first stated: "The National Assembly has achieved a satisfactory result this time, which is the greatest success of our party, and it can also be said that it has been achieved by the efforts of our party comrades in accordance with the teachings of the Premier. This point can indeed be reported to the spirit of the Premier in heaven. However, this conference can also be said to be one of the greatest lessons for our party comrades. Our performance, both good and bad, is visible." The Director-General then elaborated on the shortcomings and hoped that comrades could work hard to improve them. Secondly, the Director-General pointed out that the direction in which we should work after the completion of the National Assembly is in three parts. First, in politics, we should abide by the constitution and implement it in accordance with the spirit of the constitution, and show our spirit of the rule of law. This lies in the exercise of the principle of democracy. The second is to restore the territory of the Republic of China and ensure the territory of the Republic of China in order to complete the ideal of nationalism. The third is to promote land policy, implement equalization of land ownership, and control capital in order to achieve the implementation of the principle of people's livelihood. Finally, the Director-General's opinion is to emphasize the importance of "self-confidence, self-improvement, and self-reflection." It is necessary to sacrifice the small self to complete the great self, and then eliminating the Communist Party will be as easy as turning one's hand. The Director-General's instructions received enthusiastic applause several times. The Director-General's extremely calm attitude and sincere words moved the participants.

In the afternoon at 3:00 pm, the economic and military reviews continued. Chairman Li Wenfan asked the representatives to speak separately and raised questions about the current administration. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 pm. The chairman announced: "All inquiries and written opinions will be compiled by the secretariat and submitted to the Director-General, and distributed to various ministries and commissions for replies, and then printed and distributed to all comrades." The conversation meeting was scheduled to hold a party affairs review for one day on the 4th. Also, the comrades who spoke today were dissatisfied with the current government measures. The various opinions were similar to those expressed during the review of the current situation held before the National Assembly. At the same time, they put forward the "innovation" proposal, believing that the current politics, military, and economy must be improved, and their words were激昂.

Editorial

### Science, Democracy, and Reason – Written to Commemorate the "May Fourth" Movement

Today is May 4th, the anniversary of the patriotic movement launched by the student community in the eighth year of the Republic of China, which was joined by the national education and business communities, forcing the warlord government to dismiss Cao Rulin, Lu Zongyu, and Zhang Zongxiang. Time is like an electric wave. The youths who participated in the demonstrations in Beiping in those days are now mostly gray-haired, and this year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the May Fourth Movement.

The May Fourth Movement was indeed led by the student community and the enthusiastically supporting education community, but the response spread throughout all levels of society, and its influence extended to all aspects of politics, economics, and culture. Those of us who have lived in Shanghai for a long time can imagine the enthusiasm of the Shanghai business community in opposing the Twenty-One Demands and dismissing those who signed the treaty - this precisely represents the national and civil rights consciousness under the oppression of foreign aggression and the chaotic politics of warlords. Subsequently, the transformation of the business, academic, and social atmosphere was all broadly influenced by it. Therefore, the so-called May Fourth Movement should be considered a broad social and cultural movement, not just a youth movement in the narrow sense.

From the May Fourth Movement's opposition to Japanese aggression to the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, China has experienced much pain and hardship externally, but its national status is still strong externally and weak internally. From the May Fourth Movement's advocacy of social and political reform in China to the promulgation of the constitution and the election of a new president today, China's internal affairs have undergone many difficulties and detours, but the scale of constitutional governance is only just beginning to be laid. This is truly enough to evoke endless emotions and motivate us to learn from the past to understand the future and review our gains and losses.

The May Fourth Movement had the merit of liberating and promoting Chinese students and the Chinese social atmosphere, but it also had its negative influences. Over the past twenty years, there have been too many discussions about the merits and demerits of the May Fourth Movement, and there is no need for us to say more at this moment. We only cannot forget the two major signposts revealed in the May Fourth era: science and democracy. The so-called "Mr. Science" and "Mr. Democracy" were not only popular terms in society at the time but also the yardsticks for arguments in the public opinion circles and the ideals of all aspiring people. We recognize the May Fourth Movement as a national social and cultural movement, so we must look at how far these two weapons have evolved in China thirty years later, as well as our gains and losses in these two areas and the remedies we should make, to serve as the basis for our future efforts.

First, let's talk about science. When we browse newspapers and periodicals from around the eighth to tenth years of the Republic of China, we find articles advocating science everywhere. However, the substantive progress of science in China in these five or six years was far less than after the sixteenth year, while literary creation was a temporary darling. This symbolizes that the promotion of science at that time was only general discussions of science, superficial scientific methods, and a superficial scientific atmosphere, rather than scientific experiments, specialized scientific research, and a practical scientific spirit. What Qing Li saw in Western learning was the "strangeness of scientific instruments," what the May Fourth Movement yearned for was the "sacredness of science," but what we actually need should be the "delayed use of science," or rather, a nationwide scientific baptism. This incomplete respect for science certainly did the work of clearing the path for the advancement of science in China, but the actual work of scientific research wasted time. This error was due to the imitative mentality of quick success at the time, and secondly, to the precocious ideal of world peace. The former made us naively believe that as long as we fully absorbed, we would naturally progress. The latter made us temporarily abandon the nation's "carrying pole" and disregard the establishment of scientific national defense. More than ten years were easily wasted in revolution and foreign troubles. When the Lugou Bridge Incident expanded into a national war of resistance, the invading force that Japan relied on was scientifically equipped, while the extent to which our science and scientists could serve in combat was only similar to that of the May Fourth era. Our authorities could only painfully mark out the strategy of "trading space for time," and our soldiers and civilians could only bitterly shout out the slogan of "building the Great Wall with flesh and blood." This lesson is truly too cruel and too profound! From now on, we must painfully punish past mistakes and replace the promotion of scientific movements with actual scientific research. Scientific research in the new China must be a practical national action, a solemn task. Our government and business community should all have this understanding, and the intellectual youth who take the pursuit of knowledge as their sacred duty must have this thorough understanding, and can no longer regard "science" as a slogan and a concept, and delay themselves and the country in mediocrity and floating!

Next, let's talk about democracy. The democracy that was proclaimed in the May Fourth era did indeed do a lot of work in destroying and clearing away the chaotic politics of the warlords and the remaining vestiges of autocracy, and it had a widespread and deeply penetrating influence on society. But like science - let us use a term commonly used by Buddhists that is very clear - what was done at that time was more "breaking" than "establishing," pushing away the dregs of anti-democracy but not truly welcoming in the belief in democracy, let alone planning for a democratic system. The enlightened youth and educators of the May Fourth era were influenced by European and American democratic politics and had a great admiration for democracy but did not actually do the work of adapting to a democratic life from themselves and society. As political revolution progressed, due to military force, there were certainly many intellectual youths who participated, overthrew the warlords, and prepared for constitutional governance based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings by establishing political tutelage. In over ten years, the government failed to fully display the spirit of democracy, and there were still many internal and external reasons. However, our social progress even more failed to keep pace with the progress of politics. Our level of education and our concepts cannot produce sound local self-government personnel, cannot create universal habits of obeying the law, cannot exert the power of public opinion to restrain, and cannot easily elect national representatives, the vast majority of whom have the basic qualities of "tolerating dissenting opinions" and "obeying the majority." This is naturally due to many years of factors in various aspects, but the May Fourth Movement also sowed a fundamental error: at that time, it did not explore the true source of modern democratic politics, the civic education and law-abiding spirit of the masses. Now we have entered the stage of constitutional governance, but we cannot deny that the current national education still cannot meet the needs of constitutional governance, and we should punish and learn from past mistakes and intensify efforts to remedy the situation from the grassroots level of society. We must supervise political progress and root out corruption and mediocrity; but only if the people have the wisdom and ability to supervise the government can an unstoppable politics be established. True, broad democracy is a way of life and a cultural model. Only on top of a social culture and life with democratic manners can a democratic government truly be produced.

Science and democracy began to raise their heads in China during the May Fourth era, but they did not have rich fertilizers to nurture and grow them. Even for more than ten years, we lingered for a long time in the stage of passively destroying anti-science and anti-democracy, but the effects were not yet significant, and we failed to plant the foundations for actively establishing scientific research and democratic manners in the broader society and in academic culture. What is the fundamental reason for this? We believe that it is because the people of our country still do not know how to value the fundamental spirit of modern countries - reason. The May Fourth era was not devoid of reason, but in fact, the driving force of all activities at that time was the outpouring of emotion rather than the cultivation of intellect. It was so for the youth, it was so for the middle-aged, and it was mostly so for the entire society. A movement, of course, cannot do without passionate and sincere emotions, but it needs to be supplemented by calm and solid reason. We worship science, but we have not accepted the spirit of "love of knowledge" from reason and engaged in solid specialized research. We admire democracy, but we have not accepted the cultivation of politics from reason and increased our ability to understand and improve politics. Even today, what is expressed in the youth is still often dominated by impulsiveness and emotions. Military suppression of turmoil and economic difficulties have increased social unrest and created a climate of resentment and blame. This climate influences the youth through the middle-aged, but unfortunately, it has failed to pass the test and transformation of "reason." The passion of the May Fourth Movement is in the past, and the reason that was lacking in the May Fourth era has still not been promoted and amplified today to supplement its deficiencies. This cannot but be said to be the fundamental concern for the progress of science and the realization of constitutional governance in China!

Maintaining the true and excellent traditions of the May Fourth Movement, the passionate and forward-looking vigor, and enhancing the application of reason to supplement and amplify the spirit of the May Fourth Movement to promote the progress of science and constitutional governance in China are the fundamental needs of the new China and should also be the criteria for the efforts of our nation's youth and people from all walks of life.

### Allied GHQ in Japan Supports Japanese Industry; Hong Kong Chinese Merchants Feel Threatened; Demand British Action to Prevent Dumping of Japanese Goods

[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 3rd] Three major overseas Chinese commercial organizations here today lodged a protest with London and requested the British government to prevent what they called the dumping of Japanese goods.

### US Establishes Strong Air Force, Appropriation Bill Expected to be Approved by Congress, House Military Affairs Committee Passes Draft Law

[This newspaper reports] San Francisco, 3rd broadcast: The US House Military Affairs Committee today passed a bill by a vote of 28 to 5, stipulating that men aged 19 to 25 serve for two years, with veterans being exempt. After the passage of this bill, the strength of the Navy, Army, and Air Force can be increased from the current 1,384,500 to 2,005,882 in 1950.

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] A bill to establish a thoroughly modernized air force with 12,441 combat aircraft and 502,000 personnel is expected to be passed by Congress this week. The bill is the first appropriation for a plan to expand the existing Air Force from 55 groups to 70 groups within two years, plus 804 jet fighters and 49 of the latest heavy bombers (including 17 jet-propelled ones). The House of Representatives has already passed the bill, and the Senate, based on the recommendation of the Appropriations Committee, is expected to pass it early this week. The entire two-year plan will cost $7.5 billion, more than two and a half times the existing appropriations. Congress has exceptionally approved an additional $857 million to the government's request to expand the air force. Secretary of Defense Forrestal only requested expansion to 66 groups, but Secretary of the Air Force Symington believes that 70 groups are the minimum necessary to maintain national security in peacetime. 70 groups are only a quarter of the US Air Force's wartime strength, but are still a significant increase over pre-war strength.

[United Press, Washington, 2nd] The US Air Force, hailed by the US Congress as the new first line of defense, is planning to purchase a perfect new fleet of aircraft within five years. Procurement officials are confident in their selection of jet and propeller-driven aircraft. In the past two years, most of the work has focused on research and development, but now the focus is on practical application. The Senate will discuss this week the appropriation bill passed by the House of Representatives by an overwhelming majority, allocating $229,500,000 to the Air Force as the first year's funds for purchasing aircraft. This fund can purchase 2,900 of the 25,541 aircraft that the Air Force needs in its so-called 70-group plan. If the Senate rejects the House's additional $822 million, the Air Force will modernize according to the 55-group plan, which would allow it to use $1,473,000,000 to purchase 1,900 aircraft.

### Hodge Issues Letter to All Korean People, Condemns Soviet Enslavement of Korea, and Urges South Koreans to Participate in General Elections

[United Press, Seoul, 3rd] Lieutenant General Hodge, Commander of US Forces in South Korea, denounced on the 3rd that the "ridiculous rumors" about the United States spread by the Soviet Union are a Communist plan to make all of Korea a part of Soviet enslavement. In his letter of more than 1,000 words to the Korean people, Hodge warned: "Yielding to the Soviet plan, Korea has only one way to go to death."

Hodge recounted the process of the division of Korea into North and South due to the split between the United States and the Soviet Union, saying: "The facts are clear, the Soviet Union and its traitorous Korean pawns have done everything possible to blame the United States. They have done their best to publicize that the United States hopes to turn Korea into a colony for the United States to use as a military base. The above is of course the most absurd statement." He then criticized the North Korean government under the Communist wing, which claimed the right to rule all of Korea through a new constitution. Hodge said that those who passed the constitution were only "a few puppets who accepted the orders of foreign masters." Hodge urged the people of South Korea to participate in the May 10th vote in the US occupation zone to express "personal answers." He strongly condemned the boycott of the election by the people of North Korea, because they "fear participating in the general election, which will show their numerical inferiority and cannot betray the country to make Korea a Communist satellite country. The election they fear is monitored by impartial international observers, which is completely different from the Communist Party's deaf and dumb election."

### A Scene at Great China University: Four Male and Female Students Detained in Police Station, Pan Xiang Seriously Injured in the Head and Sent to Hospital for Treatment

Fortunately, the local police station, together with the university authorities, intervened to maintain order, and normalcy was quickly restored. After investigation, four students were found to be heavily involved and were temporarily detained at the Zhenru Police Station at 1:30 AM this morning. It is reported that the incident originated from a dispute during a sound film screening held on the evening of the 2nd by the Recreation Department of the Joint Association of the six departments, including Political Economy, where someone cut the power cord, leading to conflicting opinions among the students. Last night, more than a hundred students from Great China University went to St. John's University to attend a commemorative May Fourth Movement literary evening. After the event, at about 9:15 PM, this group of students, along with over a hundred students from St. John's University, marched towards Great China University in formation. Upon entering the campus, they shouted slogans and sang spirited songs. At that time, most of the faculty and students were already asleep.

A conflict ensued between the two sides. In the chaos, three students were injured: (1) Yu Peiji, a student of Great China University, sustained head injuries. (2) Zhang Yingran, a student of Great China University, suffered eye injuries from a silk net. (3) Pan Xiang, an off-campus student, was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment due to the severity of his injuries.

The university immediately reported the incident to the police, dispatched personnel to mediate, and the disturbance was quickly quelled. Simultaneously, they launched an investigation into the origins of the dispute and the individuals responsible for the disturbance. With the assistance of students within the university, the following was discovered: (1) Yu Peiji (a male student from the Banking Department) is suspected of leading the disturbance. (2) Hua Yun, a female student from the History and Sociology Department, is the head of the Recreation Department of the Six Departments. (3) Zhang Yingran (female). (4) Zhong Guoying (female). These students were found to be in possession of printed materials such as "May Fourth Preparatory Program." A large red paper flower was also found on Hua Yun, with a small white slip of paper attached to the back, which read, "Welcoming the eternal spring in history."

### Hundreds of Newspapers Reprint, 70 Million People Appreciate, "Believe It or Not" Author Robert Ripley Arrives in Shanghai to Seek Material

[Report from this Newspaper] Robert Ripley, the American author of "Believe It or Not" comics, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning aboard the President Cleveland to collect material, and is staying at the Cathay Hotel.

Robert Ripley is the creator of the "Believe It or Not" comics. The strange and bizarre things he depicts have swept the globe. His works are reprinted in 326 newspapers in 38 countries and in 17 different languages. It is estimated that more than 70 million people enjoy his comics every day.

How He Became Famous

Robert Ripley has been drawing "Believe It or Not" for 34 years, without a single day's interruption. His famous work was a story about aviator Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic. Everyone knows that Lindbergh was the first to cross the Atlantic, but his comic said: "Lindbergh was the 67th person to fly across the Atlantic non-stop." In fact, he was right, because although Lindbergh was the hero who initiated and completed the first flight across the Atlantic, in his flight, there were two planes and two airships, and he himself piloted the last plane. There were exactly 66 people sitting in the first plane and the two airships.

Loves Traveling

For example, Ripley gathered such surprising facts with a lot of effort. He himself loves to travel, and Duke Windsor has called him the "Modern Marco Polo". Almost every remote corner of the world has his footprints, and all the novel things he sees and hears become good materials for his writing. In addition, readers all over the world contribute to him, and he receives tens of thousands of letters every year. In order to organize these materials, he employs a large number of staff to carry out verification work to explore whether these strange things have a basis and to decide whether to adopt them. For the materials he adopts, the payment depends on the value of the content, usually about five US dollars per item.

Born Poor

Like the strange things in his writing, Robert Ripley himself is also a strange person. He is 56 years old this year, but he is still single. He is in excellent health, never smokes, and never plays poker. He draws his comics upside down. He was born into poverty. His father was a carpenter who died when he was twelve. When he was a child, he picked up tennis balls for others to earn money to supplement his family. Later, he used his talent to draw posters, and then worked as a sports cartoonist for a newspaper. His first "Believe It or Not" was unintentionally accomplished. After being published, it was unexpectedly welcomed by readers, and he gradually became famous.

### Chinese Readers Actively Contribute

This time he came to the East to collect material, from Manila via Hong Kong to Shanghai, and will fly to Tokyo in three days. His "Believe It or Not" comics are reprinted in the English Continental Daily in this city. Since the news that he was coming to Shanghai was announced, many Chinese readers have contributed to the Continental Daily to pass on to him. These contributions include the "Immortal Maiden" who was recently discovered in Chongqing and has not eaten for nine years, abstruse mathematical diagrams, and illustrated explanations of Chinese characters. One letter contained a 5,000-yuan banknote, and the contributor said that the banknote was used after being signed on a certain day and returned to his own hands on the same day a year later. Even more simply, a pair of letters wrote this sentence: "The Continental Daily is the only Chinese newspaper that publishes Robert Ripley's comics." Yesterday, Ripley showed reporters a large pile of these letters and said with a smile that he had not had time to look at them carefully yet.

### Gu Zhuxuan's Age Becomes an Issue, Refugees Accuse Him of Extorting Money Through Longevity, Unsigned Accusation Claims Justification

[Report from this Newspaper] Gu Zhuxuan, the boss of Tianchan Dance Hall, was accused yesterday by a group of Northern Jiangsu refugees to the District Prosecutor's Office, claiming that Gu was extorting money through his birthday and stealing relief rice. The complaint stated that Gu turned 60 years old on April 22 this year, but in reality, Gu is 63 years old, which can be proven by his household registration. Before the birthday, he sent out invitations everywhere, and the Northern Jiangsu refugees all contributed money to celebrate his birthday. It is estimated that Gu's birthday income reached more than 4 billion yuan, and a golden plaque with the words "Virtue Covers the Jianghuai" was publicly presented and is still hanging in Gu's home. Also, last year's refugee relief rice, each person was allocated two dou, and the rice money was 24,000 yuan, but as a result, the rice was not distributed, and Gu and others embezzled and divided it. The end of the complaint was signed by Northern Jiangsu refugees and explained the reason for not signing their names, because they were refugees living abroad and were currently living in refugee shelters. If their real names were known to Gu, they were at risk of being expelled from the refugee shelters. The District Prosecutor's Office will summon the relevant persons for questioning in the coming days.

### All 30 Fishing Vessels of the Fisheries Management Office are Piloted by Chinese

### Compensation Period for Public Educators' Public Grain Substitute Still Limited to One Month

[Report from this Newspaper] Public educators in this city who do not need to purchase physical rice and flour can exchange them for differential payments.

Now, the deadline for the cash payment of public grain provided at no cost has also been instructed by the Food Department in a telegram that it will still be one month after the expiration of the monthly physical distribution. Overdue applications will not be accommodated. The Grain General Warehouse has begun to comply with the instructions since March and has sent a letter to the Municipal Public Educators' Materials Supply Committee for verification.

### Commemorating the May Fourth Movement, Shanghai Students' Bonfire Rally, Zhu Jingnong Expresses Thoughts

[Report from this Newspaper] Today is the 29th anniversary of the "May Fourth" New Culture Movement. The cultural circles of this city will gather at the Cultural Hall at 9:00 AM this morning to celebrate enthusiastically. In addition, the students of major middle and high schools in this city are scheduled to hold a 25,000-person "May Fourth" bonfire rally at Jiaotong University tonight to perform various commemorative programs. Also, Jiaotong, Tongji, and St. John's universities held literary evenings last night, inviting Cao Weifeng, Zhang Choubo, Meng Xianzhang, and Xia Kangnong to attend and give speeches. The students from nearby middle and high schools who participated were very enthusiastic. Jiaotong University also held an exhibition of student sports photos and cartoons and published a "May Fourth" commemorative special issue.

[Report from this Newspaper] Zhu Jingnong, President of Guanghua University, attended the National Assembly and returned to Shanghai the other day. Yesterday, in response to a request from a reporter of this newspaper, he expressed his personal thoughts on the "May Fourth" New Culture Movement, saying: "I was studying abroad in the United States at the time and had not yet returned to China. Some people said that I was also a leading figure at the time, which is a mistake." Zhu believes that the achievements of the "May Fourth" Movement, in a positive aspect, lie in advocating democracy and science, both of which have true and permanent value. Science has two functions: one is to use scientific methods to study various disciplines and sort out our country's ancient books and history; the other is to promote science itself. Although our country's science has not yet been fully developed, in the past 30 years, due to the occurrence of the "May Fourth" Movement, the Chinese people have known the importance of science, which is a phenomenon of progress. In a negative aspect, President Zhu believes that the aestheticism advocated by Mr. Cai Yuanpei has not been adequately recognized and worked on by the Chinese people, so the achievements are not significant, especially the slogan "Labor is Sacred" shouted at that time, which the general youth did not put into practice. Life is education, and I have always advocated "hands are omnipotent". No matter how biased the thinking of young people is, they should all move in this direction, and I hope that the society will pay attention to it in the future.

The first torchbearer is Xu Dianyun, who is carrying the President's inscription on his back and holding the torch.

### Short-Distance Star Liu Changchun Speaks About Athletes from the Northeast

[Our Newspaper] On the medium landing craft, among the crowd wearing plain uniforms symbolizing "White Mountains and Black Waters," I found Liu Changchun, the short-distance star who had participated in three National Games and created a national record of 10.7 seconds in the 100-meter dash. Nearly eight years had passed. A few strands of white hair made him sigh softly: "I am already 39 years old this year."

For the past few years, he has been teaching physical education at Zhongzheng University in Pan Yang. This time, he is leading a large army south in the name of general manager. I hoped he could tell me some miracles, or that under his training and cultivation, the Northeast would have someone who could at least be on par with "10.7 seconds." However, it brought him a bellyful of emotion: "This cannot be compared with before the war," he said. "After the victory, the situation in the Northeast has been tense, and the emotions of those in training have been greatly discounted. In the 100-meter dash, they can only achieve results of 11.4 or 5 seconds."

The icy and snowy weather especially limits the athletes' ability to perform. Liu Changchun said, "When we left the Northeast, the ground had just begun to melt and the grass and trees were just sprouting, so we never had the opportunity to accurately measure or record the actual strength of our athletes." He humbly stated that he had no ambition or confidence in winning any prizes this time. A week before their departure, they still had not decided whether to come or not because of money. He said to the reporter, "Although there is not enough funding, everyone feels that it is necessary to come, so the purpose of this trip is still focused on the spirit, because we really have no achievements to brag about to others."

After repeated requests from the reporter, he slightly revealed some items that he thought were relatively presentable. Li Linghui's 800-meter run has a time of 2 minutes and 4 seconds, and the intermediate hurdle has a time of 57.7 seconds, which is relatively close to the national records of 2 minutes and 2.2 seconds and 58.3 seconds. Secondly, Guo Jianzhang's discus throw is 38.5 meters, and the sixteen-pound shot put is 12.3 meters.

These are not enough to rely on. As many people expect, we will be surprised and encouraged by an unexpected dark horse!

### Hong Kong Volleyball Team Defeats Huayan Three to Two

[Our Newspaper] After the Hong Kong volleyball team arrived in Shanghai yesterday, they went to St. John's University in Fanhuangdu to play a friendly match with the city's Huayan team. After five sets of intense fighting, the visiting team won three to two.

The Hong Kong team is represented by the champion of the selection competition, St. Paul's College, so their coordination and tacit understanding are superior. They and the Heshan team, which represents the police, both have hopes of winning the championship.

The Hong Kong team's defense is better than its offense. The front row locks down the net, demonstrating great skill. The three-row saves are too demonstrative.

The entire Huayan team was present, and Kong Xiangji was also invited to help, but it was still difficult to challenge the visitors.

Before the match, the visiting team presented two banners to Huayan and the host St. John's, each receiving one.

Qi Jianhong from the Special Service School of the Joint Logistics Headquarters officiated the match. His quick eyes and sharp tongue added a lot of color to the game.

Xinjiang athletes also came to watch the game, all wearing black tops and red hats, and were received by Dong Jun, a reporter from the John's Sports Weekly, and visited the entire school.

[Our Newspaper Special] The football championship battles of the Sixth National Games once swept hundreds of thousands of Chinese and foreign fans. In particular, the battles between the four strongest teams, Hong Kong, Malayan Chinese, Guangdong, and Shanghai, gave the audience countless tense and thrilling memories. Thirteen years have passed. Now the four heroes' flags meet again in the old place. It can be said that enemies meet, especially red eyes. Of course, there will be another fierce battle. Compared with the previous session, eight teams are missing: Lu, Anhui, Ping, Xiang, Gan, Ji, and Qinghai and Liaoning. However, nine teams have been added: Guizhou, Dalian, Siam, Hankou, the Philippines, and the Five Armies. Speaking of momentum, it is indeed more vast than the previous session; speaking of lineup, the configuration is also extremely neat; talking about talent, although the World Games team has taken away a lot of elite, there are still many veterans and newcomers among the 21 teams. What's more, it is rare for the four strongest teams and the Five Armies to meet. How could this close-quarters battle not be wonderful?

Many of the twenty-one teams have never shown their faces in Shanghai. Here, let's take a look at them first:

The entire fourteen-member Sichuan team was almost entirely selected in Chengdu, including six from West China University, two from the Provincial Sports College, two from Sichuan University, and three civil servants. Only one person participated from outside the county. Because the team was formed not long ago, there was no time to practice, so they set off for Shanghai. It is difficult for the team to coordinate as ideally as they would like. The defensive line, in particular, is a weaker link. The forward configuration is slightly stronger. Right inside forward Chen Mingdao can be called a genius in personal technique. Long passes, short passes, shooting, and rushing are all excellent. It is a pity that there is a lack of cooperation, which is a fly in the ointment. Otherwise, if they attack to defend, they can barely make up for the weakness of the rear. Goalkeeper Xi Zhaolong is still considered stable and is a well-chosen talent from the Provincial Sports College. Whether he can maintain a stable situation in the first battle against the police will depend on how he displays his skills of blocking left and right.

The Henan team's lineup has been arranged:

Wang Tianxiang Liu Minsheng

Zhang Jimin Guan Xinyou

Yan Shaozu Chai Juzhen Yang Xishan

Yuan Shan Shan Yi-wang Cheng Pengqian Zhang Juzhen Guo Shichang

Like Sichuan, the team's selection is limited to Kaifeng, so students account for as many as thirteen of the team's seventeen members: ten from Yuda and three from Kai Normal. Amateurs make up only four people. The advantage of forming a team with students is that they are agile and have plenty of physical strength, but the disadvantage is that they have less experience and insufficient skills. Most of the team members participated in the Central China Games held in Hankou, winning several games. In the end, they lost to Hunan. At that time, Shan Yiwang charged forward and Chai Juzhen echoed back and forth. Their rapid short passes really won a lot of praise. This shows that they would not have been able to do this without physical strength. This time, the team will encounter a strong enemy, Guangdong, in the first battle. Putting aside the victory or defeat, just looking at the physical strength shown by this group of young athletes from Central China in their running and chasing is enough to make us yearn for them.

The Guizhou team can be said to be the best-spirited team in this National Games football team. Of the fifteen members of the team, Xue Wenxiu, the secretary-general of the provincial government, personally serves as the captain and also doubles as the center forward, commanding the three armies. Luo Shiqi, director of the Fourth Police Bureau of Guizhou, protects the liaison line and guards the center. Just looking at these two titles, you can imagine how energetic this team is! The team members include students, civil servants, businessmen, and citizens. It is completely a miscellaneous army. However, the diversity of their positions does not affect their confidence in their own spirit. When they learned that they would be facing the strong army of the Army or Qingdao in the first battle, they said that they would put the victory or defeat aside and remain consistent throughout the battle, not being afraid or shrinking back, and doing their best to the end.

The strength of the Hankou team is quite solid and average. Main general Zhang Dejiang is a famous football player in North China. Center backs Cheng Ruiyun and Yang Shuanggui are the famous and earthshaking duo in Wuhan. Defender Sun Shunxiang, a famous general from the Ping-Han team, is responsible for difficult tasks. The goalkeeper is Ye Tao, a basketball player from Hankou. The team is based on eight members of the Ping-Han team, plus two air force members and two students. The eight members of the Ping-Han team have all made a name for themselves in several large and small football battles in Hubei Province, especially Cheng, Yang, and Sun. The team's weakness lies in the slightly weaker goalkeeper, but in the future, they can rely on the help of the center and rear defensive lines. There are many good football players in Hankou, but this time they were dispersed due to the separate efforts of Hankou, Hubei Province, and the Joint Logistics Command to win them over. A major highlight was thus broken down into smaller parts. This time, the team will face the Air Force in the first battle. A fierce battle is inevitable when two strong teams meet. Whether the team will make progress in the future depends on how the five forwards under the command of Zhang Dejiang connect and pass. Whether the team can defend firmly depends on how Cheng, Yang, and Sun intercept and echo each other.

### The Mayor Decides Not to Bring His Wife: Post Office Booths Used as Ticket Offices

[Our Newspaper] The Seventh National Games will open tomorrow. The opening ceremony will be held at 3:00 PM at the Jiangwan Municipal Sports Stadium. The Organizing Committee of the Games has also sent invitations to the diplomatic community, government leaders, and business leaders in the city to attend the ceremony. About a thousand invitations have been sent, but the seats on the West Commander's Platform of the venue are limited. If the invited guests bring their families with them, there will be no way to accommodate them. However, it is not possible to indicate "one person per invitation" and enter the venue with the invitation. According to Vice Chairman of the Games and Chairman of the Organizing Committee Mayor Wu, he has decided not to bring his wife. If his sons and daughters want to come, they must buy tickets to enter the venue, setting an example.

For the opening ceremony on the first day, those who want to participate as citizens of the city must buy tickets to enter the venue, which is of great concern to a group of gentlemen and ladies. According to news from the ticketing section of the Games, the Games has borrowed ten post office booths from the post office and distributed them around the venue as ticket booths. These square-shaped booths have windows on all four sides, and four people can buy tickets at the same time each time. Ten ticket booths mean there are forty ticket offices. When the time comes, buying tickets should not be too difficult. Moreover, these forty ticket sellers are all women, which can avoid all kinds of abuses such as holding and manipulating tickets. Tickets for the opening ceremony on the first day are divided into two types: 200,000 yuan and 50,000 yuan.

### Striving for the Spirit Trophy: Police Commissioner Xuan Tiewu Encourages Athletes from Five Units

[Our Report] With the 7th National Games about to begin, the five units of the National Army, Navy, Air Force, Police, and Joint Logistics Command are participating for the first time. Police Commissioner Xuan Tiewu, to express goodwill, hosted all the representatives at the Ciro's nightclub yesterday (3rd) at 3 PM. Except for the 120 Air Force representatives, led by President Hu Yike and Chief of Staff Zhou Yichen, who will arrive in Shanghai tonight and were unable to attend, there were 85 Navy representatives, 100 Army representatives, 126 Police representatives, and 100 Joint Logistics Command representatives. Guests included Port Commander Zhou Lixing, Wusong Fortress Commander Shao Baichang, Air Force Base Commander Wang Weimin, Deputy Commander Sun Tonggang, and Garrison Commander Fu Zhengmo, totaling over 400 people. The hall was set up in the dance floor, with the national flag in the center and slogans "Unite to Save the Nation" and "Suppress Bandits to Save the People" on both sides, creating a solemn and magnificent atmosphere. After the meeting began, Commissioner Xuan delivered a speech, stating that soldiers have organization, training, obedience to orders, and discipline. With these excellent traditions, he hoped that they could show them to the athletes and spectators, and win the intangible spirit trophy, which is more valuable than the tangible one. Guests and team leaders Commander Shao Baichang, Commander Dong Mozen, Commander Wang Weimin, Commander Zhou Lixing, and Bureau Chief Yu Shuping then gave speeches, encouraging all athletes to demonstrate the spirit of "good soldiers as role models for good citizens." Finally, the Army representative gave a thank-you speech. After that, refreshments were served, and the Chinese Harmonica Society played famous songs, including a victory march titled "Return Our Rivers and Mountains," which won applause from the entire audience. Everyone was uncontrollably filled with emotion and cheered "Long Live the Republic of China" repeatedly. The grand event ended joyfully around 4 PM.

### Temporary Post Office During the Games

[Our Report] To facilitate the mailing of letters and remittances for the National Games personnel and spectators, the post office has set up two temporary post offices during the Games:

The first one is located next to the east grandstand of the venue, open from 9 AM to 6 PM daily. Services include selling stamps, mailing letters, savings and remittances, and selling philatelic stamps.

The second one is located at the athlete dormitory of the Central Training Corps on Shuishui Road, open from 6 AM to 10 PM daily. The services are the same as the first one. At the same time, a mobile post office car will be dispatched to provide services throughout the venue. It is also said that the post office will use a specially made date stamp for commemoration.

### Rushing to Finish, Most Afraid of Wet Paint: The Three-Event Female Athletes Show Their Talents

[Our Special Report] In just one day and one night, the great show will begin. Those making advertising boards in the stadium, opening temporary shops, and rushing to complete the sports fields are all creating "miracles": to complete everything in a few dozen hours. My biggest worry is: if the weather is bad today (4th), won't the wet paint on the signs of many shops and the newly painted basketball hoops be ruined?

On both sides of the road leading to the venue, small shops and newspaper offices stand side by side, like a small and prosperous town. Although the "materials" of those houses are only thin bamboo and plywood, the exteriors are brightly colored in red and green, heavily decorated, and with innovative designs, using all possible methods. This is what is called "Shanghai style."

Shen Bao's office has two rooms, "close" to each other. One side has a large Earth brand electric clock, and the other has a thermometer as big as a burly man (borrowed from the Shanghai Science Factory). These two giant objects will be serving the public non-stop during the games.

Due to continuous rain in recent days, the track and field is full of water-filled traps. Yesterday, they were rushing to "pave" the track. I hope it doesn't rain again today!

The paint on the gym floor is not yet dry, and the boundaries of the courts were just painted yesterday.

Tickets for students and groups are priced at 20,000 yuan per ticket, and many staff members are working hard to stamp them.

Prizes are arriving one after another, mostly silver shields, such as the "Martial Spirit" award from the City Council. The reporter has always felt that the prizes for each National Games are mostly the same, and the format always feels plain and unremarkable. The types are nothing more than shields, cups, flags... After a long time, they inevitably feel a bit vulgar. I hope that people who like to use their brains can create more meaningful forms of prizes.

Yue Sui [Guangdong and Guangzhou] team member said, "It's already the changing season in Guangdong, but I didn't expect to see so many people wearing coats when I arrived in Shanghai. I was very surprised. Sure enough, a cold wind blew and I got goosebumps, so many athletes caught colds."

Mr. Wen Feng, the leader of the Sichuan team, said that their more promising events are shot put and the women's 50-meter race. Their individual skills in football are also very good, but the coordination is lacking. Their standards for selecting athletes are based on the top three in track events and the top six in field events in the previous National Games. The athletes participating in national martial arts are even more outstanding, selected from the two best out of the eight best in the province. Among the 25 athletes: eight are from West China University, three are from Sichuan University, two are from the Institute of Physical Education, and others include the head of the Education Department of the Provincial Government, etc.

The female athletes from Guizhou moved from Shang Lian Su to the Great Church at 4 PM yesterday. Each of them carried two large bundles of luggage: some were calm and unhurried, while others were sweating profusely. It turned out that some were three-event athletes, while others were just good at basketball.

The athletes from Hankou City complained bitterly, saying that the hospitality of the conference was too disappointing. In addition, their own funding was insufficient, and prices in Shanghai were expensive, so most of the athletes stayed indoors and kept to themselves. The athletes from Guizhou only observed the situation. In the large dormitory, beds were arranged horizontally, and snores rose and fell.

The athletes from Xinjiang each wore a red hat with a registered trademark, which could be easily identified from a distance.

Jin Zengcheng, the former head of the Guangdong team in the first three National Games, is now elderly. He recently came to Shanghai after participating in the National Assembly. He said, "It is expected that this National Games will not have excellent results. However, I still encourage all athletes."

The athletes from Northeast China arrived in Shanghai by landing craft yesterday. They had experienced many hardships along the way. The athletes from Hankou sympathized with them, saying that they had not slept for three days on the ship, and the train ride was bumpy and unfamiliar. They had no place to complain.

Athletes from all over the country are visiting a foreign land and miss their homes very much. The post office has an office in Jingye Hall, and business is booming.

### Preparatory Committee's Work Proceeding Smoothly: Ministry of Education Expresses Gratitude to All Committees

[Our Report] The second meeting of the preparatory committee for the 7th National Games was held at 3 PM yesterday in the City Government Conference Room. Those present included Chairman Wu Guozhen (Chairman), Committee Members Hang Liwu, Wang Zhengting, Li Ximou, Fang Zhi, Zhao Zengjue, Zhao Zukang, Xi Yushu, Zhang Wei, and Secretary-General Hao Gengsheng, totaling more than 20 people. First, Deputy Minister of Education Hang Liwu stated that the smooth progress of the conference was due to the efforts of Mayor Wu, all committee members, and Secretary-General Hao, and expressed gratitude on behalf of the Ministry of Education. Secretary-General Hao then reported on the ratification and appointment of additional committee members, which were all approved item by item. Due to the limited funding for the conference, ticket revenue will be used to supplement the funds, and in order to improve the facilities of the venue and dormitory, it was decided that representatives from each committee and the press will gather at the City Government at 2:30 PM this afternoon to go to Jiangwan to inspect the dormitory and sports field.

### National Games Briefs

The Guizhou Association in Shanghai will hold a gathering to welcome the Guizhou representatives attending the National Games at the Yiyuan Hotel on Albert Road at 4 PM today.

According to the Meteorological Observatory, the weather on the first day of the National Games (May 5th) will be sunny without a doubt, and the temperature will also be higher than the current one, around 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit, which is good weather for sports.

20,000 copies of the National Games program have been sold yesterday. Although the price is as high as 160,000 yuan per copy, they were sold out as soon as they hit the market. However, the "athletes" feel overwhelmed by this "high price."

### Jilin Athletes Disguise Themselves as Refugees, Shoes Worn Out Crossing Bandit Areas

[Our Report] In addition to Wang Yongfang and Zhang Pu, two representatives from Jilin Province who arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, and team leader Wang Shizhen, representatives Wang Fuhai, Wang Shide, Wang Fulin, and Qi Baozhu, five people who will arrive in Shanghai today, He Pei, Shan Yongli, Wang Jun, and three other representatives from the province arrived in the city by China Airlines plane from Ping on the afternoon of yesterday (3rd). When the reporter met them at the airport, their faces were dark and haggard, their hair was disheveled, and they looked extremely weak and tired. According to them, "The three of us left Changchun on April 17th, disguised as refugees all the way, walking south along the China-Chang Railway. When we crossed the bandit-occupied area, we experienced all kinds of hardships and suffered greatly, which cannot be described in words. After ten days, we finally arrived in Shenyang on the 26th, but our shoes were worn out and our feet were broken, and we were no longer human-like. However, the comfort and joy we felt at that time far outweighed the pain we had suffered." The demonstration of the inherent spirit and perseverance of the compatriots in the Northeast is truly a commendable and moving moment in this conference.

### Fate Anecdotes: The World of "White Stripes in the Waves" - The Front Waves Push the Back Waves, Two Pairs of Sisters Emerge - The Fierce Generals Liu, Cai, and Chen - Look Like Three Shadow Boats

[Our Special Report] Yesterday afternoon, the Zhongqing warm water swimming pool became the world of white stripes in the waves. The best male and female swimmers in the country were almost all in the pool.

Looking around, Shanghai, the Philippines, Yue Sui [Guangdong and Guangzhou], Taiwan... and the strongest Hong Kong team, have all come.

The stands were crowded with people. The edge of the pool was buzzing with conversations. Everyone was focused, you watched my posture, I spied on your strength. Nothing else, just wanting to know yourself and your enemy, and win every battle.

The five strong players from the Philippines arrived earlier. They were practicing freestyle, backstroke, and other strokes in the pool, all of which they are good at, and their results are very impressive.

However, they felt that the water temperature and weather in Shanghai were too cold. The usual water temperature in Philippine swimming pools is always around 95 degrees Fahrenheit. The warm water pool in Zhongqing is only 70 degrees Fahrenheit.

It is expected that the water temperature of the swimming pool in this conference will not be higher than the water temperature in Zhongqing, so they are worried that their results will not be as ideal.

Looking at the highest swimming records created by overseas Chinese in the Philippines eight years ago, the freestyle 50 meters is 27.8 seconds, the 100 meters is 62 seconds, the 400 meters is 5 minutes and 32 seconds, the 100-meter backstroke is 1 minute and 19 seconds, and the 200-meter breaststroke is 2 minutes and 58 seconds, almost every item can break the national record.

Around 3 o'clock, the Yue Sui team arrived, and the large Hong Kong team also arrived. The swimming room suddenly became lively.

When meeting with Hong Kong team leader Pan Yongkai and manager Huang Shaoxiong, when talking about Hong Kong's chances of winning, they were all humble and said, "Not necessarily! Not necessarily!"

The most eye-catching in the pool are the two pairs of sisters from Yue Sui and Hong Kong. The Yue Sui sisters are named Zheng Yanying and Zheng Xueying, and the Hong Kong sisters are named Huang Wanzhen and Huang Wansheng.

The Yue Sui Zheng sisters, Yanying is 14 years old and Xueying is 13 years old. They look like young children who are less than five feet tall. They only started training last August, and they were surprisingly successful in the selection competition this year!

Yanying's 100-meter backstroke is 1 minute and 54 seconds, Xueying's 200-meter breaststroke is 3 minutes and 49 seconds, and her 400-meter freestyle is 8 minutes and 32 seconds. Young children have achieved such extraordinary results after short-term training, isn't it a miracle!

The Zheng sisters are from Yanbu Township in Guangdong. There is a small stream opposite their house in their hometown. It was in this small stream that they were trained by their father, creating the only two female swimming representatives for the Yue Sui team to attend this National Games.

Their hometown is quite far from Guangzhou. Their father is in the firecracker business. But after discovering his daughters' talents, he quickly trained them and sent them to Guangzhou to participate in the selection, and the results were as desired.

There are three sisters in their family, the youngest is only twelve years old, and she is also swimming in the stream. In the next National Games, the Yue Sui team will have another female swimming star.

Xu Heng, a famous general who watched them practice swimming in Zhongqing, said: The Zheng sisters, whether from the perspective of posture, speed, age, etc., have a truly remarkable future.

The Hong Kong Huang sisters are much more mature in age, figure, and demeanor than the Zheng sisters. Wanzhen is 18 years old and Wansheng is 14 years old. They are tall and graceful, light and agile, with watery eyes that are slightly sunken and bright, with some Western flavor.

Yesterday noon, they arrived in port on the President Cleveland wheel with their mother, He Jialu. As soon as they got off the pier, they followed their mother to Zhongqing to practice, not relaxing for even a bit.

He Jialu is the leader of the Hong Kong women's swimming team. She attributes the achievements of her two children to the father's unremitting training. It is said that they not only practice on-site, but also conduct scientific research based on specialized books on swimming technology from various countries around the world.

Let me tell you a few of the highest records, Wanzhen's freestyle 50 meters is 35.12 seconds, and her 100 meters is 81 seconds. Wansheng's 200-meter breaststroke is 3 minutes and 37 seconds. It seems that this time the national record will be completely broken!

Originally, their home was on the beach in Hong Kong, with a unique environment.

They only officially joined the Hong Kong Lijin team for practice in April last year, and they had been unknown in the past. In October last year, they created several national records at the Liangguang Flood Relief Competition, and two new comets were finally discovered.

The Huang sisters are both studying at St. Stephen's Girls' College in Hong Kong. Wanzhen is in the second year of high school, and Wansheng is in the first year of junior high school.

Before leaving, Jialu said: The children are still young, and it is not yet time to praise them, I hope everyone will give more guidance and supervision, so that they know what to be vigilant about.

Seeing the rise of the two pairs of sisters Zheng and Huang in the South, one cannot help but recall the Yang Xiuqiong and Yang Xiuzhen sisters who dominated the 6th National Games. The waves behind the Yangtze River push the waves ahead, and after all, today's people are better than the ancients, which is gratifying and sighing!

The Hong Kong team's fierce generals Liu Dibing, Cai Liheng, and Chen Zhennan were swimming back and forth in the pool, shoulder to shoulder. They were all freestyle swimmers, and as they swam together, all that could be seen was white waves, like three high-speed mosquito boats.

Liu Dibing, a rising star in short-distance swimming, is participating in the National Games with the ambition to break the record. Watching him paddle vigorously, with his feet beating rhythmically, and his breathing just right, everything is clear and beautiful, and this ambition is likely to be realized.

Chen Zhennan, a veteran of middle-distance swimming, is broad-minded and fat. He has been in the swimming world for more than ten years, and his energy has not diminished. In this session, the freestyle 400-meter and 1500-meter events must belong to Chen, and the record can also be broken.

The cross-sea record maintained by Chen Zhennan in Hong Kong has not yet been broken.

The Yue Sui team feels that the water polo arrangement of the conference is unfair. The winning teams of the first day's games, Shanghai vs. Philippines and Air Force vs. Yue Sui, will be able to play against Hong Kong and Malaysia China respectively on the second day. Hong Kong and Malaysia take advantage, while the Philippines, Air Force, and Yue Sui suffer.

If transportation improves in the future, it may increase this month. As for the coal allocation for private factories, it was not implemented last month due to the lack of coal sources. It will start this month.

### White Japonica Rice Sees New High Price Again: Flour, Coarse Grains, and Oil Cakes All Prospering

The rice market continued to rise yesterday. Although the Wuxi price was slightly lower, because the price in the city was lower than the production area, showing an inverted phenomenon, the cargo owners were still unwilling to sell cheaply and tried hard to maintain the price. The North City market generally rose by 100,000 yuan, and the special high-grade Japonica rice saw a new high price of 4,450,000 yuan. In the South City market, white Japonica rice rose by 150,000 to 200,000 yuan, thin rice rose by 170,000 to 180,000 yuan, and white yuan rice rose to 4,700,000 yuan, an increase of 200,000 yuan. Coarse Japonica rice opened at 3,550,000 yuan and closed at 3,650,000 yuan. The total arrival of goods in the North and South cities yesterday was 7,274 piculs.

Flour is firm in price due to high prices in the interior and rising rice prices. The opening and closing price of Bingchuan flour was 1,460,000 yuan, with little fluctuation in between, an increase of 40,000 yuan. Lao Che flour was 1,455,000 yuan, an increase of 35,000 yuan. Hongfeng, Jiancheng, and other miscellaneous brands of flour all increased by more than 30,000 yuan. Wheat bran rose by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, and wheat rose by 2,100,000 yuan, an increase of 100,000 yuan.

Coarse grains all prospered. The Yantai gang bought Jiujiang winter soybeans, which revitalized the market and increased by 150,000 yuan. Broad beans also increased by 150,000 to 200,000 yuan. Green and Yantai gangs patronized corn, which rose by 150,000 yuan. Red sorghum rose by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. The old stocks of selected green goods are running low, and new goods have yet to appear, so they soared by 200,000 yuan. Green beans rose by 100,000 yuan, and sesame seeds increased by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. The Guangdong gang absorbed raw peanuts strongly, which increased by 600,000 to 700,000 yuan.

The rise in edible oil became more prevalent. The oil factory opened the price of soybean oil above the 9 million yuan mark, but the actual sales were very good, and the market was firm. The back-to-cage goods had a final high of 9,250,000 yuan for soybean oil, a sharp increase of 450,000 yuan. Jichuan raw oil first opened at 10,500,000 yuan, and then the Jiangbei Jichuan raw oil also called high to 10,700,000 yuan, a frenzy of 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Rapeseed sesame oil and clear oil each rose by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. The small cart of sesame seed rose first by 500,000 yuan and then again by 500,000 yuan. Soybean cake rose by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan.

### Large Batch of American Rice Arrives

[Our Report] The American vessel S.S. Kuralea Lau Beishu (transliteration), carrying 57,000 bags of rice and 7,000 tons of gasoline from San Francisco, arrived in Shanghai at around 10 AM yesterday. It first docked at the Texaco pier to unload gasoline. After the oil was unloaded, it moved to the floating dock to unload rice. The China Merchants Bureau's Haifei vessel, carrying 5,091 tons of sugar from Kaohsiung, totaling 7,326 bags, is expected to arrive in Shanghai last night or this morning and stop at the North Wharf to unload.

### Market Conditions in Various Places

Zhenjiang [Our Zhenjiang dispatch on the 3rd] The price of grain in Zhenjiang has risen sharply due to the rush of grain merchants from various counties in northern Jiangsu to purchase rice, approaching the 5 million yuan mark. Slightly weaker today due to recent adventures, but upper-grade rice still stands at 4,700,000 yuan, and middle-grade rice at 4,500,000 yuan.

Baoding [Our Baoding dispatch on the 3rd] Prices in Baoding are soaring. Tongfen opened at 2,600,000 yuan today, coal balls are 450,000 yuan per hundred catties, and Erchang Wufu fine cloth is 5,900,000 yuan.

Nanchang [Our Nanchang dispatch on the 3rd] Another wave of price increases in the Nanchang market. Rice broke the 3 million yuan mark, with retail prices called at 3,200,000 yuan. Foreign yarn and cloth are all rising.

### Tung Oil Purchase Price Remains Unchanged

The Pricing Committee for the Purchase of Important Export Goods held a routine meeting at the China Trust Bureau yesterday afternoon. As a result, the purchase price of tung oil remained unchanged. It is reported that Shanghai has purchased a total of 600 dans, Guangzhou 85 zu, and Wuzhou 15 dans. According to industry insiders, the origin reported an increase in prices recently, so the Nawi [?] of the Hankou, Wanxian, and Chongqing gangs are more concentrated.

### The Market is Excited: Yarn and Cloth Continue to Soar

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was still firm, with Tianjin and Guangdong gangs continuing to trade strongly, and prices reached new highs. The 42-count Lanfeng fine yarn jumped by 2 million yuan at the opening, and later there were rumors that the exchange rate would be raised, and the market was even more excited. Bullish investors and retail investors pushed up the market even more, and the market climbed again to close at the 250 million mark. It continued to rise by 8 million yuan compared to the end of last weekend. The 21-count Shuangma yarn was heavily hyped, with a huge increase of 11 million yuan. The remaining coarse and fine yarns also increased by 4 million to 10 million yuan.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market opened steadily. Customers only made small purchases from Changjiang gang. Local business was slow and few purchases from big names. Dyeing mills generally took a wait-and-see attitude. Longtou fine cloth once fell to 5,050,000. Then, because the Changjiang gang favored spot goods, the price returned to 5,090,000 at the close. This was a rise of 60,000 compared to the end of last weekend. The other Wufu, Lanj, Caiqiu and other fine cloths also followed slightly higher. Plain cloth rose by 30,000 because of Jinagxi and Guangdong purchases. Other cloth markets were also firm.

Furthermore, according to news: the Wufu B-character fine cloth, for which textile mills supply for sale, had a purchase permit increase of 60,000 yuan last Saturday. The purchase permit for the Four Gentlemen yuan plain cloth initially increased by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, to 4,770,000 to 4,780,000 yuan, and there were sales. In the end, it increased by 80,000 yuan. The final shipment of Longtou fine cloth tomorrow had buyers at 5,160,000 yuan, and the market was very promising.

### China Agricultural and Industrial Trust Purchases Second Batch of National Cotton on Behalf

[Our Report] The China Agricultural and Industrial Trust Department previously agreed to purchase 100,000 dans of the second batch of national cotton on behalf. It is reported that 18,000 dans have been purchased in Hankou and Xi'an. The 350 billion yuan fund previously allocated by the Yarn and Fiber Committee has been exhausted, and negotiations are currently underway for a second allocation to continue the purchase. It is said that if there are no problems with the funds, the purchase can be completed within this month. Furthermore, the cotton stored in Xi'an will be airlifted to Shanghai, with a cost of over 20 million yuan per dan.

### Business Briefs

Local Pharmaceutical Industry Request to Relax Import Quotas for Raw Materials: The Bureau of Industry and Commerce will conduct a preliminary investigation before deciding whether to apply to the Import and Export Control Commission.

Regarding the Local Gasoline Allocation Issue: The gasoline allocation committee's repeated requests to the Import and Export Control Commission for increased allocation have been ineffective. It is said they will directly appeal to the Executive Yuan.

The Central Bank Discount Committee held its second meeting yesterday to discuss seven loan applications that had been reviewed and commented on by the Industry and Mining Committee, as well as other related discount matters.

The "Economic Knowledge Lecture" organized by the Local Banking Association will be held at 7:30 PM tonight on the third floor of the Qian Le Guild Hall, with Mr. Sun Juncun lecturing on "China's Grand Plan."

Yesterday's timber market saw a slight increase in foreign pine, but sales remained stagnant with limited transactions. Although the origin price of cedar rose, actual sales were slow, resulting in only a slight increase.

Yesterday's cigarette market saw scattered retail sales at the opening, but then Hua Cheng Company released goods, leading to sales by other businesses. As a result, a carton of 10-pack British American Tobacco cigarettes dropped by 500,000, while Old Knife cigarettes rose by 300,000. High-end Great Southern and No. 3 Cannon cigarettes remained strong due to brisk actual sales.

The daily necessities soap market was active due to restocking, with brands like Gu Ben Jie Dao and Xiang Mao rising by 30,000 to 40,000 per case, while Guanghua, Meili, and Henry remained stable.

Matches sold well, with old brands like Phoenix and Meili rising by 100,000 to 200,000 per case. Prices of various miscellaneous brands fluctuated, while foreign candles were popular, selling for 2.3 million per case. Kerosene prices were flat.

### Chinese Stock Buying Spree Initiated - Yong'an Cotton Mill Shares Reach New Market Price

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were heavily purchased by the Guangdong contingent, with Yong'an Cotton Mill shares reaching a new high of 2325 yuan. Other stocks also generally rose. China Flour Mill and Tongyi Yarn Factory both reached their daily limit, especially the former, which had a severe shortage of supply. Hong Kong Electric and foreign capital stimulated buying, ushering in a new phase.

Early morning sentiment was stable due to various buying factors. Yong'an Cotton Mill shares were listed at 2180 yuan, and China Flour Mill opened at the daily limit. Meiya new shares were slightly better than before the capital increase. After opening, they rose to 2200 yuan, then were sold down to a low of 2168 yuan, before rising again to 2223 yuan. Agency fees opened high at 20 yuan and 23 yuan, with strong buying interest from the Guangdong contingent. Foreign shares were also popular, rising to 2255 yuan. The noon close was 2230 yuan. China Flour Mill stood firm at the daily limit. Compared to last Saturday, Tongyi and Guohuo rose by 10%, while Huaxin, Hengfeng, Jinglun, and Lian'an rose by over 5%. Zhabei was stable, while others saw slight gains.

In the afternoon, the Hong Kong exchange rate shrank again, opening at 2265 yuan. It initially rose to 2300 yuan, then was sold to 2275 yuan, before finally being bought up to a new high of 2325 yuan. National Bank was lackluster. Although Tongyi was listed at the daily limit of 175, Yong'an Cotton Mill still retreated to 2295 yuan, closing at 2300 yuan. Meiya shares strengthened with support from the 13th and 183rd numbers, recovering significantly. Compared to the morning close, Meiya, Huaxin, Xinhe, Jinglun, Lian'an, Matches, China Silk, and New Zhabei rose by over 5%, while others saw slight gains. Unlisted stocks outside the concession generally rose by about 5%.

Government bonds rebounded slightly yesterday. United Grade C bonds opened at 154,000 in the morning, rising to 163,000 before settling slightly. About 5 million changed hands. Compared to last Saturday, Grade A and B rose slightly by 1,000 yuan, Grade C and E rose by 6,000 yuan, and United Grade D rose by 3,000 yuan.

Yesterday, foreign shares saw hot stocks reach their peak and stop rising, and speculative funds shifted their attention to rubber stocks, causing a shift in buying. Rubber stocks opened at 3.93 million in the morning, falling to 3.84 million, and finally returned to the morning opening price and hovered. Money exchange businesses and retail investors sold off, while securities businesses and the Guangdong contingent bought in. The contraction of Hong Kong Electric stock continued, but the overall situation was still positive. Compared to last Saturday, rubber stocks, steel, shipping, and Jardine Matheson each rose by over 5%, while others saw slight gains.

### Hong Kong Gold and Exchange Rates

[Report from our Hong Kong Bureau, 3rd] Gold 332, US Dollar 5.55, National Currency 75, Shanghai Telegram 675.

### Cotton Yarn Factories and Merchants Must Ship Cotton Stored Outside the City Before the 10th of This Month

[United Credit Reporting Agency] Regarding the procedures for issuing cotton transportation permits for the shipment and transit of cotton stored outside the city, the Cotton Yarn Control Committee previously, based on requests from various yarn factories and cotton merchants to handle matters flexibly, stipulated that transportation permits would be issued for cotton imported before February 27th of this year that could provide supporting documents. It is now learned that the Cotton Yarn Control Committee's above measures are to show consideration for the merchants' difficulties and are a temporary expedient. Now, in order to expedite transportation and prevent issues from arising over time, it is specifically stipulated that the original measures should have a deadline of May 10th of this year. All cotton stored outside the city by various yarn factories and cotton merchants that has not yet been shipped must be completely loaded and shipped before the 10th of this month, or sold to the committee at the prescribed price, and entrusted to the cotton collection agency for purchase at the price. After the deadline, no exceptions will be made regardless of whether supporting documents can be provided. Notices have been issued to local offices and related trade associations to inform all manufacturers.

### Directors of Gold Control Bureau Arrive in the Capital Together

[Report from our Nanjing Bureau, 3rd] Li Lixia, Director of the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau, Lin Chongyong, Director of the Hankou Gold Control Bureau, and Gao Fang, Director of the Guangzhou Gold Control Bureau, arrived in Nanjing together from Shanghai on the morning of the 3rd. They immediately went to the Ministry of Finance to pay their respects to Minister Yu and Zai Mingli, Director of the Currency Department, to report on their work. It is heard that Li and others have come to make recommendations to the Ministry of Finance regarding financial management matters, and they have exchanged views separately in Shanghai. Yu Hongjun, Xu Baiyuan, and others all attended the Kuomintang representatives' political, economic, military, and party affairs review meeting on the 3rd, so they were unable to discuss in detail with them. A meeting of the directors of the various Gold Control Bureaus will be convened within the next day or two to discuss improvements to future gold control work.

### Domestic Tea Market Quite Active

Yesterday, the tea market saw export merchants' appetites remain mediocre, but cargo owners, feeling that new tea had not yet been harvested and that old tea inventories were sparse, maintained a defensive attitude, and the market remained characterized by limited buying and selling. Transactions were few, and the trend was stable. As for domestic sales, except for Tianjin's demand, which remained weak, sales in other regions continued as before. In particular, local demand for Qimen scented tea and tea dust was strong, unprecedented. Prices were consistently firm. However, new products for this year showed signs of weakness, with multiple drops in price. Furthermore, new Wenzhou red and yellow teas ultimately could not sustain the price and rapidly declined.

### Sugar Tightness Remains Unabated

Yesterday, the sugar market saw the price of rationed sugar increase by 800,000, so the trend was tight, and prices continued to rise. The association's quoted prices for spot goods rose by 3% for Grade 2 coarse white sugar, slightly less than 3% for Grade 4 semi-white sugar, and 5% for Grade 20 medium granulated white sugar, with warehouse warrants fluctuating by 100,000. Immediate delivery for the 18th period of coarse white sugar initially rose by 220,000, then fell back by slightly under 70,000, before rising again by 30,000. Immediate delivery for today initially rose by 50,000, then rose again by 80,000 to 90,000.

Domestic sugar saw prices become tight due to a lack of support from production costs. As green sugar was still relatively cheap compared to Taiwanese goods, the increase was not lagging behind. Shantou granulated sugar rose again by 200,000 to 300,000, Diaozhou green sugar rose by 15%, Xinghua white sugar rose by slightly less than 300,000, Xinghua red sugar rose by 100,000 to 200,000, and Hainan red sugar rose by about 10%.

### Can Probability Replace Truth?

— Hong Qian

(1) Theoretical Basis for Probability Replacing Truth

Since modern physics has extensively applied the concept of probability, new questions have arisen in philosophy regarding the issue of truth. These new questions concerning truth do not involve metaphysical speculation about the existence or non-existence of truth, but rather whether we can use the concept of probability to replace the concept of truth, and whether we can use "high probability" and "low probability" to express the truthfulness of actual things. The German philosopher H. Reichenbach (hereinafter referred to as R) stated affirmatively: What we call truth is, in fact, all probability, and what we call error is also all probability. "High probability" is the truth of something, and "low probability" is the error of something. The term truth is a redundant concept in logic. Only probability can be considered the fundamental concept and theoretical basis of human knowledge.

R's concept of truth is representative of the views of some contemporary scientists. The main reason they deny truth as the fundamental concept of human knowledge and propose replacing it with the concept of probability is that modern physics has abandoned the principle of causality as a standard for scientific knowledge, and has applied so-called statistical laws to establish the theoretical basis of modern science. R and others believe that so-called absolute truth in philosophy, while having its wonderful metaphysical theories, can only be explained in science by the principle of causality serving as the theoretical foundation of classical science and having its actual universality. Now that the principle of causality has become invalid due to the establishment of modern physics, then such a concept of truth should naturally change accordingly.

(2) Statistical Laws Are Not Mathematical "Probability Laws"

R's view of truth seems to have its reasons and basis on the surface, but it is actually completely wrong. The reasons for their errors can be attributed, first, to their lack of precise understanding of the essence of statistical laws and "probability laws"; and second, to their lack of full understanding of the logical meaning of probabilistic propositions and actual true/false propositions. This is why they believe that statistical laws can eliminate causality and that probabilistic propositions can replace true/false propositions.

We believe that R's mistake regarding the first point stems from the fact that statistical laws are not, in fact, a mathematical "probability law" as R claims, but rather a kind of "imprecise causal law." This point will become clear if we analyze the differences between causal laws and statistical laws. Regarding the differences between causal laws and statistical laws, we can say in principle that the former describes and infers individual relationships between certain actual events, while the latter can only describe and infer collective relationships between certain actual events. For example, we can infer from the pressure exerted on an object to the resistance it should generate, and we can infer from the certain temperature of water to its boiling point. These are all physical phenomena governed by causal laws. However, physical phenomena governed by statistical laws are not like this. Such physical phenomena, for example, using Maxwell's theory, which first applied statistical laws: we can describe the collective activity of molecules using precise causal laws, but the distribution state of molecules within a certain collective of molecules cannot be bound by laws. Similarly, in Schroedinger's quantum mechanics, the radiation part of waves is still governed by collective causal relationships, but the activity of protons and quanta within the collective of wave radiation is completely accidental and chaotic. Therefore, some scientists call causal laws natural laws with "precise causal laws," while statistical laws are natural laws with "imprecise causal laws."

However, if we agree with R's claim and do not view statistical laws as a kind of "imprecise causal law" but as a mathematical "probability law," then the possibility of statistical laws being natural laws is denied. We do not need to discuss the practical application of the concept of probability here. What we must explain is that statistical laws, as a kind of law about reality, are because they also have points that can become laws (such as the collective activity of molecules in Maxwell's theory), and are not established based on purely probabilistic components (such as the molecular distribution state within the collective of molecules in the above theory). Establishing a so-called "probability law" from purely probabilistic components may not be a problem in mathematics, but it is not possible in reality. For example, let us use ABCD to represent several actual events. Based on multiple and repeated observations, we cannot find their individual mutual causal relationships, nor can we prove their collective laws from a certain percentage. In such a situation, we can only say that the occurrence of these events is neither subject to causal laws nor statistical laws, but is completely without laws, and is accidental and chaotic.

However, from a mathematical perspective, the situation is fundamentally different for such accidental ABCD events that are not governed by any law (for example, using dice throwing as a metaphor). In mathematics, probability mathematics tells us that no matter how lawless and accidental an event is, we can still find a way to explain it using so-called "probability laws." We only need to arrange the multiple and repeated observation results obtained from ABCD events into rows and columns using mathematical permutation methods, and then average to determine their "relative frequency" within the entire amount, and then assume the application rules of this "relative frequency" from them. Naturally, the entire amount we propose here is always smaller than the total number of observations imagined. This point is assumed in mathematics using the term Limse, which expresses "the total number of observations grows beyond all limits."

From the above two explanations, we think it should be clear that "probability laws" are possible in mathematics and impossible in reality. In mathematics, we can explain purely accidental events in the form of laws. This is the task and function of "probability laws," and this is the object and purpose of probability mathematics. However, in reality, we can only have two statements about actual events: one is called lawful, which is subject to certain natural laws; and the other is called accidental, which is not subject to any natural laws. We cannot call lawful events accidental, can we? We cannot call accidental events lawful, can we? R and others did not see this point, so they advocated the identity of statistical laws and mathematical "probability laws," not knowing that this is not allowed by fact and is not allowed by logic.

### Talking About Synesthesia

— Hao Ran

There are some phenomena in the world that seem very strange at first, but after thinking about them carefully, they become ordinary. Synesthesia is one example.

Synesthesia refers to a situation where one sense has the properties of a completely different sense. For example, some perfectly normal people often hear that tones have colors. Low tones seem dark blue, and high tones seem bright red. Some people even have different color perceptions for each consonant and vowel. Each word seems like a picture. Months may also have different colors. Although colored hearing is the most common, other senses also have the possibility of synesthesia.

In 1669, a famous Danish anatomist, T. Bastholinus, discovered a deaf person who could hear more clearly in sunlight. Even a candle light seemed to help his hearing. The American psychology master James, in his great work "Principles of Psychology," quoted an example encountered by Urbantsclutsch: a visually impaired patient, when colors were too far away to see clearly, if he placed a tuning fork next to his ear, he could see immediately. Recently, a Russian biophysicist, Lazareff, publicly performed a demonstration in which he stepped on the piano pedal and then heavily struck the keys. Then, silently, he turned the lights on and off, and the audience heard the piano emit a fluctuating tone. Clearly, vision and hearing were influencing each other.

Laugfeld tested a person's color perception of musical scales twice, seven years apart, and the results were almost identical. This clearly shows that the matter is not accidental.

Tone Color perception (1905) Color perception (1912)

c Red Red

d Green Green

e Golden Sunshine

f Light Red Light Red

g Blue Blue

a Yellow Yellow

b Bronze Bronze

Darwin's cousin, F. Galton, did a lot of research on synesthesia. He encountered a person who had different color perceptions for each number: 1 was black, 2 was yellow, 3 was brick red, 4 was brownish yellow, 5 was blackish gray, 6 was ocher yellow, 7 was green, 8 was light blue, and 9 was ocher yellow. In addition, numbers and letters may also have different spatial forms, as shown in the figure below:

The above phenomena may seem bizarre, but they are not exceptions. If we want to arrange the north-facing room to be warmer, we will add red to it. If we find the bedroom too hot, we often use blue or violet to decorate it. This shows that we all recognize that color perception and temperature perception are related, although color perception belongs to the scope of vision, and temperature perception belongs to the scope of skin sensation.

We know that up and down belong to the scope of spatial perception, but no one can deny that non-spatial perceptions also have a sense of up and down. For example, for colors, light colors are on top and dark colors are on the bottom; the same is true for weight, light is on top and heavy is on the bottom; the same is true for tones, high frequencies are on top and low frequencies are on the bottom. Smell, taste, cold, and heat can also be divided into up and down. In short, perceptions are not isolated and unrelated. From the perspective of "holistic correlation," perceptions are not lacking in consistency or unity. All perceptions help each other and influence each other. For example, spatial perception depends not only on vision, but also on hearing, touch, and even kinesthetic sense. For example, eye movements, such as the convexity and concavity of the eyeballs, and the convergence of the two eyes, are important clues to spatial perception. We feel that lifting a pound of cotton is much lighter than lifting a pound of iron, which shows how weight is influenced by vision. We see that the rising moon is large, but the moon in the mid-sky is much smaller. This seems to be related to a person's posture. Looking straight ahead and looking up can affect a person's perception. Who has not seen snow white and felt cold, seen reptiles and felt slippery? From the unity of perception, we can not only explain general illusions and hallucinations, but also find a theoretical basis for general perception. In this sense, the synesthesia phenomenon is not only not strange, but also a good example of the consistency of perception.

### Research on "Man"

— Jing Guan

Since the birth of the atomic bomb, practical politicians and scientists have been thinking about how to control it, how to organize international institutions to deal with this murderous weapon, or how to use atomic energy to transform it from a destructive force into a constructive force. We cannot say that these works are not important. But there is even more important work that practical politicians seem to have neglected, and that is the research on "man." The atomic bomb itself is not scary, what is scary is man, the man who uses the atomic bomb, the man with the intention to kill. Without controlling "man" and without trying to eliminate "man"'s intention to kill, the control of the atomic bomb is futile. This point has been seen by Western scholars, so in recent years, research on "man" has been particularly lively. Famous philosophers, such as John Dewey, have a book "Problems of Men," and Cassirer has a book "An Essay on Man." Recently, a group of people in Chicago, USA, discovered from the index of 432 famous books that 51 of the 102 fundamental concepts of Western culture are "man." This proves how much Western scholars pay attention to the problem of "man." In the past, when capitalism prevailed, man was regarded as "Economic Man." When Freud's psychology gained popularity, man was once again regarded as "Tsychological Man." Now, when the ideal of a global family is gradually rising, there are also those who regard man as "World Man." What exactly is "man"? We have uncovered so many secrets of nature, we have many methods to control nature, but have we discovered the secrets of man? Do we have methods to control man? Research on "man" should be the most important research, even more important than research on atomic energy.

### Bosanquet on the Imperfect Self

— Zhi Ru

Every person is a self. Every self may do bad things, have bad behavior. In other words, there are bad people in the world, which is a fact, not a fantasy. Why do people become bad? This is a very difficult question to answer. Simply put, Bosanquet believes that the reason why people are evil is because we are confined to our limited selves, unable to break through the barriers of our limited selves and become one with heaven and earth, or unite with the absolute. Therefore, our finiteness, and the weakness and powerlessness that arise from this finiteness, can be said to be the root of all evil. But our finiteness is not fixed and immutable; it can be transcended. Because on the one hand, we are finite, and on the other hand, we are also infinite. To put it more clearly, as individual and distinct entities, we are finite; but each of us has an inseparable inner relationship with the universe we are in, and our finiteness is precisely shown by our infiniteness. Therefore, as we communicate with all things and become one, we are infinite. We know that the pursuit of truth and the achievement of morality can expand our self to communicate with external things, to break through our limited shackles, and to unite with the whole. This process from finite to infinite, from individual to the whole, is a process of becoming virtuous and achieving goodness; if we go against this, that is, confined to the self and obstructing communication with others, acting perversely and contrary, we will drift into evil. Bosanquet uses this principle as a standard, and divides the imperfect self into three levels.

(1) The self of animals, that is, the self that lives unconsciously with physical desires without rational awareness. The imperfection of this self is very obvious, but physical needs and desires can make us evil, and can also make us good. In itself, it has no good or evil to speak of. This self is a self without principles, not even qualifying as a human self. His life is like the material of an article, without structure and without contradictions; only in this situation can we not regard it as evil and deny it. (To be continued)

### Academic Miscellany (12)

— Zhang Qiyun

The humanism advocated by Irving Babbitt is different from humanitarianism and is sharply opposed to romanticism or sentimentalism. It is also very different from naturalism. The difference between humanism and humanitarianism lies in the fact that humanitarianism is an indiscriminate compassion, while humanism is differential, that is, it has degrees of intimacy and estrangement according to the depth of relationships. It can also be called the selection of compassion. One is universal love, and the other is love with measure and distinction. The two are completely different, just like the division between the Confucian and Mohist schools in ancient China. Romanticism originated from Rousseau in France (1712-1778), emphasizing emotion and tending to extremes, using emotion to measure everything, so it is also called sentimentalism. Rousseau did not focus on inner cultivation but wanted to exhaust his energy to advance the progress of the people as his duty. Humanism is different from this, starting from one's own cultivation, taking learning, deep thinking, advancing in virtue, and cultivating one's career as the key, "working inward." Romantics dedicate themselves to the masses or a class, and their disadvantage is that they value the external over the internal. Humanism emphasizes the order of priorities and the importance of deep thinking, seeking harmony between reason and emotion, and striving for completeness in personality. Babbitt believed that life is a comedy for those with clear thinking and a tragedy for those who are emotional. From the second half of the eighteenth century to the present, Western literature, art, education, philosophy, religion, and even politics have been directly and indirectly influenced by the romantic movement. This school's emotional impulses reach a state of frenzy, and the result is often destruction without construction, causing the disintegration of a healthy personality. The advocacy of humanism is to correct the abuses of romanticism. The ideal of humanism is the demeanor of a gentleman. A gentleman has three strengths: mediocrity, sensitivity, and rationality. Mediocrity means self-restraint, moderation, avoiding extremes, integrating all extremes, and grasping the center, so it can tend to the middle path, neither radical nor following blindly. Happiness and dignity both come from being able to control oneself. The opposite of sensitivity is numbness, but it is not about being curious and seeking novelty. The mind is open, able to observe all aspects of a problem, and make careful judgments. Its strength lies in the depth of thought and the excellence of insight. Rationality means conforming to standards. Where should the standards be sought? They should be sought in the great works of great thinkers of the past. The great concepts elucidated in the great works of the past exist beyond time and space. True knowledge and insight are mostly timeless and can serve as a guide for our actions. Therefore, the meaning of rationality is the promotion of ideas and the liberation of the spirit, allowing the mind to gain freedom and not be blinded by momentary impulses. The highest state is to follow one's heart's desires without transgressing the rules. Sensitivity is equivalent to the Chinese character "仁" (benevolence), and rationality is equivalent to the Chinese character "禮" (ritual). Speaking of benevolence, ritual, and mediocrity, using these three to explain the virtue and conduct of a gentleman is closest to Chinese Confucianism. In opposition to humanism, there is also naturalism. This school was influenced by Darwin's theory and flourished in the second half of the nineteenth century (the Victorian era in England). The development of American mechanical civilization and mass production is even greater than in other countries, so most people are dazzled by material prosperity, fascinated by the power of science, and inevitably indifferent to higher cultural values. Romanticism emphasizes emotional function, and naturalism emphasizes mechanical function. Taking them too far is a common disease of modern culture. Babbitt believed that the World War was a natural result of bad ideas since the nineteenth century. Humanism is aimed at this kind of shortcoming and seeks to remedy it. Humanists are incompatible with romanticism but retain their interest in art. The appreciation of natural beauty, such as the natural beauty of mountains and rivers, is very beneficial to humanistic cultivation. Humanists cannot agree with naturalism, but they do not want to abandon the high efficiency of material civilization altogether. In short, the main purpose of humanism is the art of living, striving to achieve a perfect and beautiful state of life in this world. Furthermore, humanists are aware of the scope of their efforts and do not want to encompass everything. Babbitt believed that those who want to encompass everything will end up with nothing. Humanistic efforts are for human affairs. Things below human affairs are governed by the laws of nature, and things above human affairs belong to the realm of religion. Humanism cannot replace science, nor can it replace religion. Humanism has existed since the European Renaissance, but modern humanists must understand the methods and spirit of science and keep up with the times, so it is also called scientific neo-humanism. Babbitt also liked to quote the words of the Englishman Edmund Burke, saying that Western culture is based on two principles: the spirit of religion and the spirit of a gentleman. Humanism is the expression of the spirit of a gentleman.
