### Election Method for Legislative Yuan President Voted on; First Ballot Prints the Names of All Legislators; The Size of the Ballot Will Be the Largest in the World

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The Legislative Yuan will hold the sixth preparatory meeting on the morning of the 17th for the mutual election of the President and Vice President of the Yuan. Wu Tiecheng submitted a report at the fifth preparatory meeting on the afternoon of the 15th and solicited the opinions of the committee members. Some people in the meeting advocated that the mutual election should be postponed since the rules of procedure had not yet been established. Jiang Yiping said that the President and Vice President would be inaugurated on the 20th, and in order to promote the administrative work as soon as possible, the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan should be mutually elected as scheduled on the 17th, which was passed by the whole venue without objection. Whether the rules of procedure can be passed before the 17th will not affect the mutual election.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The method for the mutual election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan was all passed at the fourth preparatory meeting on the 15th. The Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan is currently rushing to print the ballots. It is reported that according to the mutual election method, the first ballot should list the names of all 773 legislators. The names of the legislators are printed in No. 4 lead type. The size of the ballot will be the largest of any ballot in the world. Its size is smaller than two opened newspaper sheets but larger than four opened newspaper sheets.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The method for voting and counting votes for the mutual election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan was also smoothly passed at the fifth preparatory meeting on the afternoon of the 15th, with only minor revisions in the text. The fifth meeting was held at 3:30 PM, attended by 174 members, with Wu Tiecheng as chairman. The voting and counting methods were discussed item by item. Only the "four" boxes in the third clause were changed to "eight." Kong Geng advocated changing Article 5, which stipulates that ballots should be received with the certificate of election, to receiving ballots with the certificate of attendance, but this was rejected. All other items were passed without objection, and the meeting was adjourned in only forty minutes. The supervisors for voting and counting were also nominated by each unit after the meeting.

### Discussion Situation of the Fourth Preparatory Meeting

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The method for the mutual election of the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan was passed by the fourth preparatory meeting on the morning of the 15th after four days of discussion. During the discussion on the morning of the 15th, the members put forward many revised opinions on the draft, but as a result of the vote, only two amendments were made to the original text. The fourth preparatory meeting was still chaired by Wu Tiecheng, who announced the discussion of the mutual election method. The majority of the members advocated passing the discussion and voting item by item, and there was no objection. Hu Shuhua, convener of the Drafting Committee, explained the main points of the amendment adding the re-election clause, and then began to discuss item by item. When discussing the title, Li Boshen, Chen Dacheng, Chen Guyuan, Zou Shuwen, Guo Tianyi, Zhang Ziyang and others put forward their opinions, some advocated changing the method to rules, and some advocated changing the mutual election method to the mutual election and re-election method, but after the vote, it was still passed according to the original title. During the discussion of the clauses, fierce debates unfolded on Articles 2, 4, 5, and 8. Article 2 stipulates that the election must be held with the attendance of more than one-fifth of the total number of legislators. Wu Shangying pointed out that there were no "more than" words in the Legislative Yuan Organization Law and should be deleted, and this amendment was passed. Zhang Huiwen advocated that more than one-half of those present should be present, and Zhao Xianyi advocated more than one-third, but their opinions were rejected. Articles 4 and 5 stipulate that the first ballot lists the names of all members, and the second ballot lists the top two names with the most votes in the first election. The first election must obtain more than half of the votes to be elected, and the second election will be elected by the person with the most votes. Articles 4 and 5 were discussed together. Yang Buping, Liu Xianyun, Miao Qiping, Huang Su Fang and others advocated that the second ballot should still list the names of all members to conform to the purpose of mutual election. Some people also believed that listing only two names in the second election was a disguised nomination. Xu Pan Yun said that printing 773 people on the ballot was not only indefinitely large, but also some units were left blank because they were not elected, which was inappropriate. He suggested writing the votes separately and attaching the list of all members outside the ballot. The technical difficulties of the frontier members will be solved separately, but these amendments were rejected and passed according to the original plan. Article 8 stipulates the re-election method, which was the most contentious. It was originally stipulated that the re-election could be carried out with the proposal of more than one-fifth of the total number of members and the approval of more than half of the members present. Some members believed that the number of proposers was too large. Qiu Changwei took the lead and said that in order to maintain a consistent spirit, only 30 people need to propose. Zhu Huiqing, Liu Shidu and others advocated detailed regulations on the circumstances under which re-election should be carried out. Wu Shipeng and Tian Yushi advocated that re-election should be at least six months after the election. Huang Zhezhen advocated that there should be no two re-elections in the same session. Opinions were divided and debated repeatedly. Finally, after the chairman summarized the opinions of the members, he voted one by one and only passed the proposal to modify the proposal of more than one-fifth to more than one-tenth. The rest were rejected. In addition to the above four articles, the remaining five articles were passed without objection. The mutual election method was thus fully passed, and the meeting adjourned at 12:50.

### Draft Rules of Procedure of the Legislative Yuan Submitted to the Preparatory Meeting for Decision; The Work of the Drafting Committee Comes to an End After Fierce Debate

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The Drafting Committee of the Legislative Yuan's Rules of Procedure held its fourth meeting at 8:45 PM on the 15th. The convener Lei Yin chaired the meeting. First, Chen Guyuan, convener of the 13-member group, reported on the group's meeting at 3 PM, which lasted for three and a half hours, to study the results of the re-examination and revision of the various matters delivered by the Drafting Committee's three meetings, and then discussed them again accordingly. Regarding the three readings in Chapter 5 "Readings," since the bills passed by the second reading will never be rejected again unless there are too few members present at the third reading, the method of enabling members to attend the third reading as much as possible to participate in the vote is still used to remedy this, so an additional article was added: "The third reading shall be conducted on the day after the second reading or at a meeting, but the chairman may conduct it on the same day as the second reading after consulting the members present." The provisions on questioning in Chapter 10 "Listening to Reports and Questioning" were revised as "The submission of questions is limited to stating the gist of the questions, and the answers to the questions shall not exceed the scope of the questions. The aforementioned questions shall not be used as a topic for discussion." In Chapter 12 "Order," the clause "Members who leave the meeting first do not affect the calculation of the quorum" was amended by adding the words "meeting" before "quorum," and an article was added to Chapter 7 "Voting" to limit the submission of proposals for voting when it is discovered during the meeting that the number of members present is less than the quorum. Finally, during the discussion of Chapter 8 "Exercise of Consent Rights," the scene of repeated debates in the second and third meetings and the 13-member group was repeated again. As a result, the revised text proposed by the group and other deletions and revisions were not passed. It was decided not to hold another meeting for discussion and to submit the four different opinions to the preparatory meeting of the whole Yuan for decision. (1) The proposed amendment A is a composite of the opinions of all parties in the meeting held yesterday, consisting of four articles: (1) "When exercising the same right under Article 55 of the Constitution, it shall be reviewed by the Committee of the Whole Yuan and then submitted to the meeting of the Yuan for voting. The Committee of the Whole Yuan mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall elect one person from the members to be the chairman."; (2) "If the Committee of the Whole Yuan deems it necessary, it may request the President to notify the nominee to submit his opinions on administration and personnel."; (3) "When exercising the right of consent under Article 104 of the Constitution, the provisions of Article 52 shall apply." (Note: Article 52 is (1)(4) "The decision to exercise the right of consent shall be made by secret ballot."). (2) Proposed amendment B is proposed by Chen Haicheng and others to delete the three words "and personnel" at the end of (2) of amendment A. (3) Proposed amendment C is proposed by Chen Guyuan and others to delete the entire article (2) of amendment A. (4) Proposed amendment D is proposed by Chen Bosheng and others to delete all articles (1), (2), and (3) of amendment A and replace them with "When the President submits a candidate to the Yuan in accordance with the provisions of Articles 55 and 104 of the Constitution, the President of the Yuan shall directly submit it to the meeting of the Yuan for a vote." Article (4) of amendment A shall still be retained. The debate on the "Exercise of Consent Rights" has been debated fiercely for three days, but no result has been achieved. However, after Bao Huaguo and Du Guangxun explained the spirit of the Constitution, no one now believes in the "Yuan Xian" theory that they should first learn about the administrative and personnel opinions of the candidate for President of the Executive Yuan when exercising the right of consent before submitting it. This issue will inevitably cause more intense disputes when it is submitted to the preparatory meeting. As for Ye Suochong's repeated proposal to include the two parts of the organization of the Committee for the Review of Member Qualifications and the election method of the President and Vice President of the Yuan in the rules, it is generally believed that it is not necessary to include them in the rules as they can be stipulated separately. The meeting ended at 10:45 PM. The work of the Rules of Procedure Drafting Committee came to an end after four days of earnest discussion.

### Sun Ke Attends the Preparatory Meeting of the Legislative Yuan for the First Time

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] Sun Ke attended the preparatory meeting of the Legislative Yuan for the first time on the morning of the 15th and sat in seat number 987 after the member seats, reading the Worldgram magazine and English newspapers he brought with him. He did not seem to pay much attention to the discussion of the method for the mutual election of the President and Vice President of the Yuan, and continued reading without interruption. Sun stepped out of the venue slowly when the meeting paused at 11:30.

### Soviet Foreign Ministry Suddenly Approves Transit Visas for US Consulate Staff to Dalian; Plan to Charter a Merchant Ship to Sail to Dalian Temporarily Canceled

[US Information Service, This City] The US State Department originally intended to charter a merchant ship to sail directly to Dalian once to transport the US Consulate staff and supplies to Dalian. However, this morning, hours before the ship was scheduled to depart, it suddenly received formal notification from the Soviet Foreign Ministry in Moscow approving visas for all US Consulate staff to pass through Vladivostok and then travel from Vladivostok to their destination. As a result, the plan to charter a merchant ship to sail directly to Dalian has been canceled. Consul Brock and Vice Consul Creston have been waiting in Shanghai for Soviet approval of their visas and transportation to go to Vladivostok and then to Dalian for months. After a long period of delay and still failing to obtain the necessary Soviet visas and travel rights, the State Department approved chartering a ship to sail to Dalian to transport US Consulate staff and sufficient supplies needed by the local consulate and to carry Vice Consul Barker and his family back. For this reason, special permission was obtained from the Chinese government to allow the Everett Lines' Coastal Winner to sail to Dalian once. The ship, which originally operated regularly between Korea and Shanghai, was scheduled to sail to Dalian yesterday, and was originally scheduled to depart today.

### The Problem of National Education Funding

— Qiu

When the highest education authority attended the National Assembly on April 14th to report on the education situation, it declared that the Ministry of Education intends to fully promote national education in the future. Therefore, 800 billion was included in the central education budget for basic education subsidies this year. At the same time, the Executive Yuan passed the measures for consolidating and increasing national education funds, such as including national school expenses in the special budgets below the county level, holding "study grain" donations, launching temporary donations, and consolidating school funds and school properties. This shows that the government has decided to broaden national education funding to promote the basic education needed by the masses. "Our country's new education has always been an education that goes against the interests of the masses. It is an education that makes people pay money and give their children to become officials, and the children of the rich, after graduation, go back to exploit the poor and the children of the poor." In the past ten years, this anti-democratic situation has become doubly serious. The higher and secondary education exclusively enjoyed by a small number of children of the rich has shown unprecedented expansion, but the national education needed by the vast majority of taxpayers' children has shrunk to a pitiful level. From the perspective of social justice, this is extremely unfair. Therefore, the government's policy of popularizing compulsory education and broadening national education funding is worthy of support. However, the failures of the past few compulsory education popularization movements have been due to having plans without funds or having funds without proper management. Having plans without funds means the plans are just empty words; having funds without proper management means the funds are mostly embezzled by unscrupulous officials. Therefore, how to increase financial resources and how to properly manage them are two important issues in national education funding.

In the past, the methods for broadening national education funding have been piecemeal. In the future, unified and effective strategies for increasing financial resources should be adopted. First, we hope that the government will implement Article 164 of the Constitution, which stipulates that "the expenditure on education, science, and culture shall not be less than 15% of the total budget at the central level, not less than 25% at the provincial level, and not less than 35% at the county and city level." As long as this article can be implemented, the total education budget at the central and local levels will increase significantly, and national education funding will also increase accordingly. Second, we hope that the government will stipulate the proportion of national education funding in the central and local education budgets. According to the 1934 US education funding statistics, out of every 17 cents of education funding, 12 cents are used for primary school education, 3 cents are used for secondary school education, and 2 cents are used for university education. In other words, national education funding accounts for 70% of the total education budget in the United States, which is a quite reasonable ratio. Based on this standard, our country can tentatively make the following provisions: the central government's subsidies to various provinces shall not be less than 30% of their total education budget, the provinces' subsidies to various counties shall not be less than 40% of their total education budget, the counties' and cities' subsidies to various townships shall not be less than 50% of their total education budget, and the townships' subsidies shall not be less than 90% of their total education budget. Third, we hope that the government will follow the French method of paying teachers' salaries and stipulate the proportion of primary school teachers' salaries to be borne by governments at all levels. The salary of each primary school teacher can be subsidized by one-tenth by the central government, two-tenths by the province, three-tenths by the county, and four-tenths by the townships, all adjusted at any time according to the price index. Finally, the methods prescribed by the Executive Yuan, such as holding "study grain" donations, launching voluntary donations, and consolidating school properties, can also be adopted, but the most fundamental method is to hold education tax, which is stipulated by the Education Council and collected independently.

Now that the source of national education funding is abundant, the next question is how to manage it. The purpose of management, in a negative sense, is to prevent corruption and embezzlement; in a positive sense, it is to guide proper use. In the past, almost all the national education subsidies from the central government and various provinces were embezzled by unscrupulous officials. Provincial education administrators often diverted most of these subsidies to other purposes, such as compiling and printing textbooks, opening bookstores, purchasing machines, and experimenting with new teaching methods, or even using them to engage in commerce. There are many other ways to seek profit, too numerous to mention. However, the biggest drawback is the inflated number of national schools, because provinces and counties can use this to receive more national education subsidies from the higher-level government. For example, a certain province in Southeast China reported having more than 20,000 "Bao Xue" ten years ago, but according to experts' estimates, the actual number of "Bao Xue" currently is less than three-tenths of the reported number. A few years ago, when the author inspected the administration of a certain county in that province, the county government submitted a thick booklet of national school forms. The "Model Township" table contained the names, addresses, school land area, names, qualifications, and salaries of the principals and teachers of fifteen national schools, the number of male and female students in the children's classes, the number of male and female students in the adult classes, and the amount of various expenses, etc., everything was available. However, the actual investigation revealed that the "Model Township" only had one national school. The names of the other fourteen schools, the names of the principals and teachers, the number of students, and the various expenses were all fabricated, but the expenses that these schools should have received each month had been claimed without error by the county government using many fake seals. The author, with limited experience, reported the truth at a meeting and requested that the county magistrate be given a reprimand, but everyone believed that the situation was the same in all counties, and it seemed unfair to only punish the county magistrate, so the author suddenly realized and remained silent. In fact, all crows in China are black, and a certain province is no exception. In the past ten years, after the central government and provincial national education subsidies were exploited layer by layer, the amount that could flow into the hands of national school teachers was very little. As for the national education funding of townships and "Bao", it was mostly controlled by local tyrants, and their tricks were no less than those of the county magistrates.

The effective way to prevent embezzlement and guide proper use is of course the democratization of education administration. From the perspective of education economics, the so-called democratization of education administration is to allow the people to participate in the collection, management, and distribution of education funds, so that the money spent by the masses can produce the greatest efficiency in running education that seeks the happiness of the masses. In order to realize this ideal, the Chinese Education Society has suggested that the government establish education councils at all levels, organized by a certain number of leaders from all walks of life and education experts elected by the people. Their powers related to education funding are to determine education policies, review education budgets, stipulate education tax rates, collect education taxes, manage special education funds, review final accounts, accept complaints, impeach or dismiss education officials, etc. The establishment of provincial and county education councils can prevent the embezzlement and waste of national education funding, because the national education subsidies and other special funds from all levels of government are received, managed, and distributed to various units by the council. Money does not pass through the hands of education administrators, so they seem unable to commit fraud. Even if there is fraud, the council can discover the loopholes when reviewing the final accounts, and the people can also file complaints with the council, and unscrupulous officials will be punished. The establishment of education councils can not only prevent embezzlement but also indicate proper uses. Because it has determined the uses of national education funding when deciding education policies and reviewing education budgets. If it is difficult to establish education councils temporarily, an education funding management committee can be set up in the provincial and county councils, organized by a certain number of council members, social dignitaries, and education experts elected by the council. National education subsidies can be managed and distributed by the committee, and its income and expenditure can be announced at any time. Education committees can also be established in each "Bao", organized by a certain number of people elected by the people to manage the property and funding of national schools and publish their accounts monthly. Therefore, the democratization of education administration is the most effective way to manage national education funding. Only by increasing financial resources and managing them properly can the problem of national education funding be solved, and the plan to popularize national education can be realized.

### The US Continues to Purchase Siamese and Burmese Rice and Wheat for Shipment to China to Help Stabilize Our Grain Prices; Rationing of Grain in Cities Such as Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou Has Been Effective

[Report from our Nanjing office, 15th] According to the Ministry of Food: Regarding the US purchase of rice in Siam to provide relief to our country, according to the report of Liang Changpei, the representative of the Ministry stationed in Siam, as of March 25, the US had purchased a total of 27,800 tons of rice with a relief fund of US$5 million. It has now been shipped to be used for grain rationing in cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. In addition, the new aid-to-China bill includes a grain purchase fund of 85 million US dollars, but it is still in the discussion stage. The first phase of the US loan can be paid immediately, of which 16 million US dollars will be used for grain purchase, and 11.4 million US dollars will be designated for purchasing rice in Siam and Burma. According to the current market price, it is estimated that about 63,000 tons of Burmese rice can be purchased, and the remaining 4.6 million US dollars can purchase about 30,000 tons of foreign wheat. As for grain prices in various places, since the implementation of civil food rationing in cities such as Nanjing and Shanghai, they have gradually become stable. Recently, due to the sharp rise in general prices and the season of famine, grain prices have inevitably risen, but the rate of increase is still more moderate than general prices.

### Zhang Qun Replies to the Taiwan National Assembly Delegates Friendship Association; Talk of Replacing the Governor of Taiwan Province is Groundless; The Central Government's Reliance on Chairman Wei is Deep

[Report from our Taipei office, 15th] The Taiwan National Assembly Delegates Friendship Association, due to repeated rumors from the outside world that the governor of Taiwan Province would be replaced, sent a letter to the Executive Yuan suggesting that local leaders should not be easily replaced.

[Report from our Taipei office, 15th] The Taiwan National Assembly Delegates Friendship Association held a press conference today, reporting on their impressions of attending the National Assembly and the content of their proposals. Lin Zhong explained the content of the proposal to allow Taiwan Province to implement local autonomy in accordance with the Constitution first, saying that the proposal is attached with six measures: (1) Please ask the Legislative Yuan to formulate general rules for provincial and county autonomy before the end of June; (2) The central government designates Taiwan as a national autonomous demonstration zone; (3) Within two months after the promulgation of the general rules, convene a provincial people's congress to formulate provincial autonomy laws; (4) Within two months after the promulgation of the provincial autonomy laws, hold popular elections for county and city mayors; (5) After the popular election of more than half of the county and city mayors, hold a popular election for the provincial governor; (6) All mainlanders who have obtained citizenship and have a good reputation can be candidates for provincial and county mayors. Lin criticized the outside world for misinterpreting the autonomy demanded by Taiwan Province, saying: "Looking at the attached measures, one can understand that the autonomy eagerly hoped for by the Taiwanese compatriots is based on the Constitution." Subsequently, Yang Jinhu, Chen Fan, and others expressed their impressions, deeply admiring the magnificent buildings and commercial prosperity of the mainland, and praised the democratic style of the National Assembly, but also expressed surprise at the disparity between the rich and the poor in society. It is also learned that the Taiwan National Assembly delegates also proposed that the government recover the Ryukyu Islands and incorporate them into Taiwan Province.

### President Truman Announces Recognition of the New State of Israel; Still Willing to Strive for an Arab-Jewish Truce

[Our Dispatch] New York Broadcasting, 15th: Washington News, White House sources said that President Truman is considering, if necessary, lifting the arms embargo on Palestine and considering negotiating the establishment of diplomatic relations with the provisional government of the State of Israel. White House Press Secretary Ross told a press conference that the government's recognition of the Israeli provisional government has been met with very positive reactions from all parties.

[United Press Washington, 14th] President Truman formally announced today that the United States recognizes the Jewish State of Palestine de facto.

[Associated Press Washington, 14th] President Truman announced on the 14th that the United States recognizes the new Jewish state of Palestine. Minutes after the Jewish state in Palestine declared its establishment, which came into effect at 6:01 PM Eastern Daylight Time on the 14th, Truman issued a statement saying: "The U.S. government has been notified that a Jewish state has been proclaimed in Palestine and that the provisional government has requested recognition. The United States recognizes this provisional government as the de facto government of the new state of Israel." The US recognition comes at the time of the formal end of the British Mandate in Palestine. White House Press Secretary Ross said that the birth of the new Jewish state and the US recognition of it do not diminish US efforts to achieve an Arab-Jewish truce. "The United States' desire to facilitate a truce in Palestine is in no way diminished by the proclamation of a Jewish state. We hope that the new Jewish state will join the Armistice Commission of the Security Council in redoubling its efforts to bring an end to the war. The termination of the war is the main purpose of the United States throughout the entire stage of the United Nations' discussion of the Palestine issue." Truman's decision had been kept secret for two days. Lower-ranking personnel within the State Department were surprised by the statement. The general reaction was that the US had taken swift action ahead of the Soviet Union. Officials here had believed that the Soviet Union might be the first to recognize the "fact" when the British Mandate ended and the Jews declared a new independent state.

[Associated Press Washington, 14th] The White House's announcement of recognition of Israel has brought to a head a problem that has vexed President Truman since taking office. In recent months, this has been the cause of Truman's trouble with domestic and foreign policy in an election year. Today's recognition of the Jewish state is in effect recognition of the partition plan as a fait accompli. Truman's move clearly surprised many members of Congress.

[Reuters Washington, 15th] Relevant parties believe that the US government's recognition of the Jewish state of Israel is motivated by domestic political reasons. President Truman's move is intended to make up for the damage done to the Democratic Party's chances of winning this autumn's election after the Truman administration abandoned its support for the Palestine partition plan. New York State has millions of Jewish voters, and the recognition of Israel is intended to win the favor of these Jewish voters.

### Britain's Inconsistent Policy on the Holy Land Greatly Alarms the United Nations; Britain and France Do Not Intend to Recognize Israel at Present

[Associated Press Lake Success, 14th] The United Nations was in an uproar on the 14th, with rumors circulating that the US Chief Representative Austin intends to resign due to the White House's inconsistent policy on the Palestine issue. The surprising move by the United States has shocked both those who support and those who oppose the Jewish state.

When the news of the White House's recognition of the Jewish state reached him, Austin and the US representatives were also surprised. A spokesman admitted that the delegation had no prior knowledge of it. Diplomats from countries traditionally friendly to the United States, like the Soviet bloc, mocked the US delegation's ignorance. Some senior diplomats believe that Austin will react strongly and submit his resignation in protest.

[United Press New York, 14th] President Truman's sudden announcement of recognition of the Jewish state of Palestine has thrown the United Nations General Assembly into chaos. The meeting has effectively stalled. Many representatives rushed out of the hall upon hearing the news, initially saying that such a development was unbelievable. The Arab representatives were thunderstruck upon hearing the news and then looked worried.

[Associated Press Flushing, 14th] The United Nations General Assembly unexpectedly rejected on the 14th the US plan to establish a special United Nations administration in Palestine. The Arab and Soviet sides cast a total of 15 votes against the plan, and 18 abstained.

[United Press New York, 14th] The Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly adjourned today. The session, which opened on April 16th to discuss the Palestine issue, adjourned after four weeks without any results.

[United Press London, 14th] The British Foreign Office did not immediately comment on President Truman's sudden announcement of recognition of Israel, but a qualified government spokesman said that Britain would generally have to wait until the new state was able to govern before it could formally grant recognition. Moreover, Truman only announced de facto recognition, which is still far from de jure recognition. Only after de jure recognition can ambassadors be mutually appointed.

[Reuters Paris, 14th] A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that France does not intend to recognize the Jewish state until the French government is certain that the Jewish state has good intentions and has not crossed the borders designated by the United Nations Committee.

[Associated Press Lake Success, 14th] Guatemalan representative Granados announced that Guatemala formally recognizes the new Jewish state of Israel.

[Associated Press Stockholm, 14th] Political circles here hinted on the 14th that Sweden may follow the United States in recognizing Israel. President Truman's recognition of Israel has surprised the Swedish Foreign Ministry.

### Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Malik Leaves England for the United States

[Our Dispatch] London Broadcasting, 15th: Southampton News, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Malik departed for New York today on the "Queen Mary" liner. He refused to express any opinions to reporters.

### Jewish Cabinet Formed; Gurion Appointed Prime Minister and Minister of Defense

[Reuters Tel Aviv, 14th] The provisional government of the Jewish state of Israel has been formed. The Chairman of the Jewish National Council, 62-year-old Gurion, has been appointed Prime Minister and Minister of Defense. The head of the Political Department of the Jewish Agency, 54-year-old Sharettok, who was born in Russia and speaks seven languages, has been appointed Foreign Minister. The names of the other eleven cabinet members are as follows: Finance, Kaplan; Transportation, Remez; Trade, Industry, and Supply, Bernstein; Interior, Grunbaum; Immigration, Shapiro; Labor and Public Works, Bentov; Agriculture, Tsizling; Police, Shitreet; Justice, Rosenblueth; Ministers without Portfolio, Rabbi Fishman and Levin.

[United Press Tel Aviv, 14th] Jews announced the birth of the State of Israel tonight, realizing the Jewish dream of two thousand years. The new capital, Tel Aviv, is now under air raid alert. The Jewish Declaration of Independence was signed by all members of the Provisional Government Committee and was read by Prime Minister Gurion at 4:06 PM today. The independence ceremony lasted only one hour.

### Egyptian Troops Invade Palestine; Tel Aviv Under Air Attack; Jewish Troops Launch Large-Scale Offensive Along River in the Holy Land

[Associated Press Tel Aviv, 15th] As Arab armies launched a blitz attack from all sides on the newly established Jewish State of Israel, Egyptian army planes bombed Tel Aviv twice on the 15th. Jewish sources say that after the Jews occupied all the strongholds occupied by the Egyptian army, the Arabs and Jews began negotiations for a ceasefire in Palestine.

Egypt was the first to launch the offensive of the Arab countries, attempting to land 21 miles south of Tel Aviv, while also trying to break into Palestine at two points in the south. A few hours after midnight, large Syrian and Lebanese armies, traveling in 150 armored trucks, crossed the border from the north to fight.

Marshall, Churchill, and Vandenberg should also attend the meeting.

### More Hidden Communists Arrested; Most are Jiaotong University Graduates; Tao Long and Four Others Have Confessed; Mayor Reports on the Process During a Press Conference

[Our Dispatch] Mayor Wu held a press conference at the City Hall yesterday at 5 PM to report on the arrest of communists in the city, stating that in the past two months, 35 communists have surrendered to the security authorities. Most of them have lost confidence in the Communist Party, feel that there is no future, and their mentality has wavered, so they have surrendered one after another. The government's handling methods for communists hiding in the city are: (1) Encourage surrender and guarantee their path to reform. (2) If they remain unrepentant, they will be arrested and transferred to the Special Criminal Court in accordance with the Emergency Regulations for Harming the Republic of China During the Period of Suppressing the Rebellion. In the past few days, the security authorities have acted on this principle and arrested a hidden communist, Zhang Liangcai (female, 24 years old, from Wuxing, Jiaotong University graduate, currently a physics and chemistry teacher at Qiming Girls' High School). Based on her confession, five more people were subsequently arrested. Their names are Tao Long (male, 25 years old, from Shaoxing, Jiaotong University graduate, currently an intern engineer at China Agricultural Machinery Company), Tao Yao (male, 25 years old, from Wuxi, Jiaotong University graduate, intern engineer at China Agricultural Machinery Company), Liu Jiming (male, 26 years old, Jiaotong University graduate, intern at China Agricultural Machinery Company), Chen Yu (female, Jiaotong University graduate), and Cai Ying (female, not a Jiaotong University graduate).

### Jiaotong University Students Send Representatives to Inquire; Mayor Shows Confessions and Self-Incrimination Statements

They were told that this matter was unrelated to the students, and the government originally had no need to explain to the students and school authorities. However, to show the government's open attitude, the confessions and self-incrimination statements of Zhang Liangcai and others were shown to the three representatives. After reading them, the three representatives returned to inform the students that this matter had nothing to do with the current Jiaotong University students.

### Abstract of Confessions

The following are excerpts from the confessions of Zhang Liangcai, Tao Long, Tao Yao, Liu Jiming, and others: Tao Long confessed that he had been working in the company since November and December of the thirty-sixth year (of the Republic). Tao Yao asked me if I was willing to join the Communist Party. This was because we were both class representatives in school and often met during meetings. Our opinions were very unified. After graduation, we both took jobs at the company. He introduced me to a book called "A New Outlook on Life." After reading it, I shared my thoughts, and he asked me about my views on the Communist Party. He was very satisfied with my answers. He then further discussed my family situation with me and asked if I was willing to join the Party. I said I was. He asked me to write

a report, including my family situation, personal experiences, etc. It was about three months before I officially joined. After the oath, I officially joined the Party and attended meetings. There were three people in our branch: Tao Yao, Liu Jiming, and me. We often discussed Communist theories. Tao Yao sometimes brought red books for me to read or told us to buy books after he had read them. We met about once every one or two weeks, mostly at Liu Jiming's house, in his own room.

Tao Yao confessed that a few days later, someone found me. His surname was Zhang. He told me to wait for him in a few days with a red book at the entrance of the Huishan Theater in Tilanqiao. That day, someone came on a bicycle. He came to my house to talk and asked me about my family and school situation, which I told him. Later, he came again for another chat. Two weeks later, the person who came was changed to someone

surnamed Lin, named Lin Ying. From then on, he was the one who came to see me. He said: We are participating in the technical department and asked me to unite the graduated classmates. So I found Liu Jiming and Tao Long (after a dinner at the Central Bank Club), and they agreed.

Excerpt from Zhang Liangcai's confession: Finally, he said there was a very political group that regularly plans and reviews work, helps each other, and studies together. He asked if I was willing to join. I said I was. He then said that this group was the Chinese Communist Party. I wasn't that surprised because someone had asked me to join before. Then he asked me to write a self-introduction report. The report took several weeks to write and was completed in mid-November. On November 29th, Tao came and said that my joining had been approved by higher authorities. He took out a piece of paper with the following written on it: (1) Revolutionary interests are above all else; (2) I am willing to fight for the cause of communism for life; (3) Resolutely implement resolutions; (4) Strictly abide by Party discipline; (5) Be a lifelong model for the masses.

It was only when the night school was about to end that I connected with the Party's Education Department. Before this, I really wanted to go to the Liberated Areas because (1) it seemed like Qiming's work had no future, but Tao said that this was my central work; (2) I felt unsuitable for the activities of Dongqing; (3) I was interested in the night school for female workers, but Tao said that this was not the central work, but a side activity.

M contacted me several times and talked about

Two instructions: one was about the current situation, the "Anti-Liu Hangchen Peace Grand Alliance," and the other was about the student movement, reviewing the past student movement, and instructing on future principles (mainly to resolutely launch mass movements on issues of livelihood and national identity, break the illusions of the masses towards the Kuomintang, and combine the suffering of the masses with American aggression and the rule of the Kuomintang). One time was to introduce myself, and another time was to introduce Qiming. Regarding my work, M said to focus on the student work of the Education Department, then talked about Qiming's work and the night school. One time was to talk about an instruction (mainly: 1948 is the year of riots, such as the Shen Jiu incident at the beginning of the year, the Tongji student unrest, and the spontaneous dance craze. May is a surge, not a climax. Crossing the river is not the arrival of victory. To cooperate with the May surge, we must step up the organization of the masses and prepare a reserve army for victory among the backward masses, etc.).

Excerpt from Liu Jiming's confession: Because of my close personal relationship with Tao Yao,

I believed what he said. At the beginning of December last year, he talked to me about joining the Communist Party. I agreed to join the Party. He asked me to write a report stating my family situation, personal experiences, etc. I also agreed, but because I was sick, it took a long time to write. After giving it to him, he said that it had been approved for participation by higher authority. Then Tao and Long took me to

[missing character]'s house for an oath.

[Our Reporter] The highly anticipated men's and women's basketball championship round-robin games took place on the 15th at the gymnasium, with three games held in total. The first game, starting at 2:00 PM, was the women's basketball match between Shanghai and the Philippines. The Shanghai team, eager to win, appeared flustered upon entering the court, allowing the Philippine team to accumulate points.

The first men's basketball game was between the Joint Logistics Force and the Police, with the Police losing 58-46.

The second game was between Shanghai and the Philippine Chinese team, with many fans placing bets. It was rumored that one gentleman bet a billion dollars that the Philippine Chinese team would win. This newspaper had repeatedly predicted that if Shanghai played cohesively, they could win; if the Philippine Chinese team was mentally tense, they would ultimately lose. Yesterday, the Shanghai team displayed unexpectedly good teamwork. The Philippine Chinese team was initially calm but soon became tense.

### International Track and Field Match Chinese Athletes Achieve Great Victory Qi Peilin Throws Discus to a New Level Breaking the National Record with 42.15 Meters

[Our Reporter] To add icing to the cake of the National Games, the International Track and Field Friendship Match was held yesterday at the Games' track and field stadium, with the winning athletes from this National Games competing against Western expatriate athletes from the city. There were a total of fifteen events. Except for the 200-meter and hammer throw, which were won by Western expatriate representatives, the Chinese team representatives showed their skills and achieved a complete victory in all other events.

Athletes Qi Peilin (misregistered as "霖" when registering for the National Games) and Dong Feixing both created one new national record and two new Games records. Qi Peilin broke his own national record of 41.55 meters set in this National Games with a discus throw of 42.15 meters; he also broke his own Games record of 12.72 meters set this time with a shot put of 12.91 meters. High jumper Dong Feixing also broke the Games high jump record with an excellent result of 1.82 meters, all of which are valuable achievements.

In yesterday's events, the 400-meter was temporarily canceled due to insufficient Western expatriate participants, and a 200-meter low hurdles event was added. A hammer throw competition was also a new event, which has never been included in our country's National Games, and is a competition that our country has never practiced. Yesterday's competition had a promotional and performance nature. Wu Zhenwu, a representative of our country, created a result of 43.47 meters, which is truly remarkable.

The Western expatriate sports athletes in this city are lacking in talent, and there were not many participants. The relay teams were all hastily assembled, so yesterday's competition was not scored. Only the top four finishers in each event were recorded.

### The Most Valuable Gains in Track and Field: Javelin Throws Out A Dark Horse

The track and field events consisted of seven disciplines, which were completed smoothly in the morning and afternoon. The process was as follows: The javelin final began at 10:30 a.m., with more than ten participants. Among the foreigners, there were many burly figures, but their throws were awkward. Only Dixon of the American School managed to barely reach the 40-meter mark after several throws. The rest were dominated by Chinese athletes. Wang Xuewu of the Navy, whose leg injury had not yet healed, also achieved a result of 46.94 meters after several trial throws. However, Mr. Wang gave up calculating his ranking and score, so he was not listed. Zhang Xingxian from Taiwan originally took the lead with 47.65 meters, but unexpectedly, Huang Renyuan of the Air Force emerged as a dark horse, achieving 47.92 meters, surpassing all competitors and even exceeding the score of Chen Jichuan, the national javelin champion. Mr. Chen went to Beijing yesterday, and Zhu and others participated as representatives. Mr. Huang was temporarily drafted as a representative and surprisingly fulfilled his mission. Congratulations! The rankings are as follows: (1) Huang Renyuan (2) Zhang Xingxian (3) Xu Tiande (4) Wang Rui.

Discus Final: There were six participants, two Chinese and four foreigners. Qi Peilin's reputation was illustrious. His first throw reached 42.15 meters, surpassing his own national record of 41.5 meters set at this National Games. Another throw reached * * *.60 meters. The foreigners were all * * *. Wang Rui of the Air Force always made a "hmm" sound when releasing the discus, but his score was not weak, taking second place. Smith of the U.S. Navy, with a physique like King Kong, looked good but was useless, sharing third and fourth place with Bao Lai from the YMCA.

Shot Put Final: Began at 2 p.m. with seven participants. Qi Peilin from Tianjin threw casually and achieved 12.91 meters, further improving his大会record of 12.72 meters set at this competition by .19 meters. Old Qi is truly adorable. Bing Mingchuan from Taiwan displayed a fierce spirit, and his powerful throw reached 12.65 meters. Smith of the U.S. Navy only managed 12.30 meters, falling to third place. The fourth place went to Wu Zhenwu (Navy).

High Jump Final: Held concurrently with the shot put final, with six participants. Among them, Liu Mengjiu of the Army only tried jumping for his personal score and did not count his ranking, so there were actually only five people. Starting from 1.60 meters, everyone cleared it. When the bar was raised to 1.65 meters, Hess and Jeter of the YMCA failed three times each, and all the foreigners were eliminated. It became a pure competition among Chinese athletes. When the bar was raised to 1.78 meters, only Dong Feixing cleared it effortlessly. Zhang Liren and Yang Jirong failed three times each and were also defeated. When it was raised to 1.82 meters again, Feixing failed once, but cleared the bar easily on the second attempt, as graceful and beautiful as a kite turning over. Feixing was ambitious and immediately raised it to 1.85 meters, but failed both times, ultimately ending the competition with a record of 1.82 meters. The rankings are: (1) Dong Feixing (Taiwan) (2) Zhang Liren (Taiwan) (3) Yang Pihua (Taiwan) (4) Hess (YMCA).

Hammer Throw Final: Was the last event in yesterday's track and field events in the morning. This type of sport is still being officially introduced for public competition in our country for the first time. Only Wu Zhenwu from the Navy participated in this sport, while the other four were foreigners. Among them, only Miller of the American Legion had some skill in this sport, while the rest were mostly amateurs. Wu Zhenwu, however, had some research on this * *. Yesterday * * * was methodical, and several turning postures were especially beautiful, winning much applause from the audience. He threatened Miller several times, and Miller, fearing being * *, used all his strength, resulting in an injury to his left arm. The hammer throw results were only considered for Miller and Wu because only they were good enough. Miller's score was 43.47 meters, and Wu Zhenwu's was 42.65 meters.

Long Jump Final: There were ten participants in the long jump, Chinese and foreign athletes. Zhang Liren won the championship with 6.64 meters. Huang Jian was second with 6.62 meters, only slightly different. Li Fen was third with 6.35 meters, and Soviet Novo-Golov was fourth with 6.315 meters. The remaining six all failed to surpass the 6-meter mark. Zhang Liren only achieved 6.64 meters on his sixth jump, while Huang Jian achieved 6.62 meters on his second jump, but did not improve in the subsequent four attempts. Li Fen's score was also achieved on his sixth jump. Yesterday's long jump scores were mediocre, but slightly better than the 6.47 meters at the National Games.

Triple Jump: In the triple jump, there were also three Chinese athletes participating, and they swept the top three spots. Huang Jian won the championship with 14.10 meters, Zhang Liren was second, and Zhang Liren was third. Only one foreigner, Stucker of the YMCA, was selected, placing fourth. Huang Jian's score was slightly better than the 14.01 meters at the National Games.

### Westerners' Strength Too Weak: Six Defeats in Seven Track Events

Seven track events were also held. The competition process is briefly described below:

100 Meters: Xu Tiande and Wang Songtao won first and second place respectively, without much effort. However, in the 200 meters, Xu Tong and Xu Tiantong encountered a strong opponent and were defeated by A. Ivanov of the YMCA. The score was 23 seconds flat, which was the only victory for the Western team in all track events yesterday.

400 Meters: Was temporarily cancelled because no foreigners participated.

800 Meters: With Yu Xiwei and Li Linglong representing the Chinese team, it was easy to win. Yu and Li had a fierce competition, and Li briefly surpassed at 700 meters, but Yu Xiwei's final sprint was effective, taking first place by about three meters. The three Western athletes were left behind by at least fifty meters.

1500 Meters: The strength of the Westerners was too disparate, and it was still a one-sided situation. Yu Xiwei defeated Yang Liansheng by about twenty meters.

110-Meter Hurdles: Huang Liangzheng had just recovered from a minor illness. Although he won first place, he was not satisfied. He knocked down the first and second hurdles, causing him to fall slightly behind, but gradually returned to normal after clearing the third hurdle. Xu Baochen was slightly weaker, finishing second. The Westerners' skills were not refined and there was little to describe.

200-Meter Low Hurdles: This event was temporarily added at the request of the Westerners. Rong Chengbi and Zhang Zhiqing joined as guest participants, winning first and second place respectively. Xu Baochen finished fourth, and American soldier George took third place.

400-Meter Relay: Only the Chinese, Soviet, American School, and YMCA teams participated. The Chinese team, represented by four athletes from Taiwan, namely Xu Tiande in the first leg, Lin Qiujiang in the second leg, Chen Xinhui in the third leg, and Xu Tong in the fourth leg, won very easily.

1600-Meter Relay: Only the Chinese and YMCA teams participated. The Chinese team led all the way, with a difference of fifty meters. The Chinese team representatives were Chen Wenyan in the first leg, Zhao Xuehong in the second leg, Zhou Zhixiong in the third leg, and Peng Kaizuo in the fourth leg.

### A Fine Tale on the Tennis Courts: Ye Guanxiong and Yang Weibin, a Virtuous Couple, Reside Separately on the King and Queen Thrones. The Men's and Women's Doubles Championships Await Unveiling Today.

[Report from our Newspaper] The men's tennis singles championship was produced yesterday. Ye Guanxiong from Guangzhou and his wife, Yang Weibin, each won the men's and women's singles championships respectively. Tao Guanqiu, who was initially the most highly touted to win the title, suffered a defeat in yesterday's final against Ye Guanxiong, falling to second place. Xu Weipei from Hong Kong was third, and Wang Wenzheng from the police was fourth. Yang Weibin's victory over Chen Jinshi from Indonesia a few days ago laid the foundation for her championship seat. This Javanese expert was forced to be ranked second. Zhu Zhiying from Shanghai was third, and Lu Yuanchun from Malaysia brought up the rear.

The men's and women's doubles championships will also be decided this morning. Judging from the battles of the past two days, the Xu brothers from Hong Kong have the highest hopes for the men's doubles, while the women's doubles is already in the bag for Indonesia.

The women's singles consolation tournament champion was Wang Jinshu from Guizhou. This is the result of continuous forfeits. The women's singles consolation tournament only had two matches actually played, with forfeits on one side in the remaining matches. Zhou Shuan from Fujian also forfeited in yesterday's consolation final.

The men's singles consolation tournament will hold the semi-finals at 9 a.m. today, and the winners will hold the final at 10:30 a.m.

As for the men's and women's doubles consolation tournament, due to the expiration of the competition period, it was decided not to hold it. All other tennis matches will be completed this morning.

In yesterday's men's singles final, Ye Guanxiong's match against Tao Guanqiu was particularly calm yesterday. His net attacks were repeatedly successful, and he finally defeated Guanqiu. Wang Wenzheng and Xu Weipei battled fiercely for four sets, with evenly matched results, but Wang Wenzheng forfeited in the fifth set due to physical exhaustion. Yang Weibin defeated Zhu Zhiying easily in the women's singles, winning the championship. The results are listed below:

The Tao-Ye Battle: Two and a Half Hours: Tao Guanqiu's decision in the final against Guanxiong The final yesterday lasted two and a half hours before a winner was decided. Tao Guanqiu's steady strokes were eventually broken by Ye's fierce high-pressure shots. After Tao and Ye each won one set, the third set became a stalemate. Ye Guanxiong managed to hold his breath and won 8-6. In the fourth set, Tao Guanqiu was unable to continue. Summarizing, he lost the throne 3-1.

Doubles Final: Tao and Wang Forfeit In yesterday afternoon's doubles final, policemen Tao Guanqiu and Wang Wenzheng forfeited. Ma Hua's Xie Luohua and Lin Xizhen scored two points. The Xu brothers defeated Chen Lichao and Li Wenxuan in straight sets. Yesterday, Chen and Li's performance was far less exciting than their match against Tao and Wang the day before, with many errors. The Xu brothers, on the other hand, cooperated well.

Women's Doubles: Ma and Yin Win In the women's doubles, Shanghai originally could have defeated Malaysia, but they were too eager to win and became flustered, eventually losing 2-1. Chen Jinshi and Zhang Meishan from Indonesia cooperated better. Luo Qiaoer from Guangzhou was weaker and made many mistakes. Yang * * * could not support the team alone and had to succumb.

### Referee Xu Shaowu's Injury Will Recover

[Report from our Newspaper] During the Shanghai vs. Dalian football match on the 9th of this month, after Dalian lost 3-1 to Shanghai, they took their anger out on referee Xu Shaowu and beat him. The referee committee severely punished them afterward, details of which have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that Mr. Xu's injury is recovering, but the organizing committee will file a lawsuit with their legal advisor. As for Mr. Xu's lost watch, the organizing committee has subsidized him 10 million national currency as compensation for his loss.

### The Last Act of the Football Championship Ends: Police, Hong Kong, and Army Share the Championship. Yesterday's Match Resulted in Two Draws for Police and Army.

[Report from our Newspaper] Yesterday was the last day of the football round robin. Because Shanghai's qualification was cancelled and Hong Kong had a bye, the only match was between Police and Army. Recently, due to frequent football disputes, the organizing committee strengthened security to prevent accidents, prohibiting all idlers from entering the field. Even newspaper reporters and photographers who were allowed to enter the field according to the organizing committee's regulations were kept out. Xuan * , * Shuping, Hao Gengsheng, and others sat high on rattan chairs, personally taking charge at the edge of the field, which attracted the attention of the entire audience. Spectators who had turned to the track and field field because the swimming pool and stadium were full, facing the solemn and tense atmosphere in the field, held their breath and watched quietly. The players of the Police and Army teams completed the final decisive battle for the championship in this special environment. Yesterday, the two teams played extremely loosely in the first half, and the situation was tighter in the second half. The Army team's tactics had made great progress, while the Police team had little performance other than short passes from the forwards. Therefore, the final * ended in a two-to-two draw.

At the same time as the battle unfolded, the Army Telecom team * protested again to the organizing committee regarding the Hong Kong team's foul in the Hong Kong vs. Army match. After the organizing committee convened a meeting to discuss the matter, they concluded that Hong Kong team member Liu Fuquan did indeed enter the field twice, and the referee did not notice, which * violated the football rules. The match should have been replayed, but because the organizing committee's closing ceremony was imminent and could not be held, it was decided that the Hong Kong vs. Army match at 4 p.m. on the 13th would be a draw, with each team receiving one point. After two important decisions and announcements by the organizing committee, the football disputes that had been disturbing for several days resulted in the following situation:

Chen Jinshi and Zhang Meishan (Indonesia) 2 0 4

Yang Weibin and Luo Qiaoer (Guangzhou) 1 1 2

Lu Yuanchun and Chen Junyu (Malaysia) 1 1 2

Zhu Zhiying and Ruan Li (Shanghai) 0 2 0

In summary, the results of this football round robin were that the Police, Hong Kong, and Army teams had the same score, and the number of goals scored was also the same. Therefore, the organizing committee decided to share the championship, and the three teams received the championship. The football championship round robin thus came to a successful end.

### Referee Resigns: Group Leader Takes the Field Personally The Competition Process Was Not Tense

Yesterday's match was held because the referee resigned and no one was willing to take the position. The head of the referee group, Jiang Lianggui, finally took the field personally, and Le Xiurong, chairman of the Shanghai Football Referee Association, and Fu Luoju, director of athletics at Nankai University, served as linesmen, allowing the match to proceed smoothly.

The match started at 4:45 p.m. The attack of the * team was not as tense as imagined. The Army forwards were more agile, and the Police seemed less brave and calm than in the previous two days. Both offense and defense were unusually weak. As a result, Luo Shou * and Zhang Jinhai took advantage, and after two passes, Gao Xiuqing caught up and headed the ball. The ball was not swift, but it went into the net. After that, Police center Zhao Fu led the team to counterattack. Within a few minutes, he dribbled the ball straight to the enemy's goal and shot from the left corner, scoring. This goal showed skill and power, so it won a lot of applause. The first half ended with a score of one to one.

After the start of the second half, Army defender Meng Yiliang first committed a handball. Xie Jinhe missed both penalty kicks. After a brief * , center Meng bumped into a player in the penalty area and was penalized with a twelve-yard penalty. Xie Jinhe took the kick and hit the ground, increasing the Police's score and boosting their morale. The short passes of the forwards were even more skilled. Wu Qixiang of the Army had not recovered from his foot injury and was replaced by Jiang Wenqing. Because he was very afraid that the defense would not be able to withstand the sharpness, he especially strengthened the Meng Xue line in the center, suppressing the Police forwards in every possible way. In a situation where the Police could not launch an attack, Zhang Jinhai got the ball and advanced quickly, taking a fierce shot that was blocked by Yu Yaode. While Yu was still in shock, Jinhai supplemented the shot and succeeded. After the score was tied at two to two, both sides were still thinking about finding an opportunity to rise again. As a result, Jin Lusheng and Xie Jinhe repeatedly showed excellent technical performances, but because time quickly ended, the two teams finally drew.

Police Team:

Jin Yaode Zeng Zhongyun Zheng Yingquan Mo Jinsong You Huaxing Liu Guangcai * Zhenhui Liu Tianshen * Fu Li Bingzhao Xie Jinhe

Army Team:

### Football Match Dispute Incident: Hubei Team Presents Three Opinions

[Report from our newspaper] The Hubei athletes team, regarding the dispute over the football elimination match between their team and Nanjing, specially hosted reporters yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Yu Jinsong, Chief of the Education Department of the Hubei Provincial Government and head of the team, along with football instructor Zeng Zichen, reported the facts of the incident, stating that their team did not engage in any physical assault. They claimed that this could be verified by the audience and journalists present at the scene, and acknowledged the unfairness of the refereeing at the event. Currently, the Hubei team has issued the following three points of opinion: (1) For the sake of protecting Hubei's reputation, the claims made by the organizing committee are inconsistent with the facts, and therefore, they cannot accept the punishment imposed upon them. (2) They request that the organizing committee provide concrete evidence of the assault, and the Hubei side will immediately admit wrongdoing and take responsibility for handing over the individuals involved. (3) The organizing committee's handling of this incident is absolutely unfair. The punishment given to Hubei in this event is more severe than that given to other units with evidence of assaulting referees, which is quite strange. The Hubei side has already submitted the above opinions in writing to the organizing committee, hoping for a reasonable resolution in the shortest possible time.

### Shanghai Football Team Also Raises Questions

[Another Report] The Shanghai football team, after forfeiting their match against the police and being penalized with a suspension from competition by the Judging Committee, also submitted questions to the organizing committee yesterday. They believe that Wang Wenzheng and Xu Weipei also forfeited a tennis match, but still appeared for the afternoon match without any penalties from the organizing committee. Therefore, they request an investigation and equal treatment for all. According to inquiries made by our reporter with relevant parties, the congress is scheduled to conclude today, and these two disputes may likely remain unresolved.

### Ban on Reporters Entering the Venue: Newspapers Lodge Protests

The interviewing and photography reporters from various newspapers in the city have lodged a protest with the National Games due to their inability to enter the venue yesterday to cover the news of the army vs. police football match. The content of the protest letter is as follows:

"To whom it may concern, yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, during the army vs. police football championship round-robin match held at the National Games athletics field, news reporters and photography reporters from our newspapers and others were all prohibited from entering the venue for interviewing and photography. According to Articles 8 and 9 of the 'National Games News and Photography Reporter Interview Regulations' stipulated by the organizing committee's publicity team, news reporters and photography reporters may enter the athletics competition venue for interviewing and news gathering, with the following limitations on the number of people allowed: A. Each newspaper with a sports section is allowed one person. B. Other special circumstances will be decided by the review committee. It is clear that there was no blanket ban on reporters entering the venue. Furthermore, at the time, there were several individuals inside the venue who were not authorized to be there, claiming to be "standing committee members," arrogantly sitting on rattan sofas and acting like a privileged class. This measure by the organizing committee clearly violates its own regulations. We hereby formally lodge a protest and request an immediate response."

### Resolving Football Match Disputes: Judging Committee Decides, Equal Scores, Tied Rankings

[Report from our newspaper] The National Games Judging Committee held its fifth committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM in the Municipal Sports Academy Principal's Office on the second floor of the swimming pool. Chairman Wang Zhengting, committee members Wu Bangwei, Song Junfu, Gao Zi, Liu Huakun, and Qian Xucang were in attendance. Hao Gengsheng, Shao Rugan, and others were also present, totaling more than ten people. The resolutions included two items:

(1) Discussion of the protest raised by the army team regarding the Hong Kong vs. army football match at 4:00 PM on the 13th. Resolution: During the Hong Kong vs. army football match, Hong Kong team member Liu Fuquan entered the field twice. The referee did not immediately verify this at the time, which violated football rules. The match should have been replayed. However, since the congress is about to close and a replay is impossible, the match should be considered a draw, with each team receiving one point.

(2) Discussion on how to handle situations where teams have equal scores in various ball game competitions. Resolution: 1. Women's volleyball: Shanghai, Hunan, and Taiwan have equal scores and are tied for champion. Guangzhou is fourth. 2. Men's volleyball: Police, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou have equal scores and are tied for champion. Shanghai is fourth. 3. Women's basketball: Shanghai is champion. Indian-Chinese, Fujian, and Philippine-Chinese have equal scores and are tied for runner-up. 4. Men's softball: Taiwan is champion. Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Police have equal scores and are tied for runner-up. 5. Football: Police, Hong Kong, and Army have equal scores and are tied for champion.

### Splashing Waves: Malayan-Chinese Water Polo - Brilliant and Radiant

— Our reporter Hong Xucai

[Special report from our newspaper] The Malayan-Chinese water polo team has a history of over ten years. Since its establishment, it has won every battle and has been invincible. It has a reputation as the "ever-victorious team" in Malaya.

In 1936, when the World Games were held in Berlin, Japan won the swimming championship. After the World Games concluded, when Japanese athletes were returning to their country from Berlin, they passed through Singapore and had a friendly match with the Malayan-Chinese water polo team. The Malayan-Chinese team surprisingly defeated Japan by a score of 9 to 5. From then on, Japan had to view the Malayan-Chinese water polo team in a different light, and the world had to re-evaluate its strength.

The Malayan-Chinese water polo team has a very glorious record: In 1940, when the Hong Kong swimming team traveled to Malaya, there was a water polo match, which the Malayan-Chinese team won by a score of 10 to 0. Before coming to Shanghai, they also played a match against the Military United Football Team, and won by a score of 9 to 2. This time, to attend the National Games, they also held a competition with the famous Penang water polo team in that area, and defeated Penang by a score of 8 to 0.

Each member of the Malayan-Chinese water polo team has fifteen to twenty years of experience. They absolutely have the confidence when it comes to playing water polo. They hope to find an opportunity to attend the World Games to be held in London in July. All preparations are being discussed by the Singapore World Games Organizing Committee.

### He Lutian Returns to Malaya: First Thing is a Lawsuit

The water polo team has a total of seven members, with He Lutian taking on the role of coach. When Mr. He spoke of the Malayan-Chinese water polo team, he seemed unable to suppress his proud demeanor. Coach He set off from Singapore to Shanghai. In his haste, he accidentally ran over and killed a person on the street. The car overturned, and he sustained skin injuries all over his body. This matter is still unresolved, so he said, "The first thing I have to do upon returning to Malaya is face a lawsuit."

### Backstroke Champion Huang Bixia: Ten Years of Water Sports

The Malayan-Chinese swimming athletes, totaling nineteen, must all arrive half an hour before the start of the swimming competition each day, line up and sit in the right corner of the pool, and constantly cheer for the Malayan-Chinese athletes. In yesterday's program, the Malayan-Chinese team won several finals championships, so their emotions were particularly excited.

The Malayan-Chinese athlete Huang Bixia, who won the women's 100-meter backstroke final, is twenty-four years old and has been swimming for ten years. She is already the mother of three children.

During the finals, Malayan-Chinese athlete Zhong Yaobo suddenly experienced leg cramps. After being pulled out of the water, he was immediately carried by the Boy Scouts to the medical office, where the nurse applied turpentine. Along the way, Zhong Yaobo kept shouting "Ouch" repeatedly.

Malayan-Chinese athletes from Singapore said that their local white uniforms are more beautiful than Shanghai's, with crisp material and a well-fitting style. The clothes of the Shanghai nursing sisters are made too big.

Overseas Chinese male athletes unanimously praised the beauty of Shanghai ladies, their fair skin, and good figures, which are rare to see elsewhere.

Runner-up Zhang Yunying from Taiwan, age nineteen, is a senior student at Taipei First Girls' High School. She has been swimming for five years and has won the Taiwan Provincial Games championship twice.

Third-place Zheng Yanying from Guangdong-Guangzhou, age fourteen, is one of the Zheng sisters. Her younger sister, Xueying, is only thirteen years old and has only been swimming for one year. This time, the sisters came to Shanghai with the Guangzhou delegation alone and stayed at the Central Training Corps dormitory, taking care of everything themselves. The previous two days, due to eating the wrong things, they suffered from diarrhea, so their performance greatly declined. Su Tianmo, the coach of the Guangzhou swimming team, expressed great regret. In the past two days, he has personally increased supervision of the sisters' diet.

Why Didn't the Referee Come?

The Shanghai-Hunan women's volleyball final, after the unpleasant breakup at the Municipal Sports Hall last time, was decided by the Organizing Committee Refereeing Committee to be replayed yesterday morning. Both teams' players arrived at the venue at 9:00 AM, but after waiting for a long time, the referee had not arrived. People in the venue all said that no one might be willing to be the enforcer of this volleyball match, because the scene of shouting and fighting at the Sports Hall last time had given people a very bad impression. However, after half an hour, the referee Xu Minhui finally arrived slowly, and the match immediately began.

Strange! Shanghai's Performance is Perplexing

The Shanghai women's volleyball team, in this round-robin competition, had successively defeated Taiwan and Guangzhou, and each performance was of high quality. Especially with the presence of sand court veterans Chen Meizhen, Huang Mingyuan, Wang Weizhen, etc., there was no doubt that they would win the championship this time. Last time at the Municipal Sports Hall, they also defeated the Hunan team by a score of 21-4 in the first game; unexpectedly, yesterday, each veteran had an abnormal performance, and Chen Meizhen and others contributed almost nothing. Especially in the final stage of the second game, the more they lost, the more chaotic they became, completely falling into a passive position, and losing in a perplexing manner!

Weird! Like Two Different People Before and After

In the first round, the Shanghai army was at a disadvantage and lost points consecutively. The Hunan side's Zheng Peikun constantly attacked with fierce spikes, while Shanghai's killer Chen Chengzhen could not block the net and did not get a good opportunity to kill the ball. Even if she did kill it, it was plain and unremarkable, and not enough to achieve success. Huang Mingyuan did not see any new achievements, and compared to the past, she was like two different people. Therefore, the furthest difference in points was 10 to 20. Finally, although Meizhen and others pulled back a few balls, they still lost 14 to 21.

Alas! Losing the Entire Country

During the intermission, the Shanghai side tried to counterattack, once forming a four-point tie. Later, Meizhen and others used their old tricks again, specializing in attacking the Hunan team's weakest third row, gaining a lead of 7 to 4. Then they regained an advantage of 15 to 12. Everyone thought that Shanghai could save the overall situation, but after a 15-point tie, the Shanghai ladies almost fell into a slump. The Hunan team served, and the Shanghai army could not respond. Before long, the Shanghai team was at a disadvantage of 16 to 21, losing the entire great country.

Hunan: Zheng Peiji, Liu Xingheng, Zheng Peikun, Qin Benze, Zeng Yuyuan, Liu Yunshan, Chen Chunxiu, Liao Zhiqiang, Liu Zhulan

Shanghai: Zhu Jinyun, Chen Meizhen, Wang Shan, Chen Liuzhen, Wang Weizhen, Huang Mingyuan, Xiang Yulin, Chen Jieshu, Lu Zhaoshan

Tragic! Hong Kong's Loss is So Bitter

In the men's volleyball battle between Hong Kong and the police, Hong Kong faced the police with its original lineup, but its net blocking technique was broken by the police (according to reports, the police took advantage of the quick kill and speed spike angles, which made Hong Kong's net blocking technique fail). At the same time, they defended more than they attacked, so the police's strategy of "attacking with all their strength" worked wonders, causing Hong Kong to suffer an unprecedented defeat.

Fortunately! Finally Regaining Lost Ground

What made people have high hopes for Hong Kong was that in the Hong Kong-Guangzhou battle at the Municipal Sports Hall before, the Hong Kong team was indeed exceptionally skilled. By the time of the Hong Kong-Shanghai battle, Hong Kong had slightly regressed, and yesterday was especially bad. In the first game yesterday, the opening repeatedly became a tie. The Hong Kong side once had good contact, and the three rows of ball assists were also successful. However, after the fourth point, Hong Kong felt the threat of the police's front row left-wing spike, and even the good player Zhong Shiyuan lost the ball. Fortunately, Yu Qien fought back with a fierce spike, regaining lost ground. They once competed with the police side by side at the ninth and tenth points. After that, the Hong Kong army's spike was bounced back by the opponent. In this way, the police side fought hard and won the first game 21 to 14.

Good! The Police Have Face

In the second game, the police team took the lead. The Hong Kong front row repeatedly lost points by touching the net with their hands, which wronged many good balls. The police's first row left spike specialized in attacking the weaknesses of the Hong Kong team (third row right), scoring many points. The entire Hong Kong team almost all lost their composure. In terms of contact, the ball supply and ball delivery were not working. Yu Qien was also shut down by the opponent. Therefore, Hong Kong entered a state of hard defense. It is known that this defensive situation created a passive stance. Therefore, the police were able to achieve a great victory of 21 to 4.

Pity! The Hong Kong Team Miscalculated Everything

In the last round, the police team had already won two games, and their energy was abundant. The attack became more and more energetic. The false movements of the front row achieved quite good results. Although Hong Kong calmly fought hard, they once got a seven-point tie, but the overall situation did not improve. When changing sides, the Hong Kong side replaced Shao Xianrong, who lost many balls in the third row right, with Zhao Shijian, but it still did not help the overall situation. Since then, Hong Kong made more and more mistakes, and finally lost the third game 13 to 21, causing the entire army to be destroyed, which was unexpected.

Police: Yi Ruijian, Ren Xianzhan, Huang Yongdong, Ni Peilin, Chen Xianghua, Huang Yumin, Jun Yule, Li Rujiu, Wu Quanjun

Hong Kong: Lin Runming, Chen Changyong, Ouyang Zhaotang, Chen Shude, Wang Yaomin, Yu Qien, Zhao Shirun, Zhong Shiyuan, Li Limei

(Li Limei replaced Shao Xianrong in the second half of the third game)

Fortunately! The Personnel Adjustment is Not Bad

In the men's volleyball match between Shanghai and Guangzhou, although the Shanghai team was generally expected to win the fourth place in the recent round-robin competition, each of the three battles did show improvement, which cannot be said to be unrelated to the adjustment of the lineup. For example, the original lineup had Zhan Chen playing the first row right, and his performance was very unsatisfactory, but after replacing him with Wang Junbing, the team's strength greatly changed, because Wang's fierce spike had unique merit. Yesterday, Wang Junbing also made many achievements. At the same time, after Zheng Yiquan and Weng Chengguang re-switched positions yesterday, they made many achievements in the attack. Huang Xiuhua seems to be more suitable for playing in the third row left than in the third row middle. Shanghai won the first game yesterday, and it was entirely due to the attack of Wang, Zheng, Weng, and others, and the ball supply of Huang Xiuhua, Cheng Shining, and others.

Weak! Shanghai Expected it Would be Difficult to Win

However, in terms of the power of attack, the average of strength, and the disguised attack, the Shanghai team was naturally inferior to Guangzhou. For example, Li Lianze in the front row of Guangzhou and Chen Rongkuan in the back row were both better than Shanghai's Zhuan Jia and Cheng Shining. Yesterday, after the Shanghai team won the first game, they lost the next three games, which was also expected.

Numbers! This is Not a Sin of War

In the first game yesterday, the Shanghai team took full attack, and the two generals in the front row middle and right, and the two wings in the second row contributed a lot; in the next three games, the Shanghai team continued to develop its original combat power. However, Guangzhou's three-row left and right wings spikes were very strong, and Shanghai was mostly unable to rescue them. However, the Shanghai team had also fully exerted its combat power, so although all three games were lost, the scores were not too far apart. The scores of the four games were: 14-21, 21-15, 21-17, 21-11.

Guangzhou: Pan Jinhong, Li Lianze, Zhou Hao, Zhao Lianwu, Mei Yi, Mei Songfu, Zhao, Chen Yingkuan, Li Xinglin

Shanghai: Wang Junbing, Kong, Weng Guang, Wei Dingsen, Zheng Yiquan, Peng Zhongquan, Cheng Shining, Huang Xiuhua

### Taiwan and Guangdong Win Men's and Women's Softball Championships, Respectively; The Guangdong-Gansu Women's Softball Match is No Different Than Crushing an Egg with a Stone

[Report from our newspaper] The softball championship round-robin tournament has reached its final stage. Taiwan and Guangdong won the men's and women's groups respectively. The three teams, Guangdong, Shanghai, and Police, tied for second place in the men's group. There is still one game left in the women's group between Nanking and Shanghai, which will be held at 9:00 AM this morning at the Grand Games Athletics Field.

There were three games yesterday. The women's group Guangdong vs. Gansu started at 9:00 AM in the Athletics Field. Guangdong defeated Gansu badly, no different from crushing an egg with a stone. The score was 23 to 0, breaking the new scoring record for this year's Grand Games softball tournament. The Guangdong team won all three games in the round-robin tournament, winning the women's group championship.

The men's Guangdong vs. Police was held at Yiyuan after the men's elimination final, Fuhua vs. Navy. The Guangdong team lineup is as follows:

In the fourth inning, the police's Fang Qiuhu stole a base. In the fifth inning, Guangdong's Ma Qunxian, Mai Guangwen, and others hit home runs, adding three more points. In the seventh inning, Guangdong lost Jingzhou due to carelessness and underestimation of the enemy. The police ran five consecutive runs, totaling six to ten. The police were defeated.

At 2:00 PM, Taiwan encountered Shanghai at Yiyuan. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

Taiwan: Zhang Qiuqin (pitcher), Xu Ciyi (catcher), Xue Yongshun (first base), Wang Jinzhu (second base), Fang Shaobo (third base), Yang Dongbang (shortstop), Chen Chirong (left field), Zhang Naixiang (right field), Chen Liangchen (center field).

After that, the two armies advanced step by step and did not score any points. Taiwan won 4 to 2, winning the men's group championship. The men's group results already played are recorded below:

### Men's Softball Competition All Over: Fujian Wins Elimination Championship: Victory Over Navy by a Score of Seventeen to Six

[Report from our newspaper] The men's softball elimination final between Fujian and the Navy was held at Yiyuan yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. The Fujian team is the incarnation of the former Shanghai Sharks team. Most of the team members are students from St. John's University. They have tacit understanding and rich experience. The strength of the Navy team is also strong. Let us first recognize the lineups of the two teams:

Fujian team: Zhang Zhaoyu, Pan Dade (pitcher), Wang Xiunan (catcher), Chen Cuixiang, Ye Weiquan (first base), Guo Dunli (second base), Wei Wu (third base), Cao Qijia (shortstop), Jiang Yanin (left field), Zhu Jizu (right field), Li Rongbang (center field).

Navy team: Lu Yixi (pitcher), Lv Defu (catcher), Gao Songzhen (first base), Huang Longshun (second base), Lin Qingli (third base), Xu Fuyin (shortstop), Tan Naisheng (left field), Han Tongshun (right field), Li Rongjin (center field).

The referee was Liang Fuchu. The Navy attacked first. The Fujian team's defense was tight, and the Navy failed to show its power. When Fujian switched from defense to attack, the Navy was timid and was scored four consecutive points by the Fujian team. In the second round, the Navy's Tan Naisheng safely returned to home base. In the fourth and fifth innings, the Fujian boys suddenly exerted their strength. Pan Dade hit safely, Zhu Jizu sacrificed, and the remaining six or seven people all returned to home base, scoring as many as thirteen points. Only Gao Songzhen, Huang Longshun, and others of the Navy scored. As a result, Fujian won the elimination tournament championship by a score of 17 to 6.

### Banks Continue to Tighten Credit, Financial Control Bureau Strictly Investigates Returned Checks

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, the financial authorities continued to work hard to tighten credit and sell off materials, and general prices continued to fall. The National Treasury again transferred in 800 billion, and credit became even tighter, with black market interest rates as high as 30% or more. The market price of rice has stabilized. The Civil Adjustment Committee yesterday began to sell off. The China Industrial Trust Company is still selling off flour, priced at 1.85 million per bag, and sold off a total of 8,300 bags. Market conditions are generally bearish. Chinese stocks have fallen sharply, with Yong Yarn once falling to 2,560 yuan. Other Chinese stocks have also fallen. Among the commodities, sugar, artificial silk, cotton yarn, paper, and other prices have uniformly declined. Cotton yarn has even fallen by about 10%. According to observation, the May rally has almost passed.

The authorities continued to sell off materials and tighten credit. Yesterday, the four banks and two bureaus of the bill exchange again transferred in 874.4 billion. Foreign banks also transferred in 293 billion. Credit is tight as never before. The central bank transferred in 635.9 billion, China transferred in 64.2 billion, Transportation transferred out 97.4 billion, Farmers transferred in 78.9 billion, China Industrial Trust Company transferred in 185.4 billion, Postal Service transferred out 6.2 billion, Cooperative Treasury transferred in 13.6 billion. Big Exchange transferred out 500.7 billion, and Small Exchange transferred out 666.7 billion.

Recently, due to tight credit, the trend of bounced checks has revived. The number of bounced checks on the 14th reached as many as 900 billion. The Financial Control Bureau has begun to thoroughly investigate, and will legally investigate whether the responsibility belongs to the customer or the bank itself. According to Financial Control Bureau Director Li, the bounced checks occurred because of the use of checks for collateral. When the collateral exceeded the scope of the overdraft, if the customer's checks were presented for payment, the bank would refuse to pay, and naturally return the checks during exchange. Therefore, Director Li emphasized that the use of today's checks as collateral should never be allowed. The Ministry of Finance has set June 1st as the date for implementation, and Director Li said that he would strictly enforce it. The phenomenon of bounced checks can be avoided. If it happens again, the bank will be fully responsible. Director Li also explained that the checks that are being banned next month are checks without proper authorization. Bank drafts, certified checks, and others can all be used as collateral.

### Tight Money, Weak Rice Prices: The People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee Did Not Sell Yesterday; Flour Initially Weak Then Rose, While Coarse Grains and Oil Cakes Continued to Fall

The decline in the rice market has intensified, with prices falling within the range for selling off rice reserves. Therefore, the People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee did not release any yesterday. As the price at the production area of Wuxi reportedly fell significantly, public confidence is extremely low. Coupled with the increasingly severe tight money situation, sales in this city are particularly stagnant, leading to a sharp price drop. High-quality rice is also being sold on samples.

Corn prices in Qingdao were reportedly low, and out-of-town buyers were not interested, leading to another drop of 300,000 [currency units]. Red beans continued to fall by 200,000 [currency units], with very little trading in high-quality beans. Sesame seeds were down by 600,000 to 700,000 [currency units], with a lack of trading in high-quality seeds. Raw peanuts fell sharply by 1 million [currency units].

### No New Buying, Many Trying to Unload: Yarn and Cloth Continue to Fall

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was affected by the unusually tight money situation both within and outside the industry, as well as the repeated suspension of [紗建公司]yarn construction company's listings and the large-scale distribution of allocations, which increased the supply of chips on the market. Some operators with tight positions were constantly selling off their inventory. With limited buying interest and few new purchases, the market experienced oversupply. As a result, 42-count Jianfeng fine yarn opened lower in the morning and fell to the 300 million [currency units] mark. Near the close, there was some opportunistic buying to cover short positions, but it ultimately closed at 300.2 million [currency units], a further decline of 25 million [currency units] compared to the previous day. 21-count Double Horse yarn also fell sharply to 182.2 million [currency units], a decrease of 26 million [currency units].

### Continued Sales of Large Inventories: Local Stocks Continue to See Low Prices

Yesterday, major holders of local stocks continued to sell off their large inventories. Banks sold off a significant amount. Various internal fears were exacerbated, and public confidence was shaken. The bearish sentiment intensified, and low prices continued to appear, but there was more short selling than buying of stocks. After the initial decline, the market rebounded.

The market opened bearish in the morning due to public anxiety. Yong Yarn opened at a low of 2,620 yuan, and fell to 2,595 yuan. Although it rallied to 2,635 yuan, it retreated to 2,605 yuan. Number 152 rose to 2,650 yuan. Brokerage fees opened high at 29 yuan and 33 yuan. Number 102 and others sold off, and the price fell to 2,600 yuan. Number Nine Wang only rallied to 2,645 yuan.

Overseas stocks rebounded, and the market closed at 2,600 yuan at noon. Compared to the previous close, Xinyi was flat, Qinxing rose slightly, Zhongni fell by 10%, and Liandi hit its upper limit.

Compared to the previous close, Jia and Yi fell by 7,000 yuan, Bing fell by 10,000 yuan, and Ding and Wu each fell by 10,000 yuan.

Overseas stocks rebounded easily yesterday due to buying by foreign banks and weak underlying demand. Yi Yarn opened surprisingly low at the 4 million [currency units] mark, but this was a buying price, and it rose to 4.2 million [currency units] before a trade was made. There was speculation about the listed price, and it closed high at around 4.58 million [currency units] at noon. Compared to the previous close, British Union, Jardine Matheson, and shipping were flat. Paperboard fell slightly. Yiguangyi rose by 5%, and the rest experienced slight increases.

### Yarn Merchants Panic

The Shanghai Cotton Yarn Merchants Association panicked yesterday when the police department arrested 11 member yarn merchants, including Yifeng, Yisheng, and Fulong, at 4:00 PM on the 13th on suspicion of hoarding. Yesterday, the members unanimously requested that the directors and supervisors of the association petition the authorities on several points: (1) To stipulate trading methods and clarify which behaviors constitute illegal activities, so that they can be followed. (2) Not to arbitrarily detain merchants in the future unless there is actual criminal behavior. (3) To request the Flower Management Committee to express its opinion on this matter. Mr. Tang, the chairman of the association, not only tried his best to advise the members yesterday, but also convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss countermeasures.

### Decision to Issue Two More Types of Short-Term Treasury Bills

The Central Bank was ordered to issue short-term treasury bills at the end of last month. To date, half a month later, more than 1.4 trillion [currency units] of treasury bills have been sold. The bank, seeing the good results of the treasury bill issuance, will not only expand the sales area but also issue two more types. The bank's vice president told reporters last night: "To facilitate the purchase of treasury bills by all sectors, in addition to the original one-month term, the bank has decided to issue two more types of treasury bills in Shanghai: one maturing at the end of the month and one maturing in the middle of the month." It has been decided that the first type, maturing on the 15th of next month, will be issued starting next Monday, and the other type will be issued at the beginning of next month. According to him, the discount for these new treasury bills will vary daily, so the listed price will be adjusted as the date progresses. Mr. Liu also said that the treasury bill program is still in the trial stage, and there may be changes and expansion of the sales area in the future. As for the issue of listing treasury bills, he said that this has not yet been considered.

### Unauthorized Construction of Private Roads: Victims Can Sue According to Law

[From all farmers in Jianmin Township, Hukuan, Suzhou] We are all farmers from Jianmin Township, Hukuan, Suzhou, making a living from agriculture. Unexpectedly, a certain [種類]school nearby has built a private road, using [等等]hundreds of acres of our good farmland without authorization, without any [手續]procedures or compensation for the land value. Most of our farming households are facing [飢餓]hunger and displacement because all of our good farmland has been occupied. We respectfully request answers to the following three questions, for which the farmers will be grateful!

(1) If the state [徵用]requisitions land for a [公共]public road, can the cost of the roadbed be [補償]purchased from the people? (2) Can the owners of the land on which a private road is built demand compensation from the builder or file a lawsuit? (3) Now that the road has been built, but the land has not been purchased nor has the owner's consent been obtained, can we request the competent authority to restore the land to its original state?

[Answer from lawyer Chuan Kuang] (1) The compensation for land price, compensation fees, and relocation fees that should be given for the requisition of land shall be determined by the competent municipal or county land administration agency. The person needing the land must pay these fees to the competent municipal or county land administration agency for transfer. (See Article 236 of the Land Law) (2) If a private road is built without applying for [徵收]requisition and approval and compensation for land prices in accordance with the Land Law, a [刑事]criminal lawsuit can be filed in accordance with Article 354 of the Criminal Law for damage [財產]property, and a [民事]civil request can be attached for restoration to the original state and compensation for damages. (3) You can jointly negotiate with them to restore the original state. If they ignore you, proceed according to law.

### On Respecting Officials

— Xuanxuan

In this democratic era, this century of the people, to write "On Respecting Officials" instead of "On Despising Officials" shows how backward the person's mind is. But what I mean is that officials are also people, but officials are experts in governing the people, and this "governing" is entrusted to them by the people. Therefore, officials are a kind of [藝術]artistic talent, and what China lacks most is [藝術]artistic talents, so how can we not respect officials?

Chinese people often translate the English "Public servant" as "公僕" (public servant). This is really problematic. Treating technical talents who dedicate themselves to the people as domestic slaves in the feudal era is not a phenomenon that should exist in a democratic era. This word should be translated as "服務[於]公衆的人" (people who serve the public), so that the true character of officials can be revealed.

The day before yesterday, I attended a small banquet, mostly attended by so-called "national industrialists" of the middle class in Shanghai. Among them was someone who had just come from Nanjing. Talking about this election, someone took out 2 trillion, someone took out 800 billion, etc. Then a "national industrialist" Mr. A sighed with his head turned: "These are all the fat and [膏]grease of the people, aren't they our people's money?" "National industrialist" Mr. B nodded in approval. When I saw them in this spirit, it seemed a bit righteous. But then I thought, aren't they themselves also scraping the fat and grease of the people, taking the people's money? Who are the speculators? Who are the ones raising prices wildly? When officials take the people's money, it's called "corruption," a crime deserving of death. When businessmen rob the people's money, it's called "being good at business," not only is it not illegal, but it's as if the people's money deserves to be squeezed out of them. Today's laws [難道]aren't they more generous to businessmen than to officials? Thinking of the entourage of officials in the feudal era and comparing it with today's officials having to flatter businessmen, it really seems that being an official is the end of the road for those who have the art of governing the world. Why not do business, [卻]but be an official?

China is also one of the most demanding countries in terms of treatment of officials. The income of a specially appointed official is far less than that of opening a small cigarette and paper shop in an alley. What else is there to say? When corruption becomes a tool for a person to survive, what else can we demand? "The emperor does not send hungry soldiers." We can't even give them ordinary living expenses. Do we still have the face to scold people for corruption? If they don't corrupt, should we ask them to [餓]starve themselves and work for you? General Chen Cheng, who has been in the military for half his life, admitted that his salary was not enough to cover his expenses, and he had to rely on his wife's [嫁妝]dowry to subsidize his life. If this is the truth, then the people are really messed up.

In terms of pre-war living standards, a mayor's official salary of 2,000 yuan per month was definitely not excessive. In today's terms, that would be at least 1.2 billion per month, but if a mayor really took a monthly salary of 1.2 billion, some people would come out and say that this is too wasteful of the country's money. If it is a businessman, earning tens of billions or hundreds of billions per month is not uncommon. In fact, the mayor's 1.2 billion is the due reward for working for the citizens, while the businessman's earning tens of billions or hundreds of billions is nothing more than scraping money from the heads of the people. But the observations of ordinary people are so different, isn't it strange?

Since the situation of today's officials is so unfavorable, why are there so many officials still [佔]in positions, even scheming for them? This cannot but be attributed to the large number of "official talents" in our country. Any commodity, if it is oversupplied, will drop in price, and "official talents" are no exception. Thinking of this, I can't help but sigh three times for the officials! I also shed tears for this group of intellectuals and technical talents who have no way out in China!

Fortunately, I have never held an official position in my life. Saying these words, I can say that I am not exaggerating my virtues, but truly sympathizing with others.

### Talking About "Hitting"

— Liuyun

"Hitting" in the twentieth century is a popular and exciting word. Apart from the two world wars that were "hit," usually in various parts of the world—especially in our China, which has been the case since ancient times and is even more prevalent today!—you can hear the sound of "hitting" at any time and see the scene of "hitting" everywhere. If you don't agree with each other, you wipe your [袖]sleeves and punch each other, starting a big fight. During the National Assembly meeting in the [耀武揚威]glare of domestic and foreign [耳]ears, there was an incident of fighting, and recently, the National Games has been constantly heard of "hitting." Examining our country's misuse of the word "hit" did not start today, it can be said to be a national essence that has existed since ancient times.

According to 歸田錄Gui Tian Lu: "Today, the corruption of common language, and all the gentlemen and villains in the world are the same in their mistakes, only the word "hit" is. Its meaning originally meant to examine and strike, so people fight each other, strike each other with objects, all are called hitting. And it is okay to say that craftsmen making gold and silver utensils also "hit", because it has the meaning of [衝]impact and striking. As for those who build boats and armies, they say building boats "hit boats" and building carts "hit carts," netting fish is called "hit fish," drawing water is called "hit water," serving food to laborers is called "hit food," giving clothes and rations to soldiers is called "hit clothes and rations," attendants holding umbrellas is called "hit umbrellas," using paste to stick paper is called "hit paste," using rulers to measure land is called "hit measure," raising one's hand to wipe the dizziness of the eyes is called "hit wipe," and even famous scholars and erudite scholars all say this, calling everything "hit," and after searching through the dictionaries, there is no such word (pronounced Ding Ya 反). Its meaning mainly examines and strikes, and the "hit" of it, since it is pronounced "Zhe Geng", in terms of character studies, the character "hit" is from hand from Ding, and Ding has the sound of striking objects, so the sound "Zhe Geng" is correct, I don't know why it turned into "Ding Ya.""

From this, we learn that this word "hit" is "the same mistake of gentlemen and villains." But although the word "hit" is lacking in literary sense, it doesn't matter much to say it orally. But if people really fight with real materials, it is a bit of that! In any case, it should be reviewed and corrected.

### Remembering Yu Shuyan

— Chen Yixian

At Du Shou's charity performance last year, the most prominent among the famous actors from the north and south was Meng Xiaodong. On the first day she took the stage, the value of the flower baskets converted into cash broke Shanghai's record. She [戲]sang "Searching for the Orphan and Saving the Orphan" for three days, bewitching the entire Shanghai audience. At that time, walking into dance halls, bars, or cafes, you could often hear the lyrics "The wife doesn't need to be too fierce." Today, the male role [老生] is able to be so popular, it can really overwhelm Dr. Mei.

Meng Xiaodong learned this play from Yu Shuyan, and other plays such as "Catching and Releasing" were also personally taught by Yu Daxian (Yu Shuyan's alias). It's a pity that when Xiaodong became a disciple, Shuyan had already stopped performing. Otherwise, if Xiaodong could learn from the stage Yu Shuyan's hand and [眉]foot [舉]movements, and the natural combination of the ups and downs, speeds, and weights of his voice, then with Xiaodong's intelligence, she would definitely be able to become Yu Shuyan's successor.

Li Shaochun is also a disciple of Shuyan. He is proud of the play "Fighting Taiping". I have seen Shaochun's play, and I feel that he is still far from Shuyan. Before the outbreak of the July 7th Incident, every year when school let out for summer vacation, I would always go to Beiping to stay for a while. Shuyan's residence at No. 2 Chunshu Xia Lane was a must-visit place. Every three or four days, I often went to Shuyan's place with two or three friends late at night to [談]chat for [整]the day. Around 12 o'clock [子]midnight, Shuyan had finished eating cigarettes, and it was the time of his best [充沛]energy. Although he had not performed for a long time, he would always sing one or two plays every night to practice his voice, which really made people enjoy the [戲]opera. After listening to the opera, around one or two o'clock, we would eat [解兒餅]Jie'er pancakes for supper, which was also a kind of gastronomic pleasure. At that time, Shuyan was already ill. From his conversation, I learned that he became famous with the play "Asking the Woodcutter in the Mansion, Beating the Stick Out of the Box", and that his fatal illness was caused by the play "Fighting Taiping". I will briefly describe it below.

Yu Shuyan's first performance of "Asking the Woodcutter in the Mansion, Beating the Stick Out of the Box" is known in the most detail by Yu's friend Zhang Siye (Jifu). I will quote his words as follows: "In the early years of the Republic of China, Shuyan was singing in Shang Xiaoyun's troupe in a grain shop in Heyuan. One day, Xiaoyun had a hall meeting in Tianjin for three days. Shuyan wanted to take the lead alone, but he hesitated. Yu encouraged him to sing "Asking the Woodcutter in the Mansion, Beating the Stick Out of the Box". The play report was posted. On that day, Yu first arrived at the park and saw few listeners, so he was quite uneasy. He asked an old seat watcher, 'How do you think the audience will be tonight?' The seat watcher replied: "I can't say for sure. This year is the world of [花衫]Huashan and Qingyi, even if the [老闆]boss comes, it won't work." I was even more distressed when I heard this. If the play really didn't attract an audience, wouldn't I be hurting Shuyan? I went to Shuyan's house. Shuyan was practicing his voice and asked me how the audience in the park was. I replied that it was very good. After dinner, I went to Zhonghe Garden again. I entered from a long lane next to it. In the lane, I heard the [喧嘩]noise in the park. When I entered the park, I saw that it was crowded with people and it was already sold out, and I was very happy. Soon I saw Shuyan's face exposed from the side of the [幕]curtain on the stage, holding a [京八寸]Beijing eight-inch, which must have been very proud. On that day, Shuyan's voice was exceptionally [宏亮]loud, and his movements were extremely elegant. Shuanzi (Xia Changlin) and the woodcutter, Qian Jinfu and the evil spirit, were also very energetic. The sounds of [讚美]praise were endless. Shuyan became [唱紅]famous with this play, and Shang Xiaoyun was greatly surprised when he returned from Tianjin. From then on, he treated Shuyan differently." The above are the words of Zhang Siye, which show that it is not easy for a generation of artists to become famous.

Shuyan's signature play, in addition to "Asking the Woodcutter in the Mansion, Beating the Stick Out of the Box", was "Fighting Taiping". The last time Shuyan sang this play, he was fully dressed and ready to go on stage when he suddenly felt the urge to urinate. It took a long time to put on and take off the [紮靠]armor in this play. Shuyan relied on his strength and didn't want to miss the stage. Amidst the tense sound of the [鼓]drum, he still came out. After that, one scene was tighter than the other until he finished the play at one o'clock, and then he was able to relieve himself, already bloated to death. From then on, he was injured. Later, when he became seriously ill, he had to undergo surgery by a Western doctor to release urine. After the July 7th Incident, I was unable to travel north, so my friends in the capital wrote to me saying that Shuyan's illness was getting worse. Every time he urinated, he had to sit on the toilet for many minutes, releasing it drop by drop, which was extremely painful. Sometimes he even had to use a kind of tube. When the Japanese launched the Pacific War, American medicines and equipment were cut off. Shuyan used up the last "only tube" and died of this disease. It's really a pity.

The last time Shuyan took the stage was in 1935. The First Dance Hall outside Qianmen had a charity performance for disaster relief. Shuyan was specially invited to perform "Asking the Woodcutter in the Mansion, Beating the Stick Out of the Box". Coincidentally, I was in the capital and was able to witness the event. In the pool, I saw Ma Yunliang, Yi Xiaopei and Yu Yingfu and his son watching the play. Perhaps they were trying to learn something? Shuyan became famous with the play "Asking the Woodcutter in the Mansion, Beating the Stick Out of the Box", and he still used this play as his last masterpiece, which is really a coincidence.

### Time is Precious

— Hongxian

Time is money, this is a very common saying.

At present, I feel that the value of a day is unbelievably great.

For example, postal and tram tickets, water and electricity bills, differ by one day, and there will be differences in money by several times. Suppose someone manages to plan a sum of money and prepares to go out tomorrow. Who knows, when he wakes up, the market will be very different, which is really ridiculous.

I remember that in the past, the price increases of public utilities were often discussed again and again before a few prices were added. Later, it became a periodic price increase, but usually it started at the beginning of the month. Therefore, people are inevitably a little apprehensive about waiting until the end of January, but after all, there is still time to prepare. Now it's not like that. Often it is decided today and the price will increase tomorrow, which makes people feel caught off guard. From now on, I will be apprehensive after the end of each day.

I hope that the value of time will be limited to "one day" and not reach the degree of "an inch of time is precious". If it gets to the point where the price is discussed this hour and the price increases next hour, I am afraid that most people will only prepare to commit suicide.

### Golden Flower Notes

— Mingzhai

In 1947, Mexican President Alemán visited the United States and received a warm welcome from all levels of society. Wherever he went, cheers followed, truly making it the event of the moment. President Truman first held a grand banquet at the White House to welcome this distinguished guest; a few days later, President Alemán hosted a banquet at the Mexican Embassy in the United States, and Truman gladly accepted, fully demonstrating the friendship between the brotherly nations of the United States and Mexico.

However, a small tragicomedy was interspersed in this banquet!

The setting of this tragicomedy was, of course, the grand dining room of the Mexican Embassy in the United States, as mentioned above. That day, the dining room was decorated magnificently. Fresh flowers with rich fragrance were everywhere. A horseshoe-shaped long table was placed in the center of the hall, and the seats on both sides were painted gold. More than a hundred gentlemen and ladies who were invited to attend were all dressed up, and the sight of glittering jewelry was truly enviable.

In the middle of the banquet, President Truman stood up to toast the host and gave a short speech. According to the rules, everyone should stand up and toast...

The tragicomedy happened at this moment!

Just as the ladies and gentlemen in their soft evening gowns and the gentlemen in their stiff formal wear were about to stand up, a burst of rough "hissing" sounds suddenly filled the entire dining room! Some reserved male guests still strictly adhered to the etiquette in social situations and stood up to toast in a polite manner, while a small number of more curious guests couldn't help but secretly turn around to look at their own pants; the ladies, however, had already realized that something was wrong and were so anxious that they lost color in their faces!

And several counselors in the Mexican Embassy stared in dismay at the internationally renowned U.S. Senator Connally. It turned out that the old senator who laid the foundation for "bipartisan foreign policy," although he had stood up as required, was standing very awkwardly – the seat of the chair he was sitting on had become tightly united with his "rear," and Connally had stood up with his chair!

A few seconds later, the truth became clear. It turned out that the painter hired by the Mexican Embassy was particularly authentic. The repeated "gilding" of the chairs was indeed excellent, but the time was tight. Although it wasn't exactly "wet paint" during the banquet, at most it could only be said to be "newly dried paint." It just so happened that the weather was unusually hot that night, and very humid, which, combined, resulted in each chair being sticky, as if freshly coated with glue!

That day, whether male or female, everyone's "rear" was imprinted with a "golden flower" that slightly resembled a butterfly. Fortunately, both presidents had cushions on their seats, so they were spared the misfortune, which finally put the servants of the Mexican Embassy at ease after a moment of great panic.

### Northern City Chapter

— Shi Shufan

This was written when I, Yu, declined guests at the ancient city corner of Tiantai. The situation changed drastically, the righteous men were all scattered, the white azaleas withered, the person to be arrested had not returned. I was about to be summoned to the western capital, but I had no one to entrust my young children to. The heavens and the earth were in pain, and how could people bear it? The most difficult situation to resolve in my life was none other than this moment! Therefore, there is another line saying: "How can there be dreams of turning over on a dangerous bed? It is difficult to open the gate of death with both hands." "It is futile for the sun, moon, stars, and frost to change; I would willingly die if it were appropriate, but I am also anxious." It's just that now that things have passed, it's as if it were a dream, and I can barely bear to recall it!

I live in the northern city, have an official position but no property, and several mouths depend on meager income for survival. Why should I indulge in this life? I still hope to be of help in the restoration! Before I knew it, a year had passed, and my white teeth were falling out one after another. In the new spring, the atmosphere of war rose, and the hall lamp sent a message to the corners of the sea. What can I say about the magistrate's hard work? I must calm my heart and be diligent. (I went with Magistrate Meng Shujian six hundred miles into the mountains and earnestly asked Shao Lingzheng for assistance for my brother, and borrowed weapons and supplies.) My wife in the mountain village also entrusted me with state affairs. The wind carried secret orders, and the scorched earth was expected to turn green again! The sand has just begun to take shape, and the situation among the pines has changed. It is appropriate to restrain all thoughts, and good and evil are strictly watched. In the desolate northern city, the wheat is yellow and people's shadows are lonely. Although there are two children, one cooks and the other does chores. The young daughter is most pitiful, doing all the work of a servant. Her body is short, and the bucket is high; she can barely reach the well. Her face is often covered in soot, and the rice is often half-cooked. The young son is also not spoiled, helping to chop firewood. Sometimes he is greedy for play, and in the end, he resents his older sister. The two little ones do not know how to yield, and inevitably cry and weep. Seeing this, I cannot bear to scold them, and I taste joy amidst suffering. Alas, this absurd situation is truly a soul-destroying den! I raise my whip to encourage my declining will, and the wheels of the chariot roll outside the door.
