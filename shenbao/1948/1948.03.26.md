### The Legislative Yuan's 350th Regular Meeting Passes the Presidential Office Organization Act and Revises the Emergency Crime Punishment Act

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] The Legislative Yuan held its 350th regular meeting on the morning of the 25th, with President Sun Ke presiding. Major cases were discussed and passed as follows: (1) The draft of the Republic of China Presidential Office Organization Act; (2) Revision of Article 8 of the Emergency Crime Punishment Act during the Suppression of Rebellion Period (The revised article is as follows: "Article 8: Those who commit crimes under this Act, except for military personnel who shall be tried by military law, non-military personnel shall be tried by a special criminal court. The organization of the special criminal court in the preceding paragraph shall be determined separately."); (3) Regulations on the Organization of Special Criminal Courts (text published on page two); (4) Regulations on Trials in Special Criminal Courts (text published on page two). There are many other routine cases, which will be discussed at the Yuan's meeting next Tuesday.

Today's Legislative Yuan regular meeting began at 9:30 AM. First, Deputy Secretary-General Lou Tongsun read the minutes of the previous meeting. Then, Chairman Sun Ke announced a change in the agenda, advancing the discussion of the Presidential Office Organization Act draft. Liu Kebei, Chairman of the Legislative Committee, reported on the committee's special task force review of the draft, stating that the important revisions resulting from the review were roughly as follows: (1) The originally proposed General Office in the draft was deemed unnecessary and abolished; (2) Maintaining the principle of centralization, one Secretary-General is to be appointed to oversee all affairs of the Presidential Office; (3) Under the Secretary-General, there are to be six bureaus. The originally proposed Civil Affairs and Military Affairs Departments in the draft were abolished. There will be no Chief Civil Administrator. Instead, a Chief and Deputy Chief Military Counselor will handle military affairs; (4) Senior government advisors and advisors are renamed "State Advisors," emphasizing their high merit and prestige, distinguishing them from members of the National Policy and Strategic Advisory Committee. After Mr. Liu's report, the members began discussing the articles in order. Mr. Xia Taosheng advocated abolishing the Chief Military Counselor. President Sun Ke believed that since the President is the Commander-in-Chief of the nation's army, navy, and air force, and commands all national defense forces, there should be officials like a private Chief of Staff to assist him, such as the current White House Chief of Staff, Major General Lee Hai in the United States. The Chief Military Counselor should be retained. As for the Deputy Chief Military Counselor, it was decided by Chen Changheng's student, Zhang, not to establish such a position. In addition, the National History Museum and the National Father's Mausoleum Management Committee were also added as being subordinate to the Presidential Office. The issue of the Vice President was temporarily reserved. The full text of the amended and passed Republic of China Presidential Office Organization Act is recorded below:

### Reports of Sino-French Trade Agreement Are Inaccurate

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] Ministry of Foreign Affairs News: Since the signing of the new Sino-French Treaty in February 1935, the Ministry has held preliminary discussions with Mr. Mou, the former head of the French economic delegation, on the matter of negotiating a Sino-French commercial agreement. On February 18, 1936, a meeting was convened with relevant agencies to discuss the matter. It was generally agreed that France's desire to barter goods with us, under the current circumstances, could be achieved by both sides negotiating the free exchange of goods of equal value and mutual need at any time, without the need to separately establish an agreement. The Ministry conveyed this opinion to the French Embassy in March of last year. Reports that China and France have signed a commercial agreement are untrue and likely a misunderstanding in the rumors. As for the exchange of goods between China and Vietnam, it will still be handled according to the above-mentioned principles, depending on actual needs.

### The Ministry of Finance Explains That the Northeast Has Enough Currency for Supply

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] Reports say that the number of Northeast circulating notes issued may reach more than 50 billion, but there is a severe shortage of currency in Shenyang, Changchun, Jilin, and other places, resulting in the use of promissory notes. There is a huge difference between the cash held by various banks and the required expenditures. "Where did the circulating notes go?" There is a lot of concern outside. According to the Ministry of Finance news: The work of suppressing the rebellion in the nine provinces of the Northeast is underway, and military expenses are huge. Occasional shortages in the national bank's reserves are inevitable, resulting in a shortage of currency. However, supplies are now being transported continuously and are sufficient. As for the area in which the Northeast circulating notes are used, it was originally limited to the nine provinces of the Northeast. Due to military relations, they sometimes flow into the Pingjin area, but circulation is not allowed in Pingjin, and there is no impact on Guannei [areas south of the Great Wall].

### Northern Jiangsu Completes New Deployment; Command Posts Set Up Separately in Haimen and Jingjiang; New-Type Gunboats Patrol the River Surface

[Our Nantong Correspondent, 25th] The Communist bandits fleeing south in northern Jiangsu have slowed down after the National Army's continuous sweeps, and a certain elite force has been added to the defense, and the situation has slowed. The First Pacification Zone, in order to completely eliminate the bandits north of the Yangtze River and smash the bandit army's attempt to flee south across the river, has recently made new deployments, which are officially announced today.

### Prelude to the National Assembly: Vice Presidential Election Heats Up

The first National Assembly is about to open, marking the beginning of democratic politics. A new page is being turned in the history of the ancient Republic of China. People greet it with mixed feelings of joy and worry. We are happy that in this generation, we have finally stepped into the realm of democratic politics. We are worried, however, about this troubled country! While it may not be considered a miracle, it tells us that this is no ordinary event. A nation that has endured eight years of war against the enemy, followed by more than two years of continuous internal strife, amidst political, economic, and military turmoil, has managed to overcome all difficulties and advance the establishment of a democratic constitutional government. Today, the Constitution of the Republic of China has been in effect for three months, and we are convening the first National Assembly, exercising the rights we deserve and should enjoy as citizens of the Republic of China.

The powers of the National Assembly are to elect and recall the President and Vice President, and to amend the Constitution. However, this National Assembly is being held only three months after the implementation of the Constitution. The Constitution has just been implemented, so it is not possible to amend it immediately. Therefore, the main purpose of this National Assembly is clearly to elect the President and Vice President.

According to the Constitution, the President is the head of state, representing the Republic of China externally and commanding the national army, navy, and air force internally. The President has various decision-making powers, although some matters require the consent of relevant parties. However, the Vice President, whose position is second only to the President, has no specific provisions in the Constitution. All we can understand is that "the Vice President has no power when the President exercises his functions." According to Article 49 of the Constitution, the Vice President can only succeed or act on behalf of the President when the President is absent or unable to perform his duties. Therefore, the Vice President holds a prominent position, second only to the President, but his actual power is less than that of a department head. However, on the eve of the opening of the National Assembly, the feverish race for the Vice Presidency has already begun in the capital. Why is no one running for President? Just like the elections for National Assembly representatives, or for members of the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan, people only run for official positions and not for alternates. What is the reason for this? The ratio of official representatives to alternate representatives is no different from that of President to Vice President, because when an official representative is absent, the alternate representative will fill the position. Conversely, if the official representative is never absent, then the alternate representative will never be able to fill the position. This is the same as the Vice President having no power when the President is in office. However, on the eve of this election, those who intend to serve the country and the people have only chosen this empty position as their goal. This clearly shows the unanimous support of the entire nation for the current Chairman Chiang. They have hardly considered the need for anyone other than Chairman Chiang as the first President. The reporter once inquired about this issue to those who had already stated that they would be presidential candidates, and also sought the opinions of senior members of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party on the issue of presidential candidates. I can say that there was not a single different answer from people inside and outside the parties, and from all walks of life: "The President is naturally Chairman Chiang!" This includes many factors: Chairman Chiang is the leader who led the successful Northern Expedition, Chairman Chiang is the leader who led the War of Resistance and achieved victory, Chairman Chiang is the leader who led the people from military government to tutelage, and then to constitutional government. Chairman Chiang led the revolution, and he is the leader of democratic politics. Chairman Chiang is the most contributing leader in Chinese history. At the beginning of this constitutional government, it is natural not to abandon the founding mentor. This is one of the reasons.

At the same time, some people say, if we don't choose Chairman Chiang, who should we choose? Suppose we let the advanced members of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party be elected! But hardly anyone has thought, "Is there such a person in the other two parties whose talent and experience are higher than Chairman Chiang and who is more capable of this arduous task?" As for the Kuomintang itself, almost everyone handles their work under the influence of Chairman Chiang. They believe that listening to Chairman Chiang's instructions is the most unchangeable truth in the world. They believe and trust Chairman Chiang with one heart and one mind. They have not considered anyone other than Chairman Chiang. So who will be elected President? No one has considered it: "Of course, it's Chairman Chiang!" This contains respect and also implies a sense of rewarding merit. Because without the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang, how could we have the opportunity to hold the National Assembly and run for and be elected Vice President today!

Therefore, in the prelude to the election, the issue of presidential candidates has become a non-issue. Next is the vice presidential election. The first thing that can be reported here is that some hopeful candidates with enthusiasm for the election, when they have considered participating in the election, immediately have the idea "Shouldn't we listen to Chairman Chiang's instructions?" Almost regardless of whether they are within the party or not, this idea is based on trust and respect for the leader. However, this is just their idea. Chairman Chiang has not commented on "democracy." He is not prepared to control "democracy." He gives the greatest freedom to those who are about to participate in the election. Therefore, after this atmosphere spread, the vice presidential election campaign began.

The selection, identity, and nomination of vice presidential candidates are developing latently, like an undercurrent. There are different theories on whether the vice president should hold concurrent posts. It seems that some further discussion is necessary, but they resolutely launched their election campaigns in different ways. Up to today, the capital has been filled with a strong campaign atmosphere. Tea parties for the vice presidential candidates are taking place one after another. This battle seems to be quite heated. The reporter wants to say that there are currently five candidates in Nanjing. In terms of the division of civilian and military backgrounds, there are Yu Youren, Sun Ke, and Mo Dehui for the civilians, and Li Zongren and Cheng Qian for the military. In terms of party affiliation, only Mo Dehui is participating as a social leader. In terms of native place, Yu and Mo are from the north, and the rest are from the south. However, they each have their own strengths and confidence. They have started this first lesson in democracy based on the support of others or on their own initiative.
March 25th, from the capital

According to recent statistics, there are about 121,400 students in middle schools and above across the country who receive full public funding, and about 24,900 who receive half public funding, totaling about 145,000. Public funding increases with commodity prices, and the annual amount of funds required is difficult to estimate. Moreover, the number of people receiving public funding also changes at any time, with a tendency to increase rather than decrease. According to the situation in the most recent month, the highest full public funding per person has reached about 3 million yuan. Taking schools as a unit, the public funding item sometimes exceeds the total salaries and allowances of all teachers and staff, exceeding routine expenses and equipment expenses by more than ten or even dozens of times. Taking the national education funding as a unit, the estimated total public funding for the 36th year of the Republic (1947) was 50.4 billion, accounting for about 15% of the total education funding; the budgeted total public funding for the 37th year of the Republic (1948) is about 730 billion, accounting for about 25% of the total education funding. According to the Ministry of Education's instruction on March 14, "the current monthly expenditure for student public discussion fees will reach 100 billion yuan," which is much higher than the budget. This cannot be said to be a large expense.

The establishment of public funding began in the early years of the War of Resistance Against Japan. At that time, many schools were facing destruction, and students were either away from their hometowns and their sources of income were cut off, or although their homes were close to the school, they still had no ability to pay for their own education due to the impact of the war. In order to help displaced and poor youths, and to maintain education during the war, the government established public funding. In the extremely difficult economic conditions of the war, the government was actually able to make such long-term calculations. Its painstaking efforts are admirable. At that time, in addition to cultivating talents, there was another purpose, which was not to allow the next generation of Chinese masters to stay in the occupied areas and be ravaged or used by the enemy and puppets. Therefore, the establishment of public funding has both educational and political meanings. On the one hand, it is education, and on the other hand, it is cultivation. Judging from the results of the nine years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the effectiveness of both aspects is quite considerable: we have cultivated some useful talents and also rescued many youths who might have fallen into enemy-occupied areas.

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the economic situation of ordinary families was worse than before, and the public funding system had to be maintained. However, the number of students increased day by day, and the government also felt that the burden was becoming heavier day by day. Therefore, starting from the new students last year, public funding was changed to scholarships, and the number of scholarships was limited to only 20% of the total number of new students. However, as far as the current situation is concerned, those who have already received public funding continue to receive it as before. In addition to scholarships, there are also disaster relief funds for communist areas, public funding for demobilized youth soldiers, and grants for the children of war heroes. Therefore, in fact, most students still rely on national support. The purpose of this support is still the same as during the War of Resistance Against Japan, with both educational cultivation and political acceptance.

Judging from the situation in the one or two years after the restoration, the impact of the public funding system on the youth at school can be said to be both good and bad. The good is undeniable. The lifeline of education depends on it, and some outstanding and poor children do rely on it to achieve something in their studies. The bad is also unavoidable. Wealthy children occupy the places of poor children, waste public funds, and cunning and unscrupulous people receive double public funds from different schools or fraudulently receive public funds. Some people occupy public funding and regard schools as hotels or sanatoriums. The most common phenomenon is that they regard public funding as something they deserve, and few people remember that this is the price of the blood and sweat of ordinary people who are poorer than themselves. They still complain every day, without thinking that ordinary people are even more miserable than they are. Even their teachers are not as well off as they are in terms of special treatment. For example, taking Beiping as an example, a professor with a family of four or five can only receive at most 10 million, which is slightly more than that, while a full public funding recipient receives more than 3 million. The children of professors have to pay tuition to enter school.

Generally speaking, the opinions of most people in the education community are consistent. Under the current social and economic conditions, outstanding and poor children still have to rely on the power of the state to cultivate them, and the public funding or scholarship system must be maintained. However, the method must be improved. The state's cultivation should be limited to outstanding and poor students. We should not waste the people's hard-earned money indiscriminately and without a plan to subsidize naughty and profligate people. The current method gives the impression that it is more about cultivation than education, and even the cultivation does not achieve the government's purpose of cultivation. To put it bluntly, the purpose of cultivation is to prevent young students from rebelling. If they are raised but not educated, the recipients will inevitably rebel.

But the most serious problem is not this, but that raising cannot raise them for a lifetime. Students will eventually graduate and leave school. As far as the current actual situation is concerned, graduation is equivalent to unemployment, which is equivalent to cutting off support. This group of young students has received a very high level of education and has very high ideals. As soon as they leave school, you tell them that they have no use for what they have learned. Their ideals are shattered. Can you expect them to stand obediently on the hunger line forever? Therefore, I thought of Su Dongpo's article on "Warring States Knights." He said that the custom of raising talents was very popular in the Warring States period, "Those who worked hard to serve the superiors were all clumsy and incompetent. Even if they wanted to rebel, they would be the first to do so." Therefore, the six countries did not perish quickly, and Qin perished quickly because "the outstanding people were scattered and returned to the fields." He raised such a question:

"Where do those who ate at the hands of the Four Lords and Lu Buwei and others (Note: those who received support) all go (Note: after the support is cut off)? I don't know if they can cough and sigh and die in coarse clothes (Note: die in poverty)? Or will they sigh and use the people's time (Note: like Chen Sheng and Wu Guang rebelling)!"

This topic still has its importance now and is worth thinking about for those who talk about governance and power.

Even if we put aside political power struggles, we also have to ask: we spend so much material and human resources to cultivate so many students. There must be a purpose. What is the purpose of raising them but not using them? Unemployment and cutting off support are not only a major disaster for the youth themselves, but also a major loss for the country and society. Needless to say, this youth unemployment problem must be solved as soon as possible. We would like to offer three suggestions on this:

First, the reason for unemployment is that the government has no plan for the future of school graduates. Education should adapt to the needs of the current environment and prepare what kind of bricks and tiles to build what kind of houses. We should consider what kind of undertakings the country has to do now, how many talents are needed, and then train the talents needed for those undertakings step by step. Only by measuring output based on input can we achieve the two major principles of "everyone has something to do" and "people have something to do." At present, we are just copying personnel matters, setting up universities indiscriminately, and producing a large number of students who are not very suitable, sending them out of school, and considering that they have delivered the goods and unloaded the responsibility. This is aimless education. How can aimless education be effective?

Second, many young people are unemployed not because of an oversupply of talent, but because of the stagnation of all industries. For example, in medicine, if the country wants to modernize and rationalize medical and health facilities, the number of medical personnel that can be used is still far from the actual needs. Because the country has not started to develop medical and health facilities at all, it is calling people who study medicine to have nothing to do in China, where doctors are most lacking. This contradictory phenomenon is the same in every public undertaking. There is a shortage of engineers, but engineers have nothing to do. There is a shortage of teachers, but teachers have nothing to do. The solution is of course the development of public undertakings. Due to the continuation of the war, there are certainly many difficulties in developing public undertakings, but it is not absolutely impossible. Schools can be maintained, so why can't other institutions be maintained? It is not entirely a matter of funding. The most important thing is planning, organization, and driving force. If you are at a loss, things will naturally stop, and people will naturally be idle.

Third, many young people are unemployed, partly because there is no reasonable method for the appointment and elimination of civil servants. Government agencies are as numerous as hairs, and redundant personnel in agencies are as numerous as hairs. The positions where things can be done are occupied by some incompetent people, so young and talented people have no way to intervene. A reasonable method is to strictly implement a performance appraisal system within the agency, and those who should be laid off should be laid off; strictly implement an examination system outside the agency, and those who can fill vacancies should fill them. Doing so can not only eradicate malpractices such as sneaking in through connections and relying on power, but also solve part of the unemployment problem, and also improve administrative efficiency and encourage the efforts and progress of ordinary citizens.

In the blink of an eye, it will be the summer vacation, and another large group of graduates will be leaving school to find work. The unemployment problem will become more serious day by day. We hope that the political and educational authorities can understand the seriousness of this problem and come up with a solution as soon as possible.

### Director Zhang Reports on the Current Economic Situation. The Powers of the Price Stabilization Committee are Partially Strengthened. Import of Nineteen Kinds of Chemical Products is Prohibited. One Hundred Million US Dollars is Enough to Recover All Legal Tender.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] The Full Economic Council held its regular meeting on the afternoon of the 25th. Chairman Zhang Qun first gave a detailed report on the general economic situation, particularly emphasizing that under the current circumstances, it is not appropriate to change the foreign exchange policy rashly. If any of the committee members have any opinions, they can directly suggest them to me, and I will adopt feasible ones for implementation. Director Zhang also analyzed the possibility of US aid, saying that it could be decided after the US Congress passes it in early June. Although the numbers passed by the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee and the House of Representatives are different, I believe that this time we should not be disappointed. After the success of US aid, it should still be used in conjunction with the ten self-help plans I have drafted. Regarding stabilizing the value of legal tender and enhancing its credibility, the Executive Yuan is currently studying specific measures based on the resolution of the State Council. Zhang also mentioned the issue of whether or not to publish the number of legal tender issued, and pointed out that the number issued is not as large as rumored outside. As long as there is 100 million US dollars, all legal tender can be recovered. The success of US aid should have a good impact on prices. Prices are already trending downward. What is currently concerning is the problem of workers' cost of living index, which is increasing monthly. Factories already feel unable to bear it. The problem is quite serious. I hope that labor and management can understand and understand each other and seek a reasonable solution. I also hope that all committee members will study more and provide good opinions. The powers of the Full Economic Council are not strong enough. Whether from a theoretical or practical point of view, all economic institutions, such as the Fuel Control Committee, the Textile Adjustment Committee, and the Post-War Rehabilitation Committee, should all be subordinate to the Full Economic Council before the government's economic policies can be smoothly implemented. The powers of the Full Economic Council must be strengthened in the future. Zhang's report lasted half an hour. Then, Gu Yuzhu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Council, reported on the recent reasons for the decline in prices. Then, Committee Member Shi Kuiling reported on the economic situation in North China and made recommendations, which Director Zhang instructed to be submitted to relevant agencies for research. Finally, the committee members discussed three proposals, which are recorded separately as follows: (1) Proposal to stabilize prices: Because prices are currently trending downward, no specific discussion was held on the price stabilization measures proposed in the past. We will wait and see the trend of prices, and only put forward the calculation formula for the price increase of eleven kinds of daily necessities proposed by the Secretariat for discussion, and decided to implement it first for five kinds of daily necessities: coal, rice, wheat, silk, and cotton cloth. The above-mentioned calculation formula for the price increase of the five kinds of daily necessities will be submitted to relevant agencies for detailed research, and then submitted to the meeting for discussion. (2) Proposal on how to strengthen the powers of the Price Stabilization Committee: After the Secretariat convenes a small group of committees for review, it will be submitted to the meeting for discussion again, and Wang Yunwu, Chen Qitian, Weng Wenhao, Yu Hongjun, Yu Feipeng and others will be appointed to organize a small group meeting for review. (3) Proposal on the import of two chemical products in Annex 2 of the import trade for the fifth and sixth quarters: passed according to the review opinions. Chemical products that can be manufactured domestically are prohibited from import, and those whose domestic production quantity is not enough are restricted from import, so as to save foreign exchange. Nineteen of the forty-seven chemical products are not allowed to be imported, and nine are allowed to be partially imported. In the seventh quarter, these nine will also not be allowed to be imported. Imported chemical products will be distributed to factories as much as possible and to importers as little as possible.

Shi Kuiling Reports on the Economy of North China

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] Shi Kuiling, Director of the Tianjin Financial Administration and Committee Member of the Full Economic Council, presented a report on the economic investigation of North China Pingjin at the Full Economic Council on the 25th. In addition to the written report, Shi also gave an oral report. Its content is divided into four parts: transportation, industry and mining, finance, and import and export trade. He pointed out that the reasons for the economic depression in the north are: A. Difficult environment, B. Difficult transportation, C. Shrinking production, D. Financial exhaustion. Therefore, in the future, special attention should be paid to increasing production of materials, restoring transportation, and stabilizing prices.

### Joint Board of Directors

Industrial and Mining Loans for National Policy Portion Approved for 193 Billion

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] The industrial and mining loan plan proposed by the Resources Committee, totaling 472 billion yuan, divided into national policy loans, business loans, and order loans, was approved by the Joint Board of Directors on the 25th. The national policy portion of the loan is 193 billion yuan, and the remaining portion will be handled according to the circumstances.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] The land development company to be established by the China Farmers Bank, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Ministry of Land Affairs, in accordance with Chairman Chiang's instructions, had its funding loan of 50 billion yuan approved by the Joint Board of Directors on the 25th. In the past, Chairman Chiang had a hand-written order saying "All barren mountains, forests, public fields, and public lands nationwide should be handed over to the China Farmers Bank for speedy development and use." The China Farmers Bank then formulated a plan to establish a company based on this order. After review by a small group meeting of relevant agencies, it was submitted to the China Farmers Bank, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Ministry of Land Affairs for preparation.

When the Joint Board of Directors held its regular meeting on the 25th, it also passed (1) The Tanggu New Port project fee loan of 60 billion yuan expired at the end of March. After review, it was decided to extend it for three months and increase the loan by 30 billion yuan. (2) The Longhai Railway loan of 10 billion yuan expired at the end of March and was approved for a three-month extension. Other railway loans are still under study. The issue of dividing silk loans was discussed for a long time at the meeting. Some argued that it should belong to national policy loans, while others argued that it should be stricter than business loans. It was decided that relevant agencies would hold a small group meeting in Shanghai on the 27th for discussion, and submit it to the next board meeting for discussion.

### Sun Ke Answers Reporters' Questions

(Continued from page 1) After Sun's report, he answered questions from reporters separately. Regarding foreign policy, Sun said: China is an independent country, and its foreign policy is an independent policy. From the standpoint of the country, all countries that are friendly to us and can abide by treaties and maintain our complete territorial sovereignty are our friends; otherwise, they should be treated differently. Someone asked for his opinion on civilian rule and military rule. Sun replied: In peacetime, it is always civilian rule, and military rule is a situation in extraordinary times. Regarding whether Sun would continue to concurrently serve as the Speaker of the Legislative Yuan if he were elected, Sun replied: The fact has not yet occurred. The Constitution does not stipulate that the Vice President cannot concurrently serve as the Speaker of the Legislative Yuan. The Constitution only stipulates that members of the Legislative Yuan cannot concurrently serve as officials. It seems that all those elected by the people are not officials, such as the President, Vice President, members of the Legislative Yuan and Control Yuan, the Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, and the President of the Police Academy are not officials. Regarding the issue of Sun's nomination for election, Sun replied that if party nomination is adopted, then the Kuomintang should first decide on a candidate. If I am the candidate, then there is no problem. If the party decides on someone other than me, then I will abide by the party's order and no longer nominate myself for election. Conversely, if the party does not intend to nominate a candidate, then I can nominate myself to participate in the election freely. At this point, someone asked whether Sun was canvassing votes from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party. He replied that if the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party each nominate candidates, then we should not canvass votes from those parties. If neither party nominates a candidate, then I would naturally welcome their votes to elect me. Regarding election expenses, Sun said: In order to respect the sacred vote of the National Assembly representatives, I will not use a single cent. Someone speculated that if Sun were elected and the President was unable to perform his duties due to an incident, and he were to act on behalf of the President, could the position of Speaker of the Legislative Yuan be held concurrently? He replied that if he were acting on behalf of the President, he could no longer return to the Legislative Yuan, and the Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Yuan could act on his behalf, or he could be re-elected. Someone asked why he did not run for President. Sun replied that we support Chairman Chiang in running for President. As an official, I should support the leader of the party.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 25th] Regarding whether the National Assembly session will be extended due to the failure to resolve some disputes and the insufficient number of registered representatives, someone raised a question at Sun Ke's press conference on the 25th. Sun replied that it would depend on whether the number of registered representatives on the eve of the opening of the National Assembly meets the legal quorum. The Preparatory Committee of the National Assembly has no right to decide on an extension.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th Dispatch] National professional women's organizations jointly nominated Fu Xiaofeng and Qiu Yingguang, who were elected as National Representatives. Considering they received the most votes, they should legally be elected. However, the election office for national professional women's organizations, based on "party membership priority methods," announced them as alternates. Claiming that this announcement was made under the orders of the General Election Office, they filed a lawsuit with the Capital High Court, naming Wei Qiongying and Li Baoping, nominated by political parties but elected as alternates, as the first defendants, and Zhang Lisheng, Chairman of the General Election Office, as the second defendant. The court has scheduled a hearing for the 27th of this month.

### Jin Bihui Executed by Firing Squad

(Continued from Page 1) Jin Bihui, a notorious international female spy, was a mysterious figure in life, and her death also contained a strong sense of mystery. The execution was carried out in absolute secrecy. With the exception of one reporter from an American magazine, all Chinese reporters were barred from the entrance. Therefore, the truth of the execution is unclear. Later, a female corpse was left at the back door of the First Prison on Ziqiang Road, purportedly the body of Jin Bihui.

Face Covered in Blood

Prison officials guided reporters to view the body at 7:30 this morning. The body lay with its head to the south and feet to the north, dressed in a gray prison uniform, with blue wool pants and a red wool sweater underneath. The bullet entered from the back of the head and exited through the bridge of the nose. The hair was disheveled, and the face was covered in blood, making it impossible to identify. Jin Bihui's crimes were serious, and she was the first major traitor to be executed in Pingjin. Therefore, the Hebei High Court Prosecutor's Office attached great importance to this matter. At 5:00 AM on the 25th, they notified various newspapers and news agencies, inviting reporters to the scene to report on the circumstances of the execution to the public. In addition, the China Electric Third Factory was invited to the scene to film the event. Reporters from various newspapers arrived in advance, but unexpectedly were suddenly refused entry. The guards threw out all the reporters' business cards from a small door, claiming: "The Warden does not allow entry." Afterwards, reporters from various newspapers, due to the strange turn of events, have jointly filed a serious protest with the High Court Prosecutor's Office and the prison through the Journalists Association for External Affairs of Industry and Commerce.

Two Letters

[Our Beiping Office, 25th Dispatch] The Hebei High Court Prosecutor's Office announced that Jin Bihui had written two letters before her execution: (1) To Father (referring to her adoptive father, the Japanese Naniwa Kawashima): I was finally executed on the morning of March 25th. Please tell the young people to pray unceasingly for the future of China, and please go to my late father's grave and tell him about China, and that I will also serve China in the next life. (2) To the Warden, Section Chief, Guard Zhao, and Mr. Cai: Thank you for your kindness during my life. I really didn't expect to die without changing my clothes. My family's feelings towards me are like this; there's no need to say anything else. Jin Bihui.

### US Military Leaders Propose Plan to Expand Forces and Strengthen National Defense; Requesting Military Spending Increase to $24 Billion

[Our Dispatch] New York, 25th Broadcast: Washington Dispatch, Today, US military leaders urged Congress to immediately expand the armed forces and conscript young people aged 19 to 25. Secretary of Defense Forrestal stated that the current situation is still favorable to peace and the free nations of the world, but he urged Congress to immediately approve the following: (1) Increase the currently authorized strength of the Army, Navy, and Air Force by 349,500 personnel; (2) Allocate an additional $3 billion to meet the needs of this military expansion effort, given that the current budget for national defense is $11 billion; (3) Conscript young people aged 19 to 25, which would provide 1,355,000 people, but only 220,000 may be needed; (4) Establish a permanent system of universal military training, to be completed within three years, which would produce approximately 850,000 people annually with basic military training. As for other details, Forrestal believes that due to "the world situation," a report must be submitted in a closed session. Forrestal vigorously emphasized the urgency of strengthening national defense to deter the Soviet Union. Of the troop increases he proposed, the Army would receive 240,000 personnel, the Navy 63,000, the Marine Corps 11,000, and the Air Force 35,500. The current actual strength of the US military is 1,392,000, while the authorized maximum strength is 1,732,000. Of the requested increase in military spending, he proposed $775 million for the Air Force and aircraft manufacturing and research, approximately $76 million for military personnel, and the remainder to cover miscellaneous expenses.

[Our Dispatch] New York, 25th Broadcast: Washington Dispatch, A senior Treasury Department official stated today that if tax revenues are not reduced, then increasing spending by $20-30 billion for military preparations will not have a major impact on the US economy. However, he also said that if spending is three or four times greater than this figure, then it will be necessary to restore controls, perhaps even greater in scope than wartime controls, to prevent inflation. In addition, tax rates must also be increased. In other words, in addition to the rationing, price controls, and other controls implemented during World War II, it will also be necessary to forcibly conscript workers for essential jobs. He said that the government's plan to prepare militarily to prevent Soviet expansion is still under study.

[Associated Press, Washington, 24th Dispatch] The US Air Force Department announced today that it will continue to recruit 25,000 new soldiers. A week ago, the department announced that the Air Force strength had reached 312,000 and that it did not intend to continue recruiting. Today, it suddenly changed its plan to recruit 337,000 soldiers, and the ban on married soldiers enlisting has also been lifted. It is rumored that the Air Force Department will ask Congress to approve the expansion of the Air Force to 450,000 or 500,000 officers and soldiers. In other words, the current 55 squadrons must be expanded to 70 squadrons. A bill was introduced in the House of Representatives today advocating that the Air Force establish 70 combat squadrons, 22 special squadrons, and 27 National Defense Air Force squadrons and at least 34 Air Force Reserve squadrons.

[Associated Press, San Francisco, 25th Dispatch] Rear Admiral Noble, Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance, stated today that since the end of World War II, US naval ordnance has constantly been innovating and is now unparalleled in the world. The accuracy of warships' anti-aircraft guns hitting enemy aircraft has increased by more than 50% compared to the end of the war, and they can respond to orders in the event of an emergency.

### US Supplies Continuously Shipped to the Soviet Union; Congressional Members Express Outrage; Truman Issues Statement Explaining

[Our Dispatch] New York, 25th Broadcast: Washington Dispatch, Congress is extremely outraged by the shipment of US supplies to the Soviet Union. Today, President Truman said at a press conference that the Soviet Union is currently a friendly country, and most of the cargo being shipped is from contracts signed two years ago.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th Dispatch] Peter Petersen, Director of the Munitions Division of the Department of State, stated that President Truman will issue a statement soon, severely restricting the shipment of aircraft parts and other important war materials to the Soviet Union and its satellite countries.

[Associated Press, Washington, 25th Dispatch] The shipment of American aircraft engines and other materials to the Soviet Union amid the tense global situation is causing great public outrage in Congress. House Investigating Committee Chairman Rizley stated that the following three actions will now be taken: (1) Request the Department of Commerce to completely stop shipping US materials to the Soviet Union and its vassal states. (2) Immediately investigate whether cargo boxes destined for the Soviet Union are piled up at the New York docks. (3) Thoroughly investigate the situation of the Moore-McCormack Lines shipping company in New York, which is transporting materials for the Soviet purchasing agency.

Committee investigators have gone to the shipping company to examine the books and will investigate the loading of cargo in New York Harbor by 60 ships flying the Soviet flag since January 1.

Anderson, Deputy Director of the Office of International Resources of the Department of State, testified before the House Investigating Committee yesterday that the Department of State has not yet formulated a shipping policy that distinguishes between friendly and unfriendly countries. The committee members were greatly shocked to hear this. Rizley also stated that Surplus Property Administrator Larsen had reported to him that yesterday he received an order to freeze all surplus aircraft, aircraft equipment, and parts within the United States and prohibit their export. However, other officials of the bureau said that they were unaware of this order. Rizley then explained to reporters that perhaps the Army and Navy authorities now want to retain the surplus aircraft to see how the world situation changes. "However, it is too ridiculous to supply Uncle Stalin with military materials at a time when we need them so much." New York Congressman Celler also shared this sentiment. It is said that it is heartbreaking to see materials related to our survival being shipped to the Soviet Union.

### Proposals for Universal Military Training: Mrs. Roosevelt Endorses, Einstein Opposes

[U.S. News Bureau, Washington, 24th Dispatch] Mrs. Roosevelt and Einstein have expressed differing opinions regarding the proposal for universal military training submitted to the Senate Military Affairs Committee today. As the Military Affairs Committee continued its public hearing on the issue of universal military training, a letter from workers was read aloud and included in the record. Mrs. Roosevelt stated in her letter that she had previously opposed universal military training, and said, "But at present, I no longer oppose universal military training, because I believe this stance is sufficient to make the Soviet Union understand our goal of maintaining strength, until the United Nations can establish a force sufficient to control any aggression, and all countries can gradually reduce their armaments." Einstein stated in his letter that universal military training would accelerate the arms race, increase tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and thus increase the danger of war. "In my opinion, the use of compulsory military training is only necessary and reasonable in the foreseeable future if there is a threat of hostile invasion of American territory. I believe that this kind of threat does not currently exist."

Another witness against universal military training was Linfield, the newly appointed Veterans Advisory Committee member of the National Wallace for President Committee. He read a statement, saying that it was prepared by many other people. Dr. Kang Yuzhen, a Nobel Prize winner and nuclear physicist who helped invent the atomic bomb, strongly urged the passage of universal military training legislation.

### U.S. Tax Reduction Bill

Passed by Both Houses, Sent to the President for Signature

[Reuters, Washington, 24th Dispatch] The House of Representatives today passed an income tax reduction bill, which will reduce income taxes for 52 million taxpayers nationwide and exempt 7.4 million low-income people from income tax. The bill will now be submitted to President Truman for approval. It is expected that the President will veto it, and then it will be sent back to the two houses for reconsideration. If it is passed again by a two-thirds majority, it will become law.

### Panama Strictly Prevents Spies

[United Press, Panama City, 25th Dispatch] A spokesperson for the Panamanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently stated that many Soviet people in China have requested passports to reside in or transit through Panama. The government is now taking strict measures to prevent Soviet spies or saboteurs from arriving at the Panama Canal. The spokesperson said that there have been no reports of sabotage or espionage activities yet, but there is concern that once this group of Soviet citizens arrives in Panama, "they will be reluctant to return home, or purchase permanent property with the help of unscrupulous agents."

### Italy is Willing to Negotiate Directly with Yugoslavia on the Trieste Issue, but Must Be Based on the Suggestions of the Three Powers

[United Press, Rome, 25th Dispatch] The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that Italy is prepared to begin direct negotiations with Yugoslavia on the Trieste port "within the spirit and letter of the Western countries' suggestions." A spokesperson reiterated the Italian government's belief that maintaining peace between Italy and Yugoslavia is impossible before the Trieste issue is resolved. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that Italy and Yugoslavia have reached an agreement that due to changes in the treaty boundaries, Yugoslavs in the Venezia Giulia region, which has been incorporated into Yugoslavia, will be exchanged with Slavs remaining in Italian territory. "The Italian government is extremely pleased with this agreement, and a joint Italian-Yugoslav communiqué will be issued in the coming days to announce the details of the agreement."

[Reuters, London, 24th Dispatch] Foreign Secretary Bevin stated in the House of Commons today that the decision of the British, American, and French to recommend the return of Trieste to Italy was not motivated by the Italian general election. In response to a question from Labour MP Trevelyan, he pointed out that as early as the signing of the peace treaty with Italy, it was discussed that after the withdrawal of troops from the Trieste area four months after the signing of the treaty, the issue of returning Trieste to Italy would be raised again. However, the issue of return was not raised because the agreement to establish a free zone was not reached. Recently, in order to break the deadlock, Britain, the United States, and France decided to recommend the return of Trieste to Italy. Events in recent months have shown that the regulations for establishing the Trieste Free Zone cannot be implemented. The governments of the three countries believe that the only solution, from both a political and economic point of view, is to return Trieste to Italy. The three countries are not pessimistic about reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union on this matter. If an agreement can be reached, the next step will be to submit a report to the United Nations.

### Communist Demonstration in Trieste, Yugoslavia Closes Border

[Reuters, Trieste, 24th Dispatch] A communist-organized demonstration against the return of Trieste to Italy was held here today, with more than 4,000 participants. An Italian demonstration originally planned in Gorizia to oppose the cession of the Gorizia province to Yugoslavia was canceled at the last minute.

[Reuters, London, 24th Dispatch] A dispatch from Paris states that the border between Yugoslavia and the Trieste Free Zone has been closed by the authorities.

[United Press, Trieste, 24th Dispatch] A British military spokesperson said today that British troops continue to be deployed to areas near the Yugoslav border in Trieste to be on alert.

### Wallace Criticizes U.S. Policy Toward Italy

[Reuters, Paris, 25th Dispatch] U.S. third-party presidential candidate Wallace wrote an article for the left-leaning French independent newspaper "Franc-Tireur," stating that the policy the U.S. could adopt in Italy is sufficient to cause war. He said that the price paid by the U.S. Democratic and Republican groups for the Italian election broke the price paid for elections in any country in the world. Such policies by the U.S. are tantamount to rushing down the slope of intermittent warfare. President Truman has launched a period of warmongering so that he can declare a national emergency. The U.S. government is headed by those who call on peace-loving nations to resist Soviet aggression. They plan to make China a police state wearing a mask to ensure control over the world. While capitalist profits are soaring, they are attempting to prohibit union demands for wage increases, and capitalist profiteering is due to military subsidies given by the government.

### U.S. Studies Secret Plan to Encourage Anti-Communist Underground Work Behind the Iron Curtain, First Hinted at in Bridges' Words

[Report from This Newspaper] New York, 25th Broadcast: Washington News, It is learned that Congress is currently studying the allocation of several million dollars to carry out a secret plan to encourage non-communists to conduct underground work behind the Iron Curtain, and it is rumored that several diplomatic and military officials have been assigned to be responsible for this work. This news was first hinted at in the words of Bridges, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who said that the United States should encourage underground activities behind the Iron Curtain to shake the tyranny of the regions that have already been conquered by communism. It is said that this plan will be handled by the State Department, and the necessary funds will be provided to Secretary of State Marshall.

[United Press, Washington, 24th Dispatch] Senator Bridges, Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, suddenly launched a lightning-like attack on the U.S. government's post-war policy toward the Soviet Union, criticizing some Republicans for following the bipartisan policy. Bridges criticized the Republican and Democratic parties for adopting so-called "soap bubble diplomacy." He said that the U.S. foreign policy after the war has been wavering and unstable. He called for the immediate approval of the seventeen-point military and economic mobilization plan to deal with the threat of the Soviet Union's world "conspiracy." These seventeen points include: (1) Domestic communists in the United States must register immediately; (2) Federal government officials who are negligent in prevention should be dismissed; (3) Strengthening U.S. foreign bases, supplementing military shortages, and increasing the strength of the army, navy, and air force.

### Clayton Rumored to be Appointed as General Manager of the Aid to Europe Program

[Reuters, Washington, 24th Dispatch] Former Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Clayton is rumored to be appointed as the general manager of the European Recovery Program with an annual salary of $20,000. Mr. Clayton was the head of the U.S. delegation to the Havana International Trade and Employment Conference, and he resigned from his position as Deputy Secretary of State due to poor health last autumn to attend the conference in Havana. The general manager of the European Recovery Program has the same rank as a cabinet member, and there are 500 staff members in Washington and 400 staff members abroad.

### U.S. House of Representatives Continues to Discuss Unified Foreign Aid Bill

Hoover Expresses Approval of the Entire Bill

[Central News Agency, Washington, 25th Dispatch] Former U.S. President Hoover approved of the foreign aid bill drafted by the House of Representatives, which includes economic and military aid to China. In a letter to House Speaker Martin requesting advice, Mr. Hoover said that aid to Greece, Turkey, and China are the most beneficial provisions in the House bill.

### U.S. Sharply Criticizes Soviet Union at Conference on Freedom of Information; General Assembly Breaks into Groups to Study How to Ensure Freedom of the Press

[Reuters, Geneva, 25th Dispatch] Former Assistant Secretary of State Brandon, the U.S. representative, strongly criticized the Soviet Union at the plenary session of the International Conference on Freedom of Information today. He said that the worst conspirators in wartime acts and false guidance are those who monopolize the news media privately or by the government, and the more severe the monopoly of the news media, the more untrue the reports are. The accusations against the American press at the United Nations General Assembly session last September were clearly directed at the wrong target. The accusing finger should be pointed towards the East, not towards the free press of America. However, just four weeks ago, freedom was declared dead in Czechoslovakia, just 500 miles from Geneva. In other countries not far away, we have also seen freedom dying one after another. These events have made people all over the world who cherish human dignity, freedom of thought, and national independence feel terrified.

Brandon continued: This conference may not be able to reach an agreement on the entire agenda, but if it can establish some principles and clarify the relationship between freedom of the press and peace, then our work will not have been in vain.

[United Press, Geneva, 25th Dispatch] Brandon announced the U.S. plan at the meeting: (1) Seek an international agreement that stipulates methods for gathering and transmitting news that are not subject to arbitrary national restrictions; (2) Support all proposals that promote the right of people and news agencies in all countries to receive, publish, broadcast, and disseminate news by other means; (3) Review various suitable ways to develop the technological equipment, newspapers, radio, etc. of various countries, and expand the people's sources of news; (4) Hope that the proposed United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and Charter can strictly support freedom of speech and publication.

[Reuters, Geneva, 24th Dispatch] The Yugoslav delegation to the International Conference on Freedom of Information issued a statement today, requesting that anyone who controls information agencies should be held legally responsible for any defamatory lies and rumors that incite war that they release. The Yugoslav delegation pointed out that newspapers and information tools in many countries have become the monopoly of a few giants, who speak for the personal interests they represent. American capitalists, with their material capabilities, have prevented the United States from having a free press. It is learned that the British delegation will submit affirmative proposals to 56 countries to guarantee freedom of the press. Delegates to the General Assembly have formed a four-price committee to study various issues to ensure freedom of the press. It is expected that conflicts will occur in the committee between various factions with different ideas about freedom. Professor Huxley, Chairman of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, addressed the General Assembly and urged delegates to abandon doctrines and theories and deal with practical problems. He put forward four major points: (1) Prevent news transmission tools from being monopolized by a few people; (2) Equal enjoyment of news transmission tools; (3) Sharing of technical methods of transmission tools; (4) The sense of responsibility of those who use modern transmission tools.

### British MPs Jointly Propose a Summit of the Three Giants to Save the International Crisis

[Reuters, London, 24th Dispatch] Labour MP Cox, Labour leftist leader Crossman, and 16 others submitted a motion to the House of Commons today, requesting that Stalin, Truman, and Attlee, as well as Commonwealth leaders such as South African Prime Minister Smuts and Indian Governor-General Mountbatten, hold talks in order to seek an understanding with the Soviet Union. The motion expresses grief over the rapid deterioration of the international situation, and expresses support for Prime Minister Smuts' speech on Friday, advocating seeking an understanding with the Soviet Union.

### Chief Delegate of Venezuela Dies

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 25th United Press] The International Conference on Freedom of Information recently announced that the chief delegate of Venezuela to the conference, Fang Bona, died of a heart attack last night. Everyone stood up in silence for one minute to express condolences.

### U.S. State Department Denies Rumors

Denies Secret Agreement Between U.S. and France

[Reuters, Washington, 24th Dispatch] The Secretary of State today solemnly denied the Moscow radio's claim that the United States and France had signed a secret agreement allowing the United States to use French air force bases. Moscow Radio said the agreement was signed in February.

### U.S. to Propose in the Security Council Holding a Truce Conference in the Holy Land, President Truman Announces to Reporters

[Report from This Newspaper] New York, 25th Broadcast: Washington News, President Truman announced at a press conference today that the United States will recommend that the United Nations convene a truce conference of Arab and Jewish leaders to stop the war in Palestine. He said that U.S. Representative to the United Nations Austin Jiang will submit the proposal to the Security Council. Truman said he still supports the partition plan, but to cope with the situation after the withdrawal of British troops, he advocates temporary UN trusteeship.

[Reuters, London, 24th Dispatch] British Colonial Secretary Jones told a reporter from this agency that Britain has decided to hand over the trusteeship of Palestine on May 15, and will completely withdraw British troops stationed in Palestine by August 1 at the latest. Regardless of the outcome of the United Nations discussions, Britain will not change this decision.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 24th Dispatch] France and Canada stated in the Security Council today that at the current stage, the two countries cannot support the U.S. proposal to establish a trusteeship system in Palestine. French representative Barote asked the Security Council to proceed cautiously, hold a secret meeting first, listen to more detailed opinions from the U.S. representative, and then decide whether to convene a special General Assembly of the United Nations to review the original partition resolution of the General Assembly.

### Trade and Employment Conference Declared Closed

Truman Praises Trade Charter

[Central News Agency, Havana, 24th Dispatch] The United Nations Trade and Employment Conference officially closed today after signing the Charter of the World Trade Organization. The final resolution was written in the stipulated five languages. Kim Kian-soo, the Chinese ambassador to Belgium, signed the charter on behalf of China in the Chinese and English versions. The Council of the Interim Committee of the International Trade Organization will hold its first meeting in Geneva within the year. China is a member of the Council.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 24th Dispatch] President Truman referred to the results of the Havana International Trade Conference today, saying that the signing of the regulations of the International Commercial Organization is an important achievement in approaching construction, world prosperity, and lasting peace. He also said that this plan is sufficient to prove that many countries can rely on the United Nations to reach an agreement on international complex training issues.

### Berlin Four-Power Joint Command Conference Still Held as Usual, General Montgomery to Inspect British Zone in Germany

[Reuters, Berlin, 24th Dispatch] The deputy commanders of the British, American, French, and Soviet forces in Berlin today reached the "best understanding" on several issues in the Joint Command (i.e., the Allied Military Government of the Berlin area) in Berlin. A French military spokesperson later said that the four powers had reached an agreement on several issues. This is the first symbol of agreement between the powers since Marshal Sokolovsky walked out of the Allied Control Council meeting. It is reported that when the Joint Command meeting adjourned for lunch, the four commanders of the British, American, French, and Soviet forces toasted each other with vodka supplied by the Soviet side. According to a British military spokesperson, the meeting progressed very normally, and the atmosphere was even slightly friendlier than usual. At the same time, according to newspapers registered with the Soviet authorities, it is expected that the control of the border between West Germany and East Germany will be tightened.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 25th Dispatch] The Dutch military delegation to the Allied Control Commission for Germany, in the name of the heads of the delegations of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, issued a notice on the 25th stating that the delegations of the three countries did not participate in the discussion of German policy by the commanders of the British, American, and French forces stationed in Germany. The purpose of the Dutch, Belgian, and Luxembourg delegations attending the British, French, and American Commanders' Conference at the Lancashire House in Berlin was only to obtain information related to the interests of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 24th Dispatch] The British military government announced today that British Army Chief of Staff General Montgomery will inspect the British occupation zone in Germany on April 3, and is scheduled to go to Berlin on April 6.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th Dispatch] British Foreign Secretary Bevin said to the House of Commons this afternoon that he could not definitively say to what extent the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany had been disarmed. He said that he had very little information on the matter, and he wanted to tell everyone that he was very dissatisfied with this situation.

### Prospects for the Italian General Election

[Reuters, Rome, 25th Dispatch] Political observers here believe that if voters are very enthusiastic in the general election on April 18, then Gasperi and other moderate parties can be expected to win. However, it is difficult to predict the attitude of the ten million people in the middle class out of Italy's 46 million population. In general, Gasperi's heavy tax policy and tight monetary policy have hit the middle class quite hard. In addition, the general middle class mostly opposes church politics and is deeply dissatisfied with Gasperi's Christian Democratic Party's monopoly of power. However, on the other hand, the middle class is wary of the Communist Party in light of the Czech incident, and generally has a good impression of U.S. aid to Italy. Under these circumstances, the support of the middle class for moderate parties can be expected to be greater. On the left, at a recent meeting of Communist Party leaders and their allied parties, it was estimated that the People's Front led by the Communist Party could win about 11 million votes. There are about 27 million registered voters in Italy. If the Communist Party's estimate is fairly accurate, then the center and right-wing parties must redouble their efforts to gain a majority advantage over the Communist Party.

[United Press, Rome, 25th Dispatch] Italian military police launched searches for privately hidden weapons across the country today to prevent bloodshed in the April 18 election.

### Belgian Regent to Visit U.S. in Early April, White House to Treat as Distinguished Guest

[Agence France-Presse, Brussels, 24th Dispatch] The itinerary for Belgian Regent Prince Léopold's visit to the United States has been roughly finalized today. Prime Minister Spaak and some key members of economic groups will accompany him. Prince Léopold and his entourage are scheduled to depart from Brussels on April 3 and fly to Washington, D.C. On the 6th, President Truman will formally receive Prince Léopold at the White House, and a banquet will be held that evening to welcome him. On the 7th, Prince Léopold will leave the White House and go to Blair House. On the same day, he will also go to Arlington National Cemetery to visit the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and pay his respects to Washington's tomb on Mount Vernon. On the 8th, Prince Léopold will host a banquet for President Truman and his wife at the Belgian Embassy. On the 9th, he will visit the Tennessee Valley. On the 10th, Prince Léopold will leave Blair House, and from then on, the nature of the visit will be more private. From April 12 to 15, he will stay in New York and visit West Point Military Academy. He is scheduled to depart from the United States on April 15, and stay in Canada for two days. Canadian Prime Minister King plans to host a banquet in Ottawa. Prince Léopold is scheduled to depart from Ottawa on April 17 and fly back to Brussels.

### U.S. Undersecretary Meets with Ashida, Aiming to Promote Japan's Industrial Reconstruction, Ashida Requests More U.S. Assistance

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th Dispatch] U.S. Undersecretary of the Army Draper warned the Japanese government on the 25th that Japan must increase the production of important goods, revitalize foreign trade, and balance its budget in order to qualify for further U.S. assistance. A statement released by Allied Headquarters regarding the meeting between Draper and Ashida stated that Ashida raised the need for the United States to continue to assist Japan in the meeting in order to supplement Japan's self-reliance and become a self-sufficient country.

Draper then pointed out that some future aid plans, lease or loan methods may be considered by the U.S. Congress. Draper emphasized that U.S. assistance cannot continue indefinitely. "Assistance can only temporarily make up for shortages until Japan is able to help itself. Japan must do its best to achieve this." At the same time, John Johnston, the head of the National Chemical Bank, and Fish, the Special Advisor to the Undersecretary, also attended the meeting. This meeting particularly reviewed the situation regarding food, coal, and steel production, as this situation is the main foundation for self-sufficiency and economic turnaround. They also discussed the need to revitalize Japan's foreign trade, which is a way for Japan to obtain raw materials and supply urgently needed goods to countries in the Far East. Draper also emphasized the military importance of Japan balancing its budget, saying that this is an important condition for maintaining price and currency stability. Ashida promised to make the greatest effort to balance the budget "as soon as possible."

[United Press, Tokyo, 25th Dispatch] According to sources close to the Draper mission, the main purpose of the mission to Japan is to revitalize Japanese industry so that Japan can resume normal peacetime commercial relations with other countries without waiting for the conclusion of the Japanese peace treaty. This goal will be advanced within the scope of the occupation system.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 25th Dispatch] According to sources close to the U.S. Undersecretary of the Army Draper's inspection team, the opinions of the State Department and the Department of the Army differ greatly on the issue of Japan's industrial level. Draper's report after this inspection trip back to the United States may be used as the final decision plan, and it is believed that it will be largely similar to the Strike Plan. In addition, there is considerable emphasis here on the visit of U.S. Undersecretary of the Army Draper and his party to Japan to inspect industry, and they particularly expressed their "Japanese psychology." Various newspapers and people are emphasizing the meaning of "anti-communism." Recently, there have been rumors that Draper's trip has a mission to urge MacArthur to return home to run for election. If MacArthur is elected, the United States may have an anti-communist government.

U.S. Investigation Team Busy in Meetings in Japan

### Approval of the League Covenant by the Senate, Netherlands Recruits Army Reservists, Denmark Intensifies Coastal Defenses

[Reuters, Brussels, 24th] The Belgian Senate has recently approved the Five-Power Treaty by a vote of 128 to 15. The 15 dissenting votes were cast by Communist senators.

While these reports have been found to be untrue, the occurrence of such events is not impossible.

### Record of the Corfu Channel Case Hearing

— (By Our Special Correspondent in Europe, Zhongxi)

The Opening Remarks of the First Chamber

As the noise of the cameras subsided, President Guillet rose and addressed the court, stating that the International Court of Justice currently has two cases awaiting trial. One is the Corfu Channel case, which is beginning today, and the other is the case concerning the qualifications and conditions for a state to join the United Nations as a member. The latter case will open on April 15th of this year to hear opinions from all parties, and then the court will decide on providing advisory opinions to the United Nations.

Subsequently, Chilean Judge Álvarez and Albanian Ad Hoc Judge Xena were requested to stand up and take the oath of office. Raising their right hands, their oath was, "I solemnly declare that I will faithfully and honestly, impartially and conscientiously, perform the duties of a judge." After the oath, British lawyer Shawcross, the plaintiff, delivered his address. Shawcross is the current Attorney General of the United Kingdom, whose position is equivalent to our Minister of Justice. Known for his eloquence, he is physically robust and full of energy. Shawcross began by expressing his congratulations on the court's first session. He then stated, "The United Kingdom accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the then Permanent Court of International Justice eighteen years ago. The United Kingdom is extremely opposed to war, believing it to be the product of blind impulsive forces and an uncontrollable instinct, rather than something that can be overcome by human will and reason. The British people firmly believe that the will of mankind must overcome the forces of disturbance and destruction. Therefore, resolving disputes through law and justice is the most essential and indispensable condition for the international community. Consequently, the International Court of Justice bears an increasingly important responsibility for maintaining peace this year."

Then, Albanian representative Ili delivered his address, in addition to congratulating the court, emphasized that "equality, justice, and sovereignty" are the three major principles that the new court should respect in performing its duties. International disputes require careful investigation and study, and can only be resolved fairly through justice. While the International Court of Justice is promoting international justice, it cannot ignore reality and the application of international law. Mutual respect among nations is essential, as peace cannot rely solely on the laws of powerful nations. Therefore, the United Nations Charter clearly stipulates that all peace-loving nations enjoy equal sovereignty, and it is hoped that the court will not overlook this point.

On behalf of Albania, after its representative Ili addressed the court, Czech lawyer Professor Tranek, whom they had hired, presented the defense. Tranek cited classical works and referred to the authoritative theories of international law scholars, as well as the provisions of the United Nations Charter and the Statute of the Court, making a scholarly legal argument in French, which was then translated into English by an interpreter. His speech was quite lengthy, lasting from 5:00 p.m. on February 20th to 11:00 a.m. on February 28th, totaling nine hours over four sessions. Starting from 11:00 a.m. on February 28th, British lawyer Shawcross and British Foreign Office Legal Advisor Beckett successively rose to defend their case, repeatedly emphasizing the spirit of the Charter by citing past precedents. Due to the length of the speeches and the need for translation into French, it also took seven or eight sessions to conclude. On the afternoon of March 5th, the President announced a temporary adjournment to await a ruling.

Summary of Arguments by Plaintiff and Defendant

The Albanian government believes that according to the suggestion of the United Nations Security Council, the disputed case should be jointly submitted by the parties concerned to the International Court of Justice for trial. However, the United Kingdom filed a lawsuit unilaterally with the International Court of Justice without obtaining the consent of the Albanian government in advance, which violates Article 36 of the United Nations Charter and Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. At the same time, the Security Council's action was a "suggestion" and not a "resolution," so the Albanian government is not bound by it. In short, the British government filed the lawsuit without consulting or agreeing with the Albanian government after the Security Council's suggestion, which is not in accordance with the regulations. The International Court of Justice should not accept this case, and it also has no right to exercise compulsory jurisdiction over the Albanian government.

The British government believes that the Albanian government is unwilling to submit to the International Court of Justice for trial merely because of procedural issues that would harm Albania's face. The British government can immediately suggest here and now that an agreement be made with the Albanian government to jointly submit the Corfu Channel case to the International Court of Justice for a ruling. Moreover, before the Albanian government refused to submit to the trial, the British government never mentioned the issue of compulsory jurisdiction. However, since Albania did not accept this suggestion, the British government's attitude towards this case is that the Security Council's suggestion has binding force not only morally but also legally. Albania once requested to join the United Nations, and its willingness to fulfill the obligations of a member state goes without saying. Therefore, it should abide by Article 25 of the United Nations Charter and fulfill the suggestion of the Security Council. Furthermore, according to the provisions of the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice on March 11, 1936, non-member states can also submit disputes to the court for adjudication without having an agreement with the disputing state. If the British interpretation is incorrect, the court can be asked to clarify it immediately. In short, we cannot evade the jurisdiction of the court due to technical issues. According to Article 92 of the United Nations Charter, the International Court of Justice is the main judicial organ of the United Nations, and the British government applied based on the Security Council's suggestion. The International Court of Justice has the right to exercise jurisdiction.

Whether the mines that damaged British ships in the Corfu Channel were laid by the Albanian government is still uncertain. However, it is said that the reason Albania expressed acceptance of the Security Council's suggestion was that the Albanian government believed that it could be approved as a member of the United Nations at the Second General Assembly of the United Nations. Unexpectedly, things did not go as desired afterward, so it argued that there were procedural errors on the part of the United Kingdom and appealed that the court should not accept the case, thereby dismissing it.

General predictions are that if the Albanian government's reasons are agreed upon by a majority of judges in this hearing, the International Court of Justice will no longer hear the British government's lawsuit against Albania. Conversely, if a majority of judges believe that there were no improper procedures on the part of the United Kingdom, then the International Court of Justice will order both parties to submit the main issue of the Corfu Channel case to the court for trial. Even if Albania refuses to participate, the court will conduct a trial in absentia and make a ruling. (End)

### Associations of People from Disaster-Stricken Provinces Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday: Compatriots Should Be Especially Cautious Not to Be Exploited by the Communist Bandits; Request the Government to Form Armed Return-to-Hometown Teams to Fight Back to Our Old Homes

The joint meeting of the Shanghai-based hometown associations of various provinces suffering from bandit disasters was held at the Lakes Society on Guizhou Road at 3:00 p.m. on the 25th. Attendees included Presidium members Ma Shuli, Gu Zhuxuan (Northern Jiangsu Hometown Association), Sun Yixiang, Chen Yide, Cao Zhigong (Anhui Hometown Association), Li Shenxun (Shandong Hometown Association), He Bolin (Shaanxi Hometown Association), Jia Yuesheng (Henan Hometown Association); guests including Mayor Wu Guozhen (represented by Zhu Fengwei), Chairman Fang Zhi, Central Committee member Ye Suzhong, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee Tan Yimin, and more than 500 representatives of refugees from various provinces. Chairman Ma Shuli reported on the significance of the meeting after formal greetings, stating that the Communist bandits have undermined unification, disrupted peace, shaken the foundation of the nation, and harmed the people's livelihood, so that even two years after the completion of victory, countless compatriots are still living a life of displacement, deprivation, and lack of food and clothing. He continued that the refugees exiled in Shanghai are willing to fight back to their old homes and engage in a life-and-death struggle with the Communist bandits. He concluded by saying that there are many Communist underground workers lurking in the city, and refugees should be especially cautious not to be exploited by them. After his speech, he invited Mayor Wu's representative Zhu Fengwei and Chairman Fang Zhi to deliver their addresses. Zhu pointed out that suppressing bandits and quelling the rebellion is the only way to stabilize China and enable the people to live and work in peace. During this period of bandit suppression, the people should cooperate with the government and the military, mobilize the strength of the people, cooperate with military actions, eliminate the Communist bandits, and build the country.

### Chairman Fang Instructs: "Three Suppressions" and "Three Nos" to Deal with the Communist Bandits

Chairman Fang said that refugees from various provinces exiled in Shanghai should be particularly vigilant and not be exploited by Communist underground workers. The Communist bandits plan to launch the "Five Strikes and One Disaster" in Shanghai, with the so-called "One Disaster" being the exploitation of refugees to cause trouble and destruction. Therefore, refugees should strengthen unity, inspect their internal affairs, and prevent the Communists from infiltrating their activities. The Communist bandits attempt to disrupt public order with the "Five Strikes and One Disaster," so we should deal with them with "Three Suppressions" and "Three Nos." The "Three Suppressions" are: suppress local Communists, suppress foreign Communists, and suppress fake Communists. The "Three Nos" are: do not work for the Communist bandits, do not be tools for the Communist bandits, and do not be guides for the Communist bandits. Only in this way can the Communist bandits be eliminated. On the one hand, we hope that the government will step up relief efforts for the refugees, and on the other hand, we hope that the refugees will be law-abiding, obey government decrees, and not be exploited by the Communist bandits. After his speech, Central Committee member Ye Suzhong was invited to speak. Subsequently, refugee representatives from various provinces, including Northern Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong, such as Ling Xiaotian, Sun Tiewu, Wang Huamin, and Yang Tonglin, reported on the atrocities in the various bandit-controlled areas, with many somber and tearful accounts. In particular, Ling Xiaotian personally recounted how his brothers were killed by the bandits, and when the bandits broke into Yancheng, his parents, wife, and children were scattered by the bandits, and their whereabouts are still unknown. He escaped alone, and his words were filled with tears. The other representatives also spoke with great passion, vowing to fight the Communist bandits to the end and firmly requesting the government to organize armed return-to-hometown teams to fight back to their old homes. Finally, Gu Zhuxuan added a conclusion, and the atmosphere was unprecedentedly enthusiastic, and the meeting dispersed at 6:00 p.m.

### Publishing a Letter to All Circles, Exposing the Communist Bandits' Conspiracy

The Shanghai-based hometown associations of various provinces suffering from bandit disasters issued a "Respectful Letter to People of All Circles," stating, "Dear compatriots: Ever since the Communist bandits betrayed the country, undermined unification, raised troops to create chaos, and launched liquidation struggles everywhere, slaughtering the innocent, our kind refugees from various provinces have been coming to Shanghai one after another, either out of righteousness and seeking brightness, or forced to leave their homes and flee for their lives, numbering no less than hundreds of thousands. We have witnessed our relatives and friends being subjected to all kinds of cruel torture and slaughter by the bandits, our fathers, brothers, and sons being forced to join the army and driven to the front lines as cannon fodder, and we are even more heartbroken that our hometowns have fallen and been disrupted and harassed by the bandits, forcing us to wander here, even without food or clothing, nowhere to live and no means to survive. Although we have been given shelter from the cold and food relief by the enlightened authorities of this city and enthusiastic people from all walks of life, allowing most refugees to barely survive the winter, we deeply understand today's tragic situation and the origins of our suffering. With tears streaming down our faces, we respectfully reveal several points to people of all circles: (1) What the Communist bandits have done in the bandit-controlled areas can be said to be completely against humanity, against reason, destroying moral principles and ethics. They use all means to implement autocratic rule by thugs and create struggles. The lives of the people can be taken at any time under various pretexts such as 'national traitor,' 'reactionary,' 'ideologically unstable,' and 'capitalist.' The people's freedom of speech and publication is even out of the question. Therefore, when we see those who have been deceived by the Communist bandits' propaganda still talking and singing about the democracy and freedom in the bandit-controlled areas, we really don't know whether to laugh or cry. Here, we want to loudly appeal to people of all circles that the Communist bandits' propaganda is all a means and a disguise. Before the Communist bandits invaded, we also had this kind of fantasy, but the facts tell us the opposite. Therefore, our compatriots in the rear, in order to protect your lives and property and avoid our current situation, must contribute money and effort to mobilize and eliminate the Communist bandits. (2) Who doesn't have parents, who doesn't have siblings? Today, we abandoned our relatives and friends, left our homes, and wandered here, not for personal safety or to prolong our lives. What we only hope for is, on the one hand, to tell our compatriots about the suffering we have experienced so that they will not be deceived again. On the other hand, we mainly appeal to the government to promptly send more troops to strengthen the suppression of the rebellion, recover the hometowns that are being ravaged by the bandits, save the millions of refugees who are suffering in the depths of misery, see the light of day again as soon as possible, and enable us, the homeless wanderers, to return to our hometowns. We will surely act as pioneers for the government and cooperate with the national army to fully suppress the bandits. We hope that the people from all walks of life in the rear will give us their strongest support. (3) In this difficult situation, in order to create rumors, stir up trouble, sow discord, disrupt social order, and undermine local security, the Communist bandits do not hesitate to use all kinds of despicable means to exploit our refugees. Regarding this issue, in addition to expressing our gratitude for the concern of all parties, we especially want to point out and ask everyone to rest assured that the plight of our refugees today is entirely caused by the Communist bandits. The Communist bandits' various conspiracies and means may deceive others, but we have already suffered from them. Any small favors or lures cannot entice or deceive us. In addition to stepping up automatic prevention and reporting and strictly abiding by government laws and not acting outside the law, we will never allow the Communist bandits' conspiracy to succeed in the slightest. Dear compatriots, the Communist bandits' ambition is definitely not limited to one area or one place. Their goal is simply to ravage and invade our entire country in order to achieve their vicious conspiracy of betraying the motherland and destroying the motherland. Therefore, whether we are in the front or the rear, whether we have been invaded by the Communist bandits or not, our destinies are indeed the same. In addition to thanking people from all walks of life for their warm assistance and warm emotions, we must strengthen unity even more in the future and strengthen the revolutionary task of suppressing the rebellion and building the country under the leadership of an enlightened leader. Finally, we want to shout: 1. Support the government's strengthening of the suppression of the rebellion. 2. Refugees, organize yourselves and fight back to your old homes. 3. Do not be incited by the Communist bandits or enticed by the Communist bandits. 4. Absolutely abide by government laws and do not act outside the law. 5. Everyone, rise up and eliminate the Communist bandits. 6. Long live the Three Principles of the People. 7. Long live President Chiang. 8. Long live the Republic of China." The telegram from Chairman Chiang to the Assembly: The telegram from Chairman Chiang is as follows: "To Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government, Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Bai of the Ministry of National Defense, Chief of Staff Chen, Directors of the various Headquarters, Commanders-in-Chief of the various Bandit Suppression Headquarters, and Directors of the various Pacification Commissioner's Offices, all officers and soldiers of the national bandit suppression, and all people of the country: Since the disarmament of Yu and the removal of armor from the island barbarians, China has been rebuilt and everyone rejoices. However, the wicked Communist bandits have, at the time of recovery and advancement and after the people suffered from war, stirred up a great wave of internal strife, hindering national construction. The people have been plunged into misery, and the foundation of the nation has been shaken. Their madness is unparalleled. Two years after the victory, the bandit atmosphere is becoming more intense. Looking ahead, we are filled with anger. This assembly in Shanghai unanimously supports the national policy of suppressing the rebellion. The military and the people cooperate to quell the bandit scourge, strengthen self-defense forces, protect the country and defend the hometown, and await deployment. We beseech you to comply with public opinion, launch a major attack, quickly quell the rebellion, recover the bandit areas, remove the obstacles to unification and rejuvenation, and achieve the great cause of suppressing the rebellion and saving the country. The nation and the people will deeply benefit from this. We urgently submit our words, and we hope that you will give them consideration. Respectfully, the joint meeting of the Shanghai-based hometown associations of various provinces suffering from bandit disasters."

### General Labor Union's Letter to Fellow Workers: Strengthen Vigilance, Self-Discipline, and Self-Encouragement

In response to the municipal security authorities' arrest of communist elements, the General Labor Union issued a letter to fellow workers yesterday. The full text reads: "Dear Fellow Workers: This union has received reports from various industry unions that military and police authorities have arrested several workers in recent days, requesting the union's assistance. The union immediately inquired with the responsible authorities about the reasons for the arrests. The municipal security authorities explained that based on leads from confessions of communist elements, they arrested communist elements hiding in the city and were gathering concrete evidence. There was absolutely no indiscriminate arrest. This afternoon, they invited this union and other groups and organizations to the municipal government to publicly view the evidence seized this time. After reviewing the evidence, this union believes that the government's emergency measures are based on factual evidence. Therefore, our General Labor Union hereby formally announces our attitude and position to all our fellow workers:

First, since the Lunar New Year, communist conspiracies have emerged one after another. The seized evidence proves that the communists have been plotting large-scale destruction of public utilities and production enterprises and inciting strikes. Recently, as the National Assembly is about to convene, the communists are preparing to cause disturbances and create a climate of terror in various parts of the Jiangnan region to obstruct the implementation of national constitutional governance. The government's measures to protect social security and promote the suppression of the rebellion are something this union supports wholeheartedly, along with all compatriots nationwide.

Second, the government had solid evidence and meticulous planning before this action to arrest traitorous bandits. Afterwards, they openly invited people from all walks of life to report on the process and view the evidence, demonstrating the government's determination to protect human rights and the absence of indiscriminate arrests. Therefore, we will no longer listen to any distortions, provocations, or incitements.

Third, the state does not protect nationals who betray the country, and society does not tolerate those who betray it. Our General Labor Union is a workers' organization, and our responsibility is to protect good workers and maintain production enterprises. Communist elements sell out the interests of the country and the nation, which is intolerable to the country and society. We certainly cannot allow them to exploit our good workers. Therefore, all our workers should strengthen vigilance, self-discipline, and self-encouragement, and expel all communist elements who betray the country and the nation from the working class.

Finally, we put forward our slogans: (1) Support the government in suppressing the rebellion and building the country. (2) Ensure that good workers can work in peace. (3) The union protects good workers, not communists. (4) Kick out the communist elements. (5) Expel the communist elements who sabotage production."

### Plain Carriages and White Horses in Front of Jade Buddha Temple: All Circles Mourn Xu Jingren, More Than 300 Friends Attending, Utmost Honor and Grief

[Reported by this newspaper] Xu Jingren, a well-known figure in the industrial and commercial world, passed away in Shanghai last month. All parties expressed their deep sorrow. Fourteen units in the city, including the Zhongnan Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Jin Cheng Bank, the Four Banks Savings Society, the Dasheng Textile Company, the Defu Jin Salt Company, the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, the Datong Tobacco Company, the Fulimin Iron Mine Company, the Anhui Shanghai Fellow Association, Nantong College, Jingren Private Middle School, and this newspaper, held a memorial service at the Jade Buddha Temple yesterday afternoon, coinciding with Xu's family memorial. Over 300 people attended, including Chen Guangfu, Fang Zhi, Qian Yongming, Yang Hu, Shi Yonggeng, Duanmu Kai, Yan Zhuang, and Xu Jijing. Wei Xiaofu, Yan Zhuang, and Lu Tingkui first reported on Xu's life and deeds, followed by a public memorial service. The layout of the mourning hall was extremely solemn. Among the elegiac couplets sent by various circles, Yu Youren wrote, "Used commerce to uphold morality with heroic spirit; In old age, lived like a hermit in the market, braving unexpected waves." Shi Yonggeng wrote, "Remembering the time when my late father started his business, he tasted all the hardships of farming, fortunately inheriting the spirit of reform, helping those in need with his own hands; Hearing the news of Mr. Ren's passing, I am at a loss, unable to bear listening to the dirge, every household mourns with grief." Zhao Banfu wrote, "I shared a bond of brotherhood with your late father, for thirty-nine years, I treated the orphans of my deceased friend as if they were my own; This humble person is heartbroken and tearful, with a hundred million thoughts, tracing his lifelong virtues, how can I repay them." Those attending yesterday were all friends of Mr. Xu during his lifetime and the younger generation in the industrial and commercial sectors who benefited from his kindness. Plain carriages and white horses demonstrated the utmost honor and grief. Xu, originally from Dangtu, Anhui Province, was registered in Zhenjiang. He was honest, sincere, and forthright, and dedicated his life to industry. He was a close friend of Zhang Jian of Nantong and was a pioneer of national industry. He also devoted himself to finance, participating in the planning of Zhongnan Bank and the Four Banks Savings Society. During his lifetime, he enjoyed nurturing talents and supporting young people without reservation, donating land to fund Jingren in Anhui and the Shanghai China Vocational School, and serving as the president of Nantong College. When the late General Manager of this newspaper took over, he encountered great difficulties, and it was thanks to Xu's righteous assistance that it was able to continue. His contribution to culture and his generous and heroic spirit are unforgettable. In recent years, Xu retired due to old age and unfortunately passed away on February 20, at the age of seventy-eight.

### Draftees Who Drew Lots Flee, Decision to Temporarily Suspend Number Matching, Authorities to Discuss Prevention Measures

[Reported by this newspaper] After the Civil Affairs Bureau drew lots for draftees in the city the day before yesterday and announced the names of draftees born in 1927 in the Huangpu District, a serious phenomenon of draftees fleeing occurred in various districts yesterday. After receiving a report from Cheng Jingyuan, the head of Huangpu District, yesterday morning, the Civil Affairs Bureau decided to temporarily suspend the lot-drawing work. Mayor Wu will convene the Military Service Association and responsible officials from relevant military service organs in the coming days to discuss measures to prevent draftees from fleeing. Pan Gongzhan, chairman of the Military Service Association, will issue a letter to the citizens regarding (1) the implementation of a voluntary soldier system and a lottery system in Shanghai this year, complementing each other, (2) the 6,000 conscripted soldiers will be trained locally, protecting the local area and not being transferred out of Shanghai, and (3) generous settlement allowances, to dissuade draftees from fleeing. According to inquiries with the Huangpu District Office, it was confirmed that draftees in various districts of the district had indeed fled yesterday. However, the exact number of those who fled had not yet been received as of late evening. The district has ordered the heads of various districts to explain the situation to the draftees and their families, persuading them not to flee. The person in charge of the district stated that the draftees' actions cannot be monitored before receiving the conscription notice and conscription ticket.

### Supplementary Applications for Exemption or Postponement of Conscription to End This Month

It is also learned that draftees who have reasons for exemption or postponement of conscription that occurred after the application period last year can still apply to the Civil Affairs Bureau. However, in order to unify the review, the authorities have decided that the deadline for accepting supplementary applications or submitting supplementary documents is the end of this month.

### Wounded Soldiers Destroy Police Booth, Misunderstanding Leads to Dispute, Resolved Through Explanation

[Reported by this newspaper] Recently, wounded soldiers have been transiting through the city on their way to hospitals in various places. Yesterday, another thousand wounded soldiers arrived by train from Suzhou and were to transfer to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangtai ship to go to the rear hospitals in Hankou. The ship was originally scheduled to depart at 8:00 PM the day before yesterday, but was delayed until last night due to excessive loading of military rice. As a result, some of the wounded soldiers went ashore to shop or take a walk. Unexpectedly, at around 8:30 AM, two wounded soldiers walked to the front of the Bank of Communications on Zhongshan East 2nd Road and bought one catty of oranges from Chen Jinbiao (35 years old) and Fang Senmei (21 years old), who were selling oranges from a water cart. Chen and Fang asked for 35,000 yuan per catty, while the wounded soldiers offered 20,000 yuan, leading to a dispute. The two sides then started fighting, wrestling together. A policeman from the Yimiao Police Station, number 6363, arrived to mediate but was unsuccessful, so he took the two vendors to the police station. The wounded soldiers also went to the station to testify. Unexpectedly, other wounded soldiers who witnessed the situation mistakenly thought that their companions had been taken away by the police. They rushed back to the ship, gathered over a hundred wounded soldiers, and swarmed to the Yimiao Police Station on Fangbang Road, demanding that the police hand over the two vendors so that they could take them away and punish them. They also accused the police station of taking away the wounded soldiers. In the chaos, a police booth in front of the police station was damaged, and a large glass pane in the display window was smashed with wooden sticks. The police station immediately telegraphed the headquarters for instructions. Before long, a red police car arrived, and the Shanghai Garrison also dispatched a large number of military police to the scene to suppress the situation. Zhou, the chief of the Qifen Police Station, and Section Chief Qi invited the military officers in charge of the wounded soldiers to explain the misunderstanding for about half an hour, and the dispute was finally resolved.

### City Council and Other Groups Send Telegram to U.S. President Urging: Communist Threat to China and Europe is the Same, Urgent Hope for Full Military and Economic Aid

After the closing of the Shanghai City Council's Fifth General Assembly, Speaker Pan Gongzhan, noting the rampant communists, rising prices, prevalent rumors, and social instability, believes that the current situation requires urgently uniting the middle-class intellectuals and all those who rely on wages for a living, changing their attitude of standing idly by, and actively working to urge the government to make radical reforms in politics, military affairs, finance, and economy, while intensifying the suppression of the rebellion at the front and stabilizing the rear. Only then can it cooperate with foreign aid, overcome the crisis, and prevent China from becoming a vassal of a communist totalitarian state. In recent days, he has invited the presidents of universities and leaders of social organizations in the city to carefully study the situation, hoping to contribute to national affairs. It is heard that they have recently formulated concrete opinions on political, military, financial, and economic reforms, and will issue a letter to the public to seek resonance from those who care about national affairs. The text of the telegram sent by the university presidents and leaders of social organizations to U.S. President Truman on the 25th is previewed below:

To His Excellency President Truman: We, the organizations and universities represented by the undersigned, wholeheartedly welcome Your Excellency's speech to a joint session of Congress in which you urged the United States to take the lead in the global fight against communism. While we cannot help but feel slightly disappointed that your speech did not specifically mention the struggle in China, we are convinced that the communist threat you described, and the need for swift action, is the same in China as it is in Europe. Your Excellency is well aware of the strategy of the Communist Party and the situation in China. Although the actual application of the Chinese Communist strategy is slightly different from that elsewhere, its basic form, and the ultimate goal of communism, are the same in both Europe and China. The conquest of China, like the conquest of Europe, is a strategic objective of communism. The Chinese people learned a lesson in the last war, knowing full well that no act of aggression can be spiritually or geographically contained. In our war against Japan, we already knew that after Japan ignited the flames of aggression in the Northeast, they would eventually spread throughout the world. We believe that from a historical point of view, the current situation is very similar to that time. If communism is allowed to gain a foothold in the Far East, the threat will inevitably extend to the peace and security of the United States and the entire world. We venture to appeal to Your Excellency to bring the Chinese situation

The urgent situation, to the attention of your people, and give China full and effective military and economic assistance, so that China can continue its resistance to communist aggression. Our troops urgently need a steady stream of large quantities of armaments, food, and other necessary military supplies. Our serious economic situation also urgently requires foreign aid. We believe that if the United States can provide this kind of supply and assistance today, the final balance sheet of human affairs will show that the cost of another world war is much lower. If the United States can immediately assist China without hesitation, it will be able to maintain world peace at the cost of armaments and money, rather than paying with lives and flesh. Any further delay will have unfortunate consequences. We, in our capacity as leaders of Chinese civil society groups and universities, assure Your Excellency that when American aid arrives, we will also do our utmost to enhance the spiritual, political and material organization of the National Government. We urgently hope that, with the help of the United States, Chinese intellectuals will be able to achieve their dual goals of reforming the government and containing communism.

### Engineering Survey of the Duyi Section of the Hunan-Guizhou Railway, the Southwest's Major Artery (Part 1)

[Our Newspaper, Guiyang, 20th by airmail] The Hunan-Guizhou Railway is a major artery in southwestern China and is of vital importance. In the spring of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945], in preparation for the counter-offensive against Japan and to complete the five-year railway plan, the original Hunan-Guizhou and Guizhou-Guangxi Railway Engineering Bureaus were merged to form the Hunan-Guizhou Railway Engineering Office. The office was responsible for restoring the tracks and continuing unfinished projects. The construction of the Duyun-Guiyang section was handled by the Duyi Section Engineering Office, which was organized by the bureau in the summer of the 35th year [1946]. The Ministry of Communications specially appointed Mr. Liu Jianxi, who is known in the railway engineering field for his expertise and experience, to oversee the matter. Since the establishment of the office, it has been actively carrying out construction work. Now, more than a year and a half has passed, and despite difficulties such as tight national treasury funds, transportation difficulties, material shortages, and skyrocketing prices, thanks to the concerted efforts of all the staff and workers, 25% of the entire section has been completed, which is truly commendable.

The Duyi section of the railway starts from Qingtaipo in Duyun County, passes through Mapo, Yongxingzhuang, Wendezhuang, Bianzidian in Duyun County, Rongbusi, Gumeng, Gudong, Leping, Wudongqiao in Majiang County, Shaping in Pingyue County, Guguan, Guanyinge, Toudaoqiao, Tailaochong, Taohuazhai, Tongbao, Mulaozhai, Zhangjiashan in Guiding County, Sanyuanchang, Longtouying, Zhimapu, Wuxingqiao, Longshi County Town, Shuiqiao, Zhongba, Meijiazhuang in Longxing County, Wangbashan, Gelaochang, Ergezai in Guizhu County, and ends in the southern suburbs of Guiyang City, with a total length of 150 kilometers. Along the line, it crosses the Wuxue Mountains of the Miao mountains and the upper reaches of the Yuan River flowing into Sichuan and the upper reaches of the Dao River flowing into Sichuan. Due to the limitations of terrain and environment, not only are the mountains high and the valleys deep, and the population density relatively sparse, making construction inconvenient, but also the most difficult part of the entire section is located in the counties of Guiding, Pingyue, Majiang, and Duyun, where American tobacco production is particularly developed and the rural economy is prosperous. The engineering staff and workers suffer greatly from the skyrocketing prices and difficult living conditions.

The reporter recently visited all the construction sites along the entire section, guided by the head of the Engineering Section of the Engineering Office, Wang Daoyuan, and the chief engineers and heads of various sections, who provided detailed explanations, which were very informative. The tour lasted four days, covering a total of 2,350 meters of large and small tunnels, 680 meters of large bridges, 800 meters of small bridges, 40 kilometers of material transportation roads, 1.5 million cubic meters of earth and stone work, two dining and station ticket offices, and 170 kilometers of telecommunications equipment, with a round trip of 338 kilometers. Everywhere we went, the engineering staff and workers spoke to the reporters with the most enthusiastic sincerity and the most earnest attitude about the most difficult work and the most ideal hopes. The so-called most ideal hope is that the government will allocate sufficient funds for large-scale construction as soon as possible, and promptly raise and transport the materials for large-scale construction, so that they can be responsible for quickly completing the remaining 75% of this southwest artery within one and a half to at most two years, and open it to traffic as soon as possible. They can then go to other places where they are needed to work for the construction of railways for the motherland. The reporter will now describe the findings of the tour one by one to share with readers who are concerned about transportation in the southwest.

Our group of six left Guiyang by jeep at 9:00 a.m. on the 11th of this month, following the Duyi section of the highway. Liu Jianxi, the head of the Duyi Section Engineering Office, specially sent Wang Daoyuan, the head of the engineering section in charge of engineering, to accompany us to visit the construction along the line. The jeep sped south at a rapid pace. Wang took the opportunity to tell me about the construction of this section of the road on the car

Let us have a general understanding first. At around 10:00 a.m., we arrived at Bowushui River, three kilometers from Longli County, to visit the construction of the bridge there. The chief engineer of the bridge project and the heads of the sections had arrived earlier and were warmly welcomed with scaled-down drawings, schematic diagrams, project progress charts, and written explanations. The bridge is built over the Bowushui River, about 500 meters away from the highway bridge, with a total length of 82 meters, divided into five piers and three spans, each span being 21 meters in length. In terms of bridge construction, 50% has been completed. All bridge steel structures have been shipped to Guiyang. There are currently over a hundred workers working day and night in shifts without interruption. However, the concrete required for the bridge deck does not meet the standard of nearby sand and gravel, and it is necessary to transport it from mountainous areas 28 kilometers away, which is very difficult.

After visiting the Bowushui Bridge, we continued south. At around 12:00 p.m., we arrived 1.5 kilometers from Guiding and turned onto a material transport road built by the Duyi Section Engineering Office, about 3 kilometers to the location of the second section. The site was the former site of the Ministry of Communications' Qianzhong Machinery Factory. After renovation, it was quite clean and suitable, and there was also a Ministry-established Rotary Elementary School. Zhang Rong, the head of the second section, is from Xingyi in this province and graduated from Nanjing Central University. He has worked in the Yuehan, Hunan-Guangxi, and Guizhou-Guangxi railways for more than 20 years and has contributed greatly to the surveying work of the Duyi section. According to Zhang's report to the reporter on the construction of the section, the second section starts from Chahe, which belongs to Majiang County, to Zhangjiashan, which belongs to Guiding County, with a total length of about 30 kilometers. There are a total of 23 large and small tunnels, with a total length of 3,608 meters. The most difficult part of the tunnel engineering is the lack of American-made yellow explosives, the TNT toxin is too heavy, and it has been difficult to purchase them in recent years. Many tunnel projects, although the blast holes have been drilled, cannot be continued due to the lack of explosives. In addition, it is also necessary to build large bridges

More than ten, and more than twenty small bridges. Due to the complex geology, construction is the most difficult. Among them, the Dalishu Bridge on the border between Guiding and Majiang, is 290 meters long, divided into nine spans and twelve piers, the bridge is 30 meters high, and the span is 20 meters. It is a reinforced concrete arch bridge, which is rare south of the Yangtze River.

The earthwork of the entire section has long been completed by migrant workers from nearby counties. The remaining small stone work will be carried out before the track is laid, which will not hinder the track laying time.

As of now, the total engineering of the entire section has been completed by 20%. The biggest difficulties are three: First, the funding from the Ministry is not timely. Second, there is a lack of urgently needed materials. Third, the salaries of employees are too low. In recent years, Guiding and neighboring counties have produced a large amount of American tobacco, and the local economy is abnormally prosperous, resulting in soaring prices, which is particularly alarming, and the gap is very large compared to Guiyang, the provincial capital. However, the salaries received by the employees of this section are paid according to the general living index of the Guizhou area. Therefore, the turnover of lower-level employees and those who are not enthusiastic about the project is very large, and the future is worrying. The section has organized a consumer cooperative for daily necessities, and uses spare time to run a farm, grow vegetables, and borrow wasteland to produce American tobacco. Last year, the total revenue from American tobacco was more than 30 million yuan, and each of the more than 200 people in the entire section could receive 150,000 to 60,000 yuan, but it was a drop in the bucket and did not help much. In February of this year, the food expenses for each employee were more than 600,000 yuan, and it is estimated that it will be close to one million this month. This situation will inevitably affect the progress of the project, and it is hoped that there will be concrete solutions.

The reporter and his party took a short rest in the second section and then went to visit the Wenjiang Temple Tunnel. The tunnel is located under Yangbao Mountain, 10 kilometers from Guiding County. Construction began on June 12 of the 35th year [1946], making it the earliest tunnel project in the Duyi section.

The pilot tunnel is 415 meters long and was completely opened two months ago. It is now undergoing expansion and bottoming work. Due to the poor geology and the mixture of sand and gravel, there are often collapses. After the wooden arch and stone arch are completed in the future, there will be no worries.

After visiting Wenjiang Temple, we returned to the second section for lunch. At 2:00 p.m., we traveled south through Guiding County and arrived at the Gumengguan Tunnel in Pingyue County at around 4:00 p.m. The director of the tunnel project, engineer Lu Yongying, and others greeted us in front of the car with great enthusiasm. The location is located on the watershed of the Yunwu Mountains, 1,600 meters above sea level, and the geology is extremely complex, making construction the most difficult. It is not only the most difficult in the Duyi section, but also ranks fourth in terms of the size of the project in the national railway tunnel projects. After resting for a while at Shaping Station, which was built near the eastern end of the large tunnel, we gathered and entered the tunnel for a visit. The pilot tunnel is 960 meters long and is divided into east and west sections for construction. The east section is 480 meters long and is managed by engineer Shen Jun. Construction began on May 1 of the 36th year [1947]. The west section is 480 meters long and is managed by engineer Zhang Zong. Construction began on March 10 of the same year. Due to the poor soil quality in the east section, it collapsed repeatedly, consuming labor and time, which delayed the work of the pilot tunnel. The west section progressed more smoothly due to the better rock quality. The highest record for the progress of the two sections was 4 meters per day. (Meng Qi)

### Jiaxing to Hold Rice Rationing Starting in May: Two Dou Per Person Per Month

[Our Newspaper, Jiaxing, 24th] The County Food Regulation Committee decided at a meeting at 3:00 p.m. on the 23rd to hold rice rationing starting in May. The target is the extremely poor households in the county, and each person will be allowed to purchase two dou per month, calculated at 70% of the market price. The source of the allocated rice is more than 712 shi of grain from the surplus of the 300 million grain loan, and 4,000 shi will be drawn from the grain received in the warehouse under the 36th year field tax. In addition, 3,300 shi will be raised from large households in various towns and villages, and 1,700 shi will be raised from various commercial associations, totaling approximately 10,000 shi of grain. The above two methods of rationing and fundraising have been revised and approved.

### The People's Livelihood in the Shandong Pacification Area

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 22nd by airmail] Shandong is still in a stage of life-and-death struggle, and the situation is fluid and unstable, with everything shifting with military operations. Of the entire province, the government can effectively control only 17 counties, while 47 counties have fallen. There are 22 semi-controlled counties, 10 counties with controlled strongholds, and 11 counties that are frequently changing hands. These numbers can help us understand the hardship of today's situation in Shandong and the haggardness of the people's livelihood.

The lives of farmers throughout the province are on the edge of the subsistence line. The income from farmers' hard work is not enough to cover the expenses of taxes, and they are currently in a state of semi-starvation. According to a person in charge of the provincial government, as of February of this year, more than 40% of the people in the province were not getting enough to eat, and when the harvest approaches, at least 80% of the people will not have enough food to eat. In this situation of food shortage, the phenomenon of strong men fleeing famine has occurred. For example, in Yixian County alone, one-third of the population has fled famine. When they leave their hometowns, they carry a bag on their shoulders and are penniless, sealing the door with soil and leaving without any hesitation. Because they have sold everything in their homes, and they do not know when they will return to their hometowns, they have no nostalgia. However, within the control area of the Shandong Provincial Government, wasteland accounts for only 20% of the total area, and the food shortage is so serious. The reason is still due to the lack of seeds, agricultural tools, and labor, and the main reason is that the farmers' military burden is too heavy.

Among the military burdens, in addition to general taxes, the supply of troops passing through is most worthy of study. For example, Ziyang County (Duizhou) in Shandong was recovered by the National Army in May last year and is now the headquarters of the 10th Pacification District. There is a joint military-civilian station there that specializes in purchasing supplies for the needs of passing troops. From May last year to February this year, it supplied more than 9.4 million catties of firewood, more than 2.3 million catties of grass, more than 1.3 million catties of feed, and more than 210,000 catties of sorghum. The above is the supply of materials. As for the requisition of labor, the cooperative station has replaced bullock carts for the passing troops more than 9,500 times, hired civilians more than 34,000 times, and hired carpenters more than 950 times and masons more than 1,000 times. In addition, there are scattered soldiers and guerrillas who directly extort grain, firewood, civilians, and vehicles from the people, and the numbers are not included. Ziyang is a county with a population of only 200,000, and the wounds of war have not yet recovered. The current massive supply has emptied the rural areas, and both the local county government and the passing troops admit this fact. The situation is similar in other counties within the pacification area.

This is a very serious problem, and its direct impact is to cause food shortages and the flight of strong men. Moreover, according to General Li Yutang, commander of the 10th Pacification District, the bandits, in view of the widespread food shortage in Shandong, are putting forward the slogans of "no conscription" and "protecting refugees" in the controlled areas to attract fleeing populations, which has been quite effective. The local administrative cadres in Shandong have also recognized the location of the crisis from the difficulties they have encountered. Because if the status quo is allowed to continue, the bankruptcy of the countryside and the change in the psychology of the people will inevitably give the bandits an opportunity to absorb a large number of people who are trying to escape from production, and their strength will grow day by day, making it difficult for the suppression military to achieve complete success. Therefore, the National Army should immediately establish formal supply agencies in various villages

This military supply should be changed into a national burden, rather than a unique burden for the farmers in the pacification area, and on a fair standpoint, it should be borne by the wealthy households in the large cities in the rear. The Shandong authorities recognized the importance of local armed forces the earliest, and began to organize and train them a year and a half ago to assist the National Army in combat. There were originally many hidden guns among the people in various counties in Shandong, averaging at least 1,000 per county, and more in counties such as Tengxian, about 10,000 or more. In the recent battles of Zichuan, Huantai, Tai'an, and Dong'a, the loyalty and bravery of the local teams fully proved the foresight of the provincial government authorities. However, from another point of view, the existence of these armed forces inevitably increases the burden on the farmers, especially when the area is small and the population is sparse and the management is not good, this situation is even more obvious. The local Pacification Conference has also considered these issues, and has tried to agree on a method of pooling self-defense funds, by which local public opinion organs, fair-minded gentry, and local governments will jointly organize a pooling committee to implement pooling under the three principles of "accurate number of people and guns," "equal burden," and "open management." If this method is implemented effectively, the burden can be more reasonable. However, given the current poverty of the Shandong countryside, the most ideal method is to implement a combination of soldiers and farmers, integrating armed forces and production into one. In other words, local armed forces cannot allow farmers to separate from production. From the current strategy of the bandits, only this method can fundamentally strike at them.

Refugees in Shandong are also a problem that needs to be solved with the assistance of the central government today. The emergency relief work in Yantai and other places in the past was only a temporary emergency measure, and the fundamental problem has not been solved. There are currently 300,000 refugees concentrated in Linyi. Due to the large number of people, the provincial government is unable to cope. There are also 200,000 refugees in Heze and Caoxian in western Shandong, concentrated in the Kaocheng area, crying for food. Past experience has proven that passive relief is of no help. Not long ago, the poverty relief in Ziyang required each beneficiary to walk more than ten miles from the countryside to receive 5,000 yuan in relief funds! The effective and active relief, of course, is to use work as relief, but it cannot be organized on a large scale by local financial resources.

The lives of general public school employees in Shandong can be said to be quite frugal and hardworking. Except for Qingdao, the salaries of public school employees throughout the province are classified in the third category. Compared with Qingdao, if a civil servant in Qingdao can get 1.4 million, Jinan can only get 850,000. Some civil servants in the provincial capital are indignant because prices in Jinan are not lower than in Qingdao. They hope that when the central government adjusts salaries next time, Jinan and Qingdao can be listed as one level. Since Wang Yaowu took charge of Shandong, provincial-level civil servants have been allocated two bags of flour per month at a flat price. The market price is 1.7 million per bag, while the allocated price is only 220,000. In addition, two sets of cotton clothes and two sets of single clothes are issued each year, and one piece of cloth for recommended officials and half a piece for appointed officials. County-level personnel are distributed according to the provincial-level distribution. This welfare system is quite beneficial to public school employees, but according to the person in charge of the finance department, the expenditure on flour allocation is quite large, and whether it can be maintained for a long time in the future is questionable. When the press corps was in Jinan, they inquired in many ways about the suffering of the people. At that time, Liu Maohua, the chief secretary of the provincial government, and Yin Wenjing, the finance minister, replied that apart from the expenses for establishing local armed forces, no other apportionments were allowed. However, the central government allocated very little funding for national defense construction and the fodder for passing troops. Paying for this would inevitably increase the burden on the people in disguise. For example, the encircling moat project in Jinan is huge, and the people bear a large part of the expenses. A request has been submitted to the central government for compensation, but it has not yet been approved. Due to the large distance between the number allocated by the central government and the actual prices, the province has recently levied a special pacification tax on native products such as cotton and peanuts, striving not to conflict with the central government's tax sources. Recently, the central government issued an order to exempt the special tax, and everything is the responsibility of the central government. It is hoped that the central government can approve the number as soon as possible so that the province can prepare in advance. As for the provincial finances, they are extremely difficult. The budget for the first half of this year is 140 billion, of which 80% is for employee salaries, and the remaining business expenses are very few, pitifully small. The impression that the press corps gained in Shandong was that from the provincial level to the county level, the responsible personnel mostly had a clear understanding of the status quo, did not make blind optimism, and their experience and ability were sufficient to cope with this turbulent situation.

### Overseas Chinese Illegitimate Son Executes His Father, Submits to Execution

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 22nd] Ye Youpeng, an affluent overseas Chinese from America, adopted an orphaned Chinese child over a decade ago while in the United States, naming him Ye Dexing. He brought him back to China. However, Dexing neglected his studies and associated with rogues, indulging in gambling, prostitution, and drinking, doing everything wrong. In August of the 1944, he demanded a large sum of money from Youpeng. When refused, he fatally shot his father and fled to Hong Kong and Macau. Inevitably, the long arm of the law caught up with him. Two years later, believing himself to be beyond the reach of justice, he secretly returned to his village. Villagers recognized him, reported him to the police, and he was arrested. He was escorted to the Guangzhou District Court for trial. After repeated interrogations, he was found guilty of patricide, a heinous crime, and sentenced to death. This Guangdong criminal was identified on the 22nd and taken to the execution ground for execution by firing squad. Before his execution, the condemned showed no remorse. He even finished three large bowls of clear wine and four barbecued pork buns before submitting to his fate.

In a gesture of respect for humanity, the Guangzhou Municipal Government has recently ordered all rickshaw companies in Guangzhou to eliminate one-ninth of their total number of rickshaws every three months. Before implementing the elimination, they must submit the license numbers to the Bureau of Public Works for cancellation. The city government will send personnel to oversee the dismantling. Going forward, the numbers will only decrease, and no increase will be permitted.

Guangzhou's food rationing will commence on April 1st. Today, the 22nd, the distribution of grain purchase certificates began. Director Song Ziwen and Mayor Ouyang Ju personally went to the district offices to collect their grain purchase certificates. Citizens enthusiastically collected their certificates. However, some, upon seeing the notice posted at the entrance of the district office stating, "Those with outstanding taxes will not be allowed to collect certificates," dejectedly returned home. It is estimated that residents of Guangzhou with outstanding taxes account for more than half.

The four newspapers representing the official voice, Zhongshan (Central Propaganda Department), Heping (Executive Headquarters), Lingnan (Provincial Party Headquarters), and Guangzhou (Municipal Party Headquarters), have recently received an order from Director Song Ziwen to merge into one publication, to be named "Guangdong Daily". A joint edition will be published on March 29th. However, Zhongshan Daily, established in memory of the founding father of the nation, has a long history, so there are still many technical issues with the merger.

### Hainan Island Miscellaneous News: Draft Evasion Strictly Punished

[Our Haikou Dispatch, 22nd] Wu Biao, the company commander of the New Recruit Brigade reception group of Dan County, was dispatched to Wenchang to receive new recruits. He colluded with Township Head Chen Yuchang in fraudulent activities. Commander Zeng Boyao learned of this and personally went to Wenchang to investigate and found the allegations to be true. Considering that these individuals were reckless and defied the law and disrupted conscription, he ordered their detention and transfer to the ministry for strict punishment. They are currently being interrogated.

Pig Plague, Cattle Plague Harm Farmers

Hainan Island has been lacking rain for several months, and spring plowing in various places is hopeless due to drought. In addition, the pig plague and cattle plague are prevalent. Farmers, due to their adherence to traditional methods and lack of scientific guidance, are suffering heavy losses. If it does not rain, epidemics are very likely to spread, endangering people's lives. It is recorded that a plague broke out in Haikou City in the 26th year of the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty, killing approximately 1,700 people. Since the Republic, there have been three outbreaks of cholera: one killing over 210 people, another killing over 100, and another killing 50 or 60. During the Japanese occupation, great attention was paid to sanitation. A major cleaning was conducted every January or February, and citizens were forced to receive vaccinations and inoculations. Street vending of raw and cold food was strictly prohibited, so infectious diseases rarely occurred. Now, during this severe drought, the various health agencies in Haikou City have not yet taken preventative measures. Even on the main streets and small alleys, filthy water and silt accumulate, with a foul odor filling the air, which has not been thoroughly cleaned. If an epidemic breaks out, the future is unimaginable.

Taiwanese People Stranded Plea to Return Home

Taiwanese stranded on the island after the war were initially retained by various agencies, but have been unable to return to their hometowns. Currently, all agencies have been ordered to reduce their staff on a monthly basis. The retained Taiwanese have been successively dismissed. While some Taiwanese are still retained, their treatment and salaries are meager, barely enough to cover their basic living expenses, causing immense suffering. They earnestly hope that the government will provide them with funds to return home so that they can reunite with their families and seek alternative livelihoods. However, the post-recovery government is preoccupied with the suppression of the rebellion and has been unable to properly handle this matter. The United Overseas Chinese and Taiwanese Association in Hainan will hold a general meeting of stranded Taiwanese in Hainan on April 1st to apply to the special commissioner's office for assistance in returning home.

Qiantang River Tidal Bore to Reclaim 10,000 Mu

Zhu Shaoliang Receives Yi Ethnic Minority Visiting Group

[Our Chongqing Telegram, 25th] Director Zhu Shaoliang received the Yi ethnic minority visiting group at 10:00 this morning. Head of Delegation Sun Fang presented a silver peacock, a saddle, and two pieces of fragrant jade, saying that the visiting group represented millions of Yi people paying their respects to the central government. Subsequently, Major General Luo Renjie of the Xichang Police Department introduced three delegation leaders: Na Zhidayu, Luo Ashizi, and Guo Ji Mada. He mentioned that last year, when the US military was searching for missing airmen, Na led the search deep into the Puxiong Yi area of Ning County, and his spirit was admirable. Luo was brave and skilled in battle and had helped the National Army quell the Mianning opium bandits' rebellion some years ago. Guo had surrendered to the National Army after Sun Fang persuaded him. During the meeting, Guo frankly stated that after arriving in Chongqing for the visit, he realized that the government truly had goodwill toward the Yi people. The three delegation leaders successively swore to Director Zhu that the Yi people were warlike, and if the central government needed them, they would be willing to lead troops to serve, even if it meant sacrificing their lives. Zhu also decided to send six Yi students studying in Chongqing to the Rong Army School for further education. In the evening, the Executive Headquarters' Second Political Department performed a Peking opera to welcome them.

### Greening Shenyang

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 21st] In early spring in the Northeast, the cold is still present, and the Shenyang spring sunshine is beginning to educate people. Students in elementary schools sit on their own small benches or bricks picked up from ruins in the open-air playground, taking a lesson on spring, giving the classroom to wounded soldiers to live in.

The First Mayor of Shenyang After the Takeover

Dong Wenqi, returned to the city government building on March 1st. His first task was to clean up the household registration and launch a anti-spy campaign. This is Shenyang's mental disinfection movement, to eliminate all rumors and germs. According to the household registration statistics, the population of Shenyang is just over one million, a decrease of one-fifth compared to a year ago. In this metropolis of one million people, as many as 310,000 are starving, two-thirds of whom live on soybean cakes, and one-third of whom wander the streets begging. Perhaps no city needs as much pity and sympathy as Shenyang.

Refugees fleeing from all corners of the Northeast are concentrating in Shenyang. They are surprised by what the locals see as faded prosperity, and even more surprised by the shocking prices. A simple meal in a restaurant costs tens of thousands of yuan, or one to two million legal currency. A haircut costs 200,000 legal currency, which is news to them. Among the refugees are many upper-class refugees: landlords, small businessmen, and intellectuals. They bring with them the branding of "cleansing struggles" and mental phobias. These people are mentally vulnerable, selfish, and sad, and a painful experience seems to have taken root in their hearts. The communists use these people to spread mental germs and disrupt people's nerves. The recent retreat from Jilin and the fall of Siping have greatly stimulated Shenyang. According to people from Changchun, in recent days, Changchun has been alarmed several times in one night. In the middle of the night, rumors spread that the national army had retreated. During the day, seeing the well-equipped national army, it returned to normal tranquility. Among these upper-class refugees, many are not used to eating sorghum rice and cry out for hunger.

The food problem makes society uneasy. The March windstorm made the thin, anemic faces of the people of Shenyang even more solemn and worried. In the last few days, prices have jumped three times a day. Rice sells for 11,000 yuan (110,000 legal currency) per catty, and people already turn pale at the mention of "rice." There are many reasons for the soaring food prices. The most powerful stimulus is the result of the panic buying of military rations. In addition, the official devaluation of the circulating coupon to one yuan for ten legal currency, huge amounts of promissory notes disrupting the market, hunger bandits along the way robbing grain trucks, the military arbitrarily seizing vehicles and horses, melting snow making roads muddy, etc., are all important factors. Seeing that the Qingming season is approaching, and looking at the wilderness, all the fields are barren. The seeds of the farmers have been robbed, and the cattle and horses have gone to the front line or are hiding in the city, and there is no way to sow on their own land. This wasted spring is related to the future destiny of Shenyang.

The cry for southern grain to be transported north is as loud as the roar of silver birds. Shenyang is worrying about "northern people transporting south." This is the era of aerial travel frenzy. The business of China National Aviation Corporation in the Northeast is the most prosperous. The doors of the two airlines in Shenyang are extremely busy, with cars and horses, flowers and spring breeze, and elegant ladies all rushing to catch up with the spring in the south. So peddlers and beggars also gather at this luxurious entrance. Every day the silver birds' iron wings make people excited, but strangely, it refuses to bring mail. Green-clad people have not been to our door for half a month. "Beacon fires continue for three months, and a letter from home is worth ten thousand gold." Du Fu's poem now resonates most with the people of Shenyang.

March is coming to an end, and the Northeast in April is visible and beautiful. Mayor Dong has proposed a plan to green Shenyang. His plan is not to decorate Shenyang with exotic flowers and plants, but to green Shenyang with vegetables and radishes. In order to prepare for the years of famine, Mayor Dong calls on citizens to increase production

Every barren field, every vacant courtyard, must be reclaimed and planted with vegetables and grains. If someone does not plow their own courtyard and plant beans, the mayor will order refugees to reclaim your yard. Mayor Dong plans to have the refugees cultivate thousands of acres of wasteland in Beiling and Dongling. These feudal lands, every mid-spring, are green with trees and grass, preserving the beautiful scenery for the Manchu Qing Dynasty to commemorate. This April, people who visit the mausoleums in spring will surely envy the refugees living in a beautiful natural environment! (Our reporter Zhao Zhan)

He hopes that researchers will be more actively involved in research in the future in order to achieve greater success than in the past. Dean Zhang attended despite his illness and delivered a brief speech, saying that China's poverty and weakness were mainly due to a lack of academic research spirit. It is hoped that the election of academicians will stimulate the development of academic research. He further stated that scientific research is based on material, so it should be assisted by the government. Academicians can be selected this time because of the joint efforts of the Ministry of Education and the Academia Sinica. He hopes that after this, the academic research atmosphere will be established and more achievements will be made. The list of academicians nominated by each institute includes: Hu Shi, Lin Kesheng, Hu Xianxiao, Mao Yisheng, Chen Yuan, Chen Zhen, Zhang Yuzhe, Ling Hongxun, Zhuang Changgong, Zhao Jiuzhang, Qian Chongshu, Xie Jiarong, and Luo Zonglu.

### Zhang Boling and Mei Yiqi Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

[The] Nankai University President Zhang Boling and Tsinghua University President Mei Yiqi flew to Shanghai from Beiping yesterday afternoon. They will go to Beijing in the coming days to attend the National Assembly. When President Zhang met with reporters, he said that because of his old age and illness, he had no intention of running for vice president. News reports said that people in the north attach importance to the vice president's place of origin. Zhang did not agree with this. He said: "Since it is an election, there is no distinction between north and south, no distinction between civil and military, otherwise, it is undemocratic." Zhang then, at the request of reporters, expressed his views on the current situation, saying that after the completion of the National Assembly election, the opportunity should be taken to reform politics. Although US aid is not much, it can improve the current economic problems. The most important thing at present is to suppress the rebellion. As a North China native, I cannot bear to see the people of the north in the midst of war for a long time. I will suggest that the government strengthen military power in North China and complete the suppression work as soon as possible.

Korean Industrialist Donates More Than Ten Mu of Land

Zhang then talked about the funding problem of Nankai University, saying that at present all schools are struggling financially, but I am "poor but not making trouble." After Nankai was changed to a national university, all funding was borne by the Ministry of Education, and no more donations were solicited from outside, but donations from alumni and private individuals were accepted voluntarily. Recently, Korean industrialist Sun Changzhi donated three pieces of his private land in Shanghai, totaling more than ten mu. One of them has more than 30 houses. The transfer procedures are currently being processed, and it has not yet been decided how to sell or dispose of them in the future. In addition, Sun also donated more than 100 sets of engineering machinery, which are currently being boxed up in Shanghai and transported north. Zhang also said that the most urgent and common public expense problem for students in the north is the tuition fee. He will negotiate with the Ministry of Education in Beijing this time to find a proper solution.

Finally, the meeting was adjourned after the election of directors and supervisors.

### Scattered Transactions in Woolen Cloth; Yesterday, on Chess Street and at the Tea Party, as well as among major wholesalers, most woolen cloth transactions were scattered and small. The reason is that prices are only rising, which is favorable to buyers who are looking for news; people remain optimistic. However, due to the heavy capital required, each piece requires an average advance payment of around one hundred million yuan, and the interest expense is not small, which makes many hesitant to short sell again. Most are adopting a strategy of supplementing as they sell, so their retail business is larger than wholesale. Yesterday, Zhanghua flannel was quoted at 4.4 to 4.5 million yuan per yard, Lianxing French shirts were sold at 90,000 yuan, and Peifeng white canvas was 280,000 yuan.

Sugar Prices Decline Across the Board; Yesterday, Taiwan Sugar continued to sell its products, including special grade refined white sugar and special grade coarse granulated crystal sugar, but because the distribution price had increased while actual sales were sluggish, coupled with the extreme tightness of credit, the guild's prices declined across the board. For example, the spot price of "24 Rent White" fell from 4.5 million yuan to 4.4 million yuan, "4 Half White" fell from 4.8 million yuan to 600,000 yuan, and "20 Medium Granulated White" fell from 4.1 million yuan to 4 million yuan, a decrease of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Warehouse receipt transactions became increasingly weak; the 12th期 (period) was about to be settled, with a premium of only 300,000 to 280,000 yuan. Some sellers of the 13th期 (period) were willing to transfer unconditionally, with premiums ranging from 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. "4 Half White" had a premium of 100,000 to 120,000 yuan. For the 11th期 (period), coarse granulated sugar was settled today at 250,000 to 200,000 yuan, and "13th Period 4 Half White" had a premium of 40,000 yuan. Furthermore, the price of coarse white sugar was down to a discount of 40,000 yuan, with some even going down by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. Transactions in local sugar were also scarce; Xinghua white sugar was 4.35 million yuan, Xing red sugar was 2.75 million yuan, a decrease of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Hainan red sugar was 2.1 million yuan, a decrease of 100,000 yuan. Shantou Qing sugar was 2.8 million yuan, a decrease of 160,000 yuan. Diao Qing sugar was quoted at the original price but no transactions occurred. In total, less than 200 pieces were offered, and it is said that the market price of local sugar in Shanghai has already been turned upside down.

Tea Merchants Hold Firm; There is still demand for tea for export to French North Africa, and domestic sales of various grades are also quite brisk. However, the buying sentiment in the market remains diffused. Although most merchants still intend to hold firm, they are also being forced to sell due to the increasingly tight credit situation, resulting in a gradual balancing of supply and demand throughout the day. Price fluctuations have narrowed, and prices have generally held steady. However, the special Longjing tea from Meijiawu is experiencing a potential surge due to the imminent depletion of old tea and the new tea not yet being available.

Merchants Seek to Sell for Cash; Rice Prices Continue to Plunge; Flour, Miscellaneous Grains, and Oil Cakes All Decline; As credit continues to tighten, merchants are unable to withstand the pressure of high interest rates and have no choice but to sell their goods for cash. Moreover, prices in Wuxi have also fallen, prices of everything are declining, and market sentiment is universally bearish. With strong selling pressure at the opening this morning, prices plunged by 250,000 to 300,000 yuan. Sales at rice stores are slow, appetite is poor, and the outlook remains sluggish. The decline in the central market has not stopped. Only near the close of trading did some people from the Pudong area and some with available funds take advantage of the low prices to buy, and the market began to stop falling and stabilize, with some even recovering slightly. In the southern market, white粳 (japonica rice) finally fell by 250,000 yuan, and early thin rice also fell by more than 200,000 yuan. In the northern market, white粳 (japonica rice) and 籼米 (indica rice) fell by 150,000 to 200,000 yuan, and thin rice fell slightly by 200,000 yuan. Yesterday, a total of 6,933 石 (dan) of goods arrived in the northern markets.

Flour: Prices have fallen again. Although there were fluctuations in the process, they ultimately declined. There were many transactions in the market, but they were all small, scattered transactions. "Warship Flour" fell from 1.455 million yuan at the opening to 1.425 million yuan at the close, lower than the previous day by 40,000 yuan. "Old Car" flour fell by 25,000 yuan, and "Red Bee" and "Built Success" flours fell by 30,000 to 40,000 yuan each. Various miscellaneous brands of flour also declined, and bran continued to fall by 25,000 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains: The decline continues, and with rice prices falling sharply, it is difficult to boost morale. Even though the cost of soybeans is not low, they must still be sold cheaply due to credit constraints. The early opening price of Zhadou (乍豆) was only 1.65 million yuan, a decrease of 100,000 yuan. However, as buyers entered the market at low prices near the close, the price rose back to 1.74 million yuan. 青島 (Qingdao) group bought few corn, and few people were interested in red sorghum, each falling by 100,000 yuan (red sorghum did not open). Mung beans also fell by 50,000 or 100,000 yuan, sesame prices remained unchanged by 客帮 (merchant groups), a decrease of about 200,000 yuan. Shelled peanuts continued to fall, with high-quality goods falling by a little 300,000 yuan and low-quality goods falling by 200,000 yuan.

Edible Oil: Sales on the street are slow, and there is little restocking. Merchants are eager to sell for cash and are lowering prices to sell, and factories are also making offers. Dayou Soybean Oil Factory opened at 7.25 million yuan, but the buying price fell to 7.2 million yuan. Other soybean oils are mostly at 7.15 million yuan. Dachang New Factory also made offers, but not many, and prices fell by 200,000 yuan. Raw oil also fell by 200,000 yuan, Qingdao 吉桶 (Ji Tong) raw oil was 8.7 million yuan, and raw vegetable sesame oil each fell by a little 250,000 yuan. Small cart sesame oil fell sharply by 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. 客帮 (merchant groups) did not pay attention to soybean cakes. The initial drop was 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, but as soybean prices recovered in the later market, merchants also raised prices, recovering a little 10,000 yuan.

Facilitating Deposits and Withdrawals for Military and Government Agencies; National Banks Decide to Add Receipt and Payment Offices; [This Newspaper's Dispatch] In order to promote and strengthen the control of treasury funds policy, the Council of Directors of the Four Joint Head Offices passed a resolution at its 359th meeting to transfer all existing public funds of military and government agencies in national banks and bureaus to the Central Bank's treasury department for management, and decided to implement it immediately. A few days ago, the Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank specially invited representatives from the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, the Central Trust Bureau, and the Central Cooperative Bank to a meeting to discuss and decide that the six cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Hankou would complete the transfer by the end of March. Because the areas of Beijing and Shanghai are vast, and there are many agencies, the deposit and withdrawal business will inevitably increase sharply after the transfer of public funds. Since various banks and bureaus have many existing branches, in order to facilitate various military and government agencies, it is planned to set up receipt and payment offices in important areas to handle this business. In Shanghai, the Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank plans to set up two receipt and payment offices: one in Hongkou and one in West Shanghai. The Hongkou receipt and payment office will be established first. The office has found a suitable location at No. 1326 North Sichuan Road as its business address, and it is scheduled to open on April 1st. Preparations are currently underway.

More than 60 economic experts and journalists from the city attended, hosted by Mr. Ji Yingding, Director of the office, and Mr. Fang Shangui, Deputy Director. After Mr. Ji gave a brief introduction, Mr. Potts was invited to briefly describe the organizational structure of the Bank of England. According to him, the bank's economic research department is divided into two groups: one is the statistics group, responsible for studying domestic economic and financial trends; and the other is the international group, responsible for studying the international economy. He himself belongs to the international group, specializing in the study of the Far Eastern economy. The main purpose of his visit to China is to collect economic data from your country for research and reference. The business departments of the Bank of England can be divided into four, among which the banking department (i.e., the business department commonly known as our banks) and the issuing department are the most important. The two departments are supervised by the Chief Accountant (Cashier), and the Chief Accountant is also the main officer of the Bank of England, so he also supervises the general business of the Bank of England. The banknotes issued to the public must be formally signed by him. The other two departments are the Foreign Exchange Control Department and the Accounting Department. The Accounting Department's routine business mostly involves bookkeeping and registration. Since the Labour Party came to power, the Bank of England has been nationalized. The bank has been assisting the British Ministry of Finance in its post-war economic reconstruction efforts, adhering to the government's established policies. Therefore, the bank is in an advisory position on British economic policy. Mr. Potts then held a discussion at the request of various economic experts. The tea party ended at about 5:00 pm.

U.S. Restricts Metal Exports; Hong Kong Merchants' 500-Ton Export Permits Revoked; [Hong Kong Aviation News] The export of U.S. metals has been severely restricted recently. That is, anyone who wants to order goods in the United States must first apply to the local government for an export license (Export License) before they can be exported.

It is found that the number of metals ordered by Hong Kong merchants from the United States during this period was about 500 tons, of which a certain large merchant accounted for about 300 tons.

Sluggish Cigarette Trade; Yesterday, the cigarette market opened with active purchases from traders, and ten "Great British" cigarettes were raised to 97.5 million yuan. Later, due to the high-volume sales by traders from other cities, the credit situation in the industry was still tight, and there was a lack of momentum for pulling up prices. In the afternoon, the Great China Cigarette Factory distributed 20 "Horseshoe" cigarettes, and the market was sluggish, and prices fell again.

Rampant Smuggling Between Hong Kong and Japan; Western Medicines Transported to Japan, U.S. Dollars and Gold Brought Back; [Hong Kong Aviation News] In the current Hong Kong-Japan trade, in addition to general goods that have been approved by the governments of both places to trade, smuggling is also extremely rampant. Because these smuggled goods are mostly listed as prohibited imports and exports, the profits are very high. Western medicines such as penicillin, saccharin, and shantonin, which are transported from Hong Kong to Japan, are extremely expensive in Japan. When returning from Japan to Hong Kong, if there are no suitable goods, most people bring back gold and U.S. dollars. Gold and U.S. dollars are also prohibited from free circulation in Japan, so the black market prices are very high. For example, the official exchange rate for U.S. dollars to Japanese yen is 1:50, while the black market rate is about 1:300. According to people familiar with the situation, although the profits from smuggling between Hong Kong and Japan are high, the risks are also great. Exports from Hong Kong are subject to strict inspections. Chinese customs officers also board ships to search when passing through Chinese ports. Inspections are even stricter after arriving in Japan. Various methods are used to land the goods, which are very costly, and there is often a risk of failure. Therefore, the only principle for smugglers is that the goods are light, convenient, easy to carry and hide.

All principal amounts to be repaid for the winning bonds, except for the 26th year of the Republic of China Guangdong-Hong Kong River Project U.S. Dollar Public Bonds, because the additional customs tax on the Guangdong Customs, which was originally designated as the principal and interest fund for the project, was seized by the enemy and puppet forces, and the date of resumption of payment will be determined separately after the fund is cleared. All other types of bonds will be paid by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications of China, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Central Trust Bureau in various places.

New Doctors and New Medicines: Should We Emphasize Quality or Quantity of Medical Personnel? By Canglong; Many, in view of the actual needs, advocate cultivating a large number of medical personnel as quickly as possible to make up for the current lack of medical personnel in China. They also say: No matter what their background is, as long as they can cure diseases, because "having" is always better than "not having."

Of course, those who say these things have their own insights and their own difficulties. Looking at this vast Republic of China, we know that China's medical personnel are so pitifully few, and at the same time, we can imagine how many people in the inland areas get sick and die without proper treatment. If we now want to strictly cultivate general medical personnel according to the original academic system to fill the above-mentioned gaps, then we don't know how many years, months, and days we will have to wait to achieve this goal. Therefore, their proposal is indeed quite reasonable, and I agree with it twelve thousand percent.

However, although this proposal for "quantity expansion" is very reasonable, there are still many difficulties in its implementation. Because in the current China, there are wars and man-made disasters everywhere, and a group of ordinary people have either died or fled, so what technical personnel are there to go to the countryside to die? Therefore, in this "quantity expansion" movement, a group of "bloodsuckers" (with a basis!) are simply added to the cities. We often see many articles criticizing doctors in the newspapers, and we have also heard many rumors that are unfavorable to doctors. Although this cannot be said to be definitely the result of the expansion of quantity, we cannot deny that it is not related. A certain manufacturer once told us that they were unwilling to sell their medicines to doctors with shallow qualifications, because they did not understand the fundamental principles of medicine and did not know how to solve problems when something went wrong. For example! We only need to look at the facts described in the article "Arrow Through the Brain" in this issue to fully reveal the pitifulness of those who have no learning.

Someone will of course retort to me, "According to what you say, you are probably a remarkable doctor yourself"? But that's not what I mean. No one in the world dares to call themselves "knowledgeable," because learning is endless. Today's science is changing with each passing day, and only by working tirelessly and continuing to move forward can we keep up with the trend; otherwise, we will be eliminated by the trend in an instant. Therefore, we must truly understand that if a person's foundation is not well laid, then no matter how much they want to learn well, I am afraid it will be too late. Moreover, it is simply a dream to want that group of "shortcut takers" in the medical field to study, because that group of "shortcut takers" not only cannot study, but also do not want to study. They only think about how to lie and deceive patients, so how can they have time to study those useless things?

Then, what is the result of "quantity expansion"? The result is just a mess. We don't want to give any examples to offend people. We only need to think about the current low status of doctors to understand the reason.

Alas! "Quantity expansion" of medical personnel! How many people have used your good name to commit endless sins? How many people have used your good name to expand their territory and build their thrones?

Nail Protection, By Yu Zhengxing; The Representative of Waste; Everyone has a love of beauty, so everywhere that can express "beauty," people try their best to make it beautiful, so that it is beautiful and modern enough. Look, now some fashionable ladies and social stars are trimming their nails into sharp points, dyeing their backs with nail polish, and adding paint, and the colors are very moving. However, this kind of decoration is of no benefit to people, but it is just a "beautiful" title.

Nails are a part of the skin and are an indispensable thing for human beings. Nails can protect the tender fingertips and assist fingers in picking up small items. Therefore, the beauty of nails should be based on not losing natural functions; otherwise, they are the representative of waste.

The nail body has no vitality, so it has no awareness or feeling. It is composed of hard, smooth, transparent material, which is just a form of what we call "retention material." However, the nail root and its attached parts have nerves and blood vessels. Nails grow not from the edge of the nail, but from the root. Because the root provides new materials. It takes four months to grow a whole nail. Because its growth is extremely slow, it can only grow one thirty-second of an inch per week. As for the growth speed of toenails, it is even slower. The relationship between the nail root and nail growth is the same as the relationship between the hair root and hair growth.

The nail root is very tender and is often destroyed due to blood poisoning and nerve damage. If the nail root is permanently damaged, the nail will no longer grow. If a part of the nail root is damaged, some grooves and ridges will grow on the nail surface, which are often found after suffering from fever or serious illness. Healthy nails are smooth without ridges and have a natural luster.

White lines or spots on the nails are formed by changes in the tissue cells of the nail bed. The cause is malnutrition or a lack of certain vitamins and nutrients. However, sometimes there may be no special reason. The nail root and both sides should be free of hangnails and redness. Paying attention to the skin can avoid hangnails.

Dangerous Enjoyment; When a doctor examines the nails, it has the same value as looking at the tongue and taking the pulse. Healthy nails are a pale rose-red color, which is reflected from the blood color below. Bluish nails are often due to heart disease or circulatory disorders. White, anemic nails are due to insufficient blood. Rough nails are mostly due to a lack of oil secretion in the skin. Irregular, short, thick, or worm-eaten nails are often caused by venereal disease, ringworm, or other chronic skin diseases. There are also other nail irregularities that are often found.

When suffering from swelling nail disease, the pain, redness, and swelling in the wrinkles of the nails must not be ignored, because this disease is mostly caused by systemic physiological disorders or by the spread of bacteria. The most common cause is hangnails. After washing your hands, when the skin is still very soft, use your fingers to push and rub towards the root of the nail, and apply some preservatives. Small sores and breaks near the nails heal very slowly, often delaying for several weeks, but are relatively painless. This may be a possibility of venereal disease and should be consulted by a specialist. Nails are often deformed during the course of typhoid fever, pneumonia, and tuberculosis. When the lungs have chronic diseases, the nails are mostly large and curved. When there are transverse ridges on the nails,

### Peking University's Fiftieth Anniversary - Launching Fundraising to Build Cai Yuanpei Auditorium

[Report from Central News Agency, Nanjing, dated the 24th] Hu Shi launched a fundraising campaign by Peking University to raise 100 billion yuan to build the Cai Jiemin Memorial Auditorium as a gift for Peking University's 50th anniversary. Peking University alumni in Nanjing, such as Di Ying and Yu Yousun, responded enthusiastically. Hu Shi wrote to Peking University alumni in various places, stating: "Peking University, originally known as the 'Imperial University,' is the successor to the imperial academies of past dynasties. The system of imperial academies began in the fifth year of the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty (2035 BC in the Chinese calendar, 124 BC in the Gregorian calendar). We can very well say that Peking University has a history of 2,072 years, making it the oldest university in the world. Although this calculation is inevitably a bit of 'showing off our age,' we have always only counted the Imperial University, which was established in the year of Wuxu during the reign of Emperor Guangxu (14 BC in the Chinese calendar) as the beginning of the new life of our school, and this year marks its 50th anniversary. Teachers, students, and alumni in various places all want to celebrate the anniversary of Peking University, so there are preparations for the 50th anniversary. The methods are roughly divided into two aspects: one is to use the achievements of academic research as a gift, and the other is to establish a public construction for the 50th anniversary. In terms of school achievements, each college has begun to collect the research achievements of each college and has planned various academic publications and lectures. In terms of commemorative construction, we have sought the opinions of alumni in various places, and everyone advocates concentrating efforts to raise donations and build a large auditorium. We feel that a large auditorium that can accommodate one thousand or more people is the most urgent need of Peking University today, so alumni in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places all agree to pool the strength of alumni across the country, raise donations, and build a large auditorium in the Sandatan area, which will be called the Cai Jiemin Memorial Auditorium. We have asked several architectural engineering experts to design it, and roughly calculated that the construction and internal equipment will require 75 billion to 100 billion national currency, which cannot be borne without great strength. We all think that this matter must be promoted by you to have any hope of success, so I, on behalf of the faculty and staff of Peking University and alumni in various places, sincerely request you to take on this matter, and please do not decline."

### Gains from the Automotive Transport Expedition - Wang Shixuan Talks About the Key Points of Basketball Success

[Report from our Chongqing office] The basketball team of the 16th Automotive Transport Regiment, from its first match with the Xingguang team in Guiyang on October 7, 1947, to its 61st match with the Guizhou Sports Association team on February 27, 1948, has been on expedition for more than five months, with 46 matches on the outward journey and 15 matches on the return journey. Except for defeats to the Haihua United and Dagong teams, all other matches were won, which can be considered a successful return.

Wang Shixuan, Deputy Regiment Commander, regretted that the 16th Automotive Transport Regiment only played against the Hualian and Dagong teams once each in Shanghai. He said: "It is not easy for a team from another place to go on an expedition to Nanjing and Shanghai. A team with slightly weaker strength will be struggling and unrewarding." He cited many examples to explain, especially regarding a certain Shanghai newspaper's description of the Gangguang team's trip to Shanghai to participate in the competition as "going to class," and felt deeply moved.

Leader Wang frankly stated the advantages of Hualian and Dagong. His conclusion is worth pondering. He believes that only one Hualian or Dagong team is not terrible. In the two battles, he has already experienced the strength of his own team. Combining his opinions, a successful team must have the following five conditions: First, the players must be tall and energetic. Second, master basic movements. False moves are useless. Third, strive for changes under basic principles. Fourth, use small arm movements in the defense zone, which is not only effortless but also makes it difficult for the opponent to defend. Fifth, do not count success or failure, and play more matches. Therefore, the 16th Automotive Transport Regiment had almost one match every day during the journey, except for taking cars and boats, and even had three matches in one day. The mission of this expedition can be said to be: (1) To create a military sports foundation, (2) To shift the focus of life in the military, (3) To cultivate military sports talents. He always believes that American basketball players are the most standard in the world, and height is the only condition. Unless you score, the ball can always be in the hands of the tall players.

When our reporter asked him: "Did you recruit any new players during this expedition?" He replied: "There is only one Liu Xuekuan in Guiyang, who is particularly tall. With training, he can be cultivated in the future."

In addition to donating 80 million yuan from ticket sales to the Shanghai Sports Journalists Association and winter relief refugees, the 16th Automotive Transport Regiment also donated: (1) 60 million yuan for the construction of the Jieshou Hall stadium in Nanjing, (2) 60 million yuan for the construction of the 9th Automotive Transport Regiment stadium in Hankou, (3) 20 million yuan for the construction of the Youth Regiment stadium in Hangzhou, (4) 70 million yuan for the repair of the Guiyang prison facilities. Fans in Nanjing and Shanghai who love the team can find their tracks again at the Lizhi Society Stadium in Nanjing on April 16. At that time, the basketball team of the 16th Automotive Transport Regiment will represent the Chongqing area's Joint Logistics unit to attend the comprehensive sports meeting held by the General Headquarters of Joint Logistics.

However, due to the continued tight monetary conditions, there was supply at high prices, and the market atmosphere was weak again. Finally, the market closed slightly lower at 170 million yuan, a continued drop of 6 million yuan compared to the previous day. Baoguang and Jincheng both fell by about 7 million yuan. There was a slight appetite for 32 counts of various brands in the market. Except for Lanfeng, which remained unchanged, the prices of Yinyue, Fengnian, and other brands rose by 3 to 4 million yuan. Due to arbitrage transactions, the market trend of 21 counts of Shuangma yarn stopped falling and rebounded. The closing price of a Shuangma voucher was 100.7 million yuan, and the spot price was 110 million yuan, an increase of 7 million yuan. The market for 20 counts of Shuangma yarn turned stronger due to strong demand from Hakka merchants, and the market sentiment was bullish. Prices generally rose by 2 to 4 million yuan. The supply and demand of 10 counts of coarse yarn were balanced, and the price remained stable.

The cloth market was encouraged by the news that the Southern Transport may be opened when it opened in the morning. Longtou fine cloth opened at 4 million yuan. Due to the supplementation from Shanxi merchants and the filling of floating vacancies, the buying spree once unfolded, and the price rose to 4.11 million yuan. Later, after 10 o'clock, some colleagues still had tight positions and sold heavily at high prices. At the same time, dyeing factories rarely asked about low-grade fine cloth, and transactions turned dull. In general, retailers competed to sell each other, and the selling atmosphere in the market suddenly became strong. The price rebounded downstream and gradually fell below the 4 million yuan mark, closing at a low of 3.97 million yuan, an increase of 80,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The rest of the low-grade fine cloth continued to be weak. The prices of Sijunzi gabardine and true tribute cloth rose by 115,000 yuan due to the scarcity and good sales. In addition, Qilin cloth and blue cloth both fell.

Also, it is reported that the Longtou B-character fine cloth supplied by Fangjian Company yesterday was priced at 3.65 million yuan, and many people applied for purchase orders with a price increase of 40,000 to 60,000 yuan. The yarn and cloth management committee did not purchase spot cotton yesterday, and the transaction was not prosperous. However, the trend of yarn and cloth rising and then falling has been hovering. The internal monetary conditions of the industry are tight, and the goods owners have sales, and the foothold is very soft. Fangjian purchased 1,000 dan of cotton seeds yesterday, with a delivery price of 15.3 million yuan in Zhoupu, and a price of 3.82 million to 3.855 million yuan for seed cotton.
