### National Assembly Decides to Postpone Closing; Vice Presidential Election to Continue; Preliminary Results Show Li, Sun, Cheng Leading

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] The inauguration ceremony for the President and Vice President will be held on May 5th at the Presidential Palace, with Wu Jingheng administering the oath.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] The National Assembly is scheduled to hold the second Vice Presidential election session at 9 a.m. on the 24th. Delegates will vote to select one candidate from the top three vote-getters from the 23rd: Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and Cheng Qian. The presidium held a meeting on the evening of the 23rd and decided to appoint Zhang Xiwen as the chairman for the general assembly on the 24th. Whether the general assembly will be held in the afternoon of the 24th will depend on the results and timing of the Vice Presidential election vote count in the morning, and the presidium will hold an ad hoc meeting to decide. The assembly was originally scheduled to close on the afternoon of the 24th, but due to the unfinished Vice Presidential election, it must be postponed. During the presidium meeting on the evening of the 23rd, the issue of postponing the closing was discussed. Because it was impossible to predict whether a Vice President could be elected on the 24th, it was decided in principle to postpone the closing, but the specific duration of the postponement, whether one or two days, was not decided. The Vice Presidential election ballots for the 24th were printed late on the night of the 23rd. The presidium appointed Wang Xingzhou, Ma Shaowu, and Chen Lianfen to supervise the printing and affix their personal seals. The ballots were sealed overnight and will be unsealed in public on the morning of the 24th.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] The first session of the National Assembly's Vice Presidential election was held in the National Assembly Hall on the morning of the 23rd. 2,648 representatives attended. Dai Chuanxian presided. As a result of the election, none of the six Vice Presidential candidates received the statutory number of votes required for election. Li Zongren received 754 votes, Sun Ke received 559 votes, Cheng Qian received 522 votes, Yu Youren received 493 votes, Mo Dehui received 218 votes, and Xu Chuanlin received 214 votes. In accordance with Articles 4, Paragraph 3, and 5 of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law, the Chairman Dai Chuanxian announced upon completion of the vote count that a second election session would be held at 9 a.m. on the 24th to re-vote among the top three vote-getters. After days of intense and heated competition among the six Vice Presidential candidates, the results of the ballot counting at 2:30 p.m. on the 23rd showed that Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and Cheng Qian had achieved initial victory and qualified for the second election.

### Preliminary Vice Presidential Election Situation

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] The Vice Presidential election session on the 23rd began at 9:30 a.m. After the chairman announced the opening of the meeting, Secretary-General Hong Lanyou reported that the Vice Presidential election was conducted in accordance with Articles 4 and 5 of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law and the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election Voting and Ballot Counting Regulations. He explained this repeatedly for 20 minutes. In addition to the election supervisors who were drawn in advance to supervise the distribution of ballots, Yu Bin, Yu Xuezhong, and Su Ting, appointed by the presidium, were asked to monitor the unsealing of the ballots to show solemnity. At 10:05 a.m., after all preparations were completed, Secretary-General Hong announced the closure of all main and side doors of the hall, prohibiting entry and exit. At 10:10 a.m., voting began. Ballots were distributed and elections were held separately upstairs and downstairs. Due to thorough preparation in advance, the voting was orderly and proceeded smoothly. Only during the downstairs voting, a female staff member, Gong Qili, stood in front of the ballot box. When Representative Wang Weizhi and another representative were voting, she showed Wang what was circled on the ballot, causing an uproar among the Guangdong representatives, who shouted the female staff member out of the venue. This briefly caused a moment of commotion, but it calmed down after Wang left. The voting lasted one hour and was completed at 11:13 a.m. After a 20-minute break, the meeting resumed at 11:30 a.m. and the ballot counting process began immediately. At 11:50 a.m., the supervisors unsealed the ballot boxes and began counting the ballots. Wang Enqiao, deputy head of the assembly's documentation group, was appointed as the ballot reader, with the supervisors standing beside him. After each ballot was read, it was handed over to the tally clerks to count the votes. After each box was opened and read, a preliminary tally was made and displayed on the electronic tally board. During the ballot counting, whenever the names of several people were read in succession, applause would erupt in the hall. At the beginning of the ballot counting, Cheng Qian and Li Zongren took an early lead. By the time the eighth ballot box was opened, Sun Ke's vote count began to approach Cheng Qian's. By the time the ninth ballot box was opened, Li Zongren suddenly created a record of 567 votes with a count of 131 votes. After the tenth ballot box was opened, Sun Ke's vote count gradually increased. By 2:10 p.m., the ballot counting was completed. Secretary-General Hong reported that 2,790 ballots were issued today, and a total of 2,785 ballots were cast, of which 23 were invalid, for a total of 2,760 valid votes. Chairman Dai Chuanxian announced the election results after the ballot counting was completed and reported that, in accordance with the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law, another election would be held on the morning of the 24th. The entire hall applauded thunderously. At 2:25 p.m., this tense and heated first Vice Presidential election battle came to a preliminary conclusion.

### Outside the National Assembly: A Scene of Violence

"National Salvation Daily" Vandalized Yesterday; Six Staff Members Injured in Conflict

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] Scenes of violence are emerging one after another at the National Assembly. On the day of the Vice Presidential election, Guangdong representatives and overseas Guangdong representatives vandalized the Nanjing "National Salvation Daily," and several people were injured. As the Vice Presidential election campaign intensified, newspapers campaigned for candidates. Some newspapers maintained a neutral stance, while the opinions of others were inevitably biased. The "National Salvation Daily" had published many articles attacking Sun Ke in recent days. On the 23rd, the newspaper published an editorial titled "Guangdong Representatives Will Not Vote for Sun Ke â€“ A Statement from a Guangdong Representative," which aroused the resentment of the Guangdong representatives. At 11:30 a.m. on the 23rd, after the Vice Presidential election vote, the Guangdong representatives and overseas Guangdong representatives gathered hundreds of people, took two National Assembly buses, and drove to the "National Salvation Daily" on Taiping Road, intending to find the editor-in-chief Gong De'bai to question him. Because Gong was not there, a conflict broke out, and the business department and editor-in-chief's office of the "National Salvation Daily" were vandalized. The Guangdong representatives then took cars to the newspaper's factory in Zeng Gongci and vandalized the machine room and typesetting room. At 12:30 p.m., the Guangdong representatives received reporters in the second-floor lounge of the National Assembly and reported on the incident. According to Gao Xin, Shen Zhechen, and others, they went to question the newspaper and request to see the original manuscript. They sent Zhang Fakui, Shen Zhechen, and Tang Gengcheng representatives to negotiate, but the staff of the "National Salvation Daily" attacked them, which led to a conflict. In the chaos, the newspaper seemed to have been damaged. Gong De'bai, the editor-in-chief of the "National Salvation Daily," said that he was out when the incident occurred and only learned about it after returning. Hu Yunlong, an injured staff member of the newspaper, said that after the Guangdong representatives rushed in, they started beating and vandalizing without negotiating. After the business department was vandalized, they threatened two workers with "death" to lead the way and took cars to the factory in Zeng Gongci. By that time, the factory had already heard the news that the newspaper office had been vandalized. The workers used wooden pillars to block the middle door, but the representatives broke through the middle door, and the machine room, typesetting room, paper cutter, telephone, and other things were completely destroyed. According to police officers who witnessed the scene, the "National Salvation Daily" received threatening letters a few days ago and requested protection. The police station sent 20 police officers to be responsible. At 11:50 a.m. this morning, the Guangdong representatives arrived by car. After getting off the car, they surrounded the newspaper office. Some people went inside, and others blocked the police officers from entering, saying, "You maintain order outside, and we will be responsible for what happens inside." They then took cars to Zeng Gongci. The police officers rushed to the factory on foot. By the time they arrived, the factory had already been vandalized, and the representatives had not yet left. When they saw the police officers arrive, they said, "We'll leave this to you as well," and then left by car, after about an hour. A police officer even produced a list of injured persons that he had investigated, including Liu Xihan, Hu Yunlong, Wu Peiyuan, Shen Junrong, Zhang Xin'sheng, and worker Lv Yufan, six staff members of the "National Salvation Daily". The situation of the newspaper being vandalized was very tragic. The miscellaneous items in each room were messy. In particular, in the typesetting room, all the type racks were scattered, and it was feared that it would not be possible to sort them out in a day or two. However, Gong De'bai declared that he would still try to publish tomorrow.

### New Soviet Ambassador to China, Roshchin, to Depart Soon for the East

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 23rd] The new Soviet Ambassador to China, Roshchin, and his wife will soon depart for China. They completed passport and visa procedures at our embassy in the Soviet Union yesterday. The dispute should not cause more trouble in the legal aspect and increase more difficult disputes. Finally, it was unanimously decided to submit review opinions to the National Government. Regarding the National Assembly representatives, it was believed that "according to the constitutional provisions, the number of regional representatives cannot be increased. If the number of occupational group representatives is increased and supplementary elections are held, it may increase disputes. It is requested that the National Government be advised to find other solutions." Regarding the Legislative Yuan members, it was believed that "increasing the number of members has the same difficulties as the above case. It is proposed to advise the National Government that it can be handled in accordance with the party nomination supplement measures decided by the State Council before the election and the party's previous resolutions on nomination." These two review reports will be submitted to the tenth temporary meeting on the 24th for discussion so that a decision can be made.

### Wei Lihuang and Wan Fulin Hold Inauguration Ceremony

[Our Shenyang Correspondent, 23rd] Wei Lihuang, acting director of the Northeast Headquarters, and Wan Fulin, deputy director, held an inauguration ceremony on the 23rd.

### Zhang Zuoxiang's Remarks

The Current Situation in the Northeast is Not a Matter of People; I Will Go to Take Office as Soon as the Order Arrives

[Our Tianjin Correspondent, 23rd] After the announcement of Zhang Zuoxiang's new position as Chairman of the Northeast Political Committee, he told reporters on the 23rd: "The crisis in the Northeast is deep. The current issue is a matter of events, not a matter of people. Military strength must be strengthened so that politics can develop and coordinate. I will go to Shenyang as soon as the clear order arrives." Zhang said that he was born a soldier. If he has the power to fight, it is his duty to the country and the region. What the future holds depends on whether the Central Government has a solution. Zhang sighed that the local and puppet Manchukuo forces were not well controlled after the victory, which led to them falling into the hands of bandits, resulting in the current situation. He believes that the cultivation of local armed forces in the future must be supported by the Central Government.

### Bandits in Southern Liaoning Flee to Yingkou

Foreign News Reports That Two Bandit Columns Have Entered the Pass

[Our Shenyang Correspondent, 23rd] Military News: (1) After being attacked by the National Army, the independent 5th, 6th, 7th, and 3rd Divisions of bandits southwest of Liaozhong (place name) fled to Yingkou. (2) There are no traces of bandits within 25 kilometers southeast of Changchun. (3) After the National Army put pressure on the bandits north of Yixian in western Liaoning, they fled to the area of Qinghebianmen in northern Zhen.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 23rd] It is reported that the communist bandits are moving south on the west side of the Beining Railway. Two columns have already entered the Pass, and another independent brigade is moving from the east side of the Ping-Shu Railway towards Shanhaiguan, intending to isolate the protruding point of the Northeast National Army or even disrupt the Ping-Tian area.

### More Than 1,000 Bandit Ships Seized in Jingjiang Binjiang Reeds

[Our Nantong Correspondent, 23rd] A certain Jingjiang Suppression Corps recently seized more than 1,000 small wooden bandit boats in the reeds of Jingjiang southwest Binjiang, which have been sent to Chadi for reorganization and utilization.

### Provincial Finances to Be Adjusted; Ministry of Finance Drafts National, Provincial, and County Tax Division Method for Approval; Increase Allocation of Local Tax Sources to Enable Self-Sufficiency

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] After the implementation of the constitution, the central government will have new adjustments to the finances of each province so that each province can achieve financial self-sufficiency as an autonomous unit. The Ministry of Finance has now drafted a "National, Provincial, and County Tax Division Method" and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. The content is to redistribute the current tax sources and greatly increase the allocation of local tax sources to enable self-sufficiency. The method also has detailed regulations on the percentage of land tax and business tax allocated to the provinces.

### Chairman Personally Visits the Venue to Hear About the Election Situation, But Does Not Cast Vice Presidential Election Ballot

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] Chairman Chiang visited the venue during the Vice Presidential election on the morning of the 23rd, but did not attend the general assembly. The Chairman arrived at 9:10 a.m. and sat in the presidium lounge to listen to the progress of the election. He did not vote during the election. Before leaving the venue, the Chairman summoned Wu Zhongxin and asked him some questions.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Chairman Chiang and his wife drove to the private residence of President Yu Youren of the Executive Yuan on the afternoon of the 23rd to visit Mr. Yu. Yu was out at the various National Assembly representative reception centers, thanking the representatives for their enthusiasm in helping with his election campaign. Therefore, he was unable to meet with the Chairman and his wife.

### Supplementary Measures for National Assembly and Legislative Yuan Elections; Legislative Yuan Proposes Review Opinions; Submitted to the Tenth Temporary Meeting for Discussion and Decision

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 23rd] The Legislative Yuan held its ninth temporary meeting at 11:20 a.m. on the 23rd. Chairman Sun Ke discussed the supplementary measures for the first National Assembly and Legislative Yuan elections passed by the State Council on the 22nd. These two measures were ordered by the National Government to the Legislative Yuan to revise the relevant election laws and regulations. However, the attending committee members, including members of both the Min and Qing parties, believed that the method of using legislative procedures to solve political problems violated the spirit of the rule of law. At the beginning of this constitutional government, they repeatedly emphasized that it was not possible. Moreover, there were many difficulties in increasing the number of occupational groups and holding supplementary elections. One was the issue of the candidates' membership, the second was the issue of the occupational groups nominating their own candidates, the third was the issue of holding elections, the fourth was the issue of controlling the number of votes, and the fifth was the issue of allocating the newly added seats. Therefore, whether these two measures can resolve disputes and appease people, so that those who should be elected can come out, is not certain. It is possible that it will cause more disputes and destroy the law. Tan Tiwu also pointed out that the various regulations in the supplementary measures could not eliminate all the disputes of concession, and the election was delayed for too long, which inevitably caused problems. In particular, the regulations on attendance were even more neither fish nor fowl. She advocated that the government should determine the principle rigidly. Those who get more votes should be elected in accordance with the law. Those who are formally nominated by political parties as candidates should also be elected in accordance with the situation. Zhang Zhaoyuan also said: "Mistakes are inevitable on the road to democracy, but knowing that we have made a mistake, we cannot make the mistake worse and make it impossible to recover." He and Di Ying and others advocated that it be submitted for review first, and then a serious decision should be made. Sun Ke also generally agreed with the views of the committee members, but because the authorities intended to make this case legally established before the closing of this National Assembly, so that the Legislative Yuan could meet reasonably, the implementation of the constitution would not be affected. It is not impossible to make another suggestion, but it is feared that time will not allow it. The original intention of the Legislative Yuan was that the National Assembly part could be resolved by the National Assembly itself, but in the end it was discussed by the Legislative Yuan. After reporting on the State Council's discussion and passage of the case, he asked the committee members to reconsider. In the end, because the matter was of great importance, it was decided to hold a review meeting first, and then hold a general meeting for discussion. The meeting adjourned for a while. A plenary review meeting was reconvened at 4 p.m. Liu Kejun presided. Lu Fu, Chen Ruxuan, Chen Xiaocen, and others expressed their opposition to the two cases. Lu Fu explained that the constitution and general laws and regulations have very strict restrictions, and there is really no way to think of it from the legislative aspect. The way to solve the problem should be sought from the party and government that caused the dispute. Chen Ruxuan appealed that the Legislative Yuan is about to end, and it must not commit crimes knowingly and make itself a laughingstock. Chen Xiaocen emphasized that he had made a similar suggestion three weeks ago, but it was not discussed because it was not convenient to intervene. Now that the problem has been delayed until now, the National Government's move is just like a joke. He pointed out that there are only two ways to respond to the National Government for the two cases: to report that there is no way to think of it, or to suggest Tan Tiwu's method. Li Qing, Shi Ze, and others also said that now there is only the party and the government.

### National Army Moves South from Yan'an and Arrives at Ganquan; The War in Central Shaanxi Becomes Tense; Bandits in Western Hubei Stir Again But Have Been Repulsed

[Our Xi'an Correspondent, 23rd] The National Army moving south from Yan'an has arrived near the county seat of Ganquan. It is reported that the movements of He Long's bandit troops in eastern Longdong are very noteworthy. There is a large group of bandits harassing Jingchuan, 20 miles east of the border between Gansu and Shaanxi. He Long is commanding in Huanxian, and his troops are gathering. Yesterday, a part of Wang Zhen's Second Column of bandits north of the Wei River crossed the river south from the territory of Wugong County to Changxing Town in Mei County. In addition, there was contact northwest of Qian County and northeast of Liquan County. The Fifth Regiment of bandits who attacked Zhangjiabao, north of Qian, was completely wiped out by the National Army on the 22nd. The garrison troops in Linyou have moved their positions. The National Army in Baoji repulsed a group of bandits attacking from the west on the 23rd. The Longhai Railway between Jiangzhang and Changxing (between Wugong and Fufeng Counties) was damaged. On the 23rd, westbound trains only ran a shuttle to Wugong. Pujijin, east of it, was once attacked.

[Our Chongqing Correspondent, 23rd] Xunyang in southern Shaanxi has been lost. The National Army is fighting fiercely with the bandits near Muzhutan on the border between Xunyang and Ankang Counties. In addition, Zhao Shoushan's bandit troops have fled to Mao Caoping in Zhen'an. In addition, a group of bandits in central Hubei has captured Yuan'an (north of Dangyang).

[Our Changsha Correspondent, 23rd] The bandits in western Hubei are stirring again, attempting to attack Hao Xue and Shashi. The bandits attacking Hao Xue were 8 miles away from Hao, but were defeated and retreated after being shelled several times by the Yongji warship. The bandits attacking Shashi once fled to within 15 miles of Shashi, but were also repulsed by the National Army ground troops in coordination with warships.

[Our Hankou Correspondent, 23rd] The bandit troops in the Dahongshan area of central Hubei have recently gathered and stirred again. The local air force dispatched a powerful formation on the 22nd to bomb the northeast of Jingshan, killing more than 200 bandits and destroying most of the bandit troops' fortifications. (More news about bandit suppression will be published on page 2.)

### National Assembly Chronicle: Preliminary Vice Presidential Election

[Our Special Correspondent] The Vice Presidential election competition unfolded today at the National Assembly Hall, the arena of democratic politics, with preliminary displays of skill. All six candidates seemed well-prepared, giving the impression of equal strength. Early in the morning, on the way to the National Assembly Hall, slogans promoting the candidates fluttered in the wind, each with its own appeal. Inside the venue, campaign materials of various colors fluttered in every corner, some as frank as "Please vote for me!" Most noticeable was Li Zongren, fully armed, greeting and shaking hands with people at the entrance of the National Assembly Hall. Also noteworthy was Mrs. Li Zongren, Guo Dejie, urging, "Please elect Mr. Li!" Perhaps this was somewhat successful, as the preliminary results showed Li Zongren taking the lead.

The Democratic Testing Ground

The Vice Presidential election was more enthusiastic than the Presidential election, and the enthusiasm revealed a strong tension. For this preliminary round, the presidium of the National Assembly selected the highly respected President of the Examination Yuan, Shi Jitao, to serve as chairman for the day. When he sat solemnly on the chairman's seat in his blue robe and black jacket, the representatives all had the same thought: "Today, we have come to the democratic testing ground."

The election voting procedure was clearly more skilled than the previous two times. After the Secretary-General read out the names of the representatives invited to serve as ballot distributors, ballot counters, and other supervisors, the various segments proceeded quickly. From the time the Secretary-General announced the start of ballot distribution at 10:10 a.m. to the time the first representative cast the first ballot into the ballot box, only a little over a minute passed. From that time until the last ballot was cast, it took a total of one hour. All the ballots were also sealed. More than 2,000 ballots were cast calmly, with only a few representatives showing their marked ballots to others to show their sincerity, which caused dissatisfaction among other representatives and led to a minor commotion. This was the only minor disturbance in the venue today.

The ballot counting procedure for the Vice Presidential election had an additional step: reading the ballots aloud. Many people said that those with heart conditions should not sit here. The twelve ballot boxes were opened one by one, and each ballot was read aloud. The candidates were startled each time their name was read. The ballot counting began at 11:30 a.m., and the reading of the ballots began at 11:45 a.m. Each word and sentence tightened everyone's heartstrings. The preliminary results showed that Li Zongren, Sun Ke, and Cheng Qian had qualified for the second round, with Li receiving the most votes, followed by Sun, and then Cheng Qian. Yu Youren was behind Cheng and lost his qualification for the second round. In the statistics for the twelve ballot boxes, the results of the first ballot box showed Li and Cheng leading, followed by Sun in third place. Later, the results of the second, third, and fourth ballot boxes showed Li Zongren still leading, but the distance between Cheng and Li gradually narrowed. Although Sun was still in third place, he was gradually falling behind in proportion. When the fifth ballot box was opened, Cheng Qian took the lead by five votes more than Li. Sun was still in third place. When the sixth ballot box was opened, Li regained the lead by one vote more than Cheng. From then on, Li never retreated. When the ninth ballot box was opened, Li was far ahead, and Sun also jumped out of third place to become the runner-up. At this time, Cheng's cheerleaders could not help but give a sarcastic applause, but Sun was only nine votes ahead. By the time the eleventh ballot box was opened, Li's vote count had broken the 700 mark, while Cheng had not yet exceeded 500. Finally, when the twelve ballot boxes were opened, Li won the championship, Sun the runner-up, and Cheng came in last. This tense situation lasted from 11:45 a.m. to 2:10 p.m. The more than two hours was not a short time, and the scene was quite wonderful, with the cheers of the competing cheerleaders rising and falling.

Unexpected Events

Among the various campaign materials at the venue today, two were particularly eye-catching: one was the "Who Will Win the Championship" portrait from the "Nanjing People's Daily," and the other was the editorial "Guangdong Representatives Will Not Vote for Sun Ke" in the "National Salvation Daily." The former was more interesting, while the latter angered the Guangdong representatives. As the tense ballot counting was underway inside, the vandalization of the "National Salvation Daily" unfolded, creating an even more tense scene. After completing their task of casting their votes, the Guangdong representatives went to the "National Salvation Daily" to question and vent their anger, and the "National Salvation Daily" was eventually vandalized. Does this incident provide a significant irony to the democratic politics that unfolded today?

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] He Min, a farmer representative from Shanxi, wore a short blue cloth jacket with a front opening and blue cloth pants, making him the most simply dressed person in the entire venue. When this gentleman left the voting booth, he told people, "I circled four people in total," seemingly quite pleased with himself. Little did he know that he had actually "cast a void ballot."

The visiting foreign diplomats praised the orderly conduct of the election and the "calm and cheerful atmosphere" displayed by the representatives.

### Editorial: Expanding the Rationing of Readily Available Supplies

The manufactured goods that the government has purchased were first put up for auction by the Central Trust Bureau, including items such as coal briquettes, soap, matches, cement, and other items, most of which are daily necessities for the people. The auction was conducted through open bidding, with the highest bidder winning. However, for some reason, it is said that the auction was not successful at the time. We sincerely hope that this auction method can be improved.

When the government ordered the Four Banks to purchase finished products between January and February of this year, after the industrial loan program was suspended, it originally had two purposes: one was to replace industrial loans so that manufacturers could cope with the urgent needs of the Lunar New Year, and the other was to control materials, especially general daily necessities, to suppress prices. Whether this high-priced auction method is consistent with the original intention of suppressing prices is worthy of further discussion.

To suppress prices, the government has in the past released major items such as rice, yarn, cloth, and gold. The effect of this is debated, but the sale price was always somewhat lower than the market price. Even for items such as sugar, coal, cooking oil, and flour, which were only rationed and not sold, the rationed price was far below the black market price. Therefore, in terms of results, it had a considerable effect in alleviating the continuous rise in prices. Even if adjustments were made from time to time and prices could not be completely controlled proactively, it would at most only follow the black market, which is very different from leading the price increase.

Now, the method of open bidding with the highest bidder winning has a very different effect, because it is completely based on the market price, and completely based on the highest market price. According to the bidding instructions, only the lowest reserve price is stipulated, and there is no maximum limit. Moreover, if a bidder who does not reach the highest bid price this time needs to purchase the remaining quantity of the same product, it will also be calculated at the highest price. Therefore, under this open bidding method, in reality, only price increases are allowed, and price suppression or leveling is not allowed. How this method can be reconciled with the original principle of controlling materials and suppressing prices is difficult to understand.

I remember that when the purchase of finished products first began, many people were skeptical, believing that this alternative to loans was no different from taking advantage of people's difficulties and competing with manufacturers for materials. After the purchase, it was no different from changing merchants' hoarding into official hoarding, and the so-called suppression of prices was nothing more than empty talk, and it was unlikely to happen in reality. If we take the highest-priced auction method as an example, wouldn't it be unfortunate that their words came true?"

The deadline for various banks and bureaus to accept applications for the purchase of finished products was February 7th of this year. At that time, the wholesale price index in this city was only between 200,000 and 240,000 times the base, but now it has risen to more than 500,000 times. In just two and a half months, it has risen by about one and a half times. Using the funds of national banks and bureaus as capital, without having to spend too much interest and risk, this business is indeed very profitable. However, since the profits are thick and the income is large, if the interest rate is slightly reduced and the method of selling at parity prices is still adopted, the national treasury would only earn a few cents less, and the general price level could be slightly stabilized, or at least not be stimulated by it. Then, not only would people's lives be benefited invisibly, but also the national credibility and the value of the currency would all receive good effects.

Regarding the issue of the cost of living index for workers, because the increase has been too drastic, manufacturers cannot bear it and have requested changes. The only reasonable solution that everyone believes is to start with expanding rationing, so that the index can be more stable, and workers can avoid unexpected problems. The problem is, where can these materials be obtained? The relevant authorities have held many meetings, but there is no concrete solution, and it seems that this route is still blocked. We believe that since the number of finished products obtained through purchase is not small, and among the originally scheduled seventeen kinds of finished products, fourteen kinds are daily necessities for the people, and these necessities are currently firmly in the hands of the government, then, it is only necessary to change the original plan of selling at the original price and follow the example of rice, cooking oil, sugar, etc., to give priority to supplying rations, and this problem can be easily solved. We wonder whether the recent labor-management appraisal meeting in this city resolved to request government assistance regarding the issue of expanding the rationing of materials. We believe that the most convenient way to provide assistance is to use this batch of finished products that have already been purchased and hoarded in warehouses.

This will of course entail considerable losses for the government, but as mentioned above, at most, it will only earn a few cents less, and it will not really lose money or deplete its legitimate profits. Moreover, expanding rationing is an established policy of the highest authorities, and various localities are vigorously promoting it. Even the supplies donated by the Allied nations and some of the products of merchants are also being coordinated separately to jointly assist in its realization. We have no reason to believe that this batch of purchased finished products, originally intended to suppress prices, must all be excluded and sold to bidders who are willing to pay the highest price. Mr. Patrick, the representative of the American side of the Sino-American Relief Materials Committee, stated in his work report, based on the opinions of his experts, that "in order to exert its full strength, the government should strive to achieve real improvement in the utilization of major necessities of life produced domestically and imported, supplemented by appropriate price controls." (See yesterday's newspaper) The real improvement in utilization referred to by Mr. Patrick undoubtedly refers to the supply of rations. Moreover, if these domestically produced necessities of life are sold using the highest-priced auction method, then there will be no supplementation of appropriate price controls. Therefore, this highest-priced auction method, whether based on expanding rationing or controlling prices, should be carefully considered.

### U.S. Economic Adjustment Agency Prepares to Implement Aid to China Plan; Shanghai American Business Community Hopes to Participate

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] The European Recovery Agency, which also manages aid to China, has now been formally renamed the Economic Adjustment Agency. Authorities at the agency announced today that they have begun deploying personnel to implement the aid to China plan, but aid to China funds will not be submitted to the Appropriations Committee until the decision on aid to Europe funds is made. After the negotiations between China and the United States reach an agreement, the aid to China portion of the agency can begin work. Although the nature of the aid to China has not been specified by the agency, officials said that it will focus on providing loans to support China's economic construction, rather than engaging in relief efforts through grants. The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai has requested permission for American businessmen familiar with the situation to participate in this plan through voluntary assistance, emphasizing the welfare of the Chinese people and cultural undertakings. It is said that economic recovery is important, but the interests of the United States in China should extend beyond the economic scope and be broadly considered, especially paying attention to organizations established in China on a voluntary basis and educational and religious undertakings supported by the United States. These groups feel oppressed by bureaucratic authorities, the same as merchants. The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai also suggested that "the future of American cultural cooperation in China clearly includes mutual aid programs initiated by American private individuals, and the American government should provide full support when these private cultural and religious groups struggle to survive. The Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce should also organize an advisory committee to assist the work of the Economic Adjustment Agency. The director of the agency should also be given the authority to approve import permits for goods aided by the United States issued by the Chinese import authorities for regulation." A. B. Coleman, director of the Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce, is scheduled to return to Shanghai on Monday. It is said that the Economic Adjustment Agency is giving sympathetic consideration to this proposal from the Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce.

### Defenses of the Dabashan Mountains on the Border of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei

â€” Special Correspondent Ouyang Chun of this Newspaper

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 18th (Airmail)] Since the bandit troops of Kong Congzhou infiltrated and captured Baihe County in the Hubei-Shaanxi border area on April 1st, and then besieged Xunyang along one route and fled south to Shuanghekou, Deshengpu, and Tanjiahe in western Hubei along another route, controlling the two counties of Zhuxi and Zhushan, the defenses of the Dabashan Mountains on the border of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei have suddenly become a matter of concern for people across the country. The Dabashan Mountains stretch for more than a thousand li from Guangyuan in the north to Wuxi and Wushan in the east. In the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the communist bandit Xu Xiangqian's troops harassed Tongjiang, Nanjiang, and Bazhong, infiltrating through Zhuyu Township in Tongjiang and Wanyuan counties, along Guanba Township and Gunlongpo, capturing Wanyuan, Chengkou, Xuanhan, and Dazhou, lasting for two years. The National Army's defense in the Dabashan Mountains began in October of last year. The communist bandits once infiltrated Ankang in southern Shaanxi, and the Chen-led troops of the Youth Army were dispatched from Chongqing to Danzhong to recover it. If they had taken the opportunity to join forces with the Chen-led troops to pursue and attack Kong's bandit lair in Yunxi County, the situation on the border of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei today would not be so serious.

There are three main routes for the communist bandits to infiltrate Sichuan: (1) Gunlongpo, which is only sixty li from Wanyuan County and is the closest rocky path to Zhenba in southern Shaanxi. Gunlongpo is 1,000 meters above the ground and has a precipitous terrain, with sheer cliffs. In the 35th year of the Republic (1946), Luo Guangwen's troops used this route to leave Sichuan to suppress the bandits. At that time, many people and horses fell and died because the path had not been paved properly. Now, it is still impassable when it rains. Cotton merchants from Zhenba must pass through Gunlongpo to enter Sichuan. The Yiyang troops are troubled by the fact that they cannot inspect the merchants carrying goods back and forth. Intelligence officers have already found pistols hidden in the cotton. Furthermore, the merchants and civilians who carry yellow paper out of Sichuan can reveal all the defenses. Transportation between southern Shaanxi and northeastern Sichuan is inconvenient, and rumors are enough to affect morale and the overall situation. Therefore, even though it is known that there are bandits mixed in, it is impossible to seal the border. (2) A branch road from Lishuxi to the northeast through Pihuo Pu to Dazhu River is the main route for entering Sichuan from Ziyang. The locals call this road "Ren Ba Yan [People Climbing Rocks]." (3) Entering Sichuan through Jixinling in Wuxi County.

This reporter has personally observed the defenses of the Dabashan Mountains and can confirm that they are indeed as solid as a rock. However, in addition to the three main routes listed above, there are still fifteen small paths on the border of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei. The communist bandits are cunning and always avoid the strong and attack the weak, which is worth our attention.

In response to the communist bandits' attempt to infiltrate Sichuan, the Chongqing Xingyuan (Provisional Headquarters) established two command posts in Guangyuan and Dazhou, respectively, led by Generals Huang Yin and Fang Jing. According to observations by relevant authorities, the communist bandits' biggest goals on the border of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei are still: (1) Along the Xunyang, Ankang, Ziyang, and Zhenba lines, attack Guangyuan to control Chengdu. However, with the recent sitting of Lieutenant General Luo Guangwen, commander of the Fourth Corps and director of the Tenth Training Department, in Hanzhong, the communist bandits' plan will definitely be shattered. (2) After capturing Zhuxi and Zhushan, continue to flee south to block the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.

Currently, in addition to the threat of communist bandits, there is also a serious opium bandit problem plaguing the border areas of Wanyuan and Chengkou in Sichuan, and Ziyang and Langao in Shaanxi. The famous Liu Ba Dao He and Dajieling have become "no man's lands" because they are adjacent to four counties. The famous opium bandits include Zeng Ce'an (from Shaanxi), Chen Yutang, Chen Kaiguo, and Xiong Jiwu (from Sichuan), who possess hundreds of guns and have seriously harmed local security. According to Wanyuan County Magistrate You Weitan, the four county magistrates have decided to hold a meeting in Dazhu River on April 25 to thoroughly eliminate opium and survey the boundaries.

The potential of the communist bandits in Sichuan must not be underestimated. Bandit leaders Zhu De, Wang Weizhou, Liu Bocheng, and Chen Geng all grew up in Sichuan. After Zhou Enlai, Ye Jianying, and others withdrew from Chongqing in the 34th year of the Republic (1945), they dispersed bandit party cadres to various counties in the countryside. Chairman Wang Lingji inspected this issue on the second day (6th) of his arrival in Chongqing from Xunyang. According to reports, the young children who were abducted by Xu Xiangqian's bandit troops from various counties in northeastern Sichuan in the 24th year of the Republic (1935) have now grown up and returned as infiltrators.

Lieutenant General Luo Guangwen, commander of the Fourth Corps, served as the commander of the Fourteenth Army in Chongqing during the war and was responsible for suppressing bandits in Sichuan. He said that it is impossible to eliminate bandits without implementing the "three killings" policy. His three killings policy is:

(1) First, kill undisciplined officers and soldiers.

(2) Second, kill township and town chiefs who collude with bandits.

(3) Finally, kill all the bandits.

### Six Arab Nations Plan to Send Regular Troops as Reinforcements; Situation in Pakistan is Serious; British Attempt to Mediate in the Haifa Conflict Again

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 23rd] Britain will make another mediation attempt on the 23rd to get the Jews and Arabs in the Haifa area to agree to a truce. The previous truce talks broke down last night after 24 hours of intense fighting between the two sides. The Palestinian government stated today that British troops should withdraw from Palestine as quickly as possible and do not want to be involved in disputes with either side. However, if anyone interferes with their withdrawal, British troops will not tolerate it.

[United Press, Haifa, 22nd] The Jewish underground army today controls Haifa and has proposed peace terms, demanding that all Arabs disarm. The Arab side believes that it is difficult to accept these terms and is preparing to withdraw from here. At the same time, all of Jordan's and most of Iraq's and Syria's supplies are imported from Haifa. Now that the port has been occupied by the Jewish army, the Arab countries may intervene entirely. According to Arab spokespersons, King Abdullah of Jordan will not allow Haifa to fall into the hands of the Jews. According to news from Cairo, the governments of the six Arab countries have agreed to send troops to Palestine on May 16 for large-scale operations unless the United Nations can produce an acceptable solution beforehand. The Arab League admits that it has underestimated the strength of the Jewish army. Da Mase Guangbao and Liang Di Telegram also stated that Jordan may send Arab troops to participate in the war. It is reported that Arab volunteers have entered Pakistan to provide reinforcements. Ten to fifteen thousand Arab residents of Haifa have gathered at the port waiting to be sent to Acre. British authorities stated that another 18,000 to 25,000 people will also be evacuated. Arabs must surrender all weapons at the time of departure. On May 15, when Britain ends its mandate, the British will transfer them to the Jewish underground army as spoils of war.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 22nd] Although the main Arab defense works in the port of Haifa have been broken, the Arabs are still resisting stubbornly. The Haganah army continues to provide reinforcements to defeat the final Arab resistance and occupy the entire port. Arab women and children have boarded small boats from the port and evacuated to Acre in the north. The truce talks between the Jews and Arabs in the Haifa area will continue on the morning of the 23rd at 11:00 a.m. Haifa has a population of 145,000, with Arabs accounting for slightly more than 40%. According to the Palestine partition plan, Haifa should be an Arab port.

[Reuters, Damascus, 22nd] Syria has instructed its representative to the Political Committee of the Arab League in Cairo to demand that regular Arab troops be sent to Palestine immediately, before Britain ends its mandate over Palestine. Iraq's Regent Elah left for Amman on the 22nd to discuss plans to aid Palestine with King Abdullah of Jordan. Elah will stay in Amman for ten days. The Iraqi Minister of Finance, the Minister of Defense, and Chief of Staff General Saeed will all participate in the talks. Earlier, General Shafwat, commander of the Arab Liberation Army in Palestine, stated that although the Arab army in Palestine can continue to fight, it urgently needs the practical assistance of the Arab League countries. He advocated sending regular Arab troops to the Holy Land to establish peace and order.

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] President Truman said at his weekly press conference today that the United States is willing to provide some military force to organize a United Nations police force to be sent to Palestine.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] The Foreign Office and the Colonial Office both denied knowing of the presence of Soviet troops in Palestine.

### US Asks British Troops to Continue Staying in the Holy Land; British Government Has Refused; Suggestion of US Trusteeship is Being Considered

[This Newspaper] London, 23rd Broadcast: A Foreign Office spokesman said that Britain is considering President Truman's proposal regarding Palestine, but denied that the Holy Land issue was discussed at yesterday's cabinet meeting, and strongly stated that Britain's attitude towards the Holy Land has not changed. The "Star" claimed that the British cabinet has rejected the US request for British troops and administrative personnel to continue staying in Palestine after May 15, but Britain may support the US proposal for the United States, Britain, and France to jointly administer Palestine.

[This Newspaper] New York, 23rd Broadcast: Success Lake News, British representative Jones gave a speech to the UN Political Committee today. He did not directly answer the US proposal to place Palestine under trusteeship but said that Britain might consider this proposal. He also said that there are only 25 days left before Britain withdraws from the Holy Land, and the United Nations must quickly find a way to stop the war in the Holy Land.

[Reuters, Success Lake, 22nd] The UN Political Committee resumed debate on the Palestine issue today. French representative Baroti requested immediate measures to make Jerusalem a refuge for refugees. Mr. Ba proposed a resolution requesting the Trusteeship Council, in consultation with the mandatory power and related countries, to take all necessary measures to protect the city of Jerusalem and its residents.

Yugoslavian representative Virfen opposed the US's proposed trusteeship plan for Palestine. Australia requested the United Nations Palestine Committee to immediately establish a provisional government committee and organize a militia, and requested the Palestine Committee to join this provisional government committee in taking over the administrative responsibilities of Palestine starting on May 15. Ukrainian representative Tarasenko demanded the implementation of partition and firmly opposed the trusteeship plan. Brazilian representative Muniz supported the trusteeship plan and pointed out that in order for this solution to be effective, a powerful country directly related to the Palestine issue must establish an agreement to implement the trusteeship plan. Otherwise, the plan may have little hope of success. Jewish Council Executive Member Sherfer accused the mandatory authorities of refusing to cooperate in implementing the partition plan and even failing to take responsibility for local security. He believed that it was already too late to implement the trusteeship system now, because the Arab countries are prepared to take even larger-scale military action after the end of the mandate. Delaying a solution can only make the situation worse.

### Hu Shize Discusses the Need for Reunification of North and South Korea in Pyongyang

Pyongyang Conference May Have Little Hope of Success

[This Newspaper, Peiping, 23rd] Hu Shize, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations and Secretary-General of the Korean Commission, commented on the Korean issue in Pyongyang today, saying that, in essence, this is a US-Soviet problem. The internal situation in Korea is also quite complicated, so the North-South conference in Pyongyang has little hope of success. The South Korean general election on May 10 will still be held as planned. Hu pointed out that the Society for the Promotion of Independence led by Syngman Rhee in North Korea and the Democratic Party led by Kim Shin-sook are both powerful majority parties, and neither of them participated in the North-South conference. The Pyongyang conference will inevitably produce some conditions for the union of the North and South. Whether these conditions can be accepted by the two parties mentioned above, and even whether Kim Koo and Kim Kiusic agree, is also a question. But he still strongly stated that the agricultural South Korea and the industrialized North Korea need each other to complement each other, and it is necessary to unify. When asked if the people of South Korea were satisfied with the rule of the United States, Hu replied: The Koreans have a strong sense of patriotism and are disgusted with the control of the United States and the Soviet Union in North and South Korea. Hu has not returned to China for three years and has not been to Peiping for fourteen years. This time, he returned to China to sweep his father's grave in the north. He will stay for a few more days and then go to Shanghai. Whether he will go to Korea to observe the Korean general election or return to Success Lake has not yet been decided.

### Introducing Churchill's New Book

â€” Memoirs of the Second World War

[Our Correspondent in New York, 16th Dispatch] Winston Churchill, the wartime Prime Minister of Britain, has released his "Memoirs of the Second World War." It has been simultaneously published in the New York Times and Life Magazine starting from April 16th. In Britain, it is also being exclusively published by the Daily Telegraph from the same day.

Since the news of Churchill's dedicated writing of his memoirs spread, it has attracted great attention from the world. This is because Churchill bore the heavy responsibility for the safety of the British Empire during the Second World War. Naturally, he has the deepest knowledge of the formation, development, and various behind-the-scenes aspects of this war.

Furthermore, he has many retained confidential documents and diaries that can be utilized. Many historians believe that only two people are most qualified to chronicle this great war: President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill. With Roosevelt's unfortunate sudden death before the war ended, Churchill's memoirs will naturally become the most closely watched historical material of the Second World War.

This memoir is very long, divided into five volumes, with plans to publish one volume every half year. The first volume is titled "The Gathering Storm," which chronicles events from 1919 to 1939. It is further divided into two parts, the first part is "From War to War," and the second part is "The Twilight War." Each part is further divided into sections. The New York Times's publication on April 16th was the first section of the first part of the first volume, titled "The Follies of the Victors."

Before the first section, Churchill himself wrote a short preface, saying that this memoir can be seen as a continuation of his previous book about the First World War. If the two are read together, it can be said to be a chronicle of another "Thirty Years' War." He humbly said that what he wrote is not history because history should be left for the next generation to write; however, he firmly believes that these memoirs can make a considerable contribution to modern history for future use.

In the last paragraph of the preface, Churchill mentioned that one day, Roosevelt said that he was consulting on what name to give this great war. He (Churchill) immediately replied: It should be called "The Unnecessary War." Because this war, which shattered the essence of humanity, could have been avoided. In this long war, we sacrificed millions of precious lives. Justice has finally triumphed, "but peace and security have not been achieved and are in worse danger than what we overcame in the past." Therefore, he hopes that the lessons of the past described in these memoirs can become a guide for future generations so that the next generation will not repeat the mistakes of the past.

The content of the first section of the main text, "The Follies of the Victors," begins with the situation at the end of the First World War, including the conditions in France after the war, the Rhineland issue, the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the lack of importance attached to the issue of compensation, Clemenceau's downfall, the United States' non-participation in the League of Nations and the growth of isolationism, the Anglo-American naval disarmament, and the failure of the victorious countries to prevent Germany from rearming, and so on. Churchill expressed deep regret for the victorious countries' excessive leniency and slow actions after the First World War, which allowed German militarism to revive in the cracks.

This first section is already quite long, occupying an entire page. The second section published on April 17th is about the Locarno Pact, the economic crisis of 1929, and his relationship with Conservative Party leader Baldwin, and so on. The New York Times publishes one section daily, except on Sundays. The first volume may be serialized in this way for five weeks before it is completed.

### The Yang Jingzhou Disappearance Case: The Taiwan Police Department is Thoroughly Investigating; The Key is Whether His Ticket Was Seized When Boarding

[Our Dispatch from Taipei, 23rd] The Taiwan Provincial Security Authorities have not yet received a report on the Yang Jingzhou disappearance case. However, Deputy Director Lu of the Provincial Police Department and Chief Chen of the Criminal Affairs Department are conducting a thorough investigation. The first step in the investigation is whether Yang Jingzhou's ticket was seized when he boarded the ship on the 10th. According to the Keelung Port Authority, he did board the ship safely, but whether his ticket was seized needs to be investigated. The Port Authority stated that they had heard that Yang had considerable debts in Shanghai. The Police Department has decided to conduct an on-site inspection of the ship after the arrival of the People's Ferry on the 25th. Furthermore, according to Xingtai Company, Yang arrived in Taiwan on the 5th and stayed at the company's candy factory on Roosevelt Road. On the 6th, he lost the company's certificate for applying for an exit permit. On the night of the 7th, he suddenly claimed to be ill and asked a factory employee to accompany him to Guji Hospital for treatment. However, according to the doctor's diagnosis, there were no symptoms. He was prescribed a sedative solution, which he did not take. Based on this, it seems that he was mentally disturbed. He left the factory on the morning of the 9th and did not return all night. On the morning of the 10th, he returned to the factory, had breakfast, and went out, presumably to Keelung. On the 13th, a telegram was received from Shanghai, informing them of his disappearance. On the 16th, a missing person advertisement was published. Yang's father-in-law came on the 28th to inquire but found no clues and expressed his wish to the company to assist in the aftermath. The clues in this case seem to depend entirely on whether his ticket was seized. The Taiwan Police Department also hopes to learn about Yang's life.

### Bank Employee Sells Gold; Police Division Captures Suspect Through Disguised Entrapment Based on Tip

The Songhu Garrison Command's Economic Section cracked down on a group of people involved in the black market trading of gold yesterday. All of the suspects have been arrested and, after interrogation, will be transferred to the District Court for trial within days. The section received a tip a few days ago that Wang Xinbao, an employee of a certain bank in the city, was engaged in the black market trading of gold. Chen Mo, the head of the Economic Section, immediately sent personnel to investigate. However, because his trading activities were secretive, it was difficult to get started. After consulting with a certain organization, they decided to set up a room in the Yangtze Hotel to entice him to buy gold. At 11:00 AM on the 22nd of this month, members of the section negotiated the purchase of nine large bars of gold, priced at 395 million yuan per bar, totaling 3,545 million yuan, to be delivered at the Dekang Foreign Firm at 190 Jiujiang Road. Wang Xinbao immediately led a person named Zhu Delin, carrying nine large bars of gold, to deliver the goods. Director Chen had made arrangements and personally led five officers to follow them. When they were delivering the goods, they were immediately arrested. Zhu was taken to Xinbao's residence and confronted with him. After he confessed without hesitation, both the person and the goods were brought to the department for interrogation.

### Short-Term Treasury Bill Sales: The Key Lies in Interest Rates [Our Report]

The issuance of short-term treasury bills is imminent, and the National Bank authorities have high expectations for this. However, according to observations from financial circles, the interest rate on short-term treasury bills is still lower than the market interest rate. At a time of volatile prices, it may not be effective in absorbing idle funds. It is recalled that the sales of US dollar treasury bills, denominated in US dollars, were not greatly affected by commodity prices, yet their sales were not as ideal as expected. Therefore, excessive expectations should not be placed on the role of short-term treasury bills. In the future, most of the issued treasury bills, except for a portion listed as securities, will likely still be underwritten by Shanxi silver firms and money houses. As of now, the amount to be underwritten has not yet been decided.

National Goods Export Stagnation: Shanghai Tin Cloth Factories Partially Suspend Night Shifts

According to Mr. Wang Xingyao, a prominent figure in the national goods industry in this city, the recent export of cotton cloth has been temporarily impossible due to the impact of the shrinking Hong Kong exchange rate and low overseas market prices. Customers who placed orders in Shanghai have not yet submitted them. Domestically, due to sluggish actual sales, many cloth factories in the Wuxi area have suspended night shifts. Even smaller cotton weaving factories within this city have mostly suspended night shifts. Currently, in the national goods industry, not only is cotton cloth difficult to export, but also general merchandise. It can be said that everything is in a state of stagnation.

Ample Market Chips: Cotton Yarn Market Weakens Further

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was characterized by ample chips due to the previous day's distribution of yarn from the China Textile Construction Corporation. Customer sales remained sluggish, and the local market was also stagnant. Appetite among traders was weak, and the market trend weakened further. 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened and immediately fell below the 230 million mark, dropping to 227 million yuan at closing, a further drop of 3 million yuan compared to the previous day. Sai Guang and Shui Yue also continued to fall slightly by 2-3 million yuan. 21-count Double Horse yarn opened in the morning with offers to sell at 148 million yuan. Although there was some boosting from retail investors and trading desks, it briefly touched the 150 million mark. However, due to oversupply, it lacked the strength to rise and closed near 147 million yuan, a further decrease of 5 million yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarn generally fell by 5-6 million to 4-5 million yuan each.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw a downward trend as the China Textile Construction Corporation was distributing cloth again, and private dyeing factories also offered a large supply. Customer sales channels were narrow, and those who had hoarded goods mostly sold them off, causing the market to decline. 12-yard Dragon Head fine cloth opened with offers at 4.9 million yuan. Due to oversupply, it declined all the way to 4.86 million yuan at closing, a further decrease of 50,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Fine cloths such as Color Ball and Five Blessings also fell by 40-70,000 yuan. Markets for other products such as serge, bleached cloth, grey cloth, and domestic cloth also softened.

It is also reported that purchase orders for Five Blessings fine cloth supplied by the China Textile Construction Corporation were being sold at a discount of 30,000 yuan, and someone was willing to sell Dragon Head fine cloth for 4.85 million yuan.

China Textile Construction Yarn Sales [Our Report]

The China Textile Construction Corporation opened sales of cotton yarn yesterday (the 23rd) as usual, with 14 varieties available. A total of 240 applications were received, and 622 pieces of cotton yarn were sold, equivalent to 1018 pieces of 20-count yarn.

The assessed prices for each yarn were as follows: 20-count Jin Bao Xing 125 million yuan, 10-count Deputy Blue Phoenix 74 million yuan, 10-count Li Ma 74 million yuan, 16-count Red Moon 99 million yuan, 20-count Immortal Peach Grade 2 124 million yuan, 32-count Immortal Peach 164 million yuan, 32-count Double Strand Immortal Peach 173 million yuan, 32-count Double Strand Abundant Harvest 179 million yuan, 40-count Sunlight 178 million yuan, 40-count TK Color Ball 212 million yuan, 60-count Sunlight 228 million yuan, 60-count Double Strand Sunlight Mercerized 298 million yuan, 100-count Double Strand Sunlight Mercerized 1.3 billion yuan.

Spot Cotton Weakens

Yesterday's spot cotton market saw sluggish sales of cotton yarn, causing prices to decline. Sentiment was weak, and sellers were eager to unload their goods, causing offers to fall. Buyers were unwilling to purchase, and offers were even lower, leading to a fluctuating trend and mediocre trading. 400 bales were traded. Haiti premium cotton for public warehouse delivery was offered at 18.7 million yuan, Jingyang at 25 million yuan, Laohekou at 22.1 million yuan, Huoji at 18.4 million yuan, and Zhoupu seed cotton at 4.7 million yuan.

Xuanwei Sells Well

Sales of Xuanwei woolen cloth have been quite brisk recently, with local customers showing significant demand. In terms of color, light colors are the most popular. The selling price is lower compared to other woolen serge, mainly due to the impact of smuggled goods from the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. Each time a steamboat arrives in Shanghai from Hankou, it brings a considerable amount of goods, with three-quarters being Xuanwei woolen cloth, leading to a daily decline in market prices and creating an oversupply. Yesterday, Xuanwei woolen cloth brought from Hankou to Shanghai was offered at 4 million yuan per yard, while the China Textile brand sold for 3.75 million yuan, Jardine Matheson and Xie Xin sold for 4.3-4.4 million yuan, American goods for 4.6-4.7 million yuan, and British goods for 5.7-5.8 million yuan.

Narrow Fluctuations in Chinese Stocks: Slight Rebound Near Closing

Yesterday, securities firms were eager to buy Chinese stocks, but major investors, such as Mr. Long, were still selling. The market was stable at first but then weakened in the morning. Huaxin was the only stock to close at the daily limit. The burden eased in the afternoon, and banks made purchases, leading to a slight recovery near closing.

Initially, due to currency system concerns, sentiment was slightly apprehensive. Yongsha opened at a high price of 1,950 yuan, but after the exchange rate did not change, it fell to a low price of 1,890 yuan.

Compared with the previous close, only Huaxin rose by half a percent, Zhongfa Yongye showed a small increase, Datong Guohuo Xinhua was flat, and the rest showed slight declines.

In the afternoon market, Yongsha opened at 1,935 yuan, but it was only for a two-day handling fee. It was initially bought up to 1,940 yuan, but was later sold down to 1,909 yuan. There was little intervention from the National Bank, and banks also made some purchases. Rumors about the exchange rate started again, and the price was pushed up to 1,980 yuan near closing, closing at 1,975 yuan. Compared with the morning close, all stocks showed a slight increase. The gains and losses of unlisted stocks outside the market were still minimal.

Government bonds were stable yesterday, with a turnover of approximately 4 million. Unified Class C bonds opened in the morning at 100,400 and rose from 100,300 to close at 100,800, a slight increase of 1,000 yuan compared with the previous close.

Foreign stocks also showed weakness, with limited trading. Securities firms absorbed Yisha, while foreign firms sold Asia, and Hong Kong Electric was flat and stable.

Part of the Students at Fudan University Boycott Classes: Protesting the Search: Wu Mayor Thoroughly Investigates, No Police Department Personnel Sent to Search the School [Our Report]

More than 500 students from some departments of National Fudan University (out of a total of more than 3,000 students) announced a class boycott yesterday to protest the illegal search by unidentified persons the day before, and decided to continue the class boycott for another day today. The remaining 2,500 students continued to attend class as usual yesterday and today. The incident occurred because about 20 students from the school held a work review meeting for the Music Festival concert in the Hanyuan Tea House on Guoquan Road near the school at about 1:00 PM on the 21st. Three unidentified persons came forward to search the meeting host, Yang Guichang (a second-year student in the Department of Journalism), and seized two copies of the meeting minutes and three personal letters from Yang. This aroused the anger of the students, and yesterday they announced a class boycott in the name of each department, and continued the class boycott for another day to show their protest. The school has telegraphed Principal Zhang Yi, who is attending the National Assembly in Beijing, urging him to return to the school immediately to deal with the matter.

It is learned that He Dehe, the Dean of Students of the school, received a phone call from Mayor Wu yesterday, explaining two points: (1) He has ordered an investigation of all police stations, and no police department personnel have been sent to the school to search students; (2) Although Guoquan Road is close to the school, it is not within the school campus.

### Severe Recession in the Cigarette Industry: Two-Thirds of Factories Shut Down

[Report from this Newspaper] According to industrial sources, the cigarette industry in this city is in a deep crisis. To date, the number of cigarette factories that have partially or completely ceased operations has reached two-thirds of the total. Last month, the city's cigarette production was 120,000 cases, while in the first half of this month, production was only 30,000 cases. According to industry insiders, there are two reasons for the crisis: First, the citizens' purchasing power is weak, while cigarette prices are high, leading to sluggish sales. Second, the tax burden is too heavy. Currently, the tax rate for goods is 100% of the price. Before March, the tax price was adjusted every three months, but now it has been changed to monthly adjustments, thus increasing the burden.

### Textile Industry Moves to Hong Kong to Establish Factories: Some Have Already Started Operations; Estimated Total Number of Spindles is Approximately 300,000

According to authoritative sources in the financial industry, as of now, more than a dozen Shanghai yarn magnates have established yarn factories in Hong Kong. The estimated total number of spindles could reach 300,000. More than 1,000 spindles have already been installed and put into operation. Several thousand more spindles are being installed. It is expected that more than 10,000 spindles will be in operation by the end of next month. Based on current production costs and market prices in Hong Kong, each bale of cotton yarn can earn approximately HK$500, and there are no import and export restrictions. All foreign exchange earnings can be freely used. However, according to observations from relevant parties, once the domestic economic situation improves and prices stabilize, yarn factories relocated to Hong Kong may find it difficult to compete with domestic yarn factories. The reason is that the Hong Kong government has strict regulations on factory management and worker welfare. For example, female workers cannot work night shifts, child labor cannot replace adult workers, and there are clear regulations on workers' wages, food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Furthermore, in addition to Indian cotton, only American cotton can be ordered as raw materials. At the same time, due to the local climate, factory equipment is susceptible to humidity, and the installation costs are also higher. Therefore, all costs are higher than in the mainland. But at present, it is indeed an opportunity to make a profit, but the impact on the national socio-economy is not small.

### Minor Fluctuations in Market Prices: Rice Prices Tend to Waver; Active Sales in the Oil Market, Turning from Sluggish to High

Yesterday, rice prices in the north and south markets fluctuated, but the changes were small, and the trend remained wavering. When the south market opened in the morning, prices were lowered again due to the decline in Wuxi prices and the difficulty for sellers to sell. The morning market once fell by 100,000 yuan. Later, after learning that prices in the north market were rising, the decline stopped and prices became firm. As a result, high-quality white japonica rice fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, medium and lower-quality rice fell by 50,000 yuan, and thin indica rice rose by 50,000 yuan. Merchants in the north market took advantage of the low prices and absorbed supplies, raising prices by 50,000 yuan. The total arrivals in the two markets were 3,552 shi.

Flour continued to decline, and retailers frequently sold off their stocks, as it was rumored that the Civil Food Allocation Committee would resume the allocation of flour, resulting in ample supply and little demand. Military ship flour opened at 1.34 million yuan, the lowest was 1.33 million yuan, and closed at 1.355 million yuan, a decrease of 25,000 yuan. Lao Che flour was the same price as military ship flour. Red Bee flour fell to 1.3 million yuan, wheat bran fell again by 5,000 yuan, and wheat factory prices fell below the 2 million yuan mark to 1.98 million yuan.

The prices of miscellaneous grains fluctuated. Yellow beans were patronized by buyers, and sales were slightly active, rising by 50,000 yuan. The supply and demand of corn were equal, and the market was stable. Mung beans had stopped selling to buyers and fell sharply by 200,000 yuan. Red beans also fell, while selected green beans for local sales remained stable and prices leveled off. Sesame was similar to the previous day, and peanut kernels were bought by Cantonese merchants, with Qinhuangdao peanut kernels jumping by 600,000 yuan.

Cooking oil prices rose, and buyers took advantage of the low prices, leading to active sales. Soybean oil rebounded, rising from 8.45 million yuan to 8.58 million yuan, an increase of approximately 180,000 yuan. Raw oil rose by 250,000 yuan, with raw oil in drums rising to 9.8 million yuan. Raw sesame oil increased by 200,000 yuan, and there were very few transactions for raw vegetable oil. Small-scale sesame oil rose slightly by 50,000 yuan.

### Active Sales in the Tea Market

Although sales of domestic tea to Tianjin merchants were sluggish, there was still continuous demand from local merchants and from Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places, leading to active sales. In terms of prices, various types of aged tea remained firm in the face of scarce supply and demand. As for this year's new tea, prices have been hovering near the source due to the continuous arrival of supplies, but the foundation is not solid. As for the foreign tea market, sales have gradually become quiet. American sales are stagnant, and North Africa, a French territory, also has sufficient supply, causing buyers not to purchase. However, sellers' minds remain resilient, and the market can stand firm.

### Kerosene Prices Fall Due to Ample Supply

In the kerosene market, Mobile and Asia Petroleum and other companies have distributed large quantities of kerosene in barrels, with an allocation price of only 1,000 yuan per barrel. As a result, there is more capital in the market, and most transactions are done by dealers breaking bulk. High-grade barrel oil was traded at 15.5 million to 16 million yuan, while kerosene in cans was only traded at 1.8 million yuan. Sellers are loosening their grip, and the market is weakening.
