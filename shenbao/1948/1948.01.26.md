### US Submits Plan to Far Eastern Commission to Support Japan's Reconstruction; We Have Received Note and are Studying It

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] A Foreign Ministry official stated on the 25th: The Ministry has recently received a lengthy note from the United States submitted to the Far Eastern Commission of Eleven Nations in Washington, D.C., outlining the necessity of supporting Japan's self-sufficiency and self-reliance, requesting the endorsement of all Allied nations, and jointly participating in this "grand undertaking." The official declined to disclose whether the note was accompanied by a concrete numerical plan, but acknowledged that the Ministry attached great importance to it and was carefully studying it. The results of the study will be submitted to higher authorities for approval, and only after a final decision by the highest national policy-making body will instructions be given to our officials on the Far Eastern Commission to express our country's attitude. It is reported that since the news of the US War Department's request for US$500 million in aid to Japan reached this area, all parties have been paying close attention, and the official report has refrained from making any comments. The general view is that America's generosity towards Japan has exceeded what a victorious nation in World War II should extend to a nation still in a position of hostility, and that there is a tendency towards indulgence. In order to establish peace in the Far East, our country should urgently assert its position.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Deputy Foreign Minister Yeh Kung-chao, after confirming that we had received the US note regarding the plan to assist Japan's reconstruction, stated: This is a proposal made solely by the United States, and whether it can be established will depend on the Far Eastern Commission of Eleven Nations meeting to discuss and decide. As for our country's position, it will be stated after research and decision.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 25th] Li Jing-lu, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Communications, stated on the 25th: An agreement has been reached on our side opening up air transport routes between China and Japan. Our side is actively preparing, and the date of the inaugural flight has not yet been determined.

### Far Eastern Commission Stipulates Japanese Steel Production Levels

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] Steel experts here say that it is rumored that the Far Eastern Commission has stipulated that Japan's annual production of pig iron should be 2 million tons and steel ingots 250,000 tons. To reach the steel production level stipulated by the Far Eastern Commission, Japan must import a large amount of pig iron and scrap iron. The level stipulated by the Commission is far higher than what the Japanese steel industry generally hopes for. The expert recently told a Central News Agency reporter that the 10 million tons of raw materials to be imported in the future will include 4 million tons of iron ore, 2 million tons of coking coal, and 1 million tons of other important materials. In addition, Japan must import 250,000 tons of pig iron from abroad to manufacture the 3.25 million tons of steel ingots stipulated by the Far Eastern Commission. The expert cited reliable foreign sources as saying that after the peace treaty is concluded, Japan will be allowed to own 1.5 million tons of coastal transport ships. The expert also emphasized that Japan must also have a merchant fleet for import and export trade in the future.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 25th] An Indian official in charge of reparations materials told the Associated Press on the 24th that most of the factory equipment compensated by Japan could not be described as "superior." Mr. Raju, a technical advisor to the Indian government, also stated that some of the factory equipment shipped to other countries needs to be partially repaired before it can be used. He was referring to shipyards, steel plants, and heavy chemical plants.

### True Face of Communist Areas: Cruel Atrocities Horrifying

[Associated Press, Qingdao, 25th] A Chinese observer, known for his free and progressive thinking, recently returned from the Lu Province area newly recovered by the National Army and published his thoughts on the 25th, saying: "In the Communist areas, there is no rule of law, because the Communist Party believes that the law is designed to protect the rich. The atrocities of the 'Liberated Area' government are extremely brutal. The October Revolution in the Soviet Union killed millions of people, but it still cannot compare to the cruelty of the revolutionary government in the CCP-controlled areas. In the Communist areas, all those who are regarded by the Communist Party as 'national spies, reactionaries, anti-Communists, suspected reactionaries, and those who refuse to obey the policies of the Communist Party' are massacred or tortured on a large scale. The Communist Party seems to be paranoid about anything that does not conform to the CCP's movement, and they universally use shockingly inhumane corporal punishment to interrogate 'unruly' suspects." This observer witnessed dismembered and rotting corpses, the results of "class struggle" assassinations, the ruthless liquidation of anti-Communists. An old farmer tearfully recounted that his son was ordered to kill his father and was killed by him. The old farmer was old and unwilling to change his beliefs, and was considered reactionary and feudal. He refused to "repent," and his son, a progressive youth, was tasked with killing his father, otherwise he would be stoned to death by the people. The father and son jointly dug a grave for the old farmer. His son regarded killing him as a trivial matter. The old farmer was stunned, and in a moment of urgency, killed his son with a plow. This is the general situation after the "people's revolution" succeeded. "Of course people die in revolutions, but in the CCP areas, the death penalty seems endless." The people in the Communist areas all hate the Communist Party.

### Uranium Ore Discovery is Not Easy: Experiences of American Mining Expert

[Central News Agency, Washington, 24th, United Press] Matthew, a mining expert from the US Department of the Interior, said that traces of uranium ore, the material for making atomic bombs, are extremely scattered. He once picked up a piece inside Swarthmore College near Philadelphia. But he said that uranium ore is not like gold. If a gold nugget is found, there will definitely be more gold nearby, but the situation is different when a uranium nugget is found. Uranium ore may not be found even 100 miles away. Thousands of traces of uranium ore have been found on the East Coast, but there are no real deposits there. Someone with special equipment may find some ore deposits in the western United States. Most countries have been surveying for this metal in recent days, and rich uranium deposits have been found in the past few months. Apart from the western United States, reports have been made of discoveries in Burma and South Africa. He said that prospectors without surveying equipment must rely on their eyesight.

### Liaobei Recovers Dongfeng and Xifeng; Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat Unfolds in Xinlitun; Fan Hanjie's Troops Gradually Arriving Outside the Pass

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 25th] The battle of Xinlitun has reached a boiling point. Fierce hand-to-hand combat broke out between the two sides on the 24th, and the sound of gunfire continued throughout the night. The Communist bandits repeatedly attacked fiercely, suffering increasing casualties. Corpses of bandits were scattered around the station. As of dawn on the 25th, they were still fighting hard.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 25th] A part of Fan Hanjie's army corps has already landed in Huludao, and another part will land in Qinhuangdao on the 26th and 27th. Troops will also be increased in the Guannei section of the Beining Railway. Counties along the railway have been ordered to begin merging small villages into large villages in order to facilitate defense. In addition, the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters has slightly divided the defenses of Hebei. Shangguan Yunxiang commands the Jin-Yu section of the Beining Railway and the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, An Chunshan is responsible for the Pingjin Road and the Pingjin-Bao triangle area, and Song Kentang is responsible for the northern section of the Pinghan Railway.

The two strongholds of Heishan and Dahushan south of Xinlitun seem to have been occupied by the Communist army, which hinders the National Army's northbound reinforcements. At the same time, the National Army is preparing to clear the section of the railway from Shanhaiguan to Shenyang. The troops recently transported by sea from Shandong to Huludao will participate in this sweeping operation. Local newspapers report that about 20,000 Communist troops are gathering near Dagu. Both the British and American consulates in Changchun are preparing to close and evacuate. They have been supplied by air for several months, but now they are finding it increasingly difficult.

There is another column in southern Liaoning, and a force of one column is placed northeast of Shenyang. There are no large bandits entrenched around Jilin and Changchun. According to his judgment, the total strength of the Communist army in the vast area north of Siping to the Songhua River will not exceed 50,000 men. Regarding the rumors that the government will abandon Jilin and Changchun, Li called them "absolutely unfounded rumors." He said that the troops and equipment in the two places that are rumored to be abandoned are currently being strengthened.

### Sui Army Launches General Offensive; Bandit Remnants Flee Across the River from the Zhun Banner

### Mobilization Meeting in Cultural Circles; Explanation of the Significance of Suppressing the Rebellion

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] The General Mobilization Committee of Chinese Cultural Circles for Suppressing the Rebellion and Saving the Nation, in order to clarify the significance of suppressing the rebellion and ensure that the people have a correct understanding of it, so that they know where to direct their efforts, recently published an article entitled "Our Views on Suppressing the Rebellion," which is recorded as follows:

Today's suppression of the rebellion is to quell the Communist Party's revolt. To refer to it as a "civil war" or a "factional struggle" is a superficial view. To understand the suppression of the rebellion, we must pay attention to its historical context.

China's economy is backward and has stagnated in the era of monarchical autocracy for a long time. In addition, due to imperialist aggression, it is necessary to undergo a revolution to strive for national independence, implement democratic politics, and improve the people's livelihood. To achieve these goals, building a unified country is an urgent need. The National Revolution of the past fifty years has completely followed this path.

Under these circumstances, we can only talk about the Three Principles of the People, not communism. Even the Communist Party acknowledges this, so when it comes to revolution, the Communist Party itself believes that it cannot carry out a socialist revolution at present, but only a democratic revolution. Since this is the case, it is very clear that communism does not meet the needs of the times. If you insist on doing something that does not meet the needs of the times, it will inevitably fail. What achievements can be made other than creating chaos?

We know that the Communist Party has a preconceived notion that the Chinese Kuomintang is not democratic, and that only it can implement democracy, so it shouts loudly for a democratic revolution. This is due to its deliberate misinterpretation of political tutelage. In fact, the democratic revolution is entirely the cause that the Chinese Kuomintang has been striving for. The Xinhai Revolution, the campaign against Yuan Shikai, the Constitutional Protection Movement, and the Northern Expedition were all implementations of the democratic revolution. As for convening the National Assembly and enacting and implementing the constitution, they have made the democratic revolution a success. This not only shows that the Kuomintang is a democratic party, but also shows that the Communist Party's shouting for a democratic revolution is empty and impractical.

Since what the Communist Party is doing is not a democratic revolution, it is very clear that its armed occupation of territory is a rebellion, a simple rebellion. The so-called democratic revolution is just a smokescreen to cover up its rebellion. Then the war to suppress the Communist Party's rebellion is indeed a suppression of the rebellion. This is completely true not only from a legal and formal point of view, but also from a political and practical point of view.

Is suppressing the rebellion a civil war? No. The Communist Party is an international political party with an international background. Its actions are subject to international orders, and it has also united with international armies such as the Korean Communists and Japanese prisoners of war. Therefore, its rebellion has international significance. At the same time, the Communist Party is a tool for new imperialism to invade China, just as warlords were tools for old imperialism to invade China. It is a red fifth column. Does this not show that the Communist Party's rebellion is a form of new imperialism's invasion of China? Therefore, suppressing the rebellion is a forward battle against aggression and has the significance of saving the country.

Then, is suppressing the rebellion a revolution? It is very clear that today's Communist Party rebellion is taking place in the era of revolution, that is, between the early and late stages of the National Revolution. Therefore, it has the effect of destroying the success of the early revolution and hindering the progress of the later revolution. Suppressing the rebellion is enough to maintain the success of the early revolution and facilitate the progress of the later revolution. This is of course a revolution, and it is also very clear that the Communist Party's rebellion is reactionary.

The Chinese Communist Party is a separatist force. It has been armed and occupying territory for twenty years. The purpose of suppressing the rebellion is to break the separatist regime and achieve unification. Unification is a political movement from feudalism to modernity, which can modernize the country. Therefore, unification is a revolution. Since suppressing the rebellion is for unification, it also has a revolutionary effect.

Suppressing the rebellion is not only for unification, but also for democracy. It must be known that the Communist Party's loud cry for democracy is purely a means. It is not a democratic party, and its doctrine is the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the so-called "liberated areas," what is implemented is violent rule, terror rule, and secret service rule. Recently, it has openly opposed the constitution. It must be known that the constitution is the codification and legalization of democracy, and it is a necessary method to make democracy a system. To implement democracy today, we must support the constitution. Suppressing the rebellion is to protect the constitution, and it is actually a democratic war, that is, a war between democracy and dictatorship.

In addition to its livelihood nature, suppressing the rebellion also has a nation-building nature. The Communist Party is a destructive force, specializing in tearing up roads, destroying mines, digging dikes, destroying factories, killing people, and arson, which is a hundred times worse than Japanese imperialism. If China wants to resist the threat of new imperialist aggression and improve the people's livelihood, it must also work hard to build. Therefore, we have the necessity of opposing destruction. Therefore, suppressing the rebellion is a struggle between construction and destruction.

The above explains the relationship between suppressing the rebellion and saving the country, unification, democracy, and nation-building, and these four are all requirements of the National Revolution. Suppressing the rebellion, in its nature as a war to save the country, a war to unify, a war for democracy, and a war to build the nation, is indeed a revolutionary war. Saving the country, unification, democracy, and nation-building are all practices of the Three Principles of the People, so suppressing the rebellion is a revolutionary war to strive for the Three Principles of the People, which is very important. Therefore, it cannot be denigrated as a civil war, nor can it be regarded as a factional struggle. May I ask, is saving the country, unification, democracy, and nation-building just a matter for the party and have nothing to do with the people and the country? Therefore, the people of the whole country should be mobilized unanimously, contribute money and effort, and actively participate. This is the revolutionary work at the current stage. If China is to be saved and built into a new China of democracy, unification, and the Three Principles of the People, only suppressing the rebellion can do it. This is China's way out and new life, and we should make every effort to complete it as soon as possible. For the sake of doctrine, for the sake of revolution, for the sake of the country, and for the sake of the people, we must start from this.

### A New Cooperation in Sino-American Journalism – Reflections on the Translation and Publication of "The Memoirs of Cordell Hull" by This Newspaper

This newspaper will begin publishing "The Memoirs of Cordell Hull" on a daily basis starting today. There is no need to say that this memoir will be an important document of World War II, but its importance is not limited to this. World War II was the most devastating catastrophe in human history. As a result of this war, humans were prompted to use atomic energy. The Hiroshima bomb was not only the prelude to ending this catastrophe, but also ushered humanity into a new atomic age. Its importance in the entire history of mankind is comparable to the initial use of fire, the invention of planting, and the use of steam power. This war has marked a new era in the history of human culture. Whether this new era will bring destruction or prosperity to mankind remains to be proven by future facts, but it is undeniable that this war has brought mankind into a new era. The reason why mankind had this war was not due to the attack on Pearl Harbor, the invasion of Poland and Czechoslovakia, or the "incident" at Lugou Bridge. These superficial actions contained deeper conflicts. Before these actions were taken, there was a development of internal conflicts. The taking of these actions was merely the highest development of internal conflicts. In this sense, we see Prussian military strategists regarding war as the highest means of carrying out national policy. Therefore, modern warfare is the result of the accumulation of national policy conflicts. World War II had its historical background and was by no means an accidental event. Since World War II has opened up a new era for mankind, the outbreak of this war is an important key in human history. This key is not entirely in the hands of those who wield military power, but also in the hands of the diplomatic authorities who are responsible for negotiating and coordinating. It is feared that those who decide and implement foreign policy are the main writers of new pages in human history. One of the most important of these is undoubtedly Secretary of State Cordell Hull under President Roosevelt. He was appointed to his post at a time when the country was threatened by economic panic and when the great powers were only seeking immediate gains and isolation without assistance. By the end of his tenure, we saw the attack on Pearl Harbor, which triggered World War II. Hull is a historical figure. What he has written down is not only the history of the United States, but also the history of the world and the history of all mankind. Because of this, we feel extremely honored and delighted to have the opportunity today to translate and publish this new work, "The Memoirs of Cordell Hull," as soon as possible and to share it with the millions of readers in China.

What we want to point out here is that the publication of this memoir in this newspaper represents a new page in the history of Chinese journalism and even in the history of Sino-American relations. Chinese newspapers have always made as much use of foreign news agency manuscripts as possible. However, due to the continuous development of the news industry, in addition to news agencies providing news, there has also been the development of special news manuscript supply agencies, which are particularly developed in the United States. In the United States, there are various organizations of special news manuscript supply agencies that supply newspapers across the country with essays, monographs, and other special articles. The "syndicated features" are written by one person, and newspapers compete to purchase the copyright to publish them, so that they can reach a large number of readers. This development has been very effective in the United Kingdom and the United States, but in China, it still needs to be worked hard. As for establishing a relationship with American syndicated news manuscript supply agencies, the publication of "The Memoirs of Cordell Hull" by this newspaper is the first in China. This has to be said to be a new era in the history of the Chinese newspaper industry. We hope that in the future, the press circles of China and the United States will be able to have continuous and closer development.

Undoubtedly, the communication between people is an element that promotes international understanding. A key to this is the free flow of factual information and beneficial reading materials. In totalitarian countries, there is strict news censorship, and deep mutual understanding is almost impossible. Or even relying on narrow nationalism to maliciously exclude foreign manuscripts. All of these are contrary to the principle of free flow of news and information and violate the spirit of democratic politics. This newspaper's publication of "The Memoirs of Cordell Hull" supplied by the American Editors Press News Agency, which has obtained the copyright in various languages, including the original English copyright, in Shanghai, not only shows that this newspaper, although the oldest newspaper in Chinese history, is still a newspaper that seeks progress every day and is always new, but also shows the full freedom that the news industry in China can enjoy, reflecting the Chinese government's enlightened policy of absolute respect for freedom of the press and non-interference in the news industry.

Here, we must point out that all malicious rumors against the Chinese government are mostly fabricated by the Communist bandits. The purpose is very obvious. There are occasional reports in foreign newspapers about how the Chinese government controls public opinion and other malicious slanders. If they are published without scrutiny, they will do obligatory propaganda for the Communist bandits. It must be known that the Chinese government never wants to restrict the legitimate freedom of the people. The fact that this newspaper publishes manuscripts supplied by the American Editors Press News Agency can provide factual proof. We hope to have closer ties with our American counterparts so that we can fulfill our journalistic duty of free reporting and increase mutual understanding between China and the United States. When we say mutual understanding, we also hope that our American counterparts can have more contact with the press circles that can represent China, so that the truth about China can be faithfully reported to the United States, and the American people's understanding of China can also be increased accordingly. Cultivating friendship with neighbors and maintaining world peace may begin with these things!

### 法政府正式通知英美　決實施法郎貶值　貶值令決延至今日宣布

[United Press, Paris, 25th] The French government delayed the formal announcement of the franc devaluation by 24 hours on the 25th. It is believed that the government had previously announced that it would proceed with its devaluation plan regardless of British opposition and the ambiguous attitude of the International Monetary Fund. However, Schumann's spokesman announced on the evening of the 24th that the devaluation order would be delayed for another 24 hours.

[Reuters, Paris, 24th] French Finance Minister Mayer declared that the government's franc devaluation plan is expected to be formally announced on Sunday afternoon, and a joint communiqué on Anglo-French talks on the franc issue may also be released at the same time.

[Reuters, Paris, 24th] The French cabinet today passed a bill stipulating regulations for the management of foreign exchange and gold markets, and scheduled it for review by the National Assembly on Monday. A government spokesman said that the International Monetary Fund has not yet made a decision on the French system. The government's franc devaluation plan will be announced simultaneously with the International Monetary Fund's decision.

[Reuters, Washington, 24th] The Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund continued to discuss the franc devaluation issue today. A spokesperson stated that there is no certainty whether the Fund can issue a formal statement within days. French officials have indicated that if the Fund does not adopt the franc devaluation plan, France will not hesitate to withdraw from the Fund. It is generally expected that the Fund's statement will emphasize the temporary nature of France's franc devaluation and express hope that France will soon have a more normal exchange rate system to replace the actions currently being taken.

[United Press, Paris, 24th] According to reliable sources: The French government has notified Washington and London today that, regardless of opposition from all parties, the export franc will be devalued starting on the evening of the 25th. France insists that this action is an important step to end the French economic crisis. It is reported that France has taken this action while British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps is here, having nearly 24 hours of debate, trying to persuade France to abandon this plan, and has boarded a plane to return to England. Cripps argued that any reduction in the value of the franc would inevitably lead to a devaluation of the pound sterling. He also insisted that the devaluation of the franc would endanger the new Western European alliance under the leadership of Britain and France, as proposed by British Foreign Secretary Bevin on the 22nd. The French cabinet is awaiting the opinion of the International Monetary Fund in Washington on the franc's decision. However, France appears to have already decided on how to proceed with this matter. In notes to London and Washington, France declared that the exchange rate of the export franc to the US dollar is 225 to 1. The current exchange rate between the franc and the dollar is 119 to 1. It is learned that there are two other programs in the French monetary stabilization plan: the establishment of a gold and foreign currency trading market in Paris, which will be submitted to the National Assembly on the 26th. The French cabinet has authorized open gold trading, but has been unable to decide on the franc devaluation for some time due to strong opposition from Britain. The French cabinet is seeking ways to resolve the economic turmoil in a two-hour emergency meeting. According to the new plan, legal entities holding foreign currency can sell foreign currency in France at open market prices. French Minister-Delegate Auberlin has hinted at a compromise agreement between Britain and France on the devaluation issue. Informed sources in London diplomatic circles say that even if the franc is devalued, it will not lead to a devaluation of the pound sterling. It is claimed that there are many loopholes in the French plan, through which speculators can buy pounds sterling at prices lower than the official rate, which "although not a major issue, will cause our anger."

### 法郎貶值計劃實行後　英鎊價值難維持　英人士認爲原計劃漏洞甚多

[United Press, London, 25th] British Foreign Office sources said on the 25th that France's franc devaluation plan will make it difficult to maintain the current value of the British pound, but France's actions will not trigger a devaluation of the pound. Sources close to the Treasury Department said: "This matter is quite annoying, but not a fatal blow." Britain is extremely concerned about France's plan to devalue the export franc and establish a free export market. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Cripps traveled to Paris with Treasury Secretary Sir Eady and Deputy Governor of the Bank of England Cobbold, which shows the importance Britain attaches to this matter.

Eady and Cobbold jointly traveled to the United States in August last year when Britain decided to suspend the free convertibility of the pound. Informed sources said: France's plan will create more loopholes, through which speculators can buy pounds sterling at a price lower than the official rate of four shillings and three pence. If so, it will be more difficult for the government to maintain the price, but this is not enough to cause a devaluation of the pound. The Financial Times said that the French plan will create "a gambler's paradise."

### 美政府下令　增加銀行準備金

[United Press, Washington, 24th] The government has recently passed a measure to curb inflation in the banking system, which is a simple explanation of the new regulations of the Federal Reserve by government economists. According to the new regulations, banks under the control of Chicago and New York must increase their reserves from 20% to 22%. The new regulations will take effect on February 27. This regulation is not as drastic as directly controlling prices and rationing, but it is sufficient to freeze $100 million in Chicago and $420 million in New York. Currently, the total amount of reserves required by these banks is $4.3 billion in New York and $1 billion in Chicago. It is reported that most of the banking community supports the new regulations.

### 促進歐洲團結謀取世界和科　本年九月將有兩大集會

[Reuters, Geneva, 25th] Europe will hold two major conferences in September this year to seek world peace through a federal system. One is a conference to be held in Italy in early September, with the goal of establishing a world federal government. The other is the European Parliamentary Union, which will hold a meeting in Switzerland on September 8 to discuss the organization of the United States of Europe. The headquarters of the World Federal Government Movement is located in Geneva, and more than 50 organizations from 20 countries with the goal of establishing a world federal government have joined this international organization. Regarding the establishment of the United States of Europe, the Executive Committee of the European Parliamentary Union passed its outline at a meeting in Switzerland in December last year. The Executive Committee decided to convene a general meeting in Interlaken, Switzerland on September 8 this year to draft the constitution of the United States of Europe. Members of parliament from all European countries can send representatives to participate. It is expected that 13 countries, including Britain and France, will participate. It is said that the majority of members of parliament in Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg support the organization of the United States of Europe.

### 烏克蘭建國紀念　蘇外長致辭

[Reuters, London, 24th] Moscow Radio said: Foreign Minister Molotov personally addressed the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine on the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic, saying that the great October Revolution had liberated the people of all Russia from the slavery of capitalism, indicating to the world the path of communism, introducing a free and happy life and a path of friendship between nations. The 30-year process of the founding of the Ukrainian Republic is full of struggles for economic and cultural revival. During the war, Ukraine was occupied by the German imperialist army, and there were bourgeois elements in Ukraine who were willing to be driven by it. At the beginning of the founding of the Soviet Union, the attempts of Britain and France to intervene in Ukraine with military force were also well-known facts. However, with the help of the Soviet Union, the land of Ukraine was finally unified, and the population of Ukraine is now almost equal to that of any of the largest countries in Europe. Today, we are here to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of Ukraine, which is of great significance in terms of time for the people of Ukraine and the entire Soviet Union.

### 捷克破獲間諜機關

[United Press, Prague, 25th] A formal communiqué on the 25th stated that a total of fifteen civilians, soldiers, and women have been arrested on charges of "conducting espionage activities for a certain Western power." The communiqué stated that these spies are mostly Sudeten Germans, who maintain contact with repatriated German family members and friends. They were suspected of providing a certain Sudeten German spy organization, established by a certain Western power, with information about the Czech army and factories "of military importance." The communiqué stated that the group is mainly composed of former secret police, Nazi SS, and other similar criminals.

### 外長代表將開會　　討論奧境德資產

[Reuters, London, 25th] The special representatives of the four foreign ministers are scheduled to meet this week to discuss the Soviet proposals on German assets in Austria and the French compromise proposals. A British Foreign Office spokesman said that the secretariat of the Foreign Ministers' Conference has received the full text of the recent Soviet proposals, and some points are clearer than before.

### The Western European Union Plan Actively Unfolds: Britain Seeks Diplomatic Initiative; McNeil Expresses Continued Willingness to Reconcile with the Soviet Union

[Reuters, London, 24th] Foreign Secretary Bevin's announcement of the launch of the Western European Union plan, and the simultaneous declaration by the French government, have broken the diplomatic silence following the failure of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is now known that with the apparent support of the United States, Britain and France have launched a new policy in the West, seizing the diplomatic initiative from the countries east of the Elbe River. Regarding Britain, the actions to be implemented following the adoption of the new policy are as follows: Unite Western European countries and their overseas territories to develop the Western European Union; Constitutional reforms in West Germany, possibly merging the three occupation zones of Britain, the United States, and France, and establishing an international regime for the Ruhr; Britain completes a network of treaties with Arab countries to establish a regional security system in the Middle East; Continue cooperation with countries participating in the Marshall Plan.

The general objective of Bevin's policy is to engage in cooperation with countries that are politically sympathetic to Britain.

[Reuters, Gateshead, Durham County, 24th] Minister of State McNeil delivered a speech at a Labour Party meeting here, reiterating Britain's willingness to talk and use all diplomatic procedures to seek better relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and to discuss any issues between them. "This is our country's policy, and we will never abandon it. We will continue to play an active role in the United Nations organization, accept the obligations incumbent upon member states, and are always willing to use the various agencies of the United Nations. I would like to reiterate that we will never abandon this policy." Labour left-wing Member of Parliament Zilliacus, elected from the Gateshead constituency, then spoke, saying, "Churchill once said that the Labour government has adopted his speech delivered in Fulton, USA, which is indeed the case. Churchill's Fulton speech advocated the establishment of an Anglo-American Western alliance and used war as a threat against the Soviet Union." Watson, a leader of the Durham miners, stated that 90% of those attending the meeting were strong supporters of the government.

United Nations Watchful

[United Press, Lake Success, 24th] Regarding the increasing development of the Western European Union plan, the United Nations stated on the evening of the 24th that it marked the end of the "One World" concept of international relations. This is the United Nations' sharpest response to Bevin's call to establish a Western European bloc to counter the Soviet Union. United Nations diplomats have widely divergent opinions on who is to blame for this plan and what the final outcome of the Western European bloc plan will be. However, there seems to be unanimous agreement that the United Nations is currently facing a serious test, and some even express doubts about the survival of the United Nations organization. A senior representative of China, who is among the most supportive of Western powers in the United Nations, also stated that the Western bloc plan is incompatible with the concept of "One World." United Nations officials are now watching how the Soviet Union and Western countries are abandoning the United Nations Charter, the Soviet Union's boycott of the United Nations' main and related organizations, the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan's actions bypassing the United Nations, the tactics of using the Security Council and the General Assembly to exert pressure on each other between East and West, and the gradual hardening of the Eastern and Western blocs within the United Nations organization, which are said to be preventing the United Nations from achieving its goals. It is said that the Nordic countries and Asian countries (such as India) also seem to be gradually joining the Western camp, and although the Arab countries are extremely indignant at the United States' partition plan for Palestine, they will still join the Western camp.

Moscow's Reaction

[United Press, Moscow, 24th] TASS News Agency announced on the 24th that British Foreign Secretary Bevin's proposal to strengthen Western Europe is a "smokescreen" for the establishment of a Western European bloc. In reality, the Western European bloc has already been formed, and the simultaneous establishment of political, economic, and military alliances is an undeniable fact. Britain's willingness to conclude defense treaties with Iran, Iraq, Egypt, and other Arab countries also reveals the shadow of the Eastern bloc, which is obvious to anyone with intelligence. The United Kingdom and the United States want to use a chain of treaties to bind the Arab countries. Washington and London are now developing a military-political joint program, attempting to use all bases in the Middle East for their armed forces. The Soviet Union has always opposed the establishment of any Western European bloc, considering it detrimental to its own interests. Therefore, its opposition to Bevin's plan will almost certainly be the same as its efforts against the Marshall Plan. According to Radio Moscow commentator Inevsky, Bevin is now a tool of American imperialists' European plan and has clearly taken a step forward in this true mission. It is no coincidence that the United States had a demand for a Western European alliance before Bevin publicly declared his position. Bevin is a loyal servant of the capitalists and has given the best performance of bowing to money and American imperialists.

### Review of the European Recovery Program: British, French, and Italian Talks Conclude; Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg Secretly Contact Britain and France at the Beginning of Next Month

[Reuters, Rome, 24th] The British Embassy issued a communique announcing that the talks between Britain, France, and Italy on the Marshall Plan have successfully concluded. The main matters reviewed during the meeting were the economic progress since the Paris Sixteen Nations Conference, including European cooperation and the implementation of the national plans of each participating group. The meeting also studied the steps to be taken to establish a continuing structure in which all countries willing to participate in the European Recovery Program can participate. Furthermore, the British and French delegations will visit the capitals of other European countries participating in the Marshall Plan.

[United Press, The Hague, 24th] The Dutch Foreign Ministry announced today that delegations from the British and French governments are scheduled to meet here on February 3 with delegations from the Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg customs union to discuss the Marshall Plan. The head of the Dutch delegation, Hans區斐爾, stated that the meeting will discuss the relationship between the sixteen European countries participating in the Marshall Plan.

[United Press, Bari, Italy, 24th] U.S. Ambassador to Italy Dunn stated: The Communist Party's claim that the United States intends to turn Italy into a U.S. colony is "a despicable and unfounded slander." Dunn's first formal response to the Communist Party's attacks on U.S. aid to Europe, Dunn attacked the left-wing newspapers' attacks as attacks on the U.S. government's aid program to Italy. The left-wing newspapers have made great efforts to make the Italian people believe that transporting goods to supply food rations and transporting coal to prevent workers from losing their jobs is equivalent to U.S. imperialism. In some cases, this slander even claimed that the purpose of U.S. aid is to turn Italy into a U.S. colony.

### Vandenberg Proposes Independent Agency to Manage the Marshall Plan; President Has the Right to Decide If There Are Problems

[United Press, Washington, 25th] Secretary of State Marshall's proposal that the European aid program be managed by the State Department has been opposed by many parties. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg advocates that it be governed by an independent agency. His plan, which was drafted by the Brookings Institution at Vandenberg's request, was released by Vandenberg yesterday. The content is to establish a special department, headed by a minister-level official appointed by the President and approved by the Senate. The Secretary of State and the State Department can only raise questions and protests. If there is any dispute between the two parties, it will be handled by the President. In addition, Democratic Senator George also said: "I firmly believe that the final governing body should be independent. Our donations and their uses should be decided by experienced administrative officials and committees."

### Mountbatten to Resign in June; An Indian Will Be Selected to Succeed Him as Governor-General

[Reuters, New Delhi, 25th] The Indian government announced today that Lord Mountbatten has decided to resign as Governor-General of India in the first week of June. Mountbatten informed the Indian Constituent Assembly on August 15 of last year, the day Britain transferred power to India, that he would apply for resignation on the 4th of this year. Later, Mountbatten stated that if India could have an Indian to serve as the constitutional head of state, India could feel more fully free. It is expected that India will not leave the British Commonwealth until the end of this year. After Mountbatten resigns as Governor-General, an Indian will succeed him as Governor-General.

### Kashmir Incident: Britain Urges India and Pakistan to Reconcile

Police Agree to Draft Voting Plan

[Reuters, Lake Success, 24th] The Indian and Pakistani delegations have agreed to draft a plan to hold elections in Kashmir. This agreement was reached after the Security Council extended the discussion of the Kashmir case, which had been ongoing for a week. British representative Bagg urged the delegations of the two countries to submit a reasonable and peaceful compromise plan by Monday, pointing out that if the conflict in Kashmir is allowed to continue, it may expand, and if it unfortunately develops into a war, it will be the most terrible thing in Indian history. The way to avoid war is to reach an agreement in the Security Council. The French representative put forward three conditions for holding a referendum: Foreign troops withdraw from Kashmir; The original residents who fled return to Kashmir; A neutral administrative body is established to avoid putting pressure on residents. It is reported that after the Indian and Pakistani delegations submit the referendum plan, the Chairman of the Security Council will convene a round table meeting.

A spokesman for the Ministry of External Affairs stated that the discussion will focus on the problems caused by Britain's abandonment of the Palestine Mandate. Related parties also stated that the revision of the 1946 British-Transjordan treaty is also on the agenda.

### Arab Armed Forces Cross the Border into the Holy Land

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 24th] Official announcement: 750 Arab troops, equipped with light armored vehicles and other sophisticated weapons and several trucks, infiltrated Palestine from Transjordan and have established a headquarters in the mountains northeast of Nablus. This is the largest Arab armed force to infiltrate the Holy Land since the UN General Assembly established the partition resolution. They are led by senior Arab military officers. The British army did not notice them crossing the border. The British army has been ordered to step up security on the border to prevent further infiltration. At the same time, the Palestinian government has protested to the Transjordan government about this matter. According to Arab sources, no fewer than hundreds of Arab armed forces have infiltrated Palestine from abroad in recent weeks, and now there are thousands of well-trained Arabs gathered in the mountains of Nablus, waiting for an opportunity to go to war.

Aim to Increase Export Trade

### Japanese Government Drafts Five-Year Economic Plan

Aim to Increase Export Trade

[News Agency, Tokyo, 24th] The Japanese government is drafting a five-year economic plan, hoping to export more than one billion yuan of goods annually starting in 1951, which is four times the current export volume. The American occupation authorities believe that this long-term goal can be achieved based on the current rate of economic progress. Newspapers have published Japan's self-help plan, which increases imports annually, so there will still be a trade deficit in 1952. The details for this year show exports of 19 million U.S. dollars and imports of 781 million U.S. dollars, all of which are food and industrial raw materials. According to the occupation authorities, the export target for 1948 can be achieved, but the import estimate is inevitably too high.

### Cloth for Relieving Refugee Overseas Chinese Arrives in Southeast Asia for Distribution

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 24th] The cloth provided by our government to relieve overseas Chinese refugees in Java and Sumatra will be distributed by the Chinese General Association here.

### Vice President Hatta Tells Reporters That Indonesia Will Form a Mixed Cabinet to Implement a Ceasefire and Continue Negotiations with the Netherlands

[Reuters, Batavia, 24th] Indonesian Republic Vice President Hatta told reporters in Yogyakarta on the 24th that he intends to organize a "Presidential Business Cabinet" to succeed the Xia Lifuting Cabinet. Observers believe that Hatta's words indicate that he will select cabinet members regardless of party affiliation, based on efficiency. Hatta also announced his new government's four-point plan, namely: Implement the ceasefire agreement; Continue negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations Mediation Committee; Implement state-owned programs within the Republic; Launch a revival plan.

### The Indonesian Mediation Committee Once Flew to Yogyakarta to Study the Truth About the Indonesian Cabinet Tide

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 25th, United Press] Members of the United Nations Indonesian Mediation Committee returned to Batavia after visiting Yogyakarta for a day and holding political discussions with Indonesian representatives there.

[United Press, Batavia, 25th] Important members of the United Nations Mediation Committee flew to the capital of the Indonesian Republic on the 24th to inspect whether the cabinet tide of the Republic means that the agreement reached between Indonesia and the Netherlands last week has come to an end. The cabinet resigned on the 23rd due to attacks from the Nationalist Party, which expressed great dissatisfaction with the terms of the agreement. Vice President Hatta plans to form a new cabinet, but detailed plans have not yet been released. The United Nations representatives who flew to the Indonesian capital included American representative Graham, Australian Deputy Representative Cretzili, Belgian Deputy Representative Freeman, and U.S. State Department advisor Ogben. The Indonesian Nationalist Party opposes the terms of the agreement, which allow the Dutch to temporarily control the rich rice and rubber areas of Java and Sumatra. The basic issue of the conflict is: How can the Dutch still maintain their control after being driven out by the Japanese army in this area in 1942? They had agreed last year to recognize the United States of Indonesia (composed of the Republic of Indonesia and two other states) and the Kingdom of the Netherlands as equal members of the Dutch-Indonesian Union. Although the Republic's representatives have accepted the Dutch proposal, the agitated Indonesian Nationalist Party still insists on complete independence.

### Soviet Ambassador Pan Youxin Advocates Expanding Trade Between the U.S. and the Soviet Union to Improve Diplomatic Relations Between the Two Countries

He said that the people of both countries are interested in this action, and criticized certain people in the U.S. government for attempting to obstruct U.S.-Soviet trade relations with "discriminatory" provisions. He did not specify what the so-called discrimination refers to, but clearly referred to the recent announcement by the U.S. Department of Commerce to tighten export controls. Asked whether the increasing differences between the U.S. and the Soviet Union are inevitable, the ambassador replied that the Soviet Union's foreign policy is based on the premise that the two major countries can coexist.

### Hull's Memoirs, Copyright by North American Newspaper Alliance, Translated by Our Editorial Department: Roosevelt Was a Charismatic Figure

During my twelve years in the State Department, the President and I never spoke to each other in harsh terms. Of course, we sometimes had important disagreements, but we were always able to resolve them sincerely, frankly, and in a friendly spirit. In general, our relationship was extremely harmonious.

The President respected the condition I had set when I accepted the position of Secretary of State, which was that I did not want to be merely a messenger between our government and foreign governments, but that I wanted to fully participate in the formulation and implementation of foreign policy.

He and I shared the same views on most aspects of international relations. If something new developed when we were not together, either of us could often guess what action the other would take. This similarity of views on foreign policy was a major factor in our good working relationship.

In these memoirs, I will mainly write about the work of our government in handling foreign affairs. I do not intend to describe the achievements of the Roosevelt administration in domestic affairs. The President was the primary architect of these efforts. The domestic panic that the Roosevelt administration inherited from the previous administration, as well as the remedies devised under his leadership and the unprecedented major reforms implemented, were enough to earn him a high and permanent place in our country's domestic history. I also do not intend to describe the President's achievements as Commander-in-Chief of our armed forces in the recent World War, except for certain aspects related to joint diplomatic and military policies that may be occasionally touched upon. His outstanding achievements in military affairs have also made him one of the most talented commanders-in-chief in our history. In short, he was a truly great president.

During my tenure in the State Department, I found that in most cases, I had to make decisions on my own. Although the Secretary of State should consult with the President on important policy matters and is the President's agent in foreign affairs, in practice, the Secretary of State often acted according to his own ideas and assumed responsibility for them. I could issue instructions to American representatives abroad, request explanations from foreign representatives stationed in our country, send diplomatic notes to foreign governments, and negotiate treaties with these governments.

I had to use my own judgment to determine whether certain policies or developments were important enough to bring to the President's attention. Sometimes I presented a question involving new policies to the President, along with appropriate recommendations. At other times, a question, although related to government policy, was not very important and did not need to be brought to his attention, or the question fell within the scope of a general policy or a well-established idea that he had already endorsed.

For example, during the Italo-Abyssinian War, I advocated moral sanctions, paying particular attention to Italy. The President was on a cruiser near the coast of Mexico at the time. I told him that if he agreed, we would suggest announcing the sanctions in his name, and he immediately agreed.

Another example is our efforts to mediate the Chaco War at the Montevideo Pan-American Conference. I regarded this work as part of the conference's various procedures to promote peace and took appropriate decisions. I kept the President informed of the general progress of the work.

Another example is my negotiations with Britain to lease bases from Newfoundland and British Guiana in exchange for fifty overage American destroyers. The President and I discussed this issue once and reached a general understanding. He then transferred the task of negotiating with Britain to me. I spent ten full days on this work, keeping the President informed of the progress of the negotiations. When the negotiations were concluded, I was responsible for signing on behalf of the government. In addition, I was responsible for exchanging a telegram with Churchill, during which he formally guaranteed that the British Navy would never, under any circumstances, fall into German hands or be scuttled.

There are many other examples, too numerous to mention. The last example is the negotiations with the Japanese ambassador in the nine months before the Pearl Harbor attack. I held forty or fifty meetings with the Japanese ambassador, most of them in my hotel apartment. I kept the President informed of the main points of the discussion and arranged for the President to meet with the ambassador, preparing materials.

Neither the President nor I had much experience in the technical aspects of handling foreign affairs. Because we immediately encountered countless problems that had to be dealt with, we quickly gained this experience. The major task of implementing policies and applying basic principles to the extremely complex problems that needed to be solved abroad largely fell on my shoulders. Especially in the early years, my work became even more burdensome because of the indescribable chaos in the domestic situation, which required the President's extraordinary attention every day.

During President Roosevelt's first term, he was so immersed in domestic problems that he left me almost entirely responsible for foreign affairs. I kept him fully informed of all major developments, but he wanted me to take the initiative in policy and action. From his second term onwards, his interest in and actual participation in foreign affairs greatly increased.

Roosevelt had an extremely broad knowledge of foreign affairs. Since Jefferson and Adams, no president has had a broader knowledge of foreign peoples and situations. Although he sometimes contacted the heads of other governments directly, making it difficult for us to deal with, and he forgot the diplomatic implications of his military decisions, his view of the world was progressive and visionary.

He was a figure of great personal charisma, and he was often able to make himself affable and attractive in conversation, which was helpful in dealing with foreign politicians and diplomats. He had a rare judgment of human psychology and was often able to communicate an idea or appeal most effectively to the public. In this regard, I don't think anyone can compare to him except for Theodore Roosevelt. His most successful performance was to announce great slogans and principles, such as the Four Freedoms, to the world in a very dramatic form. His extensive knowledge of people, his vitality, and his consistently accurate judgment made him extremely suitable to be a leader.

With very few exceptions, the President could hardly have been more considerate during my twelve years as Secretary of State. He almost invariably approved my opinions or suggestions, which often involved important foreign policy issues. Except for his meetings with Churchill and Stalin, which he saw as primarily military in nature, he almost always consulted my opinion or consent before taking important steps in diplomatic relations. In many, many cases, he wanted me to provide material for diplomatic speeches or to help him draft messages and responses to Churchill, Stalin, and other heads of government.

Harry Hopkins once told me that a person could serve President Roosevelt for any length of time, and the President would never thank him. But Hopkins went on to say that Roosevelt was, in fact, always grateful for everything that such a person did for him. I replied that my relationship with him had always been seamless, with no disagreements. I also said that in many cases, he expressed full appreciation for certain aspects of my work.

When the President or I returned from a trip, or after a period of absence, he almost always notified me and invited me to his office for lunch, so that we could discuss various issues and situations without disturbance.

Lunch was brought in (without alcohol) and placed on the large desk in his oval office. I was very familiar with this office. It was in this room that I first met President Wilson, and later Presidents Coolidge and Hoover.

Our conversations were informal. The President often had an interesting story he had just heard to tell. After that, we could discuss current issues for about an hour. There were always only the two of us, with very few interruptions, although sometimes important people would call and the President would have to answer.

In conversation, he was always considerate of the other person. Sometimes when we disagreed on important issues, and I argued from the opposing side, he never showed any impatience. He listened attentively until I was finished, without interrupting. Often when one of us knew that the other held a firm belief after careful consideration, we would avoid excessive debate at the appropriate time.

Our conversations were almost entirely about foreign affairs, but sometimes I would not hesitate to express my views on general domestic issues. On a few occasions, I seemed to say something like, "Since my youth, I have studied free-thinking mentors like Locke, Milton, Pitt, Burke, and Gladstone, as well as the Georgist school. I was influenced by Wilson's free thinking, and my record in Congress involved 90 to 100 percent of labor-related issues, mainly concerning progressive legislation. But I can't help but feel that you are proceeding too fast and too far in some domestic reforms, without sufficient time to adapt to domestic conditions. The people do not have time to digest them. I believe that the country periodically needs time to adapt to some radical new policies, and in some respects, the policies themselves seem a bit too radical."

I also explained that I did not agree with the government's policy of spending large sums of money on domestic problems forever, and I have always advocated achieving a balanced budget based on progressive and practical policies, and that the country's sound progress in all important areas requires this as a solid foundation.

The President's attitude was always very respectful, listening to me until I finished. After that, he would continue eating or smoking, without saying anything. After a few seconds of silence, he or I would bring up something else, and the conversation would turn in another direction.

### Major Earthquake in the Philippines, Capital of Panay Island Suffers Heaviest Damage

[Reuters Pasadena, California, 24th] The Seismological Laboratory of the California Institute of Science detected a very strong earthquake at 6:01 PM Pacific Standard Time on the 24th. The epicenter was 12,000 kilometers away, and the direction could not yet be determined. Director Leech said that this was the strongest earthquake the laboratory had detected since the great Japanese earthquake of 1946. According to a report from West Bromwich, Staffordshire, England, the astronomical observatory there also detected a very strong earthquake that lasted for two and a half hours and was still ongoing. The source was either on an island in the Central Pacific or in the Patagonian waters at the southern tip of Chile.

### Senior Ship Officers Resolves Yesterday to Request Immediate Restoration of Voting Rights

Regarding the matter of participating in the Legislative Yuan elections, various senior ship officer groups held a joint emergency meeting of member representatives yesterday afternoon to discuss solutions. It was unanimously resolved to immediately telegraph President Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government and relevant authorities, requesting that the measures for senior ship officers to participate in the elections be announced immediately upon receipt of the telegram. If the government and the election authorities still do not provide clear instructions for restoring the deprived rights to vote and to be elected within days, then senior ship officers nationwide have decided to surrender their certificates and wait to take the examination and obtain legal certificates before practicing their profession again.

### Yang Junming Discusses Identity Issue

More than a hundred members of the Shanghai Journalists' Association, including Yan Fuzhou, jointly submitted a report to the National Occupational Women's Election Authority to investigate the identity issue of Yang Junming, a candidate for the Eastern European National Assembly, as reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday, Yang Junming happened to be in Shanghai on business, and a reporter from the Huadong News Agency went to interview him. According to Yang, he had just returned to Shanghai from Nanjing this morning and had not heard about the investigation into his qualifications by the Shanghai Journalists' Association. He had not had time to read the newspapers from the previous two days since arriving in Shanghai, so he was unaware of all the details. When the reporter asked about his past experience, he replied that he had done work in all areas, and because he was ashamed of not having made any achievements, the news media might feel unfamiliar with him. However, he was nominated by the party (the Democratic Socialist Party) to participate in the National Assembly election. If the members of the Journalists' Association had indeed taken this action, he personally had no objections, and he believed that the party might express opinions on his behalf after the election authorities officially replied and announced their decision. Finally, when asked if he felt surprised by the actions of the Journalists' Association, he laughed and said, "Why not ask the members of the Journalists' Association?"

### Zhang Xiaosong Resigns, Mayor Wu Persuades Him to Stay

Mr. Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Civil Affairs, has been in charge of civil affairs for two years. In the past, he handled the reorganization of household registration, conscription, and the National Assembly and Legislative Yuan elections. His work was heavy, and his achievements were outstanding. Now, due to health problems, he suddenly submitted his resignation. It is said that Mayor Wu has persuaded Mr. Zhang to stay. However, according to Director Zhang, he told a reporter from the Huadong News Agency yesterday that he was physically unable to continue and wished to step down and make way for a capable person. His intention to resign was extremely firm, and if it was not approved this time, he would prepare to submit his resignation again.

### Speaker Pan Invited to Give a Broadcast Speech Today

Speaker Pan has been invited by Mr. Yu Shuping, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, to give a broadcast speech at 3:15 PM today on the seventh floor of the bureau's headquarters in the northern district. The topic of his speech is: "Please pay attention to the activities of the City Council."

### Minister Yu and Others Meet Again, Decision to Implement Comprehensive Rice Rationing Starting in March

Rationing Quantity May Change

After arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, Minister of Food Yu Feipeng invited Mayor Wu, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Ren Xianqun, Standing Committee Member of the Civil Food Allocation Committee, at 6:00 PM yesterday to discuss the comprehensive rice rationing in the city and the expansion of the Civil Food Allocation Committee's organization. According to Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Minister Yu's visit to Shanghai resulted in the decision to implement rice rationing in the city starting in March. The original quantity was set at two dou per person per month, with one dou rationed by the government and another ten dou provided with a purchase permit to buy from the market. However, according to Minister Yu, the Ministry of Food recently received opinions from foreign experts suggesting that a consumption of one dou and five sheng of rice per person per month is sufficient. The Ministry of Food is still considering the rationing quantity and may ration one dou and eight sheng of rice per person per month, with eight sheng rationed by the government and a purchase permit issued for one dou of rice. As for the price of the rationed rice, Mr. Wu said that it would likely be calculated at 60% of the market price for that month. Currently, industrial and professional workers in the city are rationed at 240,000 yuan per dan, which is based on 60% of the current market price. After the comprehensive rationing is implemented, this matter will be handled by the Shanghai Municipal Civil Food Allocation Committee. However, the committee's staffing is very small, and the previous committee requested the Executive Yuan to expand and reorganize the agency, and to send personnel from the central government to preside over it, so as to facilitate the promotion of allocation matters. It is reported that Minister Yu plans to ask Mayor Wu to serve as the chairman of the reorganized allocation agency, and Director Wu and Ren Guqun to serve as the vice-chairmen. It has not yet been decided whether to continue to use the original name of "Civil Food Allocation Committee" or change it to another name, but the reorganization date should be announced in early February.

### Social Affairs Bureau Calls Together Grain Merchants, Discussion Meeting to be Held This Morning

This city is the first region to implement comprehensive food rationing. In order to ensure that the city's grain merchants understand the significance of food rationing and the specific measures, the Social Affairs Bureau has specifically scheduled a discussion meeting for the administrators of the city's north and south grain markets at 9:00 AM today to report on various matters related to rice rationing.

### Wenzhou Rice Prices Soar, Fellow Townsmen Plan to Transport Relief

Wenzhou and its neighboring counties are rice-producing areas, and normally rice prices are much lower than in Shanghai. Recently, however, prices have suddenly soared, with only seven jin of rice being purchased for every 100,000 yuan, meaning that the price per shi has reached as high as 2,200,000 yuan. Moreover, the grain supply is lacking, making it difficult to find grain to buy, and the people are panicked. The situation is very serious. A few days ago, the Wenzhou Fellow Townsmen's Association in Shanghai held a meeting of directors and supervisors, and the chairman of the association, Yao Baozhen, proposed the issue of how to provide relief for the Wenzhou grain shortage. Subsequently, the association received a joint telegram from social figures in Wenzhou requesting that rice and flour be purchased and transported to Wenzhou. The association specifically convened an emergency symposium yesterday. Because the transportation of food between Shanghai and Wenzhou is prohibited, it was decided to telegraph the Ministry of Food requesting a certificate to allow the purchase of 10,000 bags of rice from Wuhu to be transported to Wenzhou for emergency relief, and Xu Jiqin, Yao Baozhen, and Zhang Yimiao were designated to go to Beijing to seek instructions. It is reported that the association has already telegraphed the Ministry of Food.

### Gold and Silver Jewelry Transactions Expected to Resume After the New Year

Since the State Council passed the measures to open up gold jewelry transactions, the city's gold and silver jewelry industry has been actively preparing to resume business. The Economic Affairs Administration has begun to handle the re-registration of the gold and silver jewelry industry, and temporary business licenses will be issued after the audit is qualified. It is reported that this work will be completed before the end of the lunar year, and it is expected that all businesses will resume after the New Year. The only remaining problem is the labor cost, which is still being discussed. According to central government regulations, the selling price of gold jewelry, in addition to the balance exchange listing price, is subject to an additional 40% for business expenses and 20% for legal profits. However, including labor costs, it should not exceed 92%. Now Shanghai requests 100%, which is not much different from the central government regulations, so the issue of resuming business can generally be considered resolved.

### Visiting Shelters in Wind and Snow: Many Refugees Cry "Not Enough to Eat," Kneel and Beg to Go Out; Dredging of Bingdong Puhuitang Halted

[Our Paper's Report] Amidst continuous wind and snow, the Winter Relief Association is intensifying its efforts to shelter refugees and is distributing warm clothing in various districts. Mobile porridge distribution vehicles were also dispatched yesterday to supplement the inadequate supply at various porridge stations. The Relief Association's Deputy Director and Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Kaixian, along with Yuan Wenzhang, Deputy Leader of the Inspection and Distribution Group and Director of the Fourth Division of the Social Affairs Bureau, and reporters from various newspapers, visited the Third Labor Relief Shelter and the First and Second Relief Shelters yesterday morning.

The Third Labor Relief Shelter is located at No. 1 Zhongshan Road Bridge and houses 250 refugees. They are tasked with dredging Puhuitang and are accommodated in newly built thatched sheds. The refugees at the shelters are provided with two dou of rice per person per month. Due to the need for manual labor, the working refugees are specially allocated 24 liang of rice per person per day. They earn 15,000 yuan for every cubic meter of earth they excavate. If they work hard, they can excavate two cubic meters a day. However, in this open field where the cold wind cuts like a knife, working barefoot in the river is a miserable task. Yesterday, due to the severe cold, the river was full of ice, and the excavation work was halted.

The First Relief Shelter is located at the site of the former Disabled Persons' Home next to Guanshengyuan Farm in Caohejing. It currently houses 735 able-bodied refugees and 379 orphaned children, totaling 1,114 people. The Second Relief Shelter is located within the Shengsheng Pasture on the Shanghai-Minhang Road and houses 910 elderly, weak, women, and children. When Director Wu visited, many refugees cried, "Not enough to eat!" Some even knelt and wept, begging to be allowed to leave. Director Wu instructed the management personnel of each shelter that, going forward, representatives elected by the refugees should participate in the rice measuring process during cooking.

Extreme Cold Breaks Records: Temperature Below Freezing All Day

Under the influence of the Siberian cold wave, the weather in the city yesterday was frigid all day, with temperatures consistently below freezing. According to meteorological reports, the center of the cold wave has gradually reached the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, causing the city's temperature to break new cold records. The highest temperature was only 28.8 degrees Fahrenheit, equivalent to minus 1.8 degrees Celsius, and the lowest was only 24 degrees Fahrenheit, equivalent to minus 4.3 degrees Celsius. The northwest wind howled, with a force of four, and this extremely cold weather is expected to last for several days. However, with the center of the cold wave directly hitting Shanghai, the weather today will be even colder than yesterday. The weather forecast is as follows: Yellow Sea: Cloudy and icy, haze, moderate north wind, medium waves. Central China: Cloudy to overcast, cold haze, local snow or fog, fog in the morning and evening, brisk north wind. Shanghai: Cloudy to overcast, cold and icy, haze, brisk northwest to north wind, light fog in the morning and evening. East China Sea: Overcast, cold, rain or drizzle along the coast, strong north wind, rain around the southeast and Kyushu, huge waves, turbulent waves around Taiwan.

### Social Affairs Bureau Determined to Ban Dancing: Extension Requests Will Not Be Considered

[Our Paper's Report] According to the regulations for implementing the ban on dancing, half of the city's 29 dance halls should be eliminated by lottery by the end of this month and close down by the end of March. The remaining dance halls will all be closed by the end of September. Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu stated his determination to ban dancing yesterday, indicating that he would not consider the requests from dance hall operators and dancers who held a meeting recently to request an extension of the lottery. The Social Affairs Bureau is determined to implement the central government's measures. Regarding the lottery, the dance hall industry association was previously instructed to handle it themselves, with the Social Affairs Bureau sending personnel to supervise. With the deadline approaching, if the dance hall operators refuse to hold the lottery by then, the Social Affairs Bureau will draw lots on the 31st at the bureau to determine which dance halls should be eliminated and order them to close by the end of March.

### Vegetable Market Destroyed by Fire, Ground Goods Businesses Have No Shelter: Request for Reconstruction Rejected by City Government

[Our Paper's Report] After the Central Vegetable Market in the Zhabei West District of the city was destroyed by fire, the centralized placement of vegetables has become very difficult. With the arrival of severe winter and no shelter, the vegetables are freezing. The person in charge of the association submitted a document to the City Government requesting permission to build tiled houses on the original site. The City Government convened a meeting of relevant agencies on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 3:00 PM, chaired by City Government Counselor Wang Zhaoquan, with the participation of Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zukang, as well as representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau, Land Administration Bureau, Education Bureau, Zhabei West District Planning Committee, and more than a dozen others. The meeting resolved that the request to rebuild tiled houses was absolutely unacceptable. There are two reasons: It conflicts with urban planning. The Zhabei West District has been designated as an urban planning demonstration area, and the original site of the Central Vegetable Market has been designated as a prime residential area, so the construction of a vegetable market will not be allowed. Land ownership is unclear. The land rights of the site are not owned by the market, and the owner has the right to reclaim it, so the City Government cannot issue a construction permit. However, the City Government authorities, because the area is a centralized vegetable distribution area in the city, and to avoid affecting vegetable prices, has specially sought a plot of public land in Caojiadu through the Land Administration Bureau for the construction of a market. However, it must be approved by the Council and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. However, there are many requests for the use of the public land in Caojiadu from various departments, and the meeting resolved to ask Mayor Wu to grant special approval.

Temporary Permission to Build Thatched Houses

Furthermore, the rental procedures for the above items will take one or two months to complete, and construction will also take a considerable amount of time. The Central Market has indicated that it will not be able to wait. The association has now decided to allow the immediate construction of several thatched houses on the approved land to store vegetables. However, once the rental procedures for the public land in Caojiadu are completed, they will be immediately demolished to avoid hindering the city's urban planning.

### Little Tiger at Tea Shop Valued at 50 Million

[Our Paper's Report] Chen Li's little tiger at Datong Tea Shop at No. 165 Jinling Middle Road has not yet been sold. When reporters visited yesterday, it was curled up in a corner of the cage with its eyes closed, looking quite languid.

This pair of little tigers was brought to Shanghai by a Huizhou man who hunted them in the mountains and fields for consignment sales. Since the news was published in the newspaper, many people have come to see them, and there has been no shortage of people who want to buy them. Several customers are willing to pay around 20 million yuan, and a foreigner is willing to pay 50 US dollars, but the tiger owner is asking for 50 million yuan, and the difference between the two sides is too great, so no deal has been reached. According to the shop assistant at the tea shop, Hu Wenhu, the owner of Wan Jin You, once sent someone to take a look. Zhang Daqian, a famous painter of tigers, also came to "appreciate" them himself. He thought the tiger was too small and not qualified to be painted. The skin color of the little tiger is similar to that of a "bamboo joint cat" and does not look very beautiful. Datong Tea Shop borrowed a large iron cage from the City God Temple Zoo yesterday, and will move it from the original small wooden cage starting today. The shop assistants at the tea shop also take it out of the cage every night and play with it on a chain. It is said that as long as you don't anger it, the little tiger won't bite.

Hu Wenhu Sent Someone to Take a Look; Zhang Daqian Thought It Was Not Good Enough to Paint

### Campaign for National Reconstruction Energetically Held All Day

The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Kuomintang, in order to strengthen the mobilization campaign for national reconstruction, despite yesterday being Sunday, the Publicity Department, led by Director Tan, personally led more than 100 colleagues from the entire propaganda team, specially equipped with two large trucks, divided into two groups for costumed propaganda and speeches, and departed from morning to night to various districts of the city to carry out propaganda, When the car passed Nanjing Road, it shouted slogans. When it reached Minguo Road, a band from the Municipal Children's Education Institute participated. The propaganda team of the team performed street dramas about the atrocities of the Communist bandits in more than a dozen places such as Xinzha Road and Changle Road. The plot was realistic and the audience was moved. The speech team went to theaters such as Nanjing, Huguang, Penglai, and Gongwutai to give simple speeches, and the audience was moved. Especially after the speech at the Xinhua Dance Hall, the whole venue sang the March of the Volunteers, and the atmosphere was tense and enthusiastic.

### The Day the Cherry Blossoms are in Full Bloom Will Likely Be the Day the Enemy Leaders are Convicted: Final Debate Session Can Be Held This Week; Mei Ruao Flies to Tokyo This Morning to Resume His Post

Mr. Mei Ruao, the representative judge of our country stationed at the Far East International Tribunal, returned to the country a week ago to report on his work and has been approved to fly to Tokyo on a Northwest Airlines flight at 7:00 this morning to resume his post. According to Mr. Mei, who told reporters yesterday: The "Final Debate Session" of the Far East International Tribunal can be held this week. The prosecutors and defendants will each submit and read their prepared "Comprehensive Arguments" to the court. These arguments are an analysis and review of all the documents and court records accepted by the court since the trial began 20 months ago, and each will make judgments and debate with each other. It not only summarizes the facts, but also involves legal issues. Most of the arguments have been completed and exchanged between the two parties for review in advance so that they can confront each other and avoid irrelevant topics. This attitude is truly fair and enlightened, truly "gentlemanly in their disputes."

Deliberation Meeting · Requires More Time

Mr. Mei predicts that the comprehensive arguments of both parties will be more than 3,000 pages long and will take about four weeks to complete. After the debate session ends, the public trial will end, followed by the deliberation meeting of the eleven judges to determine the sentence of the 25 defendants and draft the verdict, and then schedule a sentencing date. The court will also announce its adjournment. When asked by reporters how long the deliberation meeting would take during the adjournment period and when the formal sentencing would begin, Mr. Mei replied: I cannot make a definitive prediction on this matter at this time. The Nuremberg International Tribunal's judges' meeting only took 29 days, but the Tokyo case is complex, involves a longer period of time, and has more defendants, and the number of documents and court records is more than twice that of Nuremberg, so the deliberation meeting in Tokyo will be longer than in Nuremberg. This can be asserted. However, according to my personal prediction, around April of this year, the day the cherry blossoms are in full bloom in Ying, will likely be the day the enemy leaders are convicted.

Eradicate Aggression · Promote Peace

When asked again about the approximate sentences of the future convicts and how many of them could be sentenced to death, Mr. Mei replied that, according to general judicial practice, judges should not comment on pending cases, and especially should not make any predictions about the outcome of the trial. However, the Far East International Tribunal does not apply "free conviction" but purely adopts "material evidence doctrine", so the judges will not pay attention to the arbitrary propaganda of both parties, but for war criminals with obvious crimes and conclusive evidence, they will not allow them to escape the solemn international legal justice trial. Finally, Mr. Mei told reporters in a firm tone: The purpose of the Tokyo trial is not only the life and death sentences of 25 Class A war criminals in Japan, but also to establish a new principle of international law to eradicate international aggression and help promote lasting world peace. From this point of view, although the Tokyo trial consumes a lot of human and financial resources, it has great historical significance and a sacred mission.

### Rehabilitation Service for the Wounded and Disabled: Adding Mechanical Woodworking Classes

The Shanghai Rehabilitation Service for the Wounded and Disabled, located at No. 80 Hualong Road, has now registered 62 wounded and disabled citizens. In addition to referring the wounded and disabled to municipal hospitals for treatment, the agency also attaches great importance to job referrals and vocational training. Its purpose is to enable the wounded and disabled to become self-reliant and self-sustaining. It has organized vocational training classes for the wounded and disabled, one at the Nan Shi Christian Benefit Society and one in a private home. The above two classes are both centered on sewing. Recently, it has jointly established mechanical and woodworking classes with Jinhua Vocational School, which are now ready and can begin training.

### International Hotel Manager Returns from Inspection Trip: Talks About the Latest Developments in the Hotel Industry in Europe and the United States

[Our Paper's Report] Mr. Lin Mianzhi, manager of the International Hotel, recently toured various European and American countries at the invitation of the World Travel Industry Association and the American Travel Industry Association to inspect the hotel facilities and business conditions, lasting for four months. Mr. Lin returned to Shanghai a few days ago and told reporters yesterday about his impressions of this trip: In the United States, any business is operated on a large scale, and hotels are no exception. For example, the largest Stevens Hotel has more than 3,000 rooms. The hotel itself is like a small city, with all the necessities of life. Ordinary hotels have about 500 to 2,000 rooms, and the smallest ones are at least 150 rooms. At the same time, branch hotels belonging to the same organization are located all over the country, almost similar to the trust system in commerce. The excellent management and equipment are self-evident, and efficiency is especially emphasized. For example, fee collection uses specially designed machines that can issue bills within seconds of any consumption behavior of the passenger. Hotel doors are mostly automatically opened and closed using infrared principles.

The United States Lacks Manpower, Europe Lacks Food

However, in terms of service, because the United States lacks manpower, it is not as thoughtful as the hotels in our country. Recently, two things about the hotel industry in the United States are worth mentioning. One is that the number of mobile hotels built along highways is increasing. These mobile hotels attract many travelers because of their convenience and comfort, which greatly affects the business of formal hotels. The second is that there is a growing shortage of culinary talents in hotels, which those in charge are quite worried about.

In Europe, the devastation of the war has not yet been fully restored, and at the same time, food is scarce and the rationing system is strictly enforced, so the equipment and supplies of hotels are worse than those in the United States. London is especially bad. However, its prices are the highest in the world, with first-class hotels charging a room rate of 5 to 10 pounds per day.

Strict Organization of Associations, Spirit Worthy of Emulation

Mr. Lin finally expressed his impressions in several points: The hotel industry is part of the travel industry. The governments of European and American countries provide assistance and cooperation to the hotel industry. If our country wants to develop the travel industry and attract foreign investment, the government should also support the hotel industry. The associations of the travel industry in Europe and the United States are very well-organized, and members can cooperate sincerely and seek common development. Their spirit is especially worthy of our people's emulation. European and American countries do not have any contempt for hotel service personnel. The traditional concept in our country is completely the opposite, so young people with good qualifications and high abilities are unwilling to work in hotels, resulting in a lack of talent and difficulty in development. This kind of concept must be changed.

### Police Officer Loses Hat, Jumps Off Vehicle and Dies

[Our Paper's Report] Two police officers from the City Police Department's Mobile Vehicle Team, one named Tan Pingxin, badge number 3144, and one named Jin Hongkun (22 years old, Shandong native), were on vacation yesterday. They went to Longhua for a day of leisure. When they were walking to the Nantuo of Jingji Bridge on Xujiahui Road, the two police officers stopped a truck and jumped on it, heading south quickly. When they reached Xietu Road, Jin's police cap was blown off by the wind. In a moment of anxiety, before the driver could brake, he jumped off the vehicle and accidentally fell to the ground, suffering a concussion. When the driver Wang Zhenxing stopped to check, he had already died. Later, the police officers on duty arrived and took the witness Tan Pingxin and Wang Zhenxing to the Xujiahui Police Station for questioning to verify the matter.

### Sworn Brother Steals, Detained for Unequal Distribution of Loot

[Our Paper's Report] The Yue Dong Coal Briquette Factory at No. 361 Yichang Road lost five dan of foreign yuan car core iron on the evening of the 2nd of this month. The next morning, after discovering it, they reported it to the Putuo Road Police Station, which sent police officers to investigate in all directions, but to no avail. At about 10 p.m. the night before last, three police officers were patrolling in the Yichang Road area when they saw several people arguing on the side of the road. After questioning them, the police brought them all to the branch station. According to their confession, Meng Hanzhen, Zhang Asan, Zhang Asi, Wei Changhuai, Jiang Yuehua, and others are all sworn brothers. Meng is a worker at the Yue Dong Factory, and it was Meng who initiated and conspired to steal five dan of foreign yuan car core iron from the factory and sell it to Yao Qiaochun, who runs a second-hand goods business on the side of Xikang Road Suzhou Road, for 7.5 million yuan. Recently, due to the unequal distribution of the loot, a dispute arose. Section Chief Zhu ordered the police to arrest Yao Qiaochun and confiscate the stolen goods, and plans to send the thieves to the District Prosecutor's Office to be investigated according to law.

### Dredging of Beixinjing Section of Waterway

### Adjusting the Body and Mind of Tuberculosis Patients: The Patient Rehabilitation Workshop Opens, and the Memorial Tablet of the Late Director of the Tuberculosis Hospital is Unveiled Simultaneously

[Our Newspaper's Report] Based on 30 years of experience in the American medical community, a "Patient Rehabilitation Workshop," recognized as beneficial for tuberculosis patients to regain their health after recovery, has been established at the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association's First Tuberculosis Hospital on Hongqiao Road. Yesterday at noon, the hospital held the workshop's opening ceremony and unveiled the memorial tablet for Dr. Haysen De, the founder of the Anti-Tuberculosis Association and the late director of the Tuberculosis Hospital.

The "Patient Rehabilitation Workshop" is a craft workshop for tuberculosis patients who are either extremely weak or have recovered, providing a way to adjust their body and mind. It not only allows those who have recovered to continue to rest but also provides mental comfort to the patients. As everyone knows, people with tuberculosis are most afraid of psychological fear and anxiety.

According to a 23-year statistical result from the international medical community, 50% of recovered tuberculosis patients who were discharged from the hospital died due to recurrence of the original disease within six to eighteen months. Later, the rehabilitation workshop was established, allowing those patients who were originally going to be discharged to remain in the hospital and be given work. On the one hand, they could do some light manual work, and on the other hand, they could still receive care from the hospital and rest peacefully. After two or three years of this, they would be discharged again. Within five years, only ten out of one hundred people died. There were also students who stayed in the workshop even longer. After being discharged, an investigation showed that only three out of one hundred people died within five years, which is the same as the general mortality rate. Therefore, they believe this work is absolutely effective. They would rather have patients stay in the hospital for a few more years than waste the time, energy, and money spent in the past few years.

Rest Immediately When Feeling Weak

Ouyang Jingge, the current director of the First Tuberculosis Hospital, was sponsored by the American branch of the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association to conduct a study in the United States. After fourteen months in the United States, he brought this new method back to China and immediately implemented it. Currently, there are more than 20 people participating in the work in the Tuberculosis Hospital, and the products are also quite exquisite, including wool knitwear, small toys, and various "Hhncon" brand lighters self-made under the leadership of engineer Liang Chao. They are already being sold on the market. In the future, they plan to sell more products to supplement the hospital's expenses. The patients work for a maximum of one or two hours a day, stopping to rest as soon as they feel weak. Everyone takes turns working. The Rehabilitation Workshop hopes that people from all walks of life can donate old sewing machines and various handcraft tools so that patients can take this opportunity to learn more skills.

Credit Should Be Given to Dr. Haysen De

As for the major work of tuberculosis prevention, today's progress in China must be credited to American Dr. Haysen De. Yesterday, before the unveiling ceremony of the memorial tablet, Dr. Fu Wen, on behalf of Yan Huiqing, the president of the Anti-Tuberculosis Association (who did not attend due to a cold), reported on Dr. Hay's life, briefly stating that Dr. Haysen De had served in Shanghai before the Sino-Japanese War. He paid special attention to the treatment of leprosy, which few people were willing to do, and cooperated with Dr. Ouyang at that time. When the war broke out in Shanghai, Dr. Haysen saw that the elderly, sick, and tuberculosis patients in the refugee camps were the most distressed and no one paid attention to them. Therefore, he established an Anti-Tuberculosis Association on Jiqi Road, followed by a Tuberculosis Hospital in a hospital on Bailinan Road. At that time, he received assistance from Shi Zhaoji, the honorary president of the association, and the American Red Cross Children's Welfare Committee, allowing more than 200 patients to receive free treatment.

Unfortunately Died After Being Imprisoned by the Enemy

Haysen held three important positions: Secretary-General of the Anti-Tuberculosis Association, Director of the Tuberculosis Hospital, and Medical Designer. Later, he also ran the Second Hospital at Jiliang Institute on Yuyuan Road. On December 8th, when the Pacific War broke out, the Bailinan Road Hospital could not exist. Fortunately, Dr. Haysen received donations of about one million yuan from all walks of life and bought the current site on Hongqiao Road, moving all the patients from the Bailinan Road Hospital in. Unfortunately, Dr. Haysen was later imprisoned by the enemy in a concentration camp and died of illness at the Tongren Hospital. Dr. Fu concluded, "Our commemoration of Dr. Haysen cannot be expressed by just a copper tablet. The promotion of tuberculosis prevention and the expansion of the Tuberculosis Hospital is the best expression of commemorating Dr. Haysen."

The Latest Fluoroscope Installed on a Car

Dr. Ouyang brought back a new fluoroscope donated by the United States on this trip back to China, which will be installed on a car and used to screen citizens everywhere to prevent tuberculosis or treat it early, and can screen 600 people every day. Dr. Shi Zhaoji of the American branch of the Anti-Tuberculosis Association also launched a fundraising campaign in the United States and has already obtained 50,000 US dollars, which will be used to expand the wards of the First Hospital in the future. The hospital's wards are very cheap, with first-class including daily meals and other expenses costing 300,000 yuan per day, and there are also half-price and completely free options, some of which are subsidized by the Health Bureau. Also, Dr. Fangji, an American surgeon who worked with Dr. Haysen in the early days, still provides free medical care for the Tuberculosis Hospital, without taking any travel expenses.

Yesterday's unveiling was done by Dr. Haysen's eldest daughter, who is also a doctor and works for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), and his second daughter, who is a pharmacist. Mrs. Haysen is currently in the United States and also helped Dr. Haysen participate in the work at that time. It can be said that the whole family is working for the benefit of China.

### The Misfortunes of Overseas Chinese in Java: They Need Self-Help and Assistance from the Motherland's Government

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Batavia, Java, 14th] According to historical records, overseas Chinese first developed in the Dutch East Indies. Those of us who have lived in Batavia for many years deeply know that many of the overseas Chinese residing in Batavia are already sixth-generation descendants, and some even have eight or nine generations. Our country has never had an immigration policy. Overseas Chinese who leave their hometowns and drift around like duckweed all rely on the assistance of fellow villagers and relatives, or the "greetings" of relatives and friends. After finally arriving in the place of residence, they are mostly apprentices and coolies, always inseparable from poverty and disease. After a long period of hard work and frugality, very few are fortunate enough to start a family and create a business, and there are many who unfortunately die in a foreign land. On the whole, the majority of overseas Chinese are laborers and the poor, accounting for eight or nine out of ten. The millionaires with huge wealth are still as rare as morning stars. Our domestic compatriots must first have such an understanding of overseas Chinese and must not associate the two concepts of overseas Chinese and rich businessmen together.

Looking further, many successful overseas Chinese have accumulated mostly commercial capital. The businesses operated by overseas Chinese (such as the sugar industry of Sampo Kong Huang Jianyuan) are dependent on the local suzerain countries and are limited by colonial policies and the lack of social and national legal protection. Their capital can never be transformed into modern industrial capital. The lessons learned from the facts of the past few decades show that they are only declining and going bankrupt, and never flourishing. We must not forget the wealthy overseas Chinese in Java before the war, and we must point out this fundamental misfortune.

The "Middleman" Status is Shaken

Java has the largest population and highest density of overseas Chinese. On this island, whether in remote mountains or remote areas, there are "Taron" (small stores selling daily necessities) of overseas Chinese, which are closest to the native Indonesians. The economic status of overseas Chinese is sufficient to control the entire economic life of Indonesians. Overseas Chinese are the "middlemen" between Indonesians and the people of the Dutch ruling country. Overseas Chinese collect local products and sell daily necessities, earning limited profits.

Since the Indonesian nation loudly shouted "Merdeka" (Independence), our overseas Chinese have first fallen into an environment of endless war and low war clouds. As a result of the Indonesian-Dutch conflict, overseas Chinese have suffered casualties and property losses in the cracks, and many have even entered the "abyss of destruction." Those who are fortunate enough not to suffer from the war have had their status as "middlemen" fundamentally shaken due to the implementation of the Dutch control policy and the rise of the Indonesian people's national economic policy. Moreover, after the three-year occupation of the Japanese invaders, they tried their best to provoke and incite the Indonesians. The Indonesians completely erased our past great achievements in reclaiming wasteland and actually regarded overseas Chinese as "bloodsuckers," "Jews," and "exploitative classes," creating a widespread anti-Chinese atmosphere and formulating various laws that were unfavorable to overseas Chinese. The troops were undisciplined, and the people were inherently brutal, regarding murder and looting as commonplace.

In addition, the overseas Chinese society has always been divided, engaging in intrigue, and is now in a state of semi-split. The divisions of native place and gang, and the gap between "left-leaning elements" and "party groups." Recently, in Batavia, the matter of responding to the suppression of the rebellion telegram caused a lot of trouble and gloom. To this day, both sides are still continuing to wage a pen war. This makes it impossible for overseas Chinese to immediately unite to deal with the crisis in the face of a major disaster, and therefore, the external forces are weakened invisibly.

These various misfortunes are enough to plunge overseas Chinese into the eighteenth level of hell. The reporter looks at the changes in the world and foresees the future. I cannot help but feel worried about the unfortunate multiple misfortunes of overseas Chinese in the East Indies!

Wen Jingduo and Others Become Indonesian Citizens

The government of the motherland has always cared about overseas Chinese and valued them. Our national father even called an overseas Chinese "the mother of revolution." From the Xinhai Revolution to the July 7th Anti-Japanese War, overseas Chinese have always been the great supply station for the motherland. Especially since the Anti-Japanese War, because overseas Chinese have borne almost one-fourth of the central government's annual anti-war expenditure in the first three years of the Anti-Japanese War, the Anti-Japanese War has also raised the overseas Chinese's right to speak in the politics of the motherland. However, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the outbreak of civil strife in the motherland gave overseas Chinese a great disappointment. Overseas Chinese harbored wishful thinking, thinking that the day of the victory of the motherland's Anti-Japanese War would be the time for overseas Chinese to stand up and be proud. In fact, since the victory, the entire crisis of overseas Chinese has deepened day by day. On the one hand, it is because the government of the motherland does not have a rapid, clear, and vigorous foreign policy and active and effective measures. On the other hand, it is because some impure-minded people have infiltrated all levels of overseas Chinese society, making unreasonable attacks on the government of the motherland and doing their best to provoke, which has caused overseas Chinese to move towards a "centrifugal" movement due to disappointment and resentment towards the motherland. Many overseas Chinese are even considering whether to simply join Indonesian citizenship. Today, Wen Jingduo (football star, graduated from Jinan University), Xiao Yucan (now an Indonesian cabinet member) and others have officially joined Indonesian citizenship and are doing their best to destroy overseas Chinese in the interior of Java.

Overseas Chinese Self-Help is Imminent

We believe that the most urgent problem facing us is the problem of overseas Chinese self-help. We know that it is difficult to send troops to protect overseas Chinese, not to mention that it is difficult to do in fact. Even if the government is willing to do so, the negative effect will definitely outweigh the positive effect. Large-scale evacuation of overseas Chinese is even more impossible, and the objective environment does not allow it. Where should overseas Chinese students who have never stepped into the country be evacuated to? In this view, there is no other way than overseas Chinese self-help and the assistance of the motherland's government.

For the sake of the nation and the overseas Chinese, the commercial capital of overseas Chinese should be quickly transformed into the independent industrial capital of the motherland. What we mean is not to advocate that the small and medium-sized capitalists of overseas Chinese should be uprooted, nor do we expect to advocate the complete withdrawal of overseas Chinese overnight. But at the very least, we dare to say that overseas Chinese cannot sit and wait for death. They should raise their vigilance and step into participating in the production of the motherland, which is the way out and has a future. However, the businesses operated by overseas Chinese here are mostly not modern organizations, and the modern production technology of overseas Chinese talents is still very young. The government of the motherland should have a unified guiding agency to handle the affairs of overseas Chinese returning to the country to invest, and the government should also legislate to guarantee the profits of overseas Chinese investment. In this way, overseas Chinese capital will definitely flow back continuously.

Forming a Security Team Deters Thugs

Secondly, we need to talk about the emergency rescue of overseas Chinese. Now, overseas Chinese security teams have been established one after another in the Dutch-occupied areas. Since its establishment, it has been able to perform its sacred duties quite well. In places where overseas Chinese security teams are stationed, Indonesian thugs have been slightly deterred than before. This is what we are comforted by. I still remember that a week ago, in Puvolati Port, because there were no Dutch troops stationed there, more than 100 thugs broke into the city. There were more than 500 overseas Chinese in the port. They specially sent representatives to request the security team to go to the port to station. The security team complied with the request of the overseas Chinese and specially sent a squad of seven people, including a squad leader, to jointly protect the local youth of 20 people. When the team had just arrived at the port, the thugs suddenly attacked the security team. The security team bravely fought back, and the two sides opened fire for two hours. The thugs finally collapsed and retreated. An investigation of the actual situation revealed that security team member Liu Jinlong heroically died. The thugs left three bodies, two were Indonesians and one was a Japanese bandit. Security team member Liu's heroic sacrifice was made to protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese, and Liu can undoubtedly be called a "national hero." At the same time, it is enough to prove that the overseas Chinese security team can indeed exert its power to protect overseas Chinese.

Last month, Consul Niu Shuqu went to various parts of Central Java to inspect the situation of overseas Chinese and witnessed the pain of overseas Chinese being exiled and concentrated and the suffering of being taken advantage of. These places are all Indonesian Republics, and the responsibility cannot be pushed to the Dutch.

Therefore, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ye Gongchao advocated that security teams should also be established in the Indonesian Republic. This request is the most timely and appropriate and must be promoted to be realized as soon as possible. The general opinion here is that the overseas Chinese in the interior currently suffer the deepest pain. The Indonesian government uses the excuse to protect them, and the overseas Chinese are concentrated. Once the overseas Chinese are concentrated, not only are all their properties burned and looted by Indonesian thugs, but the lives of the overseas Chinese are also completely lost in this unplanned concentration. The overseas Chinese are either killed on the way, or die of disease and starvation in the mountain caves. The tragic situation is unbearable to imagine. Since many facts have proven that the lives and properties of overseas Chinese near the war zone are not guaranteed at all, the Indonesian authorities' refusal to allow overseas Chinese to form their own security teams the other day can be said to be completely unreasonable. We hope that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the motherland should strive for it with the Indonesian authorities in order to quickly promote its realization.

Repeated Orders Are of No Use

Indonesian President Sukarno recently exhorted the people to strictly abide by national discipline, which is worthy of attention and comfort. However, as President Sukarno himself said, if there is no action to prove what he said to the people, it will not help the facts.

But since the world-shaking Wendeng tragedy occurred, the Indonesian authorities have shown superficial remorse and have repeatedly ordered the people to abide by the law and protect overseas Chinese, and have guaranteed to our country that they will punish the murderers and compensate. But to this day, they have not detained a single principal offender or executed a single thug. It is because these words and guarantees have no action to prove, so when the Dutch "guard action" was launched this time, Indonesian thugs became even more unscrupulous and continued to massacre and burn our overseas Chinese.

The United Nations Security Council's Three-Nation Committee, which is attracting worldwide attention, seems to have not achieved any results after busy work. We have long believed that the Security Council's mediation of the Indonesian-Dutch dispute is purely to "do its best" and perfunctorily deal with both Indonesia and the Netherlands. The Dutch side seems to have never attached importance to the Security Council's resolutions from the beginning, although it does not dare to disobey the "good intentions" of some major countries too much. The Indonesian side, on the other hand, harbors wishful thinking, thinking that international pressure can make the Netherlands retreat. Looking at these three aspects of behavior, people can foresee that the situation in Indonesia will not be clear in the foreseeable future. It is only pitiful that our overseas Chinese who are drifting in the interior of Java do not know when they will be able to escape the sea of ​​suffering. (Special Correspondent Huang Haizhen)

### Spring Interlude: Wuyuan Yellow Plum Blossoms Bloom in the Cold

[Our Newspaper, Wuyuan, 22nd] The most precious plum species in our county are the green plum blossoms of Longxi and the yellow plum blossoms of Rencun. Yesterday, I made a special trip to Rencun to explore the plum blossoms. When I arrived at the garden of the old residence of the Hu family in Renli, the yellow plum blossoms leaning against a corner of the crumbling wall already had amber-colored millet grains, blooming in the cold, like stars dotted between the sturdy branches. The age of the plum tree is about 100 years or more, and the crown is like a cover, curved and graceful. Except that the pistils are yellow, the appearance of the tree is like an old plum tree, with no different differences. It is reported that this plum is dark yellow in color and is called yellow plum blossom. Its petals are also very different from wax plum blossoms. Among the plum species, it is a famous and precious product like green plum blossom. Ordinary species are mostly red and white, and there are not many yellow ones. Moreover, the flowering period of this plum must wait for it to bloom before the arrival of spring. The color is delicate and fresh. No matter whether spring comes early or late, the plum blossoms will also bloom in time. It is said to be the welcoming spring yellow plum blossom, which is born with spring.

### Surveying the Caoling Reservoir: Possible to Irrigate 750,000 Mu

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 22nd] Caoling in the mountains of Alishan, Chiayi, was caused by the great earthquake on December 18, 1941, and the torrential rain in August 1942, resulting in the second major collapse of the rain, which buried the Qingshui Creek Valley and drowned it into a lake, which has been five years now. The dam is about 200 meters high, the storage capacity is about 150 million cubic meters, and the water surface is more than 560 meters above sea level. This is a lake in the mountains. From the Alishan Railway Crossroads Station, you can see a corner of the Caoling Reservoir. This is a miracle of Taiwan's geography. According to Professor Jin Cheng of the Department of Civil Engineering of Taiwan University, who returned from the survey, the area may generate 30,000 to 40,000 KW of electricity and irrigate 50,000 A (each A is 15 mu). However, the remaining mountain peaks after the collapse of the dam and the selection of the water diversion tunnel line, including geological, hydrological, engineering and other issues, as well as the economics of utilization, need to be considered. Professor Jin will continue to conduct detailed observation and research this summer for water conservancy construction.

### Winter Relief: Soliciting One Sheng of Rice Movement

[Our Newspaper, Wujin, 24th] The Winter Relief Association of our county has launched a fundraising and clothing donation movement for winter relief, which has achieved excellent results. The first phase of rice voucher distribution began on the 24th. Recently, the association launched a one-sheng rice movement. Based on the spirit of "helping others is the source of happiness", it has been widely launched, hoping to gather small amounts into large amounts to help the poor. The donation team is organized by students from various schools. Each household is expected to donate one sheng of rice as a principle, and the more the better. For households with several households, donations are solicited on a household basis. No separate receipt will be issued, and a sign will be attached to the household. The fundraising work is scheduled to be completed in three days from the 26th to the 28th.

### Wujin Hengshan Bridge: Cracking Down on Bandit Dens

[Our Newspaper, Wujin, 25th] Hengshan Bridge, north of the road, is connected to Chengjing, which has always been the area where the bandits Zhang Zhiqiang and Yu Naizhang roamed. They usually distort propaganda, and the people have suffered greatly. Recently, Zhang Xingjie of the Qishuyan Self-Defense Force under its jurisdiction, smashed a bandit den in Longdang Village, about three miles south of Hengshan Bridge Town. The den was opened in the family of Mo Huanquan, one behind the stove, with the bamboo shelf moving in and out, and one on the top floor, with the floor slab opening and closing up and down. Each room is only four steps large, and the layout is only one bed, one table, and several benches. The bandit Mo Haoxi was also captured on the spot. According to the confession, there are a total of ten people participating in the same village, known as the "Ten Cadre Party." After being informed, they voluntarily guaranteed that the "Ten Cadre Party" would reform themselves to the government and would be willing to recruit their accomplices to surrender, and they issued a death penalty guarantee. From now on, they will work together to atone for their crimes and redeem their past mistakes.

### Suppression Work Promoted in Zhen, Chang, Dan and Yang Counties

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 24th] The Zhenchang Danyang Four Counties Suppression Headquarters ended all suppression work and handed it over to the Zhenchang Jiangfang Division Command to continue handling it. It is reported that although the Four Counties Suppression Headquarters has ended, the suppression work is still being actively promoted. The visible and invisible bandits in the nearby rural areas have mostly been gradually eliminated and can be completely wiped out before the end of this month. As for the guns distributed to the county by the Ministry of National Defense, they have now been distributed according to the actual needs of each district, so the armed forces in each township are sufficient and the local public security is also quite stable. At the same time, the Beijing-Shanghai Jiangfang Command also issued an order to all counties to complete the construction of the bunkers along the river by the end of February.

### More Than Ten Million People Hope For Construction: Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway

[Our Fuzhou Dispatch on the 15th] The Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway is the only transportation artery linking the two rich areas of eastern and southern Fujian. It was opened to traffic long before the War of Resistance. At that time, it only took a day's drive from Fuzhou on the Min River to Xiamen, the hometown of overseas Chinese, where the language is completely different. Passenger and freight transport between Fuzhou and Xiamen was half borne by this road. However, the road was closed not long after being opened to traffic due to the war. Once Jinmen, next to Xiamen, fell, this road immediately became a "blind gut." In order to prevent the enemy from taking the opportunity to invade inland, the authorities thoroughly destroyed it in the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1938].

For the past eight years, the Fuzhou-Xiamen Road has been paralyzed. Pieces of earth have been overgrown with green grass, sections of the roadbed have been turned into farmland, bridges have collapsed, and milestones have been submerged. The same journey from Fuzhou to Xiamen takes a full five days on foot. What a profound comparison between machinery and manual labor here!

The Fujian provincial authorities have been clamoring to rush to repair this highway since the day after the victory of the War of Resistance. The Provincial Highway Bureau and the Construction Department have been busy preparing plans and preparing for surveying. However, as an engineering project as long as the section from Hangzhou to Yushan Station on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, how easy is it to carry out? Moreover, at the beginning of the post-war recovery, everything needed to be done, and the treasury funds were indeed even more empty. As a result, the plan was shelved for more than a year until the Executive Yuan's Fujian Office was established last year. After relief supplies printed with (UNRRA) arrived one after another, the call for road restoration was revived. Later, after all, due to the central government's emphasis on seeking transportation solutions and the enthusiastic assistance of UNRRA foreign engineering personnel, the "Fuzhou-Xiamen Engineering Office" was formally established, and then the arduous road restoration work began.

From Fuzhou to Xiamen

The route extends as follows: Starting from Nanmendou in Fuzhou City, passing Baihuting, Xiabei, crossing the Wulong River, landing in Xinan, passing Changkou, then crossing Xiangsi Ridge, the highest peak of the entire route, reaching Honglu, Yuxi, Jiangkou, Hanjiang Town, entering Xiaotian County, then passing Fengting, entering Huian City, exiting Xingtian, here crossing the historically famous Luoyang Bridge to reach Quanzhou (Jinjiang), then passing Qianpu, Guanqiao, Shuitou, Magang to Tong'an County, then passing Guankou, Jiaowei, Songyu across the sea to Xiamen, the entire journey is 298 kilometers (the upper half is the tea and rice producing area of Fujian, the middle half is the fruit and sugar producing area of Fujian, and the lower half is the hometown of 70% of overseas Chinese from Fujian (Tan-Quan area). From an economic point of view, the importance of this road is obviously no less than that of any other highway in other provinces). With the strong help of UNRRA materials, the total cost of road restoration at that time was budgeted at only 1.9 billion yuan. However, after several changes and the passage of time, as soon as the project started, it encountered difficulties. Until today, after a year of time and hundreds of billions of wages spent, only a small section of the road from Fuzhou to Yuxi has been opened. Under such circumstances, the public cannot help but discuss and criticize it.

From my previous experience of visiting railway engineering projects in other provinces, the Fuzhou-Xiamen road project is difficult to be satisfactory.

Highway Restoration Difficulties

The degree of difficulty is no less than that of a railway. What is especially admirable is that the road actually has a large number of road restoration machines. This saves much more effort than manually opening a road in those days. (According to reports, the road currently has three graders, three bulldozers, twenty-three dump trucks, five Ford trucks, three road rollers, six mechanical repair vehicles, three stone crushers, three scrapers, four pneumatic rock drills, three sheep foot rollers, three water trucks, and countless other machines. Among them, bulldozers can push 20,000 cubic feet of soil per day, and stone crushers can crush 80 or 90 large stones per day. Shaving mud like paper and crushing stones like a millstone are both very suitable). However, since the project began, it has been progressing like a snail. Outsiders cannot easily forgive this situation. I believe that the progress of a project certainly requires material resources to cooperate with manpower, but it also requires

Manpower Driving Material Resources

Machines are only machines, and funds are only funds. Those in charge must not only know how to utilize them, but also use them well and utilize them thoroughly. Otherwise, if machines, financial resources, and manpower contradict and become disconnected from each other, how can one avoid failure? The success of the rushed repair of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway at that time relied on this point. I think the slow development of the Fuzhou-Xiamen Highway project is nothing more than this.

Some people in the local public say: "The Fuzhou-Xiamen Road has no hope of restoration." Others burst into scolding: "The Fuzhou-Xiamen project is a complete mess." Although the tone is somewhat fiery, they all express the feelings of hope that more than ten million people in Fujian have for the road. Indeed, the relationship between the Fuzhou-Xiamen Road and Fujian's transportation, economy, military, and politics in the future is too important. From any point of view, I hope that the colleagues in charge will step up their efforts and complete it as soon as possible. (Special Correspondent Huang Cen)

Nantong [Our Dispatch] More than a month after the death of Qian Xiaoyin, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, the candidate for his successor has not yet been decided. It is reported that local people are now unanimously supporting Zhang Jingli and Wu Jie to take office. Also: Huang Youlan, director of Dasheng Power Plant in Nantong Tiensheng Port, will recently go abroad for inspection and plans to order a 7,000-kilowatt generator in the United States. It is expected to be shipped by the end of this year. At that time, the original power of the entire northern Jiangsu industry can be increased to 12,000 kilowatts.

Jiading [Our Dispatch] Zhou Hui, representative of the fourth bao of Shigang Township, overcharged the households in the bao for settlement fees when enlisting volunteer soldiers last August. After the township head of the township reported to the county government, the police were ordered to arrest Zhou and transfer him to the judiciary for punishment.

Yixing [Our Dispatch] According to a secret report from the Xiaohou District, underground personnel of the bandit army were active in Zhiquan Township.

### Paradise in Jiangyin Shuangshan Sandbar

[Our Dispatch from Jiangyin on the 22nd] The sandbars belonging to Cheng [County] are located on the riverbank. The constant changes of the eastern sandbar collapsing and the western sandbar rising are truly like the changes of the sea. Outside Zhangjiagang Port in the eastern suburbs, there is a place called Shuangshan Sandbar, which is more than ten li long and six or seven li wide. There are more than 500 households, with bamboo fences and thatched houses, and it has the flavor of "a rooster's crow, a thatched cottage, a moon, footprints on a plank bridge, and frost." It is still like a peach blossom garden outside the world. This sandbar was formed eighteen years ago when the river water carried silt and was blocked by the feet of the Chang and Wu mountains, accumulating into a beach. It has been accumulating for the past ten years, hence the name Shuangshan Sandbar. It has only been reclaimed for twenty-eight years. When they first came to cultivate the land, they saw that the

Mud was little and black so they named it Tiebansha [Iron Board Sand]. Looking at the sandbar from across the river in Jiangnan, the sandbar in the river looks like a large black fish, so it is also called Heiyusha [Black Fish Sand]. In the 18th year of the Republic of China [1929], gentry Wu Tinglu and others raised funds and organized workers to build embankments. Here, men, women, old and young, mostly have the idea of "not knowing Wei and Jin, let alone Han." They are all dressed in homemade cloth made in Du, without permed women or men wearing leather shoes. They eat simple meals and do not ask about world affairs. They only know to work at sunrise and rest at sunset, sing songs while hitting the earth, dig ponds to drink, and till the fields for food. All day long, they are carefree and enjoy the peace of rural life.

All the houses on the sandbar are only six tile-roofed houses in the Lengtan of the Lu Liubao and Lu Yunbao brothers. The rest are all thatched houses. The

Land tax paid is very light which is of a reed nature. Each mu [Chinese acre] is only two he [Chinese pint] of rice. There are more than 10,000 mu of land, and the price is very cheap. Each mu is worth five shi [Chinese bushel] of rice. Two types of indica rice and soybeans are planted in the fields, and each has an output of three to four thousand shi each year. Secondly, cotton, peaches, and grains also have a very winter yield. Winter wheat, broad beans, and peas do not need to be fertilized and have a very good yield. There are livestock such as sheep, pigs, and cattle, as well as a small machine oil press and two soil oil presses. Women can push them and move freely. Men and women have equal work.

Cultural level is very low. Only Yu Qixian, a sandbar resident, has just graduated from middle school. There is not a single other middle school student. There is a national primary school in Bao, with more than 240 school-age children, but only 40 are in school. There is also a private school, with four students. It has recently been merged with the Bao school.

Not long ago, County Magistrate Xu went to inspect and merged the ninety-er bao into a self-governing experimental bao and organized a self-defense force. In addition to adding rifles, they used local soil cannons, bird guns, wooden sticks, and broadswords, with a gong for each jia [unit of area] for alarms, and implemented mutual assistance. In addition,

Building new streets, the city houses are built like bunkers, with rivers running around them. Local politics, culture, economy, and military are all concentrated together. In addition to the regular bao chief, there are two deputy bao chiefs. A self-defense force has one deputy team leader, and a farmers' association and a fish farming cooperative are also organized to control the reeds along the river. In addition to the residents' own use, most of the reeds are transported to other places by boat for sale to help production. The above plans are now being implemented in order.

### Raising Funds to Fill Private Pockets Zhang Wenxi's Reputation Bankrupt Committed Suicide by Drinking Arsenic

[Our Suzhou Dispatch on the 23rd] Zhang Wenxi, a teacher at the private Shouzhen Primary School in the city, recently raised funds for the school but embezzled them for his own use. Because he was warned by the school in the newspaper, he felt that his reputation was bankrupt. He committed suicide by drinking arsenic in the morning of the 21st. He was treated but was not effective and died that night. The police station is currently investigating the corpse's family.

### Water Tobacco Export Trade Ranks First Three Hundred Thousand People Depend on it for a Living

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch on the 20th] Gansu's water tobacco has been famous throughout the country for a long time. Its heyday was as far back as the Guangxu period of the late Qing Dynasty and around the 10th year of the Republic of China [1921]. It not only ranked first in Gansu's foreign trade economically (followed by fur and then medicinal materials), but also in the national fiscal revenue, it was an important source of tax revenue among national taxes. In the past decade, it has suffered from the devastation of war, the popularity of cigarettes and cigars, and the impact of imitation planting and learning in other provinces (such as Quwo, Shanxi), forming the current state of decline. But it still has its market. In addition to the common people in various parts of the Northwest, who still buy and smoke water tobacco because it is cheaper than cigarettes and cigars (i.e., homemade cigars), before the "September 18th" Incident [1931], it could be sold far to the Northeast, Yantai, Pingjin [Beijing and Tianjin], Shanxi, Suiyuan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hunan, and even various parts of Southeast Asia. After the war, due to various obstacles (such as insufficient capital and blocked transportation), sales have declined day by day. After all, it can still be sold to Xinjiang, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Ningxia, Qinghai, Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, etc. Even the sales volume in Shanghai alone last year (the 35th year of the Republic of China [1946]) reached 2,335,705 catties. Although it cannot be compared with the quantity of imported foreign tobacco, its excellent conditions for existence are clearly visible.

Water tobacco is made from tobacco leaves. The tobacco leaf is commonly known as nine-leaf rue grass. It is said that after Zhuge Liang conquered the southern barbarians, during

Six Expeditions to Qishan he introduced this grass to the north into Gansu. According to "Jinhu Qimo": "During the Qianlong period, Lanzhou produced tobacco seeds and used lead and copper as pipes to store water and smoke it." The so-called "pipe" is commonly known as a water tobacco pouch. The most famous are made of Guangdong silver. Noble families have silver ones, and poor people make them of bamboo and smoke them in the same way. The taste of the water leaf tobacco is sweet, mellow, fragrant, and moist, which is very different from cigarettes and cigars.

Due to Gansu's high altitude, low rainfall, and cold weather, tobacco leaf production areas are mostly distributed in the valleys on both sides of the river, with the Lanzhou area in the Yellow River basin and the Lintao area in the Tao River basin as the main production areas. The production area in each area depends on the tobacco leaf price and sales situation in previous years. In the 25th year of the Republic of China [1936], the tobacco leaf cultivation area was 42,000 mu, and the harvest was 3,546,000 catties. In the 30th year [1941], due to the small import of foreign tobacco, it reached 46,358 mu, and the harvest was 9,886,482 catties. Later, it declined year by year. Last year, it was only 40,065 mu, and the harvest was 7,017,938 catties. The above figures are only for the Lanzhou area (including Lanzhou, Gaolan, Yuzhong, Jingyuan, and other counties and cities), the tobacco production center, because data from other counties is difficult to obtain. It is enough to illustrate the trend of the tobacco industry's decline. If the tobacco production of the entire province is estimated, it is at least 80,000 catties or more, and the finished product is about 11 million catties.

Tobacco leaf varieties belong to the yellow flower species. The green tobacco, yellow tobacco, and cotton tobacco that are commonly referred to are only different in the harvest period and the raw materials used. Under normal circumstances, after the spring wheat is harvested, the empty space is used for sowing. Wait until it grows to before the frost falls in the lunar calendar, and pull it down and put it in the warehouse. This is called green leaves and is used to make green tobacco silk. If the leaves turn yellow due to frost and then are cut down and put in the warehouse, it is called yellow leaves and is used to make yellow cotton tobacco silk. The yellow leaves that turn dark yellow due to the influence of climate and pests are used for making hemp tobacco silk and dry tobacco. The quality of tobacco leaves is greatly related to the components they contain. According to the test results, the usual tobacco leaf components contain 15% to 30% protein, 10% to 20% ash, 1% to 6% nicotine, 8% to 10% fiber, 2% to 8% acids, 1% ammonia, and 25% to 63% water. Except for protein, fiber, and water, which are neutral, the rest, such as acids, bases, and ash, have special properties. Smoking can avoid epidemics, aid digestion, kill insects, and relieve boredom. Avoiding epidemics is especially important. Those who live in high mountains, dense forests, and humid lands will almost lose their lives if they do not smoke.

Water tobacco processing begins after the tobacco leaves enter the workshop. The procedures are:

Grading Remove the main veins of the leaves, and then sort and dry each leaf one by one according to the size, color, thickness, and integrity. This work is commonly known as tearing tobacco leaves, and female workers and child labor are mostly hired temporarily.

Mixing ingredients Put the tobacco leaves into the mixing room, first spray them with boiling water, and then add the ingredients one by one. Green tobacco is mixed with gypsum, pagoda tree flowers, purple flowers, stone alkali, alum, and vegetable oil. For yellow tobacco, first spray and stir the vegetable oil evenly, and then sprinkle in turmeric powder (for dyeing), salt (for preservation), and various spices such as angelica, sweet grass, mint, chuanxiong, and atractylodes, and some also add precious borneol. Xiang...etc., mix well after mixing.

Pressing and bundling Put the tobacco leaves that have been mixed with the ingredients into a specially prepared rectangular solid trough made of wood, and use manual bare feet to press them into bundles of rough embryos, then use wooden boards to clip them out, cut them into three sections, and place them on a high-pressure platform, using the principle of leverage and the method of attaching weights to pulleys to press the tobacco bundles heavily until they become a whole and can be cut into silk. This kind of high pressure usually reaches a weight of 700,000 catties.

Cutting silk After the tobacco bundles are pressed, they are cut into silk with a specially made planing knife held by two people facing each other at both ends of the tobacco bundles, each bundle weighing 1,000 catties. The tobacco silk cut out is pressed into a hardwood box that can hold one or two taels or four taels, forming silk blocks (commonly known as bundles).

Air-drying After weighing each tobacco silk block, they are put on the shelf for air-drying to allow the moisture in the tobacco block to slowly evaporate. This process takes about one to two months.

Sealing and packaging After the tobacco blocks are air-dried, they are grouped, sealed with paper, and placed in boxes one by one. Each green tobacco block weighs about two taels, ten blocks per package, 320 packages per box, two boxes per dan [Chinese unit of weight], each dan weighs about 440 catties. Each yellow tobacco block weighs about four taels, ten blocks per package, 72 packages per box, four boxes per dan, each dan weighs about 700 catties.

Hemp tobacco, also known as dry tobacco, is made from the scraps and remaining stems left over from making green and yellow tobacco, with a small amount of spices added. It is mostly sold to the working class for smoking, and its smoke tastes spicy and intense.

In the early years of the Republic of China, there were more than 100 tobacco workshops in Lanzhou and more than 150 in Lintao. According to a survey at the end of last year, there were no more than 48 in Lanzhou and only 67 in Lintao. Comparing the annual decline, it is nothing less than a history of the decline of the tobacco industry. Gansu Province, located in the northwest corner of the country, does not have developed transportation, and its production, management methods, and sales methods adhere to the old rules. Moreover, the production cost has increased, the capital turnover is not flexible, and there is no way to improve. The loss of the tobacco industry during the war: from the 27th to the 33rd year of the Republic of China [1938-1944], 1,149,885 catties were mildewed due to the inability to transport them out. In the 29th year [1940], 400 boxes, more than 80,000 catties, were bombed and destroyed by Japanese planes near Zhennanguan while attempting to export through Hanoi, Vietnam. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, 1,600 boxes, 352,000 catties, were confiscated by the Japanese puppet government in Shanghai. When Hong Kong was captured, more than 600 boxes, 32,000 catties, were lost in shipwrecks. After the victory, 763 boxes, 87,745 catties, were submerged by the surge of the Wei River when they were first concentrated in Xianyang waiting for transport to the east. On August 9th last year, 1,799 boxes, weighing 206,885 catties, were burned by the Communists at Dangshan Station. This is still the case for those who have obtained proof of tax payment. Other direct and indirect losses are even more difficult to count. From tobacco leaf

Seedling cultivation in Gansu Province to the completion of finished tobacco silk, it is estimated that at least 300,000 people directly and indirectly depend on it for a living. In Lanzhou City alone, there are at least 50,000 people. If this important economic undertaking is allowed to decline day by day, leading to withering and bankruptcy, this cannot but make people wake up! And we must urgently seek ways to rescue it! Therefore, no matter the central or local government, no matter the agricultural, financial, social, fiscal, transportation and other agencies, they should all find ways to assist the survival, development, promotion, and restoration of Gansu's only economic undertaking, and jointly seek the bright future of the national economy.

### Birth of the Fudan Cooperative Department; Following the Legacy Advocated by Mr. Xue Xianzhou, Unveiling a New Page in China's Cooperative Movement

When mentioning the cooperative movement in China, people will immediately think of Mr. Xue Xianzhou, the father of Chinese cooperation. Thirty years ago, when the flower of the cooperative movement was blooming all over the world, China was still a desert of cooperation. It was not until the May Fourth Movement in 1919 that the tide of democracy washed over this ancient continent. The insightful Mr. Xue Xianzhou, in order to cooperate with the establishment of a democratic economy, took the lead in advocating the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal cooperative movement in China. Thus, the first cooperative bank in China was established at Fudan University in Jiangwan, Shanghai, which was the Shanghai National Cooperative Savings Bank, with the longest history and the most successful operation. Mr. Xue, on the one hand, used the opportunity of teaching to instill cooperative ideas and knowledge into students, and on the other hand, founded the "Common People Weekly" (later renamed "Common People Society") to promote the cooperative movement and advocate the spirit of cooperation, gradually expanding the cooperative movement from intellectuals to the working masses. At that time, many Fudan students were inspired and enlightened by Mr. Xue and devoted themselves to the cooperative movement. Today, many pioneers in the domestic cooperative sector, such as Wang Shiying, Chen Zhongming, and Wen Chongxin, have all benefited from Mr. Xue's teachings. They followed Mr. Xue's path and worked hard for the cooperative cause in China. In less than a generation, they had transformed the cooperative movement in China from its infancy to its development stage, from urban areas to rural areas, completing the arduous foundational work for the cooperative road in China, which is worthy of admiration.

Concrete Manifestation of Traditional Spirit

The reason why the cooperative movement in China was born at Fudan, in addition to the aforementioned advocacy of Mr. Xue Xianzhou, also has other historical factors: Fudan's innate nature carries a very strong traditional spirit of "mutual assistance" and "sacrifice." "Fudan is a big family," which has been repeatedly emphasized by the late President Li Denghui and the current President Zhang Yi, and the principle of cooperation is the combination of people, the chain of love, and the cooperative society is like a big family, which coincides with the "Fudan Spirit." In addition, cooperation is an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic movement, and Fudan, facing the division of the motherland by warlords and the invasion of imperialists, has always stood on the front line of battle, which is a concrete manifestation of the spirit of "mutual assistance" and "sacrifice." Therefore, Fudan's ability to become the cradle of the cooperative movement in China is not accidental, but has its innate factors and historical background.

In the past, Fudan has cultivated many outstanding cooperative talents for the country, and now it continues to shoulder the sacred task of cultivating talents. In the autumn of last year (1947), Fudan established the Department of Cooperation, which is still a rare department in domestic universities. The head of this department is Mr. Chen Zhongming, who, more than twenty years ago, during his student days, founded the Fudan Common People Volunteer School. Since stepping out of Fudan's gates, Mr. Chen has always adhered to the cooperative position. Many years of work experience have given him a very optimistic belief in the future of Chinese cooperation. From his amiable attitude, it is not difficult to deduce the successful elements of running civil education in those years.

Research Theory Combined with Practice

Currently, there are a total of sixty-six students in the entire Department of Cooperation. Although the number of people is not large, they all entered victoriously after a difficult entrance examination. The most valuable thing is the harmonious relationship and serious learning among the students, which, from the perspective of outsiders, is unmatched by other departments in the school. In terms of research, they have a department-wide cooperative society, which regularly publishes academic wall newspapers to allow students to openly discuss cooperative issues. At the same time, they also organized a cooperative economic reading club, using extracurricular time to collectively read and discuss, gradually exploring from the most basic to the more advanced, combining theory with practice. In addition, they are preparing to establish a cooperative library. In addition to the department purchasing a portion of books, they are also asking pioneers in the cooperative sector to donate. Mr. Wu Yuzhang, a veteran of the cooperative sector in Sichuan, has generously donated a portion of his library, about nearly ten thousand volumes, which will be shipped to the school. After the school allocates a building, the library of the Department of Cooperation will be opened. In order to commemorate the cooperative tutor Mr. Xue Xianzhou, the school specially named the library "Xianzhou Hall" on the 55th Alumni Day this year (see photo), so that students can face this great building and suddenly feel respectful thoughts.

Field Investigation to Discover New Knowledge

Because cooperation is a practical science, students in the Department of Cooperation cannot only search through books. They must experience reality and investigate the current situation in order to improve and develop in the future. Therefore, Mr. Chen Zhongming used this year's summer vacation to introduce them to various cooperatives in Nanjing, Hangzhou, Taiwan, Suzhou, and this city for internships, so that they could verify the knowledge in books through internships and understand the characteristics of the cooperative movement in China. Students are particularly satisfied with the faculty lineup. In addition to Chen Zhongming as the department head, there are also Wang Shiying, Luo Qianying, Huang Zhaoxing, Tang Xunze and others as professors. Mr. Luo Qianying is the editor-in-chief of the "Cooperative Economics Monthly." He is enthusiastic and brave, has more than twenty years of experience in the cooperative movement, and has a wealth of cooperative writings. He hopes that a complete set of cooperative theory and a new school of cooperation can be produced at Fudan. Mr. Wang Shiying, who has a long-standing reputation in the cooperative sector, teaches advanced cooperative economics here. Mr. Huang Zhaoxing teaches agricultural cooperation. Like Mr. Chen Zhongming, he has visited cooperative enterprises in various European countries and has profound research on agricultural cooperation. These professors are very close to the students, so students dare to discuss various cooperative issues without any concerns. Indeed, the Department of Cooperation is still a newborn at Fudan, but the teachers and students of the Department of Cooperation have a common ideal, that is, they all hope that this child, who has been conceived for thirty years and only recently born, will become stronger and stronger in suffering, like the young motherland.

Undoubtedly, in order to promote the realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood, the cooperative enterprise has shouldered the important task of national economic construction today. In the past, Fudan has made glorious contributions to the growth of the cooperative movement in China, but for decades, the cooperative movement has not been universally developed, the cooperative ideology has not been deeply rooted in the people, and a complete cooperative theory suitable for the national conditions has not been established. Therefore, in order to accompany the progress of history, in order to make the cooperative movement develop actively and steadily, based on the Three Principles of the People and based on the philosophy of people's livelihood, to establish a set of practical and immortal cooperative theory, should be the new mission of the Fudan Cooperative Department in the future.

All the players arrived late, and the match started at 2:45 PM. Referee He Chunhui, the Blue team attacked first.

The White team counterattacked but found no openings. Until five minutes before the end of the first half, the Blue team attacked again.

Two minutes later, Xu Erz of the White team committed a foul in the penalty area, and Sun Jinshun failed to score the penalty kick. The first half ended with the Blue team leading 2-0.

### Lineup Changes in the Second Half

After the break, there were changes in the lineups of both the Blue and White teams. Robert Stoff and Li [name] of the Blue team switched with Han Longhai and Jin Lusheng of the White team.

Just as they were planning to raise the banner again, Longhai of the Blue team also launched a light cavalry attack, scoring a sneaky goal, making it 3-1. At 34 minutes, Jin Lusheng left the field due to injury. As the match approached the final stage, neither side scored any more goals. As a result, the Blue team defeated the White team 3-1, completing the final selection battle.

### Tianjin Area Selection Tournament for the World Games Basketball Competition Begins

### Badminton First Division Competition: Zhonghua Defeats John

Zhonghua defeated John 6-3 yesterday. The Badminton League First Division Championship will be retained by Zhonghua because Zhonghua's total score exceeds John's by as many as nine points. John will have a match against Tiyun. If John wins Tiyun 9-0, their score will be equal to Zhonghua's. However, weighing the strength, it seems unlikely that John will have a complete victory of nine points. Therefore, the championship will belong to Zhonghua. The results of yesterday's finals are as follows:

Basketball Committee Replies to Seoul Team, Hoping They Can Come to Shanghai During Lunar New Year

The Seoul Basketball Team of Korea recently telegraphed the Municipal Basketball Committee, intending to travel south for an expedition at the end of the month. The Basketball Committee convened a meeting to discuss and decided to welcome the team to Shanghai, but hoped that they could change the departure to after February 10th. There are two reasons: 1. Due to the scheduled program of the basketball league, it is inconvenient to change it, and the venue is a major problem. After February 10th, there will be no such difficulties. 2. The end of this month coincides with the end of the Lunar New Year, and after February 10th coincides with the Lunar New Year period, which will be more convenient. The Basketball Committee has telegraphed the above two points to the team a few days ago, and also asked the Associated Press to contact them.

### Minister Yu Returns to Nanjing After Discussing Matters in Shanghai; Comprehensive Rice Rationing Scheduled to Be Implemented; Mayor Wu Will Serve as Chairman of the People's Food Allocation Committee

[Our Newspaper] Regarding the matter of comprehensive rice rationing in this city, Minister Yu [name] of the Ministry of Food arrived in Shanghai and, after consultation with Director Wu [name] of the Bureau of Social Affairs, it has been decided to implement it starting in March. However, the original plan was for the government to ration one dou (a unit of dry volume, approx. 10 liters) per person per month and allow the purchase of one dou. Now, the Ministry of Food, based on research by foreign experts in various aspects such as nutrition, believes that one and a half dou per person per month is enough for the Chinese people's rice consumption. After consideration, it will be stipulated that each person will receive 1.8 sheng (a unit of dry volume, 1 sheng = 0.1 dou) per month. Among them, 0.8 sheng will be rationed by the government, and one dou will be allowed to be purchased from the market. The price of government-rationed rice is prepared to be calculated at 60% of the market price, which is still awaiting a formal decision by the Executive Yuan. Regarding the issue of expanding and reorganizing the Municipal People's Food Allocation Committee, Minister Yu and Director Wu decided after consultation that Mayor Wu will serve as the chairman and Director Wu will serve as the vice-chairman. However, because both are busy with government affairs and have no time to take care of it, another vice-chairman will be appointed to take actual responsibility. The reorganization will be implemented after the official order from the Executive Yuan arrives, and the date is expected to be in mid-February.

Another report: According to people in the rice industry, the recent surge in rice prices was completely caused by the poor transportation due to the snow and wind. If the weather clears and the transportation is smooth, the rice market can be leveled. According to relevant parties, the implementation of household rice rationing is scheduled to begin in early March. All rationed rice has been prepared, and rice and flour from American relief supplies are also being transported to China one after another. Therefore, the supply of rice in this city can be said to be worry-free.

### After Inspecting Industrial and Mining Construction Enterprises, Weng Wenhao Returns to Shanghai from Guangdong; Resource Committee Cooperates with Guangdong Provincial Government to Develop Resources

[Our Newspaper] Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the Resource Committee, and Secretary-General Wu Zhaohong and others, were invited by Song Wenshi, Chairman of Guangdong Province, to go to Guangdong to inspect industrial and mining construction enterprises and plan the development of industry in the province. They have completed their official business and flew to Shanghai from Guangdong at 3:00 PM yesterday.

It is reported that the results of Weng's trip were quite satisfactory. It is said that the Resource Committee has decided to cooperate with the Guangdong Provincial Government to cultivate and develop the following three items: 1. Explore new coal mines in Guangdong Province to provide a sufficient supply of fuel for the province. 2. Develop sugar cane production and add modern sugar factories, planning to transfer some sugar factories from Taiwan to Guangdong as much as possible. 3. Develop hydropower as much as possible in Guangdong Province to fully supply the power needed to develop Guangdong Province's industry.

During their stay in Guangdong, Weng and others conducted extensive inspections and investigations in three areas and conducted detailed research and discussions with the Guangdong Provincial Government, which has resulted in concrete plans. After arriving in Shanghai yesterday, Weng and others held talks with the Central Bank and other related parties. The issue of allocating funds for the development of Guangdong Province's industry was discussed in detail.

Weng and others are scheduled to take the train to Nanjing tonight to report the results of this trip to the central authorities and ask for further guidance.

### Flour Reporting for Transshipment - No Permit Fee Regulations

[Report from our Newspaper] According to a statement from the Ministry of Food: A five-member petition delegation consisting of the speakers of the Hebei-Tianjin Provisional Assembly, and representatives from industrial and commercial circles, reported to Minister Yu that for each bag of flour shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin, a permit fee of 150,000 yuan was required. Minister Yu attached great importance to this illegal demand and, in addition to answering the petitioners face-to-face and requesting them to provide as much evidence as possible, has also dispatched Inspector Chen Kai, Supervisory Committee Member Xu Gongrang, and Section Chief Li Cheng to be responsible for a thorough investigation. According to the regulations, flour produced by flour mills in various provinces and cities in the Jiangnan region and reported for transshipment is subject to a quota verified by the Ministry of Land and Food and released by the customs, without any permit fees.

### Cigarette Market Turns from Weak to Strong

The cigarette market yesterday started off flat, but as small investors sold off profits, and Yizhong's out-of-town branches dumped inventory on the market, the market showed a weak trend. However, by noon closing, due to strengthened sentiment among major dealers, various parties came to buy, and prices rose again. As a result, a pack of ten Great Britain cigarettes rose by 200,000 yuan compared to the previous day, reaching 34,452,000 yuan. Old Knife cigarettes increased by 250,000 yuan, to 28,000,001 yuan. Hade Gate also rose by 250,000 yuan, while other brands went up by 500 to 1,200 yuan per carton. Canned cigarettes of brands such as Crik, 35克, and Laiwen remained weak.

Also, it is reported that Yizhong Company's Great Britain cigarette price list has been adjusted, with a pack of 20 cigarettes increasing to 34,000,000 yuan and a pack of 10 cigarettes increasing to 33,000,000 yuan, both representing an increase of 3,000,000 yuan compared to the previous price list.

### Detailed Rules for Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management to Be Implemented Soon

The implementation rules for various aspects of cotton yarn and cloth management, including commissioned spinning, commissioned weaving, unified purchasing, and unified sales, drafted by the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, have been reviewed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs but still need to be finalized. Therefore, the heads of the three departments of the committee, namely the Business Department and the Technical Department, met yesterday to finalize the rules, and Fei Mingyang, the director of the Control Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, took them to Beijing yesterday for final approval. It is said that there are a total of seven implementation rules, which the Ministry of Economic Affairs should approve and send to Shanghai within two or three days, and they can be announced and implemented within this week.

In addition, the indoor courses for the committee's yarn mill specialist training have been completed last week. Starting today, trainees will be assigned to various spinning mills for a week of practical training. Next week, they will be assigned to work in various yarn mills in conjunction with the implementation rules.

### Oil Industry Expresses Opposition to Diesel Fuel Allocation Method

Recently, the association handled the registration of diesel raw materials, stipulating that diesel fuel allocation to factories would only be granted to those with licenses from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. All oil refining factories in the city, except for Yongda and Tongming, do not meet the qualifications. The association believes that some member factories have already obtained factory registration certificates from the Bureau of Social Affairs and are in the process of submitting them to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for factory registration. Therefore, it raised objections to the Petroleum Transportation Control Commission's (輸管會) diesel allocation method and requested the committee to re-examine it.

It is said that regarding the registration of various oil refining factories with the Petroleum Transportation Control Commission's diesel allocation office according to the factory registration method, the industry believes that it should be based on the forms filled out by each factory, and the association should report them to facilitate management and prevent abuses. Regarding the standards for qualified registration, which require registration with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and continuous operation, the industry requests that the registration standards should be handled in accordance with Article 5, Section 2 of the "Application Registration and Supply Method for Diesel and Fuel Oil Users," and that companies that have obtained receipts for registration with the Ministry of Economic Affairs should be allowed to be eligible for allocation. The industry association has decided to argue with the Petroleum Transportation Control Commission on the basis of reason.

### Hong Kong's Industrial Climate Is Thriving - Factory Registration Applications Are Close to Pre-War Numbers

Hong Kong News: Although Hong Kong factories and their machinery suffered losses of up to 80% during the war, and despite soaring construction materials and wages after the war, Hong Kong's industry has made considerable progress in the past two years. The speed of its recovery is truly astonishing. The current productivity of Hong Kong has almost reached 70% of the pre-war level. If the current rate of recovery continues for the next two years, the productivity of Hong Kong's new and old industries will exceed any pre-war year.

Almost all of Hong Kong's pre-war factories have been completely or partially rebuilt, and many new factories have either started production or are under development. Since the war, 1,297 factories have been registered in Hong Kong, of which 112 have been closed. There are currently 1,185 factories in operation. In the past few months, 883 factories have been accepted for registration by the Hong Kong Labour Department, while others are still under investigation. More applications are being submitted to the Labour Department every day, requesting registration, and it is believed that the number of registered factories in Hong Kong will soon exceed the pre-war record of 1,200.

The largest of Hong Kong's new industries is the textile industry. Shanghai industrialists found it difficult to work in Shanghai, so they moved their factories south to Hong Kong. Weaving and knitting industries are also developing. Japanese weaving was Hong Kong's main competitor before the war. If Japanese goods are unable to rise again in the next few years, the future of Hong Kong's weaving industry is unlimited and may increase production by up to 200%.

As for the establishment of heavy industry, it is very likely that copper and iron factories, copper smelting plants, and small shipyards will be opened this year. In 1947, Hong Kong's shipyards were all busy and had received orders that would support their work for several months without stopping. New orders and requests for ship repairs are also coming in steadily, so there is no shortage of work. It is believed that more industrial institutions and new industries may be launched this year.

### Soap Prices Rise

The soap market for daily necessities is experiencing strong demand from all parties due to urgent replenishment by industry players. There are rumors that the Huang Xiangmao factory price has increased to over 1.2 million yuan per case, which has further boosted market sentiment and buying interest, leading to a steady rise in prices. As a result, Guben soap was listed at 1.79 million yuan, an increase of 15,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Arrow Knife soap increased by 10,000 yuan, to 1.75 million yuan. Huang Xiangmao increased by 20,000 yuan, while Guang Sheng and Henry also increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.

Furthermore, after the noon closing, although off-market transactions were scarce, asking prices continued to rise. Guben soap was priced as high as 1.8 million yuan before it could be bought, Huang Xiangmao rose to 1.265 million yuan, and other soaps were also more expensive than the prices inside.

### Repayment of Pre-War Deposits and Loans to Begin on January 27

[Report from our Newspaper] The regulations on the repayment of pre-war deposits and loans in the banking industry were promulgated by the National Government on December 26th of last year. In order to ensure uniform calculation methods, the Shanghai Banking, Money Exchange, and Trust Association entrusted the Banking Society to formulate the "Uniform Handling Method for Pre-War Deposits and Loans in the Banking Industry." In addition to reporting this method to the Ministry of Finance for record and notifying all members to comply with it, it is now learned that the association has formally announced that repayment will begin on January 27th of this year, in accordance with Article 7 of the repayment regulations. Pre-war depositors and borrowers can quickly go to the relevant banks, money exchanges, and companies to complete the repayment procedures.

### Small-Scale Loan Syndicate for Money Exchanges to Be Established Soon

[Report from our Newspaper] The preparation of a small-scale credit loan syndicate formed by 76 money exchanges in the city has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the syndicate's basic capital has reached 4.95 billion yuan. A management committee has been established to manage the syndicate's affairs, with Mr. Shen Rixin elected as the chairman and Zou Rangqing, Pei Jiande, and Lu Shuchen appointed as directors of various groups. Hong Jingshan, who has worked at the Zhuzai Commercial Reclamation Bank for many years, has been hired as the director of the loan department. Accountants and investigators have been appointed to handle affairs. The syndicate's address is located downstairs in the Ningbo Road Money Exchange Association, and it will soon be announced established and begin operations. It is reported that the target of the syndicate's loans is small-scale industry and commerce in the city, with the amount of each loan temporarily set at 2 million to 6 million yuan, with a monthly interest rate of 6%, and a maximum term of three months, with interest and principal repaid monthly. Borrowers can request introductions from various syndicate member money exchanges, and after the exchanges conduct preliminary investigations, they will be sent to the syndicate for approval.

Although the match trade is not hot, asking prices for brands such as Meili, Fenghuang, and Nanjing have increased by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan, while miscellaneous brands are weaker. The kerosene and candle market remains stable.

### Potassium Chlorate, etc., Direct Allocation to Manufacturers Under Consideration by the Petroleum Transportation Control Commission

The Export-Import Management Committee is currently considering allowing the import of two chemical industrial raw materials, "phosphorus" and "potassium chlorate," which are most needed by the match industry. In the past, after these raw materials were imported, they were often allocated by the Petroleum Transportation Control Commission to importers, who then distributed them to various manufacturers in the industry. The industry believes that this places an excessive burden on them, so it has requested the committee to directly allocate the raw materials to the industry's manufacturers in the future. The Petroleum Transportation Control Commission has agreed to consider this proposal and is currently convening representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association to discuss it.

### Sichuan Province Develops Special Products - Provincial Government Formulates Three Major Plans

[Report from our Newspaper in Chengdu] In order to develop Sichuan's export trade, the Sichuan Provincial Government has expanded the production and marketing of special products this year, and its planned projects include: Developing tung oil cultivation, completing 50,000 mu in Wanzhou, Fengjie, Yunyang, Wushan, and other counties this year, and organizing tung oil production cooperatives. A wool washing and pressing factory will be established in Guanxian, a joint venture between the government and merchants, using scientific methods to refine the wool produced in Songpan and sell it abroad. A large-scale pig bristle factory will be established in Longchang to refine pig bristles for export. The plan has now been approved and will be implemented immediately.

[Report from our Newspaper in Chengdu] The Sichuan Construction Department has formulated plans to develop and increase the production of Sichuan's export specialty products. Statistics for the 36th year show the production increase and sales situation: Black pig bristles: annual production of 1,000 dan; White pig bristles: annual production of 5,300 guan; Reed mats: annual production of 400 million pieces. All of the above are export goods, sold to the UK and the Soviet Union. Cowhide: annual production of 12,000 dan, 50% sold to Shanghai and Hankou, and the remaining 50% sold elsewhere. Sheepskin: annual production of 15,000 dan, 30% sold to Shanghai, and 70% sold to the UK and the US. Gallnuts: annual production of 20,000 dan, 60% sold to Shanghai, and the remaining 40% sold elsewhere.

### Difficult Exports and Rising Costs - The Future of the Fujian Tea Industry Is Bleak

[Report from our Newspaper in Fuzhou] The tea market in Fuzhou, which has always been a major tea market in our country, has recently been affected by drastic price fluctuations, rising production costs, and stagnant exports. Tea merchants from various places who used to travel back and forth to buy and sell are now mostly taking a wait-and-see approach, and the lively scene of spring has now faded away. According to the local market conditions, the price of Tuen green tea has recently been above 2.4 million yuan per dan, which is roughly the same as that of Zhenmei Chongxin. Zhenmei is also above 2.3 million yuan. Ping Shui green tea has been reduced in price to 1.6 million yuan. High-quality black tea, such as Chong'an Xiaozhong, has reached over 3.5 million yuan, while medium and low grades are also in the range of 1.8 million to 2.4 million yuan. Mao tea is priced at 1.3 million yuan, and fried green tea is priced at 1.2 million yuan. These transaction prices have placed a great burden on tea merchants, as the overseas market is increasingly weak. It is said that the highest price for British black tea is 4 shillings and 10 pence per pound, while in the United States it is between 23 cents and 32 cents per pound, and North African green tea is equivalent to 70 cents to 1 US dollar. With the current export prices, plus packaging and shipping costs, each 50 kilograms is over 3 million yuan. In comparison, tea merchants can only sigh and look to the ocean. In August of last year, when the exchange rate was first adjusted, the export volume reached over 10,000 dan per month. In September, it was reduced to half that amount, and in October, it was only 4,000 dan. As for after November, there has been no improvement.

### New Advances in Radioactive Isotope Research

— Yang Shi

Radioactive isotopes are powerful tools in both scientific research and medicine, but until recently, obtaining them was very expensive. Producing even small quantities from a cyclotron was frustrating, and the cost was considerable. Introducing radioactive carbon minerals worth fifty US dollars into a cyclotron and spending another million US dollars would only yield a small amount of radioactive isotopes. Now, a new method has been invented that allows artificial radioactive isotopes to be produced in large quantities. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory can now use chain fission to obtain what laymen call "artificial radium" from uranium piles. It not only supplies every advanced laboratory and hospital with unlimited applications for "treatment", but it can also be exported to countries around the world at a high price. This is a major step forward in the research of radioactive isotopes.

In medicine, the rays of radioactive isotopes can have miraculous effects in treating diseases. Whether injected into a vein or an organ, or even placed in a tasteless solution for the patient to swallow, these radium-like elements can accurately target the injured area, destroy pathogens, and heal the injury. Since the invention of the microscope, they have been a powerful tool in academic research. They can serve as a "detective" for physiologists, mixing with certain foods and entering the human body to reveal the physiological reactions that scientists want to know. In engineering, especially chemical analysis, they are indispensable tools.

Large-scale production at Oak Ridge is achieved by neutrons from fission impacting the pile, producing many radioactive isotopes. Over sixty elements can produce ninety types of isotopes. The 27-inch diameter cyclotron at the Yale University Physics Laboratory can also produce many very short-lived isotopes.

The Yale University Physics Laboratory, one of the American physical research centers, is conducting large-scale experiments with this new method of artificially creating radium. Countless planes and trains transport minerals to this laboratory. Leading this great research effort is Dr. Ernest Pollard, a pioneer in nuclear physics. Now, I can introduce the academic research help of these radioactive isotopes separately.

Phosphorus exists in nature, such as in phosphate rock. Artificial radioactive phosphorus can be made into a vaccine to prevent the activity of dysentery bacteria and injected into animals. For example, it can be mixed into nutrients and injected into the body, and a Geiger counter can be used to accurately check the location of the injury. If injected into chicken eggs, radioactive phosphorus becomes a germ incubator, causing the eggs to produce influenza viruses. If injected into pollen, it can cause mutation.

Due to the high affinity between iodine and the thyroid gland, radioactive iodine can be used as a powerful tool to treat the thyroid. When toxins move from the thyroid gland to a part of the human body, a dose of radioactive iodine and a Basin counter can immediately find the location of the poisoning, and then increase the amount of iodine to destroy the toxins and eliminate them forever. Because of this, radioactive iodine will save countless people.

Radioactive manganese has also solved many difficult problems for zoologists. For example, wasps and clams have no affinity in animal classification, but their bodies contain forty times more manganese than other animals. Why is this? The answer is radioactive manganese.

The short lifespan of many radioactive isotopes is surprising. Using this subtle relationship is of great help to the study of atomic nuclei. The US Naval Research Office has funded Dr. Pollard to continue his new explorations because of its importance. He invented a "slow clock" specifically to measure the lifespan of these radioactive isotopes. Radioactive neon produced by a cyclotron is measured by an electromagnetic lens to determine the energy of the rays, which determines that its lifespan is only forty seconds. The lifespan of radioactive nitrogen is only two hours.

From Professor Bertram Boltwood of Yale University discovered the first isotope (Ionium, slightly lighter than thorium) in 1906 to now, scientists have discovered more than 670 isotopes, of which more than 270 are fixed, such as heavy gas in water (twice as heavy as gas), and ten isotopes of tin that can be found in ordinary minerals. The rest are radioactive isotopes, their lifespans ranging from one millionth of a second to almost tens of millions of years. Most of them are artificially created, and as mentioned before, the small output means that scientists know that it is an extremely helpful tool for research, but cannot obtain large quantities to carry out their work. Now that they can be produced in large quantities, what they bring to scientific researchers will undoubtedly be a series of rapid advances.

### Food Substitutes for Rice

— Ke Zhi

After the end of this World War, the whole world is facing a famine. It is said that for several years, people in Europe generally lacked protein in their food, which weakened their physical strength and promoted the spread of diseases. Since the end of the war, our country has been plagued by famines in various parts of the country due to natural and man-made disasters. This threat has not yet been lifted, and the number of people suffering from hunger is truly unknown, which is truly tragic!

Chemists believe that the essential nutrients are protein, fat, carbohydrates, minerals, and water. Recently, attention has also been paid to the issue of vitamins. Therefore, the most important things in nutrition now are probably protein, minerals, calories, and vitamins. Because if these nutrients are lacking, then there is not enough energy to supply the necessary for the human body to live, and naturally the body will get sick. What do we rely on to supply these nutrients? The food we eat is what supplies these elements. Vegetables are relatively inexpensive, but other things like meat and milk cannot be fully supplied in a period of material scarcity after the war, so the nutrition of the average person is lacking. Chemists came up with another method, using low-cost items to supply the human body's nutritional needs. Therefore, they used soybeans, which are rich in protein, as a material to make a powerful protein food. Surprisingly, eating this food has the same effect as eating other foods, enough to meet the nutritional needs of the human body. It turns out that the minerals contained in soybeans exceed those contained in flour by 10 to 15 times, the main vitamins exceed by 5 to 10 times, and the protein is as much as four times as much. Moreover, the protein in soybeans is similar in quality to that contained in beef. Because soybeans contain so many nutrients, nutritional chemists have also made it into soybean flour, making it even easier to carry and preserve for a long time.

Everyone knows that China has the largest output of soybeans in the world, but in China for thousands of years, soybeans have not been valued. Everyone only treats it as an ordinary coarse grain. Who knew that after being transformed by chemists, it would become an extremely important nutrient? However, the Northeast, which has the largest output, is currently short of food. Why not use more soybeans instead of rice and wheat? It is also a way to solve the food shortage. People are even using it as fuel, which is truly a pity.

What is even more amazing is that a completely nutritious food was also made under the efforts of a scientist. It turns out that the US Department of the Army and the United Nations have a food consultant named C. E. Clinton. In view of the increasingly serious famine after the war, he asked scientists at the California Institute of Technology to study and find ways to solve the food shortage problem. As a result, a Dr. Borook accepted this task, but this doctor did not do experiments in the laboratory, but instead thought of ways in his kitchen. Therefore, he only used pots in the kitchen as utensils, and did not use test tubes or other chemical instruments. He also hired a famous French chef as an assistant. With the scientist's great ability, after more than a year of research, he invented something with complete nutritional components, abbreviated as MPM. It seems that this is not a remarkable thing, its main component is just soy flakes with very low oil content and high protein content, and then add dehydrated sweet potatoes, vegetables, tomatoes, onions and spices, and the outside is coated with calcium and vitamins A, B, and C. But when you eat it, the color and taste are excellent, and it is very popular with both men and women, old and young. What is the nutritional value of this thing? It is said that just over two taels of dry weight can provide us with a big meal. This thing is also used to supply hundreds of schools in California, and it is very popular with teachers and students. Later, when the United Nations General Assembly was held in San Francisco, it was also used to supply representatives from various countries, and no one failed to praise it greatly.

Since this thing has been unanimously praised by all parties, it is not only inexpensive and of good quality, but also because it is a dried product, it is easier to transport. Therefore, it is not only popular in the United States, but also exported in large quantities. It is said that the United States can produce 10 million pounds per month and ship it to various parts of Europe. Calculating that each pound can provide meals for seven people, all of it can provide meals for more than 70 million people. At that time, Europe was facing a famine, and this thing happened to go to Europe to save many starving people. Aren't there many refugees in our country now? So I hope it will come to our country soon, so that the hungry people who are waiting to be fed can also taste it. But now the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) agency in our country has been withdrawn. Fortunately, Dr. Borer, who invented this food, did not patent it, so I hope the recipe and manufacturing method of this food will be known to us as soon as possible, so that we can manufacture this food ourselves, and the refugees can also solve the problem of hunger.

### Ice-Made Mansion

— Bai Shi

During World War II, the British planned to build a huge "ice island"—named "Habbakuk"—floating in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean for military aircraft to land and refuel. The famous scientist in charge of this revolutionary plan was Dr. Geoffrey Pyke. However, the war ended before his plan could be realized, but a lot of valuable information about the properties of ice had already been collected.

Dr. Pyke saw that ice is very easy to "weld" together; adding some fibrous material to it can increase its strength. To achieve this purpose, the Eskimos, who live in icy and snowy areas, have always used moss; but the British engineers used wood pulp, and the results were much better. The ideal mixture is 86% ice and 14% wood pulp—this new building material is called "Pykrete" to commemorate its inventor. After it is frozen into blocks, this material can be easily processed like wood or "artificial plastic" (such as "unbreakable glass," "bakelite," etc.), can be sawed into various shapes, and is very strong and durable. Of course, in places where the temperature is not always below freezing, artificial refrigeration must be used to keep the ice blocks solid—this is not difficult, like the method of preventing uneven expansion and contraction of parts when building huge hangars and the material has not yet solidified.

In temperate zones, with proper refrigeration, this mixture of wood pulp and ice, because it is light and strong, can be used to build temporary houses, towers, and other things that cannot be built with heavy steel-reinforced concrete. In the Arctic Circle, wooden and brick buildings often collapse or become deformed during thawing periods, and this ice can replace them as a cheap and satisfactory building material. When we start to develop the large amounts of coal and gold and other natural resources hidden in the "Antarctic Zone," using this "wood pulp ice" to build houses, etc., is obviously the cheapest and most convenient method. Naturally, these buildings do not need artificial refrigeration, and the strong winds there can be used to generate electricity to warm their interiors. The future Antarctic city may be a large pile of glittering and sparkling residences, factories, offices, schools, and roads—all made of ice!

### Electron Microscope

— Ming Yu

There is a square fluorescent screen at the focal point, and the electron stream passes through the sample in the middle, and projects the image onto the fluorescent screen, so people can see a quite large image on the screen. Such images are three and a half inches wide. However, one drawback of this microscope is the fatal blow of the electron stream to living organisms. Under an ordinary microscope, what we see are active, living things; but under an electron microscope, it is not the case, what we see are static, dead things. If we remove the fluorescent screen and replace it with a dry plate, we can take a photograph for continuous observation. However, this cannot be said to be a "photograph" because it does not use "photons," so some cautious scientists created a term called "Electron Micrographs."

The first electron photograph to meet the world was a shallow work. Under a strong cathode ray, a shadow of a banknote was left on the dry plate. This happened seventeen years ago.

From that photograph to the "toxin" micrographs taken today, it must be said that there has been a huge progress. These toxins must be so small that some are active organisms, and some are just chemical molecules. Today's scientists are explaining them with the help of these microphotographs. In short, these toxins have historically caused influenza, colds, smallpox, polio, and other diseases, or perhaps the diseases are caused by them. We are about to see the true faces of these toxins, adding many materials to the medical crime photo album.

The true images of vitamins and enzymes will also be captured. These substances were impossible to see by any method before. Once many electron microscopes are available, the wonders presented by those common substances around us and in our bodies will be countless.

The electron microscope has another possibility: that from this we may be able to further glimpse the molecular structure inside matter, which is what scientists are most excited about. Although this move is currently flawed in the structure of the super-microscope, in principle, it must be possible. As long as it can capture objects that are one hundred times smaller than it can capture today, it can also be used to observe molecules. There are many people who are using their life's energy and huge amounts of money to solve the structural patterns of molecules through this academic approach.

Chemists have always been like clever blind people using their brains as eyes. If they could once see how the molecules inside various substances are arranged, there would be an amazing progress in organic chemistry, which is needless to say. This branch of chemistry has already created "nylon," rayon, synthetic resin, and rubber sulfur for us—completely a new industry.

Why is there such a possibility? Our explanation is this: the extent to which an object is small and can still be seen by us depends on the length of the light wave we use when viewing it. In other words, the shorter the wavelength, the more it can reflect smaller parts.

The wavelength of the electron stream depends on the speed at which the electrons travel, and the rate of travel depends on the potential difference that urges them. The voltage used in today's electron microscopes ranges from 10,000 volts to 90,000 volts, and the wavelength it produces is as short as 50 angstroms (one angstrom equals one ten-millionth of a centimeter), which is equivalent to the size of the objects that can be seen today.

When the voltage reaches one million volts, the speed of the electron stream can be increased to more than 175,000 miles per second, and the wavelength is about one-hundredth of an angstrom. In a molecule containing carbon and hydrogen atoms, the distance between atoms is about two angstroms. It is not difficult to create a one million volt voltage, and scientists are likely to succeed in capturing molecular patterns.

This theory implies the goal that scientists will strive for in the future. In the past, the difficulties and hardships encountered for the infinitely small are encouraging them to move forward. A new era of exploration has begun. (To be continued)

### Industrial Underground

— Zheng Zuoqing

During World War II, the most effective way to prevent air raids on the aircraft production industry was to move all production facilities underground. The U.S. Army Air Forces Supply Command's recent study of German underground industry concludes that the above statement is undoubtedly true.

Historically, the first underground factory was the precision instrument manufacturing plant established in the Mulhausen caves in Thuringia, Germany in 1917. In 1943, the German V2 rocket manufacturing plant was also moved underground. The following year, Hitler ordered that all aircraft production facilities must be moved underground. Unfortunately, the war situation was deteriorating at that time, and there was not enough time to fully implement the underground plan.

Germany adopted two types of underground construction at that time: one was partially underground, used to resist the most devastating carpet bombing; the other was completely underground. The former mostly adopted the "submarine" structural form, which was a dome made of strong reinforced concrete, surrounded by huge walls and thick covers. Another form of partial underground structure was the "coal bunker" type, which was roughly similar to the "submarine" structure. These structures were roughly 80 feet high, divided into four to six floors, with a total plane of 1.2 million square feet, of which 40% of the plane was underground. Although the "coal bunker" structure was not fully completed for use, this design seemed to be the most suitable semi-underground structure in Germany. It has a large amount of plane available for use, and the height is appropriate, the access is convenient, and all defense facilities are quite effective.

### Colloids

— Qu Youding

Matter can usually be divided into three states: liquid, solid, and gas, but in addition, there is also a colloid. This is formed by suspending certain substances such as sulfur, Prussian blue, or even pure gold in a liquid substance. The suspended particles of this substance are so small that they cannot be seen even with the highest-powered microscope, but they do not dissolve in the liquid. This phenomenon was first discovered about a hundred years ago by Semi Berzlius and Faracay. Within a few years, Thomas Graam of England discovered that truly dissolved substances can freely pass through parchment paper or animal membranes, but strange liquids such as gelatin and animal glue are not like this. To distinguish them from the aforementioned colloidal suspensions, he called them sols. After many people's research, it was learned that these so-called colloids are not another state of matter. This is not a matter of substance type, but a matter of particle size. The size of these colloid particles cannot be observed with an ordinary microscope.

Under appropriate conditions, any substance can be made into a sol state. There are several ways to do this. The particles can be built or concentrated by the reaction of atoms, molecules, or ions, or they can be obtained by crushing and separating larger particles. For example, adding a concentrated iron chloride solution to boiling water can obtain colloidal particles of iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)3). These small particles are separated after iron chloride (FeCl3) is quickly hydrolyzed by water, and can be suspended for many years without falling. The color of this colloid is dark brown. However, the iron chloride solution should not be added too quickly, otherwise iron oxide will be obtained instead of iron hydroxide. When iron chloride is hydrolyzed, hydrochloric acid is also produced at the same time, which remains in the colloid; if you want to remove it, you must use Gragam's famous separation method, namely dialysis. If a capillary membrane filter and an animal membrane are used, although hydrochloric acid and colloid can pass through the filter membrane, when the acid solution passes through the animal membrane, the colloid is blocked back (iron hydroxide particles cannot pass through). Gragam used pig bladder and parchment paper, and the colloid membrane and water immersion machine used now are more effective. The method is to cut the membrane into a circle with a diameter of eight to eleven inches, then make a funnel shape, tightly tie the lower end to form a bag, pour the colloid liquid into it, half full, and then place the bag in a water basin. After a few minutes, put the blue litmus paper into the water, and you will see it turn from blue to red, which means that the water has become acidic.

Why do colloids and the like appear to be suspended? There are two reasons: one is that the supporting liquid's sub-thousandth of the movement, colliding the colloid point back and forth, resists the earth's gravitational force; the other is that the colloid points are each charged, repelling each other. The latter can be known from the following experiment: the method is to connect the two poles of a forty-five volt or ninety volt battery to two carbon rods, and place them separately at both ends of a V-shaped tube filled with Prussian blue colloid liquid. Because the points of this colloid are negatively charged, they are repelled by the negative pole and attracted by the positive pole; after a few minutes, you can see the blue substance moving from the negative pole to the positive pole. If it is an oxygenated iron colloid, because its particles are positively charged, the situation is reversed, and it is not very obvious, and when it gathers at the negative pole, there is a phenomenon of falling.

From this, we can imagine that if two types of colloid particles with opposite charges are mixed in appropriate amounts, their protons will attract each other, so that the charge is neutralized, and the particles often cannot be suspended again; therefore, when Prussian blue and oxygenated colloid points are mixed, larger particles are seen falling to the bottom of the container. If sufficient acid, lye, and other charged colloids are added, the charge can also be neutralized, causing them to fall; this is why aluminum sulfate or iron sulfate is often added to muddy water in cities to clean drinking water. principle.

There is a method of destroying large particles to form colloid particles, called Peptization. This method can be known from the following example: coat a water filter with a thick Prussian blue paste, and oxalic acid (C2H2O4) color immediately begins to invade the fine pores of the water filter; if you find a way to remove the oxalic acid, the remaining blue will become colloidal. According to this, colloidal Prussian blue is the raw material for writing ink and is widely used as a dye.

Also, colloidal points can often be produced by the following method: another solution dilutes a solution containing a certain solid. However, the solution used for dilution needs to be one that cannot dissolve the same body. For example, pouring a sulfur alcohol solution into water can obtain a milky sulfur sol. Making shellac white is another example, because water dilutes the alcohol that dissolves shellac grease; shellac grease is insoluble in water, so it becomes colloidal points that precipitate in water, and because it has light scattering properties, it appears white.

### Alkali—One Cannot Live Without It For A Day

— Wang Qiande

Humans cannot live on earth without the supply of water. This is a very common thing that everyone knows, but similarly, humans cannot live on earth without alkali for a day; I am afraid everyone will be surprised or even laugh at this! Please understand the following facts clearly, and you can turn your doubts into trust.

"Alkali" is a general name. In fact, if you want to divide it carefully, you can divide it into three types: soda ash (soda) Sodium Carbonate, caustic soda (caustic soda) Sodium Hydroxide, and baking soda (baking soda Ssdium Bicarbonate). Now, according to the above order, let's talk about their main uses separately:

Soda Ash—In cities, it is not uncommon for relatively new houses and buildings to have several glass windows, but the main raw material for that window glass is soda ash.

Anyone who has lived in the countryside must have seen or heard that the women in the countryside often use grass ash as a detergent to scrub dirty clothes in the grass ash. The clothes after washing are indeed very clean. What is the reason? Because grass ash contains soda ash, and soda ash has the ability to remove dirt.

More importantly, without soda ash, I am afraid that there would be no ships coming and going in the ocean today, and the coastal cities would still be poor rural areas, unable to have modern industries, because seawater contains minerals such as magnesium, calcium, and aluminum. All water containing such minerals is called "hard water." It is absolutely unsuitable for factory boilers and the heart of ships—steam boilers—and will cause explosions after a long time. Therefore, the water used by factories in coastal areas or ships sailing in the ocean must first be softened with "soda ash" and lime before it can be used without any worries.

Other industries such as the textile industry, the production of bubble alkali, and the production of toothpaste are all related to alkali.

Caustic Soda—Soap is a household item, a detergent that cannot be missing for a day. Anyone will have the opportunity to use soap. Whether it is medicated soap, perfume soap, or laundry soap, the main raw material cannot escape caustic soda.

Furthermore, without caustic soda, where would the now fine whatman paper and newsprint come from? I am afraid it would still only be extremely rough bamboo paper! Because the first step in manufacturing pulp is to corrode the raw materials into pure fibers, and "caustic soda" is a very strong corrosive agent.

Mercerized socks and mercerized cloth are quite popular in modern cities, but I am afraid that only a very small number of people know the raw materials. When it comes to mercerized cloth and mercerized socks, we should commemorate Mercer—the originator of mercerized cloth—and thank caustic soda; many people think that mercerized cloth is woven with silk and cotton, but this is completely wrong. The so-called mercerized cloth is only cotton yarn treated with caustic soda solution, so that the straight cotton fibers become spiral. The cotton cloth woven from spiral fibers emits a silky luster due to the reflection of light, becoming the popular mercerized cloth. Furthermore, rayon, the natural silk's powerful enemy, is nothing more than a product of caustic soda treatment of waste materials.

Also, the monosodium glutamate used for seasoning is also a product made from caustic soda.

Baking Soda—In the hot summer weather, cold drinks are the holy product for quenching thirst and relieving heat. Soda is a type of cold drink. Why does soda have gas? This is because carbon dioxide gas is pressed into the soda. Carbon dioxide gas will produce bubbles when the pressure is released, so sometimes when the soda bottle cap is opened, even the soda ice will spray out, but you should know that baking soda is the best raw material for making carbon dioxide.

A few years ago, baking soda was a good medicine for stomach diseases, but now it has gradually become obsolete.

If you often eat bread, flatbread, or fried dough sticks, the yeast for fermentation is made from baking soda.

Some red fire extinguishers on the wall are also made from a solution of baking soda and sulfuric acid.

Can humans live on earth without washing clothes? Can you not use soap? Can you not use paper? If your answer is "no," then you have to admit the importance of alkali.

### Sixty Dishes

— He Ku

The arrival of the President Cleveland ocean liner in Shanghai really made Shanghai's money-chasing craze sweep for a while. The newspapers have not seen such frivolous news representing peace for a long time. It is enough for us to appreciate the luxury of this ocean liner from paper.

The food on the ship alone is enough to make people gasp. A large meal has more than sixty dishes. You can choose from delicacies from land and sea. If you are a glutton with a large appetite, as long as you can eat it, you can take all sixty dishes without adding additional fees. As the Chinese saying goes, "Once you open a restaurant, you are not afraid of big stomachs." The Cleveland truly put this into practice. But I dare say that even someone with a slightly better appetite will never be able to eat all sixty dishes: this means that the shipping company is generous, but the enjoyment of passengers has a saturation point, just as "the years of the universe are infinite, while the lifespan of human beings is limited."

Therefore, I don't think there is anything to envy about Cleveland. Because she only provides a sumptuous meal for five hundred and several passengers, and cannot provide a portion of filling dry food for everyone who needs food. Mencius once questioned the King of Qi, "Which is more enjoyable, to enjoy alone or to enjoy with others?" The conclusion is "It is better to enjoy with others!" If you compare Cleveland to the world, it is exactly the distinction between "enjoying alone" and "enjoying with others." Even though she has a large meal with sixty dishes, how much digestive power is there between the stomach and intestines, only two or three dishes?

When most people in the world can only squeeze into trams and are cramped on small steamers, a Cleveland is just a auspicious grass in paradise, and has nothing to do with the ordinary plants on the ground. As for whether auspicious grass can grow on the ground, my answer is affirmative, but the ordinary plants have to work hard themselves!

### Talking About Playing With Fire

— Yi Feng

Greek mythology says this: there was originally no fire in the human world. Since Prometheus stole it from heaven and gave it to the human world, the human world began to have shining, heating, and lovely flames of fire. Therefore, it also caused God's great annoyance. He locked him with chains on a mountain peak and let eagles peck at his lungs as a punishment for stealing fire. Although this is a myth, why was God so stingy with his fire and unwilling to give it to humans? I think it was probably because when he created humans, he had already foreseen that human ambition would be difficult to train. Once there was fire, it would be even worse, and the world would come to an end because people with ambition played with fire, right? Otherwise, why would Prometheus, who stole fire for people, receive such a severe punishment?

The fact is indeed the case. Since there has been fire in the world, many fire players have continued to emerge. These fire players are all powerful and self-willed, and ambitious tyrants. They used fire as a weapon to kill people, conquer others, and massacre the good, causing humans to suffer unprecedented misfortune and inevitably die in large numbers. Prometheus, who suffered for humans and kindly stole fire for the world, will definitely regret it when he hears this, right?

Yes, "fire players often perish in fire," and as the saying goes, "playing with fire gets you burned," which seems to be a punishment deliberately given by God to a group of ambitious people. However, the fact is very sad. Ambitious people who "play with fire and perish in fire" continue to emerge, and the effect of "lessons from the past" is actually very small!

Isn't that so? Twenty years after William, there was Hitler. This guy was so majestic! At the beginning of the Second World War, a fire destroyed Poland, and another fire destroyed France. In two months, he swept the European continent. He is truly a strong man among fire-playing groups from ancient times to the present. But he finally couldn't escape the law of "playing with fire and getting burned." The good times didn't last long. He was frustrated by the blizzard in Moscow, and then frustrated by Uncle Sam's aircraft fleet. In the end, he had to "immolate himself" in the presidential palace in Berlin. The Japanese devils were also like this. From the fire of "September 18th" to the fire of "March 8th," they were really proud in the East for ten years; however, by the same token, they returned it to their own bodies. The unprecedented fire of the atomic bomb finally burned on the gate in August 1945, and they had to declare surrender!

Today, more than two years after the end of the Second World War, new fire-playing is rapidly approaching and the mountains of "ashes rekindling" are rising. The politics of "power" has not changed its face in the slightest. If the Third World War is unavoidable, then the wildfire will burn even more fiercely, and the misfortune of mankind will be even deeper and more bitter. Seeing that the flames of war have spread all over the world, I can't help but worry about those who set the fire!

### Eradicating Illiteracy

— Fang Ren

Generally speaking, Shanghai is a culturally developed place, incomparable to the closed-off inland areas. However, according to statistics recently published by the Civil Affairs Bureau in this newspaper, among the 4,449,290 citizens, as many as 1,885,569 are illiterate, accounting for approximately 42% of the total population.

Since the Northern Expedition, our country has been paying attention to the work of eradicating illiteracy from the very beginning, and is still actively carrying it out. However, there is a common problem among Chinese people, which is the idea of "sweep the snow from your own doorstep and don't worry about the frost on your neighbor's roof." Regarding the work of eradicating illiteracy, schools, apart from the so-called "mass schools," never inquire about it. For example, the city currently has more than 140 mass schools, but because they do not have their own school buildings, they have to borrow from private primary and secondary schools, which has caused a lot of complications.

In fact, China is a poor country, and if we want to eradicate illiteracy, we can only adopt the most economical methods. Not to mention the existing educational institutions, which should make full use of empty classrooms at night. Even theaters, dance halls, or amusement parks can be used as places to promote social education when they are empty during the day or in the morning. Classrooms for eradicating illiteracy? This solves the problem of space. If we can supplement it with mobile education facilities, we can save the illiterate from trekking long distances, which will definitely be more effective. As for personnel, it is not excessive to conscript some intellectuals to assist. Therefore, eradicating illiteracy is not a matter of whether it can be done, but whether it will be done.

I remember that at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) meeting, our country was listed as a dark area. What a shame! We should aspire to "China without illiteracy"; otherwise, the country's construction and its status will never be possible.

### Notes on the Harvard Library

— Jin Jin

Harvard University in the United States is one of the top universities. Its library has a long history, established in 1638 with a donation of 400 books by John Harvard. Its collection is rich, with more than 4.6 million volumes of various books, making it the largest university library in the world. Among them, about 2 million volumes are housed in the Widener Memorial Library, completed in 1915. In addition, more than 100,000 rare books and manuscripts are housed in the Houghton Library, newly built in 1942. The humidity and temperature in the library are mechanically adjusted, and the latest instruments are used to maintain air cleanliness. The two buildings are interconnected by bridges and passages.

In addition, the university library itself is divided into 75 sections, each equivalent to a specialized library. Among them, the ones with the most books are: the law and medicine section, with 280,000 volumes; the business administration section, also known as the Baker Library; the Du-Ford Harvard Library, with 193,000 volumes; the public administration section, also known as the Littauer School of Public Administration Library, with 198,000 volumes; the Chinese and Japanese book section of the Harvard-Yenching Institute, with 185,000 volumes; the biological laboratory, with 73,000 volumes; and the observatory, with 37,000 volumes. They are truly a dazzling array of priceless treasures. All of the above libraries have a general catalog, telephone equipment, and messengers to deliver messages to maintain close contact.

Harvard University adds an average of 113,000 volumes each year. The library has endowments donated by various sectors, reaching more than US$3.7 million, and the income is used exclusively for purchasing books and library expenses.

Furthermore, the library's rare books number about 2,600 volumes, published before 1501. There are many works and manuscripts by the famous poet Keats, specially stored in a special room in Houghton Library. Other English writers from Chaucer onwards, and contemporary literary giants such as Mansfield, Joyce, Eliot, Robin Niu, and Steinbeck, all have their manuscripts fully collected.

Naturally, the Harvard University Library also collects many wonderful books that are not within the scope of university education research, such as chess scores, cookbooks, fishing scriptures, and joke collections, some of which are donated from the outside.

Finally, it must be added that the library has a particularly large collection of drama-related books, occupying several large rooms in the Widener Building, including more than one million playbills and brochures, and 260,000 photos of male and female actors, comparable to the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., known for its collection of early English theatrical history materials, and the New York Public Library, which specializes in collecting modern drama scripts.

Finally, the library's "poetry room" contains masterpieces by major contemporary poets. The map section in the Widener Building mainly collects ancient maps, while modern maps are managed by the branch library of the Institute for Geographical Exploration.

### The Forgetful Scholar

— Lei Hong

Young Professor Oppenheimer was the leader of the atomic bomb experiment in New Mexico. But in his youth, he was often a careless fellow.

Once, he took his girlfriend out for a drive. Suddenly, the gasoline ran out, and it was a chilly autumn evening. So Oppenheimer took off his coat and asked his girlfriend to put it on to ward off the cold, and he rushed to a nearby gas station to find a way to get gasoline.

The girlfriend waited in the car. After an hour, he still didn't come back, so she panicked and reported it to the highway patrol.

The police easily solved the matter - they went directly to Oppenheimer's home and found him sound asleep in bed. He had completely forgotten about taking his girlfriend out, as well as his car, his coat, and so on.

### Haydn and His Creation

— Lord

On the 25th of this month and the 1st of next month, there will be a grand sacred music concert at the Lyceum Theatre, a cooperative performance of the Ya Xue Society, which has a 30-year history, and the Symphony Orchestra, which has a 60-year history. This is the first cooperative performance after the victory, conducted by Professor Fu Hua. This reminds us of the grand scene when Master Mei Baiqi conducted these two orchestras before the war. Looking back on the past and comparing it to the present, some of the members who were young at the time are now gray-haired!

The program is Joseph Haydn's oratorio "The Creation".

Haydn, revered as the "Father of the Sonata" and the "Father of the Symphony," was also a great composer of sacred music. He was born in a cold village near Vienna in 1732. His father was a cartwright. But from an early age, he was a musical genius. At the age of eight, he entered the church as a choirboy and received musical education. Nine years later, he was dismissed due to voice change. Afterwards, he lived a difficult life, but he still worked hard to study composition, reading the works of the sonata composer Bach all day long. After 1760, he served as music director in the home of the music-loving Esterházy brothers for 30 years. Most of his works were completed here, and he was known as Bach's successor. In 1790, he went to London to travel and perform, and was inspired by Handel's oratorios. During his second visit, he obtained the script of "The Creation" and completed his great oratorio "The Creation" from 1795 to 1798.

"The Creation" not only expresses the author's noble character, but also is a culmination of the advantages of musical compositions, simple and majestic, and profound poetic meaning penetrates into the two realms of form and meaning. And the excellence of the style reveals the extraordinary mystery of the Creator. It can be said to encompass everything and contain everything, such as his writing of the revelation of chaos, the escape of the nether, the first appearance of the dawn, the changes of the universe, the fusion of the beauty of creation and the truth of art. It is truly a great work of immortal value.

The work is divided into three sections and 24 movements. The string music "Primeval Chaos" is used as a prelude, which is a pioneer in the style of oratorios. The characters in the song are angels Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael, and Adam and Eve.

The work was completed on April 29, 1798, and premiered at the Esterházy Palace the next day. It was publicly performed at the Royal Theatre on March 19, 1799, and the audience was greatly moved. At that time, the old musician said, "I cried, feeling as cold as ice, and then as hot as a fire." In his later years, he said, "Before composing "The Creation" every day, I pray to God to grant me the ability. I have never been so devout in my life."

Haydn has 120 symphonies in other works, including the famous "Farewell Symphony," which was written early in the Esterházy home as a farewell song for a group of musicians who were about to be disbanded. During the performance, one musician after another extinguished the candles in front of them, silently withdrew with their instruments, and finally only one violinist was left, and the atmosphere was very bleak. But at the same time, we can also see his humor in his works, such as in the quiet second movement of the Surprise Symphony, a sudden burst of loud drumbeats surprises the sleepy listeners, which is so humorous!

Therefore, in his old age, the ethereal and celestial "Creation" was produced. He passed away in 1809 in Vienna.

### A Song of Self-Examination

— Kang Min

Loving good people and hating evil people is the common feeling of most people, and at least 99 out of 100 people put themselves in the category of good people. Even if someone reflects that they cannot be called a good person, I believe they are still trying their best to be a good person, and even more hope that others will praise them as a good person. Indeed, there are no inherently evil people in the world, and there are no people who deliberately harbor evil intentions. All those who commit evil and break the law have their own reasons and positions to forgive themselves.

However, are people really all good people? Even sages have faults. Examining oneself, who has no guilty conscience? Sima Guang himself said that in his life, he had never done anything that he could not tell others. This statement is probably no exception to the style of historical exaggeration.

Our country is not rich and strong. Although there are many reasons, it can be summarized in one sentence: the morality of the people is low. This is an educational problem, and educational problems cannot be solved in a few short years. At present, to rescue the continued decline of national morality, I think it is a matter of great urgency. The only way to achieve quick results is the method of "self-examination". I sincerely hope that everyone will conduct self-examination and reflection once a day.

Especially those who do not cooperate, are not responsible, do not produce, waste public property, seek private gain, speculate, are lazy, indulge, and are decadent, I pray that they will ask themselves: what are they living for? Is there a moment of peace in their conscience?

I am not qualified to teach those noble and wealthy "criminals of conscience", and they do not need my teaching either. Because everyone has a bright red and kind heart. I have already said that loving good people and hating evil people is the common feeling of people, and everyone likes others to praise them as good people. Therefore, as long as they have the opportunity to calm down and think about it, there will be a solution.

It does not mean that after a self-examination, a person's moral concept can be immediately improved, just like a patient who is extremely malnourished cannot restore health by swallowing a large amount of vitamins at once. But I firmly believe that as long as he has the opportunity to ask himself once a day, his conscience will definitely strongly pull him upward, make him progress, and succeed.

### Journalism

— Gang

The telegraph editor told a rural correspondent that in the future, articles must not omit the names of news figures, otherwise he would be fired.

A few days later, the editor received a telegram:

"Kangzhuang, 10th - This afternoon, there was a heavy thunderstorm here. Lightning struck the barbed wire of Wilson's pasture, killing three cows. Their names are Jinhua, Haitang, and Fengzhi."

### Catching Shadows

— Mao Yi

A woman fainted in the street and was helped into a pharmacy. As a result, people on the street gathered around, and latecomers eagerly asked, "What happened?" The matter became somewhat mysterious, and people began to spread rumors that the bank across the street had been robbed.

A few minutes later, an ambulance called by the woman arrived, and police officers pushed through the crowd and entered the bank. Finally, people began to wonder why they were standing there. But no one knew.

At this time, the woman who had fainted recovered her energy and walked out of the pharmacy. Seeing such a large crowd, she asked people what had happened.

"Something happened at the bank," said a pedestrian.

### Strange Contract

— Leng Leng

A wealthy man in France made a contract with a bohemian and nihilistic youth, stipulating that the youth must live alone in a closed dark room for fifteen years. The dark room was full of famous philosophical books for fifteen years of reading. The rich man was responsible for providing three meals a day, and was not responsible for anything else. After the expiration of the period, all the property would be given to the youth. Leaving the dark room even one step halfway would be regarded as a breach of contract, and there would be nothing. And the youth should issue another proof, stating that the rich man was not involved in the case of death or suicide due to illness during the period. There was also an addendum that if the rich man died for some reason during the performance of the contract, the youth would immediately have the right to obtain all the property.

When it began to be implemented for a few months, the servant who delivered the meals saw the youth singing loudly all day long, and then he browsed the books silently. After a considerable period of time, he talked to himself hysterically and talked eloquently. In the third year, the youth seemed to be working hard, referring to books, and working hard to write. After ten years, until the thirteenth year, the rich man unfortunately died of illness. The consulting lawyer followed the will and respectfully invited the youth to leave the room to open the vault together and accept the property. Unexpectedly, it was already empty. It turned out that the youth had become a profound philosopher after studying hard for several years and had written several special books. He felt that he could not bury himself in the dark room and waste his time, so he resolutely bribed the servant who delivered the meals and escaped. Now he has been honorably appointed as a university professor and is a famous philosophical authority.

The lawyer finally found him and asked him to fulfill the contract. Of course, he refused, and the rich man had no relatives to inherit the property. Therefore, with the consent of both parties, it was decided to donate all the property to public welfare undertakings. So under the supervision of the philosophy professor, the lawyer, and local fair-minded people, the rich man's vault was opened. Unexpectedly, it was empty, with only a note signed by the rich man himself pasted on the door inside the box, simply writing a few words: "Congratulations, you have become a famous philosopher. I know you don't need my property now. Learning, reputation, and status are your only property. I have donated all the property to public welfare undertakings in the name of an anonymous person, and you will definitely agree with my measures. May God bless our philosopher!"

The philosophy professor thanked the rich man for his kindness, and used the rich man's name to set up a scholarship in the university where he taught, to commemorate him forever.

### The Death of Tong Guan

— Wang Baili

The biography of Tong Guan briefly states: "Guan was influential, and Cai Jing's advancement was due to Guan's efforts. People at the time called Jing the 'Duke Chancellor' and Guan the 'Old Woman Chancellor'. During the Northern Expedition, he started border disputes. The Jin people broke the alliance and went south. Guan was terrified and fled to the capital to escort the Emperor Emeritus to the south, fearing that he would not go fast enough. He was later beheaded in Yingzhou." The official history records this, which is credible. However, according to Lu You's Notes from an Old Study, Guan was executed in Nanxiong Prefecture. The note states: "After Tong Guan received the imperial edict to be executed, the imperial censor Zhang Daming was specially ordered to carry out the order. When he was about to arrive at Nanxiong Prefecture, Guan was there. Daming was afraid that he would hear about it and commit suicide, so he would not be able to clearly administer the criminal law. So he first sent a personal officer to see Guan. When he arrived, he presented his credentials and congratulated him in the courtyard. Guan asked why. He said, 'There is an edict to send a eunuch to bestow tea and medicine, and to summon the Great King to the capital, and I have heard that there is an order to pacify Hebei.' Guan asked if it was true. He replied, 'The generals today are all latecomers and cannot be entrusted. Therefore, the Emperor and the ministers discussed and thought that there was no one like Your Majesty who had prestige, was familiar with border affairs, so there was this order.' Guan was overjoyed and said to his attendants, 'It turns out that they cannot do without me!' The next day, Daming arrived, and Guan was executed." This shows that Guan died in Nanxiong Prefecture, not in Yingzhou, which is explained in detail. According to my research, Nanxiong Prefecture is now Nanxiong County, located on the main road from Guangdong to Jiangxi. The Song History says that Guan was beheaded in Yingzhou, Yingzhou may have been the place where Guan was exiled when he was convicted, not the place where Guan was executed. Looking at the words "When he was about to arrive at Nanxiong, Guan was there" in the Notes from an Old Study, it can be seen that Zhang Daming was originally planning to go to Yingzhou to carry out the appointment when he was ordered to execute Guan. However, when he was about to arrive at Nanxiong, he heard that Guan was there, so he executed him on the spot in Nanxiong, without having to go to Yingzhou again. Moreover, the Song History was written by Tuotuo and others of the Yuan Dynasty, more than a hundred years after Guan's death, and there are bound to be omissions. Lu You was a person of the early Southern Song Dynasty, close to the death of Tong Guan, and what he saw and heard should be more detailed. Therefore, there is no doubt that Tong Guan was executed in Nanxiong Prefecture.

### Carefree Flowers

— Chen Shengyan

Chapter 9: Leaking Secrets (53)

Qi Wan said, "Your plan is very good, but I still want to use the east and west wing rooms as a gym, preparing a billiard table and a ping-pong table. What do you think?" Zhu Zhai said, "Then paving the platform of the wing room with flower tiles will be even more beautiful." Qi Wan said, "Let's decide that now! Do you know any familiar lumber mills? You can handle everything for me." Zhu Zhai was usually good at planning house furnishings, etc., and was also most interested in it, and agreed readily. From this day on, Zhu Zhai, in addition to going to the bank, ran around for Qi Wan's construction work. He not only went to supervise the work every day, but also planned the colors for the walls and arranged flowers and stones in the courtyard, striving for beauty and sanitation. After the construction work was completed, he was busy installing lights and furnishing furniture, making sure that every room and every item was suitable. Qi Wan was very happy to see that his arrangement was very effective, because she was not very familiar with all of this, and handed it over to Zhu Zhai to handle completely. After two months, an old-fashioned building was transformed by Zhu Zhai into a very artistic building. In these two months, Zhu Zhai ran around for Qi Wan every day, handling construction work and purchasing equipment, etc., almost without any free time. Not only did he not see Feng Sheng there, but he also did not go to Yun Qing's house often. Yun Qing was a careful person, seeing that Zhu Zhai's attitude was becoming more and more indifferent, as if he was interested in someone else. She tried to test him during conversations, but he always avoided it and could not get any information out of him. When she occasionally mentioned the future results of the two, Zhu Zhai always frowned, deeply concerned about his father's hurdle, which was not easy to overcome. Yun Qing carefully observed the situation, and could not think of a good strategy for how to use it in the future to achieve satisfactory results with the elderly. She was worried that Zhu Zhai's expression had changed recently and had to take precautions. Whenever she saw that Zhu Zhai had not come for two days, she would call the bank dormitory to inquire, and sometimes even asked him to come home for dinner. Zhu Zhai was given such a runaround by her, and had a situation of losing sight of the other, and was very depressed in his heart. He repeatedly expressed to Qi Wan that it would be better to hold our wedding sooner, and a traveling wedding would be the most trouble-saving, but Qi Wan paid no attention to this point, thinking that such a procedure was too hasty. Since she had divorced Feng Sheng, there was no legal problem, and she could get married whenever she wanted. Seeing that Zhu Zhai did not pay attention to her meaning, and could not tell her the suffering completely, his heart was just embarrassed. One day, after Zhu Zhai got off work, he went to Qi Wan's new house and went with Qi Wan to the East City to look for carpets, because almost everything in Qi Wan's new house had been arranged, only the large carpet in the living room had not been settled. The walls of the living room were light blue, and according to Zhu Zhai's idea, the carpet had to be dark blue to match, but it was not easy to find a dark blue carpet of the right size for Qi Wan's living room in many places. This day, introduced by a colleague from the bank, they went to the Xinyi Carpet Shop in the East City and saw a blue carpet. Zhu Zhai hurriedly made an appointment with Qi Wan to go to the East City to buy it together when he got off work, but Yun Qing called him several times to ask him to go.
