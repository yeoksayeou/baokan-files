### Promulgation of the Sino-American Bilateral Agreement: Scope Limited to Economic Aid, Valid Until the End of June of the Year After Next

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 3] The Sino-American Bilateral Agreement regarding the use of American aid was signed at 3:00 PM on July 3 in the reception room on the second floor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At 3:15 PM, the Chinese representative, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, and the American representative, Ambassador Stuart, sat side-by-side at a long table. Amidst the flashes of magnesium lights, they simultaneously began to sign two original copies of the agreement. In the Chinese version, Ambassador Stuart, as usual, signed his Chinese surname. After exchanging and signing the two original copies, Foreign Minister Wang and Ambassador Stuart shook hands to express their congratulations and took group photos with all the Chinese and American officials present. Subsequently, they each delivered brief speeches. Foreign Minister Wang first expressed his deep satisfaction that the bilateral agreement could be signed as scheduled and praised the cooperative spirit of the staff of the American Embassy during the negotiations. He also stated: "The Chinese government and people are sincerely grateful for the assistance from the United States and are determined to work hard to promote self-reliance." Ambassador Stuart then read his written statement (see below). After he finished, Lapham also delivered a speech, saying: "Administrator Hoffman of the Economic Cooperation Administration of the United States is extremely concerned about the progress of aid to China. Now that the bilateral agreement has been signed in a timely manner, it is sincerely hoped that the two sides can cooperate closely in the future to maximize the effectiveness of American aid." The entire signing ceremony lasted only a little over ten minutes, and the ceremony and arrangements were extremely simple. It reminded people of the similar circumstances of the signing of the Sino-American Relief Agreement and the Sino-American Naval Agreement in the same reception room last year. When signing the relief agreement, Ambassador Stuart said, "This is only the beginning of assistance." The American aid stipulated in the bilateral agreement should be a continuation of that. This reception room will soon become a historical site recording Sino-American friendship. Those who attended the signing ceremony on July 3 included Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Shishun, Director of the Treaty Department Hu Qingyu, Deputy Director Wang Xiaoxi, Director of the American Affairs Department Dong Lin, Deputy Director Chen Shicai, Director of the Protocol Department Shen Changhuan, Director of the Intelligence Department Shi Zhaoying, Deputy Director Zhou Shukai, Minister of the American Embassy Clark, Commercial Counselor McKinley, Secretary Bowen Jie. Moir, Resident Representative of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration in China Lapham, and his special assistant, Bartman. (The full text of the Sino-American Bilateral Agreement will be published on page two.)

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, July 3] The content of the Sino-American Bilateral Agreement signed on the afternoon of July 3 is largely consistent with the bilateral agreements signed with the United States and European recipient countries. Its scope of application is limited to the economic assistance portion of the US$400 million in American aid, which amounts to US$275 million. The military assistance portion of US$125 million will be handled separately. This agreement is valid until the end of June 1950.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 3] The Sino-American Bilateral Agreement and its annexes and exchange of notes were formally announced on July 3, and Foreign Minister Wang also issued a statement clarifying the main points of this American aid. The full text of the agreement contains twelve articles, stipulating the matters related to the use of the economic assistance portion of the US$400 million and the obligations assumed by China as a result. The "Annex" lists the understanding of certain articles in the agreement. The "Exchange of Notes" concerns the provision that trade in goods from West Germany and the Free Territory of Trieste should enjoy most-favored-nation treatment as stipulated in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade before the end of 1950. The agreement is valid until June 30, 1950, that is, it will continue to be effective for fifteen months after the twelve-month period for the use of American aid from April of this year to March of next year is completed.

### Comprehensive Explanation of the Entire American Aid Issue by Minister Wang

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 3] On July 3, Foreign Minister Wang, representing China, signed the American Aid Agreement. In addition to publishing the full text of the agreement and its annexes, he also provided the following comprehensive explanation of the entire American aid issue:

(1) The total amount of funds decided by the U.S. Congress for aid to China this time is US$400 million.

(2) The purpose of the U.S. aid to China this time, as clearly stated in its congressional bill, is to assist the Chinese government in stabilizing the domestic economy and establishing domestic peace as soon as possible.

(3) The US$400 million in aid to China decided by the U.S. Congress is divided into two types: economic assistance and special assistance. Economic assistance is US$275 million, and special assistance is US$125 million.

(4) The Sino-American Bilateral Agreement and its annexes signed today only apply to the aforementioned economic assistance. The content of this bilateral agreement is largely consistent with the content of the bilateral agreements signed by the United States and European recipient countries. The main points of the Sino-American Bilateral Agreement are listed below:

(A) The agreement does not stipulate the repayment of this aid. According to mutual understanding, this economic aid is generally in the nature of a grant, except for a small portion used for special construction projects, for which repayment methods may be discussed separately in the future.

(B) This amount is scheduled to be used for twelve months (i.e., from April 3 of this year to April 3, 1949). As for the effective period of the articles of this agreement, it is set from the date of signing to June 30, 1950.

(C) The U.S. government reserves the right to suspend the disbursement of the aforementioned grant.

(D) China must take possible measures to utilize its own resources and national financial strength to develop industry and agriculture, improve the financial and monetary system, reduce trade barriers, and promote foreign commercial relations. China should provide the United States with convenient opportunities to purchase items that the United States lacks and that China can export, on a fair trade basis. The Chinese government has the responsibility to fully inform the Chinese people of all facts concerning American aid.

(E) How the national currency obtained from the sale of American aid materials should be handled must be agreed upon by representatives of both China and the United States. The ways of handling it are approximately: (1) Freezing (i.e., withdrawing legal tender to stabilize finance and prices), (2) Using it for certain types of industrial and mining railway construction and rural restoration work.

(5) The US$125 million for special assistance will be handled separately. The U.S. government has notified our ambassador to the United States of the procedures for allocating the aid, and this ministry has instructed our ambassador to the United States to reply in agreement on July 2. The funds can then be used. The period of use for this fund is twelve months. This fund is used for military needs, without any conditions attached, and its nature is a grant. The above is the content of the American Aid Agreement. As for the achievement of the two goals of American aid, "assisting China in stabilizing the economy and establishing domestic peace as soon as possible," it requires the sincere cooperation of the personnel responsible for implementation on both the Chinese and American sides, and it still depends on our efforts in self-reliance in the future.

### Remarks by the American Ambassador: Eager to Enhance Friendship

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, July 3] Ambassador Stuart of the United States made the following remarks after the signing of the Sino-American Bilateral Agreement: "I am very pleased that the United States and China have signed a bilateral agreement today. I know that the American people will also be very pleased. According to the agreement, the United States agrees to assist China in the struggle to restore normal life, because years of war have disrupted this life. The American people fully understand the great sacrifices China has made in our common struggle against Japan. The American people also fully understand that there is no hope for a just and lasting peace in the world if any place is disturbed by unrest, or if any nation is unable to have the opportunity to seek a decent life so as to gain its dignified position in the world. The American people hope to assist the Chinese people in self-reliance, reaching a state of peace, prosperity, and human dignity. We are eager for this agreement to be another strong and lasting link in the bond of friendship and cooperation, which has always been an outstanding characteristic of Sino-American relations."

### Tianjin and Beiping Open Foreign Exchange, Yesterday's Transactions Very Few

Three Senior Officials of the National Bank Returned to Shanghai

[Special Dispatch from Beiping, July 3] Three senior officials of the National Bank are in Beiping to discuss with Fu Zuoyi the abolition of the suspension of exchange for circulating currency and the restriction on the withdrawal of remittances from the Northeast. Results may be achieved today, and the old methods may be restored next week, that is, remittances below 200 million can be freely withdrawn. In addition, preparations are being made to exchange cloth for coarse grains from Chahar and Suiyuan. The three officials will no longer go to the Northeast and will return to Shanghai in the next few days to report back.

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Beiping, July 3] After the banks in the city of Beiping opened for foreign exchange applications on July 3, the total amount of foreign exchange applied for by the banks was no more than 30 billion, which was very small. According to authoritative analysis from the financial community, the reasons are: (1) Lack of cash, (2) Today is the weekend, and cash cannot be withdrawn on Sunday, (3) The Shanghai market has been severely controlled by the authorities, making speculation difficult.

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Tianjin, July 3] Tianjin officially opened for foreign exchange applications on July 3. The Tianjin branch of the Central Bank announced an exchange rate of 70 yuan, and the actual exchange rate was calculated at 80% of the listed price. July 3 was Saturday, and there were very few remittances.

### Interrogation on the Printing Costs of Legal Tender: Ministry of Finance Will Request the Central Bank to Reply Within Five Days

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 3] At a meeting of the Finance and Economic Committee of the Legislative Yuan on July 3, legislator Jian Gongsan questioned Liang Ping, Director of the Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank, who was present: (1) Is it true that the printing cost of each legal tender note is rumored to be US$0.085, equivalent to 340,000 legal tender? (2) Is it true that someone solicited handling fees during the printing of legal tender? (4) What is the procedure for issuing legal tender? Who has the final decision-making power? Director Liang immediately replied: The printing cost of legal tender is definitely not as high as rumored, and the issuance must be submitted to the president for approval. Legislator Jian expressed dissatisfaction with Liang's reply. Finally, Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan stood up and said that the above three questions would be forwarded by the Ministry of Finance to the Central Bank for a response within five days.

[Reuter's Dispatch from Nanjing, July 3] If the printing cost of legal tender printed in the United States is converted into legal tender at the black market rate, each note would reach 40,000 legal tender. According to Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan, a certain version of legal tender printed in the United States costs US$9.45 per thousand notes, and the cheaper ones cost US$5.50 per thousand notes.

### President Weng Sends Letters to Two Ministers of Friendly Parties, Urging Them to Take Office in the Capital Immediately, and Also Inviting Two Political Commissioners to Assume Their Duties Early

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 3] President Weng of the Executive Yuan, noting that the Ministers of Agriculture and Forestry and Industry and Commerce have not yet formally taken office, which has inevitably led to a standstill in ministerial affairs, specially sent letters to Ministers Zuo and Chen on July 2, urging them to take office. The original letter stated in brief: "Since the implementation of the Constitution, it has been more than a month since the Executive Yuan began operations. I admire the knowledge and am delighted to have the opportunity to work with you, two brothers, as you continue to serve as Ministers of Agriculture and Forestry and Industry and Commerce. At this time when the country is facing difficulties, I especially hope that we can support each other and work together. I sincerely hope that you will take office and work together to promote progress, arriving at the ministry before the 5th of this month, and also hope that you will invite Zhenwen and Shuming to assume their duties early to facilitate official business."

### Chen Bulei's Letter to Li Huang

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 3] Mr. Chen Bulei was in Shanghai last week and sent a letter to Mr. Li Huang of the China Youth Party on the morning of July 1. On July 3, a reporter from this newspaper visited Mr. Chen, who showed him a draft of the letter and said that he had made his best efforts for the cooperation of the three parties and now only hoped for understanding from the friendly party and had nothing else to say. The original letter is recorded as follows:

Elder Brother Youchun, I respectfully address you. Yesterday (the 30th) at 4:00 PM, I received a long-distance call from Nanjing, relayed by Brother Hong Lanyou, stating your public instructions, roughly that the new Executive Yuan has been established for a full month, and the Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry and Industry and Commerce urgently need someone to preside over them. The central government's expectations are pressing. Because I am more familiar with friends of your party, I am specially instructed to humbly present the situation, earnestly requesting that Brothers Shunsheng and Qitian must graciously go to Beijing to take office before July 5, and the two political commissioners of your party should also go to Beijing at the same time to comfort the hopes of those inside and outside the government. As for the issue of legislators, I will still do my best to find a solution, but progress on this matter is particularly difficult. I only hope for your understanding and that you will not treat the issue of legislators and participation in the Executive Yuan as one and the same. I have caught a cold and am unable to visit, but the promotion of cooperation among the three parties is something I sincerely pray for. Now that Chiang Kai-shek and the central government's expectations are so pressing, and the situation is difficult and the economy is turbulent, I humbly believe that today is the time for us to set aside our differences and dedicate ourselves to the country. I specially present the main points of the Beijing telegram in a letter, earnestly requesting that you urge the friends of your party's central committee in Shanghai to immediately persuade Brothers Zuo and Chen to go to Beijing to take office as scheduled so that the political affairs of the two ministries can be actively promoted and the key plans of the Executive Yuan can be collectively discussed, which would not only be fortunate for the overall situation but also be of great benefit to the entire cooperation issue. In the past month, I have followed the gentlemen of our party and originally thought of contributing to the cooperation issue, but my heart is willing, but my strength is insufficient, and I have not contributed much. I ask myself with shame, but I rely on knowing you well. I once again express my sincerity, and the power to turn things around depends entirely on your wisdom. I hope that you and the gentlemen of your party will truly benefit from it.

### Wu Tiecheng and Chen Bulei Issue Written Statements

Hoping that People of the Youth Party Will Participate in the Executive Yuan

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 3] Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and Chen Bulei, Acting Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee, recently issued the following written statements:

Regarding the issue of cooperation between our party and the China Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, we still hold the original intention of the past during the constitutional period. We have previously issued statements inviting them to participate in the cooperation. We are grateful that people from both friendly parties have responded with sincerity and sensitivity. First, they participated in the Control Yuan, and then they presented candidates to the President for the Grand Justices of the Judicial Yuan and the Examination Committee members of the Examination Yuan for consideration and approval. All these facts show that the spirit of unity among our three parties for the country is not only consistent but also increasing, which is gratifying. However, the Executive Yuan is the center of administration, and the political commissioners of both friendly parties have not yet participated to this day. The Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry and Industry and Commerce are particularly important at this time when production and construction urgently need to be developed and the social economy urgently needs to be stabilized. President Weng has already sent letters urging the two ministers to formally take office as soon as possible. We sincerely hope that people from both friendly parties will consider the difficulties of the current situation, fulfill their national salvation duties, and resolutely participate so that political affairs will not be affected. As for the legislators already elected by both friendly parties, we also hope that they will arrive at the Legislative Yuan early to express their opinions and discuss matters with the legislators of our party and non-partisan legislators to facilitate the progress of constitutional government. As for the issue of legislators, we will continue to work hard to seek a solution. The three parties united sincerely during the War of Resistance and the Constitutional era, which has a long history. Today is the time for us to carry out our original aspirations and serve the country. We sincerely hope that people from both parties will respond in unison to satisfy the general hope and the expectations of the central government.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, July 3] The President's memorandum on the list of 17 nominated Grand Justices and 19 Examination Committee members was delivered to the Ling Yuan on the afternoon of the 3rd.

### Legislative Yuan Finance and Banking Committee Decides: In Principle, Supports Currency System Reform; Meeting Set for the Morning of the 8th for Further Discussion

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The Legislative Yuan's Finance and Banking Committee held a meeting on the morning of the 3rd to review two proposals: one submitted by Gu Hegao and others regarding the establishment of a Legal Tender Issuance Management Committee, and another submitted by Dang Jingyan and others urging the government to promptly implement currency system reform. Liu Jianqun chaired the meeting, with Xu Baiyuan, Deputy Minister of Finance, and Liang Ping, Director of the Central Bank's Issuance Bureau, also attending to provide explanations and answer inquiries. After discussion, the chairman summarized the committee members' opinions into the following three points: (1) All agreed on the necessity of establishing a Legal Tender Issuance Management Committee, but the method of establishment remains to be discussed. (2) Opinions were divided on whether to immediately cease issuance, requiring further study. (3) In principle, no one opposed currency system reform, but whether the Legislative Yuan should first establish principles and authorize the government to handle it within a time limit also requires detailed study. It was decided to reconvene the Finance and Banking Committee at 9:00 a.m. on the 8th for further discussion.

Xu Baiyuan's Report

At the meeting on the morning of the 3rd, the original proposers first provided explanations, followed by Xu Baiyuan's report: (1) Regarding Legal Tender Issuance Management: Since the government implemented the legal tender in the 24th year (of the Republic, i.e., 1935), it established the Legal Tender Issuance Reserve Management Committee, with the headquarters in Shanghai and branches in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou, responsible for checking the reserve figures and issuance figures. However, as the War of Resistance began, the work gradually came to a halt, and it was formally discontinued in the 28th year (1939). The remedy was to formulate other measures to consolidate finance. In October of the 28th year, the Four Banks Joint Council was established, with the Four Banks Joint Office concurrently responsible for checking issuance, until the time of victory. Regarding the issue of whether to publicize the legal tender issuance figures, the government had discussed it several times but made no concrete decision. While publicizing issuance figures would have a positive impact on economic stability, it was feared that it might stimulate prices. The reason for the necessary increase in legal tender issuance was due to reduced tax revenue and enormous expenditures. The current general budget is under review in the Legislative Yuan. If the Legislative Yuan finds any inappropriate expenditures, it can reduce them accordingly. However, increasing revenue requires streamlining tax collection. The Ministry of Finance has already submitted four tax streamlining proposals to the Legislative Yuan for discussion, hoping they will be passed smoothly for implementation. As for the issue of currency system reform, it has been studied since the time of victory, but no concrete decision has been made. This is not due to excessive consideration by the government but because currency system reform should be done once and for all, not repeatedly. Secondly, currency system reform requires sufficient preparation. There are three possible reserves for reform: (1) foreign exchange, (2) commodities, and (3) hard currency, but none are currently adequately prepared, so it cannot be undertaken hastily. Xu specifically pointed out that the Soviet Union's recent currency system reform and the United States' past currency system reform were not discussed by parliament. The United States handled it directly by the president. If China wants to reform its currency system, it should also authorize the government to handle it to avoid affecting prices during discussions.

Opinions of the Legislators

After Xu's report, Liu Zhendong, Zhou Yongneng, Wang Mengyu, and others spoke one after another. Liu opposed publicly disclosing issuance figures and advocated for the establishment of a Legal Tender Issuance Management Committee. Wang advocated for immediately ceasing issuance and authorizing the government to handle currency system reform, but it must be implemented within the shortest possible time. Jian Guansan advocated for the establishment of a Legal Tender Issuance Management Committee, composed of the Premier of the Executive Yuan, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Budget, the Minister of Audit, and the Governor of the Central Bank, and the issuance figures should be reported to the Legislative Yuan. Huang Yuanbin advocated for currency system reform, but he was not comfortable authorizing the government, suggesting that the Legislative Yuan should formulate principles and hand them over to the government for execution. In the end, it was decided in principle to establish a Legal Tender Issuance Management Committee and, in principle, to support currency system reform. However, the method of establishment and reform will be discussed again at the Finance and Banking Committee meeting on the morning of the 8th.

### National General Budget

Has Entered the Stage of Group Review

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The second plenary meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Budget Committee was held in the auditorium on the morning of the 3rd, from 9:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m., in a closed-door session. Seventy-four committee members attended, chaired by Yin Shuxian. The meeting discussed and amended the review procedures for the national general budget for the 37th year (of the Republic, i.e., 1948) and amended and passed the review guidelines. The main points of the review guidelines are as follows: (1) Pay attention to budget balance. If there is a budget deficit, the principle should be to make up for it by streamlining tax revenue and saving expenses. (2) Pay attention to the streamlining of various important tax revenues. (3) Pay attention to increasing the surplus income of state-owned enterprises. (4) For superfluous agencies that have not gone through legislative procedures and have no budget for the first half of the year, their budgets should be eliminated. (5) For agencies that are too large and complex, their expenses should be reduced as much as possible. (6) Streamline state-owned enterprise agencies, reduce redundant personnel, and save expenses. As for the review procedures, they can be divided into stages: general review, group review, comprehensive review, joint review, and decision by the general meeting. It has now entered the group review stage, divided into seven groups. The budget committee members have each automatically identified a group to participate in the review.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 3rd] The Legislative Yuan's Budget Committee has scheduled the first joint meeting of all committees of the entire Legislative Yuan for the 5th to begin reviewing the general budget.

### Weekly Forum: Prospects for China's Shipping Industry

— Xu Xueyu

Seven-tenths of the Earth's surface is water, so water transportation developed the earliest, and it still occupies a very important position today.

China has many long rivers inland, and its coastline is over 11,000 nautical miles long. Logically, the shipping industry, which is responsible for water transportation, should be very developed. However, since the opening of the seas, although China's shipping industry has had nearly eighty years of history, our own shipping industry had only 500,000 tons of old ships before the war, and today it only has 1 million tons of ships with not very good performance. Compared to other shipping countries, it is truly insignificant. It is no wonder that foreigners, especially our British friends, criticize us, saying that our shipping industry (1) has no good policies, (2) has no good ships, (3) has no good management, and (4) has no good technical staff.

Indeed, for seventy or eighty years, we have not had a definite shipping policy. Since the beginning of shipping in the Tongzhi period of the former Qing Dynasty, apart from a few people like Li Hongzhang and Sheng Xuanhuai who could recognize the importance of shipping and tried their best to support shipping with the power of the state, most of the others only knew how to get rich by relying on the comprador system and did not understand what a shipping policy that considered the interests of the country and the nation was. It was not until the founding father Sun Yat-sen shouted the slogan of abolishing unequal treaties in the Three Principles of the People that everyone paid attention to the issue of shipping rights. The founding father proposed a target of more than 14.4 million tons of merchant ships in the Industrial Plan, and everyone felt the lack of merchant ships in our country. It was not until President Chiang Kai-shek led the War of Resistance to near victory that the unequal treaties were officially abolished and shipping rights were recovered. In his book "China's Destiny," President Chiang stipulated that the workload of 3 million tons of merchant ships should be completed in the first ten years, and the importance of shipping was gradually recognized by the Chinese people. However, due to long-standing problems, the actual politics of caring for and supporting shipping has not yet shown much practical results, and the entire shipping policy has not yet been specifically determined.

Our shipbuilding industry is not developed, and we cannot build the ships we need ourselves, which is the most difficult problem for China's shipping industry. After the war, we received many ships sold by the United States, Canada, and other countries, but these ships were either old pre-war ships over 30 years old or military transport ships built hastily during the war, and most of them were cargo ships. There were simply no real passenger ships. We have also contacted various countries to order new ships, but all countries are busy with their own post-war shipping recovery and have no spare capacity to build ships for us. Furthermore, all the magnificent passenger ships sailing internationally in all countries are directly or indirectly subsidized by the government for shipbuilding and navigation. Chinese people often blame our shipping industry for not having decent passenger ships, but please note that our shipping industry has never enjoyed the various preferential treatments enjoyed by foreign shipping industries.

Speaking of management issues, we feel that this is entirely due to the legacy of the comprador system for decades, so it has not been completely eradicated until now. The comprador system was created by the ethnic superiority of the British. They did not use the comprador system in their own country, but in colonies or semi-colonies, they believed that white people should not directly contact colored people, so everything was done through compradors. When China first started shipping, it imitated the British methods in China, so it also imitated the comprador system. Compradors are parasites of the shipping industry. They only know how to take advantage of the shipping industry to make money and will not care for the shipping industry. Therefore, the management of China's shipping industry has been severely affected. Until now, although the comprador system has been abolished, its poison has not been eradicated.

Our crew members are by no means inferior to others in terms of driving skills, but in terms of machinery, because there are now many new machines that our old ships do not have, they need to be further trained in their use. However, this is precisely the inevitable result of the past oppression of our shipping industry by foreign shipping industries, which prevented it from developing at any time. Since the victory of the War of Resistance, our ships have increased, many of which are equipped with high-speed diesel engines. After a short period of training, our crew members will soon be able to operate these complex machines independently, and there have never been any accidents. It can be seen that as long as our crew members have the opportunity to learn, it is absolutely not difficult to seek progress in technical skills.

Now, to develop China's shipping industry, we must accept the criticisms of foreigners and, focusing on the three shortcomings mentioned above, work hard to seek improvement from the government, society, and our own shipping industry, united from top to bottom.

We hope that the government will quickly follow the guidance on shipping in the Founding Father's Industrial Plan and President Chiang's "China's Destiny," and formulate clear and specific shipping policies, just like the U.S. Merchant Marine Act of 1937, and specially formulate a single law, specifying our ultimate goals for shipping, the implementation procedures, shipbuilding subsidies, navigation subsidies, and other basic national policies, so that those who implement them have something to follow. In fact, it is not only the United States that adopts shipping protection policies. All shipping countries, such as the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and pre-war Japan, Germany, and Italy, do so. Otherwise, relying solely on the shipping industry itself will never succeed. We admire the British government's various methods of protecting the shipping industry the most. For example, last year, the Hong Kong government ordered a batch of cotton yarn from our country. If the C.I.F. Hong Kong method was used to ship the goods to Hong Kong by Chinese ships, it would be at least three-quarters cheaper than using the F.O.B. Shanghai method and having British ships come to Shanghai to load the goods. However, in order to protect its own shipping industry, the Hong Kong government insisted on using the F.O.B. method and having British ships load the goods, even though it cost three-quarters more in freight. This shows that the Hong Kong government has a long-term vision and does not covet short-term benefits.

Recently, Schlenke's report continued, in which he advocated that by 1953, Japan should have 4 million tons of brand new merchant ships, averaging about one ton for every 22 people. "China's Destiny" stipulates that China should have 3 million tons of merchant ships in the first ten years, averaging about one ton for every 150 people, which is not much. However, we actually only have 1 million tons of old ships, and it is unknown how far we are from the goal of 3 million tons of new ships!

The most fundamental way to add new ships is to develop our own shipbuilding industry. Schlenke's report places special emphasis on the preservation of the Japanese shipbuilding industry. He plans to have Japan build all 4 million tons of new ships it needs itself in 13 years. If China wants to increase new ships in large quantities, it must do the same. If we order from other countries, we have to see if they have the spare capacity and whether they are willing to build for us. If we buy ready-made ships from other countries, it is questionable whether they are suitable, and other countries will not sell truly excellent ships. I remember that during the War of Resistance, the British Butterfield & Swire Company had two old ships (Kangding and Wanliu) sailing on the Sichuan River. At that time, the United Kingdom had already abandoned its navigation rights on the rivers in China. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company repeatedly negotiated to purchase them to meet the urgent need for transportation on the Sichuan River during the war. However, Butterfield & Swire Company would rather let them stop sailing and be wasted than sell them. This shows that it is not easy to buy ready-made ships.

The United States has absolutely no ambitions for China's shipping rights, which we firmly believe. However, recently, because foreign shipping companies that used to operate in China still want to make a comeback, they are using various means to undermine and slander China's shipping industry. American friends are often unknowingly deceived, and even some of our government and society are deceived. Therefore, we must take this opportunity to expose them. We sincerely hope that the United States, which has no fundamental conflict of interest with us in shipping and truly wants to help our economic recovery, can be as concerned as it is about the Japanese shipping industry and continue to give us spiritual and material assistance.

Shipping is of great importance to the country's entire economy. The United Kingdom relies on the foreign exchange income from shipping to maintain a balance of international payments. Recently, the United Kingdom has been fighting for all U.S. aid materials to be transported by British ships in order to reduce the expenditure of U.S. dollars, and the United States has agreed. However, half of the U.S. aid materials to China are stipulated to be transported by U.S. ships, and another quarter must be transported by ships from other countries. At most, Chinese ships can only transport a quarter of the total. The U.S. side has also proposed opening up Nanjing and Hankou. If Chinese ships are used to transport goods from Shanghai to Nanjing and Hankou, the freight will not need to be paid in U.S. dollars. If foreign ships transport the goods directly, this part of the freight will have to be paid from the U.S. aid foreign exchange. At present, the United Kingdom is indeed in urgent need of U.S. dollar foreign exchange, but since the United States can understand the needs of the United Kingdom, it can certainly understand that China's needs are even more urgent than those of the United Kingdom.

Regarding the issue of developing shipping to maintain the balance of international payments, our government does not seem to have a clear understanding either. For example, last year, our country sold 500,000 tons of iron ore from Hainan Island to Japan. Originally, the price of the ore was only US$6.50 per ton, but the freight was US$10 per ton. Together, our government could receive a total of US$8.25 million. In order to help the government earn foreign exchange, our shipping industry volunteered to charge freight in legal tender and send ships to transport the ore. Later, the British Aut company contacted the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo and charged a total of US$16.25 per ton for the ore and freight, but they were willing to pay our government US$7 per ton for the ore. This way, the freight was reduced by US$0.75 per ton, but our government, in order to earn an extra US$0.50 per ton for the ore, forgot about the freight loss of US$10 per ton. As a result, this business was completed by the British Aut company. All the U.S. dollars earned by the Aut company were purchased by the British government. In this way, although our government earned US$25,000 more on the ore price, it gave up US$5 million in freight to the British government! This was certainly due to the lack of coordination between various departments of our government, but from this alone, we can see the importance that the British government attaches to shipping income and the close relationship between the British government and its people. We hope that the government will learn from the United Kingdom in many ways in this regard!

In terms of management, our shipping industry should certainly step up its efforts to reorganize and reform. However, there are many issues that involve the entire political and social problems, which the shipping industry absolutely cannot do alone. We also hope that the government and society will give us strong support.

Regarding the technical skills of crew members, we will certainly do our best to provide new training to the existing crew members to meet current needs. At the same time, we also hope that the government will catch up quickly, strengthen shipping education, and quickly imitate advanced shipping countries to cultivate up-and-coming shipping talents and impart the latest knowledge and skills to them so that they can take on the task of developing shipping in the future.

Exchange of Notes

(1) Note from the United States Ambassador to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of China

Sir: With reference to the conclusion of the bilateral agreement for American aid to China, representatives of the Governments of the United States of America and the Republic of China have recently conducted negotiations, as a result of which the following understanding has been reached, which I hereby confirm:

1. During the period in which either the Government of the United States of America or the Government of the Republic of China participates in the occupation or control of any area of West Germany or the Free Territory of Trieste, the other Government shall apply to trade in goods with those areas the existing or subsequently amended provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of October 30, 1947, relating to most-favored-nation treatment.

2. The undertaking of the Government of the United States of America or of the Government of China under paragraph 1 above shall apply to trade in goods with any area referred to in that paragraph only to the extent and during the period in which that area accords reciprocal most-favored-nation treatment to the United States of America or China, respectively.

3. The undertaking prescribed in paragraphs 1 and 2 above is premised upon the fact that no effective or important tariff barriers are at present erected on imports into the areas referred to in those paragraphs. In the event that such tariff barriers should be erected, it is understood that this undertaking shall not prejudice the application of the principles of the Havana Charter for an International Trade Organization relating to tariff reductions on a reciprocal basis.

4. The Parties recognize that, in the West German areas referred to in paragraph 1 above, the lack of a uniform rate of exchange for the currency may have the effect of indirectly subsidizing exports from those areas to an extent which is difficult to ascertain precisely. It is understood that during the existence of this situation, and provided that consultation with the United States of America has failed to produce a mutually agreeable solution of the problem, the taking by the Government of China of action to levy a countervailing duty on imports of such goods equivalent to the estimated amount of such subsidy shall not be regarded as inconsistent with the undertakings set forth in paragraph 1 above in the event that the Government of China determines that such subsidy is causing or threatening material injury to an established domestic industry or is materially retarding or threatening to materially retard the establishment of a domestic industry.

5. The undertakings in this Note shall continue in effect until January 1, 1951. In the event that, at least six months prior to January 1, 1951, neither Government has notified the other Government in writing of its intention that these undertakings shall terminate on that date, these undertakings shall continue in effect after that date until six months from the date of such notification.

I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration.

Respectfully yours,

To His Excellency Wang Shih-chieh, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China

J. Leighton Stuart (Signed)

### South Africa Severes Economic Ties, Protests Albania's Impudent Behavior, Names Nanus to Succeed in Sending Third Protest Note

[Our Dispatch] London, 3rd Broadcast: Albania, which has already severed trade relations with Yugoslavia, today ordered the Yugoslavian cultural and trade delegation to leave Albania within 48 hours. On the other hand, the Yugoslavian Foreign Ministry has lodged a strong protest with Albania regarding its continued trade relations, arguing that Albania's actions have violated international law.

[United Press London, 3rd] Belgrade Radio Broadcast: The Yugoslavian official news agency "Tanyug" reported on the 3rd that Albania has severed economic relations with Yugoslavia. Albania has abolished the currency and tariff alliance treaty signed with Yugoslavia and demanded that Yugoslavians assisting in the country's construction withdraw within 48 hours. This action was announced in two notes sent by Tirana, the Albanian capital, to Yugoslavia on June 30th and July 1st. According to a telegram from the Yugoslavian capital on the evening of the 2nd, Albania has stopped exporting oil and other goods to Yugoslavia and halted railway construction between the two countries. Since the end of the war, Albania has effectively become a satellite state of Yugoslavia within the broad organization of Eastern European communist countries. This action appears to have been prompted by the Cominform's statement against the Yugoslavian Communist Party. A Yugoslavian Communist Party communiqué revealed that it had warned Albania that this action would undermine the treaty of friendship and mutual assistance between the two countries, and that Albania "must bear responsibility for the consequences arising from this action."

[Reuter London, 3rd] According to a Belgrade radio broadcast, Yugoslavia yesterday sent three threatening notes to Albania, protesting Albania's support for the Cominform's "insulting" and "crude" attacks on Marshal Tito. The notes were strongly worded, almost like an ultimatum, and were issued hours after the Yugoslavian Communist Party directly appealed to Stalin to rescind the Cominform's condemnation of Tito and his associates.

The three Yugoslavian notes to Albania: the first note demanded punishment for Albanians who "insulted" Tito, tore down his photos, and took actions to "damage Yugoslavia's reputation." If such "impudent behavior" continues, Yugoslavia cannot be responsible for the consequences.

The second note protested the Albanian government's order to stop the construction of the railway jointly built by Albania and Yugoslavia to the Albanian-Yugoslavian border, and the prohibition of importing minerals jointly mined by Albania and Yugoslavia in Albania, as well as oil produced in Albania, into Yugoslavia. In addition to demanding that the Albanian government rescind this order, the Yugoslavian government also requested that Albania send representatives to Yugoslavia to negotiate the differences between the two countries. The third note protested Albania's order for the immediate return of Shinnick (Director of the Political Department of the Yugoslavian Army) stationed in Albania. The note also stated that the attitude of the Albanian Army Chief of Staff, Major General Baroque, in defaming Yugoslavia and its leaders was "vulgar."

### Britain and the United States Closely Monitor the Development of Soviet-Yugoslav Relations, Hoping that the Danube Conference Can Be Convened as Scheduled

[United Press London, 3rd] Western officials are now watching the Stalin-Tito rift. Over the past week, Tito and his Yugoslavian Communist Party followers have resisted the Kremlin in the strongest possible terms. In addition, Tito is also engaged in incessant disputes with his two close neighbors, Bulgaria and Albania. The second step in the Yugoslavian crisis awaits the Soviet Union. How will the Kremlin deal with Tito, who was once a favorite but is now an enemy? Britain and the United States are at least temporarily adopting a "non-interference" attitude, waiting for Moscow to "clean up" Tito and heal the new wounds before speaking.

[United Press Washington, 2nd] Secretary of State Marshall stated at a press conference today that the State Department is closely monitoring developments regarding the Yugoslavian issue, but it is not yet convenient to formally express an opinion. Marshall denied reports from abroad that Tito had "suggested" that he could abandon Yugoslavia's claims to the port of Trieste in exchange for American economic aid. Marshall said that there was no such suggestion. In answering questions, Marshall stated that the State Department had not received reports from Greek observers indicating any change in Yugoslavia's support for Greek guerrillas resisting government forces. Marshall reiterated that the United States is continuing its preparations to participate in the Danube Conference to be held in Belgrade on July 31st and will not suspend it due to the dispute between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.

[Reuters London, 2nd] Following Secretary of State Marshall's statement, Britain has suggested that the British, American, Soviet, and French ambassadors in Belgrade invite Marshal Tito to issue invitations to hold the Danube Conference. Political figures believe that the Soviet Union's response to this move can prove whether the rift between Belgrade and Moscow also affects foreign policy.

### Britain and Yugoslavia Sign Trade Agreement

[Agence France-Presse London, 2nd] Britain and Yugoslavia signed an agreement in London today, under which Yugoslavia will supply timber worth £2 million, transported by British and Yugoslavian ships, to Britain.

### Yugoslavia Expels American Reporter

For Publishing Defamatory Reports

[Reuters Belgrade, 3rd] The Yugoslavian Ministry of Information announced that an American reporter from the British Telegraph Agency had published a defamatory report, alleging that a communist group at the University of Belgrade had announced a resolution opposing the Central Committee of the Yugoslavian Communist Party's statement on the Cominform declaration. The Yugoslavian government has revoked his right to reside in Yugoslavia. Several foreign newspapers, such as the Czech newspaper Truth, have reprinted this report. In fact, the declaration by the staff of the University of Belgrade was a rejection of the Cominform's accusations against the Yugoslavian Communist Party.

### Three Powers Maintain Contact to Deal with the Berlin Crisis

[Reuters Washington, 2nd] President Truman discussed the Berlin crisis with Secretary of State Marshall and other cabinet members for over an hour today, with Marshall reporting in detail on the steps taken by the three powers in the Berlin crisis.

[Reuters Washington, 2nd] Secretary of State Marshall refused to discuss the Berlin crisis when he received reporters today, which disappointed the two hundred or so reporters present. However, Reuters learned that he is consulting with the chairmen of the Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees on drafting plans to counter the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin. Marshall recently spent eleven days in the hospital for a physical examination. He said that he would return to the hospital for about one or two days on Saturday and then be discharged. While in the hospital, he will remain in close contact with the Berlin situation. Judging from Marshall's words, there will likely be no major developments before the weekend. The State Department and the U.S. Ambassador to Britain exchange four or five telegrams daily.

### Robertson Writes to Soviet Commander-in-Chief, Demanding Lifting of Berlin Blockade; The Three Powers Will Not Take Diplomatic Action Before Receiving a Reply

[Our Dispatch] New York, 3rd Broadcast: General Clay, the commander of the U.S. forces in Germany, General Robertson, the commander of the British forces, and a French officer met with Soviet Commander Sokolovsky for twenty minutes today in a final effort to resolve the Berlin crisis.

[United Press London, 3rd] The West began to spend the weekend in a relaxed mood on the 3rd, but all felt that next week may be a showdown with the Soviet Union over the Berlin issue, and also hinted at the fate of Yugoslavian Marshal Tito. It is understood that after a week of continuous consultations, Britain, the United States, and France have decided on a joint course of action. The first step was a letter from Robertson, the British military governor in Germany, to Sokolovsky on the morning of the 3rd, proposing a new discussion of the Berlin crisis. If Sokolovsky refuses the request and refuses to lift the siege of Berlin, the second step would be a strong protest from the three countries to Moscow, although its wording is firm and clear, it is not an ultimatum. External spokespersons hinted that no new diplomatic moves would occur before Sokolovsky's reply or prolonged lack of a reply.

[Reuters Berlin, 3rd] Western allies today are awaiting the Soviet Union's response to Britain's suggestion to discuss the Berlin situation with them. General Robertson, the commander of the British forces, wrote to Soviet Commander Sokolovsky this morning, requesting the immediate opening of road traffic between Berlin and Helmstedt, in the British zone, the regular resumption of railway traffic between Berlin and Helmstedt, and a guarantee that there would be no further obstruction of inland vessels traveling to Berlin. Robertson's letter stated, "I have received your letter of June 29th. I understand that the restrictions on the movement of German people between the Soviet zone and West Germany are temporary measures to protect the currency situation in your zone pending the implementation of a new currency system in your zone. I am pleased to hear that you have approved the movement of Germans holding transit passes between West Germany and the Soviet zone. I also understand that you are doing your best to repair the railway between Berlin and West Germany in order to restore freight transport before the food situation in West Berlin becomes critical. However, I hope you can inform me of the date of restoration. I would like to inform you that the movement of inland vessels is still not smooth, and I hope you can investigate and not interfere. Regarding road traffic between Berlin and Helmstedt, you have cited currency issues as a reason. I believe that opening the road will not harm the currency system in your zone, and I hope that traffic on that line can be restored immediately. I suggested on the 26th of last month that we discuss the use of a four-power controlled currency system in Berlin. This suggestion remains valid. However, the most important thing is to restore transport between Berlin and West Germany, so that the people of Berlin can live their normal lives. I am very willing to discuss with you the date and method of restoring traffic."

### Japanese House of Representatives Passes Budget Bill; Ashida Cabinet Initially Overcomes Difficulties; Democratic Liberal Party Will Propose a Vote of No Confidence

A compromise was reached to increase them by 250 percent.

[United Press Tokyo, 3rd] The Japanese Senate passed the budget bill at 4:30 a.m. on the 3rd, and the cabinet crisis has passed. The Democratic Liberal Party led the opposition to this budget and stated that they would propose a vote of no confidence in the government at the last session of the Diet on the 5th. Members who opposed the budget stated that the budget bill requires a large increase in tax rates and forces commodity prices to rise, which will inevitably cause suffering to the masses. General observers believe that the consequences of the budget bill will inevitably lead to a sharp increase in prices, and labor will also demand higher wages.

### Bernadotte to Announce Palestinian Peace Plan Today; Arab League Has Submitted Reply to Bernadotte

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 3rd] As the four-week truce in the Holy Land is about to expire in six days, United Nations diplomats are awaiting United Nations mediator Count Bernadotte to formally announce the contents of his proposals for long-term peace in Palestine, which aim to secure peace between the Arab and Israeli sides.

The Count has made arrangements to have his peace proposals released simultaneously by the mediation departments in Rhodes, Cairo, Tel Aviv, and Lake Success. The time is 18 hours Greenwich Mean Time (Shanghai Daylight Saving Time Monday morning at 2 a.m.). It is feared that Bernadotte may also simultaneously announce the replies of the Arab and Jewish sides to his proposals. The possibility of both sides accepting the proposal is almost zero.

### Marshall Disapproves of U.S.-Turkey Treaty; U.S. Fleet Visits Turkey

### U.S.'s Latest Radio Can Be Used Without Vacuum Tubes; Metal Balls as Big as Match Heads Can Amplify Power

[Associated Press New York, 2nd] Bell Telephone Company here has newly invented a type of radio that does not use vacuum tubes. Its central part is a small amount of metal, as big as a match head, and has the same effect as a vacuum tube. The design of this machine seems to be able to be further reduced in size, but whether it can be shrunk to the size of a watch is not yet known. This machine does not have lights or heat when turned on, and uses less current than a flashlight requires. However, it is still in the testing phase and cannot be launched immediately. The scientists at Bell Company, who manufactured this machine, have discovered a new principle of particle science, which can be applied to other aspects besides wireless motors. The machine does not use vacuum tubes, but small metal cylinders the size of shoelace tips, with a metal ball the size of a match head at the bottom. The mystery lies in this. If the current input and output lines are connected to this ball in the correct position, they can amplify the power. The gap is only the thickness of a piece of paper. The wires are also as thin as hair, and all that is inside the metal tube is this, but the action of the electrons does not cause it to wear out. This small metal ball not only expands power like a vacuum tube, but also emits radio waves, and has other important functions in addition to the function of a vacuum tube.

### Clearing Wartime Lend-Lease Debts: U.S.-Soviet Negotiations in Progress; U.S. Demands Return of 31 Ships

[Reuters Washington, 2nd] Marshall revealed at a press conference today that the Soviet Union's recent note regarding negotiations on lend-lease debts between the two countries is being studied by the State Department. The United States is demanding that the Soviet Union return three icebreakers and twenty-eight gunboats borrowed from the United States under the Lend-Lease Act during the war. The patented inventions enjoyed by American companies that were supplied to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease Act during the war have also been requested for compensation by the United States from the Soviet Union. Regarding the American merchant ships borrowed by the Soviet Union, eight have been returned to the United States, and the disposal of the remaining eighty-seven is still under negotiation. In general, the United States is asking the Soviet Union to settle a total of $11 billion in lend-lease debts, the terms of which are the same as the settlement agreements concluded by the United States with other major countries participating in the Lend-Lease program. The United States does not demand payment for war materials lent to the Soviet Union for joint combat efforts before Japan surrendered, but for civilian materials supplied to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease Act, which still existed when Japan surrendered and can obviously still be used after the war, the United States believes that the Soviet Union should give the United States reasonable compensation.

### Adjustment of Water, Electricity, and Gas Prices; Increase Rate Close to Double for Most; Phone Company's Demand is Too High, Not Accepted by Public Utilities Bureau

[Our Dispatch] The new prices for public utilities in this city for July were strictly reviewed by the Public Utilities Bureau yesterday, inviting representatives from various companies, and submitted to the Mayor for approval. They will be implemented from today (the 4th) onwards, based on meter readings. For the telephone category, the new prices could not be approved because the company insisted on a too high increase rate, which the Public Utilities Bureau could not accept. The new prices for water, electricity, and gas are as follows:

Water (per cubic meter) Compared to last month: Retail Water Stations

British and French Companies: 98,000 yuan, increase of 175% 35,500 yuan

Zhabei, Inland, Pudong: 128,000 yuan, increase of 175% 46,600 yuan

Gas (per 100 cubic feet) Compared to last month: increase of 285,000 yuan, increase of 171%

According to Director Zhao, the increase rate of various factors related to public utilities is: diesel is 250 percent, coal is about 190 percent, foreign exchange is 413 percent, the cost of living index is 111 percent, and the hardware index is 124 percent. Based on the above figures, various public utilities should increase by about 200 to 300 percent. The prices approved by the city government this time are lower than other factors, so it will definitely not lead to price increases. For electricity rates, in order to encourage energy conservation, the increase rate below 30 degrees is particularly low. In addition, for the 130 retail water stations throughout the city, because they are related to the drinking water of the common people, they will still be supplied at the June water price. In addition, the 80 summer tap water supply stations, in addition to the French company's area being open all day for free, the rest of the companies originally opened for two hours a day, and have been ordered to open for six hours, to benefit the drinking water of the common people.

### Public Utilities Fuel Oil Approved for Early Exchange Settlement; Director Zhao Proposes Seven Demands, National Bank President Accepts Three

Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau, and Senators Jiang Hao, Ma Junshuo, Li Wenjie, Shao Yongsheng, and others, for the issue of foreign exchange settlement for public utilities, visited President Yu of the Central Bank yesterday at 11:00 AM to discuss the matter. Zhao Zengjue, representing the city's eight major public utilities companies, put forward seven demands: (1) Foreign exchange needed for one month's fuel oil should be settled in advance in one lump sum. (2) Import tariffs on fuel and surcharges from oil companies should be cleared in one payment at the time of oil withdrawal. (3) The difference between the exchange settlement certificate and the listed price should be temporarily advanced by the Central Bank and repaid by the companies in installments. (4) The price of coal allocated to public utilities should be maintained for at least one month without adjustment. The 15,953 tons of coal already sold by the Central Bank to various public utilities companies should be calculated based on the wharf delivery price when shipped from Qinhuangdao in June, plus the new freight and miscellaneous fees of the Fuel Management Committee in July, in order to alleviate the increase in coal prices. (5) The advance oil payments and other working capital required by each company should be borrowed from the Central Bank. (6) The raw material alum needed by the waterworks should be approved for foreign exchange settlement for import. (7) The monthly adjustment date of the selling price of public utilities should be advanced as much as possible. President Yu answered each of the above points one by one, accepting the first, third, and fourth items. The second item, the issue of oil tariffs, was notified to Deputy Tax Commissioner Ding Guitang for handling. The fifth item, borrowing, was not approved. The sixth item, alum import, is under the jurisdiction of the Transportation Management Committee. The seventh item, advancing the adjustment of selling prices, should be handled by the municipal government at its own discretion.

### Hotel Room Rates Approved for a 90% Increase

The price of hotel rooms in this city, which was approved by the Social Affairs Bureau on the 19th of last month, has only been two weeks to date. Due to high prices, the labor and management of the industry have decided to adjust it again, increasing it by 160% of the original price, requesting the Social Affairs Bureau to approve it. The Social Affairs Bureau convened emergency meetings with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, the Hotel Industry Association, the Inn Industry Association, and the Hotel Workers' Union. As a result, it was decided to approve an increase of 90%, which will be implemented starting tomorrow.

### President Weng Cables Reply to the Senate; Mayor's Resignation is Retained

After Mayor Wu announced in his speech at the closing ceremony of the sixth general meeting of the Senate that he had telegraphed the Executive Yuan to firmly request his resignation, all sectors of the city were shocked. It is now known that the Senate, based on the resolution of the General Assembly, telegraphed the Central Government to request Wu's continued service. Yesterday, it received a reply cable from President Weng of the Executive Yuan. The original cable is as follows: "To Speaker Pan Gongzhan and Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing of the Municipal Senate: Your telegram of this afternoon is noted. Mayor Wu Guozhen of Shanghai has telegraphed to request his resignation, and this Yuan has already sent a telegram to retain him. Reading your telegram, it is clear that the Senate unanimously persuades him to stay, and public opinion is clear. A special telegram is sent to you for your information."

### Wage Payment Method Agreed Upon with Two Measures

[Report from our newspaper] The Labor-Management Evaluation Committee convened a small group meeting yesterday to study the wage payment method after the publication of the employees' cost of living index twice a month.

(2) For those using the previous month's index, the first half of the month will be calculated based on the index at the end of the previous month, and the second half of the month will be calculated based on the index on the 15th of the current month. However, if there is an agreement between labor and management in the past, that agreement will still be followed.

Mr. Song, in view of the large number of Kuomintang members who have died in the War of Resistance and the Suppression of Bandits, and whose families are lacking care and living in hardship, which is pitiful, initiated the raising of a Mutual Aid Fund for Party members and is willing to donate all of his personal shares in this company invested in Yangtze Electric, Huainan Mining Railway, and Hanzhen Jiji Water and Electricity Company. Mr. Song subsequently telegraphed me to ask whether the company's entire share could be unanimously donated. I replied that this move was deeply pleasing to me, and I personally expressed my great approval, and I would also donate all of my personal shares. As for other shareholders, please consult with them nearby and handle it according to law." Li stated: "Donating wealth to provide relief is a righteous act. Everyone present is a social pioneer who is eager to help the public. I trust that you will sympathize with this and hope that all shareholders will provide instructions." After the report was completed, discussions began. Shareholder Qian Xinzhi was the first to stand up and advocate that everyone should unanimously donate all the shares of the three companies, so as not to let Mr. Song and Mr. Kong have all the credit. The remaining shareholders also spoke one after another, all willing to sacrifice their personal rights. As a result, the principle of full donation was passed, and the company sent letters to solicit written opinions from the absent shareholders, which were collected within two days and handed over to the board of directors for a decision on implementation.

### Tongfeng Firm Swallows Resident Rice; Nearby Residents Appeal for Impartial Investigation and Punishment

[Report from our newspaper] Amidst the soaring rice prices, the Tongfeng Firm Rice Store at 77 Ouyang Road in this city has actually engaged in the malfeasance of refusing to sell household rice. Yesterday, residents in the nearby area specially submitted a request to the Municipal Senate, appealing to the Senate to uphold justice and hoping that the relevant authorities of the city would conduct an impartial investigation and severely punish the firm so as to serve as a warning to illegal merchants. The malfeasance listed in the petition included the following: The Tongfeng Firm Rice Store recently received a large batch of American relief rice, which should have been distributed to residents in the area in accordance with regulations. However, when residents went to buy household rice, the store refused to sell it, claiming that it was sold out. The residents believed that the store was intentionally swallowing the household rice, so they secretly paid attention and discovered that the store was secretly transporting the American rice to other places. They immediately reported the matter to the North Sichuan Road Police Station, which sent officers to detain the household rice in question. However, the owner of the store was skilled at manipulation, running to the door of someone powerful to find a way to transfer the American rice back in the hope of concealing the evidence. At the same time, he also planned to falsely accuse the nearby residents, etc. It is said that the authorities concerned are conducting a strict investigation into the case. The Municipal Senate also forwarded the case to the People's Food Allocation Committee yesterday, requesting clarification and handling.

### Good News Aboard the Qiujin Steamer A Little Citizen is Born at Sea China Merchants Bureau Grants Permanent Free Passage

[Report from our newspaper] The Qiujin, a special express steamer of the China Merchants Bureau's Beiyang Line on the Shanghai-Tianjin route, returned to Shanghai from Tianjin on the 29th of last month. On the 1st of this month, at 4:45 PM, as it entered the Tongsha area of the Yangtze River, a female passenger named Gui Liu Zhiyu in the third-class cabin suddenly gave birth to a boy. The captain reported the matter and ordered the crew to take care of her. As the ship was approaching Shanghai and about to enter the port, the captain telegraphed the head office. After receiving the telegram, the head office ordered the service team to prepare a car to meet her at the Sixth Wharf for transport to the hospital. At 7:00 PM that afternoon, the express steamer arrived at the port, and Chen Jinxiang and Jin Ciquan of the service team boarded the ship and transported the mother and child to Gongji Hospital, now residing in Ward 245, both mother and child are healthy. It is said that the parturient Gui Liu Zhiyu is the wife of Mr. Gui, deputy director of the news office of the New First Army stationed in Shenyang. Because she was nearly full-term, she was accompanied by Zhang Changqi, battalion commander of the Paoqiu camp, from Shenyang to Peiping by plane, and from Peiping to Tianjin, and then took a boat to Shanghai to give birth in Nanjing. She had asked a doctor for an examination in Tianjin. According to the doctor, there were still seven days until delivery, and it was estimated that it would not take seven days to travel by boat from Tianjin to Shanghai and from Shanghai to Nanjing, so she took the Qiujin express steamer. Unexpectedly, the ship was inevitably bumpy on the sea, causing slight vibrations, so she gave birth on the ship before reaching her destination. Chen and Jin of the China Merchants Bureau's service team brought flowers to visit the hospital the next day, and the parturient was extremely grateful. It is also heard that the baby will be named Qiujin, and the bureau expressed that it would give special preferential treatment to this baby born at sea and would give him free passage on the Qiujin steamer forever in the future.

### The Fire Case on Henan Road Transferred to the District Procuratorate for Investigation The Report Lists Four Conclusions Relevant Agencies Cannot Evade Negligence

[Report from our newspaper] The case of the dangerous goods explosion in the Zhongfa warehouse on Henan Road on the 5th of last month, which caused a major fire, many deaths and injuries, and property losses of 221.4 billion yuan, has been thoroughly investigated by the Municipal Police Bureau. The complete case files and reports were transferred to the District Procuratorate for investigation a few days ago. It is understood that the Fire Department's report lists four conclusions: (1) The main cause of the explosion and fire was waste film of nitrocellulose, which was privately transported and stored without the permission of the police bureau. The Zhongfa warehouse and the Dongcheng Company should be responsible for this. The Huangpu Police Sub-bureau, which failed to investigate and inspect the private transportation of dangerous goods, cannot evade the blame for negligence. (2) The management of the warehouse is under the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Bureau. The Zhongfa warehouse has joined the trade association and has applied to the Finance Bureau for a license twice. The Finance Bureau transferred the case to the Public Utilities Bureau for verification and handling, so the Public Utilities Bureau should also be responsible. (3) The police bureau's notification of improvement was aimed at preventing the spread of fire when matches and sulfur burned. Even if the warehouse complied with the improvement, it could not prevent the explosion of privately stored waste film. However, the supervising department failed to review the notified improvement items. Jiang Zhishang, chief of the First Section of the Fire Department of the Police Bureau, should be disciplined to warn against negligence. (4) In this tragedy, Zhou Zhaoxiang, director of the Fire Department, requested severe punishment for himself due to inadequate prevention.

Regarding Zhou Zhaoxiang, Jiang Zhishang, and others, they have previously received administrative penalties. Who in the police bureau should bear criminal responsibility? Who in the Zhongfa warehouse should bear criminal responsibility? Zhongfa has not yet obtained a formal license to store dangerous goods. Who should be responsible? The report did not mention these few most important points, which are the most important points in this case. The case is being handled by Prosecutor Ding Chuanen of the District Procuratorate. It is reported that the hearing will be opened soon for investigation.

### Authorities Strictly Monitor the Market Surprise Spot Checks on Check Clearing Military and Police Launch Large-Scale Operations Tomorrow

Jiang Jingguo Visits Xuan Tiewu to Discuss Stabilizing Commodity Prices

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, after the "six bottoms" period passed customs, the relevant authorities strictly implemented economic inspection work to prevent price fluctuations. In addition to military and police personnel strictly monitoring the market to prevent speculation, the Gold Control Bureau also dispatched thirty groups of inspectors yesterday morning to conduct surprise inspections of various banks and firms, paying attention to their check clearing. However, one item, prices, has not yet fallen back. Rice merchants have been in a bitter struggle because the price limit is lower than the cost, and no transactions have been seen inside or outside the market. The rise in cotton cloth yarn is still strong, and the prices of daily necessities are also firm. The rise in financial commodities is even more intense, and Chinese stocks have risen to the limit across the board. The main reason for the stability of prices yesterday should be attributed to the strict market monitoring by the authorities. Brokers in major markets are not allowed to trade with non-industry people. The daily trading volume and targets must be reported daily for verification. Violators will be severely punished. At the same time, in order to cooperate with the authorities' policy, the Central Bank ordered its agencies yesterday morning to sell off large amounts of materials and tighten credit. Judging from the current situation, prices may not rise sharply in the next few days.

According to a person in charge of the Garrison Headquarters, after the Tong Dynasty decided on five emergency measures to suppress and stabilize prices, they tested their edge on the 3rd and continued to make arrangements for "cracking down on speculation and capturing profiteers." He revealed that the military and police personnel executing the five emergency measures will launch large-scale operations on the 5th to eliminate man-made price increases.

Many People Detained and Punished According to the Police Bureau, the result of yesterday's full-day market monitoring was that Fu Zhicheng was found to be using an expired market license at the North Rice Market. Zhang Runfu and Yang Xiqing, two foreign stock brokers, were detained at the Dechang Securities firm in the Overseas Chinese Building. Xu Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaogen, two suspects of off-site trading, and Tao Ranren, Pan Siming, Fan Zhenhua, Jiang Weifu, and Hu Shuwei, fourteen intermediaries who did not carry transaction orders, were arrested in the cotton yarn market. All were taken to the bureau for interrogation and punished separately according to the severity of the circumstances in accordance with the Violation of Police Regulations Act.

After Jiang Jingguo was ordered to come to Shanghai on the 2nd, he discussed the issue of stabilizing prices in the Shanghai market with Xuan Tiewu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, on the 3rd. Jiang also conveyed President Liu's instructions on stabilizing prices in the Shanghai market. It is reported that the President is extremely concerned about the recent price fluctuations in the Shanghai market and is deeply angered by the arrogance of speculators. The central government is carefully drafting concrete plans to stabilize the entire economy, which will be announced and implemented soon. Prior to this, the President specially instructed the military and police personnel in Shanghai to jointly investigate those engaged in speculative profiteering, hoarding, raising market prices, and buying and selling gold notes on the black market with relevant agencies and to investigate the methods they used and whether they had backing. Once these elements are found to be based on evidence, they will be given the most severe punishment.

Two Female Passengers Carry Eight Hundred Million Yuan Order to Deposit in the Central Bank

Police and military personnel in this city established three sea, land, and air inspection teams yesterday to inspect passengers arriving in Shanghai. Anyone carrying more than 200 million yuan in cash was ordered to deposit it in the Central Bank. Each team was led by a lieutenant colonel officer sent by the Inspection Department of the Garrison Headquarters and was equipped with a squad of military police and police, jointly performing their duties with relevant agencies. On the 3rd, two female passengers who arrived in Shanghai by boat from Tianjin were found to be carrying more than 800 million yuan in cash and were ordered to deposit it in the Central Bank. The work of inspecting warehouses is currently under secret surveillance. To prevent the escape of materials from the warehouse, the garrison brigade of the garrison headquarters has sent personnel to strengthen inspections at various entrances and exits. After the registration deadline on the 6th, a universal inspection will be carried out, and tens of thousands of people will be dispatched at that time, including students.

Removing Intercom Telephones The Economic Section and Electrical Inspection Section of the Garrison Headquarters, together with the Military Police Regiment, the Economic Police of the Police Bureau, the Public Utilities Bureau, and other agencies, dispatched more than 50 people, divided into ten groups, to inspect intercom telephones in the Securities Building yesterday, removing a total of 47 intercom telephones, including 12 from Jiayu, 3 from Housheng, 2 from broker Wu Jingwen at No. 60, 3 from Chengda, 2 from Zhendachang, 4 from Tongfu, 7 from Wanxiang, 3 from Taichang, 5 from Zhonghe, 3 from Southeast Trust Company, 1 from Dachang, and 11 from a certain company. More than 500 yards of cable were also removed.

Economic investigators of the Garrison Headquarters, based on a tip-off, found that a company on Kangxi Road was suspected of operating a gold note black market and arrested two suspects, who are being interrogated in detail.

### The End of the Rainy Season is Near: Heavy Rain This Morning

[Our Newspaper's Report] Recently, we are in the late Meiyu season, coupled with the southwest tropical air mass covering the coastal area. The weather is humid and sultry, with an average temperature of about 93 degrees Fahrenheit. According to the meteorological joint report, a typhoon was discovered near 137 degrees east longitude and 15 degrees north latitude yesterday. However, due to the distance and its northwestward trajectory, the Chinese coast is unlikely to be affected. Last night, the low-pressure area in the Pacific Ocean moved westward, encountering a warm air current at 2:30 this morning, resulting in heavy rain. In addition, the rainfall during this year's Meiyu season is less than last year, so the average temperature is higher than last year. After "Leaving the Meiyu Season" on the 5th of this month (the old calendar's Minor Heat), the temperature may soar to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, so the truly scorching summer season is approaching soon. The forecast issued by the Central Meteorological Observatory is recorded below:

Yellow Sea: Sunny to cloudy and hot with haze, moderate variable winds, light waves, and morning fog along the coast.

Central China: Cloudy and hot, locally turning cloudy, moderate variable winds to calm.

Shanghai: Cloudy, still sunny, hot, with haze, moderate southwest to southeast winds.

East China Sea: Cloudy, hot, moderate southwest to southeast winds, coastal fog, moderate waves.

Three-day temperature: Minimum 27.2 degrees Celsius (81.0 degrees Fahrenheit), maximum 34.6 degrees Celsius (94.6 degrees Fahrenheit).

### Fraudulently Cashing Checks: Friend Accuses Fleeing Criminal

Ren Xiaming (aka Ren Hongqiao), residing at No. 1, Jihe Lane, Wengjia Lane, Nanshi, has no legitimate occupation. He usually carries a handgun and specializes in extorting relatives and friends. The number of victims is unknown. Last month, he privately carved a seal and used Ren Chongdao's name to have his son, Zu Yu, fraudulently obtain 8 million yuan from Lao Zhengxing Restaurant on Guangxi Road. Guo Jinsheng, the restaurant's accountant, discussed the matter with Ren Chongdao and reported it to the police station. Ren Zuyu was detained and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and a factual indictment. Unexpectedly, Ren Xiaming recently used a blank check from a defunct sub-branch of the Yu Ye Bank, forged his friend Liu Yuanmin's seal, filled in 650 million yuan, and colluded with Zhou Weiyan as the holder to extort Liu Yuanmin. Liu filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office, which sent Prosecutor Quan to summon Zhou to court for investigation. Zhou confessed to the fraud, stating that he was instigated by a woman named Li Weijun (aka Li Ying) and Ren Xiaming, and that he was merely being used by them, requesting leniency, etc. The bailiff was dispatched to No. 379, Changde Road, to arrest Li, but Ren had already escaped upon hearing the news. Yesterday, a second hearing was held, and Li was detained, and Ren Xiaming was being pursued for prosecution. It is said that Li Weijun and Ren Xiaming have a special relationship. Last month, it was reported that Ren Hongqiao (aka Xiaming), a member of the 16th branch of the Municipal District Party Department, claimed to be a Buddhist and wrote to the Municipal Government, intending to move the stone figures of the Wengzhong from Nanjing West Road to his home in Jihe Lane for worship. Interested parties visited his home and found only a small room, indicating ulterior motives.

### Robber on Beijing Road Resists Arrest, Injures Person

[Our Newspaper's Report] At approximately 11:40 PM last night, three robbers suddenly entered Shenchang Cigarette Paper Store at No. 58, Xiamen Road. One held a box cannon, and three gold rings were robbed before they fled. The store owner, Xu Xirui, shouted for help from upstairs. Many people were out enjoying the cool air, and several followed in pursuit. Two robbers fled north with the stolen goods, while one headed south. At the entrance of Xiang Sheng Automobile Company on Beijing Road, Ye Zuofu, a police officer from the Old Zha District, arrived after hearing the alarm, and together with Liu Miaofa and Yu Jinlong, who were enjoying the cool air, bravely apprehended the robber. The robber then took out a box cannon and fired, a bullet hitting Yu Qiyun (18 years old, residing at No. 864, Hongxing Lane, Nicheng Bridge, Beijing Road) in the back of the left foot. The robber was then taken to the Old Zha Police Station, where Chief Jiang interrogated him. He gave his name as Chen Jichao, 24 years old, from Haimen. He was immediately detained pending transfer to the court. The wounded person was immediately sent to Hongren Hospital.

### Coca-Cola Restricted: Watson's Submits Explanation

[Our Newspaper's Report] During the sixth general meeting of the Municipal Senate, Senator Zhang Ji and others proposed that Coca-Cola raw materials should be classified as luxury goods and restricted from import. The proposal was approved by the general meeting, and the review opinions of the Social Affairs Committee were sent to the municipal government for reference. Watson's Soda Company, the local Coca-Cola manufacturer in this city, specially submitted a document to the Municipal Senate yesterday to explain the matter, with the following key points: (1) Coca-Cola is sold in all countries except the Soviet-controlled area and is generally recognized as a common daily beverage. (2) The raw materials used by domestic soda factories all come from abroad. (3) Coca-Cola pays a very large amount of commodity tax every month, reaching 14 billion yuan in June of this year, plus the banquet donation and business tax of associated distributors, estimated at about 25 billion yuan. (4) The raw materials imported for Coca-Cola only account for 8% of the retail price. (5) Watson's Company is an organization operated by Chinese. (6) All machinery and equipment in the factory are invested by Chinese. Restricting the import of raw materials will seriously harm Chinese investment.

### The Significance of China's Maritime Day: Promoting Grand Oceanic Ideas, Strengthening the Construction of the Shipping Industry, Safeguarding National Shipping Rights, and Enhancing Overseas Relations

Yesterday (July 3rd) was China's first Maritime Day. Du Yong, Chairman of the National Shipowners Association, and all executive directors and supervisors published an article on "The Significance of China's Maritime Day," calling for the promotion of grand oceanic ideas, the strengthening of the construction of the shipping industry, the safeguarding of national shipping rights, and the enhancement of overseas relations. The words are earnest and valuable, and we specially reprint them as follows:

The Earth is the foundation of human culture and life. Of its total area of 196,940,000 square miles, the ocean—the ocean in the broad sense, including various forms of water surfaces such as rivers, lakes, and marshes—reaches 138,770,000 square miles, accounting for 70% of the total area. With such a vast water surface, human culture relies on it for exchange, and the shipping industry and fishery develop without limit. Because the ocean is the mother of culture and the source of national power, all countries attach special importance to marine affairs, including ocean, coastal, and inland river shipping and fishery, and give them various forms of encouragement. Countries such as the United States have designated Maritime Day to establish the concept of the ocean in the minds of the people. China's Bohai, Yellow, East, and South Seas have a total coastline of more than 10,000 nautical miles, controlling the hub of the Pacific West Coast's shipping routes to all parts of the world, and should have a very important position in marine affairs. Since the conclusion of the new treaty with Britain and the United States on February 12, 1942, the rights of coastal and inland river navigation have been recovered, and the focus of China's nation-building has obviously shifted more towards the ocean. It has been almost three years since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and the national shipping industry's efforts to develop marine affairs have achieved initial success; the people of the whole country have also gradually recognized the importance of the shipping industry. Therefore, at the inaugural meeting of the National Shipowners Association last year, representatives from all over the country unanimously decided to suggest that the government designate July 3rd of each year as China's Maritime Day, which was approved by the government. Today is the first Maritime Day, and celebrations are being held all over the country. We would like to take this opportunity to clarify the significance of Maritime Day: First,

Promoting Grand Oceanic Ideas: Looking back at the origins of civilization in Egypt, Phoenicia, Greece, and Rome, all were rooted in the ocean. Looking at the expansion of Britain, the United States, Norway, France, the Netherlands, and other countries, all relied on the shipping industry as a pioneer. In the 17th and 18th centuries, historically known as the Commercial Revolution, countries used ships to sail across the oceans to open up territories, and then established navies to show their power overseas. Before the war, Britain and its colonies, with 23 million tons of merchant ships, controlled the hegemony of the sea; during World War II, the United States, with a surge to 60 million tons of merchant ships, held the leading position in the Allied countries. History tells us that the country that is good at using the water surface will become strong. The shipping industry is the foundation of the country; with the shipping industry, shipping rights can be ensured; with sea control, territory can be ensured. The Chinese people's understanding of the ocean is not yet deep enough; China's ocean has just begun to be utilized. In politics, economics, and education, the development of marine affairs has not been made the center, as in advanced countries such as Britain and the United States. In the minds of many people, even some government officials, there is no concept of special emphasis and support for the shipping industry—they often regard the shipping industry as one of the thirty-six trades and regard shipping rights as the affairs of the shipping industry. This wrong concept has prevented China's shipping industry from rising, and the prosperity of the nation and the country cannot be formed. We commemorate Maritime Day, first of all, to promote grand oceanic ideas; we earnestly hope that the words "ocean" will be in the minds of 450 million compatriots. Second,

Strengthening the Construction of the Shipping Industry: In the Industrial Plan of the founding father of the nation, there are plans to build commercial and fishing ports throughout the country and a target of building 10 million tons of merchant ships. This is indeed a basic need for nation-building, and we should strive to achieve it. Now, the country only has one million tons of merchant ships, and it must reach at least three million tons within two years to be able to barely replace Japan's pre-war position in shipping in the Far East. We study the process of various countries developing their shipping industry: none of them has not been successfully built by the power of the state—shipbuilding materials are mostly tax-free; shipbuilding funds are mostly long-term, low-interest, or even interest-free national policy loans; the losses in navigation, whether due to higher costs or the impact of foreign ship competition, are mostly subsidized by the national treasury; the United States' spending in this area is very large. Although our government also intends to promote the construction of the shipping industry, there are still few practical measures similar to those mentioned above. A constructive shipping policy also needs to be established and implemented, and we hope that the government will pay attention to it. The national shipping industry will make its greatest efforts to meet the needs of the new China's shipping industry in terms of organization, management, technology, finance, and materials, in order to cooperate with national policies and facilitate transportation. Third,

Safeguarding National Shipping Rights: Shipping rights are an important part of national sovereignty. The recovery of coastal and inland river navigation rights is the result of fifty years of struggle by the whole country. Looking back at a series of unequal treaties since the Treaty of Nanjing between China and Britain in 1842, China's shipping rights have been constantly infringed. British and Japanese merchant ships have been active in China's territorial waters for a long time, overshadowing the host and preventing the growth of the country's fledgling shipping industry. In terms of national defense, economy, and shipping needs, it is necessary to safeguard national shipping rights. This protectionist policy has long been practiced by countries such as Britain, France, Japan, Italy, the Netherlands, and Norway, and the United States is especially sparing no expense in this regard. The 1937 US Merchant Marine Act clearly stated that the goal of US shipping policy is to build an appropriate number of merchant ship fleets to meet the needs of US domestic and overseas commerce. These ships must be built in the United States, wholly owned by Americans, crewed by Americans, and fly the American flag. It also stipulates shipbuilding price difference subsidies and navigation cost difference subsidies. Our country's shipping industry is still in its infancy, so how can we not learn from the United States?

One more point needs to be added: Recently, the US aid to China Act provides some assistance to our country's economy. Regarding the transportation of aid materials, even on overseas routes, the ships of the recipient country should be used as much as possible; and the transshipment on domestic routes should be undertaken by the ships of the recipient country. The Chinese shipping industry has long decided to prioritize the inland river transshipment of some US aid materials, giving them special preferential treatment and ensuring rapid convenience. Three years ago, a country that had been enjoying navigation privileges in China hoped that the Chinese government would allow foreign ships to navigate in China's coastal waters and open up inland river ports such as Nanjing and Hankou. This request conflicts with China's newly recovered shipping rights and has encountered strong opposition. To this day, it still has an unpleasant impression in the minds of the Chinese people. This time, the United States is helping China with great goodwill and deep friendship, and it will definitely take into account the Chinese people's belief in safeguarding their national shipping rights. If it cannot actively assist the revival of the Chinese shipping industry in the aid measures, at least it should avoid adverse effects in the passive aspect. Fourth,

Enhancing Overseas Relations: Most of the ocean belongs to the high seas. On the high seas, merchant ships of all countries can navigate freely. Therefore, merchant ships are international bridges. A country should establish an appropriate merchant ship fleet in order to develop overseas trade and cultural relations. There are many overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, and the business relationship is very deep. We should first open up Southeast Asian routes to connect with them; after that, the exchanges with European and American countries will also become closer and closer. The opening of European and American routes also needs to be actively carried out.

The issue of Japanese compensation and restrictions on merchant ship tonnage is attracting attention from all parties. To prevent Japan from becoming an aggressor again, its merchant ship tonnage must be restricted so that it does not exceed one million tons. Japan's coastline is shorter than China's, and merchant ships are the backing of the navy. If Japan is allowed to possess more merchant ships than China, it will inevitably threaten the safety of China and other countries. On the day of commemorating China's Maritime Day, we are particularly concerned about this issue.

The above four points are the main points that we should put forward on China's first Maritime Day. The 450 million Chinese people have infinite love for their beautiful rivers and mountains, and although we have encountered many hardships, we can only strengthen everyone's determination to fight. Yes, the spirit of navigation is originally the spirit of perseverance, hard work, and unremitting progress. As long as the whole country has a nautical mind, everyone knows that using the ocean is the foundation of building and strengthening the country, and everyone is determined to promote the development of marine affairs in all aspects, then the brilliance of the Chinese nation will surely be even more brilliant!

### Suzhou Embezzlement of Prisoner Food Case: Yin Renyi Detained and Involved in Litigation

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 3rd] In Wuxian County, this city, the allocation of prisoner food was reduced due to embezzlement, arousing public anger among the prisoners and almost causing a prison riot. The prisoners had previously sent representatives to jointly file a complaint with the Suzhou Higher Prosecutor's Office, which is still under investigation. Afterwards, Ding Baocheng, the deputy warden of the prison, entertained reporters and denied that there was embezzlement of prisoner food. However, due to the unanimous opinions, it was difficult to conceal the facts. On the 29th of last month, Ding suddenly detained Yin Renyi, the director of the kitchen, for two days and two nights, strictly interrogating him and accusing him of embezzling prisoner food. Yin's son submitted a statement to the Wudi Prosecutor's Office, accusing Warden Ding of fabricating evidence, shifting the blame to staff, illegally detaining him, and coercing a confession, requesting a hearing. The whole case has become more complicated.

### Please Look at the Suffering People of Fuzhou Enduring Summer in a Double Abyss: White-Haired Old Man Enacts Tragedy, Embracing Grandson and Jumping into River to Commit Suicide

[Special Dispatch from Fuzhou, 9th] Summer, in the eyes of a few in the city, is a season for leisure and enjoyment. However, what summer brings to this vast ancient capital of Fujian is distress and suffocation – the threat of summer! Since the beginning of summer, "water" and "fire," successive unfortunate disasters, have turned most of the kind people from poor to destitute.

Great Disaster Arrives Within Ten Days: In just ten days, four-fifths of the city became a watery expanse. Of the 330,000 population, more than 250,000 were affected by the disaster. The number of deaths, collapsed houses, and property losses is still unknown. Originally, the government should have quickly come up with measures to deal with the aftermath and provide emergency relief. Let's look at two or three things after the disaster: The "Fujian Provincial Flood Relief Committee" was born a few days after the flood. Chairman Liu even hired Speaker Ding of the Provincial Assembly and General Sa as directors. Later, after being supported by the locals, he also took on the title of chairman. But before that, how many disaster-stricken people had died, starved, or become homeless? How many were shedding tears and weeping blood? The rescue and shelter work was undertaken by local charitable organizations. Among them, the supply of rice depended on the government, but what effect did the wet rice allocated by the Food Bureau have on relieving the disaster victims? When the relief committee was established, Chairman Liu took the lead in donating one hundred million yuan, which is worthy of thanks from the common people. However, looking back at the situation of the relief for the Hunan disaster in the past, why not take out the past spirit to launch a Fujian disaster relief effort?

Post-Disaster Prices Rise Alarmingly: The post-disaster prices have risen especially crazily, making most people breathless with shock. The speed of inflation has naturally increased as a result. The Provincial Government Statistics Office announced that the general price index for Fuzhou City in June was 1,055,790 times higher, including food items 908,891 times higher (of which, grain was 1,031,511 times higher, and other food items were 878,448 times higher), clothing 1,622,054 times higher, fuel 1,179,851 times higher, building materials 907,986 times higher, metal and electrical materials 829,906 times higher, and miscellaneous items 967,620 times higher. The retail price index was 1,110,083 times higher, an average increase of more than 91% compared to May. Before the Dragon Boat Festival, the price of rice in Fuzhou was more than 6 million yuan per picul. After the festival, it rose to 9 million yuan. Who would have thought that the price of rice after the disaster would break the 10 million mark, then 20 million yuan, and reach 28 million yuan? The petty citizens were terrified by this crazy surge! When the price of rice hovered around the 10 million mark, some people believed that the early rice in northern Fujian was about to hit the market, and the price of rice was at its last glimmer of hope, with no possibility of further increase. According to past experience, February and March were the "difficult times." Therefore, some nervous rice merchants did not dare to buy in large quantities. However, the early rice in northern Fujian still had not hit the market, and the daily supply of 2,000 piculs of rice in Fuzhou City did not decrease as a result. In addition, the price of grain in various cities and counties in southern Fujian rose sharply, and the grain from the lower Yangtze flowed to the sea nearby. The rice from the upper reaches was snatched up and transported overseas before it even reached the Fuzhou docks. The sources of supply from the upper and lower reaches were cut off, and the amount of consumption remained the same. From 9 million yuan, it broke through the 10 million mark in two days. This flood affected nearly 30 cities and counties in the province, and the losses in rural areas were particularly severe. The early rice harvest was completely hopeless, and the late rice was damaged by about 50% or more. As a result, the recent surge in rice prices has gained a very good excuse.

Grain Stabilization Actually Increases Prices: All prices have risen, and the rice shop owner's words are the market price. You have to pay as much as they ask! In theory, since the price of rice has reached such an unmanageable situation, the government authorities should come up with concrete measures to stabilize the rising trend. However, the reality is not so. The "Grain Stabilization Store" does not carry out a large-scale sale, but instead "raises the price." The grain loans borrowed from the Central Bank, those who have used them to purchase grain, have never been distributed to the common people. The long-rumored "grain allocation" has not been realized to this day.

Under the high pressure of life, the number of hungry people is increasing every day, and incidents of jumping into the river, hanging oneself, selling wives, and selling children are heard every day. In these years, it is pitiful for pessimistic people to embark on the path of suicide. However, their escape from reality and adoption of this negative behavior is, in theory, not an irrational act. But seeing an old white-haired man at Cangqian Bridge hugging a three-year-old grandson and committing suicide by jumping into the river due to the pressure of life is enough to make people sad!

Natural and man-made disasters, water and fire coming at the same time, the consequences caused by this double abyss are unimaginable. After experiencing these double disasters, everything that people had left, everything that could be eaten has been eaten, and everything that could be sold has been sold. Facing this critical moment of life and death, can anyone think of a way for them to get through this merciless summer? (Historical Traces)

### Off-Site Trading Suffers a Blow, All Chinese Stocks Hit Limit Up, Foreign Stocks Unable to Trade Due to Inconvenient Meetings

Yesterday, the Garrison Department made every effort to crack down on off-site trading of Chinese stocks. However, as idle funds continued to gather from various sources, small-cap stocks and miscellaneous stocks shone first, creating a buying frenzy. Some who had shorted Wing On Cotton in the off-site market also bought in to cover their positions due to the tense environment. Although off-site trading ceased trading against the exchange, it was decided that only one-tenth of the transactions would be settled each day according to the number of accounts. Agent fees opened at the original price, while trading inside the exchange was increasingly excited. From Xinhua Department Store, which is about to increase its capital, to Guohuo, after 11 o'clock, the entire market was in the red. After Wing On Cotton rose to the limit of 5,755 yuan, it struggled slightly and continued to trade at a premium, reaching a new high of over 6,020 yuan, and finally struggled around 5,900 yuan. The police authorities patrolled the various trading houses and cut off telephone lines regardless of whether they were approved or not. Next week's trading is bound to be concentrated in the exchange. Wing On Cotton's direction will depend on the strength of the long and short positions. Small-cap stocks and miscellaneous stocks are bound to be even more popular. Chuansin large notes will be listed for circulation on the 5th, and people's hearts are easily stirred. All unlisted stocks outside the exchange rose by another 10% to 20%, with Bank, Culture, and Textile being the most outstanding.

Government bonds were also showing signs of activity yesterday. Trading was extremely inconvenient due to the police authorities' patrols, and only a little over one million yuan was traded. Unified C opened in the morning at 590,000 yuan and rose to 690,000 yuan before leveling off slightly. Compared to before the holiday, A and B rose by 60,000 yuan, C and E rose by 80,000 yuan, and Unified D rose by 70,000 yuan.

Foreign stocks were unable to conduct normal trading due to interference with the meeting address and some disputes.

### Investor Sentiment Is Bullish, Buying Enthusiasm Is High, Cotton Yarn and Cloth All Rise

Yesterday's cotton yarn market was characterized by a surge in stock prices, bullish investor sentiment, and active purchases by customers from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions. The outside industry was strongly bullish. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn initially opened at 850 million yuan. Later, due to the relationship on Saturday, the owners were unwilling to sell, and the market was firm. Near the close, there was some replenishment in the local market, and it ended at the 900 million yuan mark, an increase of 80 million yuan compared to before the holiday. The arbitrage trading of other counts of coarse and fine yarn was not weak, and the market was weak first and then firm. Compared with the end of June, most of them increased by 30 to 40 million yuan.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market was initially characterized by a public announcement prohibiting speculation and buying and selling on behalf of people outside the industry. The exchange was heavily guarded, and people were hesitant to start trading. Later, as most of the stock market hit the limit up, investor sentiment turned bullish. The leading fine cloth was still quoted in the off-site market. Although credit was tight, some people were searching and buying in the clear. The initial opening price was low for those in the same industry. There were also releases from Tianjin. The opening prices were all low. The leading cloth was traded at 21 million yuan. Then, there were short covering. Those with ample funds absorbed the goods, and the buying enthusiasm revived. It ended at 24 million yuan, an increase of 3.5 million yuan compared to before the holiday. The leading B cloth also increased by 2.3 million yuan. The remaining four gentlemen's serge, bleached cloth, coarse and fine twill, colored cloth, and Shilin cloth also increased by 1 to 2 million yuan.

Another report: The China Textile Yarn and Cloth Control Committee sold 499 pieces of yarn yesterday, with a total amount of 3,187,290,000 yuan. It also sold 46,090 bolts of cloth, 16,800 pounds of scrap cloth, and 320 bed sheets.

Strict Surveillance, Yarn and Cloth Market

[Report from this newspaper] Wang, the acting chairman of the Yarn and Cloth Control Committee, in order to cooperate with the security authorities' emergency measures to stabilize prices, instructed the committee's supervisory office the day before yesterday to strictly implement the supervision of the yarn and cloth market starting yesterday. The office prepared overnight. Yesterday morning, under the close coordination of the military, police, and military police, the deputy director of the office, Chang Lian, along with supervisors Meng Xianqi and others, went to the yarn and cloth market to set up a surveillance network. After the surveillance network played a thorough and strict role in both yarn markets, legitimate merchants were guaranteed, and speculative merchants immediately restrained themselves. Some who still tried to take advantage of the situation were exposed when checking the passes at the front and back doors of the market. Sixteen people were prohibited from entering the market because they did not meet the regulations. The entry permits of ten people were detained and handed over to the respective guild for safekeeping and disposal. Another two people were found to have helped speculative merchants raise prices and manipulate the market. After the facts were verified, they were taken to the Garrison Headquarters by the personnel stationed in the market to be dealt with after consultation. This measure by the committee has made the situation in the two yarn and cloth markets yesterday very stable, which proves that the supervisory work has been quite effective. This measure was drafted the night before and implemented after being approved by Acting Chairman Wang.

Textile Construction Plan, Exchange Yarn for Cotton

[Report from this newspaper] In order to effectively purchase cotton and tide over the period between harvests this year, the Textile Construction Company intends to exchange yarn and cloth products with farmers for raw cotton. The exchange rate will not be rigidly stipulated in advance but will be determined temporarily at the time of the transaction. This plan is being discussed by senior officials of the company and a decision can be made in the coming days. At present, the area for purchasing raw cotton is becoming narrower, and the difficulties in capital turnover have been overcome. However, farmers generally lack confidence in the value of legal tender and insist on paying in silver dollars when purchasing, which has caused technical difficulties. The Textile Construction Company's plan to exchange yarn for cotton is aimed at this point, because trading in silver dollars is not permitted by law, so it is replaced by barter.

### Silk All Rises

The artificial silk market still reported an increase yesterday, two hundred million yuan more than on Wednesday. 120-count Jin San Ma You Guang opened at 1.09 billion yuan in the morning. Due to the red market in the stock market, the market suddenly became turbulent, rising to 1.15 billion yuan. It once fell to 1.1 billion yuan.

The asking price for plaid wallpaper units was 2 million yuan in the morning and within the 2.2 million yuan mark in the afternoon, but no inquiries were made.

### Summer Woolens Lose Color

Due to the closure of customs for the past two days, the standard price of woolens caused the funds of each household to be gathered, and the entry and exit of bills were quite prosperous, but the business was not lively. In addition, the selling price has risen a lot all the way, and the actual sales are in the time between harvests. The main buyers have gradually reduced their purchases, resulting in the retail price remaining similar to before the customs closure. The summer goods such as Palissy, Fanliting, Yusha Ni, and Croxton, as well as light-colored thin floral woolens, all showed signs of decline yesterday. The trend at the tea party was all shrinking.

### Exchange Settlement Certificate, Deadline to be Extended

[Report from this newspaper] It is reported that the validity period of the exchange settlement certificate will be extended from the original seven days to one month. The Export Control Committee will officially announce it in the coming days. Exporters believe that after the deadline is extended, the exchange settlement certificate will not be forced to be sold at a low price as in the past. Therefore, the selling price of the exchange settlement certificate can be closer to the market price in the future, and the export situation can be improved.

### Limited Prices, Supervised Trading, Rice Market Still Stalled

People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee Stops Selling Rice

The rice market opened yesterday after the holiday, but because the authorities still limit the price and it cannot exceed last Friday, 16 million for White Geng, and economic police and security personnel are added to supervise trading, the owners feel that the cost is not enough, and no one sells, so the market is still stalled and not open. The People's Livelihood Adjustment Committee stopped selling rice on the same day. There was little off-site trading. In suburban areas such as Zhoujiabiao and Xujiahui, the retail price of White Geng was 20.5 million, Thin Rice was 21 million, and Early Rice was 19 million. Flour and miscellaneous grains were still closed due to price limits. The limit for flour was 5 million, and the limit for miscellaneous grains was not to exceed last week's prices.

### Development of Promissory Notes Not According to Rules, Financial Management Bureau Decides Not to Strictly Punish

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Financial Management Bureau, in order to crack down on bounced checks and the abuse of promissory notes by banks, sent personnel in batches to inspect the banks and found that customers of the banks borrowed promissory notes or issued bounced checks first to exchange for promissory notes, and then deposited funds to make up for them, or the banks did not record the development of promissory notes on the same day but recorded them on the day the promissory notes were recovered, and they allowed customers to use them without signing a loan agreement. The bureau has strictly prohibited this and imposed penalties separately, and a few banks have been requested by the bureau to the Ministry of Finance to remove their responsible persons and send them to the court for prosecution in order to warn others. It is now learned that the bureau has dispatched a large number of personnel to investigate the business of various banks yesterday in order to cooperate with the relevant authorities in this city to prevent price fluctuations in July, and found that the above situation still exists. The bureau hereby reiterates the previous order, and if any violations are found, they will be handled strictly in accordance with the provisions of Article 14 of the Measures for Strengthening the Control of Financial Business. Those with serious circumstances will also be ordered to suspend business. It is said that the three guilds of silver, money, and trust have been instructed to inform their member banks to comply with this order. According to the person in charge of the bureau, any bank that violates this law will be strictly punished and will not be lenient. At present, checking banks is one of the main goals, and it is hoped that all banks will be deeply vigilant and not be negligent.

### Lackluster Exports of Chinese Tea

[Report from this newspaper] In order to understand the recent situation of Chinese tea exports, the reporter specifically visited a tea tycoon. According to reports, there are still sales of precious eyebrows and other green teas in French North Africa, but the number is very small. The situation in other places is still showing no improvement. The reason for this is that after the domestic production costs have increased day by day, the price of tea is more upside down than the price of tea abroad. In addition, Japan, a defeated country, is frequently recovering with the assistance of the United States, and the export of tea is especially on the rise. It is said that it will continue to export in bulk soon, most of which will sell well in the United States, while the rest will be promoted to Europe and Africa. According to the current situation, if our country's tea is still allowed to be destroyed, it may be on the verge of extinction.

### Suppression of Yellow Music

Rushing to Produce Records to Correct the Musical Style

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd Dispatch] Regarding the suppression of yellow music, relevant authorities generally believe that instead of passively prohibiting it, it is better to actively create music to replace it. The Ministry of Education previously ordered the National Ritual and Music Hall to collect a collection of nation-building songs, which has been completed and handed over to Zhengzhong Book Company for publication. It also issued a circular to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces to submit music teaching materials from all levels of schools to the Ministry of Education for review and reconstruction. However, since yellow music is mostly disseminated through records, the Greater China Record Company has contacted people in the music industry to rush to produce records to replace it and correct the musical style.

### Hubbell Wins Wimbledon Title; Falkenburg Wins Men's Singles Championship; Wins Against Australian Bromwich in Five Sets

[Reuters, Wimbledon, 2nd Dispatch] The Wimbledon men's singles title has been won by the 22-year-old Californian youth Falkenburg, who defeated the Australian two-handed player Bromwich. The score was 7-5, 0-6, 6-2, 3-6, 7-5. The battle was intense, rare in a Wimbledon final. In the final set, Bromwich had a 5-3 lead, and in the ninth game, Bromwich had a 3-point lead and only needed one more point to end the set 6-3 and win the final victory. Unexpectedly, Falkenburg had the art of resurrection, winning four consecutive games, reversing the score to 7-5, and winning the final victory. The overall result of the match was 7-5, 0-6, 6-2, 3-6, 7-5, lasting approximately two hours. Looking at the performances of the two, neither reached the standard of a finalist. In the final set, both were overly nervous, and their performances were greatly inferior. In the first set, Falkenburg won 7-5. In the second set, Bromwich led all the way, ending it in eight minutes and winning a shutout. In the third set, Falkenburg regained the lead, and Bromwich never won a single service game in that set. The fourth set became increasingly tense, once tied at three each. Bromwich won the next three games, exceeding 6-3. Falkenburg is only 22 years old, from California, and is six feet one inch tall. Bromwich is 30 years old and of short stature, which is also one of the reasons for his disadvantage.

In the men's doubles, the American Tom Brown and Molloy won the finals by defeating the Swede Berglin and the Australian Ha Oil 1-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 8-6, and will compete with the Australian Bromwich and Segman for the championship. In mixed doubles, Bromwich and Miss White of the United States defeated Chegut Lobni and Mrs. Dute of the United States 5-7, 6-1, 8-6. Australian Segman and Miss Hurd of the United States defeated the American Tom Brown and Mrs. DuPont 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, and will compete for the championship. The Bromwich and White team were the champions of the previous mixed doubles.

The women's doubles is still dominated by American ladies. Miss White and Mrs. DuPont defeated Mrs. Lebani and Miss Scotfield 7-5, 6-0. Another team, Mrs. Dute and Miss Hurd, defeated the British Mrs. Postock and Mrs. Bly 6-4, 8-6. The White-DuPont team and the Dute-Hurd team will compete for the championship.

### The Ragtag Team Is No Match; Red Socks Defeat All-Star Team; The Two Teams Will Meet Again This Afternoon at the Racecourse

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] The Philippine baseball champion Red Socks team defeated the All-Star team with an overwhelming posture at the American Tongji Public School yesterday afternoon, with a score of seven to one. Before the game, the American and Philippine consuls-general performed the opening ceremony, and the 60-member orchestra led by the famous conductor Kang Tuolesi and Arlainasi of this city came to the venue to accompany the game. After the game, Thomas, Chairman of the American Overseas Chinese Association and Manager of Citibank, presented the award, a large silver cup, to the Philippine team.

The All-Star team is purely a ragtag bunch, and the performance was out of sync. Moreover, the pitchers McLay of the Air Force and Hanni Sansky of the Army were both out of sorts, and the performance was far inferior to that of Yu Changluan of Zhonghua. Compared with Zhonghua, the whole team, except for being slightly better in attack, was inferior in defense due to a lack of tacit understanding. In the second inning, two Red Socks players had already been eliminated, but they were still able to score four consecutive points by taking advantage of the repeated errors of the All-Star team inside and outside the field. In the third inning, McLay again frequently threw wild pitches, losing two more points, and fell into a big defeat. In the seventh inning, Ogaawa managed to break the duck for the All-Star team by taking advantage of the repeated mistakes of Gu Anga and Reid. The scores of each inning are as follows:

All-Star 〇〇〇〇〇〇一〇〇一一

Inning (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9)

Red Socks 〇四二一〇〇〇〇〇一七

The Red Socks and All-Star teams are scheduled to meet again at the Racecourse at 3:00 PM this afternoon to celebrate American Independence Day, and U.S. Navy Commander Olish will be invited to preside over the opening ceremony and award ceremony. At the same time, the Philippine Overseas Chinese Orchestra conducted by Javia will also come to the venue to accompany and cheer the game. The performance of the All-Star team in the first game was far from the standard, and today's lineup will be adjusted to seek revenge. The pitcher will be Yu Changluan, who was the most praised in the first game.

### Gongzhan Cup Middle School Basketball Tournament: John and Xinjian Will Compete for the Championship; This Afternoon at 2:00 PM at the City Gymnasium; Minli Wins the Women's Group Championship

The Gongzhan Cup Middle School Basketball League, sponsored by the City Gymnasium, has been competing for more than two months since it opened on April 24. Yesterday, four teams in the men's division competed for the finals. In the first game, Xinjian and Guangdong East were evenly matched in the preliminary round, and the scores were close. In the second half, Guangdong East lacked stamina and lost to Xinjian. The second game was John against City West. It turned out that John was the champion of last year's Yuxiu Cup, and City West was weaker. Although they tried their best to resist, they were eventually defeated by John. The third game was Minli against Nanmo in the women's division. The championship was determined by a three-game two-win system. Minli had already won the first game. Yesterday, the two teams fought again to determine who would win the championship. Although the forwards of Nanmo were still qualified in the first half, the guards were weaker. Minli was full of strength, and as a result, they won again and won the women's group championship. Today, Xinjian and John will compete for the men's championship, which is the last tense scene, and there will be a wonderful performance. The results of yesterday's games and today's final schedule are recorded below:

### Western Films No Longer Coming to China

— Pingzhai

For the past few days, newspapers have been reporting that Western films may no longer be imported to China. The reason is that Western film companies believe that the ticket prices set by the cinemas are too low, and the portion that is "split" with domestic film companies, when converted to foreign exchange, is minimal, resulting in no profit and even losses. Logically, cinemas should be on the same side as film companies when it comes to raising ticket prices. However, this time it is different. Although cinema ticket prices have been slightly increased, the cinema industry absolutely refuses to adopt the method of selling tickets at prices adjusted for the cost of living compared to pre-war prices, even at the risk of a complete breakdown with the Western film industry. It is said that the two sides are still at a standstill.

The cinema industry's refusal to "fully raise" ticket prices is actually a very insightful and clever move. With the depreciation of the legal tender, cinemas have already been doing "big bargain" business for the past few months. How could the cinema industry not understand this? How could they not want to make more money! However, they are facing two difficulties:

First, the general purchasing power has decreased significantly. Most people are worried about food and clothing and have very little spare money to watch movies. The lives of most people can no longer be "rationalized," so cinema ticket prices cannot be "rationalized" either. Movies can only rely on "selling in large quantities." What's the point of setting ticket prices at five million or ten million yuan when there are only "a few cats and dogs" in the theater!

Second, the production quality of Hollywood films has deteriorated significantly. The American film industry has publicly admitted that the current standard is far inferior to British films. In today's world, which is experiencing a "gold standard panic," the sales of American films in European countries have plummeted. Britain, which has always had a close relationship with the United States due to their shared language and culture, and was the largest customer of American films, has recently strictly limited the import of American films in order to save US dollars, and this has even caused dissatisfaction from the American diplomatic authorities. In this unprecedented "adverse situation," the profits of the American film industry are so small that they dare not rashly produce "million-dollar epics" or "all-star extravaganzas." Anyone who carefully observes the style of American films after the war will surely see the signs of "dare not spend money"—the quite successful "The Killers," for example, is entirely performed by second- or third-rate actors. Originally, "not spending much money" does not necessarily mean "not good," but unfortunately, Hollywood's art is the art of "money." Films like "The Killers" are rare occurrences, and can only be regarded as miracles.

Therefore, the reason why cinema ticket prices cannot soar like rice prices in the last two weeks is not due to a lack of effort, but because they have their own difficulties. But does the Western film company have the determination to stick to the end? Probably not. The origin of "killing the chicken to get the eggs" does come from abroad, and they should know this.

Objectively speaking, although Hollywood films often use pornography as a selling point, and often kill good original works with vulgar techniques, they do have their own indelible achievements. Biographies like "Wilson," and Disney's cartoons, should all be immortal. It would be a pity if they really stopped coming. However, don't the Chinese have a saying: "A loss may turn out to be a blessing in disguise?"

First of all, we can easily think of the Chinese film industry. If Western films really stop coming, it should naturally be the time for domestic films to dominate. Moreover, domestic films have indeed made progress. For example, "Fake Phoenixes," "Sunny Day," and "A River of Spring Flows Eastward," have all made significant progress in terms of technique and consciousness. The future is promising. As long as they continue to work hard, they will definitely achieve results.

However, can Chinese films really attract all the Western film audiences (we are only talking about the Chinese audience of Western films)? To be honest, probably not—at least not in the short term. In this regard, the only thing that can fill the vacuum left by Western films is spoken drama.

The achievements of the Chinese spoken drama scene in the past seven or eight years have been unprecedented. Taking the spoken dramas performed in Shanghai as an example, those translated or adapted from foreign plays include Barrie's "The Admirable Crichton" (the direct translation is "Worthy Crichton," I remember that the full translation was serialized in "Fiction Monthly" or "Literature" ten years ago), Gorky's "The Lower Depths," and Shakespeare's "Macbeth." Is the adapted name of "Macbeth" called "Hero in Troubled Times"? I can't remember clearly. What is even more gratifying are the scripts created by Chinese people, such as Ding Xilin's "Miaofeng Mountain," Chen Baichen's "Promotion Chart," Cao Yu's "Metamorphosis," Fei Mu's "Red Dust" (I think "Red Dust" is better than "Six Records of a Floating Life"), and Wu Zuguang's "Song of Righteousness"—truly a series of masterpieces, showing a thriving scene. Unexpectedly, when the flood of Hollywood films came, they became eclipsed and suffered a great loss. If Western films do not come, the revival of spoken drama is inevitable. To use an analogy, the standard of our spoken drama has gradually qualified to participate in the "World Games." Taking this opportunity to refuel and make rapid progress, isn't it great!

### Sea Red Mansion Poetry Records

— Xu Banmeng

Brother Hu Paosou invited guests to Luli, including Jiang Zhu,

Zhuang Suncang, Sou Dai Yuxiu, Sha Huaifu, Chen Zihe

All my schoolmates presented poems to Paosou at the banquet

After the chaos, we meet again with half our hair white,
Thank you for your kindness in inviting us to the building.
Ten years of separation is like a dream,
A hundred tribulations weigh heavily on our hearts.
Ancient and modern times churn as the sea changes,
Life and death intertwine as the great river flows.
Your rare age is a testament to your vitality,
Do not worry about minor illnesses and live in seclusion.

Old classmates of many years, our friendship fading,
Distant stars scattered in the darkness.
Our bodies drift together like duckweed,
Our eyes have seen Penglai Mountain change color several times!
The world's plans require dedication to the Dao,
Admire your family traditions and respectful conduct.
Alas, I cling to the love of clouds and mist,
Growing old in the empty mountains of Ziyun Cave. (I am currently staying at Ziyun Cave in West Lake to escape the summer heat.)

Sending a letter from Ziyun Cave to congratulate Paosou on his seventieth birthday

We studied together at Rongjiang in the past,
How many times has the world changed on a traveler's boat?
You are three years older but still vigorous,
I am still staying in two caves. (There is Louxia Cave next to Ziyun Cave.)
May your children and grandchildren be wealthy and happy,
May your writings and fame surpass your peers.
May people from north and south of Taishan pray for you,
I raise my golden cup towards Lianhu Lake from afar.

The waters of Lianhu Lake are comparable to West Lake,
The scenery is like a painted ridge.
The people's suffering from taxes requires urgent relief,
When will the country be safe and the roads smooth?
Cherish the chrysanthemums of Zimei and Tao Qian,
The idle clouds and Zhang Han's perch beyond the world.
I am pleased that the moonlight is bright and clear,
Human joys are enough for enjoyment.

"Mr. Harlap, please come over immediately. I broke that oil painting by Rembrandt. What will I do if my husband finds out?"

At midnight, Harlap, America's most famous restorer of all kinds of paintings, received this phone call. The caller was the wife of a famous collector in New York. Harlap had seen this famous masterpiece by Rembrandt, and he also knew that the painting was bought for $35,000.

(The Resurrection of a Famous Painting - From right to left in the picture: (1) is a mediocre portrait; (2) after X-ray irradiation, it was found that there was another shoulder on the left shoulder of the portrait, and a shadow of a hand in the lower right corner; (3) after the original portrait was washed off with medicine, the face of the woman in the original painting was still faintly visible; (4) The "painting washing" is completed, and it turns out that there is a genuine work by the famous Italian painter Murillo hidden here! This painting is worth $35,000.)

He rushed to his customer's house and saw that there was a crack between the nose and mouth of the figure in the painting. The young lady told him in tears that her husband had repeatedly told her not to move these picture frames when he left, but she had accidentally dropped the most valuable painting while moving the furniture. Her husband was returning to New York from another city tomorrow morning and would definitely be furious.

Harlap hurriedly took the painting to his studio and worked all night. By the time the sky was about to dawn, the painting had been returned to its owner, well repaired and hung on the wall. Only a microscope could reveal the traces of repair.

He first carefully examined the canvas of the original painting, and then selected another canvas of the exact same thickness and "wove" it into the crack in the painting. Then he imitated the brushstrokes and colors of the original work and carefully painted it. The result was truly "seamless." Six months later, the collector happily sold the painting for $40,000, and the new owner never discovered that the painting had been "patched." The person most grateful to Harlap was naturally the collector's wife, who gave him a gold watch pendant inlaid with diamonds to express her gratitude.

Harlap also often "washed" paintings. He often takes an ordinary painting and X-rays it first. As a result, he often finds that there is another painting underneath, and sometimes the one underneath is even a valuable masterpiece. So he gently rubs a secretly mixed medicine on the painting, and as a result, the oil painting on the top layer is quickly "washed" off, and the painting below immediately sees the light of day again. However, extreme care must be taken when using this medicine, otherwise even the oil paint on the bottom layer will be washed off.

Recently, a poor Italian woman took a worthless 17th-century book to Harlap's studio. She wanted to sell the painting cheaply to Harlap in order to get money to pay for her son's tuition. Harlap was temporarily inspired and X-rayed the painting. As a result, he found that there was indeed another painting underneath. After "washing" it, it turned out to be a work by the Italian Renaissance painter Andrea del Sarto! The poor mother was overjoyed, and Harlap was also happy and smiling.

Why would a famous painting be painted over with an ordinary painting by a mediocre painter? Harlap said that perhaps people wanted to avoid tariffs when smuggling these masterpieces abroad, so they "disguised" them. There are also other reasons. For example, during the reign of Queen Victoria in England, it was stipulated that all nude paintings must be repainted with clothing to maintain morality, and even nude winged cherubs were not allowed to be painted, and previously painted ones were not allowed to be preserved. As a result, people had to repaint something on them.

Harlap's skills in repairing paintings are not limited to this. Sometimes, a painting is so old and dilapidated that it cannot be washed or repaired. He takes it and stretches it on a specially made easel, with the painted side facing down. He first wets the upward side (the back of the painting), and then suddenly takes out a very sharp small knife and scratches the canvas (oil paintings are painted on canvas) in a burst of disorder, gently peeling it off! He said that people who paint oil paintings always add a layer of gelatinous substance to the canvas first, and then add the color. What he is now scraping off is the canvas! However, he never damages the extremely thin layer of gelatinous substance, so the original painting is not damaged at all.

Then, on the extremely thin gelatinous membrane on the easel, he applies a specially made strong glue. Before the glue dries, he has already glued a new canvas that has been prepared, and then carefully irons out the wrinkles with a special 20-pound heavy iron. Finally, he clamps the painting tightly in a clip that is extremely heavy on both sides. In this way, the painting has been "reborn." Then he gently wipes the front of the painting with medicine to remove the dirt accumulated over the years, and the life of a painting is extended by decades.

### Architectural Tidbits

— Songpu

In Sverdlovsk, Russia, there is a road paved with crushed jade, topaz, and malachite, which is truly beautiful and rare. It is also said that in Kimberley, South Africa, there is a road inlaid with diamonds, worth more than five million gold dollars.

An American car company has a building entirely made of glass. Customers do not have to enter, and they can see everything at a glance from the outside. It is even more beautiful at night. When the strong colorful lights are shone on it, it is brilliant and dazzling, as if watching a colorful movie.

### Qingxue Garden Reader

The name of the newly appointed Vice President of the Examination Yuan, Jia Jingde, is very familiar. I don't know if he is from Shanxi. If he is registered in Sanpu, then he should be a "Jinshi Gong" from the Jiachen year, who has served as the "County Magistrate" of Tancheng County. [Editor's note: Mr. Jia is indeed from Qinshui County, Shanxi, and has served as the magistrate of Zhaoyuan, Tancheng, and other counties."]

The Jiachen year (the thirtieth year of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty) was the last imperial examination. The imperial examinations of the Tang, Song, Ming, and Qing dynasties ended here. There were many celebrities on the list. The first place, Tan Yankai, the Huiyuan, whose courtesy name was Zu'an, was the youngest son of the former Guangdong Governor Tan Zhonglin, whose posthumous title was Wengong. He was soon admitted to the Hanlin Academy. He contributed to the Republic of China and served in important positions in the frontier and central government. In addition, there were famous reporter Huang Weiji (Yuanyong), famous painter Yao Hua, various religious scholars Dr. Chen Huanzhang, and Wang Yitang, the big-bearded pseudo-North China Committee Chairman who is now in prison in Beiping. This person's original name on the list was Zhiyang," later changed to "Geng," and then changed to his courtesy name because he had the same name as "another Wang Geng." He was also a Jinshi in the Jiachen year, and also led (the Examination Yuan; but the "pseudo-Yuan" during the occupation period.

The four chief examiners of the Jiachen Hui examination were Yu De, Zhang Baixi, Lu Runxiang, and Dai Hongci. Zhang Baixi was from Hunan, the same province as Tan, and they had a family friendship. When he saw Zu'an's paper (the policy essay was reformed, without copying, the handwriting was easy to recognize), he said that this was from our Hunan aristocratic family, and the article was also particularly good, so it could be designated as the Huiyuan. The chief examiner, Yu De, was Zhang's younger generation in the Hanlin Academy and happily agreed, and Tan Yankai became the first person on the entire list. The meaning and writing of that "Neutral and not leaning, how strong is the correction" were truly outstanding and extraordinary. (It was during the Russo-Japanese War, and the Qing government announced its neutrality. The topic hinted at the current situation.)

After the Gengzi Rebellion, the Qing government promoted reform. The imperial examination was abolished, and the examination was changed to test Confucian classics and policy essays. Candidates were allowed to discuss Chinese and foreign politics and current affairs, regardless of the old-fashioned lectures. It was considered a landmark progress in the old examination system, but it was only held for two examinations (two provincial and two metropolitan examinations), and then the imperial examination was completely abolished (special talents were cultivated from schools). Xu Shichang of Shuizhu Village was a Hanlin in the Bingxu year. He had been in the Hanlin Academy for more than ten years and had never judged papers. It was not until the Jiachen year that he was sent to participate in the court examination paper judging as a cabinet scholar. Therefore, in the preface he wrote in the Jiachen year, he said: "The examination of policy essays was first set in the Yin year (the Renyin provincial examination, policy essays were used for the first time), and the imperial examination system suddenly ended in the Chen year. I obtained the position of assistant examiner in this examination. In the Hanyuan Hall, I once saw the holding of the golden mirror; in front of the Guangfan Gate, I carefully counted the rows of morning bells. Ma Rong in his later years only loved the sound of the zither; Xu Yan's remaining teeth still thought of eating cakes." His words were full of joy and also full of sadness and attachment. It was precisely "The tea blossom has bloomed, the season is over, and the garden is full of cuckoos crying." It's over, it's over, everything is over!

Lu Jianxiang (Fengshi) was one of the last Zhuangyuan of Suzhou, also one of the last Zhuangyuan prime ministers of all dynasties, and also one of the people who personally presided over the last imperial examination, witnessing the "death" of the imperial examination.

President Zhang Boling of the Examination Yuan is an old doctor and a senior person who runs Nankai School. Vice President Jia is a famous Jinshi who succeeded in the old imperial examination. Yan Fanlao (Xiu), who first founded "Nankai," was a senior Hanlin in the Guiwei year and a pioneer in developing new education by running schools in the north. Then, when Zhang and Jia serve as the heads of the Examination Yuan, they should extract the essence from the old and new examination systems. Will they live up to our expectations?
