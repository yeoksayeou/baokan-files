### City Center Heroes Show Their Skills: The 7th National Games Opens Today; Chairman's Admonition to Develop National Sports

[Our Own Report] The 7th National Games is scheduled to open at 3:00 PM today at the stadium in the city center. Nearly 2,700 athletes will participate, representing more than 50 units. Since the first National Games held in the late Qing Dynasty, 37 years have passed. The various sports achievements throughout the years are due to the dedicated participation of provincial athletes, with new records being constantly broken. This holds profound value in the entire history of education and sports. After the closing of the 6th National Games, according to regulations, the 7th National Games should have been held in the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937]. However, the "July 7th Incident" [Marco Polo Bridge Incident] broke out, and the War of Resistance began, leading to an indefinite postponement. With the implementation of the constitution imminent and the suppression of the rebellion in full swing, the government is still striving to hold the 7th National Games in "55" [of the Republic, i.e., 1966, an obvious typo in the original], which is of profound significance. What is particularly encouraging for the people of the whole country is that the enthusiasm of athletes from various units to participate is even greater than in previous games. The Xikang team walked a long distance for as long as nine days. The Jilin team traveled south, braving the dangers of crossing bandit areas. The Taiwan province and overseas Chinese also showed unprecedented enthusiasm. This contains an epoch-making significance. The conference has invited the heads of various ministries and commissions of the central government, government officials, political committee members, and foreign guests, about 70 people, to participate in this unprecedented National Games. Honorary Vice Chairman Dai Chuanxian will also attend on behalf of Honorary Chairman Chiang, and the Chairman's special instruction, which was conveyed here today by the torch relay long-distance running team, is particularly valuable. Other major programs held today, such as football, basketball, and mass exercises, are also scheduled to be held at the same time. It is firmly believed that after the opening of the conference, facing the challenging circumstances, athletes will surely create new national records in sports achievements, in order to live up to the deep expectations that our government and people have accumulated in their hearts for more than ten years. The conference is scheduled to last for eleven days, with the closing ceremony to be held on the 15th. (For various programs of the National Games, please refer to the 5th, 6th, and 7th editions.)

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The 7th National Games is scheduled to open in Shanghai on the 5th. Chairman Chiang specially issued instructions, including the torch relay for the National Games. The long-distance running started at 3:00 PM on the 2nd from the National Government in Nanjing. The planned instructions were delivered to the Shanghai National Games venue, and the conference officially declared its opening and read them out on the spot. The full text of Chairman Chiang's instructions is recorded below: To the athletes of the 7th National Games:

The 7th National Games is being held three years after the victory of the War of Resistance, just as the constitutional government is beginning and before the World Games. The participating units cover the whole country. The athletes from the Northeast are happy to reunite after a long separation, and the athletes from Taiwan are even happier to return to the motherland. Reflecting on the past and learning from history, we deeply feel that this National Games not only has epoch-making significance, but also shares the tasks of the world. Not only should young athletes be excited, but the people of the whole country should also place great expectations on it.

Originally, the survival of a nation requires the sound development of morality, intelligence, and physical education. In particular, physical education is the basis of both morality and intelligence. Only with a strong physique and abundant spirit can we be resourceful and make progress day by day in terms of moral character, cultivation, and intelligence development. The wisdom, benevolence, and courage shown by our ancient sages and the two arts of archery and charioteering were listed as the center of the Six Arts, which is consistent with this principle. I hope that the athletes of the National Games will deeply recognize this noble truth and strive hard in the sports field. Strive for excellent performance in both technology and morality, bring the spirit of the Chinese nation to the world sports arena, and radiate brilliant light. At the same time, bring the harmonious feelings from the sports games back to the hometowns of the athletes, so that the feelings of our entire nation can be more closely exchanged and more sincerely united. And bring the special achievements gained in this conference back to the schools and places, encourage the atmosphere of love for sports, and make our national sports catch up with the progress. This is the most enthusiastic hope of Zhongzheng for the National Games, and it is also the greatest achievement of all the athletes. I wish you hard work, I wish you success, Chiang Chung-cheng.

The current agreement is only valid until July 3, and if the bilateral agreement is not signed by then, the aid to China plan will be temporarily shelved.

### Bandits Disturb Wancheng and Flee to Shanxian; Henan-Hubei Border Intensifies Suppression; Military Movement in Longdong Moves to the Border Mountains of Chongling

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 4th] The bandit troops of Liu Bocheng, Chen Yi, Chen Geng, Kong Congzhou, and Li Jingyi, who gathered in the Fangcheng, Huayang, Yexian, Lushan, and Nanzhao areas, began to move at the end of last month, fleeing to various counties in Wancheng. The situation is serious. The bandits' large-scale fleeing attempt this time is to destroy the local forces in Wancheng, open up the corridor of Funiu Mountain, Wudang Mountain, and Tongbai Mountain, and threaten Sichuan and Shaanxi. The entire battle situation is very critical.

[Our Own Report, Xi'an, 4th] Two brigades of Kong Congzhou's bandit troops in western Henan fled to Shanxian yesterday. Our local teams, with a large disparity in numbers, temporarily retreated to the southwest suburbs of the city under the leadership of Qin Tingyu, commissioner of the 11th District, to block the attack. At the moment, leading figures and gentry from Lingbao came here, calling for weapons and reinforcements. In addition, the area along the highway line from Zhenping in southwestern Henan to Xiping Town on the border of southern Shaanxi has had contact. Two brigades of Li Jingyi's bandit troops who fled to Xiping are moving eastward, seemingly to reinforce Kong Congzhou's bandit troops entrenched in Xixiakou.

### 29th Anniversary of the May Fourth Movement: Hu Shih Points Out the Path for Youth

[Our Nanjing Office, 4th Dispatch] On the morning of the 29th anniversary of "May Fourth," a reporter found Mr. Hu Shih, a leader of the "May Fourth" Movement. Mr. Hu began by stating definitively to the reporter: "The 'May Fourth' Movement was a new thought and new culture movement; it was not a political movement at the time." Mr. Hu then recounted the situation at the time, saying: "At that time, we felt that if we wanted to promote a new culture and new ideas, we had to establish a new foundation on a non-political basis. So, our proposition at that time was to not engage in politics for twenty years; some even advocated not talking about politics. Not talking about politics is impossible, but many of us did indeed refrain from engaging in politics for twenty years. I personally only became a diplomat twenty-one years after the May Fourth Movement. We tried our best to avoid politics, but politics could not avoid us; on the contrary, it forced itself upon us, so that the May Fourth Movement slowly became a political movement. Leaders of various parties all recognized this as a great force. At that time, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, in a letter to overseas comrades, mentioned the greatness of student power. Other communist parties and other parties also began to recognize the power of young students."

"Later, the political nature became extraordinarily strengthened. This may be good, or it may be bad, I don't want to comment, but the cultural significance was slowly weakened. I personally feel that this politicized movement was a bit too early, because the strength was inevitably insufficient. For nineteen years, I have always felt that the foundation of politics should be built on the foundation of culture and thought. We should work hard in cultural aspects, and now we must work hard in all aspects." Mr. Hu seemed to say with some doubts.

Speaking of the vernacular movement advocated at that time, Mr. Hu could not help but sigh even more deeply at the current revival of classical Chinese. He told the reporter that the current National Government is a revolutionary government, but the government's documents still use classical Chinese, even more ancient than classical Chinese. Take newspapers for example, there has been significant progress in recent years, and some are slowly writing articles in vernacular Chinese, but most newspapers still use classical Chinese. So, taking "vernacular Chinese" as an example, this is already a bit unfair to our time. At that time, we advocated vernacular Chinese in the fifth and sixth years of the Republic of China, but in just a few years, the textbooks in all elementary schools were changed to vernacular language. By the tenth year of the Republic of China, vernacular Chinese poetry was already very common.

Finally, Mr. Hu pointed out the path for youth, saying: "People who came out of the vernacular era should move towards the vernacular; people who came out of the new thought era should move towards new ideas; people who have received a new cultural education, we must move forward! The May Fourth era was both about destroying the old and building the new. The slogan at the time was to re-evaluate all values. Now, we must work hard in both of these aspects. We must use hard work to commemorate May Fourth, not just hold a meeting and call it a commemoration of May Fourth."

Mr. Hu originally planned to return to Beiping on the 3rd, but because there were still some things that were not completed, he bought an airplane ticket and then cancelled it. Before flying to Beiping, he will go to Shanghai first, and then take the "Air Overlord" north from Shanghai.

Enthusiastic Commemorations by Students Everywhere

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th Dispatch] Female college students held a "May Fourth" 29th Anniversary Commemoration Meeting this morning. More than 3,000 people from more than 40 units, including National Central University and National Chengchi University, participated, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. The meeting urged Mr. Fang Hao, a student leader in Beijing during the May Fourth Movement, to give a lecture on the May Fourth Movement. Subsequently, representatives from universities and colleges gave speeches one after another, unanimously emphasizing the implementation of democracy, the development of science, and denouncing the Communist bandits' attempt to use youth to slander this patriotic movement. Afterwards, female students presented flowers to Mr. Fang Hao, and the entire audience responded with warm applause. The meeting ended with shouts of slogans, and then the movie "Blood Splattered on the Lion Grove Bridge" was shown to entertain the participating students. They dispersed happily until after 11 o'clock.

[Our Beiping Office, 4th Dispatch] Faculty, students, and alumni of Peking University spent "May Fourth" in great joy today. The faculty and student commemoration meeting began at 10:00 a.m. in the square, with representatives from faculty, students, alumni, and staff delivering speeches, ending with the Yellow River Cantata. The School of Engineering presented the university with a large flag of "Democracy and Science" on the spot, and students raised donations for the Zimin Library. There was a large lunch gathering at noon, and the square was filled with cheers. A celebratory sports meeting was held in the afternoon. Alumni held a meeting at the Zimin Hall at 11:00 a.m., chaired by Wu Zhiren, chairman of the Municipal Party Department, and resolved to intensify fundraising for the construction of the Zimin Memorial Hall and send a telegram of respect to Hu Shih. Other schools also had celebratory evening parties.

[Our Hangzhou Office, 4th Dispatch] Today is May Fourth, and the commemoration meeting at the People's Education Center was cancelled. Students at Zhejiang University collectively applied for a day off to show their commemoration. Various lecture meetings, symposiums, and exhibitions were held in various departments, and there was a literary evening party in the evening. The National Academy of Art held a special exhibition of paintings by teachers and students.

Editorial

### Opening of the National Games!

The Seventh National Games will open grandly today at the Shanghai Municipal Stadium. This is a grand event symbolizing national unity and solidarity. More than 3,000 athletes from home and abroad are participating in this games, including more than 50 units. Everyone is elated, and the situation is very lively. At this time, when the grass is growing in the south of the Yangtze River, the sea is calm, and the birds are gathering and flying around, it can be said to be a very meaningful event in the world.

The National Games is a gathering to unite national elites, showcase sports skills, compete for trophies and flags, create performance records, and promote the martial spirit. According to past practice, the National Games is held every two years, with very few exceptions. It has been twelve years since 1935. The 1937 Games were once prepared, but the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident happened, and it was suspended again. Last year, someone planned to hold it on Double Ten Day, but it could not be realized due to insufficient conditions. This time, it was decided to hold it on May 5th of this year, which was the result of the hard work of the preparatory personnel. For twelve years, the flames of war have not ceased, and the war has been unsettled. Not only has the sports atmosphere been barren, but also moral and intellectual education has been declining. At this time, gathering elites from home and abroad in one place to hold a grand sports meeting is of far-reaching and significant significance, which cannot be ignored. If some people think that the country is in turmoil and the situation is unstable today, why hold the sports meeting; we believe that this idea ignores the importance of moral, intellectual, and physical education, and also ignores the democratic spirit promoted by this National Games.

Wrestling competitions and group sports are a virtue of mankind, a rational and stable group activity. Competition in the sports field follows order, abides by rules, values time, and obeys public opinion and referees. In sports competitions, winning people with virtue is more important than winning people with strength. Therefore, the spirit of athletes is a kind of democratic spirit; the demeanor of athletes in competition is especially the demeanor of excellent democratic fighters. The British compared the competition in Parliament to a good sports field, and the representatives of Parliament to disciplined and rule-abiding athletes. Parliament brings together fighters with different ideas and political views. They may argue until their faces are red and their ears are burning for the election of a person or the resolution of a matter, and the debate may be like a battleground, but at the sound of the gavel, everyone obeys, votes, and the minority obeys the majority, and after the meeting, they shake hands and reconcile, as close as brothers, which is especially rare and valuable. This kind of virtue that conforms to good reason is essential for the people of democratic countries, and only the sports field has this spirit, and only athletes have this demeanor. Therefore, we believe that the holding of this National Games is well-timed, and it is more about cultivating a democratic demeanor than promoting the martial spirit.

The athletes participating in this National Games have come to Shanghai from thousands of miles away, some from Java and Hawaii overseas, some from the White Mountains and Black Waters, and even from Taiwan and Xinjiang. It is more enthusiastic and active than any previous games, and the line is well-organized, which shows that the Chinese sons and daughters are inclined to the motherland and nostalgic for the motherland. They do not hesitate to go through all kinds of hardships to gather at sea, not for the sake of winning trophies and exchanging for the glory of one's own place, but for the sake of unity and symbolizing the integrity of the Chinese family.

### Pu Lide Returns to China

American diplomat Mr. Pu Lide returned to China the day before yesterday and will have a "month-long visit. Although Mr. Pu's visit is entirely private, we understand his concern about the development of China's situation since he left China last September. Just from this point, we cannot help but express our heartfelt welcome to the return of this friend of China.

After Mr. Pu Lide left China and returned to his country last year, he published an article "Impressions of Visiting China" in "Life" magazine, which was not only valued by the American government and the public, but also today we reread the article, we cannot but admire Mr. Pu Lide's foresight and vision. From that time to now, only half a year has passed, and the attitude of the American government and the public towards China has completely changed. No matter how Marshall persists in his prejudice of "Europe First," he cannot but admit the importance of aiding China. Moreover, the US Foreign Aid Act has been signed by President Truman, and its total foreign aid amount of 6.098 billion US dollars includes 463 million US dollars in economic and military aid to China. Now the authorities of China and the United States have exchanged letters, willing to immediately sign an agreement to implement this act. In terms of personnel, the United States has also appointed the shrewd and capable Mr. Hoffman to be in charge of the matter. In terms of the American people, their attitude towards China has also changed. According to a recent survey conducted by the Gallup poll, asking the American people for answers on the topic of "Do you support giving more military and economic assistance to Chairman Chiang's National Government?" The results showed that 55% of the people supported it, 32% opposed it, and 13% had no opinion. Among those who supported it, most were American veterans, who unanimously believed that to eliminate the source of international chaos, it is necessary to actively assist China economically and militarily.

The progress of the American government and the public's understanding of China is the result of Mr. Pu Lide and others running around and calling for help. The insights they published are not only based on facts, but also the evolution of the international situation in the past six months has further proved the correctness of their observations. In the past, most of the American government and the general public hoped that China could also unite all parties and factions to form a "coalition government" to achieve the goals of peace, democracy, unity, and strength; General Marshall personally came to China to mediate the negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the indifference to the issue of aiding China after Marshall returned to his country, may not have been because he was dreaming of the realization of this ideal. However, after the coup in the Czech Republic in February and March of this year, and the tragedy of Foreign Minister Masaryk, the world's perception changed, and all illusions about "coalition governments" disappeared. This has already proved the international nature of the Communist Party, and no matter what country it is in, the people will inevitably encounter the tragic pain of national subjugation when the Communist Party takes power. Recently, the CCP newspaper publicly shouted the slogan of "fighting the revolutionary war to the end," which further proves that if you still want the government to negotiate peace with the Communist Party, it is like a fool's dream, seeking skin from a tiger. The American government and the public have now recognized this point clearly; it is just six or seven months behind Mr. Pu Lide in terms of time. Assuming that the American government and the public had this understanding earlier, the China issue would not have been so bad today, and there would be no need for Mr. Pu Lide to come to China again.

However, from another perspective, although the American commentariat unanimously acknowledges the seriousness of the China issue and jointly advocates that economic and military aid to China should be stepped up, judging from the actions of the American government, the focus of American foreign aid is still not in China but in Europe. According to Mr. Bei Zuyi, who has just returned from the United States, "This trip brought back Hoffman's views on handling US aid materials to China. So far, the principled issues have been negotiated, and only technical issues remain to be negotiated." As for personnel issues, according to foreign newspapers, Washington is considering having Mr. Gilbert, the counselor of the US Embassy in China and the head of the China Relief Mission, preside over it. The slowness of American aid to China is so slow, and the domestic economic difficulties in our country are also like that; how can the snail-like pace make the distant water save the nearby fire? To request the American authorities to act quickly, we have to pin our hopes on Mr. Pu Lide, who has returned to China again, hoping that after he returns to his country in June, he will make an urgent appeal to the American government and the public again.

Among them, 900 able-bodied refugees and their families are about to be sent to Suiyuan to engage in land reclamation. The main part of the US's 45 million US dollar relief plan for China is to purchase and transport rice and noodles for general distribution in five major cities, and then use the proceeds from the sale of grain to promote other specially selected relief plans. Relief to Mongolian refugees is one of the special relief plans of the group. The group started in February and will provide general emergency relief to 2,600 Mongolian refugees in Beiping and Zhangjiakou for five months from February to June. Each adult can receive 21 market catties of millet per day, and each child can receive 12 market catties of millet per day. In addition, each person can receive 16 feet of cotton cloth and other clothing. At the same time, the Mongolian areas in the two provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan are now feeling the threat of famine. The 200,000 Mongolian people in the area are also in urgent need of relief. After the expert Sheng Ruiheng, who is familiar with the Mongolian situation, conducted an on-the-spot investigation of the famine situation, he has drafted a large-scale direct relief plan to purchase and transport 1,500 tons of food to Yikezhao League (located southwest of Baotou), Tumut Banner (near Guisui), Ulanqab League (located northwest of Baotou), and four league areas north of Guisui to launch the first phase of relief work.

### Agricultural Production in the Northeast Should Be Developed Urgently

It is urgent to develop and increase production. The irrigation project of Hun River in Dongling, Shenyang, and the cultivation situation in Liaozhong County are very promising due to the good security situation. It is definitely not as bad as the rumors, so it is recommended that the Northeast, which lacks seeds, agricultural tools, tractors, and parts, should quickly find ways to allocate and transport them.

### U.S. Policy on the Holy Land Remains Unchanged; Austin Flies to Washington for Talks with Marshall; Britain Suggests Establishing a Neutral Provisional Body

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] When a State Department spokesman was asked about rumors that the United States would again change its policy on Palestine, he said that as far as he knew, the United States had no new policy on Palestine. He also revealed that Austin, the chief U.S. representative to the United Nations, would return to Washington from Lake Success on the 4th to discuss the situation in Palestine with Secretary of State Marshall and Under Secretary of State Lovett.

[United Press, Lake Success, 3rd] British Colonial Secretary Jones proposed today to the Political Committee of the 58-nation United Nations Special Assembly to establish a neutral emergency group to take over Palestine after Britain ends its mandate on May 15. It is claimed that the war crisis in the Holy Land is now destroying the United Nations mechanism, and a detailed plan has not been explained. According to informed sources, Britain advocates a committee composed of several countries, whose members may be drawn from the United States, Britain, and France. Jones believes that the U.S. trusteeship plan is unlikely to pass, so some representatives expect the United States to abandon the trusteeship proposal and support the new British plan. Canada has now seconded it. U.S. representative Jessup, although he did not directly express his opinion, said that the British plan was thought-provoking.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 3rd] The United Nations Trusteeship Council has decided that negotiations on the terms of a truce in the Old City of Jerusalem should be held in Jerusalem and will ask Sir Knox Helm, the British High Commissioner in Palestine, to mediate. Prior to the establishment of this resolution, the Chairman of the Trusteeship Council, U.S. representative Searle, reported that he had received a telegram from Gulion, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Jewish Community Council of Palestine, stating that the truce order in the Old City of Jerusalem was issued on the 3rd, pending negotiations on the terms of the truce, including freedom of entry and exit. However, if an agreement is not reached, both sides will resume freedom of action. Searle also said that he had notified the Arab Higher Committee's representative to the United Nations, Husseini, that the truce order in the Old City of Jerusalem had taken effect. After Searle's report, the Trusteeship Council held a closed meeting to listen to the confidential report of British representative Kirk on the progress of the Holy Land truce negotiations. Kirk insisted that the Holy City Committee should be chaired by a neutral person. He believed that the representative of the International Red Cross in Palestine was a possible candidate for chairman, but the rules of the Red Cross did not allow him to hold this position. It is reported that both the Arab and Jewish sides are conducting negotiations in Jerusalem under the supervision of the International Red Cross to establish a safe zone for women and children in the Holy City, but representatives of the Jewish Community Council and the Arab Higher Committee to the United Nations have both stated that they are unaware of this matter. The U.S. representative to the Trusteeship Council welcomed the Red Cross's efforts and expressed the hope that consideration of the temporary trusteeship plan for Jerusalem could be suspended pending information on the outcome of the Red Cross's mediation.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 4th] The Trusteeship Council adjourned on the night of the 3rd without reaching any agreement on the protection of Jerusalem. The joint efforts of representatives from China, France, New Zealand, the United States, and Britain failed to dispel the determination of other countries to refuse the use of force in Jerusalem, and the suggestions of France to use international troops and the United States to establish temporary trusteeship were also rejected.

### Arab Legion Moves Towards the Holy Land; Offensive Launched South of Jerusalem; Jewish Forces Claim Arab Army's Attack Was Thwarted

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 4th] Arab forces, which had been concentrating in the hills south of the Holy City for the past three days, launched a large-scale offensive at dawn on the 4th against the Kfar Etzion Jewish area on the Jerusalem-Hebron road. Jewish sources said that the Haganah and Irgun forces were prepared in advance, and the first and second offensives of the Arab forces had been repelled, with heavy losses.

Jewish sources also said that the attacking Arab forces numbered about 2,000. The residents of Kfar Etzion village are all Jewish and it occupies an important strategic position, holding the lifeline from southern Palestine to the Holy City.

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 4th] Jewish forces today announced that they had captured the Arab stronghold of Yehudia village after a night of fierce fighting.

[Reuters, Damascus, 4th] The armies of the Arab countries have begun to move towards the Palestinian battlefield. A brigade of Iraqi motorized troops that has arrived in Transjordan has joined the Arab Legion trained by the British under the command of King Abdullah of Transjordan, preparing to enter Palestine.

[Reuters, Tel Aviv, 3rd] British troops patrolled the streets of Jaffa today. The British Army Headquarters in Jerusalem announced that the entire territory of Palestine was quieter today, with only occasional shooting incidents in the Arab village of Qatamon in the southern suburbs of Jerusalem, disrupting the ceasefire order issued yesterday.

Arabs in Jaffa continued to withdraw in large numbers by sea and land. There are only a few thousand Arabs still in the city. British troops occupied Tel Rish Hill south of Jaffa this afternoon and warned both Jewish and Arab sides that anyone shooting in the area would be bombarded. A unit of British Marines arrived in Jerusalem today to reinforce the defense. Jewish forces are still holding the Arab village of Qatamon in the southern suburbs of Jerusalem, and their defense line has been extended near the British security zone. A spokesman for the Jewish Community Council declared at a press conference today that Arabs had withdrawn in large numbers from Safed, a city in northern Palestine's Upper Galilee where Jews and Arabs live together. The spokesman also said that there was a general mentality of escape among the Arabs of Palestine and that none of the twelve members of the Arab Higher Committee were still in Palestine.

[United Press, Lake Success, 3rd] Reliable sources disclosed on the 3rd that the Arab countries near Palestine had notified Britain and the United States that they would not invade the Holy Land before Britain ended its mandate on May 15.

### Pope Calls on the World to Pray for Peace in the Holy Land

[Central News Agency, Vatican City, 3rd, United Press] The Pope recently sent an order to Catholic bishops everywhere to hold prayers throughout May, hoping that the Palestinian issue would be resolved justly and that peace would be brought to the area.

### Belgian Cabinet Decides to Resign

Hot Water is Not Enough; People are Complaining The Taiwan Female Athletes Want to Eat Watermelon [Report from this Newspaper] The athletes from all over the country in this National Games have some disappointment with the conference office. The female athletes from Fujian told reporters that they arrived in Shanghai on April 27, standing in the open air for more than three hours, and no one entertained them. As a result, some people slept on the cement floor overnight. Wang Jinshu, a female tennis player from Guiyang, is over thirty years old. After arriving in Shanghai, she suddenly grew wisdom teeth, and her gums were swollen and she had a fever, so she fell ill. She is anxious and has been consulting a doctor for treatment for days. There is no hot water supply in the athlete's dormitory, and they all use cold water for bathing, which causes most of them to catch a cold. Moreover, there is also a lack of boiled water in the dormitory. Except for the boiled water available during meals every day, it is not easy to drink at other times, which causes the athletes to complain. When the reporter visited yesterday, I saw a female general from Fujian throwing a suitcase and losing her temper. Among the female athletes in Taiwan, some were sick because they could not eat watermelon in Shanghai and suffered from constipation. They said: They must eat watermelon three or four times a day in Taiwan. The price of fruit in Shanghai is expensive, and it is not good. Many of the athletes are coming to Shanghai for the first time. Their first tour is to visit the four major companies, but they are all shocked by the crowds. The representative from Fujian said: "I never thought there would be so many people in Shanghai." The athletes from Taiwan said: "The continuous stream of cars on the road made us faint." Before coming to Shanghai, the athletes from Guiyang first went to Hangzhou for a week-long trip. They all said: Hangzhou is beautiful and quiet, what about Shanghai? It is dirty and chaotic. The Guizhou team has the best autonomy spirit in the National Games. A large notice was posted in front of the dormitory, stating: "The team's rest time is stipulated below. Those who do not follow the stipulated time will be dealt with according to the province's athlete management measures." Strict regulations are made for the time of getting up, roll call, practice, breakfast, lunch, lunch break, dinner, and rest.

[Report from This Newspaper] The staff of the special interview broadcasting vehicle of this newspaper have been working hard since they departed from Shanghai at 4:00 PM on the 1st. There is still half a day's journey left today, and they will be able to complete the entire journey. I can't help but feel excited. This newspaper and the Shanghai Branch of the Mountain Country Amateur Radio Association jointly organized this Beijing-Shanghai torch relay long-distance running interview and broadcasting. The association's enthusiastic service and support for news reports are commendable! Whether it is the deployment of amateur radio stations across the country, the installation of equipment in special vehicles, or the roadside broadcasting reports since departure, especially Mr. Xu Yujia's leadership of the work, they have done their best and best efforts. It not only fulfills the original intention of this newspaper to promote sports and serve readers, but also lays the foundation for future cooperation between this newspaper and amateur radio experts. I am deeply grateful. The special vehicle was rented from Liangjiang Automobile Company, which is the latest type of tour bus. The company offered preferential prices. The departure date was during heavy rain, and the Beijing-Shanghai highway was in disrepair for many years. For the sake of prudence, the company specially sent Chen Xianqi, director of the service department, to accompany and take care of it. On the afternoon of the 1st, only a dozen kilometers away from Changshu, the road was narrow and steep, and a major accident was almost caused. Fortunately, Mr. Chen's command and the driver's calm response turned the danger into safety. We are very grateful for the company's assistance this time. The situation when the torch relay long-distance runners passed through Meiyuan, Wuxi. The ones on the right are the escorting students from Jiangnan University (Photo by Ji Jingqiu) Soccer Game Schedule Fieldside Chat The athletes from various provinces are greatly troubled by the language barrier in Shanghai, especially the overseas Chinese from Nanyang and the representatives from the border areas. As a result, many people have been taken advantage of as "Ah Mu Lin". I sincerely hope that our Shanghai municipal staff will correct this if it is true, and if not, encourage each other, so as not to leave such a bad impression on these compatriots. Today there is a group exercise program with 6,000 people. This is the most valuable item in the entire National Games program, because cultivating a spirit of cooperation and training organizational skills is far above creating a few sports stars. It cannot be said that Shanghai has not done its best in the financial burden of this National Games. However, after the athletes from the Shanghai team went to various places to raise money, it is said that they are preparing to "go shirtless", which is ironic and tragic. I hope for a miracle tonight, so that we will not lose face for Shanghai today. Some of the representative teams did not have an item for accommodation expenses in their budget. After a few days of "Yangtze" and "Jinmen", a large amount of funds was spent. They are worrying about the "how to return" problem after the conference is over. (O·K·).

Brilliant prospects for track and field events; long-distance records are sure to be broken Reporter Zhang Shengzhi [Special Feature by This Newspaper] The long-distance races in this National Games will bring us two pieces of great news: old records will be broken. At the same time, the new force from Taiwan may stage some pleasing and moving scenes. The track and field community, which has been fragmented and turbulent for thirteen years, will, after today, step by step embark on a bright and brilliant path. Long Distance Without a doubt, the 10,000-meter race this time will not only shatter past records significantly, but if the deaf-mute general Lou Wen'ao can continue to shorten his time by one minute, there may still be a chance to catch his breath at the World Games. Speaking of this 10,000-meter race, it can be said that great generals are gathered and competition will be fierce. In addition to Lou Wen'ao having a strength of 31 minutes and 27.4 seconds, far ahead of the others, the navy's Liu Jingxian's 33 minutes and 26 seconds has also broken the national old record of Sun Che's 34 minutes and 1.1 seconds. There are also half a dozen or so with scores around 35 minutes. This time, "Skinny Monkey" Wang Zhenglin has not returned from the United States, and Liu Jingkun is sure to win the silver medal. An Benquan of the United Logistics team has also had a record of 34 minutes and 14 seconds. If he can maintain this time, he can be sure of third place. Although the 10,000-meter record can be said to be definitely broken, the only hope is still pinned on whether Lou Wen'ao can cross the 31-minute mark. The 5,000-meter race in the long distance is also a gratifying thing. The 17 minutes and 13.4 seconds held by Wang Zhenglin in the past has been quickly broken by Liu Jingkun of the navy. Yang Liansheng of Hubei and Zeng Fusheng of Taiwan have broken it successively. The former is 12 minutes and 16.2 seconds, the latter is 16 minutes and 44 seconds, and the latter is 16 minutes and 53.7 seconds. An Benquan of the United Logistics team also has a score of about 17 minutes and 15 seconds. In addition, Zhang Daoan of Hebei and Nie Bingying of the Northeast have scores that are said to be good, so it is expected that the competition for the second, third and fourth places will be fierce. Middle Distance In the middle-distance race, there is a better score in the 1,500 meters.

The Future Trend of Literature and Art  Sun Fuxi

China's implementation of democracy is about to begin. Therefore, all facilities in China's politics, society, culture, education, etc., must be reformed and rebuilt. If we change the appearance but lack the substance, or cling to the old and seek temporary ease, not only will there be no progress, but we will also miss the opportunity and ruin the revival of the Chinese nation.

Literature and art are the soul of a nation and should lead everything forward. They must not be bound or hindered by anything, and artists must not be made to feel inferior, deceive themselves, or be timid.

The mission of artists is to express their opinions to the fullest extent within the scope permitted by the constitution and, to the best of their ability, to enlighten people with foresight and awaken them with awareness. If they are even slightly hesitant, if they do not fully express what they know or fully convey their meaning, they would not only be ashamed to be artists but also ashamed to be democratic citizens. Even if something is not permitted by the constitution, artists, with their personal feelings or with a compassionate and fearless spirit, should loudly call for the people's suffering and raise the banner of revolution to change the application of the constitution. Such precedents are not only common in democratic countries, but also often seen under autocratic tyrants. In modern times, France had Zola, the United States had Lincoln, and China's Sun Yat-sen, from the Xinhai Revolution to the National Revolution, first had written calls and appeals, followed by political and social revolutionary movements, all of which are clear precedents.

Only by recognizing the importance of the mission of literature and art can we rebuild the fortress of literature and art. Literature and art, like religion, are majestic and solemn, truly sacred and inviolable. If we can respect and worship them and follow their rationality, they can be called all-encompassing and universally effective. Their efficacy is so broad, profound, and subtle that it is beyond our imagination. No matter how big or small the matter, they can be used at will and will be effective as long as we are absolutely obedient. The only requirement is that the user's motivation is selfless and impartial.

In the future, if we want literature and art to exert their greatest effect, we must first respect the objectivity of literature and art, just like religion, and not use temples to deceive the public and collect money. Authors should aim for the nation and the people, and readers should also abandon selfish and suspicious prejudices. Like a bright mirror or a clear spring, they should reflect social reality without any distortion. If everyone accepts it with an open mind, there will be new opportunities for reform in politics, society, culture, and education, and the national spirit will be rejuvenated. Only then can we truly be called a democratic country.

### Painting the Scenery on the Way to Mount Emei by Pan Yun'e  Zheng Wuchang

Ten thousand peaks fill the canvas with spring,
In my heart, there is ink, and my brush is free from dust;
In a bamboo sedan chair, I spend days ascending through the clouds,
Together, we become people on the top of Mount Emei.

Ferry  Zhou Shan

In the southwest, in that mountainous area, even a small stream can have times of rushing and surging! There are countless rapids and dangerous shoals: Yangjiao Shoal, Fubo Shoal, Lijia Mouth, and Ghost Gate Pass—what a thrilling scene!

During the hot summer, when mountain floods erupt and the river is full of water, the momentum is even more spectacular. The turbid river water, in the midst of ten thousand mountains, carries people, livestock, and fragments of shattered wooden boats at unparalleled speed, passing through piles of rocks, bypassing jagged mountain mouths, and rushing forward in a noisy and crowded manner! One vortex after another turns and sneers. The waves are like boiling water in a pot: below, hidden reefs rise and fall. On such a great river, those boatmen, those who live by the water, brave the severe cold or scorching heat every day, rowing a small boat, carrying a dozen passengers, back and forth. They have a skill that is more agile than water! They have a voice that is louder than water:

"Coming...? Going up to Wentan, Eryan, Baishatuo, Chengjiangkou!"

"Going...? Going down to Tangjiatuo, Baimiaozi, Tutuo...!"

Those rushing to board the boat with "bundles," "backpacks," "boxes," and "baskets" got on the boat one by one in response to the shouts. And another person walked to the dock, and the boatmen swarmed forward and surrounded him:

"Bearded one! This boat."

"Straw hat! Straw hat! Going to Eryan? That's right! Get on this boat."

"Bastard! How many people are you going to load?"

"You son of a bitch, you only loaded one boat yesterday, and you're trying to snatch again? Old man! We haven't loaded anyone for three days! Straw hat! Get on the boat."

"You ancestors, you haven't loaded anyone, that's your bad luck!"

The old man, nicknamed "Bearded one" and "Straw hat," put down his burden and wiped the sweat from his face with the corner of his clothes:

"I'm crossing the river."

The contention, insults, and hopes shattered and disappeared like glittering bubbles!

Urged by the crowd of passengers, the boat left the dock. But it did not leave immediately, but lingered on the river surface a dozen feet away from the shore, trying to wait for one or two more passengers who were traveling a long distance. Their gaze and eyes were full of expectation! Anxiety! Despair!

"Boss, are you taking us on a river tour?"

"Why don't you just go ashore and pull a few people onto the boat!"

"Guests, life is hard! It's only our turn every few days..."

Yes, who doesn't feel the pressure of life! Who isn't struggling on the edge of despair! What reason do we have to be harsh on him in the face of such a straightforward plea!

The setting sun turned the river water red, and the small boat was heading upstream. Downstream boats were like wind sweeping away the clouds, like shooting stars on a summer night, arriving in front of them in an instant. The helmsman greeted them:

"Brother Wang Wu, you're having a good time!"

At this moment, Brother Wang Wu and his assistant were fighting the rapids! These were two jagged rocks protruding from the river, and the boat had to pass through the gap between them! The water rushed down quickly, Wang Wu supported the oar with his right hand, grasped the long rudder with his left hand, braced his feet tightly against the cabin board, and leaned back slightly! And the assistant on the shore was prostrate on the beach, with a tow rope tied diagonally across his shoulder! He crawled like a dog!

Minute after minute passed, the river water was blocked by the small boat, and it became enraged: roaring, swirling, and rushing over with force, making the small boat tremble.

"Guests! Don't move!"

In just an instant, the small boat safely passed the dangerous passage!

"Bastards!"

"Push hard!"

Wang Wu's bronze-colored face was covered with sweat. The muscles on his arms bulged one by one: he rowed one oar after another! The young sailor on the bow was furious:

"Damn it! I've used all my strength;"

"Your old man's oar is just hitting the water!"

"Bastard, I..."

The boat approached the shore amidst the mutual cursing: a mountain mouth blocked the raging river! They put down their oars. Wang Wu lit a cheap cigarette, took a few deep puffs, and asked the guest to pass it to the young sailor: they reconciled!

A little further away, twenty or thirty trackers were dragging a heavy cargo ship upstream:

"Yo! Yo! Yo! Hey... Yo!"

The heavy shouts seemed to be sorrowful sighs uttered from the depths of the earth!

In the sunset glow of the evening, the small boat docked at the pier. While Wang Wu was receiving the passengers' fares, he shouted in a rising and falling tone:

"Guests! Take care of your belongings!"

Heine's Eight-Line Poems Translated by Liao Xiaofan

Sublime oaths of love,
Lock our hearts together,
They cuddle each other tightly,
They understand each other even deeper.

Ah! Only the one adorning your breast,
A young rose,
Poor partner!
Almost crushed by us.

The girl stands by the sea,
Sighing long and sadly,
As if the sinking of the sun,
Caused her inexplicable sorrow.

My girl! Be happier!
What an ordinary thing this is!
Although it has fallen today,
It will climb up again tomorrow.

The sea sparkles in the sunlight,
The surface is gilded with gold,
Friends, if I die,
Please sink me into the heart of the sea.

The sea is always so gentle,
It has soft, cottony waves,
Often chilling my heart,
I wish to be with it forever.

I have my ideal homeland,
Where oak trees grow tall,
And violets warmly greet,
But that is just a dream,
The girl kisses me in the German way,
And says in German: "Ich liebe dich!"
(There is no more beautiful sound in the world!)
But that is just a dream.

Preface to the Trial Publication of the Literary Magazine Edited by the Shanghai Literary Writers Association  Wang Jinshan

A trial publication! It is not a founding; it is an attempt to found; or some may say: it is also a founding.

A founding, as usual, has words; how can a trial publication have no words, hence writing a preface to the trial publication.

Our association has no economic foundation, no allocated paper, and no printing equipment: originally, it did not have the conditions to publish a periodical. Yet, why do we want to publish a periodical? That is because the association's constitution stipulates that it should publish a periodical; members demand it, needing to publish a periodical: and, observing the current environment, it is even more necessary to publish a periodical.

Reason one is that the association's constitution stipulates that the association's mission is to seek the development of literary and artistic undertakings, the introduction and publication of members' works, and the connection of writers, etc. Therefore, it should publish a periodical.

Reason two is that the members of the association all take engaging in literary writing and literary work as their duty. In order to publish works and exchange opinions, on the day of the association's founding last year, they jointly demanded the publication of a periodical. Therefore, it is necessary to publish a periodical.

Reason three is that literature and art are the reflection of the times and the spiritual food of the masses. At present, not only is the publication of general literary books and periodicals withering and declining, but some are simply using literary forms to engage in propaganda that undermines the interests of the country and the nation, acting as accomplices to the new feudal forces. Some even continue the enslaved literary style of the enemy-puppet period, regressing the content and consciousness of their works to before the May Fourth Movement, anesthetizing the souls of readers; representing the dying embers of the old feudal forces. In addition, there are many authors who are drunk and dreaming of death, and, like the previous two types of people, also disregard the trends of the times and are out of touch with reality, regarding themselves as celebrities, indulging in self-intoxication, chanting about the wind and moon, and not knowing what they are saying. The above not only fails to live up to the sanctity of literature and art, and tarnishes the dignity of writers; but it is also absurd and ridiculous, and ultimately creates a spiritual famine for the masses. Therefore, to adapt to the needs of the objective environment, it is even more necessary to publish a periodical.

Therefore, after repeated resolutions by the board of directors and the standing committee, we resolutely decided to prepare a purely literary monthly magazine in order to accept the demands of members, meet the needs of readers, and fulfill the mission of the association, and achieve the association's purpose.

Some words have already been said in the association's founding declaration, and it is still worthwhile to repeat them—

As literary writers who are spiritual technicians, it seems that they should first bear the responsibility of spiritual education, be loyal to literature and art, be loyal to life experiences, be loyal to the freedom of writing; and jointly establish new writing beliefs and new literary styles. — This was the motivation for the organization of the association a year ago, and it has become the common belief of the members over the past year; today, a year later, under this common belief, the trial issue of this publication was born; with the birth of the trial issue, the future goals of this publication have also been established;

First, promote national literature and art
Second, create literature and art of the times
Third, promote literary and artistic construction
Fourth, improve the level of literature and art

Before these four goals, this publication will not only shake hands with established writers who have been writing for decades but also shake hands with young friends who are eager to learn and have a bright future. We oppose sectarianism and have no prejudices. This publication will not only serve as a publication shared by members, but we also hope that all comrades across the country who are loyal to literature and art will regard it as a public garden for literature and art.

Today, we respectfully meet readers with a trial attitude, and especially sincerely await readers' guidance and assistance.

Recent World Literary Scene Zhao Jingshen

Psychological Novelist Proust

Recently, Justin O'Brien talked about the great French psychological novelist Marcel Proust in the New York Times Book Review, roughly saying: Twenty-six years ago, on November 18, 1922, Proust died in Paris. It is said that he knew that his death was approaching, and instructed his loyal servant Celeste to hand over his unfinished manuscript to him, which was the section describing the death of the novelist Bergotte. In his last moments of suffering, Proust added a section, the final conclusion of which was: "They buried him, but in the bright windows, throughout the night of mourning, his books were arranged three by three, as if angels had spread their wings, seemingly a symbol of his resurrection, although he was already dead."

The imaginary novelist Bergotte created by Proust mostly symbolized himself "not completely dead". He did think of himself. His own masterpiece "In Search of Lost Time" has been published in ten volumes. It was not until five years after his death that the final part of this great work was published.

According to his theory, the "past" does not die, but it also does not exist faithfully, like a charcoal drawing, but rather as a flying impression of consciousness. In the first few volumes, he narrated the story of Swann falling in love with a worthless Odette. He used lengthy passages to analyze the psychology of love and jealousy, included in "Swann's Way". He also narrated homosexual love in "Cities of the Plain".

Proust's death at the age of fifty-one seems particularly unfortunate. Of the three veterans of French literature at the same time as him, two were older than him, Claudel and Gide, were still alive and continued to write; Paul Valery, who was younger than him, continued to write until his death in 1945. If he were still alive, he should have had even greater achievements. Even if he could not produce other works, he could at least revise his great work more completely. Many manuscripts had not been revised by him. In 1913, Proust revised a 1,500-page manuscript into 4,000 pages. This ratio is terrible. If he had lived to be seventy years old, his masterpiece must have been greatly revised.

The period from Proust's death in 1922 to the publication of the final volume of his masterpiece in 1927 was the peak of his reputation. His works have been translated into various languages.

Shortly after Proust's death, poems and short stories published in 1896 were reprinted and published. In 1927, his occasional magazine articles were also compiled and published. There were also several researchers who compiled indexes for his novels. And there were several researchers who wrote biographies for him.

In 1940, a young American scholar, D. W. Alden, studied Proust and found a total of 1,700 articles of various lengths from 1913 to 1938. The topics discussed varied, some talking about music, painting, memory, Jews, high society, etc., and others talking about style, aesthetic structure, impressionism, and the application of lessons, etc.

Proust's death gave researchers a lot of material, some talking about the geography in his novels, and others talking about the impact of asthma on his works. At the same time, the publication of Proust's seven volumes of letters also provided convenience for research. However, these letters were quite unfavorable to Proust, showing that the author was very selfish, too snobbish, and insincere, completely disproportionate to the broad spirit of his works. Reviewers also felt that Proust only wrote about high society, which was inevitably narrow in scope.

Now fewer people know Proust, because, first, his works are now not easily available; second, people do not have the leisure to read such a large work; third, what he wrote about are the leisure classes, which are disliked by modern youth. But he is still worthy of commemoration, his psychological analysis, his keen observation, and his delicate writing are all commendable.

He said at the end of his masterpiece: "Undoubtedly, my book, like me, will eventually die one day. But one should abandon the idea of death. We acknowledge that the bones after ten years, and the paintings after a hundred years, no longer exist. The immortality of books and people is not an easy thing." We hope that his works will one day be able to be resurrected and receive universal recognition and appreciation.

Hesse's Demian

Swiss writer Hermann Hesse won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1946. Twenty-eight years ago, he wrote a novel "Demian". In the early 1920s, World War I was still a traumatic experience, reason seemed to have gone bankrupt, and Freud's exploration, in the eyes of some people, was enough to prove that the old truths were inappropriate. This novel had a deep impact on the young intellectual class in Europe, and even had an impact in the United States.

It stirred readers with its revolutionary attitude towards good and evil, it predicted general insight (Demian said: "The world as it is now should die, should perish, and must die."), it refused to use old ways of thinking and acting, and was almost inhumane. The individual is higher than society, and fate is higher than maxims. One of the characters in the book said: "His only wish is to let fate do its thing. He has no relatives, stands alone, only cold space surrounds him."

Looking at it today, the story in "Demian" is not very new, but it is still fresh. The story begins in 1890 and ends in 1914, narrating the childhood and adolescence of Emil Sinclair.

The first half of the book is a brilliant record of student life experience. He was enslaved by swindling bullies, and was also a slave to Demian. Demian became his angel and devil. He gradually understood the difference between the dark world (the unknowable and unspeakable) and the bright world (the knowable and speakable). This half is written fresh, solid and clever.

The life in the second half of the book is richer and stranger than the first half. Symbolic dreams and paintings, news and revelries in the basement of the chapel, and outstanding relationships form a thread of self and fate. The light of the story gradually becomes eerie, leaving only the heat and flash of the early years.

Free Talk "Daylight Saving Time" Wu Yong

"Daylight Saving Time," also known as "Daylight Saving Time." The author has done some thinking on these two names, and after thinking, could not understand them, so he further asked friends for advice. After asking for advice, he was still not very satisfied with his friends' explanations. Thinking that this system may have originated in the West, he checked the dictionary. The author is a poor scholar and does not have many dictionaries. He is also ashamed of not being able to "master several languages", so he had to check the English dictionary. After checking, he found that the term "Daylight Saving Time" was not available in older dictionaries. Only in a newly published English-Chinese dictionary did he find the term "Daylight-saving time." According to its annotation, this plan originated in the United States, which is "Daylight Saving Time." The method is to "set the clock one hour ahead of standard time, starting in early summer; and set it back one hour in autumn." The author already knew this. What I am looking for is not the meaning of this system, but the purpose of this system, but the dictionary does not have a detailed explanation of this point.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the enemy also implemented "Daylight Saving Time" in the occupied areas during the transition from spring to summer. At that time, many people suspected that this was "Tokyo Time", so they felt "not surprised". However, even today, there must be many people like the author who do not understand the purpose of this method. We want to ask: What are the benefits of implementing this method and setting the clock forward one hour?

The so-called "setting the clock forward one hour" means that if the original standard time is 8:00 am, then according to Daylight Saving Time, it is 9:00 am. If the office hours of people working in offices in the city are from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, then they should get up one hour earlier than the standard time to go to the office, and they can get off work one hour earlier than the original time in the afternoon. Getting up one hour earlier in the morning can be compensated for by going to bed one hour earlier at night, so it doesn't matter; getting off work one hour earlier in the afternoon provides many conveniences for handling personal affairs. Because when you walk out of the office, you look up and see that the sky is still early, and there are still three or four hours before dark, so you can visit relatives and friends, or wander around the streets, or at least go home early to rest. But this is only for personal convenience. If it is only for this point, I think it is not necessary to implement Daylight Saving Time and order the whole country to comply.

Some say that the implementation of Daylight Saving Time is to make people across the country work one hour more. In other words, those who used to work eight hours now have to work nine hours, that is, office hours are brought forward one hour, and the time for getting off work is not brought forward. This intention is originally very good, but in fact, it is not necessarily done this way. Secondly, even if you want to ask people to work one hour more, you can extend office hours by one hour, so why bother setting the clock forward one hour?

Some say that setting the clock forward one hour means getting off work one hour earlier, and the intention is to save electricity. This statement does not match the facts. There is a saying among Chinese people: "The lungs should sleep on the night of the Winter Solstice, and play on the day of the Summer Solstice." This means that the winter nights are long and the days are short, while the summer days are long and the nights are short. As far as China's geographical location on the earth is concerned, this is indeed the case. In winter, it is already dusk at 5:00 pm, while in summer, although it is almost 7:00 pm according to standard time, the sky is still not dark. It can be seen that the implementation of Daylight Saving Time is at least irrelevant to saving electricity in our country. Moreover, in terms of the length of days and nights, it is more reasonable to implement this "Daylight Saving Time" method in winter, because this can avoid the disadvantage of the sky being dark when getting off work at 5:00 pm, and it can indeed achieve the practical effect of saving electricity.

The author's mind is simple and his knowledge is limited. After thinking about it, he really can't figure out the purpose of "Daylight Saving Time". Of course, the disadvantages of implementing "Daylight Saving Time" are probably non-existent.

Doubts upon Doubts Mao Yi

I read a strange story in the newspaper about a bird carrying a lit cigarette to its nest, which burned down the nest and caused a fire in the house under the eaves, resulting in a loss of one hundred and fifty yuan. The newspaper's report ends there. But this seems to leave a big void for me. (Editor's note: Please refer to the article "Coincidence" published in this publication on April 30.)

Countless questions welled up in my heart, the first of which was naturally: What exactly happened? Did the bird want to warm its nest with the cigarette butt? What kind of cigarette was it? How did the bird get it? Did it peck it from the smoker's mouth, hand, or ashtray? If it belonged to the latter and the ashtray was in the room, how did the bird fly in? And how did it fly out?

Does the bird smoke like ordinary people? Or did it just hold it in its mouth? Did any passers-by see it flying by with a cigarette in its mouth? Did it sincerely want to burn down the nest? Burn down the house it depended on? Did it hate the landlord? Did it mistake the cigarette butt for a hot worm? Or a firefly? Does this prove that it is nearsighted? Or is it just stupid?

If its cigarette butt was snatched from a person's mouth or hand, what was the reaction of the person who was snatched? Anger? Shock? What did he, or she, do? Did they exclaim "Hey"? Or did they pounce on the bird? Or did they light another cigarette and say; "I bet that stupid bird is going to throw the cigarette butt into its nest and cause a fire that costs one hundred and fifty dollars"?

I am sorry to be so curious here, but Voltaire, or Oscar Wilde, or perhaps another great writer once said: "Asking the right questions that even you cannot answer is a great thing." If so, I may be doing well. (Written by Party)

An Opportunity Mei Bai

The National Games have opened. Our China seems to have become a country that is best at holding meetings, but this meeting is full of vitality and different from others—it will neither make all kinds of jokes in order to canvass votes, nor will it pass countless resolutions that specialize in writing current affairs clichés and consider it a complete success. In this respect, the National Games should indeed be the most "clean" meeting.

But we cannot ignore the significance of the National Games from another perspective. In today's turbulent times, judging from the enthusiastic participation of representatives from remote provinces and overseas Chinese, the National Games can very well play a role in increasing "centripetal force".

If the government wants to make "the world submit", this is an opportunity. However, if this opportunity is not well utilized, what could have been "the world submitting" may change into "widespread grievances", thus producing very serious consequences. Therefore, the people who are in charge of this National Games have a considerable responsibility.

In fact, many of the overseas Chinese units that returned to participate this time are attending the National Games for the first time. In this eventful time for the motherland, they do not hesitate to travel long distances to return and share the grand event. How should we warmly receive them to express our concern for distant people! But in fact, after the athletes from Taiwan and Xinjiang entered the dormitory, the National Games authorities never even sent a staff member to take care of them! According to what I know for sure, on the first night after the athletes from Taiwan entered, they were tired from the journey and urgently needed to rest. No one greeted them in the dormitory, so they had to move their bedding and prepare to sleep on their own; but at this time, the owner of the dormitory suddenly declared that this large room was not included in the dormitory and asked the athletes to move out immediately! Finally, it was only after repeated requests from the person in charge of the Taiwan delegation that they were temporarily allowed to stay overnight. The next day, the athletes had to carry their bedding and move again on their own! The compatriots from Taiwan never said a word of complaint, and they were considerate of the National Games everywhere. I don't know what excuses the National Games authorities will come up with, but we only feel ashamed—because we ordinary people would never be so rude to a brother returning from afar: in a time of widespread war, when we reunite after a long separation, we should have a good time talking about it. I will use everything I have to welcome him. How can I be indifferent to him at first and then drive him out in the middle of the night?

If the person in charge of the National Games clearly understands the righteousness and is aware of the importance of his responsibility, he should always come out with the frank spirit of a mobilizer and resolutely apologize to the athletes from Taiwan!

We cannot allow a "clean" meeting to leave any slight stains, we cannot lightly let go of any opportunity to strive for "centripetal force"—we should even more give play to the spirit of friendship and generosity of our country's tradition!

A Trap Lei Ying

When I was young, I read martial arts novels such as Seven Heroes and Five Gallants, and I was often fascinated by the many "mechanisms" for catching people, such as "Chongxiao Thread" and "Copper Net Array", and felt that they were mysterious and unpredictable, and very interesting.

Unexpectedly, today I saw a piece of news in an American publication and discovered an inventor who specializes in installing "news" and "mechanisms". He is W. Moore from Carlo, Michigan, USA. He has recently installed all the "mechanisms" in his house. No matter how great your skills are, if you break into this house at night, you will not be able to escape!

These "mechanisms" are like this: as soon as a stranger enters, the "mechanism" is activated, and all the lights in the house immediately turn on, the doors of every room are automatically locked, and at the same time, the telephone bureau also receives a warning call, and the police bells in the police station ring loudly!

Mr. Moore is waiting for a burglar to come, but unfortunately, his wish has not yet been fulfilled.

Two Painters in Six Chapters of a Floating Life

Six Chapters of a Floating Life has been promoted by Lin Yutang and Yu Pingbo, and brought to the stage and the screen. People south of the Yangtze River almost all know Shen Sanbai. Yu Pingbo said: "The wonderful thing about this book is not that it is vividly similar, but that it achieves vivid similarity without any effort; the beautiful thing about it is not that it is beautiful, but that it seems to have nothing else besides beauty. It is like a pure crystal, only seeing the crystal clear, not seeing the color that sets off the crystal clear; only seeing the subtle, not seeing the traces of making the subtle." The argument is pertinent. To focus solely on the excellence of the article is short-sighted. Is Sanbai also a heartbroken person throughout the ages? If the virtuous couple had lived to old age together, how could this Six Chapters have been written? "Idle Sentiments" records three painters in Xiaoshuang Tower, who are famous painters from the Wu region. The following is a brief biography of the three painters for readers' reference:

Yang Changxu, style name Bufan, sobriquet Fenghuangshan Ren, a native of Changzhou, a national student, good at landscape painting, with a rich and elegant style. He once went to Miao territory, fully appreciating the strange and beautiful scenery. Later, he was a guest at Ruan Yuan's Langhuan Xianguan, traveling with various celebrities, and his painting skills improved. The scholars and women imitated Liu Ru, with an elegant and rhythmic style.

Yuan Pei, style name Shaoyu, Yuezi, his landscape paintings are clear, plump, elegant and beautiful, and he is especially famous in the capital, and his calligraphy is rounded.

Wang Yan, style name Xinglan, a top student of Miao Chun, his flower paintings are meticulous, and his birds and animals are lifelike. (Wu Wenxun)

Writers' Anecdotes Jin Lin

Alexandre Dumas, the author of "The Three Musketeers", which shook the world, could not write novels without blue paper, could not write poetry without yellow paper, and if he wanted to write a short essay, he had to use rose-colored paper.

He never used blue ink. And when he wrote plays, he had to lie on the sofa with a soft pillow under his elbow to get inspiration.

H.G. Wells suffered a serious injury from being trampled on while working as a soccer referee. He lived a painful life for twelve years, but he also became a world-renowned celebrity because of this.

He did not have a fixed place to write. He would write in his London office, in his car, or on the Mediterranean coast. And when a thought suddenly came to his mind, he would immediately write it down in his notebook.

Sleeping Too Much Is Not Beneficial He Dao

Many people think that if their bodies are unwell, they should sleep more. However, according to the results of recent research by several authoritative medical circles, sleeping too much is not only not beneficial, but it can even cause other problems! British medical authority Dr. Asher recently warned doctors: "Before we tell patients to sleep, we must consider carefully; we must know that although soft bedding is quite comfortable, the harm of sleeping too much is quite terrible."

Dr. Asher said that sleeping too much can cause lung disease, or make the original lung disease worse. It can also make skin diseases more serious, can make muscles gradually lose their mobility, can cause joint pain, and can also cause kidney disease, stomach disease, heart disease, and nervous disorders.

For example, when a person is lying in bed, of course, they will not move much, and they will often maintain the same posture. This can cause the secretions in the body's glands to collect in the trachea, which can easily lead to insomnia. If a person has lung disease, after lying in bed, because there is no exercise, the amount of breathing is reduced, and the diseased lungs are not easy to recover.

But Dr. Asher believes that the most terrible thing is the impact of sleeping too much on blood vessels. The reduction in muscle movement slows down blood circulation due to lack of stimulation, which can cause the blood to clot, which can cause blood vessels to become inflamed—this is a fatal condition. Medical scientists have studied patients with this type of blood clot disease and found that 53% of the patients had been bedridden for a long time.

After sleeping too much, the movement of the bones is greatly reduced, and if the bones are not moved, the calcium in the bones will slowly flow away, which is especially dangerous for the elderly. This calcium often flows into the kidneys, so the amount of calcium in the urine increases, which can easily cause kidney stones. There is also a terrible condition that is easy to cause: urinary retention.

Sleeping too much can also easily cause constipation and liver and stomach pain, which are dangerous for the elderly. And the dust raised when folding bedding in bed is even more harmful to the lungs.

However, Dr. Asher also solemnly declared that he is not simply opposed to patients sleeping. Sleeping can indeed be beneficial to treatment, but you must not sleep too much. He believes that "sleeping" is like other drugs, and should be prescribed by a doctor, allowing the doctor to decide whether you need to sleep and how long you should sleep. (Translator's note: Dr. Asher's original name is D.R.A.J. Asher, and this article is taken from an article published by Asher in the British Medical Journal.)

Jin Hui's father, Prince Su Shanqi of the Qing Dynasty, was granted the hereditary title of nobility for his meritorious service in the early Qing Dynasty, the so-called "Iron Hat Prince". By the end of the Qing Dynasty, he was a distant branch. In the old capital, there were many such princes and nobles, and no one paid attention to them. However, Shanqi was appointed Minister of Civil Affairs because he knew about the new policies and was aware of current affairs. This was because the Qing court suddenly realized the need to promote reform after the Boxer Rebellion. Among the imperial clan nobles, many were ignorant, but Shanqi was the first to understand the trend and had long studied it. He also sent his children to study in Japan, and thus stood out among the nobles. He was also very fond of elegance, and put his heart into calligraphy, painting, and opera. He could perform martial arts operas and was a good friend of the martial artist Yu Zhenting. His calligraphy was painstakingly learned from Liu Shi'an, and his colleague Wu Zhen (Vice Minister of Civil Affairs) had it printed into a small booklet and asked the famous Hanlin scholar Xu Huanong (Qi) to write a title and poems for it. Shanqi himself titled it "Imitation of Liu Wenqing Gong", and also titled it, "Named imitation, but in reality, it is not similar." He really had self-awareness. Liu Yong's calligraphy, "cotton with needles inside", was not easy to learn, and scholars often made it bloated, clumsy, ugly. Although Shanqi's imitation was not similar, it had no vulgar style and was not very annoying. Xu Huanong (

### 29th Anniversary of the May Fourth Movement Commemorated by Cultural Circles; Shanghai Literary and Art Association Holds First Annual Meeting Simultaneously; Two Major Goals Still Awaiting National Effort for Promotion and Development

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday marked the 29th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. The Shanghai Municipal Cultural Movement Committee and the Literary and Art Writers Association held a May Fourth Commemoration Meeting and the First Annual Meeting of the Shanghai Writers Association at the Cultural Hall at 9:00 AM. Those attending included Pan Gongzhan, Fang Zhi, Zhu Jingnong, Ye Suzhong, Yu Wen, Wang Jin　, Yan Duhhe, Ma Gongyu, Xu Weinan, Xu Zhongnian, and over ten thousand people from cultural and literary circles, with Pan Gongzhan serving as the general chairman. After the meeting began, Pan delivered a speech, stating that the May Fourth Movement was a deep-rooted patriotic movement that manifested the spirit of democracy in politics and created a new cultural movement in culture. The slogan at the time was "Science and Democracy," but after nearly thirty years, the achievements in science and democracy are still unsatisfactory. Therefore, cultural circles commemorating the May Fourth Movement should work together to awaken society's attention to science to seek creation and development. In terms of democracy, although China currently has democratic forms, the promotion of democracy lies in the spirit of democracy, that is, the expression of accommodating opinions and making decisions by the majority. He hoped that people in cultural circles would work hard to promote it. Fang Zhi then spoke about the historical significance and value of the May Fourth Movement. Zhu Jingnong spoke about the gains of the May Fourth New Cultural Movement. Luo Dunwei and Yi Junzuo successively spoke about the achievements of the May Fourth Movement in reforming Chinese literature and art. The Writers Association then reported on its activities, discussed proposals, and passed resolutions to send congratulatory messages to Chairman Chiang and Director Li on their election as the first President and Vice President of the Republic of China. Then the Kunlun Company's new film "New Grievances" was screened. After the meeting, a literary and art gathering and cocktail party were held at the Literary and Art Lounge. The Writers Association also distributed the newly published trial issue of "Literary and Art Magazine" on the spot.

### Cause of Death in Oil Tanker Double Homicide Case Highly Suspicious; Ship Sailed Before Detailed Interrogation; Telegram Sent Requesting Detention and Return to Shanghai for Further Investigation

Regarding the "Charles M. Yerkes" oil tanker, on which a large quantity of opium and corpses were found, the Ministry of the Interior and the Opium Prohibition Committee telegraphed the customs to request that the ship be detained. It is understood that the ship hurriedly left Shanghai for Hong Kong the other day and sailed directly to the Bulungan area of Borneo. According to sources concerned, the captain of the ship claimed that the smuggling of opium was carried out by two deceased Chinese sailors. After research and investigation by the Customs Anti-Smuggling Bureau and the Police Bureau, it was unanimously believed that the two poor sailors definitely did not have the resources to independently manage this unprecedentedly large quantity of drugs. The evidence is lacking regarding the poisoning deaths of the two sailors in the water tank, and there was a lack of material evidence during the burial at sea.

### County Corpse's Rope Did Not Reach Bottom of Hold

As a result of careful investigation, a very important piece of evidence has recently been discovered, namely, that the rope tied to the deceased sailor was not long enough to reach the bottom of the hold, causing the corpse to hang in the air above the deck. When the ship arrived in Shanghai, because the ship's sailors were of Chinese, English, American, Indian, and other nationalities, the English and American consulates and others conducted their own inquiries, so our authorities lacked sufficient time to conduct unhurried and detailed interrogations. The items in the deceased's room were not scientifically investigated. It is necessary to conduct a reinvestigation of the case to find out the truth. The authorities are currently trying to send a telegram to relevant overseas parties to detain the ship and escort it to Shanghai.

### Celluloid Store in Nanshi Catches Fire; Thrilling Jumping Scene; Young Girl Cleverly Seeks Help for Younger Brother

After hearing the news, the couple hurriedly took their young son and fled from the flames. The daughter was about to take her brother to follow them downstairs when, unfortunately, the stairs had already been burned down. In this critical moment, the girl, with quick wit, carried her brother to the window facing the street and shouted for help. At that time, many passersby were gathered on the street. Seeing the situation, they all held out their hands and told her to throw her brother out of the window. The girl obeyed and threw him out, and the four-year-old boy was safely caught by the passersby. The girl then jumped out of the window, only breaking her waist. At that time, the Xinkaihe Fire Brigade had heard the alarm and dispatched vehicles to the scene. In addition to sending the girl to the hospital immediately, they bravely fought the fire and extinguished it after half an hour. In addition to No. 51 being mostly destroyed, No. 53, Shengtai Chang Celluloid Store next door, was also partially destroyed.

### Airport Police Greatly Surprised: Hitler and Mussolini Arrive in Shanghai Together from the Philippines

[Reported by this newspaper] On the 1st of this month, Hitler and Mussolini arrived in Shanghai together on a Northwest Airlines plane from Manila.

Could Mussolini, who died in the streets of Milan, have been resurrected? Could the enigmatic Hitler really not have died? When customs officers at Longhua Airport saw these two names on the passenger list that day, they were as surprised as the readers of this newspaper are today.

The plane arrived, and customs officers and police rushed forward. They looked around to see if there really was that disheveled, mustachioed Hitler and that bald Mussolini with a face full of fat. They were disappointed. Suddenly, two Filipino children walked over. The older one introduced himself, saying, "I am Hitler, and that is my brother Mussolini."

Hitler is eleven years old this year, and Mussolini is ten years old this year. Their full names are Napoleon Hitler Tilla and Kaiser Mussolini Tilla. They are the sons of the Tilla couple. This family: the Tilla couple, Hitler, Mussolini, and a little girl named Joan, are traveling from Manila to the United States via Shanghai for sightseeing. Their final destination is Spain. There are probably many more children with such names in Spain.

### Special Criminal Court Secretly Tries Dance Hall Riot Case; Defendants Deny Vandalizing Social Affairs Bureau

[Reported by this newspaper] After the dance hall employees and dancers' riot at the Social Affairs Bureau was transferred to the Special Criminal Court for trial by the Police Bureau, the Special Criminal Court previously secretly interrogated more than 30 defendants, including Hong Xiaoping, who were in custody.
