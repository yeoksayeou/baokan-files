Liaoxi Bandit Battalion Commander, Yang Rongji, Defects

Hopes for an early end to banditry and the rebuilding of homes.

[Our Newspaper, Jinzhou, 7th] Yang Rongji, the second battalion commander of the Liaoxi Independent First Regiment of bandits, recently led two companies of soldiers, bringing their weapons to surrender. It is said that the motivation for escaping the bandit area was a deep disgust with the inconsistency of the bandits' words and deeds. He was originally a wealthy Hui farmer from Jianping, Rehe Province. The bandits induced him to collect firearms and form a Hui militia, promising to protect his family property. After the Hui militia was formed, it was repeatedly assigned arduous and sacrificial tasks, and later reorganized into a field army. However, despite their desperate efforts, their family property was still divided. Most young and able-bodied members of farming families who produced a small surplus were forced to join the army, leaving no one to cultivate the fields. Middle-class farmers were even more anxious. Popular resentment deepened day by day, ultimately leading them to defect with their troops, hoping to rebuild their homes after an early end to the banditry.

Boundary Markers Erected on the Yunnan-Burma Border

Survey Work Completed

Survey Work for Undefined Borders to Proceed After Autumn

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The survey work on the Sino-Burmese border in the Yunnan-Burma border area has been completed. The Ministry of Interior's boundary survey team, under the leadership of Chuan Jiao Jin, Director of the Department of Internal Regional Affairs, completed the work and returned to the capital on the 6th. The team departed from the capital in late December of last year. The work lasted more than seven months, surveying the area from Beimu Jian Gaoshan in the north to the Nanding River in the south. The Sino-Burmese border is 420 kilometers long. The survey was conducted by two teams. The first team, led by Fu Bingchun, proceeded north from the Nanding River. The second team, led by Huang Bairui, proceeded south from Jian Gaoshan. They met near the Ruili River in early July, completing the work. Chuan told reporters on the 7th with a pleased expression: The greatest achievement of this project is that, in addition to correcting the existing maps of the national border, 135 boundary marker maps at a scale of 1:5000 were surveyed, and over a thousand photos were taken. Every boundary marker has a very detailed record. Chuan also told reporters: This survey work is divided into three parts. The first is the survey of the border where boundary markers have already been erected, which has now been completed. The second is the survey of the defined border where boundary markers have not yet been erected. The third is the survey of the undefined border. Problems such as the Savage Mountain and Jiangxinpo belong to the survey of undefined borders. This part of the work will not proceed until after this autumn. Although the team's work has been successfully completed, it encountered many difficulties during the process, such as remote locations with sparse populations, language barriers, poor climate, and medical difficulties. Fortunately, it received assistance and enthusiastic welcomes from local people in the areas it passed through, which solved countless difficulties and enabled the mission to be accomplished.

Defense Ministry Issues Mid-Year War Situation Review

Although Bandit Army's Rampant Disturbances Have Achieved Considerable Development

The Fundamental Attempt to Cross the Yangtze River Was Smashed by the National Army

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th] The Ministry of National Defense recently issued a "Mid-Year War Situation Review." The full text is as follows:

(1) The Bandit's Intentions

Beginning in December of last year, Zhu Mao and other bandits had already determined their operational policy for this year, wanting the Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi bandit corps to actively advance south, preparing to cross the Yangtze River in May. At the same time, they wanted Peng Dehuai to disturb Shaanxi and eastern Gansu as a support, Xu Xiangqian to control Shanxi, Nie Rongzhen to contain North China, and Lin Biao to dispatch personnel into the pass as a backing as the situation demanded. Beginning in early February, they launched a so-called spring offensive, and in May, they launched a summer offensive. On the one hand, they tried their best to destroy railway transportation, destroy villages and cities, and consume the combat power of the National Army. On the other hand, they strengthened military recruitment and seized grain, continuing the three "requests" tactics of seeking soldiers, food, and combat to strengthen the bandit army.

(2) The Bandit's Deployment

First, starting from North China, they unified the military and political organizations of the North China bandits, with the five columns of the Nie Rongzhen bandit forces disturbing the Pingbao and Pinghuan lines, propagandizing the reception of the Lin bandit forces into the pass, implementing a feint to the east and attack to the west, covering the five columns of the Peng Dehuai bandit forces disturbing northern Shaanxi and northern Wei, and the four columns of Xu Xiangqian besieging Linfen and Taiyuan. The eight columns of Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng and other bandits besieged Luoyang, an important town in western Henan. The fourteen columns of the Chen Yi bandit forces were resting and reorganizing separately in eastern Jiaodong, northern Jiangsu, western Shandong, and western Henan, in order to implement a large-scale battle in the Central Plains as the first decisive battle. The more than 500,000 of the Lin Biao bandit forces in the Northeast, in addition to sending three columns into the border area of Hebei, Rehe, and Liaoning to assist the Nie bandits in destroying the Beining Railway, attempting to open up the Liaore Corridor without success, most were reorganizing in the northern Liaoning area, waiting to launch an offensive in the autumn.

(3) The National Army's Bandit Suppression Policy

Because the National Army's government strategy is to simultaneously advance the suppression of rebellion, the implementation of constitutional government, and the building of the nation, militarily, it seeks stability in the Northeast, strives for consolidation in North China, blocks bandit expansion in the Northwest, and strengthens suppression in East China and Central China, on the one hand blocking the bandits from advancing south, and on the other hand attacking the main force of the bandits. This policy, due to the need for time to implement constitutional government and build the nation, strategically cannot but adopt a long-term rebellion suppression policy. The National Army's adoption of such a policy is correct, because today's bandit suppression in China has become a link in the future international situation.

(4) Mid-Year War Situation

In the fighting of the past six months, the bandit's rampant disturbances have achieved considerable development. Although the bandits have made no progress in the Northeast and North China, in Shandong, Shanxi, northern Shaanxi, western Henan, eastern Henan, western Shandong, northern Jiangsu, northern Hubei, northern Anhui, and other places, the bandits have achieved considerable success in destroying transportation, seizing grain and supplies, expanding the army, and expanding the areas of wandering. Although the bandit's fundamental intention—the goal of crossing the Yangtze River—has not been realized, and they have paid the price of more than 710,500 casualties, the bandit's development has seemed to reach its peak.

During this period, the National Army, due to the dedication of its officers and soldiers, and the brave fighting of its troops, achieved the goals of stabilizing the Northeast, consolidating North China, securing the Northwest, and blocking the bandit's southward advance and crossing of the Yangtze River, completing the difficult task of preparing for constitutional government, reforming, planning, and construction politically. However, the National Army also lost 217,552 officers and soldiers, and abandoned 89 county towns both inside and outside the customs, with some having been gained and lost up to seven times, causing more than ten million people to migrate and be displaced. These facts and lessons are the reasons for today's national hatred of the enemy.

(5) Comparison of Strengths

Although the bandit's casualties are extremely heavy, with almost one-third of the columns having been replenished and reorganized three times in the past six months, the loss of old cadres and veterans is even greater. However, the number of bandits is still increasing. The bandit leader Zhu De said that they already have 2.4 million troops (including 800,000 militiamen). Although this is close to exaggeration, it can also be imagined the suffering of the people in the bandit area. The bandit army's lack of grain, ammunition, and equipment is an undeniable fact. The National Army is limited by its organization, budget, and limited expansion of troops. The training time for supplementary soldiers and reserve soldiers is longer. In the past, the ratio of the National Army to bandits was three to one, but today it may soon become two to one. However, the National Army has air force equipment, supplies, and cadres that are superior to the bandits. The National Army still has great confidence in defeating the bandits with its strength and achieving victory. In the past six months, Peng Dehuai's disastrous defeat in northern Wei, Liu Bocheng's bandit attack on Nanyang failed, and Chen Yi's losses in the Central Plains battle were extremely heavy, damaging his vitality and reducing his strength. The bandit's morale has been gradually declining. The bandits who surrender are eager to voluntarily join the ranks of the National Army. This is powerful proof. (To be continued)

State-Owned Enterprise Assets

Sold According to Original Plan

Listed as an Important Measure in Economic Plan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] In order to tighten the currency and increase national treasury revenue, the Ministry of Finance has decided to proceed with the sale of state-owned enterprise assets according to the original plan, and has decided to first sell the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Regarding the technical issues of the sale, the Ministry of Finance convened representatives from the Ministry of Transportation's Maritime Affairs Bureau and the Central Bank a few days ago to conduct consultations. According to well-informed sources, Wang Yunwu is paying close attention to this matter and has decided to actively strengthen its implementation. In the Weng cabinet's new economic and financial policy plan, the sale of state-owned enterprise assets will be listed as an important part of it.

Song Ziwen Arrives in Beijing from Shanghai

Visits the President for a Long Talk and Meets with Premier Weng

Decided to Urge the Hong Kong Government to Implement the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] Song Ziwen, Director of the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters and Chairman of Guangdong, flew to Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 7th at about 10:00 am on the President's special plane. He went to the Beijige official residence for a short rest, and at about 11:00 am drove to the Huangpu Road official residence to visit the President, reporting on the economic construction, political economy, and local security situation in South China, and answering the President's questions. After having lunch together, he left at about 2:00 pm. At 3:00 pm, he went to meet with Premier Weng Wenhao for a long talk. Song's visit to Beijing this time, summoned by the President's telegram, was to answer the President's questions on economic issues. Before Song came to Beijing, he went to Hong Kong. It is generally believed that his visit is related to promoting the implementation of the previously signed Sino-Hong Kong agreement by the Hong Kong government, and it is said that Song's opinion is to implement it with the most decisive determination, so that the Hong Kong government can quickly implement the agreement. Secondly, Song's mission will be to seek US aid to build South China. As for the rumor that Song is making a comeback and reorganizing the cabinet, reporters have visited well-informed people in political circles, and they all believe that it is just a rumor, and it is obviously impossible for Song to come out and reorganize the cabinet at this time.

Weekly Forum: Basic Principles of Currency Reform by He Shiqi

Currency, as a medium of exchange and a standard of prices, is of utmost importance to the daily lives of the people. To maintain social stability, the purchasing power of currency relative to real goods should be reliably maintained at a fixed level. Since inflation began in our country, the value of currency has been declining daily, leading to a widespread psychology of valuing goods over currency. This is not only the case among the people, but the government is also in a leading position, with fixed-price loans secured by real estate being a prominent example. Furthermore, phenomena such as using gold bars to buy houses and pricing wages and tuition in terms of rice are countless. These are all blatant expressions of the lack of confidence in the current legal tender. One should not refuse treatment for fear of disease. Therefore, currency reform, as it stands, is only a matter of time. How to succeed is what we should carefully study.

Regarding opinions on currency reform, many scholars have expressed their views. Some focus on the selection and preparation of new standards, some plan methods for recovering the old legal tender and issuing new currency, and others pay attention to the connection between the new currency and foreign exchange and gold. However, the author believes that if we truly want to start from the root, we cannot ignore two basic principles: one is the balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure, and the other is the independence of currency issuance. If the above two points cannot be achieved, then currency reform will only be a measure of changing units. The result will only be a change in units. Although it can provide temporary convenience, it will become ineffective after a period of time and cannot maintain the lasting credibility of the currency. This kind of superficial reform only changes the name of the currency and is not a thorough reform of the system. Therefore, I will frankly discuss the two items of balancing finance and independent issuance as follows.

To achieve the goal of balancing fiscal revenue and expenditure, there is no other way than to start from the two aspects of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. However, our country has been in frequent wars for years, and its vitality has been almost exhausted. Increasing revenue and reducing expenditure are both difficult. The salaries of soldiers and public school teachers are extremely meager, and their monthly income is not enough to maintain the lowest standard of living. How can they be extravagant and cut back? At present, the equipment of general institutions is mostly crude and simple, all due to a lack of funds. It is feared that this is not an object of austerity. Therefore, in our poor country, the path of reducing expenditure seems relatively narrow. However, if we must plan in this area, there is also a way to find it, that is, to eliminate redundant personnel, remove redundant institutions, prevent the import of luxury goods, and reduce unnecessary expenses. Only by being strict and thorough in implementation can it be beneficial. Secondly, in terms of increasing revenue, it is not without solutions, but our country's politics has not been put on the right track, and various obstacles are extremely large. Therefore, it is difficult for all measures to achieve the expected results. For example, the much-publicized special relief donation totaled only more than 10 trillion yuan, which is only equivalent to one-sixth of this year's May deficit, but many wealthy people are still reluctant to donate, resulting in an incomplete collection. Also, various tax revenues have been affected by changes in currency value, causing huge invisible losses to the national treasury. Furthermore, due to phenomena such as smuggling and tax evasion by unscrupulous merchants, and corruption and embezzlement by tax collectors, the tax system has become increasingly depressed. Taking the main tax, direct tax, as an example, the actual revenue last year only accounted for 3.3% of total expenditure. Compared with the 51% in the same year in the UK and the 75% in the United States, it is a world apart! All of this shows that the exhaustion of our country's financial resources is mainly due to human factors. At present, in reorganizing finances, in addition to eradicating the above-mentioned accumulated malpractices, we should also encourage production, guide idle funds, and absorb overseas remittances and foreign investment to enrich the national treasury's revenue.

Speaking of the independence of currency issuance, it is even more important. Since the September 18th Incident, the central government has vigorously implemented a unified issuance system, originally hoping that the Central Bank could fulfill its mission of independent issuance. The legal tender policy was thus established. However, because the war of resistance broke out not long after, war expenses increased sharply year by year, financial difficulties became increasingly tight, and unfavorable factors such as unsold public bonds and reduced tax revenue were added. At that time, the deficit could not but be made up by issuance. As a result, the Central Bank has not been able to control the power of issuance, and has consequently caused the current serious inflation and low currency credibility. Could this have been foreseen by those who advocated the reform of the legal tender at that time?

Since the harm of inflation is due to the inability to issue independently, when new currency is issued after the reform, the basic spirit of independent issuance must be adhered to, and it must be completely separated from finance. Furthermore, a Central Bank issuance inspection system should be vigorously implemented. Members of the Legislative Yuan, members of the Supervisory Yuan, and senators from the people's representative institutions, as well as representatives from chambers of commerce and banking associations in economic centers, should recommend several impartial representatives who are respected by the public to participate in the supervision and audit work, and report the reserve and total issuance to the people of the whole country at any time, so as to establish credibility. Secondly, the Central Bank's agency for national treasury business is to handle the government's financial expenditures and revenues, and it should absolutely avoid using currency issuance to make up for the fiscal deficit. Even if the budget revenue and expenditure cannot be balanced, and the national treasury has no funds to make up for it, it must apply for a loan from the Central Bank in accordance with extremely strict legal procedures. After approval, it must still provide property, materials, or reliable future income as collateral before it can temporarily overdraw. In this way, if the annual budget has a shortfall, a flexible margin can be obtained without affecting military and political affairs, and the government's inertia of completely relying on issuance for funding can also be eliminated. As for the currency increased by the Central Bank due to handling rediscounting and re-mortgaging, as long as the original loans can be recovered in full upon maturity, it should not have any adverse consequences for the issuance volume of the entire currency.

An independent issuance system can not only maintain a country's good currency credibility, but also demonstrate the soundness of a country's financial foundation. However, the main condition for an independent issuance system is that there must be sufficient reserves before a good currency credibility can be established. For example, around 1931, the banknotes issued by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications were well-prepared and had excellent credit. As a result, they were more popular than silver dollars, and there was a premium during exchange, which shows that the credibility of the currency does not depend on whether hard currency or banknotes are adopted. As for the issue of reserves when reforming the currency system, this article will not discuss it in detail.

Since the basic principles of currency reform are as described above, the technical application of it is also very important. If there is any negligence, it may lead to a complete mistake. For example, the failure of currency reform in France, Czechoslovakia, and other countries after the war is an example.

Secondly, in terms of our country's current legal tender system, it is not that the system itself is bad, but that the government authorities are using it improperly. The crux of the failure of the legal tender policy is that the monetary system and fiscal policy are not clearly distinguished. As the saying goes, "Learn from the past to avoid future mistakes." Bearing in mind the lessons of the failure of the legal tender, when reforming the currency in the future, we should be determined to reorganize finances and urge the Central Bank to make good use of social forces to strengthen its control over its issuance power, so as to maintain the dignity of independent issuance.

More than 9.2 million mu have been surveyed. This Ministry is planning to consult with the Ministry of National Defense, Agriculture and Forestry, and other ministries to develop military reclamation.

Daily commodity prices fluctuate again. The authorities discuss countermeasures to stabilize prices, deciding to tighten lending and massively sell commodities.

[Our Newspaper] Following the large daily outflows of the national banks, commodity prices have fluctuated again. In response, the Central Bank convened an emergency meeting yesterday morning to secretly discuss countermeasures. Chairman Liu Gongyun and heads of relevant departments attended. It was decided to tighten lending and remittance operations, and to massively sell commodities such as yarn and cloth, in order to tighten the money supply and curb the rising trend.

According to statistics, in recent days, the highest daily outflow from national banks has reached 7 trillion, and even at lower times, it has been more than 4-5 trillion. The main reason for the outflow is to pay for public funds for military and political organs, and to purchase flour and other materials. In terms of the latter, based on current price levels, it requires more than 20 trillion per month. As for other loans, they account for a small proportion of the outflow amount. Therefore, whether the effect of selling commodities such as yarn and cloth currently controlled by the Central Bank can offset this huge outflow is questionable. Relevant sources pointed out that the only possibility of tightening the money supply is the centralized use of US aid materials starting at the end of August.

Another report: Yesterday, the city's money market remained loose. The four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury had a large net outflow in the clearing of bills with the banking industry, totaling 297.93 billion. Among them, the Central Bank had a net outflow of 125.37 billion. The Bank of China had a net outflow of 19.09 billion. The Bank of Communications had a net outflow of 104.95 billion. The Farmers Bank of China had a net outflow of 11.28 billion. The China Trust Bureau had a net outflow of 4.05 billion. The Postal Remittance Bureau had a net inflow of 2.3 billion. The Central Cooperative Treasury had a net outflow of 3.342 billion. Commercial banks and firms had a large clearing net outflow of 3.675 billion. Small clearings had a net inflow of 18.277 billion. Foreign banks had a total net inflow of 15.191 billion.

Yarn prices generally rise. Trading in cotton cloth is very active.

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was stimulated by the loose money supply inside and outside the industry, which sparked buying sentiment. In addition, with reports of rising prices in other regions, merchants from other regions were very keen, and the market trend was particularly good, with a lively atmosphere.

42-count “Phoenix” fine yarn initially jumped to 200 million yuan upon opening. After opening, due to the strong rise in cotton cloth, demand was urgent, and the market surged again, creating a new high of 2.55 billion. Near closing, many sellers took profits, and buyers' interest waned. The final transaction was at 2.42 billion yuan, and the next transaction on Monday was at 2.47 billion yuan, an increase of 223 million yuan compared to the previous day.

21-count "Double Horse" yarn also jumped to 160 million upon opening. Later, due to brisk sales in other regions, merchants from Guangdong and Chaozhou were very keen, and the price rose again to 2.005 billion, finally closing at 2 billion. The transaction on Monday was at 2.004 billion yuan, an increase of 240-220 million compared to the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also rose by 100 million to 2-300 million, with 109 transactions.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was characterized by another large outflow from banks and bureaus, resulting in a very loose money supply. Although actual sales did not expand, dealers with ample funds bought in large quantities. At the same time, merchants from northern regions also absorbed goods, resulting in very active buying sentiment in the market.

12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth rose sharply by 5 million yuan upon opening. Because demand exceeded supply, the market continued to rise by 2.5 million yuan. Near closing, there were rumors unfavorable to bullish speculation, and with the decline in securities, new buyers stopped acting, and long positions were sold off. The market then fell to 71.5 million yuan, still a sharp rise of 7 million yuan compared to the previous day. However, the final price shouted outside the market was 71 million yuan for Monday delivery. Other fine cloths such as "Five Blessings" and "Trumpet Child," as well as drill, bleached cloth, and Shilin cloth, all rose by 10% to 15%. 1280 bolts were traded.

Another report: Yesterday, the China Textile Corporation sold 15 bales of cotton yarn. 20 purchase permits were issued to factories. 34,707 bolts of cotton cloth were sold. 732 purchase permits were issued to cloth merchants. 35,120 bolts of cotton cloth and 210 blankets were sold. A total of 752 purchase permits were issued. 38,590 dan of cotton and 210 blankets were sold, with a total value of 229,494,200,000 yuan. In addition, the China Textile Corporation, on behalf of the Yarn Control Committee, sold eight types of cotton yarn on the cotton yarn market, totaling 9,213 pieces to 276 customers, with a total value of 154,761,000,000 yuan.

US Consultant to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Mr. Dade, expresses his opinion.
After the Yarn Control Committee is abolished, there should be a substitute organization.

US Consultant to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Mr. Dade, expresses his opinion.

[Our Newspaper] The abolition of the Yarn Control Committee has been finalized. Various departments of the committee are also starting to wrap up their work. There is much speculation among outsiders as to whether a substitute organization will be established after the committee is abolished to meet actual economic needs. According to Mr. Dade, the American textile consultant to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, his opinion to visitors is as follows:

"The news of the Yarn Control Committee's abolition has been reported. However, I believe that if the Chinese government wants to handle national economic and technical issues, it must have an organization to manage the cotton textile industry. In other words, after the Yarn Control Committee is abolished, there must be a substitute organization. The mission of this substitute organization still occupies a very important position."

Regarding how the mission of the future substitute organization should be defined, Mr. Dade said: "In the current situation, the mission of this new organization should mainly include the following: (1) Using US aid cotton so that a large number of US cotton products still return to the government's control. (2) Using the power of government agencies to collect statistical data on cotton textiles for reference by the government and private yarn mills as a basis for improvement. (3) Promoting the increase and improvement of cotton production, purchasing domestic cotton at reasonable prices, and redistributing it to public and private yarn mills in exchange for cotton yarn and its products, which are then distributed to various regions to supply civilian needs. (4) Planning the improvement of China's textile industry and suggesting to the government to lift unnecessary controls, assisting public and private yarn mills to reach maximum production. (5) Meeting the legitimate needs of spinning mills, cotton merchants, and import and export merchants, and providing all effective guidance."

Mr. Dade then said: "The tasks listed above are quite complicated. First, technically, it must have the ability to handle all issues for the government. Secondly, it should also work with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to research, design, and implement the cotton textile industry. Only in this way can the existence of this organization have extremely important value in China's overall economy."

Finally, Mr. Dade expressed his opinion on whether the future substitute organization has confidence in achieving success: "The so-called substitute organization should be an organization that completely handles the government's cotton textile industry policies. It is also a bridge between the government and manufacturers. Therefore, its organization and substance should avoid the following four shortcomings: (1) The organization should not be too large to avoid heavy bureaucracy and reduce work efficiency. (2) The internal units should not be too many. In the current situation, it is essential to set up at most four departments. (3) It should grasp the essentials and avoid petty interventionism. (4) It should cooperate with private yarn mills and avoid measures that hinder the development of private yarn mills."

Mr. Dade concluded: "The textile industry is one of China's largest industries. The reconstruction of China's textile industry is of great importance to the economic lifeline of agriculture and industry. If the new organization follows the above principles, is based on government-private cooperation, and uses sound and reasonable management methods as a pivot to assist the government and adapt to commercial conditions, then I dare to conclude that the future of the new organization is extremely bright."

Rayon fails to arrive as scheduled. The China Trust Bureau decides to suspend allocation for one week.

The China Trust Bureau's allocation of rayon is suspended for one week because the stock has been exhausted and the rayon ordered from Italy is delayed due to shipping.

According to the person in charge of the bureau, the "Qu Lai Fu Shaer" ship carrying Italian rayon is expected to arrive in Shanghai in about ten days. As soon as it arrives, the allocation will be resumed.

Specially High Grade Rice Breaks the 50 Million Mark.

The rice market continues to rise. The money supply is becoming looser and looser, and the buying trend is becoming stronger and stronger. In addition, quotes from Wuxi are even higher, and people's minds are extremely firm. Prices are soaring. Specially high grade rice breaks the 50 million mark. Thin rice is also approaching the 50 million mark, an increase of 4 million. Other early thin rice and Indica rice have increased by 3-4 million. Coarse Indica and coarse Japonica are in high demand from factories, each increasing by 3 million. Yesterday, the total arrival of goods in the North and South markets was 47.17 million.

Flour: A sudden and rapid rise. The reported rise in rice prices has made people's minds extremely firm. Retail investors have a strong expectation of higher prices and are frequently involved. However, the owners of the goods are also holding on more strongly, and prices are high upon opening. Old car flour is 17.3 million yuan, a sharp increase of 2.4 million. "Warship" and "Red Bee" and other flours have increased by 2.1 million. Other flours, such as "Peacock" flour, have uniformly increased by 2.2-2.3 million. Large-package bran has sharply increased by 1.5 million.

Miscellaneous grains: An overall rise. Demand from local merchants remains strong, but because the arrival of goods is not high, the owners of the goods are trying their best to hold on. Soybeans finally increased by 3 million yuan. Broad beans and mung beans have fewer transactions, each increasing by 1-2 million. Corn and Yuan wheat are being purchased competitively by merchants from northern regions, increasing by 3 million yuan. Red sorghum transactions are light. Sesame seeds are being taken again by merchants from Tianjin, a sharp increase of 8 million yuan. Raw peanuts increased again by 10 million.

Edible oil: A fierce rise. The market is turbulent. Prices in the central market rose sharply, and then rapidly retreated at closing, finally showing a significant net increase. Amid a flurry of buying, soybean oil opened at 120 million by the factories, but it was all bought up in one go. The market showed a situation of demand exceeding supply, and the price was raised to 140 million. Near closing, retail investors sold off in large quantities at high prices, returning to 125 million yuan, a net increase of 20%. Rapeseed oil fluctuated greatly, a net increase of 20 million. Raw oil rose rapidly by 45 million, but later it could not be sold. Small-batch sesame oil rose sharply by 48 million, but fell at closing. Soybean cake generally increased by 1 million.

The tea market is firm.

Since British firms such as Yili, Concord, Huifu, and Jinlong resumed their interest in Qimen black tea, which had been quiet for a long time, the process has been frequently touted. Unfortunately, the stock of this tea is drying up, so it is not enough to allocate, and transactions are not booming. On the price side, amidst the loose money supply, the sharp rise in various commodities, and the export settlement certificates pushing the tide, there is a trend of daily increase. Other varieties are uniformly unwilling to show weakness, and are tracking forward. Looking at this situation, it seems difficult to curb the trend in the future.

Chinese wood yarn spools sell well in Southeast Asia.

Monthly export value reaches HK$2 million.

[Our Newspaper] The thread-making industry in our country has only about 20 years of history. In the past, foreign "Chain Brand" thread spools penetrated our country's rural areas, and the outflow of foreign exchange each year was difficult to calculate. In order to recover profit rights, domestic wood yarn spool factories have emerged. In the past decade, the industry's business has been booming. Production has gradually improved from handmade to machine-made, and output has increased day by day. In addition to being widely sold domestically, great efforts have also been made in export. According to Mr. Luo Liqun, a leader in the industry, overseas wood yarn markets, such as Singapore, Siam, Kuala Lumpur, Rangoon, Sanbinlong, Batavia, Makassar, Medan, Sumatra, India, Cairo, Mombasa, and other places, have widespread sales of "Flying Shuttle" brand wood yarn spools. Not only are they popular in cities, but they have also penetrated rural areas. Other brands of domestic goods are also seen on the market. 30,000 units are shipped out each month, with a value of HK$2 million. "Flying Shuttle" accounts for three-quarters of the market. The "Fortune Peach" foreign thread spools operated by the British are currently only distributed in the Cairo market, occupying a corner, and have been greatly impacted. Mr. Luo also emphasized that if domestic thread-making factories can continue to research and improve their products, not only can they combat Japan's southward expansion policy, but they will also have nothing to fear even if British and American products compete with us. According to reports, the China Flying Shuttle Thread Factory was reorganized into a limited liability company in 1947 and is currently one of the largest thread-making factories in our country.

Chinese Medicines Increase Across the Board.

The Chinese medicine market is affected by soaring transportation costs and the influence on costs. In addition, floating capital is flowing south, and the Hong Kong exchange rate is gradually shrinking. Various goods from Hong Kong are soaring beyond their usual levels.

Huanglian (Coptis chinensis) takes the lead, soaring to a new high price of 120 million yuan per liang. Ginseng and Sanqi (Panax notoginseng) follow closely, creating a record of 140 million yuan for 200 branches. New and old Magnolia officinalis maintain their basic prices. Cinnamon soars directly, breaking the 10 million yuan mark. The price of Croton tiglium rises by 1.6 million yuan. West Zhun variety Achyranthes bidentata is in high demand, with all Achyranthes sharply rising by 4 million yuan, and the Mao Chang variety rising by 3 million yuan. Compared with last week, there has been a net increase of 100%, and there is still hope for higher prices in the future. Angelica sinensis has ample stock in various grades, and actual sales are light, so the market remains stagnant and lacks the strength to rise.

Foreign Pine Prices are Shouted Higher.

Yesterday's timber market saw shouted higher prices for foreign pine due to the rising exchange settlement certificate. However, the outlet for sales was limited, so it lacked the strength to rise. Fir continued to hover around 240,000.

Guangzhou Branch of National Bank Purchases Exchange Settlement Certificates.

[Our Newspaper] The Business Bureau of the Central Bank recently sent Circular No. 151 to various designated banks, stating: The Guangzhou branch of the bank may, from August 2, purchase exchange settlement certificates issued by Shanghai as needed. The previous regulation that the proceeds from the sale of exchange settlement certificates in Shanghai would be given free preferential treatment when remitting south to Guangzhou has been cancelled. If the Guangzhou branch of a designated bank still intends to sell the exchange settlement certificate in Shanghai, the free preferential treatment of Circular No. 141 will no longer apply.

Market trading is slack, and Chinese stocks have turned from firm to weak.

Chinese stocks yesterday saw limited trading due to the weekend, with both buyers and sellers adopting a cautious approach as the announcement and implementation of new policies were imminent. As a result, the money supply was extremely loose, and physical goods continued to rise. However, the Central Bank sold off large amounts of exchange settlement certificates, causing the stock market to turn from firm to weak.

Upon opening in the morning, rumors of peace talks resurfaced. Yongsha opened at 13,850 yuan, and other stocks also opened lower.

Various types of oils generally increase by about 70%. The Transportation Control Committee explains the reasons for the adjustment.

[Our Newspaper] The prices of various types of oils were adjusted starting yesterday, averaging about 70%.

According to the spokesperson of the Transportation Control Committee, "Recently, various oil companies have repeatedly applied for price increases. The Transportation Control Committee and relevant agencies have reviewed their actual costs and approved them.

"Currently, the supply of oils almost entirely relies on foreign imports. Therefore, any change in the foreign exchange rate and the price of exchange settlement certificates will inevitably cause oil prices to move accordingly. In recent days, the selling price of exchange settlement certificates has risen sharply, and the exchange settlement cost of imported oils has increased daily, which is the main reason for the rise in oil prices.

"In addition, the shipping costs of ships have increased by 120% since August 5. The increase in freight costs means that the cost of oil prices in other ports will increase if freight is included. In addition, due to the increase in the cost of living for workers, labor costs have also become more expensive. All of these are reasons for the rise in oil prices."

Another report: The Shanghai District Fuel Control Committee has found that coal transportation on Beining Road and Jinpu Road is often blocked. Recently, the coal supply has been insufficient, and scheduling has also been difficult. The source of coal has been greatly affected, and the stock of coal is decreasing day by day. It is inevitable to use safety coal, and the situation is more serious than last year. Therefore, at 4 pm on July 7, it convened various coal-using agencies and companies at the Zhaoshang Bureau Building to discuss coal supply issues. Representatives from more than 40 units, including the Public Utilities Bureau and the Shanghai Electric Power Company, attended.

First, Zhang Xiwei, the chairman of the Fuel Control Committee, reported on the coal source situation in the past three months of May, June, and July, and hoped that various coal-using agencies and companies would save coal and solve the source problem. The attending representatives unanimously believed that the coal shortage was serious. Mr. Ferguson, the representative of the Electric Power Company, immediately stated that the company was willing to reduce coal consumption and cooperate to solve the difficulties. Finally, Chairman Zhang gave a reply, stating that he was willing to do his best to dredge the coal source, and would not take reduction measures unless absolutely necessary. The meeting adjourned at 6 pm.

Lou Wen'ao's stamina insufficient. Marathon attempt ends in failure. He was in second place at the halfway point. The champion is Argentina's Cabrera.

[Our Newspaper] London, August 8, broadcast: Our country's deaf-mute athlete Lou Wen'ao was consistently in the top three for the first 26 kilometers of the marathon. Unfortunately, due to physical stamina, he was unable to compete with European and American athletes, who had inherent advantages. Lou Wen'ao was not among the top 12 finishers of the entire race. The champion was Argentina's Cabrera, and Great Britain's Richards snatched second place with a final sprint.

At 13.3 kilometers, crossing the Dean River Bridge and starting to climb Mill Hill, Belgium's Gailay was far in the lead. Half a minute after Gailay crossed the bridge, Lou Wen'ao and the closely following Jimenez (Argentina) and Yessa (France) arrived. St. Senini (Argentina), who was in fifth place, began to catch up. Chile's Arlanobia trailed behind. The audience applauded as they crossed the bridge, and the Chilean youth's shaky posture seemed to have won the audience's sympathy. When the main group entered the mountain path, Jimenez, who had not been mentioned in the predictions, suddenly broke away and sprinted ahead. At the 20-kilometer mark, passing the War Memorial Tower, Belgium's Gailay was still in the lead, just one hour and five minutes and 29 seconds after the start of the race. A few hundred meters behind Gailay was Lou Wen'ao (20-kilometer time: one hour, nine minutes, and 53.3 seconds), followed closely by Argentina's Jimenez. At one hour, ten minutes, and 36 seconds, France's Yessa and Sweden's Osling ran past the 20-kilometer milestone. Fifteen seconds later, Argentina's Cabrola began to run past. At 23 kilometers, crossing the Redland Railway Bridge and turning north for the return journey, Gayne's speed had decreased. South America's Jimenez had overtaken Lou Wen'ao and was closing in on Gayne. Cabrera was in fourth place, not far behind Lou Wen'ao. St. Senini, who was originally in fifth place, had been overtaken and was struggling to stay in fifth place.

Situation Changes

At the 30-kilometer mark, the situation had changed. Lou Wen'ao, the deaf-mute Chinese athlete who had been in the top three for the first 20 kilometers, ran out of energy and gradually fell behind. The times for the top six finishers at 30 kilometers were: (1) Gailay, one hour, 47 minutes, and one second; (2) Jimenez, one hour, 47 minutes, and 33 seconds; (3) Zhuo (Korea), one hour, 47 minutes, and 53 seconds; (4) Cabrura, one hour, 47 minutes, and 54 seconds; (5) Osling, one hour, 48 minutes, and 25 seconds; (6) Ruite (South Africa), one hour, 48 minutes, and 30 seconds.

After that, turning west into Waiting Street and then heading north through Canaan Park, Cabrura gradually revealed his prowess. After Kingsbury Street, he took the lead and sprinted all the way into Wembley Stadium, winning the championship in two hours, 34 minutes, and 51.6 seconds, and Argentina won their first gold medal. The complete results of the top 12 finishers are as follows:

(1) Cabrera (Argentina), two hours, 34 minutes, and 51.6 seconds.

(4) Coleman (South Africa), two hours, 36 minutes, and seconds.
(5) Jimenez (Argentina), (6) Ruite (South Africa), (7) Osling (Sweden), (8) Sista (Norway), (9) St. Senini (Argentina), (10) Larson (Denmark), (11) Hino (Finland), (12) Gurikara (Finland).

World Games Basketball Second Group

Our Country Ranks Fourth Place

The All-China News Agency reports fifth place.

[Our Newspaper] In the World Games basketball competition, because South Korea defeated Chile, the five countries of China, the Philippines, South Korea, and Belgium each had three wins and two losses. According to the scoring average method, the Central News Agency's London dispatch said that our country ranked fourth in the second group. Although it lost the final round of eight, it could still compete for 9th to 16th place. However, according to the Associated Press dispatch, the organizing committee announced that our country ranked fifth. It is unknown what calculation method was used, and the dispatch did not provide details. According to the London Broadcasting Corporation last night, our country will participate in the competition for 9th to 16th place, indicating that our country should be ranked fourth, above the Philippines. The exact situation awaits further clarification.

[Central News Agency, London, July 7] The World Games basketball second group competition has been finalized. Our country ranked fourth and failed to enter the championship.

### Utilizing U.S. Aid to Complement Self-Help: Executive Yuan Orders Preparation of Concrete Plans for U.S. Reference by End of August

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 7th] The Executive Yuan is currently making multifaceted efforts to actively implement plans to utilize U.S. aid to complement self-help initiatives. Regarding the specific methods for its implementation, Premier of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee, Weng Wenhao, has ordered the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee and relevant agencies to quickly draft them and submit reports and data on the progress of past self-help initiatives. This is to strengthen implementation and achieve the goal of using U.S. aid to complete self-help plans. After receiving the order, the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee specially convened a joint meeting of representatives from relevant agencies at 11:00 AM on the 7th to discuss various issues related to utilizing U.S. aid to complement self-help initiatives. After two hours of exchanging opinions and discussions, it was decided that all relevant agencies should submit a report detailing the implementation of utilizing U.S. aid to complement self-help initiatives to the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee by the end of August. At the same time, they should also submit specific implementation methods and upcoming measures for utilizing U.S. aid to complement self-help initiatives by the end of August. The U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration is paying close attention to this concrete plan and the progress of past implementations, and has inquired with our government. After the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee compiles it, it will be provided to them for reference through diplomatic channels. Those present at the joint meeting between the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee and relevant agencies on the morning of the 7th included Dong Lin, Director of the American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Xie Gengmin, Director of the National Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance, Liu Xingji, Director of the Control Department of the Ministry of Food, Jin Shishi, Counselor of the Ministry of Transportation, He Huaide, Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Xu Kai, Technical Supervisor of the Ministry of Water Resources, Shi Zhengxin, Director of the Health Department of the Ministry of Health, and Yang Shaoyun, Specialist Commissioner of the Resources Committee, among others. Yan Jiagan presided over the meeting, but due to important official business, he left midway and was replaced by Wu Xuelan, Deputy Secretary-General of the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee. During the meeting, there was a consensus on the importance of utilizing U.S. aid to complement self-help initiatives. When discussing the negotiation process of the bilateral agreement, Dong Lin, Director of the American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, emphasized that U.S. aid can help us implement self-help plans. If we can do well, then in addition to this U.S. aid, U.S. aid can continue to flow in after April next year. However, if U.S. aid is not utilized properly, according to the U.S. Aid to China Plan and the provisions of the bilateral agreement, this U.S. aid may still be terminated midway. Dong hoped that all agencies could provide as much new information as possible on utilizing U.S. aid to complement self-help initiatives, so as to provide it to the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration and allow them to understand. The meeting participants all believed that since former Premier Zhang announced the ten self-help plans, the second item, "improving national and local taxes to benefit the national treasury," has recently been put into practice. Premier Weng, not long after forming his cabinet, resolutely decided to reform the tax system, merging the commodity tax and direct tax, which demonstrates his determination to implement self-help plans and reform public finance. Moreover, the recent adjustments to various tax regulations are also a manifestation of the implementation of the second self-help plan. The tenth self-help plan, "restoring transportation and important industries and mines to the greatest extent possible," has not been fully implemented due to the communist rebellion, but the greatest efforts have been made under difficult circumstances. Recently, the entire Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been opened to traffic, and improvements to the Guangdong-Hankou Railway are underway, all of which can serve as clear evidence of the implementation of self-help plans. Many other items have also been partially implemented. Finally, it was decided that all agencies should submit information on the implementation of self-help plans to the U.S. Aid Utilization Committee by the end of the month, and propose concrete implementation methods for utilizing U.S. aid to complement self-help initiatives.

### Political Upheaval Within Tibet: Reting's Followers Raise Banner in Opposition to Current Regent's Policies, Growing in Strength; Rong is Said to Intend to Resign and Apologize

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 7th] It is reliably learned: Relevant parties received a telegram from Tibet on the 7th stating that the followers of Reting, whose Sera Monastery was destroyed by cannon fire by the current Regent Rongzeng last April, have united with Drepung to raise a banner in opposition to Rongzeng, as they are unwilling to endure long-term oppression. The momentum is great, and Rongzeng is unable to cope and intends to resign and apologize. It is noted that Tibet's three world-renowned monasteries are Drepung Monastery, Ganden Monastery, and Sera Monastery, all located near Lhasa. Changes within the three major monasteries have always had a significant impact on Tibetan politics. Drepung and others have 7,000 monks, and their power is the most powerful. The "iron staff," or disciplinary officer, in the monastery can extend its authority to officials and soldiers in the three major monasteries and the entire city of Lhasa. This was approved by the Fifth Dalai Lama. In addition, the "Ongze" who leads the chanting of scriptures in the monastery is also the leader of the "Ongzes" of the three major monasteries.
