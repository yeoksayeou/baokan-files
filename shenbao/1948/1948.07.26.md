[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] Kuomintang President Chiang recently hosted Kuomintang legislative and supervisory members at the auditorium of the Ministry of National Defense at 5:30 PM on the 25th, as the first meeting of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan was coming to a close and the members would soon be returning to their hometowns. Approximately 400 people attended, including legislative and supervisory members and heads of central ministries. In his address, the President first expressed his satisfaction with the achievements of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan meetings. He stated: "During the meetings, there were often expressions of disagreement, but now, by and large, we can proceed according to the party's decisions, and the results are quite good." Secondly, the President separately described his conviction and certainty of victory regarding the current military and economic situation, and hoped that everyone could dispel their fears and strengthen their will. Regarding the economic aspect, he also stated: "During the National Assembly, I declared that our economic foundation has not been shaken by the suppression of the rebellion and the destruction of the communists. As evidenced today, it remains as it was in the past, and the economy has not been shaken." The President concluded by saying: "If you have any opinions on party affairs, I hope you will provide them to serve as a reference for reform." After the President's speech, legislative members Wu Wangji, Yin Shuxian, Yang Buping, and supervisory member Zhang Dinghua stood up to speak, expressing their opinions. They mostly advocated that the reform of party affairs was a necessary fact, and that certain political corruption and unclear rewards and punishments should be reviewed. The President immediately stood up and said: "You are all outstanding members of the party, and I hope you will provide more opinions on party affairs, and that party members can jointly take responsibility to improve party affairs." The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] President Chiang hosted a tea party for Kuomintang legislative and supervisory members at the auditorium of the Ministry of National Defense at 5:30 PM on the 25th. President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke, President of the Supervisory Yuan Yu Youren, Vice President of the Legislative Yuan Jia Jingde, and over 400 legislative and supervisory members attended. During the meeting, the President stood up and addressed the attendees, expressing his satisfaction with the work of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan over the past two months. He hoped that they could further unite their will and concentrate their efforts to benefit the suppression of the rebellion. The President then explained that "the current economic and military situation is fundamentally unchanged compared to three months ago. Prices have obviously risen, but the legal tender fund has not decreased. The army has occasionally suffered setbacks, but new forces are growing. The reason for the current unrest and social turmoil is that some people do not understand the truth and are influenced by communist propaganda, resulting in a loss of confidence. I believe that revolutionary party members must first self-reflect and have self-confidence whenever the revolutionary situation is critical, reflecting on whether all their actions are in line with the doctrine. If they are in line with the doctrine, then they can be confident that they have great power to overcome all difficulties. Since leading the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance against Japan, our party has consistently used national spirit and public justice as important conditions for defeating the enemy. Now, the communists betray the nation, sell out the country, and isolate themselves from the people. Even if they are rampant for a while, they will eventually be eliminated by public justice." The President's words moved the entire audience, who applauded in unison. The tea party ended at 7:00 PM.

[Another Dispatch] President Chiang invited legislative and supervisory committee party members to a tea party at the auditorium of the Ministry of National Defense at 5:30 PM on the 25th, and also invited heads of departments and ministries of the Central Party Headquarters to attend.

Subsequently, legislative and supervisory committee members Wu Wangji, Yin Shuxian, Zhang Dinghua, Li Wenzhai, Yang Buping, and others spoke successively, stating their opinions on party affairs and politics.

To Welcome Zhang's Appointment as President of the Examination Yuan

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Examination Yuan President Zhang Boling will fly to Tianjin on the morning of the 28th to handle Nankai school affairs and will return to Nanjing after staying for about a month. During Zhang's absence from Nanjing, the duties of the president will be performed by Vice President Jia Jingde.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 25th] Zhang Boling, President of Tianjin Nankai University, came to Nanjing this time to take office as the President of the Examination Yuan. More than 200 alumni of the school in Nanjing held a grand welcome tea party at No. 16 Huaqiao Road at 4:00 PM on the 25th. At the meeting, the alumni introduced themselves in turn, reporting on their lives and experiences after leaving the school. The oldest was a student from the Xuantong period, and the youngest was a graduate of Nankai Middle School this summer. Everyone spoke eloquently, revisiting the 50-year history of Nankai, which was full of interest. Then, Tu Ming represented the alumni association to deliver a welcome speech, hoping that everyone would carry forward the spirit of the school motto "Public Service and Ability," work hard to serve, and strengthen their studies and conduct, and strengthen their connections. Zhang spoke in a very pleasant mood, saying: "I have been engaged in education for exactly 50 years. I am very comforted to see that the alumni can uphold the school motto to be self-reliant and serve the society with outstanding achievements. If I can make some contributions to the country in my life, it is also the crystallization of the achievements of all the alumni, and I am even more inspired. I have always been committed to education and have never been an official. This time, I was invited by the President and approved by the Supervisory Yuan to become the President of the Examination Yuan. The responsibility is heavy, and I am afraid that I will not be able to do it well. However, I think that the country and the head of state need me, so I dare not resign again, and finally reluctantly take on the heavy task. Fortunately, I have the assistance of the two ministers, Shen (Honglie) and Tian (Jiongjin), and Secretary-General Lei (Fazhang). I hope to follow President Dai's grand vision to further advance the establishment of China's traditional examination system." Then, he invited alumnus Lei Fazhang to speak, who elaborated on Zhang's philosophy of life and work and his spirit of hard work. He also said: "President Zhang advocates 'practical' ism in education and 'down-to-earth' in doing things. This time, he is in charge of the Examination Yuan, and he is very willing to contribute to China's examination and personnel system in the future. Although the president is over seventy years old, he is still in good spirits and still handles all affairs with the spirit of 'not perfunctory' and 'emphasis on research'. I believe that the president will be able to assist the president in promoting constitutional government." Zou Xingyou then reported on the recent situation of the Tianjin Alumni Association and the work of the Public Service and Ability Society in great detail. Finally, 19 Nanjing alumni association executives, including Wang Naikuan, were elected and scheduled to hold their first meeting at 8:00 PM on the 27th.

### If Forced to Concede in Berlin, the Soviet Union Will Expand Ideological Struggle in Asia

Views of Washington Officials

[United Press, Washington, 24th] American officials here believe that if the Soviet Union is forced to concede in Berlin, it will expand its ideological struggle in Asia.

China and Southeast Asia are most likely to be targeted by Communist efforts. As for Japan, due to the close control of the United States, the Communists will likely be powerless.

So far, there is no evidence that the Soviet Union has increased its support to the Chinese Communists. However, judging from the recent statement by the Chinese Communists echoing the Communist International Information Bureau’s condemnation of the Yugoslav Communists, the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party is almost entirely aligned with Moscow.

Editorial

### A Discussion on Establishing an Economic Control Bureau

The rumors of establishing an Economic Control Bureau have been rampant in recent days. There is much speculation about who will be in charge and when it will be implemented. We do not want to discuss this prematurely, but one thing is apparent: at least to some extent, the central government does have this plan.

On the one hand, the Legislative Yuan is passing a resolution to abolish the National Economic Commission, while on the other hand, the Executive Yuan is planning to establish another Economic Control Bureau of considerable size. This not only seems difficult to justify in theory, but also gives the general public the impression that the executive branch is deliberately causing trouble with the legislative branch. According to recent news reports, the most compelling reason for establishing the Economic Control Bureau seems to be to strengthen power and unify authority. However, the National Economic Commission already had the Premier of the Executive Yuan as its chairman, and the heads of relevant ministries as standing committee members or committee members. Judging by its position and authority, it surpassed the proposed new institution. Why is it necessary to change the appearance before power can be strengthened and authority can be unified? Moreover, strengthening and unification are secondary. The true administrative efficiency remains a mystery until proven by facts. Therefore, these reasons are naturally insufficient to justify the establishment of a new institution.

We believe that the failure of all previous controls should not be attributed to the weakness of organization and personnel, but rather to the lack of clear and rational policies. Policy is the backbone, while organization and personnel are merely conditions for execution. Lack of conditions can indeed affect the intended goals, but if the plan is too flawed, too fragmented, or too detached from reality, or if preferences are contrary to human nature, and if the state’s financial, monetary, and economic policies are chaotic, contradictory, and run counter to economic stability, then it is doubtful whether adjusting the organization and personnel can reverse the declining situation and turn things around.

If the policies have been reformed, and the plans, steps, and goals of future control are indeed different from the past, and can truly be renewed and restart with the people, then there are still many procedures that must be prepared in advance:

First, the legislative procedure. Now that we have entered the constitutional era, the establishment of a formal state institution, its staffing and budget, must be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval. In particular, a powerful regulatory agency, when exercising its powers, affects the rights and obligations of the people in all aspects. If the temporary provisions of the Constitution, which were added due to the needs of suppressing the rebellion, are used as an excuse to take advantage of the Legislative Yuan’s recess and establish a new institution by means of an administrative order that contradicts the original intention of the Legislative Yuan to abolish the National Economic Commission, there may be many problems, and it may not be able to start its work smoothly.

Second, the control regulations are the basis for its implementation of control. There are many such regulations now, so there is no worry about not being able to cite them. However, precisely because there are too many, there are already overlaps, contradictions, and disproportionate provisions. We have long advocated thoroughly reorganizing them in order to promote them smoothly, but the government has always turned a deaf ear. To give an example, these regulations all have explicit provisions on who is in charge and who is assisting, and there are also provisions on inspection, reporting, review, and how to deal with them, and by whom. If these are not differentiated and rectified in advance, and the authority is not clearly divided, how will the newly established agency start its work? Will the original competent authorities willingly hand over the power of management, or will they allow them to go their own way, and can they operate in parallel without conflict? Will this approach be consistent with the purpose of unifying authority and enhancing efficiency? These all need to be considered in advance.

The most ideal solution, of course, is to thoroughly reorganize these laws and responsibilities, and revise all conflicting, contradictory, and unrealistic aspects, so as to avoid the ills of duplication and shirking responsibility. But this involves legislative issues, and it may not be easy to resolve satisfactorily in the short term!

Third, the scope of control. It is widely rumored that the powers of this newly established institution are limited to design and decision-making, which is somewhat similar to the National Economic Commission, and it does not bear the responsibility of execution itself; but some say that the scope is very large, including the original tasks of the Four Joint Offices, the sale of materials, and the yarn control committee, and the fuel control committee. This is another question, and we do not want to lightly express our approval or disapproval here. However, control is comprehensive and must be implemented across the board. This is a principle that must be followed. If only one place is controlled, while other places are not, or even if only Shanghai is controlled and others are not, then there will be no good results. We pointed out the other day that the inspection of warehouses in this city is very strict, and many grains have fled to Wuxi, which can be used as proof. Also, it is absolutely impossible to do a good job by controlling only one section and neglecting other parts. For example, the Yarn Control Committee only controlled the unified collection and purchase of cotton, but did not pay attention to the contract spinning and weaving of yarn and cloth, and even failed to fully supply raw materials. The main reason for its failure lies in these areas. Therefore, the location of the new institution, whether in Shanghai or in Beijing, and whether it controls certain matters first or controls all regulatory affairs, must be fully controlled, and not just focus on Shanghai, and especially not just control one section of a matter. The effects of such a paralyzed institution can be seen from the past.

Fourth, the means of control. To make politics effective and thoroughly implemented, it is ultimately necessary to rely on administrative power—the police. This is unavoidable; economic control, especially complicated, is naturally no exception. However, compulsory enforcement is, after all, the last resort, and when the spirit of abiding by the law is too weak and the corruption of bending the law for personal gain is too prevalent, compulsory means may sometimes be exhausted. For example, during the rebellion suppression period, strikes and slowdowns were repeatedly prohibited, but what was the actual situation? Can compulsory enforcement be implemented everywhere, and penalties be imposed in each case? Therefore, we have always believed that economic problems should be solved through economic means, and only through economic means can they be solved. Now, let’s take the example of prices again. From Chongqing to Nanjing, from the Anti-Japanese War to the rebellion suppression period, if we insist that the competent and assisting agencies in various places were all acting against the orders of the central government and unwilling to earnestly suppress prices, it would be unfair. However, if the economic root causes are not removed, such as continued inflation, daily decreasing production, and consistently unimpeded transportation, then even if officials, police, and soldiers in various places really made great efforts and mobilized together, how much use would it be?

During the rebellion suppression period, the economy was abnormal, and it was necessary to implement controls appropriately in order to increase production and rationalize supply. This is a view shared by all. However, the effectiveness of control still depends on whether production can be increased and supply can be rationalized. In other words, the past and present control policies are indeed worthy of review and improvement. If this key point is ignored, and the organization and personnel are simply shuffled back and forth, hoping to find a way out, it is like not finding the source of the disease and just hiring doctors indiscriminately to cure this serious illness, which is still a kind of extravagance. Don't you see the cotton yarn and cloth control agency? Without going back to the Anti-Japanese War, it has been changed three times since the victory, and the result is still a resolution to abolish it. This shows that the focus of the problem should be there and not here.

Another good story is that Wang Yizhai, chairman of the Nanjing Chamber of Commerce, voted for himself in the ballot box, and Wang has also decided to voluntarily donate 5 billion yuan.

### Complex Reasons for Expulsion of Overseas Chinese in Malaya

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 25th] After the end of the war, 190 overseas Chinese were expelled from Singapore, and 104 were expelled from the Federation of Malaya, for a total of 294 people. According to a person in charge of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the reasons for the expulsion of these overseas Chinese are complex and the nature is not simple. Some landed illegally without following legal procedures, some impersonated wartime returnees, and forged documents were eventually discovered. Some are members of criminal gangs engaged in illegal activities locally. In all these cases, diplomatic authorities are not convenient to make representations to the local government. Therefore, very few cases of these 294 people were reported by local consulates. However, if legitimate overseas Chinese are illegally expelled or oppressed by the local government, the Commission will immediately consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to investigate and make representations to protect them.

During the March 29th Uprising in Guangzhou in the year of Xin Hai, Liu served as a pioneer, which is what the world calls the Battle of Huanghuagang. In August of the same year, the Wuchang Uprising took place, and Liu followed Huang Keqiang to supervise the battle in Hankou.

### Siam Persecutes Overseas Chinese Education; "Underground Schools" and "Guerrilla Teachers" Emerge in Response

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 24th] Two wartime terms (both byproducts of the recent Siamese persecution of overseas Chinese schools) are now widely mentioned in local newspapers. In the conversation of overseas Chinese, these two terms, namely "underground schools" and "guerrilla teachers," are adopted. Hundreds of overseas Chinese teachers who were disqualified by the Siamese Ministry of Education during the identification examination are now adopting guerrilla tactics to solve their own livelihoods. They are hired by many overseas Chinese families who hope their children will receive Chinese education as private tutors. Overseas Chinese families make various arrangements so that their children can concentrate in various "underground classrooms" to listen to Chinese courses. However, according to Siamese law, any teacher who teaches more than seven children in one place is considered illegal. At the same time, the Siamese Ministry of Education is taking strong measures to prevent the growth of such underground schools. Informed sources say that in the ongoing negotiations between our embassy and the Siamese government on the issue of overseas Chinese schools, several points have been agreed upon. Siam often takes an inch and wants a mile in the current school dispute talks, so our embassy and the Siamese government will meet at least once more before the school dispute is concluded. Under the current circumstances, the teaching of our national language is only allowed in the first four grades of primary school, and the number of hours per week is very limited. Overseas Chinese students above the fourth grade are forced to rely on private tutors to learn more Chinese.

### The Large-Scale Fighting in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, Ceases; Both Sides Obey the Pacification Commissioner's Advice to Stop Fighting; The Authorities Consult on Thoroughly Suppressing the Treacherous Bandits Who Assisted the Fighting

渝沙磁區學運負責者　周國良凌春波均被捕
Zhou Guoliang and Ling Chunbo, Those Responsible for Student Movements in the Shapingba District of Chongqing, Have Been Arrested

承認參加共匪組織鼓動風潮
Admitted to Participating in Communist Bandit Organizations and Inciting Disturbances

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] On the evening of the 23rd, the Chongqing Garrison Headquarters arrested Zhou Guoliang and Ling Chunbo, two underground members of the Communist bandits. After interrogation, it was revealed that they were students of Chongqing University. In order to handle this matter carefully, the Garrison Headquarters sent a special letter to Zhang Hongyuan, President of Chongqing University, explaining the reasons for the arrest of Zhou and Ling. The Garrison Headquarters issued the following detailed information about the case: The Headquarters previously arrested Liu Guozhi, the head of the student movement in the Junqing District of the Communist bandits. According to Liu's confession, Ling Chunbo, Zhou Guoliang, and others were responsible for the student movements in the Shapingba District. Based on this clue, the Headquarters discovered Ling and Zhou engaging in illegal activities in Xiaolongkan on the evening of the 23rd and arrested them. Many reactionary documents were found on their persons. After interrogation, Zhou Guoliang confessed: "I am a third-year student in the Industrial Management Department of Chongqing University. In the second semester of last year, I was introduced by Ling Chunbo to join the Communist bandit organization and was directly commanded by Liu Guozhi, the leader of the student movement in the Chongqing District. I participated in the anti-civil war and anti-hunger movements, as well as the recent leak of examination questions for new students at the six national universities, taking the opportunity to incite disturbances, etc." Ling Chunbo confessed: "I am a graduate of the Mathematics and Physics Department of Chongqing University. In the first half of 1946, I joined the Democratic Youth League. Before June of last year, Liu Guozhi was assigned by the higher authorities to contact me and instruct me to participate in the anti-civil war and anti-hunger movements, etc. After that, I was summoned by the Garrison Headquarters and released after repenting. In the second semester of 1947, I returned to Chongqing University. Liu Guozhi contacted me again and invited me to join the Communist Party organization. I formally joined the Communist Party organization half a month later. A month ago, after hearing that Liu Guozhi had been arrested, I planned to leave Chongqing, but the higher authorities did not allow it and ordered me to work on the student movement in the Shapingba District. This time, I came from Jian Shan Middle School in Beibei to Shapingba, wanting to serve as a teaching assistant at Chongqing University in order to cover up my underground work. Just as the issue of leaking examination questions arose, I discussed it with Zhou Guoliang and others to take the opportunity to launch a large-scale strike."

鑛產稅稽征規則　工商財政兩部制定公布
Ministry of Industry and Commerce and Ministry of Finance jointly formulate and promulgate "Rules for the Assessment and Collection of Mineral Product Tax"

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 25th] The Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Finance have recently formulated and promulgated the "Rules for the Assessment and Collection of Mineral Product Tax." The full text is as follows:

Rules for the Assessment and Collection of Mineral Product Tax

Article 1: These rules are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 14 of the Mineral Product Tax Regulations.

Article 2: The assessment, collection, registration, and inspection of mineral product tax shall be handled in accordance with these rules, unless otherwise provided by laws and regulations.

Article 3: Mineral product tax shall be calculated and paid by miners or merchants engaged in smelting, selling, and transporting mineral products (hereinafter referred to as "merchants") in accordance with the announced unit tax rates.

Article 4: When merchants produce mineral products, they shall fill in the prescribed forms with the quantity of production, sales, transportation, storage, and inventory on a daily basis, and report them to the local competent commodity tax authorities or the resident tax officers at mines, factories, or sites for registration on a ten-day basis.

Merchants filling in the aforementioned forms shall be responsible for the accuracy of the information. The commodity tax authorities or the resident tax officers at mines, factories, or sites may check the inventory and audit the books when necessary, and the merchants shall not refuse.

Article 5: With the exception of small mines with small production quantities that are only sold locally, which shall be inspected and verified by the commodity tax authorities to determine the average production volume and ordered to pay on a monthly basis, the mineral product tax for iron ore shall be levied at the time of smelting, and the mineral product tax for other mineral products shall be levied at the time of transportation. The collection procedures are as follows:

(1) For those collected by commodity tax authorities stationed at mines, factories, or sites, or by merchants who apply to the local commodity tax authorities for collection, the merchants shall first fill in a tax payment application when the iron products are smelted or other mineral products are shipped, and report it to the local commodity tax authorities or the resident tax officers at mines, factories, or sites for verification and issuance of a payment voucher. The merchants shall then pay the tax themselves in accordance with the Public Treasury Law and submit the receipt to the original issuing authority for verification and issuance of a tax certificate. If the tax certificate is required to be affixed with an official seal in accordance with the regulations of the Tax Affairs Administration, the seal shall be affixed to the packaging and stamped with the date of the issuing authority before transportation is permitted.

(2) For those who pay tax on a monthly basis based on the assessed average production volume, the merchants shall calculate the amount of tax payable based on the average production volume verified by the commodity tax authorities and the tax rate at that time, and fill in a tax payment application at the end of each month, report it to the local commodity tax authorities for verification and issuance of a payment voucher, and pay the tax themselves.

美國外交軍政要員　集柏林舉行會商
American Diplomatic, Military, and Political Officials Gather in Berlin for Consultations

將轉赴英參加重要會議
Will Proceed to England to Attend Important Meetings

[News Report] San Francisco, 25th (Broadcast): American Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, arrived in Berlin today from Moscow. The concentration of American diplomatic and military personnel in Berlin is seen by all sides as a prelude to the resumption of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference. Some even believe that Truman and Stalin may hold direct meetings to resolve the Berlin issue.

[United Press, Berlin, 25th] As thousands of Berlin residents lined up today in the Soviet sector of the city to exchange Soviet currency for the second time in a month amidst the Soviet currency reform, senior American diplomatic experts are gathering here. Lieutenant General Clay, Commander of American Forces in Germany, along with his political advisor, Xue Fei, and State Department Soviet affairs expert, Bohlen, arrived here from Washington on the morning of the 25th.

[United Press, Berlin, 25th] American Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, arrived in Berlin on a Soviet transport plane on the afternoon of the 25th. Upon arrival, Smith went directly to Lieutenant General Clay's residence. At the same time, American Ambassador to England, Douglas, is scheduled to arrive here from London at 5:00 PM. Ambassadors Smith and Douglas will hold a meeting with Lieutenant General Clay and State Department Soviet affairs expert, Bohlen. Clay's political advisor, Xue Fei, and Littell Berger will also attend. Douglas, Smith, and Bohlen will return to London together tonight.

[United Press, London, 24th] As a group of American experts on Germany and the Soviet Union gather in Europe, American Ambassador to England, Douglas, is exerting all his efforts to promote a second note from the Western Three Powers to the Soviet Union. At the same time, American officials will also hold important meetings here and in Berlin to discuss future steps to deal with the Berlin crisis. State Department Counselor Warren, carrying Secretary of State Marshall's master plan, arrived in Europe from Washington. It is said that Douglas personally invited Bohlen to come here to assist in consultations with Britain and France. The three-nation talks have been going on for several weeks. At the same time, American Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, left Moscow for Berlin on the 25th to participate in the Berlin situation conference. It is expected that the aforementioned senior American officials will meet in the near future, as time is of the essence. The second note to the Soviet Union from Britain, the United States, and France is like an arrow on the string and must be released. All indications here this week indicate that Western countries will support the Four-Power Conference and are not in a hurry to confront the Soviet Union. The main issue is the form of the second note to the Soviet Union, and further delays are due to the instability of the French political situation. The arrival of Bohlen and Smith in Western Europe will accelerate the final action.

Schuman to Succeed Bidault as Foreign Minister

[News Report] Paris, 24th (Broadcast): Marie spent most of this morning meeting with representatives of the Popular Republican Party and the Socialist Party. After the meeting, Marie presented a report to President Auriol. At the same time, the Popular Republican and Socialist parties also discussed whether to accept or reject Marie's platform. The new government formed by Marie will include a large number of veterans such as Léon Blum and Ramadier.

[United Press, Paris, 25th] French Prime Minister Marie continued to meet with leaders of various political parties on the morning of the 25th to finalize his broad, centrist, and right-leaning coalition cabinet. Marie had little rest after the parliament surprisingly passed his appointment as prime minister on the evening of the 24th by a vote of 352 to 190, with 53 abstentions. Marie had dinner with former Prime Ministers Blum and Reynaud on the evening of the 24th, and it is generally expected that these two will hold important positions in the new government.

Marie first met with his party colleagues, Cuailli, on the morning of the 25th, followed by representatives of the Socialist Party led by Mollet. They will follow the Popular Republican Party and other small parties and be included in the new cabinet.

Also, Prime Minister Marie will present a list of new cabinet members at a meeting on the 27th. Marie may announce the cabinet choices on the evening of the 25th, but it is generally believed that due to differences among the political parties, the cabinet choices will be announced on the 26th at the earliest. Political observers expect former Prime Minister Schuman to succeed Bidault as Foreign Minister, former Prime Minister Reynaud to be Finance Minister, former Prime Minister Blum to be Minister of State, and former Finance Minister Mayer to be Defense Minister.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] Marie has appointed former Finance Minister Mayer and new Finance Minister Reynaud to represent France at the sixteen-nation economic conference that opens tomorrow.

Britain Opposes Soviet Interference in Food Rationing in West Berlin

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 24th] The German Economic Commission in the Soviet Zone today announced the following measures for supplying Berlin residents with Soviet Zone food: Residents of West Berlin who wish to receive Soviet food rations must register in the Soviet Zone of Berlin. Those who are already registered in the Soviet Zone cannot receive rations in the West. Food rationing in the West Berlin area will begin in September, and the quantity will be exactly equal to the rations in the Soviet Zone, managed by the Soviet authorities.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 24th] British military commander in Berlin, Herbert, today strongly opposed the Soviet authorities' authorization of the German Economic Commission in the Soviet Zone to carry out the Mark exchange matters in Berlin and to control the distribution of Soviet food to West Berlin. Herbert emphasized that the Soviet move was intended to replace the legitimate city council with this "one-hand cultivated and dictatorial" organization, thereby completely controlling Berlin economically.

蘇聯能發動戰爭嗎（下）
Can the Soviet Union Launch a War? (Part 2)

蔡金聲　譯
Translated by Cai Jinsheng

Stalin's past five-year plan attempted to train skilled workers through state-managed business schools. In 1939, only one million workers were trained. Current progress is still slow. The goal of the new five-year plan is to train six million skilled workers.

However, we Americans must also discount the overall economic situation. Currently, 60% of Soviet industrial production can be used for military purposes—because the living standards of the Soviet people are very low—while only 40% of American production can be used for military needs. Otherwise, it will be impossible to stabilize the economy.

Another fact that must be remembered is that the Soviet Union's satellite states also have many state-owned factories that can supplement the Soviet Union's deficiencies. The Soviet Union is still hoping to import necessary equipment and technical assistance from Western Europe, England, and the United States, but the amount of products and technical assistance obtained from abroad is far less than before the war.

What about the atomic bomb? When will the Soviet Union be able to manufacture and produce large quantities of atomic bombs?

Senior British and American scientists believe that Soviet scientists already know the general working principles of the atomic bomb, although they may not know a certain key part of the atomic bomb: how to launch it. But the most difficult problem for the Soviet Union is building factories to manufacture atomic bombs. In terms of technology and production capacity, the key industries in the Soviet Union that manufacture atomic bombs are currently 22 years behind those in the United States.

However, let's assume that the Soviet Union can build such industries and manufacture atomic bombs. When the Soviet Union produces its first atomic bomb, the United States' atomic bomb stockpile may be equal to 18 years of Soviet production.

So, what is the Soviet Union's economic potential for a world war?

The Soviet Union is the world's greatest troublemaker. The Russian threat to peace is alarming, but the Soviet Union's weaknesses are far greater than generally expected. It may be strong in engaging in a defensive war within or near its borders. But it is very vulnerable to attacking the United States or launching a world war like the Axis powers did in 1939.

The Soviet Union's strength lies in its geographical situation—its vast territory in Europe and Asia, which accounts for about one-sixth of the earth's circumference. This geographical situation is almost inviolable. Its seizure of power abroad, its fifth columns, and its psychological warfare in various countries (including the United States) enable it to disrupt the world and effortlessly weaken other countries.

The Soviet Union does not need a real war, nor does it want to launch a war. The rulers of the Kremlin clearly saw how the United States attacked neighboring countries in World War II. They naturally do not want to suffer the same blow.

The Soviet Union has a good ideal. It hopes that the United States will do many stupid and expensive things at home and abroad—especially those of strategic importance—to make the United States commit economic suicide. Its every move and statement is to promote the shaking of the American free enterprise system in order to attack the American economy. Then, it can become unshakable. It knows that America's world power originates from its domestic power. If domestic power is lost, world power is gone.

Americans must recognize that this is the Soviet Union's basic plan. We must remember this fact in determining our policies in the future. (Translated from the June issue of Reader's Digest)

American Progressive Party Convention Concludes After Wallace Accepts Presidential Nomination

該黨政綱主張美蘇談判
The Party Platform Advocates US-Soviet Negotiations

[Central News Agency, Philadelphia, 24th] The audience listening to Wallace's nomination acceptance speech at the open-air convention here tonight totaled approximately 30,000, with ticket prices ranging from 60 cents to $2.50. The audience was mostly young and enthusiastic and had been trained to cheer in unison whenever Wallace mentioned the late President Roosevelt and to boo at Truman and the current bipartisan foreign policy. Wallace received prolonged cheers when he took the stage to speak and after his speech. The convention lasted four and a half hours before concluding.

On the surface, it seemed very successful. In addition to ticket sales, approximately $60,000 was raised for campaign expenses. All matters of the Progressive Party Convention have been completed and it is scheduled to close tomorrow. After this, there will be a two-day youth convention, which is expected to establish a national youth organization. Wallace's people said that this organization has no formal connection with the Progressive Party, but will support Wallace's presidential campaign.

[Agence France-Presse, Philadelphia, 24th] The third-party campaign platform presented at the convention here today advocates US-Soviet negotiations. The platform stated: Negotiations should be convened as soon as possible based on the recommendations in Wallace's letter to Stalin to establish an agreement to ensure peace. The third-party platform strongly advocates abolishing the conscription bill, the Truman Doctrine, and the Marshall Plan. It calls for economic and diplomatic sanctions against Franco's Spain, the abolition of atomic and chemical warfare, including the destruction of existing atomic bombs, and the implementation of disarmament. The third party further advocates the abolition of all racial discrimination, that blacks should have equal voting rights, and that anti-Semitism and racial hatred should be expressly criminalized.

Dewey Advocates the United States Should Adopt a Firm Diplomatic Policy Toward the Soviet Union

在德應有權益必須確保
Rights and Interests in Germany Must Be Ensured

[Central News Agency, New York, Pauling, 24th, United Press] Republican presidential candidate Dewey recently called for a firm bipartisan American foreign policy on relations with the Soviet Union. After lengthy consultations with several senior Republican foreign policy advisors, he issued a statement stating that the United States must ensure its interests in Germany, while also working to find all possible ways to resolve the urgent issues. He blamed the current emergency situation in Berlin on the Democratic Party administration, but said that the Republican Party will forget the mistakes of the past for the sake of the nation's interests. This is the first statement on foreign policy issued by the Republican Party after Dewey was nominated as the Republican presidential candidate.

美國會今日揭幕　議員注意柏林局勢發展
United States Congress Opens Today: Congressmen Pay Attention to the Development of the Berlin Situation

[United Press, Washington, 25th] The special session of Congress is scheduled to open on the 26th. President Truman will attend a joint session of both houses at noon on the 27th and personally present legislative bills. It is expected that Truman will propose price controls on basic daily necessities, a meat rationing plan, and the allocation of essential industrial raw materials. He may also request the establishment of a civil rights bill and the ratification of the World Wheat Agreement.

[United Press, Washington, 25th] Observers predict that although President Truman has announced that he will not discuss the international situation in his opening speech to the special session of Congress, congressmen will discuss more international measures, which have become more obvious than when the special session was convened two weeks ago. They pointed out that the Berlin incident alone is enough to make congressmen pay attention to international issues, and many congressmen want to express various opinions on the incident. The fact that General Clay visited Congress during his trip to Washington last week will also be one of the issues widely discussed. Members of the Foreign Affairs Committee who invited Clay to present his report will report the hearing process to members who did not attend the meeting.

美國怎樣應付柏林危機？
How Should the United States Deal with the Berlin Crisis?

本報特派員　毛樹清
Our Special Correspondent, Mao Shuqing

[New York Airmail] After the two national conventions of the Republican and Democratic parties, the political center of the United States moved back to Washington from Philadelphia. Today, there are only two issues that are being focused on around Washington: the Berlin crisis and the presidential election in November.

The Berlin crisis is not a small problem, as the American people understand. Is the United States willing to have another "first-strike" war just three years after the last devastating war? It's a very realistic question. After the Philadelphia meeting, President Truman hurriedly returned to Washington and convened a meeting of diplomatic and military giants at the White House to discuss emergency measures for the "Berlin crisis." Famous reporter Baldwin flew from New York to Berlin a few days ago and sent a long telegram to the New York Times from the Berlin airport. He said: "War has not yet come, but the smell of war permeates the surroundings." The sky from Berlin to West Germany is like the sky from Calcutta to Kunming during World War II.

In a time of no war, Americans cannot spend so much money and materials to deal with the Soviet Union's "blockade." Every American reporter, in a telegram sent back to New York from Berlin, after describing the daily consumption of gasoline and money, added a footnote at the end: "This money comes from every taxpaying citizen in our United States," which is very inflammatory. It is rumored that the military is very interested in the "armed military vehicles breaking through the blockade" proposal advocated by the European side, but what if the Soviet Red Army does not allow the breakthrough? This move will have a big impact! The responsible authorities in the United States are very clear.

On July 20, famous political commentator Lippmann wrote an article "On the Berlin Incident" in the New York Herald Tribune column. This political commentator scolded the US military authorities in Europe, (of course, referring to General Clay and his colleagues), as "speculative adventurers." He said, "The United States cannot start a world war so lightly, and it cannot fight so carelessly!"

Lippmann said: The responsibility for the war will be judged by historians in the future, and the US government should be serious. He believes that: First, the opinions between the United States, Britain, and France have not yet been unified. The last "note" sent by the three powers to the Soviet Union was not an "ultimatum," especially France. The French note clearly stated: "The French government does not intend to use force as a tool to resolve the Berlin incident." Before the United States unites Britain and France,

Weekly Economy Edited by China Industrial and Commercial Association, Jiangnan Taixi Hao, No. 893, Tel: 66056. General Commodity Prices: Prices Show Slight Fluctuations, Trend Remains Relatively Stable.

The long-awaited high-denomination banknotes, repeatedly denied by the authorities, were finally issued on Sunday of the previous week. Denominations include 10,000, 25,000, 50,000, and 250,000 Customs Gold Units, with legal tender values of 200,000, 500,000, 1,000,000, and 5,000,000. On the day of issuance, President Yu of the Central Bank stated, "The government has comprehensive plans for contracting currency and stabilizing prices. The issuance of large-denomination banknotes is solely to facilitate the public's need to cope with actual circumstances. It merely increases the face value of banknotes and does not increase the quantity issued. Therefore, it should not affect prices. If speculators use this to spread rumors and attempt to disrupt the financial market, they will be severely investigated according to law." The next day, Monday, under this powerful stimulus, all commodities opened sharply higher. Fortunately, the authorities were prepared in advance, tightened credit, sold materials, and controlled the market. Prices quickly fell from their peak. Over the past week, although slight fluctuations have been observed, the trend has been stable, and no major turmoil has yet occurred. The wholesale price index for the past week was 4,647,248 times that of pre-war, an increase of 27.77% compared to the previous week. The relevant factors contributing to the stabilization of prices in the past week are briefly analyzed as follows:

First, regarding the sale of materials, starting from Monday, the Central Bank entrusted the Yarn Management Committee to request the Textile and Construction Company to begin selling large quantities of cotton yarn. It specifically stipulated eight articles of the "Temporary Measures for Allocating and Selling Cotton Yarn," which were implemented accordingly. During the period of temporary allocation and sale of cotton yarn, all temporary measures for pricing and selling cotton yarn held in the cotton yarn market were temporarily suspended. As for the Textile and Construction Company's allocation and sale of cotton yarn to the replication industry every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, it continued to be handled as before. According to the new measures, the Textile and Construction Company allocated and sold four types of cotton yarn on Monday, totaling 386 pieces, with a total value of 500 billion yuan. On Tuesday, it allocated and sold five types of cotton yarn, totaling 681 pieces, with a total value of 702 billion yuan. On Wednesday, it allocated and sold five types of cotton yarn, totaling 1,386 pieces, with a total value of 1,532.7 billion yuan. On Thursday, it allocated and sold five types of cotton yarn, totaling 551 pieces, with a total value of 668.3 billion yuan, and 120 bolts of cloth, with a total value of 5.16 billion yuan. On Friday, it allocated and sold five types of cotton yarn, totaling 207 pieces, with a total value of 238.4 billion yuan. On the weekend, it allocated and sold five types of cotton yarn, totaling 408 pieces, with a total value of 407.1 billion yuan, and two types of cotton cloth, totaling 1,040 bolts, with a total value of 41.1 billion yuan.

Second, before the recent issuance of large-denomination banknotes, there was a general shortage of cash in various regions, and exchange rates were high, resulting in significant price differences between regions. Taking the Hankou market on Tuesday as an example! On that day, the price of superior machine-milled rice in Hankou was 23 million yuan per picul, while white japonica rice in Shanghai was 36 million yuan per picul. 20-count Hong Kong yarn was approximately 700 million yuan, while the Shanghai price was approximately 1.2 billion yuan. Hankou's Longtou fine cloth was 27 million yuan, while the Shanghai price was 43.5 million yuan. The price of a carton of 7-count British cigarettes in Hankou was 1.82 million yuan, while the Shanghai price was 2.6 million yuan. It is said that after the issuance of large-denomination banknotes, many shipments of cash were sent to Central and South China. At the same time, there was a phenomenon of materials from those ports flowing back to Shanghai. This situation caused prices in various regions to tend towards equilibrium, and prices in Shanghai also stabilized in the short term as a result.

Third, credit was tightest on Tuesday of the past week, with overnight interest rates reaching 7.5%. Afterward, it turned from tight to loose. The Central Bank's clearing showed a surplus of over 280 billion yuan on Thursday and a further surplus of over 2,300 billion yuan on Friday. This situation, coupled with the issuance of large-denomination banknotes, based on past experience, had the potential to trigger a price surge. The reason it could be slightly stabilized seemed to be due to the high interest rates, or the psychological expectation of merchants that the anticipated price increase could not offset the burden of interest rates. Additionally, sluggish actual sales and a weak public sentiment made them willing to sell off a portion of their goods to await a change in the situation.

In summary, we are by no means optimistic about the future of prices because the government's revenues and expenditures are not balanced, and its control over materials is limited. Serious crises still need to be overcome with effort, and we must not be misled by these immediate accidental factors.

In addition, regarding economic measures, it is rumored that an Economic Control Bureau will soon be established in Shanghai, directly under the Executive Yuan, to be responsible for controlling Shanghai's economy, stabilizing prices, and indirectly stabilizing prices nationwide. This includes financial management, cotton yarn and cloth management, material allocation and distribution, prohibition of black markets for gold and banknotes, and crackdown on hoarding and speculation, all within its scope of work.

Regarding the national general budget for the second half of this year, the Legislative Yuan has been reviewing it for days, which has been quite tense. It is said that the institutions decided to be abolished include the National Economic Commission of the Executive Yuan, the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, and the China Grain Corporation of the Ministry of Food. The imbalance of revenue and expenditure is the crux of all economic ills today. It is hoped that the Legislative Yuan can make more efforts in this area!

The commodity market trend last week opened on Monday, stimulated by the issuance of large-denomination banknotes, and rose in unison, but quickly subsided. In general, it was considered relatively stable. In terms of yarn and cloth, 42-count Blue Phoenix moved between 1.55 billion and 1.7 billion, 21-count Double Horse moved between 1.15 billion and 1.45 billion, and Longtou fine cloth also fluctuated between 45 million and 50 million. Food prices gradually increased due to reports of rising production costs. The price of superior white japonica rice increased from 35 million at the beginning of the week to around 40 million at the end of the week. Miscellaneous grains, oils, and flours also showed mixed fluctuations. For example, Qingdao Jilong raw oil hovered around 100 million, and the price of Bingchuan No. 1 flour was between 10 million and 13 million. As for daily necessities, chemicals, building materials, etc., slight fluctuations were also observed.

The wholesale price index for the past week, classified by use, is as follows:

The wholesale price index for the past week, classified by degree of processing, is as follows:

Currency and Finance

(1) Credit and Overnight Interest Rates

On Monday of the past week, the Central Bank announced the issuance of four types of large-denomination Customs Gold Certificates as a means of circulation. Moreover, according to news from the Central Bank's Issuance Department, 30 trillion yuan were issued within two days. In theory, the amount of cash in circulation should have become abundant, and credit should have moved towards relaxation. However, due to the following reasons, credit in the past week generally remained tight, and the tightness was unprecedented on Tuesday in particular. The reasons are listed below: (1) Commercial psychology is very sensitive. The announcement of the issuance of large-denomination banknotes inevitably made people fear "inflation." As a result, there was a surge in the market for searching for funds to purchase materials, which affected the repeated rise in overnight interest rates and the tightening of credit again. (2) The authorities attached great importance to the consequences of the issuance of large-denomination banknotes. Therefore, on the one hand, they did not hesitate to sell materials at a discount to suppress public sentiment. On the other hand, national banks used measures such as stopping discounting, suppressing remittances from other ports, and investigating the uses of large loans from banks and firms to block the flood of funds temporarily, indirectly weakening the psychological stimulus of the issuance of large-denomination banknotes. (3) The unprecedentedly large surplus of foreign banks and their temporary suspension of discounting also increased the difficulty of turnover of funds within the industry. Although the above-mentioned automatic or artificial factors that promoted the tightening of credit achieved considerable results in the short term, as time passed, when banks had to reopen discounting, suppressed remittances had to be "unfrozen," and the quantity of materials sold gradually decreased, and most of the newly issued large-denomination Customs Gold Certificates flowed into the market, naturally, the situation of loose and excessive credit would inevitably make a comeback, and the resulting financial turmoil would probably exceed the past.

In fact, the inevitable shift of credit from tight to loose had already begun to show signs after Wednesday of the past week. For example, national banks showed an actual surplus on Wednesday, and a surplus of more than 2 trillion on Friday. The result of indirect clearing between commercial banks and firms was a surplus of more than 500 billion on Friday, which can also be considered ironclad evidence of the shift in credit. Furthermore, overnight interest rates also showed a downward trend from Thursday. On Friday, multiple long positions were common among banks and firms, and interbank discounting turned sparse. As for whether credit can maintain a tight situation, let's see how it evolves this week.

Overnight interest rates in the past week were at least above 5%, and overnight lending at 25 yuan, or 7.5%, was slightly common. There were even cases of overnight lending at 30 yuan to 60 yuan, indicating that credit was once extremely tight.

The Central Bank's clearing balance for the past week, including the 1.3 trillion yuan that the Bank of Taiwan purchased from the Central Bank on Wednesday, showed that from Monday to Friday, national banks only had a surplus of 744.8 billion, a decrease of 641.9 billion compared to the previous week. If this cannot indicate the enormous expenditures of the national treasury, it is enough to illustrate that the so-called sale of materials was probably not as surprising as imagined.

Indirect clearing among commercial banks and firms from Monday to Friday totaled a surplus of 777.881 billion. If the more than 1.4 trillion yuan of treasury bonds purchased by the Bank of Taiwan is deducted, the actual surplus of banks and firms after No. 60 was 633.591 billion, an increase of 1 trillion compared to the previous week. The surplus of foreign banks in the past week was quite surprising. From Monday to Friday, the daily surplus was above 1.4 trillion, and the total surplus in five days was 76.047 billion, an increase of more than 2 trillion compared to the same period in the previous week. If such a huge inflow of foreign merchants' funds is largely the result of capital flight, it is worth the concern and vigilance of the Chinese people!

(2) Domestic and Foreign Exchange Rates

The domestic exchange market in the past week did not see drastic fluctuations, and the general trend was a slight decline in the second half of the week. For example, the exchange rate for Guangzhou was 400 yuan before Wednesday, 300 yuan on Thursday, and fell another 50 yuan on Friday. The exchange rate for Xiamen was 450 yuan from Monday to Thursday, and also decreased by 50 yuan on Friday. The exchange rate for Chongqing was 100 yuan on Monday, 120 yuan on Tuesday and Wednesday, 80 yuan on Thursday, and had fallen to 50 yuan by Friday. The discount for Tianjin was 50 yuan on Monday and Tuesday, evened out on Wednesday, and was 20 yuan on Friday. The exchange rate for Hankou was 500 yuan on Tuesday, and subsequently continued to fall, dropping to 150 yuan by Friday.

The price of foreign exchange certificates in the past week remained in a state of being unable to rise despite efforts. On Monday, it generally traded at 3.1 million. Although it rose slightly by 20 to 30 yuan on Thursday and Friday due to the slight increase in purchases by the Central Bank, the phenomenon of supply exceeding demand still appeared in the market. This made the export industry very anxious, believing that it would follow in the footsteps of the old official exchange rate. There were no drastic fluctuations in the Hong Kong exchange rate in the past week, generally remaining at 8%. The market price of Hong Kong USD rose from 5.42 yuan to 5.46 yuan. The highest price of gold per Chinese tael before Thursday was 339 yuan on Tuesday, and the lowest was 329.5 yuan on Monday.

(3) Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets

At the beginning of the week, the Chinese stock market, stimulated by the issuance of large-denomination banknotes, rose sharply in unison. Yong Yarn, Xinyi, Zhongyi, Jingfu, Jinglun, Meiya, Zhonghuo, Huaci, Zhongfa, Lianan, Guodai, Xinhua, Lianhua, and the newly listed Meilin, a total of fourteen stocks, all reached their daily limit. Other stocks also rose by 10% to 15%. Subsequently, it was heard that credit was tight, and various external commodities fell, and the process turned soft. As a result, Yong Yarn rose by 500 yuan compared to the previous weekend. All other stocks, except for Xinyi, Zhonghuo, Yonggong, and Rongfeng, which fell, and Xinghua, Meilin, and Yongye, which reached their daily limit, trended slightly higher. The next day, credit tightened across the board, securities firms sold short, and stocks softened again. Except for Lianhua and Meilin, which reached their daily limit, all others fell back by 5% to 15%. On Wednesday, credit eased, and it was heard that due to the tense situation in Europe, aid to China would be affected. Market sentiment was buoyant, and stocks jumped wildly, with a total of twenty-one stocks, including Yong Yarn, reaching their daily limit. Yong Yarn reached its daily limit at 11,440 yuan, and transactions were still being made at 600 yuan above the limit in the unofficial market. At the beginning of trading on Thursday, it continued to advance due to the previous day's rise. Subsequently, due to high interest rates in the market and negative news such as the establishment of the Economic Control Bureau, it fluctuated and declined. Yong Yarn closed at 11,450 yuan, and other stocks returned slightly compared to the previous day. The process on Friday remained weak, but upon closing, it was heard that the Central Bank's clearing balance had a surplus of over 2.3 trillion, and buying sentiment was stimulated. Guangdong and banking firms came to absorb stocks. Yong Yarn closed at 11,920 yuan, a gain of 470 yuan compared to the previous day. Other stocks had mixed gains and losses. It was rumored that the Economic Control Bureau would be formally established on the 26th. Prices of external commodities continued to fall, and public sentiment was weak, trending downward. Yong Yarn opened at 11,850 yuan and closed lower at 10,730 yuan. Eleven popular stocks, including Jingfu, Xinhe, and Qinxing, fell to their daily limit. (There was no market for foreign stocks last week.)

Industrial and Commercial Trends

Looking at the Hardships of the Industrial and Commercial Sectors from the Falling Price of Foreign Exchange Certificates

In the past half-month, although general commodity prices have risen across the board, the price of foreign exchange certificates has consistently fluctuated at a weak level. The actual exchange rate differs by more than 100%. According to the analysis of the import and export industry, the reasons are nothing more than: (1) The supply of foreign exchange certificates in this city exceeds demand, because foreign exporters' foreign exchange certificates are concentrated in this city for sale, and the South China region will enjoy the right to a flat exchange rate. (2) After the government uses up export foreign exchange, it does not simultaneously collect an equal amount of foreign exchange certificates, resulting in the supply of foreign exchange certificates on the market exceeding the demand of those with import permits. The import and export industry believes that the price of foreign exchange certificates is moving in the opposite direction of commodity prices, which will make exports more difficult in the future. It is said that exporters currently not only bear the risk of soaring export commodity prices but also the risk of the volatile rise and fall of foreign exchange certificate prices. Although the authorities have extended the validity period of foreign exchange certificates to one month, exporters have to replenish export commodities due to soaring prices. At the same time, seeing the daily decline in the price of foreign exchange certificates, they have no choice but to painfully sell them off. This double pressure poses an unparalleled threat to the export industry. Taking the export of tung oil as an example, the current New York price of tung oil is 22.5 cents per pound, which is about 20 cents at the Shanghai wharf delivery price, equivalent to 77 million in legal tender. However, the price in this city has reached 84 million. Although the export of bristles is better than tung oil, it has also recently turned into a disadvantage. For example, the New York price of No. 17 black bristles in this city is $2.5 per pound, equivalent to 1.3 billion in legal tender per sima dan, while the price in this city has reached 500 million. Therefore, tung oil and bristle exporters urgently hope that the government will improve its policies as soon as possible to solve the difficulties of exporters.

Regarding the export of raw silk, according to the person in charge of the China Silk Company, the export situation of raw silk has not improved since the new measures for foreign exchange certificates were announced. Commodity prices have doubled in the past half-month, and black market exchange rates have also more than doubled, while the market price of foreign exchange certificates has consistently hovered around 3 million. As a result, the distance between domestic and foreign market prices based on foreign exchange certificates is getting larger and larger. The domestic market price of raw silk, C-grade 81st-year raw silk, is already 2.4 billion per dan. The foreign market price, New York, is $4 per pound. Calculated at the current market price of foreign exchange certificates plus the equalization price, it is only 1.545 billion per ancestor, a difference of more than 800 million. In the past, there were plans to export silk socks and silk shirts, and weaving had already begun, but under such an unreasonable exchange rate, this plan can no longer be carried out.

Regarding the export of packaged tea, according to news from the Commodity Survey Institute, tea samples sent abroad to various places for promotion a decade ago have now been received one after another. Although they are still satisfied with the quality of the tea, the export price is only about 22 or 23 cents per pound. Compared with the production cost of Xinghua tea at this price, the difference is about 30% to 40%. Therefore, it is difficult to export smoothly for a while.

The further the price of foreign exchange certificates deviates from the actual exchange rate, the more difficult exports become, and the more indirectly it will reduce the government's foreign exchange income. However, the expenditure of foreign exchange cannot be reduced as a result, and may even increase due to the expansion of the war. Therefore, the government can only plan on import quotas. In other words, it will save as much foreign exchange consumption as possible in the people's livelihood to make up for the ever-increasing loopholes in the military. The large deficits of public utilities in the past few months and the continuous requests to increase prices from once a month to twice a month are all inextricably linked to the above. The government owes money and transfers part of the burden to public utilities. Public utilities can also make up for their deficits by raising prices, but the people who do not have production tools in their hands can only endure the suffering of rising prices and can only appeal to someone else. Facts have proved that the poverty of the majority is by no means the happiness of the minority! The purchasing power of the people has been greatly reduced. Judging from the actual sales of the four major companies in this city, Yong'an Company's daily income is only 600 to 700 million, and Xinxin Company is even less than this, only about 500 million. The income of Daxin and Xianshi is less than 500 million. According to the person in charge of a certain merchant, if compared with income, it is absolutely impossible to maintain its expenditure. As for the income of other stores, it is even more pitiful. The sluggish retail transactions have affected the wholesale business a lot. Now, almost all products from factories flow into the hands of hoarders, and only a small part is properly transferred to actual sales. This situation is said to be a harbinger of bankruptcy. The suffering of the industrial and commercial sectors is really just beginning!

Attending the International Silk Conference: Summary of My Representative's Report

In order to improve silk production and silk weaving and manufacturing, and to find ways to solve the difficulties in international silk trade, the French government initiated the International Silk Conference and invited relevant countries to participate. China is also one of the major countries invited to attend. The conference was held in Paris and Lyon in mid-June, lasting 20 days. The representatives sent by the Chinese government to attend the conference were Ge Jingzhong, General Manager of China Silk Company, He Shangping, Director of the Silk Research Institute, Zhu Weigu, a dyeing and weaving expert, and Wang Gongfang, a commissioner of the China Silk Company specializing in inspecting foreign silk markets. After the conference, they prepared a report, stating their feelings about attending the conference and the opinions of representatives from various countries on Chinese silk, and submitted it to the relevant government authorities. The following is an excerpt of the summary of the report:

Feelings about Attending the Conference

(1) France has suffered heavy material and spiritual losses as a result of World War II, and its territory has been occupied. However, within a short period of three years after the war, it has restored most of its construction to normalcy. Factory equipment has been significantly improved. Its current political instability is due to the influence of the world situation, resulting in many economic difficulties. However, its reconstruction work has achieved such excellent results, which makes Chinese people admire and should emulate and be vigilant.

(2) The cost of this conference is said to be 45 million French francs, equivalent to about 150,000 US dollars, which shows the perfection of its facilities and the luxury of its hospitality. But its beauty lies in the fact that all kinds of precious items used are produced and manufactured by France itself. Therefore, although the cost of this conference is huge, it can not only promote the excellence of French products to representatives from various countries, but also benefit French industry and commerce a lot, which is truly a multi-benefit.

(3) The greatest gain from this conference is to restore the confidence of various countries related to silk in the bright development prospects of silk. France has done its utmost to develop silk weaving and underwear manufacturing to a high degree, opening up endless avenues for the use of silk. It also encourages silk-producing countries to devote themselves to raw silk production, increase quality and quantity, reduce costs, and create a foundation for the advancement of the silk industry.

(4) A total of 30 countries participated in this conference, gathering experts and authorities from various departments to exchange their experiences and raise various issues to jointly seek solutions to various difficulties. Therefore, it aroused the deep interest of representatives from various countries, and it was decided to form a permanent international silk organization for the common benefit.

Opinions of Various Countries on Chinese Silk

The Japanese delegation was led by personnel from the Allied Headquarters, and its participation was of a non-voting nature. All speeches and votes were made by personnel from the Headquarters, which attracted attention. The Japanese representatives made many suggestions on improving silkworm seeds and inspection methods. Their report stated that their "three-sleep seeds" can reel 13/15 raw silk from 9 to 10 cocoons, and their quality can be improved. They can also achieve the characteristics of Chinese silk Exfotation, which should alert our silk industry. In particular, the inspection methods they proposed are stricter than before, which poses a greater threat to silk-producing countries such as China and Italy. However, silk-consuming countries naturally welcome it, hoping that our silkworm breeding and silk reeling industries will quickly catch up in order to survive.

The US representatives welcomed my representatives to have more earnest discussions when they were in the US. They believe that silk prices will improve after autumn and said that some manufacturers have a good impression of Chinese silk, and please work hard to cooperate with them. The US representatives did not take consistent action with the representatives of the Allied Headquarters at the meeting, and there were some differences of opinion.

However, the US representatives paid close attention to the production and improvement of Japanese silk, and were very interested in the Japanese improved inspection methods. They also agreed to hold an international raw silk inspection conference in Switzerland in February next year. Regarding inspection methods, British representative Gaden and US representatives supported the statement that the special advantages of Chinese silk should be indicated on the inspection sheet. It is hoped that silk reeling factories will pay more attention to quality this year, and the government will also increase preferential rewards for high-quality raw silk.

French raw silk importers and silk weaving manufacturers separately hosted our delegation and discussed how to promote the export of Chinese silk to France. The several points they raised were: (1) Their appreciation of Chinese silk, especially the reputation of China Silk Company, can still be maintained. However, if Japanese and Italian silk flood in and Chinese silk does not come, they may forget and reject it. (2) It is hoped that the original Chinese silk brands such as Golden Double Deer, Moon Rabbit, Three Jumping Dance, and Golden Anchor can still be maintained. (3) Due to the lack of foreign exchange in France, it is hoped that the import of Chinese silk can be used to purchase French goods for export. (4) It is hoped that the quality of Chinese silk can be improved and the selling price can be reduced. Our side replied that the points hoped for by French merchants would be conveyed to China for improvement. The foreign exchange issue and the arrangement of goods will also be asked to be adopted by our government to promote the export of Chinese silk to France and retain its position.

Representatives from Switzerland and Northern Europe all expressed their desire to purchase Chinese silk and Shandong silk crepe. The points they hoped for are about the same as those of French merchants. Some old customers also said that they are willing to trade directly with China Silk Company to avoid barriers and losses.

Unified Scholarships: 700 Billion Needed for the Next Term, Secretary-General Zheng Jie Talks About, The Number of Students Cannot Be Determined Temporarily

[Reported by this newspaper] The principals of public and private colleges and universities in this city visited Mayor Wu the other day and agreed on the principle that the number of scholarships allocated to each school for needy students in the next semester should not be reduced compared with the previous semester, and the amount of money each student receives should be in line with the tuition standards of each school. According to Zheng Jie, secretary-general of the Shanghai Needy Student Scholarship Unified Examination Committee, the number of students allocated to each school for the next semester cannot be rigidly stipulated for the time being, and the specific allocation will be made based on the amount of donations. In order to take into account the actual needs of needy students, the committee hopes that the amount of scholarships for each needy student in public and private schools at all levels in the next semester can reach the following standards: 3 dan of rice for each student in private colleges and universities, 1.5 dan of rice for each student in national colleges and universities. 2 dan of rice for each student in private middle schools, 1 dan of rice for each student in public middle schools. 1 dan of rice for each student in private primary schools, and students in public primary schools are still not allowed to apply as in the previous semester. In the previous semester, a total of 2,000 students in private colleges and universities, 1,000 students in national colleges and universities, 2,000 students in private middle schools, 1,000 students in public middle schools, and 3,000 students in private primary schools were approved and received scholarships. If calculated according to this standard and the current rice price, the amount of scholarships needed for the next semester will be as high as 700 billion. Moreover, the 500 students in national colleges and universities planned to be added this year are not included in the quota. How to raise such a huge amount of scholarships is currently being actively planned by the committee. Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, and others are extremely concerned about this issue and will do their best to assist in achieving the goal in order to save thousands of needy students in this city from losing their schooling.

In addition, the examination method for scholarship applications in this term will adopt the advantages of the past methods and supplement and improve them. Full scholarship students in national universities are still not allowed to apply. Half scholarship students can apply for half the amount.

Folk School Exhibition Closes, Excellent Works to Be Selected and Sent to the Basic Education Exhibition

NTU Terminates Contracts with Professors, Each Receives Three Months' Salary

[Reported from Taipei on the 25th by this newspaper] The travel expense dispute for the termination of contracts with professors at National Taiwan University has been mediated by Zheng Bingru, commander of the Taiwan Garrison Command, and a settlement has been reached with the payment of three months' salary.

Dr. Qian Sanqiang Gives a Lecture at a Science Symposium

[Reported by this newspaper] The famous physicist Dr. Qian Sanqiang was invited by the China Science Society yesterday to attend the science problem symposium hosted by the society and gave a lecture on "New Trends in European Scientific Research Organizations." After reporting on the characteristics of scientific research organizations in European countries, he put forward several conclusions: (1) Scientific research must first be based on a democratic organization. (2) Scientific research must be collective, not individual. (3) Researchers should always associate science with the close relationship between the entire society, country, and nation.

Research Institutions Need Unification

He cited the example of the French Scientific Research Center, which is a non-partisan, purely public opinion organization. The internal personnel are completely elected from scientists across the country in a democratic manner, so the organization itself is very sound and not affected by any political influence. He also said that at present, except for the situation of scientific research in the United States and the Soviet Union, which cannot be obtained in more detail, European countries have now deeply realized that scientific research needs to be unified, organized, and planned, so they are striving for development along this path. Scientists from all countries also deeply know that the study and refinement of science is collective, not individual.

Study Abroad Policy Has More Disadvantages than Advantages

At the end of the speech, Qian expressed his strong disagreement with the current policy of sending students to study abroad in China. He said that the reason why some university graduates in China want to go abroad to study is entirely due to social trends. In fact, very few of them can make special contributions after returning to the country after studying abroad for several years. The opposite results are: (1) At most, they get a vain doctoral title. (2) They create factional concepts caused by differences in the regions where they studied. (3) They consume a lot of foreign exchange. He also said that each student studying abroad needs to consume at least 100 US dollars per month, while the monthly income of domestic university professors is less than 10 US dollars. If the government can use the cost of one student studying abroad to provide for the living of five professors, the living standards of each professor can be doubled compared to the current situation, thereby allowing them to concentrate on research, and the talents and achievements cultivated will not be less than those of students studying abroad. Therefore, his conclusion is: in the future, the government should rather send more scholars abroad for research and advanced studies, and its effectiveness is greater than sending students to study abroad. Qian is the son of the late historian Qian Xuantong. Both he and his wife stayed in France and studied atomic physics with Madame Curie for more than ten years. They discovered the three-part and four-part fission of uranium atoms and became famous in the international scientific community.

University Interview No. 18: Private Datong University

At the request of readers, this newspaper has opened a special column for days to provide services for high school and university candidates, publishing an overview of universities and colleges in this city. In addition to national universities, it also introduces more than 20 private universities and colleges. This will be temporarily concluded today. However, if there are one or two schools that are not published by the exam date, please forgive me.

Overview: Datong University was founded in the first year of the Republic of China by the Lida Society. Hu Dunfu was the president of the society at that time. It was registered with the Beijing government in the eleventh year of the Republic of China and with the National government in September of the seventeenth year. At the beginning of its establishment, there were colleges of liberal arts, science, and commerce. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, the college of engineering was established. The original site of the school was in the South City. The old school buildings have been destroyed in the war. The current school buildings (No. 1370 Xinzha Road) were built in the 28th year of the Republic of China. At present, there are four colleges of liberal arts, science, commerce, and engineering. The college of liberal arts is divided into three departments: literature, history and geography, and philosophy. The college of science is divided into three departments: mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The college of commerce is divided into four departments: economics, accounting, business administration, and banking. The college of engineering is divided into four departments: electrical engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, and mechanical engineering. There are currently 2,150 students.

Introduction of Professors: The current president of the school is Hu Gangfu. Because President Hu went to England for inspection in the 25th year of the Republic of China, Hu Dunfu is currently serving as acting president and dean of academic affairs. The dean of

### The Adjacent Area of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei Provinces: Rushing to Build the Inner Embankment of the Tongma Embankment; Anhui's Director of Water Conservancy Arrives in Anqing on Inspection Tour

[Our Anqing Dispatch on the 25th] Sheng Dechun, Director of the Anhui Water Conservancy Bureau, is inspecting the breached sections of the Tongma Embankment in the seven counties bordering Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei, the Datong Embankment in Guichi, the Guangfeng Embankment in Wangjiang, and the Dacheng Embankment in Tongcheng. He arrived in Anqing on the 25th. According to him, the main reasons for the embankment breaches were this year's heavy rainfall, limited manpower and resources, and bandit disturbances. The counties did not take precautions before the peach blossom flood, and their limited financial resources after the event led to the collapses. Although the Tongma Embankment (ten miles downstream of Fuxing Town, Susong County, Anhui) suffered a breach of 200 meters, fortunately, the inner lake line of the embankment is about 180 kilometers long. The embankment is being actively rebuilt by the "First Embankment Repair and Defense Engineering Office of Anhui," the "Hubei-Jianghan Embankment Repair and Defense Engineering Office" of Susong County, and the counties of Huangmei and Guangji, who are jointly mobilizing civilian laborers to rush to build the retreated inner embankment. Furthermore, the Guangji Embankment is only one cun (about 1.3 inches) away from the flood level, and the reason it has not collapsed is due to the first company of soldiers from the security team dispatched by Commander Li of Huaining and Wangjiang, who assisted in the rescue efforts. In addition, Chairman Xia of the Chamber of Commerce hired laborers and purchased materials, and worked with the chief officials of the special commissioner's office and the county government to supervise the work on the embankment. They worked day and night to rush to repair and rebuild the new embankment with solid earthworks, ultimately overcoming nature with human effort and resources, much to the joy of the embankment residents.

### Wuhan Dikes Still Show No Signs of Collapse

[Our Hankou Dispatch on the 25th] Today is the anniversary of the great flood of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the day the Hankou dikes breached, and people here are very anxious. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau has specially dispatched many staff members to inspect the dikes in the suburbs on foot. According to these staff members who returned from their inspection: As of 7:00 p.m., the Wuhan dikes still show no signs of collapse, which seems to have greatly relieved those who heard the news.
