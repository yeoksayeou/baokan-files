### The Situation in Bengbu and Suzhou Awaits Development: National Army Has Made New Decisions, Liu Zhi Sits Firmly in Bengbu, Calming People's Hearts

[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 18th] The National Army at the Bengbu-Suzhou battlefield has temporarily adopted a defensive posture as the war comes to a temporary halt. In the Huaibei area, the Li Corps controls the areas within the three major strongholds of Cao Lao Ji, Wuhe, and Huaiyuan. South of the Huai River, the Liu Ruming Corps is responsible for the defense of the Huainan Railway. There are also two or three more corps ensuring the southern section of the Jinpu Railway. However, according to what this reporter learned from various meetings tonight, the military authorities have made new decisions regarding the current war situation within the past 24 hours. The goal of this decision is to support Du Yuming's forces heading south and to pursue the remaining bandits to achieve the final victory of the Bengbu-Suzhou campaign. Tonight, the spokesperson of the local Suppression Headquarters, Zhang Yujin (United Press claims that Zhang has left Bengbu, which is inaccurate), stated: "The Huang Corps launched a fierce attack on the bandits, and by noon today, they had completely crushed the bandits' deep defensive positions. The bandits are fleeing north in droves. In addition to the Huang Corps continuing to pursue north, our original Li Yannian Corps, which was attacking northwest, has adjusted its deployment and changed its direction of attack, and will soon advance north to cooperate with the Huang and Du Corps to encircle and annihilate the bandits near Yongcheng." Another senior general told the reporter: "The National Army is

[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 18th] Liu Zhi is still sitting firmly in Bengbu today, and the people's hearts here have settled down. The number of people moving south is not as many as in the previous two days.

[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 18th] According to qualified military sources, the whereabouts of General Huang Wei are still a secret. According to general speculation, Huang may have led a lightly armed unit in a certain direction when his troops broke through. Also, today there are notices posted on the streets here by the Huang Corps, calling for the regrouping of scattered soldiers.

[United Press, Nanjing, 18th] It is reported that the National Army north of Bengbu has retreated to the fortified lines on both sides of the Huai River on the 18th. After the Li Yannian Corps met with part of the Huang Wei Corps on the evening of the 17th, trains filled with National Army reinforcements heading north and trains packed with refugees heading south. A decision has been made to switch to defending both sides of the Huai River. Trains heading north on the Jinpu Line are filled with National Army reinforcements, while trains heading south are packed with refugees. There is some panic in Bengbu, and it is generally believed that the Communists will soon attack the city. Part of the Huang Wei Corps that has not broken through is attacking westward.

The three corps of Li Mi, Qiu Qingquan, and Sun Yuanliang under the command of Du Yuming are still firmly defending the positions between Xuzhou and Yongcheng. General Du telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi, stating: "As long as supplies continue, the three corps can continue to hold out." It is rumored that General Liu Shi has established his headquarters in Chuxian, 35 miles northwest of Nanjing. As large numbers of Communists have been discovered near Mingguang, 40 miles south of Bengbu, a retreat from Bengbu is necessary except for the garrison.

[Central News Agency, Bengbu, 18th] Military News: (1) The southward advancing corps defeated the bandit's Third Column near Liulou yesterday, achieving a major victory, and then recovered seven villages and towns including Sun Zhuang. The battle is progressing in a more favorable direction this morning.

The remaining bandits are fleeing north across the Hui River. [Another Dispatch] Military News: General Yin Jun, commander of the 18th Division of our Huang Wei Corps, led his troops and officers on the 17th to complete a strong deployment on the line of Heji and Baojiaji. Under the supervision of General Hu Lian, the morale of the troops on this line is very high. They are currently coordinating with the Li Yannian Corps to plan a joint operation to suppress the bandits.

The bandit forces on the periphery of Beiping are weak and cannot be described as attacking the city.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 18th] The military believes that the widespread fierce fighting in the western, southwestern, and northwestern suburbs of Beiping within 24 hours from the night of the 16th to the afternoon of the 17th can be described as a major engagement. The bandit forces attacking the western suburbs suffered a great price. The Suppression Headquarters announced today that the joint corps of the National Army in the suburbs of Beiping has launched strong counterattacks against the bandits probing and harassing the periphery of Beiping for several days, inflicting heavy damage on the bandits. On the 17th, the National Army's artillery, infantry, and air force closely coordinated and launched attacks in all directions throughout the day, defeating three divisions of Lin Biao's Fifth Column in the area east and west of Wanshou Temple in western Beiping.

### American Newspaper Describes Li Jishen as Being Prepared to be a Puppet

[Central News Agency, New York, 17th] The Hong Kong telegram of the American Christian Science Monitor described Li Jishen as an old warlord prepared by Moscow to be the future puppet prime minister of China. It also said that Li has denied being a Communist, but his recent speeches have all been actively pro-Communist. Li is surrounded by Communists. Whenever he meets with reporters, he must be accompanied by an interpreter who is full of Communist terms. It is still questionable where Li Jishen's activity expenses come from. As for the Communist Party's use of Li, the reason for needing a puppet prime minister and a government with a democratic appearance to fully implement communism in China is to use Li to entice talented people and intellectuals, because the Communist Party still lacks such governing personnel.

### Presidential Residence Holds Meeting: New Cabinet Policies and Personnel Approaching Decision Stage; Hu Shih Personally Visits President Sun to Decline Participation

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th dispatch] Sun Ke's cabinet policies and personnel appointments were discussed on the 18th. It is reported that Zhang Zhizhong also participated. A meeting was held at the Presidential Residence on Huangpu Road on the evening of the 18th. Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, Chen Xueping and others attended and discussed the future cabinet policies and personnel in detail, which may have reached the decision stage.

When the reporter visited on the 18th, Hu was chatting with his son in the living room, studying the matter of Peking University students coming south. When the reporter asked for his opinion on the overall situation, he said he was not well informed. When asked about the issue of peace and war, Hu said, "Peace is more difficult than war, peace may be ten times or a hundred times more difficult than war." Hu's mood seemed very heavy.

[United Press, Nanjing, 18th dispatch] Peking University President Hu Shih stated that President Chiang will continue the communist suppression war, but it may be difficult to continue the war without foreign aid. Hu believes that the Chinese Communists are Soviet-style communists, and organizing a coalition government with them will inevitably repeat the Czech experience. Hu also said that we certainly desire peace, and so does the President, but we must not seek peace at any cost.

### Weekly Forum: The Road to Production Education in China

— Zhang Wenchang

Traditional Chinese education has too much of the color of the scholar-official class. It is still the concept that has existed for thousands of years: "Those who labor with their minds govern others, those who labor with their strength are governed by others"; the elegant education and college preparatory studies of the leisurely and privileged classes who "do not move their limbs and cannot distinguish the five grains". Now society has changed. Politics demands democratization, the economy demands production, and society demands popularization. But education remains unchanged, and all facilities are still undemocratic. People only know how to consume and do not engage in production, and they worship heroism and leaders. Therefore, we should promote production education, encourage labor, and advocate for vocations.

However, since the fourth and fifth years of the Republic of China, public and private efforts to promote production education can be considered exhaustive. National vocational education societies were organized, a two-part secondary school system was established, and vocational schools were established. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, a new education system was announced, and vocational electives were offered in secondary schools. After the establishment of the National Government, the handicraft courses in secondary schools were changed to labor courses and regarded as one of the main subjects. The government advocated reducing ordinary secondary schools and increasing vocational schools. In the same area, if there were too many public secondary schools, they were changed to vocational schools. The establishment of private secondary schools with ordinary courses was restricted, while the establishment of vocational schools was easier. During the War of Resistance, so-called provincial secondary school districts were established, requiring that secondary, normal, and vocational schools be established equally within each secondary school district. Regarding the allocation of funds, it was stipulated that 40% should go to secondary schools, 25% to normal schools, and 35% to vocational schools. It was also stipulated that the allocation of elementary school graduates to higher education should be 8/15 to ordinary secondary schools, 4/15 to normal schools, and 3/15 to vocational schools.

The current situation, in terms of the number of schools, shows that ordinary secondary schools account for over 72%, while vocational schools account for less than 13%. In terms of the number of students, ordinary secondary schools account for over 79%, while vocational schools account for only about 6%. In terms of funding, ordinary secondary schools account for about 70%, while vocational schools account for only 14%. The above figures are far from the Ministry of Education's standards for funding allocation and student admission allocation. Moreover, those engaged in vocational education and those who actually run vocational schools are very pessimistic. From the students' point of view, enrollment is difficult, and finding a job is even more difficult. From the perspective of funding, finances are tight, and teachers and equipment are insufficient. From the teachers' perspective, it is difficult to hire teachers. People in the industry are unwilling to teach, and those who are willing to teach may not be competent in vocational education. From the perspective of curriculum, there are too many subjects and class hours, and there is too much empty theory and too little practical value. Practical training venues and materials are also a problem. In short, vocational education faces many difficulties, and the future is not bright. This is our current distress.

Why is production education underdeveloped in China? According to the author's observation, there are three reasons:

(1) Psychological reasons: The feudal ideology is still at work. "All occupations are inferior, only studying is superior," and the typical scholar is the kind of scholar-official who seeks to be promoted and get rich. They are the ruling class who labor with their minds, and they are superior to the common people. In the past, it was the eight-legged essay and the imperial examination, and now it is the Western-style eight-legged essay and the Western-style imperial examination. In short, they disdain to talk about production, because production is the business of farmers, workers, and merchants, especially farmers and workers. Scholars are the first among the four classes of people, and they are ashamed of production. How shameful it is for farmers to work in the mud, and how degrading it is for workers to take off their robes and do manual labor. Therefore, they learn elegant education. Even in the Western-style eight-legged essay, there are engineering and agricultural sciences in universities that teach the art of production, but in the future, they will also become agricultural officials, industrial officials, or teachers of agricultural books and industrial books. If this mentality is not removed, China will not be able to develop its production industry, and it will be even more impossible to promote production education.

(2) Material reasons: China's industry is backward, and production is underdeveloped. It is always stuck in the handicraft era, and production cannot utilize mechanical slaves. As a result, people's livelihoods are increasingly impoverished, resources are increasingly scarce, the countryside is increasingly collapsing, and production is increasingly shrinking. Vocational institutions are suspended or closed, and there is simply no need for the talents cultivated by vocational education institutions. With fewer job opportunities for graduates, there will inevitably be fewer students applying for admission. This is a mutually causal relationship.

(3) Political reasons: Why is China's industry so backward? Governance is not on the right track, and production enterprises are subject to abuse of power. Difficulties arise in security, transportation, raw material supply, and equipment procurement. Especially after the country has gone through eight years of long-term war of resistance and three years of civil war, how can production be developed?

As for the way out for production education, we believe that feudal ideas will no longer be able to stand their ground and have been abandoned by the times. Now is the age of democracy, and promoting education that emphasizes popularization and labor production is in line with the demands of the times. A new China is being created, and everything that cannot meet this requirement will be destroyed and eliminated, and education is no exception. Therefore, future national education and secondary education should pay special attention to this point: "Three parts ordinary, seven parts production" should be the basic policy for all future basic education. School grounds must have production facilities, and school courses should have applied skills. All ordinary schools should have courses and activities that combine manual and mental work and integrate learning and application, starting with the ability to solve daily life needs. Take pride in being able to labor and take pride in being able to produce. Imitate the Soviet Union by changing the ten-year basic education to a unified labor or multi-skilled school, which is not strictly vocational but preparatory for both further education and employment. If this concept is changed, and the atmosphere of learning does not change, the fundamental difficulty of production education will be solved in one aspect.

Secondly, the past method of production education was an isolated approach. Vocational schools had their own set of methods, and production organizations had their own set of methods. As a result, vocational schools were more theoretical than practical, experimentation was not valued enough, teachers and equipment were not up to standard, and students had few opportunities. Production organizations had difficulty finding ideal talents and had to run their own apprenticeship training or recruit trainees, but they lacked educational meaning and educational talent. This isolated approach is unacceptable. We advocate the integration of production education and production organizations, that is, the marriage of production and education.

In short, vocational schools must be integrated with production organizations. One department in each vocational school must cooperate with at least one production organization, or even move the vocational school near the production organization or simply set it up within the production organization and have it run by the organization, while the original founder (whether private or public) subsidizes a portion of the funding and personnel. Its curriculum and facilities must also be completely reorganized, with everything based on meeting the needs of the production organization, just like the relationship between medical schools and hospitals, and nursing schools and hospitals.

The selection of students should be based on their intelligence, using new-style aptitude tests and career guidance scales, conducted carefully before elementary school graduation or junior high school graduation, and then sent to vocational schools. If the age is too young, or the parents and the students themselves have not made a final decision, they can still go to general education, and select exploratory vocational preparation subjects during the general education period as further guidance.

The school fees and boarding fees for vocational schools should be reduced to a minimum so that during their studies, their income from their work can be used as part of their self-sufficiency, with the rest borne by their parents; or if their parents are unable to do so, a portion of the funding can be provided by public or private legal entities or the production organization as scholarships. Students who receive scholarship subsidies, in addition to internships, must also work for a certain number of hours to show that they are self-reliant and free from the bad habit of dependency. On the one hand, they work part-time and study part-time (the study time is slightly longer because the number of class hours is considerably reduced), which can increase their experience in the profession.

### U.S. Government Orders MacArthur to Immediately Implement Plan to Stabilize Japanese Economy; Aims to Accelerate Recovery and Establish a Single Exchange Rate Early; Yoshida Expresses Satisfaction with New U.S. Directive

[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] The State Department and the War Department jointly announced today that the United States has ordered MacArthur to implement a nine-point economic stabilization plan in Japan to prevent inflation and increase production and exports. The United States took unilateral action on December 10 to issue the directive to MacArthur. Only after implementing the plan will the Far Eastern Commission be notified. In their joint statement, the State Department and the War Department pointed out that economic stabilization is essential to restore the Japanese economy and ensure the effective use of U.S. funding. The United States will pay attention to the Japanese attitude toward implementing the plan while considering future requests for funding to Japan. Officials explained that plans will be developed to help establish a single exchange rate as soon as possible. However, the officials did not specify when the exchange rate would be established or its nature. It is said that this plan will be strictly enforced and may not be welcomed by the Japanese initially, but it will benefit them economically in the long run. The nine-point plan aims to: (1) Strictly reduce expenditures and increase government tax revenues to achieve a balanced budget as soon as possible; (2) Accelerate and strengthen the tax collection plan; (3) Only provide loans for projects that contribute to economic recovery; (4) Establish effective wage stabilization measures; (5) Strengthen and, if necessary, expand price controls; (6) Improve foreign trade control measures and tighten current foreign exchange controls to the point where these measures can be executed by Japanese institutions; (7) Improve the current distribution and rationing system to maximize exports; (8) Increase the production of all major Japanese raw materials and manufactured goods; (9) Improve the effectiveness of the food collection methods.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 18th] Prime Minister Yoshida, in an exclusive interview with Agence France-Presse reporters today, stated that he was very satisfied with the new U.S. directive to stabilize the Japanese economy.

However, he pointed out that the main problem is how to achieve these desired goals. He declined to comment on the methods his government would use to achieve these goals, especially since his government is still a minority party on the eve of the Japanese general election.

### U.S. Determined to Rebuild Japan into an Anti-Communist Fortress in the Pacific; Implementing New Economic Plan Aims to Achieve This

[United Press, Washington, 18th] Well-informed sources confirmed on the 18th that the United States is building Japan into a fortress of the anti-communist defense line in the Pacific.

In coordination with the new policy of supporting Japan, the War Department and the State Department jointly announced a plan to stabilize the Japanese economy on the 17th.

The official announcement from the government suggests that if Japan fails to reform, the United States will cut aid to Japan. Officials said that this plan focuses on economic recovery and aims to force Japan to implement the plan for the strategic interests of both Japan and the United States. It is pointed out that if China turns red, Japan will be the outpost on the anti-communist defense line stretching from the Soviet-occupied Kuril Islands in the north, through North and South Korea and Okinawa, to the Philippines in the south. The authorities emphasized that the United States will not rebuild Japan economically or militarily as a springboard for U.S. aggression in the Far East. They explained in detail that the current strategy is entirely based on the anti-communist plan and has no other intentions.

It is reported that the Dutch Lower House convened a meeting on Tuesday to discuss the Indonesian issue.

### Who is Responsible for the Jiangya Steamer Case? Must Wait for Expert Judgment to Decide; Families of the Victims Sue China Merchants Steam Navigation Company

[Our Newspaper Report] After the Jiangya steamer disaster, the District Prosecutor's Office specially appointed two prosecutors, Cao Hong and Yu Bingquan, to investigate the issue of responsibility. The prosecutors went to the site of the sinking of the Jiangya steamer outside the Wusongkou on the previous day for an on-site inspection and retrieved two pieces of iron plate from the explosion. The prosecutors are currently studying which part of the ship the iron plate belongs to. On the 21st of this month, the Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications will send experts to inspect the iron plate and summon the surviving captain and chief mate of the ship for questioning to clarify the truth. According to the person in charge of the District Prosecutor's Office: It can be asserted that this iron plate did not come from the boiler, but probably belongs to the cargo hold. The bottom of the ship is smooth and complete, proving that it did not encounter a mine. However, it is too early to determine who is responsible at this time and must wait for expert judgment before a decision can be made.

It is hoped that various circles will form another wounded soldier service and comfort mission to alleviate the suffering of wounded soldiers. Finally, Fang Zhi also conveyed the President's thanks to all sectors of the city and urged them to continue their efforts and continue to comfort in order to achieve continuous victories.

### Ministry of Industry and Commerce Formulates Emergency Procurement and Storage Measures to Enrich Cotton Mills' Required Raw Cotton; Implementation Can Obtain 3.2 Million Dan of Cotton

A person in charge of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce stated that the ministry has formulated emergency measures to enrich the source of raw cotton for all cotton mills in the country next year and has issued a notice for implementation.

(1) Urge state-owned and private cotton mills to export 20% of their production in exchange for 1.6 million dan of foreign cotton. (2) Exchange 50% of the 399,065 bales of US aid cotton for cloth. The exported portion can be exported quickly and can be exchanged for 200,000 bales, totaling 800,000 dan. (3) Propose to the authorities that 50% of the foreign exchange and all the US cotton exchanged for cloth be used for foreign exchange and the amount of domestic sales funds be adjusted to 4,000 US dollars, and hand this over to the national bank to purchase 200,000 bales of foreign cotton, totaling 800,000 dan. The above three items can obtain 3.2 million dan of cotton. (Note: The actual number of working spindles in the country this year is 3.6 million spindles, requiring 740,000 dan of raw cotton per month, so 8.448 million dan of raw cotton are required per year.)

[Additional News] For the past two months, the national cotton purchase has been difficult because various agencies have been suffering from insufficient funds. To date, only about 100,000 dan have been purchased by various parties. At this rate of purchase, it is inevitable that the raw materials required by various cotton mills next year will be difficult to obtain. Moreover, the peak season for annual purchases is only three months, from September to November. Now, the Central Bank and China Textile Corporation have each allocated 200 million yuan to strengthen the purchase, totaling 600 million yuan with the previous allocation, urging all places to handle it quickly, hoping to purchase 500,000 dan by the end of this month.

[Additional News] China Textile Corporation, Huazhong District purchased cotton, and Hankou entrusted the Hubei Provincial Cotton Production and Sales Cooperative. As of the 15th, Hankou, Shashi, Hanchuan, and Xindi had purchased a total of 49,611 dan of cotton. The purchase funds are paid by the Hankou Office of China Textile Corporation. In Hunan Province, due to the poor quality of cotton and excessive water content, only 2,000 dan of cotton and 3,000 dan of ramie for cotton textile raw materials were purchased.

### Food Rice Trading Flourishes; Oil, Flour, and Grains Markets Closed Yesterday

The food rice market is showing signs of recovery, with arrivals still quite high, totaling 11,945 shi in the North and South markets. Due to the market being closed next Monday, rice shops' willingness to accept rice has increased, and sales are active.

In the South market, white japonica and thin indica rice each rose by 10 yuan, opening at 330 yuan. Early rice rose by 15 yuan, trading at 315 yuan.

### White Newsprint Further Rises

Not long ago, a large amount of paper hoarding in this city was released, with an estimated total of over six thousand reams of paper being thrown onto the market. The price of white newsprint had fallen from a high of 300 yuan per ream to 70 yuan, and still, there were few buyers. However, it has recently risen again to 160 yuan per ream, more than doubling from before. According to industry insiders, the reasons for this are (1) the recent stabilization of the situation, with demand in the market not decreasing; (2) a consistent view of firm prices, with retail investors taking the opportunity to buy in; (3) the rising prices of outward transfer certificates recently, with the C.I.F. price reaching a cost of 220 yuan per ream, it is said.

### Sugar Soars

Due to the Saturday effect yesterday, and the Monday closure of the silver and money industry, most transactions were for Tuesday settlement, with three days of interest accruing in between.

Coarse granulated sugar rose 25 yuan, while Xinghua white, Xinghua red, and Taichang white soil sugar all saw increases of over 10%.

### Gold Exchange Rate: National Bank Decides Not to Increase

Since the announcement of the regulations for redeeming gold yuan deposits, rumors have circulated in the market about the government increasing the redemption amount and changing the gold exchange rate, causing market fluctuations. Yesterday, the person in charge of the Shanghai Gold Control Bureau stated that the above is absolutely not true and that the government has not considered it, indicating that it is a rumor fabricated by traitors to agitate the people, which should be corrected.

The China Trust Postal Remittance Bureau, the Central Cooperative Treasury, the Shanghai Municipal Bank, and other institutions have decided to begin accepting gold and silver redemptions starting next Tuesday. Furthermore, when the first batch of application forms was issued the day before yesterday, applicants were limited to those holding Shanghai municipal identity cards, and those with out-of-town identity cards were not allowed to receive them, causing considerable dissatisfaction among out-of-town residents. Clashes occurred at various banks. The authorities are paying close attention to this and are currently studying countermeasures, with a decision expected soon.
