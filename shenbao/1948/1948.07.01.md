Committee Members Believe Now Is Not the Time to Levy

The issue of levying a provisional property tax was discussed at the meeting. Many people spoke, and some committee members believed that it was not the time to implement the levy of a provisional property tax because if only real estate was targeted, it would cause such wealth to shift even more towards gold and currency, and floating capital would flood the market even more.

### Control Yuan Drafting Committee Passes the Impeachment Case Review Rules; Subcommittee Discusses the Case of Submitting Legal Issues to the Legislative Yuan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Control Yuan held its 14th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 30th, chaired by Yu Youren. After the Secretariat read the minutes of the previous meeting, Chen Darong reported that after the Control Law passed had been sent to the Legislative Yuan, the Legislative Yuan's Legislative Committee had decided to use the original case as a blueprint to redraw it. Therefore, the General Assembly should authorize President Yu to contact the Legislative Yuan and ensure that the spirit of the original case is maintained. Furthermore, according to the organizational regulations, the total number of employees in the various committees and administrative offices of this Yuan is over 2,000. In consideration of the national financial difficulties, the President had reduced the number of employees, which was approved by all the committee members, but there should be at least four people in each committee and no less than 20 people in each administrative office in order to facilitate the progress of the work. Committee Member Tang Honglie also reported on the proceedings of the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 28th, first describing the twists and turns of the Yuan's proposal, and then explaining the two hopes of the Legislative Committee for this Yuan: (1) The work of the democratically elected Control Yuan should focus on fighting tigers in the future; (2) The Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan should closely cooperate and coordinate. Finally, he stated that the Constitution does not stipulate that the Control Yuan has the right to submit legal cases to the Legislative Yuan and hoped that the President could find a way to remedy the loopholes in the Constitution to determine the legislative procedures of the Control Yuan. Li Zheng'e expressed regret that the first legal case proposed by the Control Yuan was rejected and proposed four remedial measures. Ni Bi also believed that there was indeed a suspicion of preventing the Control Yuan from proposing legal cases when drafting the Constitution and that remedies should be sought in the future. At this point in the discussion, President Yu announced the formation of another committee to handle this case specifically. (Then the case of "Please urge the government to expedite the peace treaty with Japan" proposed by Zou Lu et al. was discussed, see left corner)

Twenty-three committee members attended, chaired by Cui Shuyan.

In addition, the drafting committee for the impeachment case review rules held a meeting at 3:30 PM. Twenty-seven committee members attended, chaired by Wang Guanwu.

### Government Improves Overseas Remittances; Yu Hongjun Says New Measures Have Been Drafted; Preferential Treatment Will Be Given in Terms of Exchange Rates

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan held its fourth meeting on the morning of the 30th. Yu Hongjun, Governor of the Central Bank, and Xu Baiyuan, Vice Minister of Finance, were invited to attend and report on issues such as overseas remittances and overseas Chinese capital. Xu Baiyuan reported that in order to assist overseas Chinese in returning, the government has launched a overseas Chinese return loan program, which has already loaned out 1.6 million U.S. dollars. The Ministry of Finance is planning to assist overseas Chinese investing in their homeland. Xu reported on the situation of overseas remittances, stating that before the war, annual overseas remittances were as high as 100 million U.S. dollars, and at least 50 million U.S. dollars. After the value of the legal tender depreciated after the war, overseas remittances in 1946 were only over 32 million U.S. dollars, and in 1947 only over 20 million U.S. dollars. Currently, it is less than 500,000 U.S. dollars per month. The government is determined to find ways to encourage overseas Chinese capital to return to the country. Yu Hongjun then reported on the reasons for the decrease in overseas remittances and the new measures to be adopted. According to Yu, there are three reasons for the decrease in overseas remittances: (1) The difference between the official exchange rate and the black market is too large; (2) The branches of overseas remittance agencies are insufficient, the efficiency is not high, and they do not meet the psychology of overseas Chinese; (3) Transportation is blocked, and postal and telecommunications are inconvenient. Regarding how to secure overseas remittances in the future, attention should be paid to the exchange rate issue. A new method for improving overseas remittances has been drafted and is being submitted to the authorities for approval. Once approved, it can be implemented. After Yu, Xu, and others finished reporting, Wu Shangying, Wu Zhimei, Chen Ruzhou, and others successively raised questions, expressing dissatisfaction with the confiscation of gold brought back by overseas Chinese when they returned to the country, and put forward several suggestions, which were answered by Yu, Xu, and others respectively.

Key Points of Improving Overseas Remittances

The key points of improving overseas remittances are as follows: (1) For foreign exchange obtained from the sale of overseas remittances by designated banks, the government shall stipulate that the Central Bank purchase the proof of sale at a special price comparable to the black market price; (2) For foreign exchange accepted by designated banks under overseas remittances, the Central Bank may issue an overseas remittance exchange certificate. In addition to selling back to the Central Bank at a special price, it is stipulated that when applying for foreign exchange for approved imported goods with an overseas remittance exchange certificate, 75% is equivalent to 100% (i.e., 25% higher than the general exchange certificate) of the ordinary exchange certificate to show preferential treatment; (3) Designate certain national banks to absorb foreign currency deposits abroad. These foreign currency deposits are limited to U.S. dollars, British pounds, and Hong Kong dollars. Yu Hongjun said on the 30th that the above method has not yet been finalized and may need to be supplemented and amended.

### Bridgeman's Letter to Marshall: Criticizing Delay in Military Aid to China; U.S. Notifies China of Methods to Utilize Military Aid Funds

[United Press International, Washington, 29th] Senator Bridgeman, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, wrote to Secretary of State Marshall on the 29th, denouncing the U.S. government for "violating the deep concern of the American people" by delaying military aid to China. The letter stated in part: "Due to the Chinese government's need for military supplies and economic assistance, and the deep concern of the American people for maintaining China's independence, the U.S. Congress authorized and ordered the Export-Import Bank to prepay $50 million in aid to China on April 3, 1948. From April 3 to the present, the U.S. government has not used any part of this fund to purchase military supplies needed by the Chinese government. The U.S. government has been particularly dilatory in using the advance funds for the aid to China plan. Although the advance funds for the aid to Europe plan were available in April, the military aid to China fund under the same act did not begin to be issued until mid-June, and since the regulations for the use of the fund were issued, it has never been used for aid to China. I hope that you will explain in detail to the Senate Appropriations Committee why the State Department has been slow to act on this urgent matter. This committee also hopes to receive assurances that prompt action will be taken to fulfill the wishes expressed by Congress in Public Law 472, enacted last April."

[Another Cable] The State Department immediately refuted Bridgeman's criticism that the State Department had violated the wishes of Congress by delaying military aid to China on the 29th. According to the State Department, the differences between the House and Senate bills on the aid to China bill were recently resolved by a joint committee of the two houses. The foreign aid bill was just signed by President Truman on the 28th, and the methods for the Chinese government to utilize the $125 million in military aid to China funds that are now available were sent to the Chinese Embassy on the 29th.

### Supervisory Committee Member Zou Lu and Others Request the Government to Expedite a Peace Treaty with Japan; the Case's Importance Leads to Decision to Discuss at Next Session

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] The case proposed by Supervisory Committee member Zou Lu and 94 others, "Requesting the Government to Expedite a Peace Treaty with Japan," was discussed at the 14th meeting of the Supervisory Committee on the morning of the 30th. First, Zou Lu explained the content of the case, with the main point being that the government should proactively and autonomously promote a peace treaty with Japan, which would be beneficial to both international peace and the current anti-American and pro-Japanese trends. Zou's explanation lasted 20 minutes. Chen Zhiming and others then spoke, unanimously agreeing that the case was important and should be studied further before being discussed at the next meeting.

Full Text of the Proposal

The full text of the proposal submitted by Committee Member Zou Lu and 94 others: "Requesting the Government to Expedite a Peace Treaty with Japan" is as follows:

In the 31st year of the Republic [1942], in view of the intensity of the war, we believed that for the sake of the permanent happiness of the world and humanity after the war, we must not sow the seeds of revenge and cyclical retribution. Therefore, we proposed that the solution to post-war international problems should reverse the mistakes of the previous "Treaty of Versailles." In addition to advocating the eradication of the Axis powers' ability to invade, the principles should be as follows: (1) Eliminate the concept of victors and vanquished; (2) There should be no regional discrimination; (3) There should be no ethnic discrimination; (4) Economic problems should be resolved with equal and reasonable adjustments. After the end of the War of Resistance, the national policy once again made a very clear statement, expressing magnanimity towards Japan, which first invaded our country and caused the world war. Therefore, we never wanted to hinder the survival of the Japanese state and its people. Thus, we do not oppose supporting Japan. However, recently there has been opposition to the United States supporting Japan in our country, and even Australia and the Philippines have shown this opposition, which is an extremely unfortunate event in East Asian international relations. Although the United States has explained its actions in improving naval bases such as Liangxu, Sasebo, and Wu Port, establishing the Maritime Safety Agency and providing it with submarines and destroyers, expanding airfields on Kyushu, Honshu, and Hokkaido islands, retaining its aircraft manufacturing plants, increasing the number and equipment of Japanese police, training Japanese pilots, and allowing them to serve, and increasing the production of steel, shipbuilding, and textiles, the results are still not understood by people. In particular, the proposal to drastically reduce Japan's reparations, even to as low as just over $100 million, and the fact that three years have passed since the armistice without the sentencing of important Japanese war criminals, are especially difficult for our country to understand. In terms of our country's history, the United States has always been our closest friend, and in this War of Resistance, not only did it contribute greatly to the world, but China received a great deal of spiritual and material assistance from the United States before and after the war. There is no reason for our people and the people of the world to oppose the United States. The current situation is due to the failure to conclude a treaty with Japan. The United States cannot but perform its duties entrusted by its allies, and the true picture of the exercise of its powers is not understood by various countries, especially China, which is directly concerned. Therefore, there is a sense of unease in society. The most urgent task now is to conclude a peace treaty with Japan. If it can be concluded, the treaty nations can exercise their powers according to the treaty, without the United States being solely responsible for accusations from all sides. At the same time, with a treaty to rely on, if there is bias, the treaty nations can jointly correct it according to the treaty, instead of relying on one-sided judgments and blaming the executor. This is not only beneficial to the treaty nations, but also especially beneficial to the United States, which is currently solely responsible. Even from Japan's perspective, once a peace treaty is concluded, it will turn an enemy into a friend, instead of Japan still being in the position of an enemy four years after the end of the war. Although war reparations must be paid, there will be a certain budget to carry out its production and distribution methods, on the one hand bearing the responsibility for war reparations, and on the other hand being able to provide for its people's livelihoods. As for the judgment of war criminals, Japan should not cherish them at all, as they are not only a scourge to the world and China, but also a scourge to Japan itself. Otherwise, Japan today enjoys the welfare of a first-class nation, and its people enjoy prosperity. Therefore, the conclusion of a treaty with Japan is not only beneficial to East Asian international relations, but also especially beneficial to the United States and Japan. Since the beginning of history, there has never been a case where a peace treaty has not been concluded three years after the cessation of hostilities. This should be urgently promoted by China, the first country to be invaded.

Some people believe that since a treaty with Germany has not been concluded, a treaty with Japan cannot be carried out. In fact, Japan was the first to invade, and a treaty should be concluded with Japan first. Moreover, the German issue is complex, while the situation with Japan is simple. Furthermore, treaties with Italy, Austria, and Hungary have already been concluded, so there is no reason why a treaty with Japan cannot be signed.

Therefore, for the sake of our own country and maintaining friendly relations with the United States, and for the sake of Japan's national stability, we should take the initiative on the issue of a peace treaty with Japan, actively seek good strategies to break the past deadlock, and actively engage in indispensable preparatory work, drafting a treaty based on the principles decided in previous meetings. In this way, we can not only clarify our country's position on the issue of a peace treaty with Japan, but also dispel the misunderstandings caused by the "anti-American and pro-Japanese" movement, and the position of China in East Asia can also be established. In the past, the government has followed the attitude of the Allies for its actions and inactions, and has failed to adopt a proactive policy, which should be corrected. Is this appropriate? Please decide.

### Editorial: From the Berlin Crisis to the Tito Incident

Just as the Soviet Union cut off water, electricity, and rail transport to the British, American, and French zones, causing a serious crisis in Berlin, the Cominform suddenly decided to expel Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia from the party and called on the people of Yugoslavia to resist their government and replace its leaders. This not only caused a major rift in the Eastern European bloc, but also led to a deterioration in relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Communist Party leaders believe that the Soviet Union's threat to Yugoslavia's independence is far greater than that of capitalist countries, while the Soviet Union believes that the Yugoslav Communist Party leaders, led by Tito, have adopted erroneous policies that violate Marxism-Leninism, and have repeatedly slandered the Soviet Communist Party and its leaders, doing everything possible to oppose the Soviet Union. Due to the mutual accusations between the two sides, this "Tito incident" occurred, which shifted the focus of the "Cold War" between the Eastern and Western blocs from Berlin to Belgrade.

Although the state of war ended long ago after Nazi Germany surrendered in Europe, it has been three years since then, and the peace conference on Germany has not yet been convened, let alone a peace treaty. This is truly an unprecedented strange phenomenon in modern history. Moreover, the so-called German issue has long been qualitatively changed. On the surface, it is still called the German issue, but in reality, it has become an overt and covert struggle between the Eastern and Western blocs in Europe. At the beginning of the end of the war in Europe, the four powers—Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union—had the same attitude on how to deal with the aftermath of the war and how to deal with defeated Germany. Everyone was willing to create peace in Europe in accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement. Everyone also advocated disarming Germany, eliminating Nazi aggression ideologies, and holding Germany responsible for compensating the losses suffered by the Allied countries during the war, so as to ensure that defeated Germany could become a truly peace-loving democratic country and would never again become a threat to European peace. Unexpectedly, in the past three years, in various international conferences, especially between the United States and the Soviet Union, due to differences in ideology and conflicts of interest, they stood at two extremes on both the German issue and other European issues, and were mutually antagonistic. Since the last foreign ministers' conference held in Moscow last year ended in discord, the German issue has been deadlocked, and other European issues have been impossible to discuss. As a result, the European deadlock has not only not eased, but the Eastern and Western blocs have gone their separate ways, drifting further and further apart.

Taking the U.S. and Soviet policies toward Germany as an example, it can be said that fundamental changes have taken place. In the past, both sides aimed to prevent Germany from rising again to invade, but today it has become that both sides want to use Germany as a tool to resist the other side. For example, in the Soviet occupation zone in East Germany, the Soviet Union has always tried to win the hearts of the German people in order to incite anti-American sentiment among the Germans, and attempted to establish a "German People's Government" in Berlin, calling on the German people to unite and unify, and drive the forces of Britain, the United States, and France out of Berlin. On the Western powers' side, they have also abandoned the previous policy of strictly controlling Germany, and want to adopt a policy of supporting Germany's revival, wanting to turn Germany into a fortress to resist the invasion of communist forces into Western Europe. Therefore, under the leadership of the United States, first there was the merger of the British and American occupation zones, then there was the conclusion of the West German Agreement, and recently West Germany implemented currency reform, all of which can be regarded as manifestations of the policy of supporting Germany and opposing the Soviet Union. Therefore, in the past three years, the overt and covert struggles between the Eastern and Western sides in Germany have never stopped. Although there is no bloodshed, it is also a kind of invisible and silent duel, which is generally called the "Cold War" by political commentators. Recalling the results of several Cold Wars, although the Eastern and Western sides have each had their victories and defeats, they have ultimately divided Germany into two Germanys, East and West. After the establishment of the West German Agreement, the Soviet Union adopted a "cold siege" strategy against Berlin, cutting off the water, electricity, and rail transport to the British, American, and French zones, creating a crisis in Berlin, attempting to drive the forces of Britain and the United States out of Berlin, in order to counteract the impact caused by the West German Agreement. A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department openly accused the Soviet Union's "cold siege" of Berlin as a "unilateral act of challenge," and General Clay, commander of the U.S. forces in Germany, also said: "The Soviet Union is now implementing its final pressure, attempting to drive us out of Berlin, but no matter what, unless it resorts to war, any action taken by the Soviet Union will not succeed."

From this it can be seen that the deterioration of the Berlin crisis is enough to constitute a serious threat to European peace, which is by no means the pessimism of alarmists. The authorities of Britain, the United States, and France all attach great importance to this matter, and it is reported that they will take joint action towards Moscow, lodging a protest with the Soviet government, on the one hand demanding that the Soviet Union immediately and unconditionally lift its "cold siege" of Berlin, and transferring the Berlin crisis from the hands of the local military authorities to senior diplomats for handling, and on the other hand warning the Soviet Union that if it insists on its current strategy in Berlin, it will inevitably create serious consequences. If this joint protest is indeed lodged with Moscow, it will inevitably cause a "showdown" between the Soviet Union and Britain, the United States, and France in Germany. British and American commentators unanimously demanded that the government authorities deal with the Soviet Union firmly, and UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie is also considering: "Requesting the Security Council to discuss the Berlin crisis." Looking at the trend, if the Soviet Union insists on its own way to the end, it will inevitably cause a serious crisis in Europe.

However, United Press International suddenly reported from Berlin on the 29th that the Soviet Union has partially lifted the ban on transportation between East and West Germany, and the Berlin crisis has suddenly eased, which seems to give the world, which has been holding its breath waiting for the continued development of the Berlin situation, a chance to breathe. However, other news followed, and that is the "Tito incident," which shifted the world's attention, along with the shifting focus of the Cold War between East and West, from Berlin to Belgrade. Although it is too early to tell the outbreak of the "Tito incident" and its future outcome, in any case, it can be regarded as two rounds in the Cold War between East and West, along with the "Czech coup" in February and March of this year. If the Czech coup can be said to be a victory for the East, then this Tito incident can be said to be the beginning of the breakup of the Eastern European bloc.

Yugoslavia was originally the strongest link in the Soviet Union's Eastern European bloc, but after the "Tito incident" occurred, Yugoslavia has become a weak point in the Soviet Union's Eastern European bloc. Moreover, the Yugoslav Communist Party has already made a solemn statement, in addition to refuting the Cominform's accusations against Marshal Tito, and calling for unity within the party to unanimously support Marshal Tito. Although this incident cannot be said to be a victory for the West, it has given the world a valuable revelation, that is, the ideology of the Comintern cannot ultimately coexist with the concept of nation-state. Even if they are misled for a while and go astray, they will ultimately not be able to extinguish the existence of national consciousness. The Yugoslav Communist Party and its leaders have this self-awareness, which is a perfect proof. In short, the Tito incident can be said to be a disturbance within the Iron Curtain, and it can also be said to be the beginning of the breakup of the Eastern European bloc. In today's increasingly fierce Cold War between East and West, its significance is naturally particularly profound, but whether future developments can reverse the current European situation depends on how American diplomacy uses it.

### Plan to Popularize National Education to Be Implemented Next Year; Minister of Education Zhu Reports on Administration in Legislative Yuan Committee

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] The Education and Culture Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting on the afternoon of the 30th, inviting Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua to attend and report on education administration. Zhu first admitted that education had suffered great losses from the War of Resistance to the Suppression of Rebellion, and that educational measures were far from expectations. He then made explanations on the following three points: (1) Balanced development: Zhu pointed out that education at all levels must be balanced and coordinated. Among universities, all subjects should also be balanced. In middle schools, the balanced development of middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools should be sought, without undue emphasis on one over the others. The distribution of schools should also pay attention to the interior and border areas. (2) Actively promoting basic education: Since the 21st year of the Republic [1932], some provinces and cities have achieved one school per pao [unit of local administration]. Last year, the Ministry of Education, in accordance with constitutional laws and regulations, universally established six-year primary schools nationwide, and plans to start implementing the plan to popularize national education from next year, hoping to complete the popularization of basic education within ten years. In addition, efforts will also be made to adult literacy education and strengthen research on basic education. (3) Handling special problems: With the turbulent situation and abnormal society, if there are violations of the spirit of the founding of the country, the spread of poisons, or even actions planned by the Communist Party to harm the country and the nation in schools, they must be prevented in advance. Young students who have escaped from bandit areas will be resettled as much as possible, and graduates will be assisted in finding employment as much as possible. Zhu concluded by saying that education is a normal task, and facilities have continuity. All parties are calling for revitalizing education, which is also what we are praying for. At present, education emphasizes both quality and quantity. In the future, we will focus on cultivating teachers, enriching equipment, and revising curricula to make school education meet the actual needs of the country and society. This is our responsibility, and we will intensify our efforts, especially hoping for cooperation from all parties.

### Ministry of Education on Student Protests

Not Intending to Shirk Administrative Responsibility

After the report, more than ten people including Chen Jintang and Li Yu raised questions one after another, successively raising questions on education funding, responsibility for student protests, and the facilities and development of public and private school education. Finally, Zhu answered, briefly stating: A. Education funding has already accounted for 15% of the total amount in the ordinary department of the national general budget in accordance with the constitution. B. Although the reasons for student protests include political factors and disturbances by professional students, the Ministry of Education does not intend to shirk administrative responsibility, and will continue to carefully select responsible persons for each school and improve the organization in the future. C. After private schools are established, we will reward and supervise them heavily, and will continue to strengthen supervision and urge them to improve teachers and equipment in the future. D. The distribution of schools will no longer be concentrated in cities, and national schools will strive for universal development. E. Education laws and regulations are currently being sorted out. Regarding the unemployment problem, we will gradually try to prevent it through education. F. He sympathized with the movement to restore Dada at Beijing Normal University and hoped that the school could restore its past glory. However, at present, due to the provisions of the University Law, he is powerless. In addition to providing as much assistance as possible to the school in terms of equipment, the Ministry of Education will provide reasonable remedies when revising the regulations. He said that last winter, he did not agree that the school could restore Dada within one year. Even if there were similar statements, the one-year period has not yet expired, and the students of the school should not use student protests to coerce. In addition, according to the report of Yao Congwu, president of Henan University, only four students of the school were killed by stray bullets in the Battle of Bian Tang, which was by no means as serious as the general rumors.

### Peiping Christian Students Pray for Peace

[Our Newspaper, Hefei, 30th] Prices have generally rebounded slightly. Gold is being sold for 230 million and bought for 210 million. 20-count foreign yarn is 560 million. Cigarettes have also fallen in price. Due to the bank's mid-year settlement period, the money supply is extremely tight, and very few transactions are being made for various items. However, since the rice price evaluation committee has been evaluating rice prices daily, the market often reports no goods. The current evaluated price is 17 million for early-maturing rice, while the black market price is 22 million, and it is still difficult to buy. The common people are crying out in pain.

### Beiping and Tianjin Purchase Grain from Chahar and Suiyuan; Suspension of Paying 40% Military Grain

The average price of flour has fallen by 300,000 per bag compared to yesterday.

### Chen Yi Assumes Office as Chairman of Zhejiang; Says He Attaches Importance to Governance and Production; Provincial Government Meeting Convened Today to Announce Personnel

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 30th] Zhejiang Chairman Chen Yi arrived in Hangzhou at 11:55 this morning on the West Lake train to take office. The entire city of Hangzhou hung flags to celebrate. The new and outgoing department heads of the provincial government, the heads of various agencies in the provincial capital, representatives of people's organizations, leaders from all walks of life, and Chen's friends, totaling more than a thousand people, gathered at the city station to welcome him. After getting off the train, Chen went to the foreign guests' reception center and told our newspaper reporter: "I have not returned to my hometown for more than 20 years. This time, I am honored to be in charge of the provincial government in Zhejiang, and I will attach importance to security and production. The financial revenue and expenditure can barely be sustained. How to further increase revenue and reduce expenditure will be discussed and decided with relevant parties. Zhejiang Province does not have abundant resources. If we use hydropower to generate electricity, it will benefit agriculture and industry a lot. Since the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is open, if we build a railway in Jinhua and Wenzhou and open up navigation on the Qiantang River, the economic situation in Zhejiang Province will definitely improve. However, to achieve this goal, we must requisition idle manpower and funds and gradually develop. As for personnel matters after I take office, I do not intend to make many changes."

[Another Cable] Chairman Chen took office at 4:00 p.m. today without holding a ceremony. He only transferred the office with Lei Fazhang, the representative of former Chairman Shen, in the provincial government meeting room. The new and outgoing department heads and heads of various agencies all participated. First, Lei gave a welcoming speech and recounted Shen's ambitions and achievements during his 27 months in charge of Zhejiang. He then stated that Shen had said before his departure that Chen had greater talents, and that he would surely make greater achievements when he returned to Zhejiang to take charge of the government, which was truly a blessing for the people of Zhejiang. Chen said that Shen had made successive achievements in Zhejiang, and that he would order his subordinates to work together for the stability and prosperity of Zhejiang with a spirit of fairness, courage, unity, and consistency. Subsequently, the new and outgoing civil affairs directors, Du Wei and Ruan Yicheng, held a handover in the Civil Affairs Department. Ruan had been in charge of civil affairs in Zhejiang for ten years and had achieved remarkable results. Du had served as the head of the Zhejiang East Administrative Office and was also well-respected. As for the Education and Construction Departments, the handover will be held tomorrow. Chairman Chen is scheduled to convene a provincial government meeting on the morning of the 1st to announce various personnel matters.

### Allied Headquarters Approves Our Request to Return Property Plundered by Japan; Total Value of More Than 5.1 Million U.S. Dollars

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] According to Wu Bannong, head of our country's compensation and restitution delegation, two months after the establishment of the Allied Headquarters Restitution Advisory Committee, it has approved our request to return all of our country's property looted by Japan, with a total value of approximately 5,156,000 U.S. dollars. Wu praised the cooperative spirit of the Allied Headquarters restitution authorities. Wu continued: In terms of restitution work, our overseas Chinese in Japan have constantly provided our delegation in Japan with valuable information. Among the returned materials, such as sheepskins and raw silk, there are not many overseas Chinese in our country who are willing to purchase them. He personally believes that it is better to sell the above-mentioned returned goods locally. This can save transportation costs and obtain foreign exchange for the domestic government, which lacks U.S. dollars, and is more convenient.

Although the employees did not achieve their demand for the full month's salary, they were able to understand the difficult circumstances due to the emptiness of the provincial treasury and the ongoing reorganization period, so the salary demand action was called off.

It is also learned that the expansion of the security force accounts for over 10 billion yuan.

### The Japanese Situation and Pan-Pacific Policy

— Wu Jiatang

If the United States' position in the Far East and its long-term policy are observed from the focal point of Japan, a clear and obvious outline can be seen. My conversations with some of the highest-ranking personnel in Tokyo have further strengthened my impression that the Pacific region is indeed an indivisible whole, both diplomatically and militarily. The entire situation in the Far East does not entirely depend on raising Japan's production level to effectively deter communism, or how quickly the situation in China can stabilize, or whether the United States can build the scattered Pacific islands into impregnable bastions. In the author's personal opinion, victory in the Cold War in the Pacific region can only be achieved under one condition: that China, Japan, Korea, and other strategic areas can be interconnected under a coordinated policy, act in concert, and each component use its own economic, political, and military weight to seek the overall interest.

This analysis of the Far East strategy may seem like a truism, but the author must state that before going to Japan for on-the-ground investigation, the urgent need for this Pan-Pacific policy was not felt as deeply as it is today. As far as Japan is concerned, although the Allies are currently supporting its economy to prevent it from being taken over by communism, if China is ever drawn into the orbit of communism (and this possibility is by no means merely imaginary), Japan will immediately become an indefensible outpost, which the United States' money and precautions will not be able to salvage. As for Korea's position, the U.S. military will eventually withdraw, and when that day comes, Korea will either fall entirely into the hands of the communists or become a battlefield for two conflicting ideologies. Under these circumstances, external pressure on Japan is bound to increase, and the three islands will once again become a dangerous forward base, which will not be easy to defend for long unless there is another stable, strong, and friendly mainland country providing lateral cover and support. Therefore, analyzing the entire strategic situation in the Far East, it is not difficult to see that China is in a key position. Our country's situation is currently chaotic, and perhaps some people are unwilling to admit this, but it is indeed the case. Therefore, after assessing the situation in the Far East, the simple conclusion is that when China is swallowed by communist forces, the entire Far East will become Moscow's private property.

I deeply feel that if the United States cannot summarize the entire situation in the Far East and the potential strength of each region, and determine a general course of action, then improving the Japanese economy will be an expensive and ineffective undertaking. Unless there is a stable China as a force for stability in the Far East, Japan will eventually fall to communism.

After investigating the actual situation in Japan, I deeply feel that despite the assiduous efforts of the Allied Headquarters, Japanese thought is rapidly turning left, although its political direction is moving to the right. The leftward tilt of the Japanese intelligentsia, lower classes, and masses is mainly due to the physical reaction. For many years, Japanese thought was confined to the small circle of the right wing. Only after the defeat of the militarists did they gain liberation. Now everyone wants to explore left-leaning political theories. A surge of striving for freedom has pushed them closer to the edge of communism. The second reason for the leftward tilt is the reaction of the Japanese people to the seemingly hopeless economic situation. The middle and lower classes of Japan already lived poorly in the past when Japan was strong, and now they are even closer to the starvation line. Desperate poverty is a disease that drives people to the equally deadly communism. The third reason is that some people in Japan today still hope that Japan can rise again, believing that there may be greater freedom under Soviet rule. Therefore, in Japan, as in China, the number of "rice bowl communists" is increasing rapidly. This kind of thinking of the Japanese is also pushing the general thinking of the Japanese people to the extreme left. However, before the establishment of a communist regime in China, the chances of a long-term victory for communism in Japan are small. On the other hand, from the standpoint of international anti-communism, unless the momentum of the Communist Party in China can be suppressed, anti-communist efforts in Japan and the entire Pacific region will not succeed.

This analysis leads me to one conclusion: that the United States' Far East policy currently has a microcosm in Japan, and sooner or later it will follow a parallel course toward China and Japan. This development is not yet obvious and is deliberately obscured for political reasons, but the final formation of this policy is unavoidable. The question now is not whether this development is possible, but when this policy can be clarified and become a powerful decision, to be implemented with a series of bold and well-designed actions. Talking about a "Pan-Pacific Union" and a plan for mutual cooperation in politics, economy, national defense, and diplomacy seems premature. I heard this plan when I was in Tokyo, but when I asked MacArthur to comment on it, he refused to comment.

I feel that the Pan-Pacific Union may not take any form, but as days go by, some actions and arrangements will gradually be implemented. The current situation in Japan and the policies of the United States both point in this direction, and unless such measures can be taken, the United States' overall plan in Japan will not be successful.

### Comintern's Indictments Refuted Point by Point by Yugoslav Communists; Calls for Party Members to Unite and Support the Current Government

[Associated Press, Belgrade, 29th] The Communist Party of Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito, on the 29th, in effect rejected the Comintern's accusations against Yugoslavia's rights and directly appealed to Moscow to defend its policies. Shortly after the announcement of this rejection in Yugoslavia, Tito was seen returning to the capital from his summer villa. According to witnesses at the airport, when Marshal Tito emerged from the plane, his face did not show anxiety, presumably Marshal Tito personally bears the responsibility for this situation. In addition, the committee directly appealed to the Yugoslav Communists to support Tito and his regime. This situation has formed an open break between Tito and the Comintern, but on the one hand, Tito reaffirmed his loyalty to the Soviet government and the Eastern European communist front governments.

[Reuters, Belgrade, 29th] The Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party has issued a statement rejecting the Comintern's criticism of the Yugoslav Communists in the strongest possible terms. All national radio stations in Yugoslavia broadcast this statement. It first pointed out that the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party sent a letter to the countries of the Comintern on March 27, strongly accusing the Yugoslav Communists. The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party did not send this letter to Yugoslavia, which is also a member of the Comintern, nor did it notify Yugoslavia of this matter. Soon after, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Communist Party sent a letter to the Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party, reiterating the points of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party accusing the Yugoslav Communists. Copies of the letter were sent to all other members of the Comintern except the French and Italian Communist Parties. The Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party believes that the members of the Comintern have accepted the accusations of the Soviet Communist Party against the Yugoslav Communists before allowing the Yugoslav Communists to speak out. Subsequently, the Soviet Communist Party sent letters to the Yugoslav Communist Party three times in April and May, reiterating the previous accusations. The Central Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party solemnly declares that all accusations of the Comintern against the Yugoslav Communists are fabricated slander. What is even more surprising is that the Yugoslav Communist Party has repeatedly sent letters suggesting that on-the-spot investigations of the accusations be carried out in Yugoslavia to clarify the truth, but these have been rejected by the Soviet Communist Party. The Yugoslav Communist Party solemnly rejects the accusations that the party protects landlords and punishes party members in an overly harsh manner. Accusing the party of not allowing others to criticize is the most shameful and terrifying insult to the party. As for the fact that elections have not been held in the afternoon, this is also due to wartime and post-war conditions. After refuting the accusations of the Comintern point by point, the statement of the Yugoslav Communist Party stated that the Central Committee now requests all comrades of the Yugoslav Communist Party to consolidate their unity and support the government as the only response to these accusations.

### Yugoslav Communists Call Again for Union with Bulgaria and Albania; To Organize a Balkan Federation; The Main Reason for the Rift Between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia

[This newspaper report] London, 30th, broadcast: The division between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union is even more acute today. Tito today again appealed to Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania to form an alliance, but the Soviet Union had already expressed its opposition to this alliance. According to the British Foreign Office, the split between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union is because Tito refused to accept orders from the Kremlin. Also, it is reported that the headquarters of the Comintern has decided to move from the capital of Yugoslavia to the Hungarian capital.

[Reuters, Belgrade, 30th] The Yugoslav Communist Party's newspaper "Borba" stated for the first time that the main reason for the rift between the Soviet Communist Party and the Yugoslav Communist Party is that the main goal of Yugoslav foreign policy is to organize a federation of Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania as a geographical unit within the Eastern European axis. This plan was opposed by some members of the Soviet Communist Party, who believed that it would weaken the strength of the Eastern European bloc. These opinions are actually wrong. Organizing a federation with Bulgaria and Albania can only promote the unity of Southeast Europe and is beneficial in all aspects. The Yugoslav Communist Party will consistently strive to strengthen and develop cooperation with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. The Yugoslav Communist Party will never deviate from its current and past foreign policy. Although the Yugoslav Communist Party is dissatisfied with the wording of the Comintern's declaration, it will not allow it to cast a shadow on the current friendly relations between Eastern European countries. The Yugoslav Communist Party believes that this dispute is just a family internal dispute and not an irreconcilable conflict.

The above-mentioned statement by "Borba" is included in the outline of the Yugoslav Communist Party's plan to be discussed by the 5th Congress of the Yugoslav Communist Party next week. The outline states that the independence of the Yugoslav nation and country is a prerequisite for moving towards socialism and its general progress. That is, "Borba" resolutely states that its purpose is to enable the Yugoslav state and the Communist Party to consistently resist the imperialists' conspiracy to enslave the socialist motherland of the Yugoslav nation. The Yugoslav Communist Party will strive for political and spiritual unity within the borders of Yugoslavia and the closest possible cooperation with the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries, especially when establishing conditions so that the Bulgarian and Albanian nations can unite with the Yugoslav nation on an equal basis. The Yugoslav Communist Party advocates close cooperation between the People's Republic of Yugoslavia and the anti-imperialist democratic forces led by the Soviet Union to fight against anti-democratic imperialist forces and defeat them. The Yugoslav Communist Party will support all countries and movements that strive for peace and oppose interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and advocates that all countries should engage in peace-loving cooperation based on the principles of the United Nations. The Yugoslav Communist Party will also provide moral and political assistance to the labor, democratic, and national liberation movements, as well as the nations fighting for freedom, democracy, and social justice. (Judging from the last section, it is almost entirely referring to the guerrilla activities in Greece).

### Soviet Union Will Not Allow Yugoslavia to Become a Buffer State

[Reuters, Moscow, 29th] The most well-informed neutral observers here believe that if Tito and other Yugoslav Communist leaders can admit the mistakes in their policies and correct them, they can still return to the ranks of the Comintern. The eight members of the Comintern believe that the attempt of the Yugoslav Communist leaders to make Yugoslavia a buffer state between the two major camps of the United States and the Soviet Union is clearly incompatible with the Comintern's basic position. The importance that the Soviet Communist Party attaches to this matter can be seen from the fact that the three giants of the Soviet Communist Party, Zhdanov, Malenkov, and Suslov, personally participated in this Comintern's meeting.

### Heavy Gunfire Heard Near Yugoslav Border with Greece

[Reuters, London, 29th] A report from Rome radio citing news from the Greek-Yugoslav border stated that fighting has already broken out in Yugoslav territory north of Florina, near the Greek border. A battalion of Yugoslav troops crossed the border into Greece to take refuge. Heavy machine-gun fire was heard from the other side of the Greek-Yugoslav border. Greek army intelligence personnel said that Yugoslav troops have three divisions stationed on the Greek-Yugoslav border.

### Impressions of People in Czechoslovakia

Believe That Tito Will Eventually Submit to the Soviet Union

[Reuters, Prague, 30th] Experts in Czechoslovakia who are familiar with international communist policy believe that Tito and the leaders of the Yugoslav Communists, who have been expelled by the Comintern, have no other way to go than to change the policies of the Yugoslav Communist Party to meet the requirements of the Comintern. Because, apart from the countries of the Comintern, Tito may be hoping to obtain the support of other countries, but the so-called bourgeois and capitalist countries are unlikely to support a regime that is denounced by orthodox communism as being overly totalitarian and overly left-leaning. The factors that are unfavorable to Tito, in addition to the pressure from the Comintern, also include the strength of the so-called loyal comrades within the Yugoslav Communist Party, the economic pressure from the Slavic bloc countries, and the moral, political, economic, and ideological strength of the Soviet Union. Therefore, people in the Czech Communist Party believe that if Tito continues to implement his overly totalitarian policies, even if he can obtain the support of the military, it will be difficult for him to maintain his position under the consistent attack of communist parties at home and abroad. Only by seeking a compromise with party members at home and abroad can he preserve his power and reputation.

### Southern Assets in America to be Unfrozen Next Week

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 30th Broadcast: It is reported that Yugoslavia will receive thirty million US dollars in war reparations from the United States. This is the first step taken by the US State Department following Yugoslavia's recent split with the Soviet Union.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th Dispatch] Authoritative sources state that the US government may unfreeze Yugoslav assets in the United States, totaling fifty-five million US dollars, as early as next week. Yugoslavia will also compensate US citizens twenty million US dollars for losses suffered due to the nationalization of industries in Yugoslavia, and will provide compensation in Yugoslav currency for the two American aircraft shot down in Yugoslavia in 1947. Authoritative sources revealed that this is the result of talks in Washington and is unrelated to the Cominform's accusations against the Yugoslav communists. This indicates that Tito is very willing to improve relations with Western countries.

### Italian Socialist Party Congress to Vote on Future Course

[Agence France-Presse, Genoa, 30th Dispatch] The congress of the majority faction of the Italian Socialist Party, led by Nenni, is today at the stage of voting to decide whether to continue cooperating with the Communist Party or to declare independent action against the Communist Party. Observers pointed out today that the Socialist Party leans heavily to the left, but it is still difficult to predict the outcome of the vote.

### British Foreign Secretary to Deliver Speech, Clarifying Policy on Germany

Eden Stresses No Concessions to the Soviets

[Reuters, London, 30th Dispatch] It is understood that the Foreign Secretary, Eden, will deliver a statement on Germany in the House of Commons on the afternoon of the 30th, which is expected to condemn the Soviet Union's attitude in strong terms and may announce the basic decisions for the future of West Germany.

[Report from this newspaper] London, 30th Broadcast: Eden, speaking in the British House of Commons today, stated that the Berlin incident was a provocation by the Soviet Union against the Allies. Britain, the United States, and France must not give in, otherwise, they would fail to get Italy and Scandinavia to join the Western European alliance, and would embolden the Communist parties in France and Italy.

### Marshall Indicates US Troops Determined to Remain in Berlin

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 30th Broadcast: Marshall issued a statement today stating that the United States is determined to continue its presence in Berlin and will not be swayed by the Soviet blockade. Marshall also stated that the US will use the maximum number of aircraft to transport food to Berlin to support the population.

### Soviet Forces Occupying Berlin Raise Barrier Balloons

[United Press, Berlin, 30th Dispatch] The US Air Force reported today that barrier balloons have been raised over the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin, and US pilots have been warned not to fly over the balloons. It is generally feared that the Soviet forces will take new blockade measures against the Berlin airlift route.

### US Delegation to Visit China and Japan to Investigate Various Trust Territories; Security Council Debates Control of Trust Territories

[United Press, Washington, 29th Dispatch] A US Congressional delegation, researching American interests in the Pacific, announced on the 29th that the delegation will also visit China and Japan. According to Gordon, chairman of the delegation, representatives of the Foreign Affairs Committees of both the House and Senate want to study the strategic and international status of the various islands in the Pacific held by the United States, and to study the general relations of these islands with the countries of the Far East, especially with China and Japan. Therefore, the delegation decided to visit China and Japan. They are scheduled to depart on November 9th. Republican Congressman Crawford was elected vice-chairman of the delegation, and Republican Congressman Fulton was elected secretary.

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 29th Dispatch from United Press] Which part of the United Nations Organization has the authority to control "strategic trust territories" is the subject of debate between the Chinese, Soviet, and Philippine representatives in the Trusteeship Council. The Soviet representative believes that the United Nations Charter only authorizes the Security Council to be responsible for all aspects of strategic trust territories. The Philippine representative called this a misunderstanding of the Charter, arguing that the Trusteeship Council has significant control rights. The Chinese representative, Liu, agreed that the Security Council must take action, believing that the Trusteeship Council therefore has some control rights.

### Important US-British-French Conference to Formulate West German Government Plan and Seek Early Resolution to the Berlin Crisis

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 30th Dispatch] An important British-American-French conference, expected to produce the final plan for the establishment of a West German government, opened today in Frankfurt. The US delegation is led by the US military governor, with representatives including Lucius D. Clay, Wedemeyer, Chief of the Army's Strategy Department, General Howley, US Commander in Berlin, and Harriman, Inspector of the European Recovery Program.

The British delegation includes Sir Robertson, British military governor; Kirkbride, advisor to the British Foreign Office on German affairs; Herbert, deputy British military governor; and Major General Brownjohn, British commander in Berlin. The French delegation is led by General Koenig, French military governor, with a total of ten representatives. Robertson, after arriving from Berlin this morning, said at the airport that he would work with the US and France to provide the West German government with a formal foundation. Clay also told reporters that the conference would have concrete results and would not be limited to empty words. Robertson also told reporters before the meeting that he did not attach importance to the Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky's statement that he hoped the railway between Berlin and West Germany could be repaired to restore freight transport before the food reserves in the western districts of Berlin were exhausted. He said that Sokolovsky's words seemed pleasing to the ear, but had no practical significance. In short, what the Western countries demand is action, not empty words.

[Reuters, Berlin, 29th Dispatch] A dispatch from Washington states that the State Department announced that efforts to resolve the Berlin crisis will first be negotiated in Berlin by the military governors. If this fails, other steps will be taken directly towards Moscow. It is reported that Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky, in his reply to British Commander-in-Chief Robertson, has expressed his hope that the repair of the Berlin-Helmstedt railway can be completed and freight transport restored before Berlin's food reserves are used up.

### Soviet Pressure on Berlin Aims to Force Peace Treaty with Germany

Wallace Comments on the Berlin Situation

[United Press, Portland, Maine, 29th Dispatch] Wallace said today that the Soviet Union's increased pressure on Berlin may be an action to force a peace treaty with Germany. He stated at a press conference that if he were president, he would call for a peace conference on Germany to resolve the current Berlin situation. He said that the peace conference should draft a treaty that includes the withdrawal of all troops from Germany within one year. He said: "I think Stalin will agree to hold a peace conference. I am not defending the Soviet Union's actions, but I think the Soviet Union's recent actions are preparing to force the signing of a peace treaty with Germany." He criticized the current US foreign policy as having "extreme danger."

### Lie Does Not Intend to Bring the Berlin Incident to the Security Council

[United Press, Lake Success, 29th Dispatch] United Nations Secretary-General Lie issued a statement tonight stating that he does not intend to invoke Article 99 of the Charter at this time to bring the Berlin issue to the Security Council for discussion. British, American, and French representatives all do not support bringing the Berlin issue to the Security Council.

### US Demands Soviet Union Restore Electricity Supply to South Korea

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th Dispatch] The State Department announced that the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union presented a note to Molotov on the 26th, demanding that the North Korean authorities immediately restore the electricity supply to South Korea and negotiate payment terms in accordance with the occupation agreement. The electricity supply to South Korea has been cut off since May 14.

### Bernadotte's Holy Land Peace Proposal Expected to be Rejected by the Arab League; Reports Indicate Bernadotte Favors Federal System Supporting a Jewish State

[United Press, Cairo, 29th Dispatch] According to informed sources on the 29th, United Nations mediator Bernadotte's proposed permanent solution for the Holy Land is the establishment of a federal state in Palestine, with the Jewish region placed under United Nations trusteeship. It is said that United Nations trusteeship officials will prevent illegal immigration into Palestine. Bernadotte believes that this will be sufficient to guarantee that Arab countries will not be attacked by "Zionists."

Senior members of the Arab League Political Committee, when mentioning the rumored federal system proposal, stated that if this is Bernadotte's suggestion, it is unlikely to be accepted by the Arab side. There is currently no official report on the content of the proposal. It is reported that Bernadotte's proposal is as long as five pages.

[Reuters, Cairo, 29th Dispatch] Arab officials here believe that Bernadotte's Palestine peace proposal will inevitably be rejected by the Arabs because it does not satisfy Arab goals. Egyptian newspapers all predict that Bernadotte's peace mission will encounter failure and consider the Arab League Political Committee currently meeting in Cairo to be "the most important meeting since the establishment of the Arab League." Although the content of Bernadotte's proposal has not yet been revealed, sources familiar with the matter revealed that although Bernadotte has made significant concessions to meet Arab conditions, he still firmly supports the establishment of a Jewish state and insists on the principle that the State of Israel must exist in Palestine. As far as the Arab side is concerned, the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine is a point that the Arabs absolutely cannot compromise on. Therefore, the failure of Bernadotte's proposal seems inevitable.

### Last Batch of British Troops Withdraw from Holy Land

Haifa Port Handed Over to Jewish Army

[Reuters, Haifa, 29th Dispatch] The last batch of British troops in Palestine withdrew from Haifa on the 29th and boarded ships to return to Britain. Haifa Port has been handed over by the British to the Jewish army.

### Britain and France Share Consistent Stance Against Preferential Treatment for Japan and South Korea

Bilateral Agreement Between Britain and the United States Can Be Signed Soon

[United Press, Washington, 29th Dispatch] The attitude of China and the sixteen European countries participating in the Marshall Plan towards allowing Japan and South Korea to resume trade is becoming increasingly important in Washington. In the British-American agreement announced today, Britain refused to grant any preferential treatment to Japan and South Korea. France also refused to do so in the same agreement. Italy and Ireland agreed to comply.

[Central News Agency, London, 29th Dispatch] The bilateral British-American agreement, divided into thirteen points, has recently been published here. In the agreement, Britain made many promises to the United States in order to meet the conditions for US aid under the Marshall Plan. The agreement will be debated in the House of Commons on July 5th and 6th. If it can be passed by Parliament on the 6th, it may be signed overnight by representatives of both sides.

### Hoffman Denies US Plans to Dominate Europe

Recovery Plan Being Actively Promoted

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 30th Broadcast: Economic Cooperation Administration Executive Officer Hoffman declared today that the European Recovery Program is indeed underway, but its success or failure depends on the efforts of the participating countries. Hoffman denied that the United States intends to dominate Europe and impose its own economic system on the participating countries.

### Americans for Democratic Action Launches Anti-Truman Campaign

Advocates Supporting Eisenhower for Election

[Reuters, Washington, 30th Dispatch] Americans for Democratic Action today launched an anti-Truman movement within the Democratic Party, planning to support General Eisenhower as the Democratic presidential candidate at the Democratic National Convention opening in Philadelphia on July 12. Although observers believe that their goal will not be achieved, they recognize that the significance of this move lies in uniting freedom-loving individuals who support the New Deal of former President Roosevelt in order to prevent the threat of a Republican landslide victory in the November election.

### Silk Weaving Industry in Fukui Suffers Extremely Severe Damage

Earthquake Death Toll Exceeds Five Thousand

[United Press, Tokyo, 30th Dispatch] The damage to the silk and rayon textile industry in the earthquake-destroyed Fukui area is estimated on the 30th to be between 8 billion and 10 billion yen. Calculated at market prices, it would be between 16 billion and 20 billion yen. There are 36,000 textile machines in the Fukui area, accounting for 28% of the total in Japan. Most of the manufactured products have been assigned for import to pay for imported food. But fortunately, only one-tenth of the total equipment in the Fukui area, the most severely affected area, was damaged.

[United Press, Tokyo, 30th Dispatch] The coastal areas of Japan destroyed by earthquakes and fires are still experiencing tremors from time to time. The latest reports from MacArthur's headquarters and Fukui Prefecture show that the death toll has exceeded 5,000.

### International Labor Conference Discusses Wage Issues

We Advocate Based on Our Cost of Living Index

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 29th Dispatch] The Chinese delegation attending the 31st session of the International Labor Organization has reached a consensus on the wage issues currently being discussed by the conference committee. It is understood that the Chinese representatives firmly insisted that any proposed wage plan must be based on China's cost of living index, as China actively participates in the activities of the International Labor Organization. The conference today assigned two of the most important positions to the Chinese representatives. Bao Hua-guo was appointed chairman of the Bill Committee, and Liu Hong-sheng, the employer representative, and Liu Song-shan, the labor representative, were nominated as directors of the International Labor Organization Governing Body.

### Seventy-Eight Chinese Hawkers in Manila Expelled

[United Press, Manila, 30th Dispatch] Manila Mayor Fuente said on the 30th that he would order the expulsion of 78 Chinese hawkers from the Aranque Market on the morning of July 1. This batch of Chinese is the last batch of foreigners to be expelled. When the market was nationalized on January 1 this year, these 78 people were allowed to continue operating for six months.

### Finnish General Election Voting Today; Social Democratic Party Gains Strength

[Reuters, Helsinki, 30th Dispatch] The Finnish people will vote on July 1st and 2nd to elect members of parliament. The country has recently been calm, which is rare in the past. The anxiety from the first time Stalin suggested a mutual assistance treaty to Finland has now disappeared. The general public believes that Finland has avoided the same fate as Czechoslovakia. It is speculated that the Social Democratic Party is expected to win the most votes in the general election. The People's Democratic League, jointly formed by the Communist Party and the Left Party, will inevitably lose many seats. In the current parliament, the People's Democratic League occupies 51 seats, the Social Democrats 48 seats, the Agrarians 48 seats, the Conservative Coalition 29 seats, the Swedish People's Party, representing the Swedish minority in Finland, 14 seats, the Liberal Progressive Party 9 seats, and the Swedish Liberal Party 1 seat. The Social Democratic Party's position has greatly strengthened since the political crisis in May when the Communist Party demanded to obtain the Minister of Interior's seat, resulting in the Social Democratic Party defeating the Communist Party's plan. The Communist Party claimed that 100,000 workers participated in the coercive strike, but the official announcement stated that only 25,000 workers participated, accounting for only 7.5% of trade union members. The Communist Party has always used strikes as its most powerful weapon. Since this attempt failed, the Communist Party's strength has greatly weakened.

### South Korea May Form Government Before UN General Assembly Meeting

US Pressing India and France to Recognize Korean Parliament

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 30th Dispatch] Reporters learned today from non-official and well-informed sources that active diplomatic activities are underway in Paris and New Delhi, requesting the governments concerned to recognize the Korean Parliament led by Syngman Rhee as the sole representative structure of the Korean people as soon as possible, so that it can organize a nationwide government for Korea. These sources stated that the United States is currently applying diplomatic pressure on India and France, because among the nine representatives of the delegation to Korea, the representatives of France and India still hold a reserved attitude towards the Korean issue. The Korean Parliament will establish a de facto government before the United Nations General Assembly meets in Paris on September 21, because the Korean issue will definitely be discussed at the meeting at that time.

### This Month's Rice Rationing Price Agreed Upon; One Tou Per Person Sold for One Million Yuan; Broken Rice at 500,000 Yuan Per Tou Specified Only for Poor Districts

[Report from this newspaper] The price of rice rations for this city in July has been decided by the three-person committee at 5 PM yesterday. The rice price for this period is divided into two types: whole rice is 10 million yuan per shi, 1 million yuan for one shi dou (15 jin) per person. Broken rice is 5 million yuan per shi, 500,000 yuan for one shi dou per person. Broken rice accounts for one-tenth of the rice rations this period and is specified for sale only in poor districts.

The rationing of cooking oil in this city will be temporarily suspended from July. According to the committee chairman, a large number of rapeseed have recently entered the market, and there is no shortage of oil sources, so the rationing will be temporarily suspended. It will be continued in the future when needed.

In addition to Mayor Wu, those who went to the Municipal Government yesterday to participate in the rice price review included Pan Guang-jiong from the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling US Aid Relief Supplies, Kirkpatrick, the representative of the American China Relief Mission, and Hurd, a consultant from the Food Department (British Deputy Secretary of the Food Department).

### Senate Assembly Extended for Another Day; A Heated Debate Arose Over the Establishment of a Chinese Medicine Hospital

[Report from this newspaper] The 6th General Assembly of the Municipal Senate was held yesterday for the 6th meeting. It was originally scheduled to expedite the discussion of the remaining approximately 100 proposals so that the meeting could be adjourned as scheduled at 7 PM yesterday. However, as the statutory adjournment time arrived, only half of all the proposals were completed. It was decided to extend the meeting by one hour to conclude. However, when discussing the health group's request to add a municipal Chinese medicine hospital to meet social needs, some senators in the meeting hall were undecided. Finally, it was put to a vote, but the number of senators in the hall was insufficient to meet the legal quorum. The meeting could not continue and it was decided to extend the meeting for another day.

Yesterday's meeting did not begin until about 4 PM. The first items put to a vote were the proposals submitted by the speaker. The discussion of important proposals proceeded as follows: (1) Passed the request to the central government to dispatch a military discipline inspection team to be stationed in Shanghai for a long term to rectify military discipline. (2) To abolish the city's hotel industry's room rate control measures and allow them to be changed to an appraisal system. Resolution: From July, room rate adjustments in the industry will be implemented regularly after the Social Affairs Bureau convenes representatives of labor and management in the industry, together with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the General Labor Union, to participate in the appraisal. (3) To respond to the Qingdao Municipal Assembly, a telegram will be sent to the central government ordering all localities to announce the list of corrupt personnel identified by the investigation teams and to severely punish them.

Suggest Preventing Illegal Arrests

(4) Passed the request that the Assembly suggest to the city's military and police authorities to effectively prevent illegal arrests and abuse of non-judicial punishment by military and police agencies. If the above-mentioned illegal situations are discovered, they should be severely punished to protect human rights. (5) The Municipal Finance Bureau will still collect food business tax on behalf of customers. Passed the transfer to the central government for exemption.

Three Resolutions on Business Tax Case

The main cases in the review case section include: (1) Regarding the case that the city's business tax will still be collected at the adjusted tax rate, three resolutions were passed: (A) Starting in the fall of this year, the new tax rate of 3% will be collected, but the Finance Bureau should implement simplified collection methods at the same time. (B) In the summer of this year, the original tax rate, that is, 1.5%, will still be collected, but the Assembly should send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward to the industry associations for detailed reporting, and the Finance Bureau should conduct strict random checks to increase tax revenue. (C) The supplementary collection for the spring of this year will be postponed.

Finally, two resolutions were passed: (A) The two attached letters will be returned to the Municipal Government, (B) The case will be submitted for re-examination.

Public Works Proposals Passed Smoothly

After the chairman consulted the opinions of the senators present, the meeting was extended by one hour, and the eight cases in the health section were submitted for discussion. After one reading, the sixth case, "Please add a municipal Chinese medicine hospital to meet social needs," was submitted. Because the case involved a great deal, the hall found that some senators had propaganda materials for and against the case in advance. As soon as it was raised, opinions were divided. Some advocated immediate passage, some advocated reservation, and some advocated resubmission for review. Finally, all advocated putting it to a vote, but the number of senators present was insufficient to meet the legal quorum, so it was necessary to temporarily announce the adjournment of the meeting and schedule it to continue for another day today (the 1st).

### Ma Junshuo and Others Propose Preventing Increased Housing Shortage

Also, among the temporary proposals to be voted on today, there is a case proposed by Ma Junshuo and others: "After a house is burned down, the owner should guarantee the rights of the original tenant when rebuilding or not considering rebuilding, so as to prevent the owner from taking the opportunity to recover the house and avoid increasing the housing shortage."

### Tragedy at Shanghai Military Camp: Nine Men and Women Burned to Death; Front Door Blocked by Fire, Back Door Locked and Nailed Shut; No Way to Escape, Only Cries Heard

[Report from our newspaper] Geng Dongsheng, a Cantonese landlord renting out rooms at No. 44 Xinming Lane, Miaohiao Road, Nanshi, ran a small-scale handicraft factory manufacturing lacquered cloth at the same address. At approximately 9:50 PM last night, while night work was in progress, a spark suddenly ignited the raw materials. These materials consisted of turpentine, alcohol, "commander" spirit, and waste film, causing the flames to erupt immediately and spread fiercely. Upon receiving the news, fire brigades from the Southeast, Northwest, and Northeast districts of Nanshi, as well as the Xinkaihe fire station, rushed to the scene with pump trucks to extinguish the fire. At the same time, after receiving a report from the Shanghai Military Camp police station, Wu Kexiao, the chief of the Penglai police sub-bureau, personally led section chief Li Dazhi, staff member Lu Jihong, and police officers Li Xianwen, Luo Siwei, and Zhu Genfu to the fire scene to maintain order and investigate the cause of the fire. The fire was extinguished after about an hour. In addition to the complete destruction of the shikumen building at No. 44, the fire also spread to the neighboring houses at No. 43 and No. 45. It was discovered that the back door of No. 44 was usually locked and nailed shut, leaving the occupants with no way to escape after the fire broke out. As a result, nine men, women, and children tragically perished in the fire, including landlord Geng Dongsheng (54 years old), his wife Geng Rongying (54 years old), their son Jinquan (27 years old), their daughter-in-law Shen Amei (27 years old), their niece Qin Liuqing (22 years old), and their granddaughter Lifen (1 year old).

### Salary Increase Negotiations Break Down at Ten Major Department Stores; Management Temporarily Rejects Demands; Report Submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau Requesting Mediation

[Report from our newspaper] A serious dispute has arisen between labor and management at ten department stores in the city, including Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, The Sun, Lane Crawford, Lane Shih, China Emporium, Chung Hwa, Hua Hsin, and Taisun, over the issue of salary increases. The underlying cause of the dispute dates back to the end of last year, when the labor side put forward two demands: (1) implement year-end salary increases, increasing the base salary by one yuan per year; (2) a universal base salary increase of ten yuan per employee. The management, citing poor business conditions, was unable to agree. Subsequently, through the mediation of the Social Affairs Bureau, both sides agreed to postpone the salary increase proposal for further discussion in six months. On the day before yesterday (June 29), the six-month period expired, and representatives from both labor and management reopened negotiations on the sixth floor of the Wing On department store. The atmosphere of the meeting was very harmonious, and the management expressed great sympathy for the low incomes and difficult living conditions of the employees. Regarding the salary increase issue, it was agreed to continue the meeting at the same location at 4 PM on June 30. Yesterday was the end of the month, when the municipal government announced the cost-of-living index. After the management learned that the index for employees was 560,000 times higher, they refused to accept the principle of a salary increase during the afternoon meeting, leading to a breakdown in negotiations. After the labor representatives brought this news to the various companies, the employees became quite agitated and expressed their dissatisfaction. According to the person in charge of the union, the average base salary of the employees of the ten companies is about 50 yuan. Even calculated according to the 560,000 times index, the monthly income is only 28 million to 30 million yuan. Even if the management fully agrees to the labor's demands, increasing each person's salary by 5.6 million yuan, the total monthly salary would still be only a little over 30 million yuan, which is only enough to cover half a month's expenses for a family of four. Moreover, this case has been dragging on for half a year, and it is believed that the management's abrupt rejection will greatly antagonize the labor side. Both sides have now reported the breakdown of negotiations to the Social Affairs Bureau and requested mediation.

Another report states that although the workers and management of the shops in the Zhejiang Road, Nanjing Road, Sichuan Road, and Linsen Road districts of the Chinese and foreign department store industry did not have representatives participating in the negotiations, the employee treatment in the Chinese and foreign department store industry has always followed the lead of the Universal Department Store industry (i.e., the aforementioned ten companies). Therefore, yesterday, both sides quickly contacted the labor and management authorities of the Universal Department Store industry and will take the same steps, it is said.

### Ballroom Tea Charge: 1.2 Million Yuan Per Cup

The musicians of the city's ballrooms, due to the recent soaring prices, are unable to make a living. Therefore, they recently submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau to forward to the management a demand for a 150-fold salary increase. The Social Affairs Bureau stated that musicians are independent professionals and can directly negotiate with the management. It has been learned that after representatives were elected to discuss with the management, the management has agreed to make adjustments. According to another report: Starting today, the tea charge in ballrooms will also be doubled to 1.2 million yuan.

### Western Film Distributors Suspend Supply of New Films; Cinema Industry Believes It Is Illegal

Losses Will Be Claimed for Compensation

[Report from our newspaper] After the city's nine Western film distributors decided to suspend the supply of new films to cinemas, the cinema industry association convened a special meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures. During the meeting, it was unanimously agreed that the restriction of cinema ticket prices is based on the laws and regulations of our government, and Western film distributors should not blame the cinemas for their failure to achieve satisfactory adjustments. The sole reason for the Western film distributors' suspension of the supply of new films is based on the "force majeure" clause in the contract, but government laws and regulations are not natural disasters or man-made calamities and cannot be considered "force majeure" at all. Moreover, the contract agreed upon by both the cinemas and the distributors did not make any rigid provisions on ticket prices, and the distributors should not unilaterally use the suspension of the supply of new films as a means of coercing price increases. Therefore, the result was a resolution to regard the actions of the Western film distributors as illegal acts, and during the period of their suspension of the supply of new films, the cinemas reserve the right to claim compensation for the losses incurred. The association has sent the minutes of the resolution to the Western film distributors yesterday.

General Labor Union Requests Improvements in Compilation; Authorities Adopted All

Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Labor Union, made the following remarks to a Dagong News reporter regarding the workers' cost of living index: Recently, unions in the cotton spinning, printing, cigarette, and water and electricity installation industries have submitted requests to improve the compilation of the index and conduct a new household survey. The General Labor Union, recognizing that the increase in the index is not keeping pace with prices, affecting the lives of ordinary workers, recently submitted several requests to the Social Affairs Bureau: (1) The index should be published every half month; (2) The price of coal briquettes should be calculated at the market price, not the rationed price; (3) A new household survey should be conducted; (4) Due to the drastic price increases in the latter half of June, another price survey should be conducted and included in the total index for June. Of the above four items, except for the third item, the household survey, which requires a cost of over 1 billion yuan and a duration of one and a half years, is still under consideration. The remaining items (1), (2), and (4) have all been adopted by the authorities, demonstrating the government's concern for the livelihood of workers. Regarding the details of this process, the General Labor Union has scheduled a meeting of the executive committee at 2 PM today to present a report. Although the General Labor Union does not send personnel to participate in the compilation of the cost of living index, union representatives attend the review at the end of each month. The June index has been reviewed and is consistent with the prices surveyed by the General Labor Union. At a time when prices and the index are spiraling upwards, it is difficult for industry and commerce to maintain operations. Only mutual understanding between labor and management can help overcome the difficulties. The General Labor Union will safeguard the legitimate interests of workers and hopes that workers will work with peace of mind and strive for production.

Convening a Forum for Various Unions

The General Labor Union has scheduled a forum for the heads of various unions in the coming days to report on the progress of the request to the government to improve the compilation of the index. At the same time, labor representatives to the Municipal Council will report on the discussions regarding labor issues in the current session of the Municipal Council.

### Stepmother Loses Her Mind After Marriage, Bizarre Cause of Death; Father, Daughter, and Another Person Prosecuted on Suspicion of Assisting Suicide

[Report from our newspaper] Ren Guae, a woman from Yu Hang, previously married Ruan Bingfa, a worker at Shanghai No. 15 Textile Mill, as his second wife. Unexpectedly, after the marriage, she became delusional and claimed to have witnessed Ruan's previous wife with disheveled hair, causing her to become mentally disturbed. On April 21, she secretly swallowed four gold rings in a suicide attempt, which failed. On the 24th, she fatally slashed her throat with scissors and died. Afterwards, Ren's brother, Ren Benyuan, believing that Ren's death was suspicious, came to Shanghai from Hangzhou, accompanied Ruan Bingfa, and Wang Hanxiang, the cousin of Ruan's previous wife, to report the incident to the Yulin Road Police Station. Ruan Bingfa, Wang Hanqing, Ruan Genyou (the daughter of Ruan's previous wife), Peng Aying, and Cai Ruanshi (a relative of Ruan who shared a room with the deceased), were transferred to the district procuratorate for investigation on suspicion of assisting suicide. At the same time, Ren Benyuan also accused Ruan Bingfa, Wang Hanqing, and Peng Aying of suspicion of murder. After the district procuratorate concluded its investigation, except for Cai Ruanshi and Peng Aying, who were exempted from prosecution, Ruan and the other three were prosecuted on suspicion of assisting suicide. After an autopsy, it was proven that the deceased had no signs of resistance. However, after the deceased attempted suicide by swallowing gold, Ruan sent her to the No. 2 Hospital of the China Textile Mill on Ningguo Road for treatment. An X-ray revealed three gold rings in her abdomen. Dr. Lin Xi of the hospital instructed her to be hospitalized, but Ren refused and returned home with medication. However, he did not report it to the police station. When Ren committed suicide for the second time, Ruan and others still did not report it to the police station and failed to take preventive measures beforehand, resulting in Ren's death. This constitutes the crimes of Article 15, Paragraph 1, and Article 275, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law.

### Case of Melting and Selling Gold Bars Arouses Concern of City Councilors; Believe Thorough Investigation and Strict Handling Should Be Conducted Immediately; Emergency Motion to Be Proposed Today

[Report from our newspaper] After the authorities cracked down on the black market gold organization that melted and sold gold bars for profit at Jintai Yarn Shop, No. 331 Jiangxi Middle Road, the city's various sectors have been paying close attention. As for the reported involvement of a certain agency personnel with Hu Xinyi, it was confirmed yesterday that he has been dismissed from his position by the agency he served.

Some city councilors have expressed outrage and believe that if Hu Xinyi has indeed disrupted the financial market and harmed people's livelihood, he should be thoroughly investigated and severely punished. Otherwise, the authorities should explain the whole case to dispel public doubts. It is said that they will jointly propose an emergency temporary motion today, requesting a thorough investigation of the case.

### Elegy of the Flooded South

— Our Special Correspondent Liang Feng

[Guangzhou Dispatch, 27th by Airmail] The Southland in summer was tranquil. Although the high exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars had sent prices soaring, exceeding those of Beijing and Shanghai, the price of grain had been stable for some time, thanks to the allocation of American aid rice. This spring, abundant rain had made farmers celebrate and anticipate a bountiful harvest. They made plans to race dragon boats on the Dragon Boat Festival, hoping for a good harvest. However, the dream turned into a nightmare. An overseas hurricane arrived with the Dragon Boat Festival, followed by torrential rain. The East, West, North, and Han rivers in Guangdong Province experienced mountain floods and a surge in water levels, sounding the alarm of a flood disaster. The joyous and harmonious pastoral symphony of the Southland transformed into a tragic elegy. The hopes for a harvest vanished with the wind!

Impact of the Storm

According to a spokesperson from the Pearl River Water Conservancy Bureau, the flood was caused by a rainstorm. It was not yet the flood season in the seventh lunar month, and the flood was just a prelude. However, the losses were already alarming. As the floodwaters have not fully receded, a precise statistic is not yet available. Based on reports from various counties, the situation is roughly as follows: The Eastern River experienced the most severe flooding, with water levels rising by more than 20 feet in just a few days. The Yuanzhou Dike in Shilong was the first to be breached, with a gap of more than 200 meters, flooding more than 30,000 mu of fertile land. The paddy fields along the Huizhou and Boluo rivers were also submerged. The disaster in Xinhui, Heshan, Kaiping, and Zhanjiang and Suixi in the South Road was particularly severe. The flood-affected area in Xinhui accounted for 70-80% of the county. In Taishan, more than 2,000 houses were destroyed in just one district, leaving thousands of people displaced. The loss of livestock and paddy fields is impossible to estimate.

Severe Disaster in Siyi and South Road

In the South Road area, more than 10,000 mu of fertile land were flooded in Suixi County alone, and more than 1,000 houses were destroyed. In Zhanjiang City, more than 3,000 houses were destroyed, and more than 100 residents were drowned or went missing. Countless residents fled their homes and were forced to live in the open at the Xiying Airport, crying for food. The devastation in the Siyi and South Road areas is unprecedented in a century.

Chairman Song Ziwen, upon taking office last year, stated that preventing floods was the urgent priority for the construction of Guangdong. At the end of last year, the Provincial Dike Engineering Association was established, and it was decided that the first step would be to restore the dikes to their pre-flood state last year, and then strengthen and repair the dikes. The first phase of the work has been completed. Song also planned to complete permanent water conservancy construction projects within a few years.

Hoping the Flood Is the End

Regarding relief efforts, Guangdong is to issue 50 billion yuan in emergency aid to Taishan, Xinhui, and Kaiping counties, and another 10 billion yuan in emergency aid to Zhanjiang, Suixi, and Haikang cities. Two emergency aid groups have been established for the Siyi and Leizhan regions, and they have already set off. In addition, the Dike Engineering Association and the Water Conservancy Bureau have sent a large number of technicians to the valleys to guide the people in repairing the breached dikes. According to reports from various counties, although the water is fierce, the main dikes are still strong, and there is no sign of danger. The sudden flood may be the last, and the urgent task is to step up relief efforts.

### Lanxi Reporters Association Organizes Public Election of Wealthy Individuals

[Lanxi Dispatch, 28th] To assist the government in collecting pacification funds from wealthy merchants and households, the Lanxi Journalists Association, through three meetings of the board of directors, decided to hold a public election of wealthy individuals.

### Students Beat Teacher for Demanding Changing the Test Questions

[Shangrao Dispatch, 28th] A case of students beating a teacher occurred at the private Zhu Tong Middle School. High school students Shu Guangbin, Yu Liji, Wang Enrong, and others thought that the math test questions set by Ye Menglin, the director of the school's guidance office, were too difficult. They gathered and questioned Ye, demanding a change of questions. Ye responded that the purpose of the exam was to assess students' performance and improve their level, and he was purely acting out of good intentions to encourage students to study. When they did not get the result they wanted, the students used violence against Ye, beating him severely and injuring him. Two workers who went to rescue him were also beaten. Afterwards, the school transferred Shu Guangbin and others to the county government for interrogation by the local prosecutor's office.

Jin Shaoshan before makeup (Dedicated to Yellow Prince by Ha Sha)

### Jin Shaoshan by the Stove

— Our Reporter Hong Zhenglun

"Living Overlord" Jin Shaoshan was a famous Northern opera performer in Jiangnan. Now he is quietly lying in an old, dark house in Beiping, accompanied by a medicine stove and tea stove, spending the rest of his life in illness, feeling particularly desolate. As for his fate, as of today, we still cannot predict it. Knowing that many readers are concerned about the life of the Overlord, our reporter made a visit and will publish it in two parts. (Editor)

[Beiping Dispatch, 27th by Airmail] Overlord Jin is sick, and very sick. His illness is partly due to years of hard work as a performer, and partly due to his willfulness, eccentricity, and excessive indulgence in wine and women. But his illness can also be said to be sudden. According to drama critic Ha Sha Huang, one winter last year, after Jin Shaoshan performed "Qingfeng Village" at the Sanqing Theater to慰劳(entertaining the troop), he vomited continuously and his breathing was weak. The situation was extremely dangerous at that time. After a Western doctor named Jing diagnosed him, he determined that he had peritonitis. The vomiting stopped slightly after the injection, but he was not out of danger.

Disobeying Doctor's Orders, Eating Mutton

Mr. Jing instructed him to be careful with his diet and pay attention to his movements, but Jin Shaoshan did not comply. After a day, he had a full meal of mutton, and his condition deteriorated sharply. At first, he had pain in his limbs, then swelling all over his body. The doctor diagnosed him with "peripheral neuritis." From that time on, his condition has been in a fluctuating state, lasting until now. Overlord Jin has been suffering for more than half a year!

Following the threat of illness is poverty. Although Overlord Jin has enjoyed fame in the art world for decades, he could not save any money in the golden age when he was used to extravagance. Today, of course, he only has empty hands. So after spending these long seven months, in addition to pawning and selling things to support the family's living expenses and medical expenses, everything else has relied on sponsorship from colleagues and friends. Although the number is considerable, using limited friendship support to fill this endless economic hole, the future is terrible.

"Sharing Tables" Charity Performance, Famous Performers Help

Recently, Ha Sha Huang and others initiated a "sharing tables" charity performance for Overlord Jin at the Chang'an Theater, with famous Beiping performers Qiu Shengrong, Xun Huisheng, Yang Baosen, Ye Shenglan, Li Duokui, Ma Fulu, Shang Xiaoyun, Tan Xiaopei, Tan Fuying, and others. If this can be realized, it will indeed be a gathering of the famous performers in Beiping at that time, and the results will be considerable, which will be of great help to his illness. When the reporter visited him, it was a hot afternoon. The Overlord was half-naked, with a cloth wrapped around his lower body, lying diagonally on the sickbed. The sickroom was the east room of a row of five rooms facing north and south. Because no one had cleaned it for a long time, the spacious room seemed unusually messy and narrow. The Overlord's face was so sallow, and his swollen feet could not even move. What was strange was that his voice was still so loud, and his eyes were still so bright, but the spirit was so far away from the spirit of the performing time.

Bad Temper, Difficult to Predict Destiny

Accompanying the reporter to his house was an old friend, Zhou Yanchen, who was specially serving him. Mr. Zhou is already 62 years old. He is the Overlord's sworn friend and Yang Xiaolou's apprentice, practicing martial arts. Since Jin Shaoshan fell ill, he has been dedicated to serving him. After Mr. Zhou explained the purpose of the visit to the Overlord, Jin Shaoshan slightly bowed, indicating to offer a seat. Because of his long-term illness, the Overlord was very lazy and did not say much, so we said goodbye. According to Mr. Zhou, Jin Sanye (because he is the third in the family, the Liyuan industry calls him Jin San) has a very bad temper. The doctor instructed him to only eat some thin things, but he wanted to eat meat buns and fried noodles. There was no way to stop him, such a weird temper that he didn't even care about his life, he said with emotion.

### Moganshan is Flourishing

— Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

[Hangzhou Dispatch, 28th] To go to Moganshan from Hangzhou, first take the Jinghang National Highway for 51 kilometers to Sanqiaobu, then turn onto the 7-kilometer road to Yucun at the foot of Moganshan. Generally speaking, the car ride on this 58-kilometer journey is much better than the bumpy state in April 1946. Moreover, several sections of the road are quite smooth, the bridges have been repaired, and the mileage markers are very clear.

Arriving at the foot of Moganshan, porters and sedan chair carriers are waiting for you to hire them. If you want to use them, you must negotiate with the management staff under the awning. To carry a load, the slow rate is 500,000 yuan, and the fast rate is 700,000 yuan. A sedan chair with three carriers costs 1.5 million yuan.

White rice on the mountain sells for 10 million yuan per dan, pork sells for 260,000 yuan per catty, and eggs sell for 15,000 yuan each. Except for white rice, other items are more expensive than in Hangzhou. However, the prices of mountain hotels are surprisingly high. The Moganshan Hotel costs 4 million yuan per day, including meals. There are also the Fuxing Hotel, the Luyin Hotel, etc., and the prices are quite expensive.

On the mountain, the sounds of sawing, hammering, and booming never stop. Many houses are under repair. Of the more than 300 houses on the mountain, only about 0.9% were destroyed. With red houses and green tiles interspersed among the green bamboo and trees, Moganshan does have a flourishing atmosphere.

This year, many homeowners are renting their houses to foreigners, with each house being rented for three months at a price of 40-50 dan of rice. Russians are the most common renters, with very few people from other countries. There are only one or two Americans. Some of these Russians open restaurants in the mountains after renting, while others rent and let many other Russians live there.

The climate here is cool, with the highest record not exceeding 80 degrees. It feels particularly cold at night, and you must cover yourself with bedding to sleep. In the early morning, you can watch the sunrise and the sea of clouds. In the evening, you can watch the sunset and the misty fog. The only drawback of Moganshan is that there is no river or sea, but you can see Taihu Lake and the Qiantang River from inside a certain house.

After all, this is not a peaceful and prosperous age, so there are more foreigners than Chinese coming to the mountains. We hope that next year there will be more Chinese than foreigners in the mountains.

### Unable to Endure High Prices, Old Woman in Quzhou Dies by Hanging from Beam

[Qu County Dispatch, 28th] Jie Zhaobing, a carpenter and resident of Xiaoximen in this county, has a wife, Jie Jiang, 42 years old. She is usually weak and sick and unable to afford treatment. Recently, due to soaring prices, her husband's daily income is not enough to support the family, so she had the thought of厭世 (ending her life). On the morning of the 27th, she took advantage of the fact that no one was watching and hanged herself. When she was discovered, she was already dead.

### Export Industry Still Lacking Improvement After Implementation of Foreign Exchange Certificate Measures

[Our Report] After the implementation of foreign exchange certificate measures, China's export industry still lacks improvement. According to import and export industry insiders, the reasons are nothing more than the following: (1) Domestic prices are soaring, and the prices of export goods have also increased by more than double. Exporters are limited by funds and unable to purchase on a large scale. When foreign sales are sluggish, merchants have to sell at low prices to endure losses because the foreign exchange period is fixed. (2) The market price of foreign exchange certificates is lower than the black market price of US dollars by an average of more than 30% due to the financial authorities' planned suppression. When the selling price of foreign exchange certificates cannot be consistent with the black market price of US dollars, there are problems with exports and overseas remittances. Currently, there are two trends in the operation of the export industry: one is that small exporters have to jointly handle business with large exporters due to limited strength; the other is the dependence on foreign firms, for example, Africa is one of the main sales markets for Chinese tea, and the export of芜茶(Anhui tea) to Africa is now mostly handled by foreign firms operated by British and French people.

According to statistics on foreign exchange settlement by the Export Promotion Office of the Transportation Control Committee from June 20th to June 26th, based on copies of foreign exchange certificates sent by designated banks, the amount in Shanghai was approximately US$3.76 million. Among them, egg products accounted for approximately US$850,000, pig bristles US$530,000, cotton fabrics US$500,000, tung oil US$470,000, and furs US$230,000. Since the implementation of the new foreign exchange settlement method, as of June 26th, the total export foreign exchange settlement in Shanghai was US$13.44 million.

### Financial Institutions Can Transfer Funds: National Banks Can Accept As Much As Possible

[Our Report] It was recently learned from the National Bank that regarding the method of transferring funds between financial institutions, it has now been approved that, starting from the next business period of this year, all financial institutions, whether national agencies or commercial banks, can entrust this bank to transfer funds from their own branches or agent banks, and this bank can accept as much as possible. There will be no restrictions on any remittance destination. Funds going to Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Fujian and other places can also be accepted directly, without having to be approved by the Business Bureau of this bank first. The remittance fee is temporarily set at 80% of the local bandit rate for remittance areas that are Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and various places in South China (Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces), as well as remittance areas that are North China (Hebei, Chahar, and Rehe provinces). All others are still charged at 60%. If various intermediary banks have difficulties in intermediation due to insufficient paper materials, they can negotiate with the remittance bank to handle the matter. Furthermore, the intermediation of financial institutions' telegraphic transfers should be based on the day after the exchange of funds, and holidays should be excluded. Interest will be paid at the deposit rate if overdue. If the bank has borrowed funds from this bank during the late intermediation period, interest will be paid according to the actual borrowing situation and the borrowing rate, and the payment will be paid by the intermediary bank. However, in the event that local materials are insufficient and the remittance cannot be intermediated and returned, no interest will be paid.

### North China Foreign Exchange Applications to Be Opened

[Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] It is rumored in Shanghai that the Central Bank has decided to open foreign exchange to all places from July 3rd, that is, there will be no more restrictions on the amount of remittances to and from various places. According to the Money and Coin Department of the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank has not discussed the opening of remittance quotas with the Ministry of Finance. However, the application for foreign exchange in North China is scheduled to open on July 1st. The rumor may be a misunderstanding of the application for foreign exchange in North China.

### National Banks Increase Exchange Rates

Another report: After the opening of remittances to South China, the national banks decided yesterday to significantly increase the exchange rates for remittances to various locations, effective July 3rd. It is stipulated that the bank's exchange rates, except for those to South China which are priced at 80% of the fixed price, all other locations will be at 60%.

### Audit Office of National Banks Announces Bank Deposits for May

### Coal Rationing Price for July Increased by 68 Percent

According to Mr. Zhang Xiwei, Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, who told reporters, the price of rationed coal for this (7th) month has been determined by the committee and has increased by approximately 68 percent compared to last month's rationing price. This price has been submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review a few days ago, and will be officially announced as soon as it is approved. Mr. Zhang explained the reason for this significant adjustment in the rationing price, stating that it is mainly due to the rapid increase in the cost of living and the soaring prices of foreign exchange certificates after the implementation of the new import and export foreign exchange settlement method. The cost of importing equipment and materials for various mines and labor costs are increasing daily. If the rationing price is not adjusted reasonably, the production of various coal mines will inevitably come to a standstill.

### Stationery Manufacturers Revise Business Methods

Recently, commodity prices in this city have fluctuated extremely drastically. Stationery manufacturers have stated that the cost of various raw materials used daily is soaring day by day, and there is even a shortage of goods on the market, making production extremely difficult. In order to maintain their capital, they have changed their business methods starting from the 30th. The following five measures have been established:

(1) Before commodity prices stabilize, price increases or decreases will be estimated daily based on raw material price fluctuations and announced on a board; no new price lists or notices will be issued.

(2) Customers must inquire with the manufacturers about the price each day to avoid losses at the time of transaction.

(3) All transactions must be paid in cash; promissory notes will not be accepted. Prices will be calculated according to the current price and no discounts will be given.

(4) For customers in other locations, the price will be settled according to the price on the date the funds are received.

(5) Due to a shortage of raw materials, order acceptance will be temporarily suspended; only small quantities will be supplied to meet retail demand.

### Tight Silver Market at the End of June, Sluggish Cotton Yarn Trading, Cloth Market Either Little Traded or Prices are Firm

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was quiet due to the end of June, with most customers and yarn merchants settling accounts. The initial opening price of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was mediocre, but later, due to the two-day closure, local weaving factories made slight progress, and the price rebounded, eventually closing at 820 million yuan, a decrease of 10 million yuan from the previous day. The market for 21-count Double Horse yarn was also firm but then weakened, resulting in a loss of 30 million yuan, closing at 630 million yuan. The prices of other yarns showed mixed trends of firmness and weakness.

At the beginning of the morning market, Five Blessings fine cloth rose by 300,000 yuan to 20.3 million yuan, with a few transactions.

### Checks Issued by Cooperatives Do Not Have Negotiable Instrument Effect

[Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Finance previously noticed that many credit cooperatives were issuing checks, resulting in many checks with cooperatives as payees circulating on the market. The Ministry of Finance believed that this type of check was in conflict with Article 123 of the Negotiable Instruments Law and ordered a ban on September 26, 1947. Since then, various credit cooperatives have issued statements claiming that issuing checks is actually for the convenience of depositors and is essentially no different from the banking industry. In order to be cautious, the Ministry of Finance specially requested an interpretation from the Judicial Yuan. According to the resolution of the Unified Interpretation of Laws and Regulations Conference of the Judicial Yuan on May 31, checks with cooperatives as payees cannot be issued according to the regulations of the cooperatives. The Judicial Yuan has also ordered the courts in various regions to notify that this type of check does not have the effect of a negotiable instrument, and the Ministry of Social Affairs has telegraphed all credit cooperatives in the country not to issue this type of check again, in violation of laws and regulations. The Ministry of Finance has also instructed the local financial management bureaus to instruct banks and money shops not to accept this type of check.

### Philippine Baseball Champions, the Red Sox, Arrive in Shanghai; Exhibition Match Scheduled Immediately; Chinese Team to Play

[Our Newspaper] The Red Sox team, the champions of the Manila Bay Baseball League in the Philippines, a group of fifteen people, arrived in Shanghai by plane on Tuesday afternoon. They are expected to stay here for a week and play three exhibition games with the maritime strong team.

Game Schedule

July 3rd Saturday

China - Red Sox American Boys School

July 4th

China - Red Sox Racecourse

July 5th

US Armed Forces League - Red Sox Racecourse

The level of baseball in the Philippines is historically high. The skillful skills and impressive record of the Philippine team when they conquered Shanghai before the war can still be remembered by old baseball fans. Since the Red Sox team has won the league title, their strength must be strong. Baseball in Shanghai is still in its infancy, and it may be difficult to compete with them. The lack of ideal talent for pitchers is especially a major problem. Yu Changjian of China is experienced and skilled, but he has not yet reached the peak of perfection. Therefore, there is talk that China will recruit McKinley, a strong man from the Air Force, for the first game. If so, the strength will be greatly enhanced, but it is still difficult to compete with the Philippine veteran Osinin.

The Bank of New York Manila Branch and the American-Philippine Joint Association of this city have each donated a large silver cup to be awarded to the winners of the first two games for commemoration. The presentation ceremony will be held after the game is over.

Also, the Red Sox team originally planned to have a practice match with the Chinese team at the Racecourse at 4:00 pm today to test the venue, but due to rain and wet ground, it may be difficult to hold it according to the original plan.

An Opinion from a Reader

Shen Bao's map is epoch-making in the history of Chinese maps. We might as well say that since the publication of this map, China has had modern maps. This spring, I wrote an article on the publishing industry in the Ta Kung Pao, "Talking about Maps," and especially recommended Shen Bao's topographic map of China. This map is a wall map, divided into four sheets, pieced together into a whole, equivalent to gathering the previously published provincial atlases and hanging them on the wall. The editors were also Mr. Zeng and Mr. Fang. Originally, this map was published in the 28th year of the Republic during wartime, so it was rarely seen in Shanghai (although it was still printed by Yongning Company, renamed from Zhongfeng Bookstore). It was offered for sale at a low price last winter, priced at only 80,000 yuan. By February of this year, it was still 80,000, almost like a gift. Based on that heavy-weight wood-made paper and exquisite index, the market price would be no less than several million yuan! After I wrote this article, I immediately received a letter from Mr. Zeng Shiying in Nanjing, saying that a revised map after the war was being compiled, and hoped that I would contribute my opinions. This kind of humility is truly the demeanor of a scholar. Unfortunately, although I love maps, I am a complete layman in map studies. Even if I wanted to imitate a mountain villager offering his humble gift, I couldn't do it. I feel somewhat ashamed of this to Mr. Zeng. My reply only said that I hoped the new map would be published quickly to meet the needs. And this hope is about to be realized.

Honestly speaking, in terms of topography, there is no big difference between the old map and the new map, unless there are new measurements of longitude and latitude lines and heights. Therefore, the new maps on the market completely copy the old map. As for the newly drawn provinces and regions in the Northeast and the newly added Taiwan Province, they are all taken from Japanese drawings, cut and modified. Some may not have even seen the Japanese things, so there are very few that can satisfy people. Under the Japanese management in the Northeast, the humanistic situation has changed greatly. New railways have been built, and new industrial cities have been developed. If there is no detailed record, it is equivalent to having no map of the Northeast. In the later period, the Japanese devoted great efforts to the mapping of the Northeast, while in the early period, the Japanese even copied from China. That is, Kobayashi Matashichi stole the Northeast part of Shen Bao's New Map of the Republic of China and changed it to the New Measured Map of Manchuria. Kobayashi Matashichi was the printer of China's New World Map. This matter is described in detail in Mr. Zeng's preface to the Topographic Map of the Republic of China. Mr. Zeng's article in the publishing industry of this newspaper mentioned it again the day before yesterday. It is a shame that China has this kind of new map, but it cannot be printed. (Shanghai has copper plate engraving, but only two plates can be produced each year. A large map has fifty or sixty sheets, which will take more than twenty years to complete. It is shocking to say!) When the Japanese army invaded, Kobayashi Matashichi set up branches in Beijing and Shanghai. However, most of the maps he printed were for military use, and outsiders could not peek at them. The maps circulating on the market are not better than those in China. Even the printing paper became extremely shoddy.

Many people are not very clear about the difference between China's New Map and the provincial maps. Originally, the New Map was the official publication celebrating the 60th anniversary of Shen Bao, a huge 1:2,000,000 map that does not follow provincial divisions. It only cuts the country into several units, each unit being a sheet, and each sheet is divided into humanistic and natural maps, each with an index drawn in front, that is, a certain unit is specially printed with oblique lines in the whole map to indicate it. At the back, there is a general index of place names, which is equivalent to a dictionary of place names. When this book was published, it was priced at 25 yuan. If converted according to the price of goods, it should be 50 to 60 million now! It is also because of the readers' purchasing power and the time required for printing that a provincial atlas was compiled for general and student use. The ratio is 1:3,000,000, and the topography and humanities are combined into one, divided into provinces. This is what everyone is used to seeing, and I don't need to say it. As for the topographic map mentioned above, it is specially designed for classroom teaching. It can be said to be perfect in the compilation of topographic maps.

However, people's hearts cannot be satisfied. We who like to read maps are definitely not satisfied with a thin provincial atlas. We are very much looking forward to the re-compilation of China's New Map. Before it is possible to re-compile all of it, it seems to be a good way to first revise and publish the northeastern and southwestern provinces and Taiwan as supplements to those who already have new maps. I don't know what Shen Bao and Mr. Zeng think about this matter? Also, I heard that Da Zhongguo Bookstore, a local company specializing in publishing maps, is already starting to compile a brand new large map, whose size will be comparable to Shen Bao's large map, and will be color-coded by county. This news is very exciting. It seems that due to the guidance of Shen Bao, China also has specialized map-making publishers. However, Shen Bao is still the oldtimer. I have seen the maps published by the American Times and Collier's, and their details are not necessarily as good as those of Shen Bao. As long as things are done by people and are willing to spend money on useful undertakings, there will always be excellent results. We have another proof of this in Shen Bao's map.

### Beggar Daily

— Matsuura

In the suburbs of Vienna, there was a small hotel where a "Beggars Club" was established before World War I. By 1914, the number of members had reached 1,800. Therefore, a "Beggars Daily" was founded, with content about beggars' welfare news, beggars' living conditions, beggars' interesting reading materials, and biographies of great men among beggars. Each copy was sold for half a penny, with a daily circulation of about 4,000 copies. It is said that a Hungarian gentleman with a collecting hobby collected all the "Beggars Daily" and later sold it to the Paris Library for 80 francs.

### Worshipping Wen Tianxiang's Words

— Shi Shufan

Jiangxin Temple in Yongjia is the place where Wenshan crossed the sea south to inspect Wang's oath. After his defeat and martyrdom, the villagers built a temple to commemorate him. The poem says that the water is all around, and two pagodas are inserted in the east and west, where egrets gather, and the wings become snow in the hot summer, which is a spectacle. In the past, I wandered around and paid homage three times. Now it is suddenly possible to look back, and it has been half a century, which is lamentable!

The river flows to the sea and folds back, the mountain势 floats in the air and wants to shake, the twin towers rotate the stars and moon day after day, and the lonely minister looks at the temple cloud tide alone; living to arrange all the tribulations the sky is still attached, and dying for nearly a thousand years the captives are still half defeated; the tail Kuo washes the streets and new dreams pass, and the stone tablet has no tears to the former dynasty.

The layers of the sky remotely control the water and fly high, and the unceasing bells come out from above. It is difficult to dedicate silence to this Jiangcheng. Alas, public body and hands are the most majestic! Whose fault was it that the mountain changed color? The country still praises the loyalty but the tomb has been abandoned. What is the matter of continuing Zhongxing in later generations? It is expected that people and ghosts are both frightened.

Eight years of war alone climbed Deng Lin. Floating Guo car is deep in the desert Han. The sea atmosphere is yellow and the silkworm wheat shadow is broken, and the market lights are red and corroded with the hearts of the people. There is no beef wine to sacrifice in March, but I see rich people waving money, the ancient Buddha does not say that fish and birds are scattered, may they enter the ground and put on their clothes!

Foot stepping on flying dust, temples full of sand, years of wandering as home, people forget the Chai market because of unrighteousness, I will sail to Yongjia, outside the fence, the desolate crows splash ink, the Jiangxin郁 is angry and the waves are blooming, before returning, I can see the shadow of the clothes, a stroke of the sky is clear and the sun is not slanting.

### Graduation and Unemployment

— Pingxi

Recently, I often read appeals and news in the newspaper about the employment problems of this year's summer college graduates. Most of them emphasize that 30,000 to 50,000 young people will move from the campus to society, which is really not easy to arrange. This is usually the case around the summer vacation every year, but this year it seems even more serious. Just like the issuance of legal currency has caused currency flooding and abundant hot money, the expansion of talents makes the phenomenon of overstaffing even more obvious.

If graduation is unemployment, then why waste a few years of studying under the window? But some people also say that even if you don't go to school or graduate, you will mostly be unemployed in this society. A few days ago, there was a publicly funded student from a national school who was willing to stay in school for further studies for fear that there would be no public funds to support him after graduation. The school has simply become a short-term unemployment shelter. If studying is a profession, then graduation is equivalent to dismissal, and the result of graduation is naturally unemployment.

The reason why graduates cannot find jobs is partly because education is divorced from practicality, so others would rather choose someone who has no diploma but has experience to take office, but are unwilling to let scholars come to fill the ranks. In addition, there is another reason, that is, young people often consider themselves extraordinary after obtaining diplomas and degrees, so they have great ambitions and expectations as soon as they leave the thatched cottage. Ordinary positions are not in their eyes, let alone asking them to do labor or farming. The oversupply of intellectuals is really related to their own arrogance.

This is of course a failure of education. How can the "talents" cultivated by universities become an unemployed reserve army! However, the students themselves should also reflect. If you are willing to infiltrate this vast society, you must first abandon the superiority that "literati" often have!

### South Lake Boat Girl

— Ren Xian

People who come to Jiaxing to play will of course go to Nanhu; people who go to Nanhu must also hire a boat. If you are a tourist who has only been there once, I am afraid that few people know that there are various kinds of boats. Because the author is registered in Jiaxing, I know a little about it.

The ordinary boat girls standing near the Dongmen Bridge, who come up to ask "Going to Nanhu?" when foreign guests pass by, are all "old lady boats." The old ladies are about 40 to 50 years old. Their dress is exactly the same as that of rural women, often a blue or white cloth short shirt and black cloth trousers; but they are cleaned up neatly.

Another type is called "girl boat." There is a girl on the boat who does not row the boat, but acts as a receptionist (the word "receptionist" is extracted by me). The rower is still an old lady. The girls call the old ladies "Mma." These girls do not go ashore to solicit customers. Their ages range from seventeen or eighteen to twenty-one or two. People who hire girl boats are of course mostly male guests. Their boat fare is several times higher than that of old lady boats. For example, if it costs 300,000 to 400,000 yuan to hire an old lady boat now, then a girl boat will cost 2 to 3 million. Some guests often bring girls to the "Smoky Rain Tower" to accompany them for a long-distance view, eat tea and snacks, and this girl will think that she is very lucky.

### Green Window Small Talk

— Liuyun

In summer, I like the countryside. The green fields, the shady mountains and forests, the dragonflies skimming the water, the swallows passing through the beams, and the melon racks and bean trellises that are full of poetry and painting... everything shows a kind of serenity, leisure, and tranquility. Du Fu's poem says: "A clear river embraces the village and flows, and everything is secluded in the river village in the long summer." What a lovely picture this is. So I think that summer in the countryside is much more refreshing and organized than the bustling city in the soft red dust.

The most longing for is the daily homework in the flowers of Weng Huayin in West Lake in summer, such as:

"Get up in the morning and wear lotus leaves as clothes, absorb dew by the flower branches to moisten the lungs, and teach parrots poetry. In the middle of the day, casually read a few pages of Lao Zhuang, or spread out the calligraphy posts to write by the pool. In the afternoon, take off the middle stone wall, occupy the frame bed, and talk with friends who have forgotten their shape about the mountains and seas. If you are tired, take the left palace pillow and swim around the country of Hua Xu. In the afternoon, cut the coconut cup, float the melons and sink the plums, and pound the lotus flower to drink Bifang wine. After taking a bath in the orchid soup in the afternoon, steer a small boat and fish by the ancient rattan curved water. At dusk, wearing a bamboo hat and a pu fan, stand on a high hill and watch the gardeners hold pots and water the flowers."

This kind of life is no different from that of a god, it is truly the "idealization" to the extreme. Reading this passage makes people wash away their worldly dust and refresh their muscles and bones. In the meditation with closed eyes, it is as if being in another realm, drifting away and "temporarily forgetting the world here." Sima Qian said: "Although I cannot reach it, my heart yearns for it." I am also the same here.

### Sour Grapes and Ah Q

— Shi Yu

For thirty years, Ah Q has been talked about to the point of being boring. People have given Ah Q the most detailed annual genealogy and examined his life experience; they have also put him on the stage and sent him abroad. Therefore, it seems unnecessary for me to talk about Ah Q again now, repeating the old tune. I remember when Mr. Lu Xun first gave birth to Ah Q, the whole family held this difficult birth and looked at him with every frown and smile with a lot of emotion. But later, the plain boiled water became more and more bland, and the tea leaves became weaker and weaker. Today, when people hear about Ah Q, they at most recall fragments of stories such as "son beating father" or "sleeping with Wu Ma." It is rare for anyone to spend three minutes thinking about it. It is like Granny Liu entering the Grand View Garden for the last time, watching the decline of the Ningrong families, inevitably feeling a little vicissitudes. I watched the decline of Ah Q's status now and in the past, and my eyelashes inevitably moved a little.

People say that Ah Q is not a peony, and it is not a special product of our country. Foreign countries also have people who are good at eating sour grapes or sweet lemons. Sour grapes are a kind of self-justification: people can't eat grapes, so they say the grapes are sour. Sweet lemons are also a kind of self-justification: people have already eaten sour lemons, but they insist that the lemons are sweet. Many people forget Ah Q because they feel that foreign grapes are also sour or lemons are also sweet. Ah Q seems to have been established in our hearts for thirty years, and his negativity, cowardice, and ignorance have been familiar to us for too long, so we cannot see this lover clearly. Officials don't seek efficiency, as long as the breeze comes and the breeze goes, they are considered first-class good officials; soldiers are considered first-class good soldiers as long as they don't desert. Businessmen only seek to make a living; students only need to pass. No one knows whether they eat to live or live to eat.

### Compiling the New Map of China (III)

— Fang Jun

During the Anti-Japanese War, the U.S. 14th Air Force conducted surveying and mapping covering almost half of the country. If one draws a straight line from Tengchong in Yunnan to Chengde in Rehe, the southeastern part of this line was mostly photographed. The Army Map Service used this to produce navigation charts. Their advantage lies in the realism of the terrain. Details such as river meanders, lake shapes, and even the spread of coastal sandbars are all consistent with the recent actual situation. This edition of the new map largely draws upon this source.

During the occupation, the Japanese also compiled 1:50,000 scale maps based on aerial surveys conducted in the areas of Jiangsu and Anhui. The section of the Waibu River south of Shouxian on this map has been improved accordingly. Furthermore, surveying and mapping in Taiwan was largely completed a long time ago. The map used here is the 1:50,000 topographic map reprinted by the United States, and is mostly complete except for the area near Mount Niitaka (Mount Morrison).

Finally, it is necessary to mention the data from the Northwest. The eastern part of Xikang Province is roughly based on the route of Mr. Cui Kexin, the director of the provincial Geological Survey. Mr. Cui spent several years investigating in Kang, and his footprints covered the eastern part of Kang. It is a pity that he was limited by equipment and unable to make altitudinal observations. The northern parts of Qinghai and Xinjiang provinces use Russian maps reprinted by Americans. The scale of this map is 1:1,500,000, and it was published in 1941. The terrain is represented using hatching, with occasional elevation notations. There are also the results of the former Sino-Swedish Scientific Expedition in Xinjiang Province. These were organized in Sweden for nearly ten years and recently published in the United States. According to the plan, there should be thirteen sheets, but only three are available here. The U.S. Army Map Service has also compiled a 1:1,000,000 scale map in the same area, which is also a valuable source.

Regarding the compilation method, first, it is necessary to briefly describe the style and map sheet distribution of the new map. This map includes a general map and fourteen statistical maps, as well as twenty-five provincial maps. The scale of the former is roughly 1:15,000,000.

The latter, except for Mongolia, are all at a scale of 1:3,000,000. Each sheet is based on a province and printed to the edge of the paper. City and other insets are not attached to the map, so that adjacent map sheets can be joined together to form a complete map of any region. To meet this requirement, a single simple projection is not used; each sheet is a part thereof. The projection used in this map is the Lambert Conformal Conic projection, with standard parallels at 24 degrees and 48 degrees North latitude. The biggest drawback of applying this method is that the measurement error in the central part (at 36 degrees North latitude) reaches 2.2%, which means that the length of one kilometer on the ground near this line is 978 meters on the map. This difference in scale is not difficult to calculate using a certain method, and the impact on ordinary map users is extremely small. However, to meet this condition of mutual connectivity, the consumption of labor and paper in the drawing is almost tripled. In the past, the portions outside the province were usually covered with insets, but now the entire area must be drawn, leaving no room for shortcuts.

The back of each map is printed in monochrome with a transportation map of the area, showing every station and mileage of railways and highways, as well as the navigability of rivers.
