### Another Great Victory on the Eastern Section of the Ping Sui Railway: Nie's Bandit Main Force Collapses Across the Board, Corpses Littered Between Juyongguan and Kangzhuang

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 15th] The main force engaged in fierce combat on the eastern section of the Ping Sui Railway, and the National Army has achieved a great victory. The North China剿匪 Headquarters announced: The National Army converged on Qinglongqiao from the north and south on the evening of the 14th and dispatched troops to guard Chadao, Sanbao, Xibozi, and other places. Nie Rongzhen's bandit Second Corps (including the Fourth Column, the Fourth Brigade of the Second Column, the Independent First and Seventh Brigades, and the New Seventh and New Eighth Divisions) threw all their strength into a fierce attack on the above areas. The battle was extremely fierce and fraught with danger. Every hilltop was subjected to a seesaw battle. The fighting continued until 2 p.m. on the 15th, when the bandits collapsed across the board and retreated northeastward. The Fourth Brigade of the Second Column was almost completely annihilated, and other bandit units also suffered extremely heavy casualties in this three-day and three-night battle. The National Army is currently continuing its pursuit.

### Fu Zuoyi Enthusiastically Discusses the Victory

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] After Fu Zong司令 Fu Zuoyi invited reporters from Beiping to Xishan for an autumn outing at the Political Work Department of the 剿匪 Headquarters, he specially hosted a dinner at the headquarters in the western suburbs and announced the news of the National Army's victory on the eastern section of the Ping Sui Railway. Describing the war situation, he said: "There is a very good news, which is the capture and annihilation of the bandit Second Corps with a devastating blow. For several months, the Communist bandits have tried their best to avoid a decisive battle with the main force of the National Army, taking advantage of gaps and harassing everywhere, attempting to achieve their dream of 'the big eating the small.' Therefore, although the National Army has been constantly fighting for several months, it has not been able to capture the main force of the bandits and completely annihilate them. Recently, amid the Communist bandits' so-called 'autumn offensive' clamor, a unit of the North China National Army was transferred to Huludao. At the same time, because Nie Rongzhen's Third Corps and the Red Army of the original Jin Sui Military Region and North Yue Military Region, Yao Zhe, Kang Jianmin, Huang Liqing, Yang Jiarui, etc., and the newly编 Eighth Column colluded and harassed Chahar and Suiyuan, most of the National Army was transferred west. It was at this time that we deliberately exposed a large gap in the eastern section of the Ping Sui Railway. This gap is the throat of transportation between Tianjin and Chahar and Suiyuan and the most dangerous and crucial section of the Pingzhang Railway protecting Beiping, the Guangou section from Juyongguan in the south to Kangzhuang in the north, luring the Communist bandits to take the bait. For this purpose, the National Army withdrew from several county strongholds, and local teams and security forces suffered losses of eight or nine hundred to over a thousand."

"As everyone knows, the terrain in this area is the most dangerous, and the situation is also the most important in military history. The National Army left very little force, and it is mountainous terrain. The Communist bandits have always believed that the mountains belong to them, and the National Army is not accustomed to mountain warfare and needs to fight at night. The Communist bandits believe that night also belongs to them, and the National Army is not good at night warfare. In this area, supplies are extremely inconvenient, and the air force cannot easily scout and assist in the battle. Therefore, the Communist bandits believed that all conditions were favorable to them and unfavorable to the National Army. Thinking this was an excellent opportunity, they sent Nie Rongzhen's main Second Corps, the Second, Third, and Fourth Columns, and the Independent First and Seventh Brigades, as well as the New Seventh and New Eighth Divisions under Zhan Danan, who belonged to the Jicha Rebian District, to take the bait, and they advanced into this area with all their might and occupied the most dangerous commanding heights, Badaling, and the surrounding mountains. When the war progressed to the most tense and highest point, those of us who did not know military matters felt very worried and apprehensive when we heard the news. Of course, we could not lure the bandits if we did not do this, but if we did not use it properly, the future would be unimaginable. Fortunately, a certain military commander personally directed the advance from Nankou to the north, and another military commander acted with great speed and advanced from Kangzhuang to the south. The National Army adapted to the situation, especially our air force comrades, who dispatched day and night to assist in the battle, completing tasks that ordinary people could not complete. The officers and soldiers gave their lives, and their comrades-in-arms were brave and endured hardships. After three days and three nights of seesaw battles, as of 2 p.m. today, the bandits were completely defeated, and the bandit Fourth Brigade and bandits in several areas were completely annihilated, with no one escaping. The bandits' abandoned corpses were scattered throughout the mountains and valleys, and guns and ammunition were abandoned everywhere. A unit of the National Army is currently cleaning up the battlefield, dispatching trucks to transport prisoners, and checking the results of the battle. The main force of the National Army is fiercely and thoroughly pursuing the bandits in the northeast direction. This battle can be said to be the most thrilling and difficult victory, and also the most enjoyable in recent months. I think the bandit army may also know that mountain warfare and night warfare do not belong to them. On the contrary, mountains and nights belong to the National Army."

### The West and East Route Corps in Western Liaoning Are Rushing to Aid Jinzhou; The East Route Reaches Gaoge, and the West Route Captures Taian

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 15th] The National Army's powerful corps are advancing with all speed from the east and west to Jinzhou, the center of the Western Liaoning battlefield. Good news is constantly coming. The West Route National Army, which recaptured Tashan, reached Gaoqiao Station on the 15th and launched an encirclement and suppression of the bandit forces there. The East Route National Army recovered He'an on the morning of the 15th and is currently advancing westward.

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 15th] On the 15th, fires raged in the central urban area of Jinzhou, and battles continued near major strongholds. The old city remained standing, and the National Army held firm. This was the report from aerial reconnaissance in the morning. According to news obtained here, bandits infiltrated the city from the southeast and northwest of the urban area, and street fighting became increasingly fierce, especially in the area south of the railway station and the garrison headquarters. The provincial government on the highlands northwest of the urban area, the railway station in the center of the city, the railway bureau in the eastern part of the city, the Quartermaster General's Office, and the university preparatory class all still saw action on the afternoon of the 15th, proving that the defending army was still fighting bravely. At dawn on the 15th, the aircraft saw both sides engaged in fierce artillery battles. The air force carried out heavy bombing of the bandits' rear units. The bandits used 100,000 troops to attack Jinzhou. A large number were killed or wounded by bombs. Amid the dim twilight of the 15th, the air force made efforts to contact the ground by using the ground fire. The battle in Jinzhou may be slightly intermittent, and the reinforcements from Huludao continue to press toward Gaoqiao. A certain high official here once flew to give instructions. Also, there are signs that bandits in Jinzhou are drawing troops to attack Jinxi.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 15th] On the 15th, our aircraft groups flew in batches to the periphery of Jinzhou to carry out effective bombing of the bandits. The positions 3 kilometers east, west, and northeast of Jinzhou, half a li southeast of the city, and southeast of Beidaying were heavily bombed by our planes, destroying more than a dozen bandit fortifications, and the city defense tended to stabilize. Many bandits were ambushed in the positions on the south side of the river bay east of the railway 3 kilometers east of Tashan. Our planes carried out intensive strafing, killing many bandits. After the bandit positions on the riverside of Liujiatun south of Jinzhou were discovered, 40 bandits were killed.

### The Legislative Yuan Passes a Secret Meeting on Price Review Scheduled for the 18th; The Budget is Passed in the Afternoon, and the Executive Yuan is Urged to Submit it for Review Soon

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 15th] The 11th meeting of the second session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 9:30 a.m. on the 15th. President Sun presided over the meeting. First, five reporting items were passed. The Executive Yuan's request for review of the draft provisional regulations on the monthly salary and public expenses for presidents, vice presidents, appointed, and specially appointed personnel of the Examination Yuan was referred to the Legal System and Budget Committees for joint review in accordance with the opinions of the Procedure Committee. Then, temporary motions were processed. (1) Zhao Hui et al. proposed that the report that the next year's central government general budget would be sent to the Legislative Yuan by the Executive Yuan before the end of November is too inconsistent with the Constitution and the Budget Law and affects the progress of the review work. It is proposed to request the Executive Yuan to send the budget to the Legislative Yuan for review before the end of October as much as possible. The resolution was to send another letter to the Executive Yuan to inquire and ask them to send the draft budget for the next year for review as soon as possible. (2) Zhang Zhijiang et al. proposed that since the currency system reform, prices have risen sharply again recently, and black markets are lurking, resulting in a bad market situation. It is proposed to quickly hold a secret meeting to review prices, thoroughly study methods, so as to stabilize people's livelihood and consolidate the foundation of the country. The resolution was passed, and it was decided to hold a secret meeting on the 18th to review the price issue, and to invite the heads of the Executive Yuan and relevant ministries to attend and report for questioning. (3) Li Feng et al. proposed to request the government to increase the allocation of flour in the three cities of Beiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao, increasing the allocation by 30 jin per person per month, and to open up the north-south grain transport. (4) Li Yaolin et al. proposed to request the Executive Yuan to amend the current method of grain allocation in the five major cities. These two temporary motions are of the same nature as the formal proposal of Li Yu et al., which is listed as a matter for discussion, to propose to improve the urban grain allocation as soon as possible in order to save public funds and maintain the national treasury. Li Yaolin's temporary motion advocated investigating the population, eliminating the fictitious, stopping the allocation of grain to pawnshops and large households, and encouraging grain merchants to purchase, transport, and sell grain in domestic and foreign production areas to regulate surpluses and deficits, which is in line with the measures in Li Yu's case. However, Li Yu and Li Yaolin's two temporary motions advocated increasing the amount of flour allocation in the three cities of Beiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao, which conflicted with the principle of universally reducing the amount of allocation per month in Li Yu's case. After a joint discussion, it was decided to submit it to the Grain Administration Committee for joint review. Then, the discussion items listed on the agenda were started. The first case was proposed by Wu Gan et al., the Act on Promoting Economic Rationalization. After the staff of the Secretariat read the full text of the proposal, the meeting was adjourned as time had run out. The meeting continued at 3:40 p.m. for discussion. More than a dozen committee members put forward oral and written opinions. The members generally agreed with the principles of the case, but put forward amendments to certain clauses and details. Finally, it was passed without objection, and the case was submitted to the Finance and Economics, Economy and Resources, Grain Administration, Land Administration, Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy, Social, and Legal System committees for joint review. The second case was the report of the Procedure Committee on the reorganization of Jin Shaoxian et al.'s proposal to clarify the administrative situation of the Executive Yuan and its ministries and committees as a basis for the decisions of the Legislative Yuan. It is proposed to request the Executive Yuan and to order the ministries and committees to submit periodic reports on the administrative situation to the Legislative Yuan during this session in order to conform to the spirit of the Constitution. After Cheng Tianfang, a member of the Procedure Committee, explained it, the "Measures of the Legislative Yuan for Periodically Hearing the Executive Yuan's Administrative Reports and Questioning" were discussed. However, it was already past 6 p.m. after it had just begun, and most committee members advocated postponing the discussion to the next meeting, so the meeting was adjourned.

### Ensuring a Sound Organization for Issuance Reserve Supervision and Administration; Enhancing People's Confidence in the Gold Yuan; Control Yuan's Finance and Food Committee Submits Another Corrective Proposal Regarding Candidates for the Supervisory Committee

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The Control Yuan believes that the candidates for the Gold Yuan Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee do not adequately represent the people of the entire nation. Previously, the Finance and Food Committee of the Yuan submitted a corrective proposal, which was forwarded to the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan has already responded, but the Finance and Food Committee believes that the Executive Yuan's response does not align with the intent of the corrective proposal. It decided to submit another corrective proposal during a meeting held on the 15th. It is reported that the Executive Yuan's response stated, "The sole task of the Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee is to inspect, safeguard, and announce the issuance reserves to demonstrate trustworthiness. Moreover, inspection, safeguarding, and other matters largely involve specialized techniques. It seems more reasonable to select committee members who are familiar with or close to financial and accounting operations. The committee members are all chairmen of national commercial banking and accounting organizations, which aligns with your Yuan's views." The Control Yuan's Finance and Food Committee's second corrective proposal states: "The amount of Gold Yuan issued and whether the reserves are sufficient are deeply related to the national finances and the interests of the people. China has a vast territory. To ensure that the people of the entire nation can understand the actual situation of the new currency issuance and reserves, and to further strengthen their confidence in the new currency, the candidates for the Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee should be selected with attention to including those who represent the majority of people from various regions and groups across the country to demonstrate trustworthiness. Article 10 of the Gold Yuan Issuance Regulations does not stipulate that committee members must be government agencies and financial representatives. The Gold Yuan Issuance Reserve Supervisory Committee Organizational Regulations established by the Executive Yuan are unilateral decrees of the Executive Yuan, which have not undergone legislative procedures and are not laws. They can be amended at its discretion in consideration of legal principles and factual circumstances. The inspection and safekeeping matters mostly involve specialized techniques, and Article 3 of the Organizational Regulations has already stipulated the establishment of four to eight auditors to handle review, accounting, and report preparation matters. Item 6 stipulates that staff are all seconded from the Ministry of Finance, the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and the Central Bank. Technical matters are already the responsibility of dedicated personnel, so this cannot be used as a reason. Furthermore, the originally appointed committee members, in terms of region, are only from Shanghai; in terms of the professional organizations represented, only commercial banking and accounting organizations are represented. Not a single person from farmers' associations and labor unions, which constitute the vast majority of the national population, has been selected. To say that this can represent the whole country is a distortion. Therefore, to improve the supervisory organization and enhance the people's confidence, another corrective proposal is submitted, requesting prompt and reasonable improvements to demonstrate trustworthiness."

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The Control Yuan's Finance and Food Committee passed the proposal of the Fujian-Taiwan District Supervisory Committee Office on the 15th and submitted a corrective proposal regarding the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, a state-run enterprise, for excessively occupying land, oppressing the people, and having a large organization that wastes national funds.

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] The Control Yuan's investigation of salt administration has recently come to an end. Control Yuan members Zhang Dinghua, Wang Xiangchen, and Liu Xingzhi have conducted separate on-the-ground investigations for more than a month and have separately drafted corrective and impeachment proposals regarding matters that should be promoted and reformed in salt administration, and submitted them to the Control Yuan. On the afternoon of the 15th, the Yuan's Finance and Food Committee passed two corrective proposals jointly submitted by members Zhang Dinghua and Wang Xiangchen: (1) a corrective proposal regarding the accumulated malpractices in salt administration, and (2) a corrective proposal regarding the Salt Administration Bureau's handling of employee welfare programs. The full text of both formal proposals will be released by the Control Yuan within days. It is reported that the main points of the salt administration malpractice case are: 1. There are two illegal surcharges in addition to the regular tax: (1) the business transportation salt tax protection fee, and (2) the recorded tax, the commercial salt tax loss reserve fund. 2. The turnover of annual salt is inappropriate. 3. Amortization and depreciation are illegal. 4. Auditing and accounting fees are ineffective in salt administration agencies. 5. There are easy opportunities for corruption in transportation and pricing. 6. Administrative expenses are excessive.

### Can the United Nations Solve the Berlin Problem?

The United Nations Security Council, in order to break the deadlock, moved the Berlin problem to behind-the-scenes negotiations and adjourned for a week. It resumed debate on the Berlin problem on the 15th. During the week-long adjournment, representatives of the six neutral countries made great efforts to mediate, hoping to resolve the Berlin crisis peacefully; however, the result was not only a failure to break the deadlock of the Berlin event, but also a hardening of attitudes on both sides. The Western allies insisted on the principle of lifting the blockade before negotiations, while the Soviet Union demanded that the Berlin problem be removed from the Security Council's agenda before negotiations to resolve the Berlin crisis. With neither side willing to yield, the matter could only be settled in the Security Council. Representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France held a meeting on the 14th to discuss the resolution to be submitted to the Security Council, seemingly to compel the Security Council to take action within a few days. Even if the Soviet Union does not withdraw from the United Nations, it will undoubtedly exercise its veto power in the Security Council, preventing the Security Council from passing any resolution. Therefore, whether the Security Council can solve this thorny problem has become the focus of world attention at the United Nations General Assembly in Paris.

Since October 4, the Security Council has been dealing with the complaint of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France against the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin. The world is worried about whether the United Nations can pass this serious test. Initially, Soviet representative Vyshinsky opposed placing the Berlin issue on the Security Council's agenda on the grounds that "the United Nations' discussion of the Berlin event violates the Potsdam Agreement." Later, the Security Council disregarded the Soviet representative's opposition and passed the motion to place the Berlin event on the agenda. The Soviet representative then announced that it would never participate in this discussion, and the Ukrainian representative also stated that it would stand with the Soviet representative, leaving the Security Council in a difficult predicament. However, for the sake of breaking the deadlock on the Berlin problem, and also for the sake of the future of the United Nations, the six neutral countries in the Security Council unanimously advocated that the Security Council temporarily adjourn and move the Berlin problem to behind-the-scenes discussions, so that representatives of the neutral countries could contact each other outside the meeting to find a compromise solution, so as to peacefully resolve the Berlin problem and also spare the Security Council this serious test. Therefore, during the seven days of the Security Council's adjournment, the hope of compromise was never extinguished, and the call for resuming peace talks was loud. The neutral countries suggested "lifting the blockade of Berlin on the one hand and conducting negotiations between the four powers on the other," which was likely to be accepted by both sides. However, after the four powers' diplomats circled around Paris several times, all hopes returned to disillusionment. When U.S. Secretary of State Marshall returned to the United States to report on his duties and returned to Paris, the Western allies decided to abandon their attempts to compromise with the Soviet Union and compel the Security Council to take action on the Berlin issue, forcing representatives of the six neutral countries to abandon their plans to mediate the Berlin problem. The Security Council resumed its meeting on the 15th and naturally had to deal with this most thorny issue according to its scheduled agenda.

According to the speculation of well-informed diplomatic sources, the Western countries and the Soviet Union will take the following three steps in a showdown: (1) In the Security Council, they will accuse the Soviet Union of blockading Berlin, which is enough to threaten world peace. Although they know that the Soviet representative will exercise his veto power, they will still force the Security Council to express itself. (2) In the United Nations General Assembly, the British representative will be the first to speak, condemning the Soviet Union for plunging the post-war world into a state of turmoil, and pointing out that the Soviet Union's proposal for world disarmament and a one-third reduction in each country's military is also insincere. (3) In the United Nations General Assembly, with the support of an overwhelming majority, the atomic energy control plan proposed by the United States will be passed, and the Soviet Union will be declared the only obstacle to the establishment of an atomic energy control system. If things really develop like this, it will inevitably lead to the Soviet Union's withdrawal from the United Nations, which will still have no practical effect on the resolution of the Berlin problem, and will only create a breakdown of the United Nations organization. This really makes us feel infinitely anxious about the future of the United Nations!

Purely from a legal point of view, it is not objectionable for the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to appeal to the Security Council on the Berlin issue, mainly to test the actual effectiveness of the United Nations organization. However, according to the characteristics of the United Nations organization, its foundation is entirely built on international solidarity and cooperation. Problems can only be resolved peacefully under the premise that the great powers have the same opinions. Otherwise, if the great powers have different opinions, as long as one country expresses disagreement, whether it exercises its veto power or withdraws from the United Nations organization, it can promote the disintegration of the United Nations organization and further demonstrate the division of the world. Therefore, all those who truly love the United Nations do not agree to handing over any disputes between the great powers to the United Nations for handling. Even with regard to the Berlin problem, under the circumstances that the Eastern and Western blocs are moving towards extremes, no matter what action the Security Council takes, it will not be able to resolve the Berlin crisis, but will cause difficulties for the United Nations, and its weaknesses will be exposed without a doubt, merely shattering humanity's only hope for world peace. How unwise is this!

In today's world where people yearn for peace, everyone must be patient, seek understanding from mutual recognition, and seek common ground in understanding. This is the true way to love the United Nations. Otherwise, if each goes to extremes and is willing to embark on the road of division, the United Nations will also lose its meaning of representing the whole world and will encounter the same fate as the old League of Nations.

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] According to the Grain News Agency: Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan, in view of the fact that the local governments in most grain-producing areas have independently promulgated laws and regulations prohibiting the export of grain, which has greatly affected the central government's unified planning for military supplies and civilian grain, specially issued an order on the 15th to the heads of all provinces and cities, instructing them to promptly order their jurisdictions to strictly prohibit the obstruction of grain transportation and the interception and purchase of grain along the way.

[Our Nanjing Office, 15th] Information from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce: The French Economic Delegation in China previously sent a letter suggesting Sino-French barter trade. The scope of goods listed was very broad, and the total amount of barter trade was worth USD 27.6 million. After consultation with relevant units such as the Export Control Commission, the China Trust Bureau, the Qi Commission, and International Trade, the following two principles were formulated: (1) For commodities that can be exchanged for foreign exchange, the method of selling for cash should be adopted as much as possible to promote sales abroad. If sales are difficult or sales prices are excessively loss-making, the method of barter trade will be adopted after considering the situation. (2) For materials exchanged through barter trade, selections will be made according to domestic needs and in consideration of international market prices. The Export Control Commission will invite representatives from the Central Bank, the Trust Bureau, and the French side to consult and determine the following barter trade principles: (1) The transaction amount is set at USD 500,000. (2) The barter trade term is temporarily set at half a year. (3) The types of barter trade are temporarily set as cigarette paper (worth approximately USD 200,000) and pigments or caustic soda (worth approximately USD 300,000) for import, and green tea or other export materials for export. (4) The detailed measures will be negotiated by the China Trust Bureau and the French representatives. It is heard that the French government may agree to these principles, and the relevant authorities in our country have prepared documents to submit to the Executive Yuan for approval, and the China Trust Bureau will negotiate a contract with the delegation.

### All Those Disrupting the Financial Market Will Be Punished With the Death Penalty; Guangzhou Economic Supervision Office Holds Emergency Meeting to Decide

[Our Guangzhou Office, 15th] The Guangzhou Economic Supervision Office held an emergency meeting to discuss issues such as preventing the black market and supplying materials in response to recent drastic market fluctuations. The meeting resolved to punish all those disrupting the financial market with the death penalty and to increase the quantity of rice rations sold.

### Ningbo Officials and Merchants Collude; Smuggling Food Rice Exposed

[Our Ningbo Office, 15th] Amidst the restrictions on the export of rice, an incident of grain merchants colluding with grain officials to forge documents to transport rice out of the territory occurred in this port. Chen Yunshui, a grain merchant from Yuyao, held a transportation certificate issued by the local Land and Grain Office, stating that the amount was 200 shi, requesting the Sixth Branch of the Yin Police Bureau to release it. The police saw that his actions were suspicious and immediately telegraphed the Land and Grain Office to inquire. They claimed that the transportation certificate was only issued up to No. 324, but the one held by the merchant was No. 329, which was obviously a fraud. They asked Director Fu to detain him. After a rigorous interrogation, they learned that it was handled by Zhang Hanfu, a staff member who had left his job, and Zhang obtained it from Shen Yannian, a staff member of the Land and Grain Office in charge of Civil Mediation Committee affairs.

### Establishment of the Anthracite Regulation Committee: Responsible for Coal Pricing and Allocation, While Supply and Sales are Handled by Individual Mines

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] The Anthracite Regulation Committee held its inaugural meeting at 10:00 AM on the 15th at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Qitian presided over the meeting. Attendees included Sun Yueqi, Chairman of the National Resources Commission; Zhang Zizhu, Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce; Cai Wenzhao, Director of the Fourth Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense; Zhao Chuanyun, Assistant Director of the Road Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications; and Chen Shuzeng, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank. Sun Yueqi was immediately elected as Chairman and Zhang Zizhu as Vice Chairman. The committee was jointly established by the aforementioned relevant agencies in accordance with the spirit of the Legislative Yuan's resolution and the measures agreed upon by the Executive Yuan. Its responsibilities include: (1) price verification, (2) allocation, (3) maintaining safe coal reserves, and (4) allocating and selling coal to public servants and educators. Its nature is purely a design, policy-making, supervision, and coordination body. Coal supply and sales operations are entirely the responsibility of the mine operators themselves. Therefore, it is distinctly different from the previous Coal Management Committee and the Anthracite Supply and Distribution Office. Its organization is also highly streamlined. The committee internally is divided into only two groups: General Affairs and Investigation, with a total staff of only 20 people, primarily on temporary assignment. Staff from the former Coal Management Committee and Coal Supply Office will be dismissed entirely. The committee is scheduled to hold its second meeting on the 18th of this month to actively plan for implementation. At a time when the emergency decree on financial and economic measures is being strengthened, anthracite coal is impacted by industrial costs and land and water transport prices. Its availability or scarcity is closely related to public utilities, railway transport, and industrial production. With the approaching winter season, there is concern about coal shortages. It is impossible to allow freedom and especially important to make timely plans and full preparations to assist in suppressing the rebellion and stabilizing the people's livelihood.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] Regarding the future anthracite coal supply, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the National Resources Commission convened a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 15th at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, inviting responsible individuals from Kailuan, Huadong, Huainan, and Taiwan mines to discuss the issue. The meeting was presided over by Chen Qitian. After an exchange of views, the following points were decided: (1) The Anthracite Regulation Committee is responsible for coal pricing and allocation, while coal supply and sales are the responsibility of the individual mines themselves. (2) Each mine should establish a joint supply office or acting sales office for supplying anthracite coal, to be established by the 25th. (3) The supply of anthracite coal to the public by each mine will commence on November 1st. The existing agencies will remain responsible for maintaining operations during the current month. (4) The measures for each mine's supply of anthracite coal will be drafted by the responsible individuals of each mine at a meeting on the 16th and submitted for discussion at the second meeting of the Anthracite Regulation Committee on the 18th. (5) The Anthracite Regulation Committee will establish an office in both Nanjing and Shanghai, responsible for coal price review and coal allocation matters. Both offices are scheduled to be established by the 25th. Furthermore, a detailed discussion was held at the meeting regarding augmenting current coal sources. According to attendees, due to military reasons, coal sources are sometimes not very smooth, but there is no widespread shortage expected in anthracite coal supply.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 15th] Liang Yingwen, Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 15th at the Executive Yuan with representatives from the Ministries of Industry and Commerce, Communications, National Defense, and Finance, as well as the National Resources Commission, to review the "Organizational Regulations of the Anthracite Regulation Committee" and the "Anthracite Supply Measures."

### The Four Powers Should Break the Berlin Problem Stalemate with a Spirit of Tolerance and Understanding: Representatives of Neutral Countries Issue a Joint Appeal; Soviets Still Insist the Security Council has No Right to Consult

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 15th Broadcast: The Security Council held a meeting at 3:17 PM (World Standard Time) on the 15th to seek a solution to break the Berlin problem stalemate. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky and Ukrainian Representative Manuilsky both attended, with the entire Soviet delegation participating. Vyshinsky carried a large briefcase of documents. After the failure of the six neutral countries' efforts to seek a compromise solution, the debate on the Berlin problem resumed. The United States, Britain, and France had accused the Soviet Union of blockading Berlin, endangering peace. The Soviet Union insisted that the Security Council had no right to consult and that only the foreign ministers of the four occupying powers could handle the German issue. Argentinian Representative Bramuglia, Acting President of the Security Council, called for resolving the Berlin issue with an attitude of "tolerance and understanding." He said that all people who hope for peace are focused on the Security Council. He said the characteristics of the modern era are "revolution, war, and barbaric acts." He stated, "Gentlemen, know that we still have fifty years to live before this terrible century passes."

[United Press, Rome/Paris, 15th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky has been resisting since the Security Council began considering the Berlin crisis. On the 15th, he made an unprecedented announcement in the Security Council that the Soviet Union would not answer any questions related to Berlin raised by the Council.

[Our Dispatch] Paris, 15th Broadcast: The Security Council's "neutral" countries appealed to the four powers on the 15th to try to resolve their Berlin dispute in a peaceful "private" manner, and issued a warning that if the four powers cannot resolve it as soon as possible, war will break out sooner or later. The Security Council formally requested the four powers to submit a detailed report on the breakdown of the Berlin negotiations and stated that it had no intention of forcing a rapid showdown on the case, as the Western allies hoped.

[United Press, Paris, 15th] The Western countries on the 15th again launched an attack on the Soviet Union in the Security Council. At the same time, all indications are that the heated debate on the Berlin crisis will drag on for the entire week. It is expected that when the Berlin case comes to an end next weekend, Soviet Representative Vyshinsky will veto all motions, and the West will then likely turn to the UN General Assembly to attack the Soviet Union. The Security Council was convened by Argentinian Representative Bramuglia, President of the Security Council, after a nine-day recess. The first priority on the 15th was for the so-called "neutral" countries to thoroughly review the opinions of the Western three powers and the Soviet Union. It is understood that the West is determined to have the majority of the Security Council pass a resolution that the Soviet Union is the aggressor in the Berlin dispute and thus a threat to world peace. Reliable sources say that the Western countries have already abandoned all hope of an early lifting of the Berlin blockade within 24 hours. They say the West is prepared to maintain the airlift to Berlin for the entire winter. Under the guidance of President Bramuglia, representatives of the six "neutral" countries have prepared a questionnaire to be submitted to the Soviet Union and the West at the meeting on the 15th. If they can induce Vyshinsky to answer the questions, his sit-down strike will be broken.

### Hoping the UN General Assembly Will Seek a Solution: Building Lasting Peace in the Holy Land; Bunche Issues an Appeal at the Political Committee

[United Press, Paris, 15th] The UN General Assembly's Political Committee met at 10:00 AM this morning to discuss the Palestine issue. Belgian Representative Spaak presided, and representatives of Transjordan and Israel were allowed to participate but without voting rights. Acting Mediator Bunche warned that the armistice in the Holy Land cannot last and called for the early conclusion of a formal peace treaty or at least a truce agreement. Bunche provided a preliminary report to the Political Committee, unconditionally endorsing the final recommendations of the late mediator Bernadotte.

He also mercilessly condemned the Jewish murderers' assassination of Bernadotte as extremely despicable. Bunche believes that if the UN General Assembly can put forward a reasonable general solution, it is hoped that both the Arab and Jewish sides can agree. He stated that although the two sides have deep-seated grievances, they both hope for peace, as the cost of war is too great and hinders the normal development of both societies. He said that the UN General Assembly should express its views on fundamental issues such as the Jewish state, its borders, international guarantees of the rights of residents in Palestine, Arab refugees, and the United Nations' continued attention to the Holy Land. However, a detailed blueprint is not necessary. The UN General Assembly should allow both parties to resolve the details themselves on major matters based on the UN General Assembly's decisions. Bunche also quoted Bernadotte's appeal to replace the truce agreement with a substantive solution, saying that once the war restarts, the consequences will be disastrous, threatening not only the Middle East but also world peace. Mr. Bunche warned all countries to recognize the existence of the Jewish state. After Bunche finished speaking, the Arab representatives launched an attack. The Syrian representative accused Israel of being responsible for Bernadotte's assassination. Finally, Israeli Representative Eban announced that Foreign Minister Shertok will make a detailed statement next week explaining why his country opposes Bernadotte's solution and will report to the Security Council on the investigation details of Bernadotte's murder. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM, with the date of the next meeting to be determined.

### US Cannot Accept Soviet Disarmament Proposal

[United Press, Paris, 15th] US Representative Osborn stated at the UN General Assembly's Political Committee debate on the East-West split on the 15th, "The question is, after the war, we have laid down our weapons, while a certain country has expanded its territory?" He criticized the Soviet Union's disarmament proposal, believing that it was not genuine and did not guarantee an explanation of the term "troops." In fact, the Soviet Union does not want other countries to know whether it is reducing its annual quota. Mr. Osborn, an atomic energy expert, has repeatedly debated this issue with the Soviet side for months. The United Kingdom and the United States have adopted a new stance, believing that opposing disarmament does not violate morality.

[United Press, Paris, 15th] The United States rejected the Soviet Union's disarmament plan on the 15th, believing it to be "completely unacceptable" unless the Soviet Union "opens the Iron Curtain" and withdraws its worldwide fifth column. The United Kingdom condemned the Soviet Union for mistreating its own people and maintaining a large-scale "slave system" as "unparalleled in the world."

### Wang Shijie Says in Germany that War or Peace Will Be Decided Next Year: Impressed by the Berlin Airlift

[Central News Agency, Frankfurt, 14th, United Press] Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie recently stated, "We can be sure that the threat of war will still require another year." Wang came here to exchange views with US military government German director Clay. Wang predicted that 1949 will be a decisive year in terms of war. Wang met with reporters at a magnificent building used to host Wang by the US military and said: "I do not believe that war is imminent. 1949 may be the year to decide war or peace." He said that one of the purposes of his visit was to observe the Berlin airlift. Wang said after inspecting an airfield that he was deeply impressed by the size of the airfield and that the American airlift was even better than he had expected. Wang said that the difficulties of flying over the Hump during the war were greater than those you are experiencing today, but the number of American planes at that time could not be compared with the number of planes that the American authorities here can use.

### Three Major Parties Refuse to Cooperate with Yoshida: The New Cabinet is Unlikely to Last; Yoshida Announces a New Cabinet Can Be Expected Within Three Days

[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] Yoshida Shigeru paid a visit to Emperor Hirohito on the 15th and held an inauguration ceremony, assuming the post of Japan's sixth Prime Minister after the war. He also plans to pay a courtesy visit to MacArthur on the evening of the 15th. Yoshida immediately began forming a cabinet after being elected Prime Minister on the 14th.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] Two hours after taking office as Prime Minister, Yoshida Shigeru announced that the cabinet could be formed in two or three days and that he would engage in reform movements in political and financial aspects. Yoshida said: "I intend to organize a clean and capable cabinet." Yoshida said: "I will select ministers from people without blemish. The Democratic Liberal Party's policy will not change. Yoshida also said that he will fully support the policies of the Allied Headquarters. Yoshida had a long talk with the Emperor this afternoon and took office at 2:30 PM. The Social Democratic Party recently stated that the Yoshida cabinet is a typical conservative cabinet, extremely reactionary, and the party cannot cooperate with such a government. The Democratic Party and the National Cooperative Party also simultaneously announced that they are opposition parties and will never participate in the Yoshida cabinet.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] The headquarters for the formation of the new cabinet of Japan's new Prime Minister Yoshida has now moved into the Prime Minister's official residence and has begun the work of forming a cabinet in a tense atmosphere.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] The new cabinet of Prime Minister Yoshida may not last more than two months because the results of last night's parliamentary vote showed that Yoshida cannot grasp the majority support of the Japanese Parliament. Yoshida may face a hostile parliament. Parliament can end the life of the new cabinet at any time. Moreover, the three parties that had previously participated in the government and still hold a majority in the meeting (the Social Democratic Party, the Democratic Party, and the National Cooperative Party) all cast votes of non-cooperation in last night's vote. Since Yoshida did not obtain the cooperation of the other two major parties, he may form a one-party government, but he may still try to recruit one or two people from non-partisans and the Social Reform Party, because Yoshida did receive their twenty votes. Political figures expect that it will not be easy for Yoshida to recruit enough political talent to fill his sixteen cabinet positions.

The delegation is closely watching Yoshida Shigeru's cabinet formation and expects the cabinet to be of a one-party autocratic nature.

### US Military Government Spokesman in Germany Says the Soviets Will Not Launch a War: Soviet Ground Forces in Austria Hold Large-Scale Exercises

[United Press, New York, 15th] Brat, former official spokesperson for the US military government in Berlin, severely criticized the report of former military government official Grasu on the 15th, with Mr. Grasu believing that the Soviet Union might be willing to launch a war to seize Berlin. Mr. Brat said in a broadcast, "War will definitely not break out in Germany now, for two reasons: first, US Commander Clay is doing his best to avoid a face-to-face contest and all accidents that may cause face-to-face contests; the other is that the Soviet Union cannot win in war at this time. Transportation is necessary in modern warfare, but we know that the Soviet Union has dismantled all the double-track railways in East Germany and converted them into other facilities."

[United Press, Vienna, 14th] Authoritative officials here said on the 14th that 90 heavy tanks had arrived in Austria from Hungary to participate in Soviet army exercises in Duprechtsden. Duprechtsden is 45 miles northwest of Vienna. They said that about 23,000 to 30,000 Soviet troops stationed in Hungary and Austria will participate in the exercises at the former German Hammelburg base in Duprechtsden.

According to reports, at the afternoon meeting of the National Assembly on the 13th, someone proposed requiring foreign troops to withdraw from Korea. Mr. Rhee said: "The National Assembly voted at that time to retain the motion by a vote of 68 to 10. There are no more problems after that." He also said: "In our National Assembly, just like the parliaments of other countries, there are some troublemakers who, under the instigation of external forces, try to express their opposition to the government whenever possible."

### US Strengthens Far East Defense: Pacific Supreme Military Conference Held in Crystal, Alaska to Hold Air Force Exercises Next Month

[United Press, Tokyo, 15th] Reliable military sources said on the 15th that the high-level defense conference of commanders of the Far East, Alaska, and the Pacific region held here this week should not be regarded as evidence that the US base is advancing to this defense line due to increased threats. In recent weeks, it has been widely rumored that the Soviet Union will adopt a strategy of attacking the US mainland from the northwest, making the situation increasingly serious, but he dismissed this fear as nonsense. He said: "Military commanders must assume any possible attack is coming. In the midst of the tense world situation, overseas commanders will hold more meetings to discuss coordination plans." A spokesperson for MacArthur's headquarters said: "We do not intend to publicly announce the issues and decisions discussed at the meeting." According to reports, the conference was held here for four days, with the participants including Lieutenant General Kunninh, Joint Commander of the Alaskan Defense Forces, Vice Admiral McCrea, Deputy Commander of the US Pacific Fleet, General MacArthur, and their staff. Lieutenant General Kunninh returned to Alaska on the 14th, and Vice Admiral McCrea continued his journey from Pearl Harbor to Qingdao, China, where the headquarters of the US Western Pacific Fleet is located. This conference was the first face-to-face meeting between the three supreme defense commanders of the Pacific since the establishment of the unified command system of the three overseas armies 22 months ago.

[United Press, Washington, 14th] The US Air Force announced on the 14th that five B-50 Superfortresses will fly to Alaska in three groups of five each for 45 days of exploratory training, starting on November 1st.

US military leaders are seeking measures to connect Japan and the Far East. According to the US military here, the strength of US troops in the above areas is weak, and they may not be able to resist. Another report: It is widely rumored in the US military that a separate military region will be established in the northwest region of the US mainland.

### New Defense Line in Tokyo Meeting Does Not Include China; Shang Zhen Announces in Japan

[Central News Agency Tokyo 15th] Shang Zhen, head of our delegation to Japan, announced today: The major defense line recently decided upon at the high-level US military conference in Tokyo, extending from Alaska through Japan, Okinawa, to the Philippines, clearly does not include China. He neither participated in nor is aware of the details of this US military conference. The British occupation forces were also not consulted by the US, so the defense plans formulated by the US military authorities are purely a US matter. According to well-informed sources: The British occupation authorities were invited to participate in the meeting, but the British commander, Robertson, declined to announce his participation in the meeting. Senior officials from the US Army, Navy, and Air Force met in Tokyo to formulate a defense line against surprise attacks. It is said that the main agenda of the meeting was the liaison between the Army, Navy, and Air Force in the four military districts in case of emergency, to prevent a recurrence of the Pearl Harbor tragedy. According to the US plan, the defense line is clearly established outside the Asian continent. The defense conference has intensified the US military in Japan's preparations for the defense of Japan, reaching its climax.

### The Sugar Black Market; The Guild Should Be Responsible; The Director and Secretary Have Been Detained; Supervisor Jiang Believes It Is Due to Artificial Manipulation

[This Newspaper] At 5:45 PM yesterday, the Supervisor's Office ordered the detention of Zheng Yizhou, the director of the Taibei City Sugar Guild, and Zhu Guoming, the guild's secretary. The reason is that the sugar black market has been rampant in recent months, far exceeding the price limit, making it difficult for citizens to purchase sugar. Supervisor Jiang was furious upon hearing this, believing that sugar is the commodity least likely to have a black market, as Taiwan Sugar Corporation regularly distributes large quantities of sugar. The fact that the black market is rampant today clearly indicates artificial manipulation. Therefore, he summoned Zheng Yizhou to the office for questioning yesterday afternoon and severely reprimanded him. At 5:45 PM, Cheng Yi-kuan was ordered to direct the police to detain Zheng and Zhu.

Before being detained, Zheng Yizhou stated that the sugar handled by the Sugar Guild was only part of the total, not all of it, and that most of the wholesalers' sugar had also been allocated to customers. Recently, 4,200 bags and 760 bags were allocated to the Southern Goods Guild and the Biscuit Industry, respectively. He has little stock on hand and cannot be held responsible for the black market.

### Second Registration of Seven Daily Necessities to Start Today; The Supervisory Office Instructs All Industries; Existing Stocks Should Be Supplied as Much as Possible

[This Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau will begin the second registration of existing stocks today, designating seven items: sugar (including all varieties), soap (including household, industrial, and all other varieties), wool yarn, kerosene (including domestically refined kerosene), charcoal, matches (including all varieties), and yellow ox. Using today's inventory as the standard, all companies, firms, factories, cooperatives, and material agencies in the city that have the above items in stock and have joined the relevant trade association must report to the Social Affairs Bureau in triplicate according to the form provided by the trade association. Those who have not joined a trade association should send the form directly to the Second Section of the Social Affairs Bureau. The deadline for registration is October 23. Those who fail to report or conceal their inventory will be severely punished according to the law once discovered.

The Shanghai District Economic Control Supervisory Office believes that the purpose of this general registration of major daily necessities in the city is to prevent hoarding by unscrupulous merchants and to understand the inventory of various manufacturers. Recently, some merchants have mistakenly believed that the registered goods have been recognized by the government and can be held for speculation, unwilling to sell them on the market, which defeats the purpose of the general registration. In addition, it has been found that goods manufactured by various manufacturers are often secretly stored in warehouses and are unwilling to be supplied to the market, resulting in market shortages and seriously affecting people's lives. The Supervisory Office has specially requested the Municipal Government to strictly order all manufacturers to supply the registered goods and manufactured goods to the market as much as possible to stabilize the market. After receiving the order, the Social Affairs Bureau has instructed all industries to comply.

### Seven More Fashion Shoe Stores Found to Be Raising Prices

In addition to exceeding the price limit, Jindou Shoe Store was also hiding embroidered women's shoes and refusing to sell them, which is suspected of hoarding for speculation. The manager of the store, Jia Juesheng, is a director of the Shoe Guild and has been summoned by the police for questioning. In addition, Gao Hanzhang, the person in charge of Daxinchang Cotton Cloth Store at 257 Tongfu Road, was taken to the police station and released on bail after being reprimanded for not selling cloth according to regulations.

### First Batch of Imported Penicillin to Arrive in Port Within Days

[This Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Drug Adjustment and Supply Temporary Committee, in order to alleviate the drug shortage in the city, extracted 80,000 US dollars from the city's drug import quota to purchase important medicines such as penicillin from abroad. It is now learned that the first batch of these drugs will arrive in port within ten days, including 60,000 ampoules of penicillin and several thousand ampoules of streptomycin, which will be fully distributed to patients.

### Wan Molin and Others Summoned for Questioning; Secret Report Lacks Concrete Facts

[This Newspaper] Wan Molin, the chairman of the Rice Guild, Rong Hongyuan, the general manager of Shenxin Textile Company, and Huang Yicong, the manager of Yongtaihe Tobacco Company, were secretly reported to the Economic Supervisor's Office for allegedly being traitors and hoarding for speculation. The Economic Supervisor's Office sent the case to the Special Criminal Court for investigation. The court opened yesterday morning. Wan Molin reported at 9:00 AM. Rong and Huang were in custody for another case and were brought in from the detention center for questioning. At around 9:00 AM, Prosecutor Li Yulong took the stand to question them. Wan presented the Victory Medal and a certificate of martyrdom to prove that he was not a traitor. Prosecutor Li immediately stated that treason cases were not under the jurisdiction of the court and only the hoarding and speculation part would be investigated. He then questioned Wan in detail about the supply and marketing of rice in the city. Wan, Rong, and Huang all denied having engaged in hoarding and speculation. Because the secret report did not provide concrete facts, the investigation was very difficult. After the hearing, Wan Molin was dismissed, and Rong and Huang were returned to custody. According to Prosecutor Li, if the informant cannot provide concrete evidence, the case will be terminated and no further hearings will be held.

### Floating Capital Pours Back Into Real Estate; Reaches 100 Million Gold Yuan in Two Months

After the currency reform, floating capital tended to buy real estate, creating a postwar boom. According to Chen Shukun, the secretary-general of the Real Estate Guild, the floating capital invested in real estate since August 19 has reached 100 million gold yuan, which is a huge amount, but not as much as expected. The reasons are: (1) Less than one-tenth of the houses and land in the city are immediately available. Vacant land with sheds, factory land, and houses with tenants cannot be investment targets. (2) The difficulty in obtaining building materials has made those who were originally interested in building houses hesitant. It is reported that recently, some people who had obtained building permits from the Public Works Bureau have applied for revocation. Chen said that most of the houses in the city are old and dilapidated, and it is estimated that the depreciation rate after one year will reach 1,000 units per room. If the difficulty of building houses is not resolved quickly, the housing problem in the city in the future will be very worrying. Ma Shaoquan, the chairman of the guild, is scheduled to go to Jiashan within days to purchase brick kilns on behalf of the guild to solve the urgent problem of brick and tile supply.

### The Economic Control Supervisor's Office States That It Will Eradicate the Black Market for Gold, Cash, and Cloth; Imported Goods Must Be Reported Within Three Days

The Economic Control Supervisor's Office believes that in the past, price fluctuations in Shanghai were led by gold, cash, and cloth. The office is paying close attention to the incipient black market for gold, cash, and cloth. At 6:00 PM yesterday, a spokesperson for the office publicly stated that although a very small number of black market transactions have occurred recently, the office is paying close attention and believes that this trend cannot be allowed to grow. The office is determined to eradicate it completely. In terms of gold and cash, those caught will be prosecuted under the "Disrupting Finance" clause of the Emergency Financial and Economic Decree promulgated by the government. In terms of cloth, Supervisor Jiang convened a temporary inspection meeting on the afternoon of the 15th and decided to proceed separately to prevent small-scale transactions from gradually spreading. Informants will be rewarded with 40% of the value of the confiscated goods, and those involved will be punished according to law. The same applies to daily necessities such as sugar and oil. The spokesperson also said: According to the office's investigation, there are underground warehouses. Once discovered, regardless of the quantity of goods or the length of storage, all goods will be confiscated, and those involved will be punished for hoarding and speculation. In addition, it has recently been discovered that stores are out of stock, causing inconvenience to citizens. According to a report from the Department Store Guild, this is due to the difficulty in wholesale. Supervisor Jiang has ordered the relevant trade associations to truthfully report the goods they need and ordered the factories to issue them accordingly. In order to strengthen the supply of raw materials, it has been discovered that importers are hoarding goods. The responsible persons of the trade association have been ordered to provide a list of goods that have arrived in the past three months within three days for the office to allocate to various factories to speed up manufacturing and supply to the market.

### October Rice Ration to Be Sold Starting Today

Sufficient Supply Guaranteed

The People's Livelihood Survey Committee has decided to start selling rice through rice stores starting today. Because purchasing from the production areas requires pairing whole rice with broken rice, and the prices are the same, the rice ration in the city will also be sold as a combination of whole rice and broken rice, totaling one dou (15 jin) per coupon, with 12 jin of whole rice and 3 jin of broken rice. The original prices for whole rice and broken rice will be maintained, and the two will be sold together for 9 jiao and 6 fen in gold yuan. Whole rice and broken rice will not be mixed and sold. Citizens are requested to bring two bags when purchasing to avoid confusion or disputes due to different quantities. It is understood that the city needs more than 500,000 shi of rice in October, and sufficient quantities have been prepared. However, because it needs to be transported from various places, the arrival of goods may vary. It is hoped that citizens will not rush and cause disturbances. This batch of rationed rice will be enough to feed more than one million citizens. The second and third batches will arrive in Shanghai around the 20th of this month, so every citizen will be able to purchase rationed rice before the end of the month and will not be disappointed.

### Anchang Pawnshop Murder for Money Case; Huang Yujia Executed by Firing Squad; Still Stubborn Before Execution

[This Newspaper] Huang Yujia, an apprentice at the Anchang Pawnshop who murdered for money, was executed by firing squad by the Special Criminal Court yesterday.

The case occurred at 9:00 PM on May 22 last year. Huang, a 25-year-old from Chaozhou, was the nephew of the pawnshop's owner. Because he was resentful of Pan Sanquan, the clerk in charge of the pawnshop's disaster relief, for refusing to lend him money, he killed Pan with a kitchen knife, then went upstairs and stole a large number of gold and silver jewelry and fled to Jinhua where he was arrested. He was originally sentenced to death by the District Court. After the establishment of the Special Criminal Court, the District Court transferred the case to the Special Criminal Court for trial, and he was still sentenced to death. The Central Special Criminal Court believed that he had robbed property and killed Pan Sanquan, and that his wickedness was profound, and approved the execution. At 10:10 AM yesterday, Huang was brought from the Shanghai Prison. Huang was tall and burly, wearing a blue Zhongshan suit, khaki pants, and black basketball shoes. Prosecutor Zhu Cheng took the stand, confirmed his identity, and informed him that the execution would be carried out today. He asked if he had any last words. Huang said that his parents were dead and he had not married, and he had no last words. He then claimed that he was 18 years old, not 25 years old, and hoped for a reduced sentence. The bailiffs persuaded him to drink, and Huang said, "Slowly, what's the rush?" His attitude was still very stubborn.

[This Newspaper] Wang Guoqiang, who also served as the squad leader of the 38th and 39th bao in Changshu District, had a disagreement with Sun Shuan and Zhou Qiyuan, the leaders of the two bao. On May 20 of this year, Wang fabricated the names of Ling Yunjian and Li Xiahou and reported to the Civil Affairs Bureau that Sun and Zhou had embezzled the settlement fees for draftees. When the bureau sent personnel to investigate, Wang took the opportunity to extort 60 million yuan from Sun and others, claiming to persuade Supervisor Yang, who was in charge of the investigation, to be lenient. Sun agreed and arranged to pay at Sun's house on June 3. He also reported to the Changshu Police Bureau. When Sun and others paid 10 million yuan in cash and 50 million yuan in checks, Wang was searched by the police officers in ambush after receiving the money and the case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution.

At around 10:00 AM on the 4th of this month, Wang went to He's store again and falsely claimed that he had received a secret report and was sent to investigate, but he could find a way to be lenient. He believed him and gave Wang 20 yuan in gold yuan, and Wang issued a receipt from a certain organization. On the 8th of this month, Wang went to He's place again, intending to intimidate him again. He was unwilling, so he took Wang to the police station. The police station then transferred him to the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning.

### Attempted Murder with a Knife: Jealous Woman Detained for Investigation

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wu Dacheng, a forty-year-old man from Jiangyin who runs a business at No. 15, Lane 1058, Xujiahui Road, has been living with Zhang Cuiying, a woman from Haizhou, for twenty-three years at that location. They have no children together, but Ms. Zhang adopted a daughter, Jin Fang, who is now fifteen years old and treated as her own. However, Wu has a fondness for women, and six years ago, he also became involved with Chen Ahua, a woman from Ningbo, renting a house for her at No. 158 Yongnian Road. They have a son and a daughter together. Later, Ms. Zhang found out about this and often quarreled with Wu. Despite the fact that the situation was irreversible, she remained resentful and harbored a secret desire to harm her. On the morning of the 12th of this month at 10 a.m., Zhang went to Xujiahui alone to buy a butcher knife. Her daughter noticed and hid the knife, but she found it again the next day. That night, Wu was supposed to spend the night with Zhang, but he ended up staying with Chen. On the morning of the 14th, Zhang still hadn't seen Wu return to the shop, so she hid the knife in her clothes and followed him. She saw Wu and Chen sleeping intimately together, and her jealousy overwhelmed her. Just as she was about to draw the knife and attack, Wu woke up and snatched the knife, during which her right finger was cut. At the same time, Ms. Chen cried out for help, alarming the neighbors who called the police. The police arrested Zhang along with the murder weapon and took her to the local police station, where she was charged with attempted murder and handed over to the local procuratorate for interrogation.

### Following Huang Pinfa, Another New Invention: Automatic Fare Meter for Tricycles

[Our Newspaper's Report] After Huang Pinfa invented a mileage calculator for tricycles, it has been learned that Sun Wei Yin, a member of the Greater Shanghai Youth Service Corps, has also invented a more complete fare meter for tricycles. This meter can automatically calculate the fare for the entire trip based on the ratio of government-set fares and mileage, using specially made parts inside the meter. It can immediately display the amount due when the vehicle stops, without having to convert mileage into fares. The principle is similar to that of Huang's invention. This type of meter can also be mass-produced in a short period of time using bakelite and other raw materials, at a very low cost. The Youth Service Corps has submitted the invention to the Supervisor's Office for consideration. - Stop and Know the Fare Immediately

### Managing Vegetable Markets: Vegetables Sold in Limited Quantities; Daily Arrivals Must First be Registered

In order to facilitate the supply of vegetables and crack down on scalpers, the Laozha Police Sub-bureau, in addition to encouraging vegetable vendors to purchase and sell vegetables from the producing areas, has also begun to implement quantitative sales management of the vegetable market supply. That is, each vegetable vendor must first register the quantity of pork, beef, fish, duck, and eggs with the Management Team of the Vegetable Market Management Committee of the sub-bureau. After the team compiles the total quantity, in addition to a portion being specifically supplied to restaurants, the rest is supplied to the public in limited quantities. Each person can purchase one jin of pork, two jin of half-lean pork, one duck, and a fresh fish weighing about two jin. The quantity of eggs is determined by the amount of goods arriving. The personnel of the management team will closely supervise transactions on the spot. After the implementation of this method at the Fuzhou Road vegetable market for two days, the situation has been very good. However, due to the crowding of buyers, each person only has the opportunity to buy one or two types of vegetables.

(3) A mobile service team will be established in each street to strengthen investigation efficiency. Each team consists of six people wearing specially made armbands and will not act alone.

### Exhaustion of Kaiyuan Coal Supply: Shanghai's Safety Coal Begins to be Used

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to Zhu Shilong, Director of the Anthracite Coal Regulation and Supply Office, the main reason for the recent depletion of coal resources in this city is that all the coal transport ships under the office's control have been requisitioned. Therefore, although there are coal reserves in various places, it is temporarily impossible to transport them to Shanghai for supply. However, he is still making every effort to utilize the spare tonnage of other merchant ships for transportation. For example, there are currently 30,000 tons of coal stored in a certain area. A deal has been negotiated for the Huasheng, a ship that travels from port to Taiwan and then to Shanghai, to transport about 8,000 tons, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai within one or two days. There are also about 20,000 tons of coal stored in Tanggu New Port. It would also be possible to negotiate for ships to transport it, but the Kailuan Coal Mine hopes to raise the price of coal to 31 yuan per ton (delivery price at Tanggu Port). If it were transported to Shanghai at this price, it would be impossible to distribute it. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce had already stipulated that the coal price for October would remain the same as the original price in September, so a telegram has been sent to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for instructions. At the same time, a telegram has also been sent to the Kailuan Coal Mine authorities, hoping that they can first allocate the coal for transportation, and then reply regarding the price. Currently, this city has about 30,000 tons of Kailuan coal (safety coal), and a small amount has already been used. However, if the transportation issue is resolved and the coal supply from various places is smooth, the safety coal can be replenished.

### Third Section of the Sui District Headquarters, Operations Section Chief General Li Quan Escapes Danger and Arrives in Qingdao to Discuss the Jinan Campaign

[Qingdao Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 10th] Li Quan, Operations Section Chief of the Third Section of the Jinan Sui District Headquarters, hid among the people after the bandits broke into Jinan. He escaped danger from Jinan on the 28th and arrived in Qingdao after a long and arduous journey. Immediately after removing the dust of travel, he met with reporters to discuss the details of the Jinan campaign. Since the fall of Jinan, rumors have been circulating, with many discrepancies. As for the overall situation of the deployment and conduct of the battle, only those in the command headquarters who directly participated in the battle could know it deeply. This is the inevitable situation in military affairs. Therefore, past piecemeal reports were either based on materials obtained from the Ministry of National Defense or the Xuzhou Command Post, or were not concrete. Li Quan is the only one who has escaped from the command headquarters and come to Qingdao. At the time of the battle, he assisted Chief of Staff Luo Xinli in defending the Sui District Headquarters, managing everything. Therefore, what he says should be the most accurate account of the situation at the time. The following is a transcript of General Li Quan's remarks:

"The bandit army besieged Jinan, using forces from the 3rd, 7th, 9th, 10th, 13th, New 8th, Bohai, Liangguang, and Rapid Columns, as well as 300,000 local military region troops. It can be said that they mobilized all their forces in Shandong to attack. Among them, the 7th, 9th, 13th, Bohai, and Rapid Columns were the bandits' elite, all composed of three divisions, attacking our eastern front. The New 8th Column attacked our railway front. North of the Yellow River was the Liangguang Column, and south of Changqing and the railway were the 3rd and 10th Columns, both composed of two divisions, remnants of the Yudong campaign.

The National Army consisted of the 2nd Division (totaling three brigades), the 73rd Division (totaling three brigades), the 84th Division of Wu Huawen (totaling three brigades: the 155th Brigade, the 161st Brigade, and the Independent Brigade), and three security brigades formed by security teams that broke out of Weixian. They defended the city walls, but their combat power and equipment were poor. In addition, there were two battalions of the 74th Division, which were transported by air.

When the battle first started, in addition to Yan Zifeng's troops guarding Changqing and Luokou with one brigade each, the defense of the Jinan area was roughly divided into east and west zones along a vertical line drawn from Luokou, with Cao Zhenduo and Wu Huawen each commanding their respective divisions. Each of the three divisions controlled one brigade as a mobile force.

Fighting Situation on the Outskirts

Here is an overview of the fighting on the outskirts: After the Chen bandits captured Yanzhou in June of this year, they actively prepared to invade Jinan for three months. On the 14th of this (September), they still adopted their usual tactic of feigning an attack in the east while striking in the west. First, the Liangguang Column attacked the north bank of the Yellow River, the 3rd and 10th Columns attacked Changqing, and the New 8th Column attacked the front of the Jinpu Railway. Then, the most elite 7th, 9th, 13th, Bohai, and Rapid Columns launched a fierce attack on the eastern suburbs of Jinan. The curtain on the Jinan defense battle thus opened. After discovering the bandits' intentions, and after fierce fighting, the strongholds in Qihe, Changqing, and other places on the western front of Jinan were gradually abandoned on the 15th, and they were transferred to the established positions on the outer perimeter of Jinan. (Deployment of positions as shown in the attached map.)

After dusk on the 16th, the bandits began a fierce attack on the Maocen Mountain and Yanchi Mountain positions in the eastern suburbs of the city. The bandits first bombarded with intense artillery fire, followed by infantry assaults. The fighting was fierce throughout the night, and the defending troops suffered heavy casualties. The defending army battalion commander, Zhu Guanghua, was executed for ineffective combat. On the 17th, the bandits attacked Xunliuzhuang, and the battle became even more intense. The defending troops were determined to coexist with the position. After a day of fierce fighting, the entire 45th Regiment of the 15th Brigade was heroically sacrificed. Regiment Commander Li Pu was wounded and committed suicide with a grenade. On the 18th, the bandits continued their westward attack on Majiazhuang, and the 19th and 57th Brigades were deployed to reinforce. The battle for Majiazhuang was the most intense. The bandits and our troops each occupied half of the village. After four days and nights of bloody fighting, the bandits' offensive was slightly thwarted due to heavy casualties, and the battle situation on the eastern front gradually stabilized. As of this day, the National Army's outer defense battle was entirely on the eastern front, and the initial plan to hold firm had been completed. According to accurate judgment, the bandits' elite 9th Column had suffered almost complete casualties. The remaining troops also suffered heavy losses. The distance between the bandits and our troops was only one to two hundred meters.

At 6:00 p.m. on the 19th, it was suddenly reported by Wang Tongyu, regiment commander of the 465th Regiment of the 155th Brigade of Wu Huawen's unit, that Wu's unit would defect at 12:00 p.m. that night and would attack the commercial port. The defection was sudden, and the situation was shocking. The four brigades of troops that could be commanded were still fighting the bandits on the outer perimeter. Wu's three brigades were still intact. Given the situation at the time, the situation was extremely critical. The original plan was to break through in two directions, north and south, but due to the heavy encirclement by the bandits and Wu's rebels, and the fact that the eastern front was still engaged in intense fighting with the bandits, it was not easy to disengage the battlefield. However, at the beginning of the planned action, Mu Zhongheng and Director Liao Weiwen (Third Section) and others had successfully broken through to the north. Various external rumors were all hearsay. Finally, after discussions between the command headquarters and the division and brigade commanders, it was decided that the main force would defend the city walls and that a portion would defend the southern suburbs of Sili Mountain and Qianfo Mountain, as well as the commercial port's Provincial Hospital, Packaging Factory, the Postal Building where the Sui District Headquarters was located, and key points such as the former German Consulate and the railway station. At that time, more than a regiment of Wu Ni Huawen's troops had infiltrated the western part of the city. Wang Sherenzhuang was still defended by the Licheng County team. Zhang Jingyue was originally responsible for the defense of the city walls, but by this point, he no longer had any tasks.

The Course of the Battle in the Urban Area

Next, I will describe the course of the battle in the urban area: The entire day of the 20th was quiet. At night, Wu Huawen's troops opened up the front, and the bandit army entered the urban area and attacked our strongholds in the city. The defending troops resisted bravely, but all attempts were unsuccessful. The struggle for the Provincial Hospital was particularly fierce. In the urban area, the bandits attacked the Yonggu Gate near the outer east city, and climbed the city walls several times, but were all annihilated and repelled. The three security brigades were extremely brave in defending the Puli Gate, Hanshi Bridge, Yonggu Gate, and Qilu University.

On the 21st, the bandits continued to attack the key points of the commercial port. The Wang Buqing Regiment of the 211st Brigade, which defended the Provincial Hospital, was completely and heroically sacrificed after two days and nights of fierce fighting. The struggle for the main railway station and the postal building was extremely fierce. The bandits who attacked the railway station had a regiment annihilated by our Ma Peiji Brigade. In the urban area, the bandits' attacks on the east city were the most intense. At midnight, a unit broke into the Yonggu Gate.

On the 22nd, the defending troops at the commercial port railway station, the postal building, the former German consulate, and other strongholds broke out to the west and north due to excessive casualties, and then communication was cut off. In the urban area, the bandits who broke into the Yonggu Gate continued to increase their forces and attacked the inner city. The bandits at Hanshi Bridge also launched a massive offensive, climbing the city walls several times, but were all annihilated and repelled. Later, due to excessive casualties among the defending troops, the bandits broke in, and there was a street-by-street struggle, which was extremely fierce. They gradually moved to the innermost core position to hold firm.

At 6:00 p.m. on the 23rd, the bandits used more than a hundred large-caliber guns to concentrate their fire on the inner city, attempting to first destroy our command center. For a time, shells rained down, flames filled the sky, and the entire city was a sea of fire. More than 10,000 shells were fired, and there was no place in the city where shells did not fall. In particular, the provincial government and the old provincial government Huangting, where the command headquarters was located, received the most shells. The intensity of the artillery fire was unprecedented in the War of Resistance against Japan and the various bandit suppression campaigns. At this time, a concrete bunker behind the provincial government was hit by an armor-piercing shell, and many provincial government personnel were sacrificed. The special service regiment also sacrificed fifty or sixty people in an hour under the artillery fire. Our artillery positions were moved into the provincial government, the old provincial government, and Huangting. The anti-aircraft guns and other defenses were fired excessively and exploded. At this time, the air force reconnaissance only saw a sea of fire, which shows the intensity of the artillery fire. Communication was completely cut off, and even the buried cables were broken. The bandits then launched a large-scale infantry attack on the east, south, and west sides of the city, climbing the city walls. At that time, the commander and the division and brigade commanders personally supervised the battle at the edge of the city, and the morale was extremely high. The bandits broke in five times in the southeast corner, but were all annihilated. The bandits' eleven offensives in the southwest corner were repelled. At dawn on the 24th, the city walls in the southeast corner, Xindong Gate, and the meteorological station were destroyed by the bandits' artillery, leaving three breaches. Due to excessive casualties among the defending troops, the bandits broke in from the breaches, and fierce street fighting broke out in the city. At 10:00 a.m., when the bandits approached Huangting, the commander led the personnel of the command post near Beijige, but was blocked by Daming Lake, and the strength of the defending troops had been exhausted. By this time, there was no way to reverse the critical situation. He was forced to lead the remaining troops of the special service regiment and a part of Wang Jingzhen's 15th Brigade to break out to the north. The situation thereafter is unknown. The bandits in the city continued to press westward, fighting house by house. At 4:00 p.m., they attacked and entered the provincial government. At that time, the west of the provincial government and the northwest corner of the city were still defended by the remnants of Qian Boying's 77th Brigade. At dawn on the 25th, the bandits launched another large-scale attack. The defending troops were strong and resisted to the death. After a fierce battle until 5:00 p.m., all the defending troops were heroically sacrificed. The battle in the urban area came to an end. However, there were still sporadic battles after nightfall, and sparse gunshots. At that time, Qianfo Mountain and Sili Mountain in the southern suburbs were still in our hands, and the defending troops in Wang Sherenzhuang broke out to the south. At dawn on the 26th, the bandits attacked Qianfo Mountain and Sili Mountain in the southern suburbs. After a day of fierce fighting, the Hu Jingyuan regiment of the 213th Brigade and a battalion of Wang Jingzhen's 15th Brigade broke out to the south. Thus, the Jinan defense battle came to an end. The radio of the commander's command post at Beijige was cut off from external contact at 10:00 a.m. on the 24th. The radio of Chief of Staff Luo at the provincial government command headquarters was cut off from external contact at 4:00 p.m. on the same day.

Reasons for Abandoning Jinan City

The Jinan defense battle began with the preliminary battle on September 14 and ended with the fall of the southern suburban mountains on the 26th, totaling twelve days and nights of bloody fighting. It is estimated that more than 60,000 bandits were killed or wounded, and we also suffered more than 40,000 casualties. Especially in the final urban area battle, under extremely difficult conditions, the officers and soldiers of the National Army gave their lives, and their morale was high. They were all determined to coexist with the city, and they were extremely loyal, brave, and heroic. If Wu Ni Huawen had not defected midway, Jinan could definitely have been secured without worry.

The reasons for abandoning Jinan were, first, Wu Huawen's defection. By the 19th, the National Army had lost about two of its six brigades. Wu Huawen's three brigades were still intact, and Wu's troops knew everything about the National Army's combat plans and the internal situation in Jinan. The second was the forced retreat to the urban area, which changed the entire combat plan. The original plan was to use Xinzhuang, Ma'anshan, Qianfo Mountain, and other places as the final core positions, with two-thirds of the food and ammunition stockpiled near Xinzhuang. Wu's rebellion took place suddenly, and the National Army was forced to change its plan and use the urban area as the core.

The third was that the urban area had dense houses and narrow streets, which were not conducive to street fighting. At the same time, the houses outside the city were too close to the city walls, and they were all high-rise buildings. After the Lunan campaign, in order to meet military needs, we once planned to demolish some of the houses to clear the firing range, but it was opposed by local gentry and could not be thoroughly implemented, which is very regrettable."

### Bizarre Official Career Drama: Cheng Yaobi Fails to Obtain an Official Position, Alleging That Director Deng Demanded Bribes

[Dispatch from Hankou, 15th] A bizarre drama of failing to obtain an official position has recently occurred in the Hubei Provincial Government. Cheng Yaobi, a qualified county magistrate assigned to this province by the Administrative Yuan's Pacification Zone Political Affairs Committee, has been assigned as an inspector by the provincial government for a long time without obtaining a substantive position, and is very dissatisfied. He has publicly stated that Director Deng extorted gold bars from him, and has written to the provincial government stating: "I am a qualified county magistrate selected by the central government, and there is no need for me to move to another position. However, the director of the Civil Affairs Department of your government has repeatedly indicated the conditions for socializing, but I am poor and cannot comply. Even if I were rich, I would not be willing to bribe my way into an official position," etc. Upon receiving the report, Deng also issued a statement saying: "It has been found that this official has a volatile temperament and shallow academic qualifications, and is not suitable for immediately serving as a county magistrate. This department has assigned him as an inspector in order to give him the opportunity to observe. Now that this official has failed to obtain an official position, he dares to slander his superiors with absurd words. His nerves are obviously not very sound. If he is assigned to govern a county, it will inevitably harm the local area," and so on.

### The Abnormal Relationship of Cotton Cloth in Nantong Urgently Needs to Be Broken (Part 1)

— Our Reporter Cong Yongshu

[Dispatch from Nantong, 12th] The tide of "shortages" and "panic buying" is attacking northern Jiangsu with the chilling autumn wind. The calm of northern Jiangsu after the currency reform has once again been disturbed by price fluctuations.

Rugao, which exports pigs, is experiencing a meat shortage, and Nantong, which produces cotton, is complaining that it cannot collect cotton. Daily necessities, silk, and department stores are even more "short in stock" because they are "imported goods."

Flow of Materials Eastward

Take Nantong as an example. The price limits are only stricter in the urban areas. The prices of various goods in the eastern part of Nantong are generally higher than in the urban areas, resulting in the phenomenon of materials flowing eastward. Some people have even temporarily changed careers to become "scalpers." It is said that if you can buy a small package of foreign yarn from the city and transport it to an area thirty to fifty miles to the east, you can at least earn five gold yuan.

In the towns, it is also difficult to buy rice. The limited price for good rice has now been replaced by inferior rice. If you want to buy it, it will be something with a moldy taste and mixed with sand. Buying cloth is also troublesome. The cloth in the windows of cloth stores has become much sparser. If you want to choose the quality or pattern, the clerk will say: the good ones have already been sold, and there is no way to replenish them. There are only these few kinds left. There is also no meat. Since entering October, there has been no limited-price meat for sale. The military meat that is supplied at a subsidized price has also not been supplied for ten days. Only restaurants and "eaters" who love meat like their own lives send people to drill into the black market. The fish stalls are always empty. The fishmongers stand by and greet familiar patrons to choose at their homes. This is a favor, and the price has to be calculated accordingly. Tofu and dried tea have not risen in price, and there is no black market, but the volume has shrunk by nearly one-third. Green vegetables, radishes, and taro are common vegetables, and have almost doubled in price compared to ten days ago. Everyone is only afraid of not being able to buy them, and does not ask whether the price has risen or not.

Reasons for Shortages

The reasons for the "shortages" can probably be divided into two aspects. One aspect is affected by the "prohibition of exports" in other places and the "price limits" in this area. The prohibition of exports in neighboring places has made the source of goods difficult, naturally forming a shortage phenomenon. After the price limits, merchants from other ports are mostly calculating how much money they can earn by transporting goods to a certain place, and avoid transporting goods to this side. More importantly, northern Jiangsu is closer to the bandit areas than southern Jiangsu, and the bandit army is carrying out economic destruction here. Now is the autumn harvest season, and the fields of northern Jiangsu have golden grains, silvery white cotton, soybeans, and miscellaneous grains. However, the cities in the fields of northern Jiangsu are experiencing food and cotton shortages. The scattered bandits in the rural areas are agitating to cover up the "autumn tax collection" work. The government districts have price limits on all kinds of goods, and they are buying them at any price. The profiteers only recognize making money. As long as there is money to earn, and the more they earn, the more they do not care about anything and do everything they can to extract goods from the price limits to obtain more illegal profits.

Quality Deteriorating Daily

Cotton cloth is an economic link formed by agriculture, industry, and handicrafts in Nantong, and it is an economic feature of Nantong.

The area near Nantong is a cotton-producing area, and this time of year is usually the time when "cotton flows like clouds" (the horizontal strip often posted at cotton shops). But this year it is not the same. On the one hand, there are price limits on cotton, and cotton farmers do not want to use money and are unwilling to sell cotton. On the other hand, most of the cotton fields are in bandit areas, and cotton cannot be transported out. Under these circumstances, small manufacturers are scrambling to buy, weighing 100 jin of seed cotton and calculating the price of 115 jin to 120 jin, that is, increasing the price of cotton by 15% to 20%. This way of doing black market is called "releasing the scale" or "pulling the scale." Because of the scramble to buy, even mixed and watered cotton are bought. As long as it is cotton, it is bought, resulting in the price of cotton rising daily and the quality deteriorating daily.

### With the Development of Purchasing Work by the Industry, Rice Arrivals in the Rice Market Are Gradually Increasing, and Rice Merchants Are Finding It Quite Difficult Due to the Suppression of Rice Quantities in Various Places

[Our Dispatch] Since the rice industry began its purchasing work, arrivals have been gradually increasing. Yesterday, 151 shi were reported to the Nanshi market by traders, and 387 shi and 7 dou were reported by rice shops. 723 shi were reported to the Beishi market by traders, and 174 shi were reported by rice shops, and 373 shi and 7 dou were reported by rice mills, totaling 1,709 shi and 4 dou. Except for rice shops and rice mills supplying their own retail stores, the goods from the traders were all sold on the market at the limited price.

The transaction of miscellaneous grains was slack, with only sporadic sales. The price of Guiyang black beans was 20 yuan for several tens. Black sesame seeds opened 13 packages, priced at 28 yuan. Kaifeng Tizhuang peanuts sold 12 packages, priced at 32 yuan and 7 jiao. Everything else was not sold.

[Another Dispatch] According to a certain leading figure in the rice industry, after rice merchants in the city contracted to handle 200,000 dan of rice for the city, they are currently purchasing from various production areas separately. The more distant areas are Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jintan, which account for a larger volume. The nearer areas are Songjiang, Qingpu, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changshu, which account for a smaller volume. However, the transport of rice to Shanghai from various places is often detained by the local authorities, which inevitably delays the date of transport to Shanghai. Recently, the situation has improved after the supervisors' office sent telegrams to negotiate separately. The first batch of rice from Songjiang, about 1,000 dan, can arrive in Shanghai within two or three days after being released. However, they are most troubled by two points: (1) The amount of rice purchased from various places is often suppressed. For example, in Suzhou, the limited price for every 154 jin should be 18 yuan. Although the limited price has not changed recently, the amount has been suppressed from 154 jin to 140 jin, and even to the most recent 132 jin. The same is true for Dangshu. The limited price of 18 yuan for every 154 jin has recently been reduced to only 110 jin or so. This directly affects the cost of handling rice. (2) The rice purchased from various places has a very rough appearance. In the future, when it is transported to Shanghai for sale, some misunderstandings are inevitable. Therefore, the Rice Merchants' Association yesterday submitted a report to the Supervisors' Office, the Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Special Police Department, and the Economic Police Brigade, five agencies, requesting instructions for relief measures, it is said.

### Cotton Yarn Required for the Reproduction Industry Will Be Handled and Rationed as a Whole, and a Meeting Will Be Held by the Materials Adjustment Committee to Discuss

Regarding the issue of cotton yarn supply for the reproduction industry, Pan Tuhao, chairman of the industry's association, once discussed the allocation of yarn with Yu Hongjun, president of the National Bank, and proposed a public and unified allocation method to maintain the production of the industry. It is heard that Pan's proposal has been approved by President Yu, and a meeting will be held by the Materials Adjustment Committee within days to discuss the matter. According to the person in charge of the industry, the current stock of 20-count cotton yarn required by the industry in Shanghai is more than 10,000 pieces from the National Bank, 3,000 pieces from the Textile Adjustment Committee, and 45,000 pieces of US aid yarn. The actual monthly yarn requirement of the industry is 40,000 pieces, so they are still concerned about the supply issue in the future. The 30,000 pieces of cotton yarn required by the industry have been approved by the Economic Management and Supervision Office, but have not yet been allocated.

Yesterday, the yarn and cloth markets continued to be closed. The Textile Construction Company opened yarn as usual, opening blue orders for 20-count Qiuhuo at a price of 700 yuan, which was purchased by yarn merchants from other ports. White orders were 6-count Fu Riguang at 255 yuan, 15-count Shouyunian straw bales at 573 yuan, 32-count double-strand Fengnian big bales at 880 yuan, 42-count double-strand Lima cones at 990 yuan, 42-count double-strand second-class Jane cones at 960 yuan, and 40-count three-strand Baoguang straw bales at 1,030 yuan. The 15-count yarns were limited to blanket manufacturers to apply for purchase, the 32-count yarns were limited to electrical film manufacturers, and the 21-count yarns were limited to optional purchases.

In addition, the Textile Construction Company's out-of-town yarn allocation for the first half of October included 43 pieces of 20-count Jiushi for Wuxi, 30 pieces for Wujin, and 40 pieces of 20-count Cai Kuixing, 33 pieces of 20-count Jiushi for Dangshu, 9 pieces of 20-count Cai Kuixing for Wuxian, 18 pieces of 20-count Cai Kuixing for Jiangyin, 25 pieces for Nanhui, 6 pieces for Pinghu, 9 pieces for Chuansha, and 5 pieces for Songjiang, and 9 pieces for Xin Yunhui, totaling 227 pieces. The price was 700 yuan each. Blue order forms must be used for purchase orders, and the yarn payment must be paid to the Bund Central Bank.

The Cotton Cloth Association yesterday afternoon distributed approximately 12,000 pieces of cloth produced by private factories, including more than 2,000 pieces of white cloth and approximately 9,000 pieces of colored cloth (including printed cloth and sound-printing cloth). There were more than 80 types of patterns and varieties. The distribution price was based on the "August 19" limited price distribution method. In order to ensure uniformity, the distribution was divided into five groups: wholesalers, retail stores, bulk merchants, retail merchants, and finishing factories. The distribution unit was 10 pieces per purchase. It is heard that there were more than 1,500 registered purchasers. The New Feng Printing and Dyeing Factory had the largest number of distributed cloths in this period.

### Japanese Woolen Fabrics Bidding Suspended, China Trust Bureau Will Change Methods

The Central Trust Bureau, acting as an agent for the sale of government materials, the Property Committee, the Taizhou bidding materials, the bulk of which was a large number of broken rice entrusted by the Mindi Commission to be sold by tender, totaling about 20,000 bags. There was also a batch of newsprint, which was also sold by tender on the 15th. There was quite a crowd of rice and paper merchants from the city who went to apply for the tender. According to the person in charge of the association, in recent weeks, each time the materials were sold by tender, all of them were fully bid, and there was almost a situation of demand exceeding supply. Therefore, the bidding of woolen fabrics has been temporarily suspended this week, and will be resumed after the method is improved.

### National Bank Allocates 20 Million US Dollars to Increase Imports of Industrial Raw Materials, Entrusting the China Trust Bureau with Procurement

Regarding the direct import of industrial raw materials from abroad to increase production, the Supervisor's Office has now reached a new decision. The method involves the National Bank issuing an additional 20 million US dollars outside the foreign exchange allocation quota, entrusting the China Trust Bureau to be responsible for procurement.

[Another Dispatch] According to discussions with major industrialists and businessmen in the city, although self-provided foreign exchange has been opened, price adjustments for goods are still not possible. The difficulties felt by the industrial and commercial sectors are still numerous. Due to rising overseas prices, the import cost of industrial raw materials is very high, and most finished products using imported raw materials cannot be sold at the limited price. At present, the capital of various industrial factories is meager, and they cannot directly remit funds to order goods from abroad. If importers see no profit, they have no intention of importing. Therefore, in addition to hoping for the opening of self-provided foreign exchange, it is also hoped that the authorities will reasonably adjust the prices of imported raw materials and finished products.

### Tea Market Trading is Mediocre

Yesterday's tea market continued to see mediocre trading and narrow transactions, with a quiet and uneventful process. Prices remained consistent with previous assessments. It is learned that the Chinese government recently shipped a large quantity of black tea to the Soviet Union, reportedly for debt repayment. It is also said that a batch of high-quality Ping Shui green tea will also be exported to the same destination and preparations for collection and assembly are currently underway. Another dispatch states that Qimen black tea, most favored by the British, has been lacking due to disparity in sales negotiations. However, recently, due to urgent overseas demand, exporters have regained momentum and are again consulting with principals.

### Many Scramble for Cigarettes, Popular Brands Out of Stock Again

Recently, popular cigarette brands have disappeared from the market again, with it being nearly impossible to purchase brands such as Da Nan Wei San Pao Tai. The Social Affairs Bureau is paying close attention to this and has notified the Yizhong Company and Yongtaihe to expedite delivery. It is reported that the reason for the current shortage of Yizhong cigarettes is (1) citizen hoarding, and (2) insufficient distribution. Even with distribution, huge quantities of goods are quickly snatched up. It is said that both parties are considering a good method to curb hoarding.

[Another Dispatch] According to information from the cigarette industry, most of the high-quality tobacco leaves come from abroad, but they are now nearly absent. Therefore, the raw materials for high-quality cigarettes have become a major problem. Furthermore, after cigarettes are made, they must be stored for one or two months, otherwise the cigarettes will be hard and tight and cannot be smoked. Currently, in order to meet market demand, factories are shipping cigarettes immediately after production, with little or no stock.

### Sugar Purchase Applications are Enthusiastic

Sugar transactions in the market yesterday were changed to rationing, and trading among peers has ceased. The sales at Tai Jie Men have been unable to meet demand recently, with substantial sales volume and enthusiastic applications from end-users.

### Sharp Decline in Tung Oil Production in Zhejiang Province

Although Zhejiang Province is not one of the largest tung oil-producing provinces in the country, through years of government promotion, the area planted with tung trees reached 65,607 mu by 1941. The producing areas are distributed in more than 40 counties in the upstream of the Qiantang River and the Ou River basin. Since the tung tree planting areas are all mountainous regions, with barren land and poor people, farmers regard tung tree planting as a major sideline. North of the Xin'an River, the three counties of Fen Shui, Chun'an, and Yu Qian each produced around 15,000 dan in 1941, accounting for one-fifth of the province's total output, making them the most productive areas for tung oil in the province. In addition, counties such as Jiang Shan, Shou Chang, Jin Yun, Jian De, Xian Ju, etc., each produced more than 10,000 dan, and counties such as Sui Chang, Lan Xi, Tong Lu, Li Shui, Chang Shan, Jin Hua, Yong Jia, Zhu Ji, Xuan Ping, and Tai Shun, etc., each produced more than 5,000 dan, all of which are major tung oil-producing counties. The province's total annual output is around 200,000 dan, accounting for one-tenth of the national output.

Before the war, tung oil produced in Zhejiang was sold in various counties within the province, accounting for one-quarter. Those transported to other provinces and abroad accounted for three-quarters. The concentration points for tung oil transported to other places were Hangzhou, Yongjia, Quzhou, and Lanxi. During the peak season, oil factories would set up shops to handle business, transporting tung oil from Quzhou and Lanxi to Hangzhou or Yongjia, and then re-exporting it. In the early days of the War of Resistance, tung oil was a major military supply. Under the government's efforts to promote the tung tree planting industry in Zhejiang Province, it became a trend. The area of tung forests increased year by year. According to a survey, the output in the three years of 1937 and 1940 almost doubled compared to before the war. The tung oil exported through Wenzhou and Ningbo reached 165,157 dan in 1938, 221,645 dan in 1939, and 130,403 dan in 1940. If it could have been promoted smoothly, the tung oil production in the province would not have been difficult to exceed 1 million dan. However, the situation changed, the sea ports were blocked, and the occupied areas gradually expanded. After 1941, due to transportation difficulties, purchasing agencies failed to purchase as much as possible, resulting in goods being abandoned on the ground, with no one to care. Subsequently, food prices soared and wages increased, and tung farmers even cut down tung trees and replanted miscellaneous grains, resulting in a sharp decline in tung oil production. Fortunately, in 1942, the tung oil gasoline production test was successful, and oil refineries on both sides of the Ou River were established in succession, using tung oil to extract gasoline, kerosene, and diesel to supply the needs of the rear, which helped to reverse the decline of tung oil to a great extent. After the victory, it was estimated that the tung oil production in each county had decreased by at least 25% and at most 75% compared to before the war, with an average statistic of 50%, and the province's annual output was only about 80,000 dan.

### Reduced Pig Supply, Difficulties in Intestine Export

According to information from the sausage casing export industry, recently, due to the reduced supply of vegetables in Beijing, Shanghai, and their suburbs, residents have difficulty obtaining meat. Even occasional pig slaughtering is mostly sought through the black market, and even pig intestines are snatched up. Now, due to the fact that supplying domestic consumption is more profitable than exporting, the source of sausage casing has been cut off. The Jiangbei area, which used to be the main supplier of sausage casing, has also reduced its supply due to poor conditions. Not only is the purchase price too high, but it is also impossible to purchase in large quantities. Sausage casing is produced in various countries and is not unique to us. Now that the domestic purchase price is high and the overseas sales price is not optimistic for the time being, most sausage casing exporters have withdrawn. The small amount of dried intestines purchased are transported to Guangdong and Hong Kong for making sausages and cannot be exported.

### No Silk Available

Yesterday, the Silk Association's rationing of raw silk saw a daily decrease in applicants. The allocated amount was insufficient, and the small quantities were not enough to satisfy applicants. The sales quota at silk stores was also limited yesterday, restricting sales. Silk weaving businesses had separate allocations, but the quantity was limited. There was no silk available for domestic or export sales, and trading was sluggish, with no transactions heard throughout the day. Sales of silk fabrics have been slow recently, but purchasing by merchants from other regions has been active, and factories are receiving orders and are unable to accept any more, often refusing them.

### For Remittances Over 1,000 Yuan, the Recipient Must Provide a Guarantee

The Financial Management Bureau, following the instructions of the Ministry of Finance, stated: "This Ministry stipulates that for domestic remittances handled by money shops and banks, if the amount of each transaction exceeds 200 million legal tender, the recipient should provide a reliable guarantee to prove the accuracy of their name and address before payment is allowed. Since the currency reform, after careful examination of the current situation, the original regulations should be appropriately modified. It is now revised to state that if the recipient is a legitimate business in the remittance bank's local area that has joined the trade association and is well-known to the bank, they may be exempted from providing a guarantee. If the recipient is an individual and the remittance amount exceeds 1,000 yuan, they must still provide a reliable guarantee to prove the accuracy of their name and address before payment is allowed. If there are restrictions on the payment of remittances in a specific area, the regulations of that area should be followed." The bureau has instructed the Taishi Money Shop and Trust Association to pass this on to all banks, shops, and companies for compliance.

### Zhang Junmai Gives Academic Speeches in Wuhan, Praises Confucian Scholars of the Song Dynasty as True Educators

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 15th Dispatch] Zhang Junmai recently gave two lectures at Zhonghua University, "The Cabinet Responsibility System in the Constitution" and "Education and Philosophy." Zhang pointed out that the five powers in the constitution exist only in name, but he opposed amending the current constitution, saying that the constitution is like a newly planted seedling, which should be allowed to grow vigorously and should not be arbitrarily uprooted or have its leaves removed. Discussing "Education and Philosophy," he said that true educators do not regard education as a career, but rather broaden their outlook on life and teach the next generation with tireless enthusiasm. Zhang praised Zhou Jiaoyi and Cheng Mingjin of the Song Dynasty as true great educators, and compared himself to a failed educator. He believes that educators must look at the universe from the perspective of Taoism and act according to Confucianism. In addition, Yu Jiaju, leader of the Youth Party, also arrived in Hankou by boat on the 15th to give lectures.

### Professors in the Capital Jointly Appeal to the Authorities, Demanding Improved Treatment for Public Educators, While Submitting 11 Funding Suggestions

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Qiu Zhizhong, Cui Jingbo, Fang Hao, Shao Yulin, Li Dongfang, Yang Zhaolong, and 105 other professors from universities in the capital recently jointly issued a public appeal to the authorities demanding improved treatment for public educators. It stated that since the currency reform, the base salary for public educators has been too low, while prices in various places have continued to rise, and the purchasing power of the gold yuan has fallen to only one-sixth of the pre-war legal tender. However, the treatment of public educators is only one-twenty-fourth of the pre-war real value. Moreover, salaries are frozen indefinitely, while prices are rising indefinitely, which is not only unreasonable in fact, but will also put public educators to death. Poor treatment of public educators will inevitably lead to daily preoccupation with firewood, rice, oil, and salt, resulting in low administrative efficiency and the failure of the political and academic environment. This will not only directly affect the country's expectations of increasing revenue, but also indirectly undermine the success of emergency financial and economic measures to reform the currency, and even endanger the great cause of national construction. They demanded that starting from August, all public educators nationwide should receive gold yuan salaries that are double their original salary amount based on the pre-war currency value. However, in order to consider the burden on the national treasury, personnel at all levels voluntarily donate one-quarter of their salary as a special contribution for national construction and relief. Another quarter will be used for a savings association, until the end of the war. It is estimated that the government will have an additional expenditure of approximately 1.5 billion yuan per year, but it is believed that if appropriate measures are taken, even if salaries are raised to pre-war standards or even higher, it is not impossible. They put forward eleven funding suggestions: (1) Eliminate redundant agencies. (2) Eliminate redundant personnel. (3) Reduce special treatment for state-owned enterprises. (4) Eliminate all rations for public educators. (5) Eliminate all subsidies in addition to salaries. (6) Ban dual employment and dual salaries. (7) Verify and issue military pay. (8) Reduce special budget expenditures. (9) Reorganize all public funds and property. (10) Effectively rectify tax collection. (11) Confiscate overseas deposits of corrupt groups. Finally, they questioned whether the Weng Cabinet will abandon its responsibility as a responsible cabinet in the face of the current serious problems.

In the first game of Group A, Chenyou faced Shanghang. Chenyou scored first, and Shanghang immediately retaliated. Afterwards, Chenyou's prowess was fully revealed, with every shot hitting the mark. Shanghang found it difficult to quell their momentum, with Chenyou leading 23 to 16 at halftime. After switching sides, Shanghang launched a fierce counterattack. After 22 to 28, Chenyou adjusted its lineup. Shanghang followed closely, and Liangyou's carelessness forced a score of 32 to 34, with Shanghang only one point behind. Unexpectedly, Shanghang's Shi Ning was sent off for committing five fouls, and Zhou Huaibang replaced him. Chenyou seized the opportunity to attack, and Shanghang lacked defenders, resulting in a sharp drop in score. In the end, Chenyou defeated Shanghang 50 to 34.

At halftime, Lehe led by nine points, 16 to 7.

After the break, Shao Sheng scored on a free throw, Da Zhen scored from long range, and Tian Xiang returned the favor. Lehe called a timeout, and Zhou Zhi pushed in under the basket. Lehe played smoothly, with every shot hitting the mark. Taikang lacked coordination, with sluggish movements, and missed many opportunities. Shao Sheng was sent off for committing five fouls. Lehe's lineup loosened, and Taikang launched an attack. Although they managed to pull back some points, time was up. In the end, they lost to Lehe 26 to 33.

### Small Football Playoff, Yesterday's Game Had No Results

Donghua vs. Yinghang Changed to Friendship Game

The Group A playoff of the Third Small Football League was held at Jinyuan Park at 3:30 p.m. yesterday. In the first half of the game between Zhichao and Nengtou in Group A, Zhichao's Yin Qingbing scored first, taking a 1-0 lead. After changing sides, the battle resumed. Due to overly strict offense and defense, the two sides were difficult to distinguish. Three minutes before the end of the game, Longtou launched a full-scale counterattack. Zhichao was forced into a corner kick. Some spectators suspected it was a nine-yard penalty kick and rushed into the field to beat the referee, causing chaos and making the game impossible to continue, so it was stopped midway. After being suppressed by the authorities, the order of the field was restored to normal. The second game between Donghua and Yanghang then continued to begin, but because it was already late, both sides agreed to change it to a friendly game. Donghua's Chen Mingzhe scored a goal, and Yanghang lost to Donghua 0-1.

Since both games had no results, the original schedule for the total championship semi-final was postponed. The committee will convene another committee meeting next Monday (the 18th) to discuss and then announce.

### Football League's First Shot, Zhichao vs. Tede Postponed

Qingbai vs. Qunli Tomorrow as Usual

They reported the reason to the Football Association. After receiving the notification, the Football Association announced last night: The Tede vs. Zhichao game on the 15th is canceled. The reason for Zhichao's application will be discussed at a meeting. The Qingbai vs. Qunli game tomorrow (the 16th) afternoon will proceed as usual.

### Group C Table Tennis Finals - Ling Yun Eliminates Pudong

Pudong Yong'an to Compete for Third Place Tonight

In the Third Table Tennis League, the second round of the Group C final four teams was held at 7:30 PM the night before last at the Jingzong ball room. Pudong, the top team in Group C2, faced Ling Yun, the second-place team in Group C1. As a result, Ling Yun, fighting valiantly against a weakened opponent, surprisingly eliminated the strong team Pudong with a score of seven to two, securing the right to compete in the Group C finals against Xingguang next Monday (the 17th) for the championship. The match results are recorded below:

(Ling Yun) Score (Pudong)

Zhu Jieshi 21-12 Zhang Jiliang

Wang Weirong 21-15 Zhang Jiliang

Hu Yangshu 14-21 Han Dalun

The referees are Shen Bohong and Dai Yongquan, and the recorder is Chen Jimao. In the Group C2 finals, Yong'an unfortunately lost to Pudong by a score of five. However, the overall strength of the team is stronger than Ling Yun's. Unfortunately, in the first round of the finals the other day, they were惨遭 eliminated by Xingguang, which could be called one loss after another. Tonight, they meet Pudong again, determined to avenge their previous defeat. Pudong has lost the opportunity to win the championship, and their momentum has waned. If they do not invigorate their spirits, it may be difficult to secure victory.

### First Sound of the Football Season - British Warship Draws with China Aviation Team - Sussex's Strength is Mediocre, Each Scores One Goal

The curtain of this year's football season was raised yesterday. The British Navy warship Sussex football team returned from Hong Kong. The Football Committee specially scheduled a friendly match with the China Aviation Football Team at Yiyuan yesterday afternoon at 3 PM. The audience was sparse, only a few hundred people. The entire Northeast Wind Football Team came to watch. The result was a 1-1 draw, with no score in the first half. The referee was Jiang Yinseng, and the linesmen were Wang Chongye and Jin Xibo.

No Score

China Aviation kicked off and had a strong offensive. Fu Zhibin made a solo run, dribbling to the penalty area. He lightly passed to Liu Longyu, but Liu's shot was too weak, and it hit the goalkeeper Pierre. Shortly after, Liu Tishi got the ball and attacked. Pierre rushed out, and Madison chipped the ball towards his own goal, almost creating a comical own goal. The British Navy launched a full-scale attack. Yang Baoluo fouled, and a free kick was awarded at the 20-yard mark. Carter took the kick, and the ball shot out like an arrow. Xu Fusheng dove to save the ball, turning danger into safety. Suddenly, the British right winger Mars advanced along the sideline and made a diagonal shot that missed by only a foot. The first half ended with a score of 0-0.

One Goal Each, Draw

After the break, China Aviation replaced Liang Mingxing with Yuan Liufu, with no other changes. After the restart, the British army launched a fierce attack. The area in front of the China Aviation goal was under constant duress. Fortunately, Xu Fusheng and Zhuang Wenquan resolutely defended their territory, ensuring safety. China Aviation counterattacked, but it was difficult to achieve results. Soon, the British army came again. Right winger Mars had a moment of inspiration and scored the first goal. China Aviation was not willing to give in. The five forwards advanced. Yuan Liufu slipped in front of the goal, missing a good opportunity. Shortly after, Fu Zhibin got the ball and dribbled forward, lightly passing to Liu Longxing. Liu took a shot near the goal, and the British goal was breached, tying the score at 1-1. When time ran out, the two sides shook hands and drew with a score of 1-1. The Football Committee announced: 90 one-yuan tickets and 471 six-jiao tickets were sold yesterday, totaling 372.60 Gold Yuan. The line-ups of the two teams are as follows:

### The Manufacturers of the Feeble-Minded

- Lei Ting

Because I am one of the teachers, I have seen some unreasonable facts in the so-called "purity," so I have a lot of feelings of "speaking my mind."

Now everyone is saying that after the Anti-Japanese War, the level of middle school students has greatly declined, especially in Chinese, English, and Mathematics. This is a fact, but it cannot be said to be a fact only after the war.

Because this is a fact, in newspapers and magazines, you can often read professors' satirical doggerel poems about students, or many examiners' sighs of contempt; in the eyes of some professors or examiners, two not-so-decent words inevitably appear more or less: "Feeble-minded"!

Feeble-minded, do we really have so many feeble-minded young people? Can war create so many feeble-minded young people? This cannot but make people doubt. Because "genius" is indeed rare and valuable, "feeble-minded" is not necessarily everywhere. "Genius" and "feeble-minded" should both be a very small number among a very small number.

Since feeble-mindedness should be as rare as genius, why is it so common now? In my opinion, the formation of this reality should not be blamed on nature, but on nurture; in a word, it is: artificial destruction.

To understand this artificial destruction, we should first face the educational system of our country today.

Because I have been teaching Chinese for a longer time, I might as well talk about the general situation of Chinese professors today, even though this is only one of the three subjects that are generally considered to be of too low a standard.

Before talking about the main topic, I have to spit out a sentence that has been hidden in my heart for a long time: There are too many subjects in middle schools now, too heavy, and too complicated. It is so complicated and heavy that it is not something a middle school student can bear.

In this case, if teachers can find ways to simplify their courses as much as possible, be concise and truly enable students to absorb and digest them, it can still remedy some of the problems. However, most teachers follow the rules and imitate blindly. They are not only unwilling, and disdainful of reform, but also afraid to do so.

For example, let's talk about Chinese again. Most teachers still cling to the remnants of the imperial examination system of selecting talents based on writing, forgetting that today's students are different from the scholars of the past. Therefore, they still adopt the cramming method, trying to stuff many old and dead words and sentences into the minds of young people. Once this is stuffed, even a genius will become feeble-minded.

It goes without saying that the Analects, Mencius, and even Lisao and Shuowen are taught in a chaotic way. Even if it is a national language course, doesn't it include texts from both ancient and modern people? However, teachers seem to have a habit of "always praising Yao and Shun." They mostly value the ancient and despise the modern, despise vernacular and value classical Chinese. They would rather teach an abstract and empty "Record of the Pavilion Where Cranes Are Released" (at least, middle school students should think so), than talk about "Old Lady Nine Catty." They would rather teach a vague and illusory "Preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng" (also the view of middle school students) than read "The receding Figure," which is full of emotion and writing. It is already great if they are willing to let students read it themselves or give them a general overview.

When it comes to composition, students have no opportunity to say their own words. The topics are always "What and what discussion," "What and what what try to elaborate," "On what and what," etc., which make people wonder if this is the Tang or Song Dynasty. The writing must also be in classical Chinese, so the paper is full of "zhi hu zhe ye," and the beginning is "qie fu" and "chang si," which makes people wonder if this is the work of a Qing Dynasty scholar. It can be said that there is simply no opportunity to let students say what they want to say and write what they see or hear. Therefore, students' works are full of empty words and nonsense. You can't hear the current voices of current people. Isn't this intentional to make students become idiots?

In addition, reciting articles, remembering allusions, and writing large and small regular scripts are countless. But remember, the time for Chinese class is six hours per week. If you were the student, could you bear it?

If we think this system is right, then let it go. Fortunately, there are so many feeble-minded people that everyone is feeble-minded. Those who are not feeble-minded are ultimately in the minority. If you want to ridicule or satirize, just ridicule and satirize. Otherwise, we should reform and eliminate this system and the people who manufacture feeble-mindedness!

We do not allow the existence of manufacturers of feeble-mindedness anymore!

### Lotus Temple in Songjiang County Releases Life Pond to Cheng Dui Zhang

- Yao Yuan Chu

In the autumn, the vast plains collect a dream of a hundred miles, a meandering stream believes in clearness, facing the river I see a dam with a level pond, algae are dense, duckweed is deep, fish do not rise; around the pond I faintly recall the beauty of the woods, completely giving it up to clearing and leveling, what is the reason? Green and yellow cattail leaves are mixed with reed thatch, slender white water chestnut flowers are initially budding, the nature of things is truly seen, it is difficult to draw, earnest grass breeds and flourishes, the beautiful cabinet dies! The old scriptures of the Buddhist pavilion, how can one reach them, the lonely broken bridge pillows the stream water, the intention travels and desires to rest, losing the Jing House, the stumbling Shalu rocks are tooth-like. Coming here I hate that it is still too early in the autumn, I do not see the maple leaves dyed red and purple by the frost, looking from afar I am a little happy to point to the cold bamboo, a sheet of evening smoke stretches far away. On the way home I sigh, talking about Zhang (poetry boat), Gu (Qin Chang), the elders of old were elegant, stressing one's native village, the characters from the Daoxian years are far and hard to grasp, the vacant imperial court toils in vain to transcribe the old paper! (Zhang once repaired the county chronicles in the temple)

### Thoughts Inspired by the Suffering of Taking a Bus

- Yi Jun

Taking the tram and public bus, the suffering of the crowding is equal to suffering a crime. Except for those who ride in small cars or exclusively ride pedicabs, no one does not admit this fact. However, what is worth studying is: although the way of taking the bus is extremely evil, crowding passengers to the point of crying out in pain and complaining endlessly, why are there still full buses of people squeezing on to be punished? Thinking about it, one suffers the crime for the sake of life.

The four major items in life, "clothing, food, shelter, and transportation," are all closely related to the matter of taking a bus. Taking a bus is inherently "transportation," and in order to meet the needs of "clothing, food, and shelter," one cannot sit at home and wait for bread, clothes, and houses to fall from the sky. One still has to go outside to participate in work, which requires "transportation," so one needs to take a bus.

People cannot be afraid of suffering in order to live, and have to endure it. For example, before I served society, I generally had a principle when taking a bus, that is, when there were too many people in the bus, I would never get on. What to do? Either walk or wait slowly. Now that I have a job, it's not possible. School starts at 8:15, and I have to rush to school before that time. Suppose I encounter a bus at 7:00, then I can't care whether it's crowded or not, whether I'll suffer or not. I can only ask the gentleman to enter the urn—get on the bus.

Therefore, my conclusion is: generally, people are not afraid of suffering for the sake of life.

Then, I thought again, since people are not afraid of suffering for the sake of life, no wonder there are so many people committing crimes in society. Knowing that committing a crime will be punished, but for the sake of clothing and food, when there is "no way to go to heaven, no door to enter the earth," one can only resort to the path of committing crimes and acting recklessly. This is what I say about the poor.

Then, as for the rich and noble who do not have problems with life, why do they also violate the law? My idea is that the reason is: first, "the rich are unkind." Perhaps their wealth and nobility were originally achieved through "unkind" means. They are already used to being "unkind," how can they suddenly become "kind"! Second, although life is not a problem, the enjoyment of life is limitless. The rich want to be officials, the officials want to be emperors, and the emperors want to be immortals. In order to satisfy higher-level enjoyment, they will naturally not hesitate to violate laws and regulations. Third, those who have money and power are naturally not afraid of anything! To summarize the three points, it is nothing more than for the sake of life, but this life is to enjoy as much as possible.

Therefore, the conclusion here is: for the sake of life, they do not hesitate to commit crimes and are not afraid of punishment.

If we put it this way, does it mean that people who are not afraid of suffering in military service are also not afraid of suffering for committing crimes? No, no, no! The key here mainly lies in personality cultivation. Similarly, they are not afraid of suffering for the sake of life, but those who have personality cultivation are only not afraid of taking the bus; those who have no personality cultivation are not only not afraid of taking the bus, but they also do not care about "going to jail."

### Animal Intelligence

- Zhang Yongjiang

Old horses can recognize the way, cunning rabbits have three burrows. The wisdom of animals is sometimes quite amazing. Once an American man was passing through a desolate prairie in eastern Washington state. He approached a well and almost fell into it. The well was originally a dry well where someone wanted to dig for water but failed to do so. He was temporarily curious, so he lay down on the ground and looked into the well. He saw only darkness inside, about fifteen feet deep. About two feet down from the wellhead, there was a groove one foot deep, recessed into the well wall, spiraling around the well wall like a rifle line inside a gun barrel, leading straight to the bottom of the well. His surprised gaze followed the groove to the dark bottom of the well, where he saw a pair of dead wolves stiffly lying there.

What was going on, he didn't understand at first. Later, after careful speculation, he suddenly realized. It turned out that the spiral groove was not dug down from above, but up from below. After the wolves fell into the well, they couldn't jump out. They felt that the only way to save themselves was to dig a spiral groove along the well wall and climb up from the groove. Dig, fight, work hard, he unswervingly dug upward, and upward. His tens of thousands of footprints showed his labor for many hours or even many days. So, just as he was about to gain freedom, a misstep caused him to fall back down. Perhaps it was because he overestimated his ability and wanted to jump up from the end of the groove two feet below the ground, but his strength was not enough, and he fell repeatedly, suffering serious injuries and dying; perhaps it was because he was hungry for too long, and his strength was exhausted and he could not dig anymore, which led to his death; that is not known. He had engineering knowledge almost on par with humans, but his self-help plan failed. His wisdom is also worth praising.

### Continuing to Discuss Panic Buying

- Ze Shi

If I were a person with a lot of money, I would definitely not rush to buy things, because after having a lot of money, I would not worry about firewood and rice, or worry about freezing or starving to death, but I should cultivate my superior career of mastering four languages, writing beautiful characters, and writing a hundred good poems. If I exchanged gold notes and had an extra three or five hundred yuan that was not very useful (assuming that daily life is maintained by a career), I would also definitely not buy a third-rate suit that is not good-looking to wear for others to see, or a Parker 51 that is definitely not as flavorful to write with as a Zhou Huchen sheep-hair brush, and I would have to worry about pickpockets, or ask my wife to sit in a hair salon and be electrocuted. I would only hire a French teacher with a monthly salary of only twenty yuan, pay him two or three years of tuition at once, and study my second foreign language, or buy a set of Twenty-Four Histories to understand the Chinese nation. This is saying that only I in China or Shanghai have this "idle capital." If seven seas have thousands of people who have it, then things will be done in a more beneficial and self-serving way.

If ten people in our alley have an extra three or five hundred to one or two hundred yuan, and they have no use for it at the moment and are afraid that it will disappear like smoke and clouds, why not take it out to repair our alley road, which is knee-deep in water during heavy rains and rugged and difficult to walk on when the weather is clear, and hire someone to sweep the ground every day? If there is still more, why not plant some trees and flowers?

If hundreds of people on this road have an extra three or five hundred to one or two hundred yuan, why not buy non-urgent or even useless items, but hire a nearby doctor to regularly examine our bodies and treat diseases, and if we have surplus energy, we can revive the poor and sick? Why not send some firewood, rice, oil, and salt to the teachers teaching in the small schools on this road, so that they can be more energetic when teaching and be patient and guide? Why not purchase some books and establish a small community library? Why not install a public telephone for everyone to use?

If we have thousands of people in this area who have three or five hundred yuan to spare and have no use for it, why not combine to run a hospital, run a school, run a nursery, or run a vocational training center for refugees?

If we don't do this, and we only know how to rush to buy useless things when we have a little more money in our pockets, and put them at home to collect dust, feed mice, and raise bookworms, well, one day we will attract ghosts to our door, which will be enough for you to suffer. Above "cultivating one's own moral character," you should know that there are the two words "poverty then"!

The style of buying on consignment is prevalent everywhere, and Beijing is no exception, but it is somewhat different from other places, being relatively more moderate. One reason is that this old capital, with its thick soil and leisurely habits, has always had a calm and composed demeanor, emphasizing "anxious in heart, but not anxious on the face." Even when a major change is imminent, and one is thinking hard about how to deal with it, one will not show the restlessness as much as Shanghai does. During normal periods, the liveliness and prosperity of Beijing are not as good as Tianjin, and Tianjin is not as good as Shanghai. Therefore, the squeezing and rushing, the noisy and chaotic, the busy and disorderly periods of abnormal times will not be as "multi-蜂" and smoky. As shown in the copperplate of the cow-party sleeping on the street published in this newspaper earlier, the scene of rows and rows and lines and lines of "sardines," and the strategy of occupying land to buy "Wowo", Tianjin has been infected, but Beijing has not yet learned to walk. Queueing is all there is. Now Pingjin also spreads the name of the Cow-party, which is said to have originated from the Shanghai school. There has always been similar behavior in the north, but no such term. Whenever a run or rush buying occurs, most of those who occupy numbers and queue are not the main owners. Some people are employed everywhere, or go to the door to inquire, or wander outside the line store, or use small capital to buy ration tickets with discounts, or poor men and women take their wages to buy on behalf of others to stand in line, suffering the cold, wind and frost, in exchange for rewards. (This is called "work money", with women being the majority, because women are more likely to get the sympathy of "the person in the counter in the house", giving them priority over men.) This trend has existed since the bank runs in the early years of the Republic of China.

Now the stores on the streets are desolate and desolate, especially the oil, salt, grain, rice, and daily necessities stores. The door is posted with "fragrant oil has been sold out", "large salt has been exhausted", soy sauce, cooking wine, and noodles, all kitchen supplies, do not say no sale, nor say out of stock, only say "sold out." Even if you rush there early in the morning, they will say: Someone came earlier than you to rush buy them. In fact, they have already moved people elsewhere, and the shelves are empty. Beijing merchants, seeing signs of a rush to buy, quickly store their goods away, and their sharp eyes and quick hands to respond to opportunities are still the usual skills of "Old Beijing." Even if an acquaintance comes to the counter to buy, they will run into a snag. (Although they are not difficult for acquaintances, they are afraid that the official plainclothes people will see them and get into trouble, so even very close acquaintances must deliver the goods to their homes at night, and not sell them as a transaction, achieving the word "black market" to the fullest.) Therefore, the trend of rush buying of daily necessities has become a thing of the past in a very short time. Now it is just a cold front door, empty shelves and quiet people. The shopkeeper and shop assistants face each other "meditating". If there are buyers who inquire, they smile and shake their heads. The buyer also smiles and reciprocates, always so lazy and humble!

Social Services Reader's Letters

### Identity Card is Not Issued for a Long Time, Daily Necessities Cannot be Purchased, Hope Relevant Authorities Will Improve Quickly

Editor: I recently read in the newspapers that citizens of this city purchase goods with their national identity cards, or issue purchase permits based on their identity cards. The method is very good, but it seems to lack perfection, because some citizens of this city have not yet received their national identity cards. Like me, I have been in Shanghai for less than two months. Although the identity card has been requested from the Bao Office to be reported for verification, I have not received it yet. In this case, we have no right to purchase daily necessities. But we cannot be without these items for a day. Regarding this point, the authorities in charge of rationing have probably considered remedies to benefit the citizens. In my opinion, before the identity card is requested but not received, the Bao Office should temporarily issue a temporary certificate, which has the same validity as the identity card. Only in this way can the rationing system be implemented smoothly and without obstacles. In addition, it is also hoped that the Civil Affairs Bureau, the District Office, the Baojia Chief, should strive for speed in terms of procedures, and do not delay for a long time before issuing them, as in the past, which is what the public expects. Zhang Zhaoqi, a civil servant in this city, reports.
