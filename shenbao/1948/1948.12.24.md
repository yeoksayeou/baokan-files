### President Sun Explains Policy Guidelines: Self-Reliance to Maintain National Survival; War is Not Unilaterally Abandoned; Military Force Still Seeks Peace; Improving Systems to Reduce People's Suffering

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] President Sun, in his first address to the Executive Yuan meeting after taking office, stated the following:

My appointment as President of the Executive Yuan is akin to being drafted into military service. At this critical stage of national hardship, many important and difficult national problems urgently need to be resolved. Only by braving dangers and difficulties, and humbly accepting this arduous task, can I hope that my colleagues will be of one heart and mind, working together for the country to overcome difficulties, sharing the President's burdens, and reversing this difficult situation.

The suppression of the rebellion is currently at a crucial stage. The government's ultimate goal in using military force is to strive for peace. Whether it was the war of resistance against foreign aggression in the past or the current use of force internally, the goal remains the same. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the government made efforts to pursue peace. Because peace could not be achieved, it was compelled to use force. The ultimate goal of using force is still to seek the restoration of peace. However, war is a matter for both sides and cannot be unilaterally abandoned. The government cannot rely on foreign forces to support its internal affairs. Maintaining the survival of the nation requires its own conditions. At this stage, how to strengthen the government's power and maintain national survival is something we should all focus our efforts on, carefully plan, and strive to achieve.

Speaking of diplomacy, China's international environment is more complex and turbulent than it was three years ago. After the War of Resistance, due to the failure to achieve peaceful unification domestically, it has been impossible to focus on construction. China's declining international status is also far worse than it was three years ago. China's national policy has always been to coexist peacefully with any country in the world. For existing friendships, we will strive to strengthen them. If there are misunderstandings, we are also willing to work hard to resolve them amicably. This is the spirit of our nation and the basic principle of our diplomacy. It has been so in the past, and it will continue to be so in the future.

Because of the eight years of the War of Resistance against foreign aggression and the three years of internal turmoil, the people are impoverished, and resources are exhausted, productivity has declined sharply, and the nation's vitality has been severely damaged. During the period of military conflict, the national treasury's expenditures were enormous, leading to currency instability and rising prices. Everyone has experienced this vicious cycle. In addition, there are many aspects of the currently used laws and systems that urgently need to be improved. For example, the conscription system of the past ten years or more, which was used to support the eight-year war, did achieve considerable results. However, as it has been continued for a long time, the misconduct of personnel and the unreasonableness of the methods have intensified, the burden on the people has become heavy, and the country has not benefited much. In the future, in terms of administration, this system should be carefully reviewed and effectively improved to reduce the burden and suffering of the people.

As for financial problems, the root lies in the social economy. Although it is difficult to expect domestic agricultural and industrial production to increase, at least we cannot let it decline further. Only then can the sources of revenue on which the country's survival depends have a foundation. Otherwise, finance and the economy will inevitably worsen together. Therefore, rewarding and assisting the development of agriculture, industry, and mining should be the most urgent task of national governance in the future.

In terms of local administration, there are also many unreasonable phenomena. In the past, the government focused on establishing a system, such as the accounting and auditing systems and the procedures for handling official documents. The trivial drawbacks often made administrative procedures cumbersome, stagnant, and delayed, greatly reducing efficiency. These must be improved. In the past, local government officials generally felt that the central government was too centralized, and everything had to be decided by the central government. Sometimes, requests were made but no response was received for a long time, resulting in delays in important matters. This centralized system may be sustainable in normal times, but in extraordinary situations, many local problems must be resolved on the spot to adapt to the situation and not miss opportunities. In recent years, foreign public opinion has often expressed dissatisfaction with Chinese politics, mainly due to personnel corruption and political inefficiency. Orders from higher-level governments cannot be implemented at the lower levels, forming a phenomenon of concealment between superiors and subordinates. These accusations are not entirely fabricated. Because of these various problems, the country is in its current difficult situation. In the future, we must do our best to frankly correct and boldly improve. Only with progress in politics can the country have vitality. However, these problems cannot be solved by the President of the Executive Yuan alone. Therefore, I must sincerely ask all my colleagues to make a joint decision and strive to shoulder their responsibilities to solve all the urgent problems of today. This is what I deeply hope for.

After Sun arrived, he immediately held a handover ceremony with the Weng cabinet.

Immediately afterward, the first government affairs meeting was held. Sun made a report similar to an explanation of the major policies, clarifying the tasks of the current cabinet. After the report, routine cases were discussed, and cases such as the appointment of Teng Jie as the Mayor of Beijing were passed. The meeting then adjourned.

The candidates for deputy ministers of various departments and deputy chairmen of various committees have not yet been fully decided. However, since Minister of Education Mei Yi-qi is still firmly declining the position, and the ministry's affairs need to be handled, his political deputy will be announced soon, with Chen Xueping appointed to act on behalf of the minister. It is also learned that the new candidate for the position of Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan has not yet been finalized.

### Wang Shijie May Be Appointed Ambassador to Britain

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] Wu Tiecheng, who concurrently serves as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, will arrive at the ministry within days to take over his duties. Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Shijie has been handling official duties as usual in recent days, preparing for the handover. Regarding the direction of the new cabinet's foreign policy, relevant parties here are mostly adopting a reserved attitude and refraining from speculation. Some say that Minister Wu's concurrent position is temporary and that there will not be any major changes for the time being. The final decision will be made after a full-time Minister of Foreign Affairs is officially appointed, the matter is discussed and drafted by the Executive Yuan, and it is submitted to the President for approval. As for the rumors in Beijing that former Minister Wang will be appointed as ambassador to Britain, people close to him say that it is not entirely impossible.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] Sun Ke's letter of resignation as President of the Legislative Yuan was delivered to the Secretariat of the Yuan on the 23rd and will be presented for report at the 31st Yuan meeting on the 24th. The original text of the resignation letter is as follows: "Respectfully, I, Sun Ke, have been in charge of the affairs of the Legislative Yuan for seventeen years. This summer, with the implementation of constitutional government, the Yuan was reorganized, and I was able to gather with my colleagues again to jointly plan the country's affairs, thereby establishing laws and systems, laying the foundation for the initial stage of democracy, conveying public sentiment, and establishing a model for constitutional government. At the end of last month, I was ordered to organize a new cabinet, deeply grateful for the consent of my colleagues. However, considering my ailing body, I fear I cannot withstand the arduous task and have repeatedly requested to resign, but my request has not been granted. I can only do my best and strive to fulfill my duties. Now that the new cabinet has been formed, I hereby resign from my original position as President of this Yuan. I hope that the two Yuans will need each other, complement each other, and work together seamlessly, adhering to the principle of collective wisdom and effort, and achieving the goal of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. This is not only my sincere prayer. Respectfully submitted to all members of the Legislative Yuan for your consideration, Sun Ke."

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] With the President and Vice President of the Legislative Yuan taking positions as government officials, the vacant positions will be filled by the Legislative Yuan members re-electing each other. It is learned that the resignations of Sun Ke and Chen Lifu will be reported at the regular meeting on the 24th, and the date of the re-election will also be decided at the meeting.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 23rd] In order to ensure the cultural ancient city and stabilize the war situation in North China, the councils of seven provinces and cities in North China jointly telegraphed the central government for assistance and requested clear instructions on the decision-making for the war situation in North China.

### The Communist Bandits in Northern Huai Have No Strength to Flee South; National Army Du Yuming's Troops Launch Offensive

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] A comprehensive analysis by military personnel of the current quiet war situation in northern Huai states that the northern Huai battlefield has three combat zones. First, in the Shuangduiji area, Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng encircled Huang Wei's corps. Huang's corps ended its breakout on the 16th. Liu and Chen's forces also suffered severe losses. If these two bandit units are not replenished, it will be difficult for them to launch another southern attack. Second, Chen Yi's bandit forces besieged the Qiu and Li corps led by Du Yuming in the Qinglongji area between Xiao and Yong. It has been 23 days since then, and they have not been able to eliminate these two major corps. Moreover, they have suffered heavy losses in attacking fortifications. Although the battlefield has been shrouded in continuous bad low clouds for four days, the air force and civil aviation team still dispatched food and ammunition by air, supporting Du's corps. With the existence of Du's corps, Chen Yi's main force is being consumed daily and has no strength to flee south. Third, the bandits who are blocking Li Yannian's corps from going north have not received reinforcements from Liu and Chen after the end of the Shuangduiji battle. A southern attack is out of the question. Looking at the northern Huai front as a whole, the quiet situation due to Liu and Chen's inability to advance south will continue until around the New Year. Although Wuhe and Xuyi on the eastern end of the northern Huai line are unstable areas, they are not as severely harassed by local communists as the areas in northern Jiangsu. Army troops have been firmly defending bunkers and rushing to search and suppress them under the intrusion of wind, snow, and mud in recent days without the slightest slackening.

### Only Eight Ports Open in Jiangbei; All Other Ports Are Prohibited from Navigation and Berthing; The Market Gradually Prospers After Gaoyou Is Recovered

All unnecessary ships will be driven to the south of the Yangtze River to prevent the communist army from using them for smuggling. In addition, the Navy and Water Police will implement control. Open ports are absolutely prohibited from navigation outside of 7:00 am to 5:00 pm. This plan will be implemented within days.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 23rd] There is no worry about the defense of the Yangtze River in Zhenjiang. The 49 surveillance posts set up by the authorities in the coastal area have now been completed, and the heads of coastal towns have been ordered to earnestly carry out their watch duties.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 23rd] Confirmed information: Since the national army moved into Gaoyou, the post office has begun to operate, and the town postal liners have been sailing daily, and the market is gradually prospering.

### Ministry of National Defense Announces Weekly War Situation; Morale of the People in Beiping and Tianjin is Uplifted; New Jianghuai Station Headquarters Will Be Completed

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Ministry of National Defense today announced the weekly war situation from the 16th to the 22nd as follows: (1) North China Battlefield: Since Lin Biao's bandit forces from the Northeast sneaked into Guannei, our national army in North China has made timely and strict deployments, concentrating its forces in the Beiping, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou areas to build up strength and prepare to inflict heavy damage on the attacking bandits. Since the 14th, after launching tentative harassment in the western suburbs of Beiping, the national army took the initiative to send teams to attack on the 16th and 17th. On the 17th alone, it killed or wounded more than 1,700 bandits from the 5th Column near Wanshou Temple, Hongguoyuan, and Baishiqiao in the northwest of the city. Another national army force that attacked Mayuqiao in the southeast of Beiping also killed or wounded more than 2,000 bandits from the 8th Column from morning to noon. The national army in Nanyuan annihilated all 300 bandits who sneaked into the airport. Since then, the suburbs of Beiping have been generally peaceful, and the fighting has been limited to sporadic contact. However, the bandit army blindly fired artillery at the ancient city at night to expand its psychological warfare to shake people's hearts. Several residents were injured in the Dagou, Xiaogongjiangying, and Donggongjiangying areas inside Fuchengmen. The Beiping people were all resentful of the bandit army's inhumanity and blind shelling. In recent days, our artillery and air force have coordinated to exert their power, and the bandit artillery has been suppressed. Currently, there are no main bandit forces within 15 kilometers of the suburbs of Beiping.

Failing to succeed in attacking the suburbs of Beiping, the bandits launched an attack on the morning of the 20th on Dabizhuang, Yixingbu in the northeast of Tianjin, and Tianqimiao in the northwest. The national army gave them a head-on blow, and the bandits retreated across the board after suffering heavy losses in the fierce fighting until 2 p.m. The bandits were wiped out up to more than 2,000. The bandits who sneaked into Xinhe, west of Tanggu, were also repelled by our army, with more than 1,000 bandits killed or wounded. In the evening, the bandits gathered again to attack, and after fierce counterattacks by the national army on all fronts, the bandits could not support and retreated, killing or wounding another 1,500 bandits. There was still fighting in northern Tianjin on the 21st, but the bandit offensives were repelled by the national army several times. Only a small group of bandits harassed the area south of Junliangcheng. Now that the airports in the cities of Beiping and Tianjin have been completed, air transport can be restored, and the morale of the people is more uplifted than before.

(2) East China Battlefield: The Bengbu-Su County Battle, which began on November 26th, lasted until December 16th, when our Huang Wei and Li Yannian corps met, exactly 20 days. During these 20 days, our Huang Wei Corps used Shuangduiji and Dayingji southwest of Su County as bases, absorbing more than 100,000 bandits from Liu's 1st, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 10th Columns, and Chen Geng's 9th Column between the Bei Fei River and the Hui River, making it impossible for them to escape the battlefield. Li's corps entered Fangdianzi after crossing Baojiaji, and met with Huang Wei's corps attacking from Shuangduiji. The first to defeat the bandit's deep trench positions and shake hands with the vanguard of Li's corps were General Hu Lian and the soldiers of the 18th Division led by General Yin Jun. Our Huang Wei Corps fought hard for more than ten days. Although there were some losses, the bandit casualties were even heavier than ours compared with the bandit army. At present, villages stretching for hundreds of miles around Mengcheng and Woyang are filled with wounded soldiers. It can be said that the sacrifices of our loyal and brave officers and soldiers have been greatly rewarded. After the meeting of the Huang and Li corps, most of the bandit army retreated one after another to reorganize. Recently, due to cloudy and rainy weather, all lines have been quiet. In addition to making perfect deployments and seeking to give the bandits a fatal blow, the national army is also using powerful troops to clear the remaining bandits between the Fei and Hai rivers before launching an offensive towards Guzhen and Mengcheng to coordinate with the southern army of Du Yuming, which has been fighting fiercely with the bandits for half a month between Yongcheng and Su County. As of now, during the 20 days of the Bengbu-Su County Battle, we have killed or wounded more than 159,000 bandits and captured more than 7,260 bandits. The Chen and Liu bandit forces, after being hit by this, are frantically seeking replenishment by pulling up conscripts in Yubei, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu. They are also transferring militia and military region troops from Jiaodong and northwestern Yubei to incorporate them into the defeated columns. Currently, all counties in Yubei, such as Mengcheng, Woyang, and those north of Hongze Lake, are filled with wounded bandit soldiers, so there will be no major rash actions in the short term. At the same time, the new deployment of our powerful national army defending Jianghuai is about to be completed.

### Editorial: Upholding Justice, Truth Endures

—On the Execution by Hanging of War Criminals Like Tojo

Tokyo, MacArthur Headquarters, 23rd morning announced: Japanese Class A war criminals Tojo Hideki, Doihara Kenji, Hirota Koki, Itagaki Seishiro, Kimura Heitaro, Matsui Iwane, and Umezu Yoshijiro, seven in total, were all executed by hanging between 00:00 and 00:35 on the 23rd at Sugamo Prison. General MacArthur specially invited representatives from the Allied Control Council for Japan, including those from the Soviet Union, the United States, China, and Australia, to attend the execution. Chinese General Shang Zhen was also among them. Upon receiving this news, the world was thrilled, especially the Chinese people who suffered eight years of invasion and devastation under the Japanese militarists, who breathed a deep sigh of relief. Without a doubt, this is a major event of 1948, a clear indication that the truth of the human world, despite twists and turns, ultimately triumphs. Robert E. Kintner, the chief prosecutor for the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, stated in Washington D.C.: He hoped the hanging of the seven Japanese war criminals would mark the beginning of an international ban on wars of aggression. Indeed, we unanimously believe that the death of Tojo and others is the death of violence, the death of might, and the death of aggression; its historical significance is profoundly worthy of human cherishment.

First, the hanging of Tojo and others demonstrates the upholding of justice and the enduring nature of truth in the human world. The organization of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo was larger than the Nuremberg trials, lasting more than two years and costing 20 million US dollars. It presented 5,597 pieces of evidence, heard 435 witnesses, and compiled over 50,000 pages of records, all more comprehensive and substantial than the Nuremberg trials. The trial concluded on April 16th, and the court adjourned. The date for sentencing, initially scheduled for six weeks, was delayed for seven months until November 13th, when Tojo and six others were sentenced to death by hanging, Araki and sixteen others were sentenced to life imprisonment, and Shigemitsu Mamoru and one other were sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term. During this period, there were numerous twists and delays. Our country's judge, Mei Ru'ao, also acknowledged that this slow and sluggish trial had almost lost its political significance. On November 24th, MacArthur approved the above verdict, and it was generally estimated that the execution would be carried out soon. However, new twists occurred. The American defense lawyers for Doihara and others appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court on November 29th, requesting their release. Unexpectedly, the Supreme Court accepted the appeal and prepared for a new review. Public opinion was in an uproar, unanimously dissatisfied with the U.S. Supreme Court's acceptance of the case, and even MacArthur was surprised. Finally, on the 20th of this month, the U.S. Supreme Court, by a vote of six to one, decided to reject the appeal of the Japanese war criminals. Thereupon, MacArthur, with swiftness, executed these seven heinous war criminals by hanging on the morning of the 23rd. The twists and turns of this event demonstrate the shameful attempts of the violent to survive; they sought to preserve their lives through various loopholes, escaping the judgment of justice and the punishment of truth. However, their crimes were unforgivable, and all their shameful efforts ultimately failed and were shattered. Today's world is one where violence and justice, might and righteousness clash. The moment of light that appeared in the dawn of the 23rd symbolizes the upholding of justice and the enduring nature of truth in the human world.

Second, the U.S. Supreme Court's decisive rejection of the appeal of the Japanese war criminals demonstrates the sacred dignity of American law. Law is the belief and opinion of the public. When the war criminals' defense lawyers appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, their reasons stated that MacArthur had no authority to establish a military tribunal to judge them and that no American legislative body or international law stipulated the crime of aggression. They declared that if the military tribunal decided to retry the case, they did not intend to attend the U.S. Supreme Court. This clearly hoped that the U.S. Supreme Court would rule for a retrial of the case and even attempt to overturn the verdict of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. After Hirota and Doihara filed the above appeals, Shimada Shigetaro, Oka Takasumi, Sato Kenryo, Togo Shigenori, Kido Koichi, and others also successively filed appeals, nearly shaking the sacred verdict. At this critical and final moment, if the U.S. Supreme Court had made a misjudgment, the regrets of a thousand autumns would have been irreparable, the entire history of justice would have been destroyed, and the world would have lost its light. World public opinion, including the consciousness of the U.S. government, stood up unanimously to prevent this misperception of the U.S. Supreme Court. On the 20th, the U.S. Supreme Court finally rejected the appeal of the Japanese war criminals through a vote. The U.S. Supreme Court's acceptance of the appeal was initially a mistake, but this mistake was immediately corrected, which fully demonstrates the sacred dignity of American law, worthy of praise. As for the clear and powerful global public opinion, suppressing might, resisting violence, and punishing aggression, its spirit will forever exist, and the concept of right and wrong is unbreakable. We wish that the laws of the human world, with the passage of time, will always be clear and powerful, developing from the power of law into the power of political morality, forever punishing violence, resisting might, and punishing aggression, so that all those who use violence, those who wield power, and those who commit aggression will be completely destroyed and completely die before the fairness and justice of the human world.

Correction: In yesterday's editorial, the word "非" (not) was omitted from the fourth line in the sentence "此不可謂孫氏之成功" (This cannot be said to be Sun's success). It should read "此不可謂非孫氏之成功" (This cannot be said *not* to be Sun's success). We hereby urgently correct this.

### Political Affairs Meeting Decides: Temporary Suspension of Gold and Silver Exchange; Deposit and Exchange Policy Remains Unchanged, Separate Improved Measures to Be Devised

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Due to deposit exchanges for gold and silver, runs on banks have occurred in various places, and deaths have resulted from people being crushed. In order to maintain local order and protect the safety of the people, the Executive Yuan decided on the 23rd to instruct the Central Bank to temporarily suspend exchanges from today onwards and to devise separate improved measures. On the 23rd, during the first political affairs meeting of the new Executive Yuan, Premier Sun received a long-distance call from Shanghai Mayor Wu Guozhen, reporting that the exchange of gold and silver had caused chaotic order in Shanghai, resulting in the deaths of several people being crushed, and requesting instructions on how to handle the situation. After Premier Sun reported this to the political affairs meeting, it was decided that the policy of deposit exchanges for gold and silver would remain unchanged, but in order to avoid runs on banks and prevent further loss of life, exchanges would be temporarily suspended. The Ministry of Finance was instructed to work with the Central Bank to draft proper measures before resuming deposit exchanges. After the political affairs meeting adjourned, Central Bank Governor Yu Hongjun immediately notified Central Bank branches in various locations that all current deposit and exchange measures would be temporarily suspended until the new measures were announced.

### Heinous Murder Case Occurs in Rural Mudu, Suzhou

Two Dead, Two Injured; Case Complicated

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 23rd] Yesterday, a murder case resulting in two deaths and two injuries occurred in Nanxie Village, Mudu. Coffin maker Lü Genquan sold five shi of grain soil due to gambling debts, leading to an argument with his wife, Lü Quanjin. In a drunken rage, he used a sharp axe to kill his mother-in-law, Lü Yunbao. He then repeatedly slashed his wife sixteen times, leaving her life in critical condition. His younger sister-in-law, Qiu Yuan, sustained minor injuries. Afterwards, he fatally stabbed himself in the throat with an iron chisel. It is rumored that this was a crime of passion, as Lü had learned that his mother-in-law and wife were both having affairs with a tailor, leading him to commit the heinous act. However, there was a bloody handprint on the screen wall outside the house, and a clump of cotton yarn stained with blood was found in the grass across the river. The case appears to be extremely complicated, and the police bureau is currently investigating.

Central News Agency, Hong Kong: Hong Kong Governor Grantham introduced a bill in the Legislative Council to establish a joint volunteer defense force. It passed its third reading on the afternoon of the 22nd and has become law.

Corrigendum—In yesterday's edition, page 7, the passage after "to protect Hong Kong" at the end of line fifty-six of the article "Hong Kong Organizes Defense Force" was mistakenly printed after the seventh line of the "Diet" subheading in the third column of the article "The Lives of the British People." The passage after "perhaps the rise of all prices after the war" at the end of the seventh line of the "Diet" subheading in the third column of the article "The Lives of the British People" is actually the full text of the article "Hong Kong Organizes Defense Force" from the fifty-seventh line onwards until the end (the "Hardship" subheading). We hereby correct this.

### Supervisory Committee's Censure Against Yangzi Corporation (Continued from Yesterday)

(4) Regarding Western medicines, there are 2,763 boxes, totaling 188 varieties. Key and large quantity medicines are excerpted as follows: (1) Cod liver oil: 19,002 bottles, (2) Cod liver oil essence: 8,148 bottles, (3) Cod liver oil essence pills: 13,390 bottles, (4) Xiaofa Da Jing pills: 13,164 bottles, (5) Xiaofa Wei Jing pills: 48 bottles, (6) Xiaofa Suppository pills: 2,618 bottles, (7) Xiaofa Pidings pills: 872 bottles, (8) Glucose calcium injection: 3,623 bottles, (9) Glucose injection: 11,628 bottles, (10) Glucose calcium tablets: 302 bottles, (11) Multivitamins: 16,378 bottles, (12) Vitamin: 2,403 bottles, (13) Daily vitamin pills: 2,160 bottles, (14) Weixin injection: 2,722 tubes, (15) Weixin tablets: 5,679 bottles, (16) Weikang pills: 4,020 bottles, (17) Weimaike completed: 7,379 bottles, (18) Ultraviolet fat: 7,712 bottles, (19) Vitamin phosphate pills: 982 bottles, (20) Vitamin mineral pills: 6,408 bottles, (21) Vitamin mineral tablets: 2,054 bottles, (22) Weipei tablets: 4,800 bottles, (23) Wheat germ oil pills: 600 bottles, (24) Yeast tablets: 3,641 bottles, (25) Yeast vitamin D tablets: 80,573 bottles, (26) Magnetic bottle quinine tablets: 48 bottles, (27) Qingna biscuit tablets: 140 bottles, (28) Calcium lactate tablets: 558 bottles, (29) Bita tablets: 1,431 bottles, (30) Compound white pine syrup: 219 gallons and 768 pints, (31) Wild cherry bark syrup: 119 gallons and 384 pints, (32) RXB syrup: 46,872 bottles, (33) Barbital tablets: 2,436 bottles, (34) Junluocaine injection: 1,020 bottles, (35) Sun Kelu tablets: 5,040 bottles.

(5) There are 44 other types of goods, and the ones with large quantities are also excerpted as follows: (1) Printing press: 28 boxes, (2) Cement pipe manufacturing machines: 30 boxes, (3) Syringes: 1,265, (4) Carbon paper: 19 boxes, (5) Printing ink: 25 boxes, (6) Paper clips: 780 reams, (7) Bicycle wheels: 914, (8) Bicycles: 9 boxes (6 bicycles per box), (9) Large cardboard for walls: 191 and a half boxes and 211 sheets, (10) Suits: 44, (11) Ties: 1,187, (12) Wool socks: 98, (13) Counterweight: 298 pieces, (14) Sewing thread: 1 box, (15) Wireless light bulbs: 2 boxes.

During the investigation of the above items, discrepancies were found. For example, 1,167 pairs of women's shorts listed in the original table were not found. It was pointed out that they were glass combs with 15,994 dozens. It was claimed that the women's shorts had been sent to the company for sale but were not recorded, and the glass combs were inadvertently omitted. The original report listed 38 barrels plus 379 pounds of gold powder, but the current stock is 32 barrels and 379 pounds. It was claimed that six barrels had been sold after the report was filed. There were also 44 summer clothes packed in a large wooden box that Zhu failed to report. In addition, some items listed by Song were identified as goods in storage or shared warehouses. On the second floor of the Li Han Company, there were six large wooden boxes, each over ten feet long, containing thick glass panels, which were said to be stored by Xiangji Company. There were 24 machine pedal cars packed in 24 wooden boxes, which were said to be stored by Zhongxing Automobile Factory. Inside the Datongwan Road warehouse, there were 245 rolls of white newsprint 35 inches wide and 89 rolls 70 inches wide, which were said to belong to the Dalu News. There were also 283 rolls of white newsprint (21.5 inches) wide, 109 rolls 31.5 inches wide, and 74 rolls 13 inches wide, which were identified as belonging to the Shishi News. At that time, no evidence was presented to prove that the so-called stored items or shared warehouses were indeed stored or co-owned by all parties.

Secondly, it is difficult to understand the truth of whether the import of goods is legal, whether there is concealment, and whether there are cases of swapping labels, because the company did not submit the goods in/out ledgers and all important documents for review. However, even with this cursory verification, there are still major problems. For example, a batch of glass raincoats, glass toothbrushes, glass handbags, and silk summer clothes, which were prohibited from import, was reported to have been imported on May 22 this year. However, checking the tax payment customs declaration number, it was found that they were another batch of the same goods imported in July and August of the thirty-fifth year. For goods that are temporarily not allowed to be imported, 744 silk raincoats were reported to have been imported on May 23 this year, but the tax receipt number was verified to be another batch of the same goods imported on August 8 of the thirty-fifth year. 306 fountain pens were also another batch of the same goods imported on August 1 of the thirty-fifth year. In addition, 6 boxes of wool fabrics imported on July 25 of the thirty-sixth year, 994 insurance razors imported on October 26, and 1,983 pairs of rubber shoes imported on December 15, were verified to be another batch of the same goods imported on November 4, September 15, and October 31 of the thirty-sixth year. This is only with regard to goods that are prohibited or temporarily not allowed to be imported. As for other items such as DDT powder, the customs declaration only shows 48 barrels, while the company reported 70 barrels. (To be continued)

### We Support the U.S. Proposal in the Security Council to Order the Netherlands to Cease Fire and Withdraw Troops; Australian Representative Vehemently Argues for Expelling the Netherlands from the United Nations; The Soviet Union May Demand Sanctions

[Our Report] Paris, 23rd Broadcast: Seven member states of the United Nations, namely China, the United States, India, the Philippines, Australia, the Soviet Union, and Syria, unanimously condemned the Netherlands' actions in Indonesia. Soviet Representative Malik demanded that the Security Council condemn the Netherlands' aggression against Indonesia as a threat to international peace. Australian Representative Hodgson proposed amending the U.S. proposal in the Security Council to demand that the Dutch government immediately release Indonesian leaders. At the Security Council meeting in the afternoon, Syrian Representative Curry formally introduced the amendment.

[Associated Press, Paris, 22nd] Soviet Representative Malik is scheduled to speak in the Security Council on the 23rd. According to those familiar with the Soviet Union's attitude, if the Soviet Union proposes a draft resolution, it will likely classify the Netherlands' offensive as a threat to peace and may even demand sanctions against the Netherlands.

[United Press, Paris, 23rd] Australian Representative Hodgson today asked the Security Council to expel the Netherlands from the United Nations unless the Netherlands ceases its attacks on the Indonesian Republic. Today is the second day of the Security Council's discussion of the Indonesian issue. Chinese Representative Hsia Chin-lin was the first to declare his support for the proposal made yesterday by U.S. Representative Jessup to order the Netherlands to cease fire and withdraw troops immediately. Colombia and Syria also expressed their support. Hodgson also echoed this proposal, but with a more vehement attitude. It is said that Article 25 of the United Nations Charter stipulates that any member state should accept and implement the orders of the Security Council, but the Netherlands has blatantly torn up the Security Council's ceasefire order, and the only way for the Security Council to deal with it is to expel the Netherlands from the United Nations.

[United Press, Paris, 22nd] U.S. Representative Jessup today requested the United Nations Security Council to order a ceasefire in Indonesia, with the Dutch troops returning to their original defense positions, and for the United Nations Mediation Committee to investigate the responsibility for initiating the conflict. Jessup clearly announced: "The U.S. government cannot condone any excuse for the resumption of hostilities in Indonesia." The Mediation Committee's report has pointed out six Dutch offenses, including violating the ceasefire agreement and issuing an ultimatum to Indonesia.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 22nd] The Indonesian representative today defended the Indonesian Republic at the Security Council meeting this afternoon, stating: "This is the second Pearl Harbor incident." He also criticized the Security Council for not taking action, which is tantamount to encouraging the Dutch to decide to take military action. The Indonesian representative accused the Netherlands of imposing penalties on the people of the Republic and suppressing the Republic's economy. The Indonesian issue is not a threat of war, but an actual war. He urged the Security Council to work to stop the war immediately, otherwise the war will continue for many years until Indonesia regains its freedom from the Netherlands. He also requested that the Netherlands release the detained Indonesian ministers. The Indonesian representative also requested the Security Council to take action outside of the Indonesian Mediation Committee, as the committee is in an isolated position and it is difficult to complete the task of peacefully resolving the dispute.

### U.S. Government Carefully Considering Stopping All Aid to the Netherlands; Indonesia Has Urged Lovett to Implement Immediately

[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] Well-informed sources said on the 23rd that the administration is carefully considering suspending all aid to the Netherlands under the Marshall Plan as a further action to force the Dutch troops to withdraw from Indonesia. The Economic Cooperation Administration had already announced on the 21st that it would suspend the Marshall Plan aid to the Dutch East Indies pending clarification of the situation in Indonesia.

[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] Indonesian Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Soemitro Djojohadikoesoemo, declared at a press conference on the 22nd that the United States' refusal to allocate economic aid funds to the Dutch East Indies is a full expression of the U.S. attitude. Mr. Soemitro said: "I hope that the Economic Cooperation Administration will also suspend all allocations to the Netherlands in the same way." Without the funds of the Economic Cooperation Administration, the Netherlands will not be able to maintain its current military operations in the East Indies. He said: "I personally urged Mr. Lovett to suspend all allocations to the Netherlands during the meeting."

### Countries of錫印澳 Discontinue Cooperation with Holland

Mr. Su stated: Indonesia also hopes to obtain assistance from other Asian countries. He said: "I have announced that Ceylon has refused to lend money to the Netherlands, as has the Australian Labour Union. I hope that India will also take strict action. Today I will meet with senior Indian officials in New York." He said: He will also ask the governments of Egypt and Pakistan to revoke port and aviation facilities for Dutch ships and aircraft. The Prime Minister of Burma has called on other Asian countries to convene a meeting to support the Republic of Indonesia.

### France and Italy Sympathize with the Netherlands, Suspect American Attitude

Questioning Whether the US Has Changed its Anti-Communist Policy

[Central News Agency, Paris, 22nd] The firm attitude of the United States towards the conflict in Indonesia has made the French suspect whether the United States has now changed its overall policy of dealing with communism. It is believed here that the sudden change in US policy is related to the opposition to the independence movements of the people in the East and West colonies and the precarious position of China.

### Economic Cooperation with the Netherlands, Funding Has Not Stopped

[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] The Economic Cooperation Administration announced today that it would allocate 547,000 US dollars to the Netherlands for the purchase of oil cakes and meat in the US and fodder and leather in Latin America. Previously, the agency obtained approval from the State Department to stop aiding the Dutch East Indies in order to combat the Dutch military operations against the Republic of Indonesia.

### Indonesian Army Launches Counterattack in Two Areas of Eastern Java; New Defensive Line Built North of Yogyakarta

[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] Indonesian Republic representative Sumitro said tonight that Indonesian troops had launched a counterattack in Cibinong and Mojokerto in eastern Java, and riots had also occurred behind the Dutch lines in western Java.

[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 22nd] Republican troops had already built a defensive line and fortifications on the southern slope of Mount Merapi, 30 kilometers north of Yogyakarta.

[United Press, Batavia, 22nd] According to Indonesian radio, fierce battles are still going on inside and outside Yogyakarta City.

[Associated Press, Batavia, 23rd] The Dutch army announced today that it had occupied the city of Baralaiga in western Java, about 30 miles southwest of Batavia.

[Associated Press, Batavia, 22nd] A Dutch communique hinted that the Dutch army had approached the bases of Giri and Mulifan in central Java. Once these two places fall, any symbol of central control by the Republic of Indonesia will likely end.

### Corpses of Tojo and Seven Other War Criminals Cremated, Ashes Scattered in the Wind Yesterday, Representatives of Four Allied Supervisory Nations Attend Execution

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd, United Press] Hideki Tojo was hanged this morning, and his cremated ashes were scattered in the wind, as were those of the other six criminals. The hanging began at 00:01 midnight and ended in 33 minutes. The corpses were all transported in US military trucks, escorted by US military police in jeeps to Yokohama. Before 7:45 AM, each corpse was placed in accordance with American rituals, and at 7:45 AM they were sent to the Yokohama Municipal Crematorium. The cremation began at 8:10 AM and was completed at 9:30 AM. The ashes were divided into seven small black boxes, and were carried out of the crematorium by seven jeeps for scattering.

A Glimpse of the Execution

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 23rd] Tojo and seven other war criminals were hanged in great secrecy before dawn today. The American representative of the Allied Council for Japan Control, Mr. Shepherd, General Shang Zhen, the Chinese representative, Mr. Badrick, the British representative, and Mr. Trevianko, the Soviet representative, all personally attended the execution. Journalists were not allowed to enter. The criminals were executed in two batches. The first batch consisted of former Prime Minister Tojo, instigator of the invasion of China, Doihara, former commander of the Japanese army in Central China, Matsui, and former commander of the Japanese army in the Philippines, Mutō. They were led into the execution ground by duty officers from Sugamo Prison, followed by a pastor and a monk, each with two American soldiers watching on the left and right, and two officers bringing up the rear. After the four criminals entered the execution ground in single file, the executing officer verified their identities, and then they stepped onto the thirteen-step gallows. After the four criminals were on the gallows, they turned to face the monitoring officers sent by MacArthur. Journalists were not allowed to attend. Black hoods were placed over the heads of the four criminals, and ropes were put around their necks. At that time, the criminals remained silent. Then the executing commander issued an order. The four gallows were raised simultaneously. Doihara died at 7 minutes and 30 seconds after midnight, Tojo died at 10 minutes and 30 seconds after midnight, and Mutō and Matsui died at 11 minutes and 30 seconds and 13 minutes after midnight, respectively. The second batch of three hanged criminals entered the execution ground six minutes after Matsui's death. The three criminals, former Army Chief Itagaki, former Prime Minister Hirota, and former commander of the Kwantung Army, Kimura, were hanged at 20 minutes after midnight. All seven criminals were wearing US military green prison uniforms.

Shouting "Banzai" Three Times Before Death

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Reverend Geizan Chitoshi, who performed the religious ceremony for Tojo and others, said that the seven men shouted "Long live the Emperor and Great Japan" three times each, led by Matsui Ishigen and Itagaki respectively, as they walked towards the gallows. Before their execution, Doihara, Matsui, and Itagaki said they hoped that their deaths would improve relations between China and Japan. Before his death, Doihara recited a short poem, "Dear Chinese People", expressing regret for his past actions.

[United Press, Tokyo] Tojo left behind two letters, one to his family and one to the world, roughly stating his reasons for the war of aggression. Tojo also bequeathed his tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses, false teeth, and Buddhist beads to his wife. Before his execution, he requested a final Japanese meal, and his request was granted. The other six ate US military rations.

National Day of Prayer

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 23rd] According to palace officials, Emperor Hirohito spent the entire day alone in his brown study in the palace today. After the news of Tojo's execution was conveyed, he seemed extremely moved and cancelled the two-week anniversary of the appointment of his son Akihito as crown prince, which was scheduled to be held today. According to the evening newspaper Tokyo Shimbun, Hirohito joined the people of the nation today in a prayer for the maintenance of peace.

### Aggressors Shall Not Be Spared, Symbolizing Victory of Justice

Mei Ru'ao Expresses Views

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] International Court of Justice Chinese Judge Mei Ru'ao said that the execution of Tojo and seven other war criminals symbolized the victory of international justice, showing the world the futility of aggression. This matter has no meaning of revenge, but shows that aggression leads to the gallows rather than a path of glory. The execution of the criminals is a comfort to the people of China and other countries who have suffered from Japanese aggression. Shang Zhen, who watched the execution last night, felt very tired and refused to see guests this morning.

### US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Smith, Will Retire

### Renewed Fighting in Negev, Hopes for Egyptian-Jewish Peace Talks Dashed

[Associated Press, Tel Aviv, 23rd] Jewish and Egyptian forces clashed again today on the Negev front in southern Palestine, with air and land forces mobilized. Hopes for immediate ceasefire talks between the two sides were thus dashed.

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 23rd] An Israeli external affairs consultant sent a letter to Brigadier General Reilly, head of the United Nations Truce Group here, on the 23rd, warning the United Nations that since Egypt refused to accept the UN's call for an Arab-Jewish truce, Israel reserved the right to take any action at any time.

### Japan Plays Democracy Sincerely, House of Representatives Passes Vote of No Confidence, Parliament Dissolved, General Election on January 23rd

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] The Japanese government's supplementary budget for this year was passed by both houses last night at 11:00 PM after the opposition parties in the House of Representatives jointly proposed amendments. In this afternoon's plenary session of the House of Representatives, Social Democratic Party Chairman Katayama took the lead, personally delivering a speech explaining the reasons for the motion of no confidence in the Yoshida Cabinet. Subsequently, members of the Liberal Party expressed their opposition, and the opposition parties refuted them again. As a result, it was passed by a majority. This democratic play, rehearsed for many days, was performed quite sincerely. The Yoshida Cabinet immediately dissolved the House of Representatives in accordance with the Constitution. It is heard that the date of the general election should be within 40 days in accordance with the Constitution, so the government has scheduled it for January 23 next year. After this, there will be no distinction between government parties and opposition parties in Japan, and a fierce and ruthless election campaign will be launched to seize power in the next government.

### Chaotic Order of Deposit and Exchange, Ordered to Suspend Temporarily, Awaiting Central Government Improvement Measures, Those Who Received Application Forms to Be Cashed Starting Today

[This newspaper's report] Mr. Liu, Vice President of the National Bank, announced at 5:00 PM yesterday: He received instructions from the Executive Yuan this afternoon that the method of depositing and exchanging gold and silver needs to be improved. In order to maintain local order and protect the safety of the people, the current deposit and exchange method will be temporarily suspended. After receiving this nationwide suspension of exchange instructions, the National Bank authorities carefully considered the actual situation in the city between suspending the exchange and transporting the exchange. As the gold exchange crowds stood all night, if the suspension of exchange was announced immediately, it would inevitably cause order problems. Therefore, it was decided to temporarily issue application forms for one loan or more to expedite the exchange until the issuance stopped at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. Yesterday, the various contracting banks and firms in the city originally planned to issue a total of 10,000 application forms, but more than 27,000 application forms were issued. The National Bank alone issued 9,000. Although the Executive Yuan has issued a suspension of exchange order, the application forms issued in the city yesterday will still be cashed. The 9,000 application forms issued by the National Bank will be processed in ten days. The last digit of the application form number will be exchanged each day, in the following order: December 24 will exchange "0", December 25 will exchange "9", December 27 will exchange "8", December 28 will exchange "7", December 29 will exchange "6", December 30 will exchange "5", December 31 will exchange "4", January 5 next year will exchange "3", 6 will exchange "2", and 7 will exchange "1". The application forms issued by the other five places, namely China Communications, Farmers Bank, Postal Remittance Bureau, and Cooperative Bank, will be processed in five days. Two numbers will be exchanged each day, in the following order: December 24 will exchange "09", December 25 will exchange "87", December 27 will exchange "65", December 28 will exchange "43", and December 29 will exchange "21".

In response to reporters' inquiries, Mr. Liu said: Regarding the deaths and injuries caused by the run on the bank, and other aftermath matters related to the deposit and exchange, it is thought that the government will have appropriate measures. He also said that today he visited the front of the various exchange banks and bureaus several times and witnessed the chaotic situation. Under this situation, bloody tragedies could have occurred. If criminals took advantage of the chaos, the situation would be even more unimaginable. He privately thought it was lucky that they were able to get through this. The Executive Yuan already had a plan to improve the deposit and exchange methods. Today, after learning about the chaotic situation in Shanghai's gold exchange, it decided to temporarily suspend the exchange. However, the amount of gold and silver exchanged so far only accounts for a very small portion of the government's holdings, so the deposit and exchange business will continue.

[This newspaper's report] The person in charge of the police station gave the following statement last night on the police station's efforts to maintain order during the people's run on gold: (1) Because the locations of the various exchange banks were concentrated in one place, the people rushing to exchange began gathering in groups along the Bund before 9:00 PM the night before. The number of people gathered increased, and the bureau dispatched security police, mounted patrol teams, and mobile team police to disperse them. It was not until about 1:00 AM yesterday morning that order was restored. (2) After 5:00 AM yesterday morning, the people rushed to the front of the various banks again, with the number of people reaching more than 100,000. At this time, the bureau dispatched more than 1,600 police officers. As a result of the strenuous efforts to maintain order, some people rushing to exchange had the unfortunate experience of being squeezed and suffocated. In addition to the police officers on the spot rescuing them and rushing them to the hospital for treatment, dozens of people were revived after receiving artificial respiration. (3) Among the people injured yesterday, in addition to seven people who died due to excessive sweating and physical exhaustion, only Bao Caide, Wen Laifa, and Xu Yuanqing were hospitalized for treatment, and the rest have returned home.

### Gold Bars Have Different Fineness, Mint Issues Statement, Cast As Received, No Additional Allocation

Regarding the fineness of the gold bars produced by the Central Mint, the factory issued the following statement yesterday: "The gold bars produced by our factory are directly manufactured from gold bricks or miscellaneous gold delivered by the Central Bank, and no additional fineness is allocated. If the fineness of the gold bars received is high, the fineness of the gold bars produced will also be high. If the fineness of the gold bars received is low, the fineness of the gold bars produced will also be low. The difference in the color of the gold bars is actually caused by the different fineness of various miscellaneous gold. When it was first produced in mid-November, the Central Bank delivered gold bricks, the fineness of which was between 995.0 and 997.6. Our factory produced them batch by batch with the original fineness. Starting from November 29, the Central Bank delivered miscellaneous gold. As of now, after melting, the fineness of the samples extracted for chemical testing is 966.0 at the lowest. Our factory produces according to the original fineness, and the gold bars produced are marked with the fineness of the chemical testing. The Central Bank exchanges them according to the weight of pure gold contained, and the exchangers have no loss."

### Gold Rush Reaches Frenzy: Stampede Kills Seven, Injures Fifty

Seething Crowds on the Bund; Traffic Severed in the Central District; Unprecedented Chaos

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday's crowds applying to exchange and deposit gold and silver in this city were unprecedented in history. From 9:00 PM the night before to noon yesterday, over 50,000 citizens gathered in one corner of the Bund to exchange currency. Despite the security authorities' best efforts to maintain order, many were killed and injured in the chaos. The severity of the situation forced the authorities to telegraph the Ministry of Finance for assistance. By 4:00 PM, when the order to suspend exchanges was issued, the application process was able to proceed in an orderly manner. It was fortunate that no more significant incidents occurred.

From 9:00 PM the night before, crowds had already gathered in front of various banks on the Bund. Despite repeated dispersal by the police and mounted patrol, the lure of profit led the masses to continue gathering in the rain until midnight. Around 2:00 AM, security personnel exerted all efforts to drive the main force of the exchange crowd north of the Suzhou Creek, closely guarding the bridgeheads. However, small scattered groups still managed to hide in major buildings and small boats on the Huangpu River. Once the curfew passed, lines in front of the handling banks were so dense that they were impassable, and the noise was deafening, obstructing all nearby traffic. From 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM, Sichuan Road, from Nanjing Road to Fuzhou Road, was completely cut off by the exchange crowd. Additionally, the area from the Bund to the vicinity of Shandong Road and Sichuan Road was filled with a sea of people, blocking traffic. All types of vehicles were temporarily ordered to detour.

A Squad of Eight Blind Men Joins the Rush

Among the exchange crowd, many had traveled from distant suburbs, waiting all night, eager to see the true face of the central bank's allocated gold. Even eight blind citizens from Hart Road in the city formed a squad and rushed to exchange currency. The gold fever in Shanghai had reached its peak. In this surging tide of people, women, children, and those with weaker physical constitutions were unable to withstand the pressure, falling to the ground and being trampled to death. Seven people were killed, and over fifty injured were sent to the hospital for treatment, with names recorded for them. Countless others sustained minor injuries and left on their own. The police bureau's motorized vehicle brigade, mounted patrol brigade, security police corps, and joint patrol teams were all mobilized throughout the day. Bureau Chief Shu Ping also personally arrived at the scene, directing and maintaining order with all his might. By noon, the order of the application queue began to improve gradually. Onlookers were dispersed, and those queuing were able to receive application forms in order. At the same time, to adapt to the situation, the bank temporarily decided to issue an additional 17,000 application forms.

Crowd Lingers Until Evening: Ground Covered in Torn Clothing and Shoes

Until about 5:00 PM, the crowds in front of several handling banks remained congested. At several bustling exchange centers, broken raincoats, rain boots, discarded umbrellas, and other items littered the ground, cleared away by sanitation workers in truckloads. According to the reporter's observations, only a few were fortunate enough to obtain gold at the official price. The rest of the exchangers gained nothing from their efforts. Apart from the mental and physical suffering, the value of lost personal belongings often exceeded the value of an ounce of gold in the market.

Furthermore, as of last night, fifty slightly injured and two seriously injured exchange citizens have been identified and sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, with further investigations pending. The names and addresses of the seven who died from being trampled are as follows: Xu Guiyu (29 years old, from Zaoning, residing at 401 Lanzhou Road), Ruan Hongzhou (29 years old, from Shaoxing, residing at 2 Shenglifeng Lane, Baiyi Street, Nanshi), Zhou Zhigao (30 years old, from Haimen, residing at 4, Lane 284, Ningbo Road), Sun Fucai (35 years old, from Zhenjiang, residing at 7, Lane 44, Huacaogjie, Fangbang Middle Road), Wang Shifang (30 years old, from Fenghua, residing at 32, Lane 237, Xuzhen Road), Cheng Wenzhao (30 years old, from Ningbo, residing at B5, Lane 409, Zhongzheng South 2nd Road), Bian Wenying (30 years old, from Gaoyou, residing at 2, Lane 59, Guanyinge).

### Low-Interest Loans for Teachers and Staff of Private Schools: Many Applicants, Insufficient Allocation

[Report from this newspaper] Due to the difficult living conditions of teachers and staff in private primary and secondary schools in this city that have not collected secondary tuition fees, they previously submitted a request to the city's Education Bureau to negotiate low-interest loans with banks. The Education Bureau separately negotiated with nine banks, including the City Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, New China Bank, Shanghai Bank, Zhejiang First Bank, China Industrial Bank, Union Bank, Zhongnan Bank, and Mainland Bank. Each school's teacher or staff member can borrow 400 yuan, with interest halved from the market rate, for a term of two months. The school principal is responsible for repaying all principal and interest on time. The Education Bureau instructed each school to submit a list of teachers and staff members who need to borrow the money, in duplicate, along with a genuine security deposit, to the bureau for review. The application period ended at 5:00 PM on the 22nd, with a total of 235 schools and 2,266 teachers and staff members applying. However, because the total amount of loans is 700,000 yuan, and based on an allocation of 400 yuan per person, only 1,750 people can be loaned money. Therefore, the Education Bureau intends to remove 516 people from the list of applicants. The Education Bureau will notify the qualified applicants and then the banks, who will then notify each school to go through the loan procedures.

### Banks and Money Shops Increase Capital, Pay Cash for Shares: City Chamber of Commerce Cables Again for Release

The Ministry of Finance's Approved Measures Still Present Obstacles in Practice; Excessive Financial Restrictions Detract from the Meaning of Capital Increase

The City Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the cash share payments for bank and money shop capital increases be returned after the capital verification was completed. The Ministry of Finance replied yesterday, stating that it has been approved by the Ministry that the cash for bank and money shop capital increases should still be deposited in the Central Bank for three months according to regulations. However, to adapt to actual needs, in addition to applying to use the deposited funds according to Article 3 of the measures for commercial banks to use the deposited capital after adjusting their capital, any mortgage loans that comply with the Banking Law and have a term of more than one month may apply to the Central Bank to use the funds. Loans for agricultural, industrial, mining production, and public transportation projects may also be approved by the Ministry on a case-by-case basis. The Chamber of Commerce believes that the above-mentioned alternative measures still present obstacles in practice and has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance again, requesting that the cash for bank and money shop capital increases be exempted from freezing.

The original telegram stated: The restrictions in Article 5 of the measures for commercial banks to adjust their capital originally included banks, money shops, and trust companies nationwide, with a very wide scope. Although your Ministry has allowed mortgage loans with a term of one month or more to use the increased capital, which is a relaxation of the original measures for commercial banks to deposit and use capital, it still presents obstacles in practice. This is because: (1) In recent years, bank and money shop loans have often been for five to seven days, or even one to two days, with no loans having a term of more than one month. Although it is called a relaxation, it does not actually help. (2) Money shops have always focused on credit loans. The Banking Law has a special chapter for money shops, setting the limit for credit loans at 50% of the total capital. For loans to wholesalers and retailers, the goods are mainly quickly circulated, and the goods stored in the store cannot actually be used as collateral. This is the key to why money shops are popular with small and medium-sized businesses. With the Lunar New Year approaching, if the increased capital must be used for mortgage loans with a term of more than one month to be used, commercial turnover will be even more difficult. (3) Financial control should have a certain limit. If bank and money shop loans exceed the scope prescribed by the Banking Law, there are special regulations for punishment according to law. If there are multiple layers of control, and they cannot be used unless they are transferred to the National Bank and approved in advance, then the state will lose its effectiveness in facilitating funds and assisting industry and commerce for the financial industry and will detract from the meaning of capital increase. This is probably unprecedented in China and abroad. Your Excellency should report to the Executive Yuan and eliminate these unreasonable articles, so that the industry can fulfill its responsibility of adjusting market conditions. In addition to this case being continued by the three guilds of banks, money shops, and trusts in a telegram, I respectfully extend the unfulfilled intentions of the guilds as above, hoping that they will be adopted and implemented, which is truly convenient for the public.

### North China Hot Money Gathers in Shanghai: Market Money Supply is Loose and Excessive

Recently, hot money from various parts of North China has flocked to Shanghai, and the way this money arrives is mostly in cash. This is the biggest reason for the recent abundant funds and loose money supply in Shanghai. According to authoritative sources, the large influx of northern capital into Shanghai is noteworthy.

Yesterday's market money supply continued to show signs of looseness and excess. Both those within and outside the industry were universally bullish. Although the demand for funds was slightly stronger, it did not affect the trend. The market interbank lending rate remained between 12 yuan and 15 yuan. It is said that from now until the end of the Gregorian calendar year, there are many seekers for funds, and the interbank lending rate has been shouted up to 20 yuan.
