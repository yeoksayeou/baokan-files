### US Senate Passes Aid to China Bill; House Restores Almost All Cuts; Compromise Bill Being Drafted with House

[Central News Agency, Washington, 10th Day] The $460 million aid to China plan was passed by the Senate on the morning of the 16th with a vote of 60 to 9 after two and a half hours of discussion. Following the Senate's passage of the bill, representatives were immediately appointed to draft a compromise bill with House representatives. The Senate-passed aid to China plan restored $60 million of the $63 million cut by the House. It stipulates that $335 million of the $460 million will be used as economic assistance under the management of the Economic Cooperation Administration, while the remaining $125 million will be granted to China for free disposal, to be used for military or other purposes. The Senate has restored the aid plan's duration to twelve months and removed the House's stipulation that the entire aid to China plan be supervised in accordance with the aid methods for Greece and Turkey. In its report, the Senate Appropriations Committee strongly urged careful handling of economic aid to China funds to avoid confusion with the $125 million grant for military purposes. The committee believes that adopting a policy of inaction would have extremely unfortunate consequences. The committee stated: "We were deeply impressed by the confidential opinions of Secretary of the Army Royall and General Wedemeyer." The committee also stated: "(During discussions on China, we learned that the situation in China is still hopeful)." At the same time, it warned Congress that American officials sent to China to implement the plan should be absolutely loyal to the United States and absolutely anti-communist. Although the committee urged that the $125 million grant for free disposal be used for military purposes, it did not change the original legislative intent.

[Associated Press, Washington, 15th Day] The House Appropriations Committee on the 15th rejected the State Department's request for $5 million. Most of this amount was to be used for agricultural, scientific, and student exchange programs between the department and China.

Regarding the issue of Japan, we should insist on obtaining compensation, and the control after the peace treaty is signed is particularly important to our country, and we will not retreat from our position. In addition, Wang also elaborated on US aid and United Nations issues.

### Wang Yunwu Reports on Second Half of Year Finances

Measures to Rectify Tax Collection Being Drafted

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Day] The Finance and Banking Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a closed-door meeting on the afternoon of the 16th to hear the government's financial report. The meeting was chaired by Liu Zhendong, convener of the committee, with more than 100 legislators including Deng Feihuang, Jiang Yiping, and Cui Jingbo in attendance. Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu and Vice Minister of Finance Xu Bi were invited to attend. Wang Yunwu reported on the current financial situation for one hour. Wang's report was frank and pragmatic, providing a detailed analysis of the current financial situation. The report can be divided into two parts: one is the current state of national revenue, and the other is the plan to balance revenue and expenditure. Wang first stated that the tax revenue for the first half of the year was 45 trillion to 50 trillion yuan, and the budget for tax revenue in the second half of the year is approximately 300 trillion yuan. The total budgeted financial revenue is expected to reach more than 540 trillion yuan (please refer to the first page of this newspaper on the 16th). As for the expenditure budget, it is currently being compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics. The ordinary revenue and expenditure of the second half of the year are expected to be balanced, while special expenditures will require other solutions. The expenditures in the second half of the year, in addition to ordinary administrative expenses, are mainly for the salaries of civil servants, soldiers, military officers, and for the suppression of the rebellion. Efforts will be made to gradually bring revenue and expenditure closer to balance. The current plan is to increase revenue in the following four ways: (1) Expanding tax sources and rectifying tax collection; (2) Utilizing US aid; (3) Selling relief materials; (4) Selling enemy and puppet materials. Measures for expanding tax sources and rectifying tax collection are currently being drafted and will soon be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process and be implemented. Regarding the issue of levying property tax, the Ministry of Finance is extremely supportive in principle, but the technical aspects still need to be studied. As for the use of overseas deposits of Chinese citizens, our country has negotiated with deposit countries several times in the past, but foreign countries are unwilling to provide the list of depositors based on their banking laws, so there is currently no good way to use them. In his report, Wang also mentioned the current foreign exchange policy, saying that Yu Hongjun has made considerable improvements, and the Ministry of Finance will cooperate closely with the Central Bank in the future. After Wang's report, more than ten people including Wu Wangji made suggestions and inquiries, and Wang gave them all replies. The meeting adjourned at 7 p.m.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Day] The Ministry of Finance has drafted a plan to rectify tax collection and expand tax sources, which will soon be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process and be implemented within days. The plan stipulates improvement measures for customs, salt, commodities, and direct taxes. The details are as follows: (1) Customs duties will be revised, tax rates will be increased, except for those restricted by reciprocal treaties that cannot be revised, the rest will be appropriately increased. (2) Salt tax rates will be slightly increased, provided that it does not hinder the burden on the common people. (3) For commodity tax, the basis for taxation in the past was the price of goods two months ago. In the future, it will be changed to the price of goods one month ago as the basis for collection. (4) Efforts will be made to eliminate embezzlement in direct taxes.

Significant progress in suppressing the rebellion militarily will be made within the next six months. Currently, forces are being concentrated to adopt an active and proactive strategy, first seeking to clear the central China battlefield of bandits south of the Yellow River, then clearing Hebei, and then recovering the lost territories in the Northeast. Mobile tactics will be used to first seek the connection of point to point for important strongholds. He and Gu both particularly emphasized the importance of raising morale, improving the treatment of soldiers, and establishing local forces, and implementing total war is also an urgent task for the future. Gu admitted in his report that the bandit army has increased compared to when Japan surrendered. The bandits currently have more than one million regular troops and more than 900,000 militia.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Day] The Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang held a regular meeting on the morning of the 16th, chaired by President Chiang.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Day] The presidents of the Judicial and Examination Yuan have been approved by the Central Standing Committee of the Kuomintang to be Wang Chonghui and Zhang Boling respectively.

### Youth Party Sends Letter to Weng Wenhao; Declares Non-Participation in Executive Yuan; Separate Letter Explains Details to Chen and Lei

[Our City News] The Youth Party, due to the prolonged unresolved issue of legislators, has decided not to participate in the Executive Yuan in order to carry out its previous statement. It also does not intend to nominate candidates for participation in the Judicial and Examination Yuan. After making this decision at a meeting of its Central Standing Committee on the morning of the 16th, the party immediately telegraphed Premier Weng, requesting him to promptly seek other candidates for the two ministerial posts and the two political committee member posts to avoid a vacancy in government affairs. At the same time, it sent letters to Chen Bulei and Lei Zhen, explaining the details.

### Conversation with a Certain KMT Figure

President Hopes Youth Party Will Participate in Government

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 16th Day] Regarding the letter sent by Chen Qitian, Zuo Shunsheng, and two others from the Youth Party to Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan, stating that they cannot participate in the government, a reporter interviewed a certain figure in the Chinese Kuomintang familiar with the issue of the Youth Party's participation in the government to inquire about his opinion. He replied: "As far as I know, the letter sent by Chen, Zuo, and the other two to Premier Weng has not yet arrived in Nanjing. We have only seen the press release disclosing the letter. The responsible figures of the Youth Party are still using the unresolved issue of the number of legislators as a reason for expressing their non-participation in the government. We really cannot understand this. It is even more regrettable if this affects the cooperation between the Youth Party and our party since the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War. (1) Legally speaking, legislators should be elected based on the number of votes received, but the responsible figures of our party's Central Committee have repeatedly expressed regret that the Youth Party's elected legislators have not reached the expected number, and are currently doing their best to remedy the situation while taking into account the facts. The importance our party attaches to the Youth Party's cooperation can be seen from this. (2) In terms of party politics, the status of a minority party in the Legislative Yuan is not determined by the number of members. However, our party's Central Committee is striving to increase the number of friendly party members. This work takes time, but unexpectedly, members of friendly parties do not understand this. (3) We believe that the participation of Youth Party members in the Executive Yuan to jointly plan the country's major affairs can enhance the cooperation between the two parties and help resolve the issue of legislators. Now, the Youth Party insists on the issue of the number of legislators as a prerequisite for their participation in the Executive Yuan, which confuses two different issues and only increases the difficulty of resolving the problem." Finally, the figure also told the reporter: "President Chiang is planning to invite Youth Party members to serve as Vice President of the Examination Yuan and has asked the party to recommend Grand Justices and Examination Committee members. I firmly believe that President Chiang and our party's Central Committee will not easily give up hope for the Youth Party. I sincerely hope that the Youth Party will resolutely break the deadlock and participate in the government, based on a spirit of mutual understanding and mutual trust, and treat our party with sincerity so that the original intention of cooperating to save the country in the past can be carried out. At this constitutional period, no matter what, the interests of the country should be placed above the interests of the party."

### First Sound of Exercising Powers; Price Hikes Should Not Be Ignored; Control Yuan Proposes Corrective Action; Asks Government to Take Emergency Measures Swiftly

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Day] The first Control Yuan supervisors under the constitution exercised their powers for the first time on the 16th, using corrective powers to propose corrective action to the Executive Yuan authorities. The cause of the case states: "The recent surge in prices, with no effective measures taken by the government, should be corrected." This was a temporary motion proposed by supervisors Quan Shaowen, Chen Lianyuan, Guo Changhe, Chai Feng, and 31 others at the third meeting held on the morning of the 16th. After the president of the Yuan brought it up at the meeting, it immediately gained the consent of all supervisors. It was decided to propose it in the name of the general assembly and sent to the Executive Yuan in the afternoon of the 16th. The case was proposed at the time of adjournment, which was past 12 o'clock. After the secretariat read the full text, some supervisors believed that the wording should be studied and advocated for the establishment of a review committee to review it before submitting it for approval at the general assembly on the 17th. Others suggested that it was already time for adjournment and that opinions on extending the time should be sought before discussion. At this time, a supervisor stated in a very solemn tone: "Everyone must know that some people are eager to adjourn because it is time for dinner, but you must know that we are representing millions of people to exercise our powers. We cannot delay the lack of food for the majority for the sake of the individual's dinner!" Others advocated that the matter was extremely important and that the time should be extended indefinitely. Then, someone proposed that a discussion should be held on whether it should be proposed in the name of the general assembly or in the name of the proposers. However, after some people spoke, it was unanimously agreed that it should be proposed in the name of the general assembly, and that the corrective action had already been endorsed by more than 30 people, so there was no need to submit it for review again, and it was unanimously passed. The specific reasons for the case are recorded as follows: "Recently, prices have been rising like wildfire, affecting the entire country with panic. At this time of mobilization to suppress the rebellion, it is crucial to stabilize the people's livelihood. However, the administrative authorities have so far ignored this and have not taken appropriate countermeasures. Some measures even contribute to the rise in prices, such as: (1) the unrestrained lending of national banks and the increase in lending interest rates; (2) the leadership of state-owned enterprises in raising prices; (3) regarding the issue of currency reform, the relevant authorities have repeatedly made irresponsible remarks, affecting the people's confidence in the legal tender, leading to the daily depreciation of the currency and the increase in prices. If this situation is allowed to continue, it will inevitably shake the foundation of the country. We believe that it is necessary to request the government to take emergency measures swiftly, and we hereby propose corrective action according to law. Respectfully request a public decision."

Drafting of Control Law Completed; To Be Proposed for Discussion at Fourth Yuan Meeting Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th Day] The Control Yuan held its third meeting at 9:30 a.m. on the 16th, chaired by Yu Youren. The cases discussed today were: (1) the draft Control Law, (2) the draft Organization Law of Various Committees. The first case has been largely discussed. A drafting committee will be re-established to meet in the afternoon of the 16th to study it in detail and propose it for discussion article by article at the fourth meeting to be held on the morning of the 17th. The second case was given a general discussion, but as it was time for adjournment, the drafting and review work will be carried out after the drafting of the Control Law is completed.

The content of the Control Law includes the procedures for exercising the powers of consent, impeachment, censure, and corrective action. The entire case is divided into six chapters, including Chapter 1 General Provisions, Chapter 2 Power of Consent, Chapter 3 Power of Impeachment, Chapter 4 Power of Censure, Chapter 5 Power of Corrective Action, and Chapter 6 Supplementary Provisions, totaling 32 articles. After the chairman announced the start of the discussion, the supervisors spoke one after another, mostly focusing on strengthening their own powers. During the discussion of the case on the Organization Law of Various Committees, most expressed that too many people were being used in the various committees, which was close to wasteful, and that it was not necessary to make rigid regulations. As for the establishment of the various committees, they should be established according to the nature of the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan. Zhang Dinghua stated that another committee should be established to target the Judicial and Examination Yuan, otherwise, there would be no way to investigate if the two Yuans violated the law or neglected their duties. Wang Guanwu advocated adding a Food Committee, while the Military Committee should be changed to a National Defense Committee, as national defense can include military affairs. The general discussion was thus completed.

The drafting committee of the Control Law of the Control Yuan held a meeting at 3:30 p.m. on the 10th, with 39 supervisors in attendance, chaired by Lü Chao. The draft proposed by the 　 committee was discussed article by article. Because changes in some words and phrases would affect the powers of the Control Yuan, the discussion was extremely cautious. The following are the points that were discussed for a long time and had many differences: (1) In Article 2, when the Control Yuan exercises its supervisory powers, the original draft stipulated that the Control Yuan would send personnel to investigate. The investigation power has now been amended to be enhanced, and supervisors can go to various agencies and public organizations to conduct investigation work by holding an inspection certificate or by special investigation certificates issued by the Control Yuan Supervisors' Office. (2) In the Power of Consent section of Chapter 2, some advocated deleting the entire section and drafting a separate method, but some argued that the power of consent is a type of supervisory power and should not be listed separately. It was then decided not to list it separately, but to make amendments to the articles. The original Article 8 was deleted, and Article 9 was changed to "When the President nominates the President and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, the President and Vice President of the Examination Yuan, and the Grand Justices of the Judicial Yuan and the Examination Committee members of the Examination Yuan, they shall attach their qualifications and opinions for review. If the Control Yuan does not agree, it shall request the President to nominate another candidate in writing." (3) In the Power of Impeachment section of Chapter 3, the procedures for conducting impeachment cases are stipulated in great detail. Among them, there are rigid regulations on the filing of impeachment cases. The review committee met until 8:30 p.m. before adjourning. This draft will be proposed for discussion at the fourth meeting on the morning of the 17th.

### Over 5,000 Bandits Killed in the Victory at Longshan; Cao Zhenduo's Division and Qian Baiying's Brigade are Credited with the Greatest Merit

[Dispatch from Jinan, 16th] According to statistics, in the victory at Longshan, the National Army killed or wounded over 5,000 bandits (including over 2,000 in the battles of Yujiazhuang and Zhangqiu), captured 696 rifles, 4 heavy machine guns, 28 light machine guns, 4 mortars, and 17 grenade launchers, and captured over 300 prisoners.

Over a hundred soldiers from Qian's brigade headquarters were also killed. However, Qian, believing in our invincibility and seeking only victory regardless of sacrifice, finally defeated the stubborn bandits, creating a glorious victory. A reporter took a special car to the battlefield on the 16th and still saw bullet holes everywhere and bandit corpses everywhere, showing the intensity of the battle. To reward the meritorious, Wang Yaowu not only gave the brigade a reward of 500 million yuan and recorded a major merit, but also reported to the Ministry of National Defense for awards to meritorious generals below Brigade Commander Qian.

Editorial

### Adjustment of the International Military System

Since the establishment of the Two-Constitution government organization, there have been new changes in the opening of national defense military administration, both in personnel and in systems. In terms of personnel, General He Yingqin has been appointed as the Minister of National Defense, and General Gu Zhutong has succeeded him as the Chief of the General Staff. The personnel of the suppression headquarters in other regions have also been newly adjusted in accordance with the new situation. In terms of systems, the national defense military system has been re-established, and the National Defense Department's Organic Law has been revised. According to Premier Weng of the Executive Yuan's reply to the Legislative Yuan's questions on the 15th regarding the reform of military administration, he stated: The basic principles of the National Defense Department's revised Organic Law have been approved by the President, which stipulate that "the Minister of National Defense is responsible for military policy and administration, and the Chief of the General Staff is the Chief of Staff of the Commander-in-Chief and the administrative officer of the Minister of National Defense, responsible for the planning and guidance of military affairs." "The Chief of the General Staff shall act on military orders in accordance with the President's orders, and on military administration matters in accordance with the Minister's orders, or as instructed by the Minister." This is the outline of the new national defense military system. Undoubtedly, it has undergone fundamental changes from the old National Defense Department's organization in terms of nature and command system. It is expected that the revised Organic Law will be more easily passed by the Legislative Yuan. In fact, this new national defense military system is more rational and perfect than the old form.

The Ministry of National Defense is the central nerve of a country's military cells and the hub of the command structure. Military action relies on command, and the flexibility of command relies on wisdom. Wisdom does not originate from one person, but from a multitude of think tanks and experienced people. The final choice of a point to command and utilize rests with one person. The Ministry of National Defense manages military administration and military orders, like a person with two arms, like a bird with two wings. Military administration and military orders must be divided, especially in terms of intellectual division, but their planned actions and issued command orders are ultimately decided by the supreme commander. The central headquarters of various countries during wartime and the government telecommunications system of our country during wartime are all like this. The Ministry of National Defense established in our country the year before last was a scaled-down version of the wartime Military Affairs Commission in terms of administration; in terms of system, it concentrated the power of military administration and military orders in one person. As a result, the Minister of National Defense had no real power, and all military administration and military orders were completely controlled by the Chief of the General Staff. The Chief of Staff had four general headquarters under him: Army, Air Force, Navy, and Joint Logistics. The Chief of Staff reported directly to the Chairman of the National Government. Thus, the so-called Minister of National Defense was equivalent to the Executive Yuan representative of the Chief of Staff. The characteristic of this system was the unified command of the army, navy, and air force, and the unified handling of forward operations and rear services by one person, with the advantage of "focusing on one point," without fear of disconnection or feeling of shortage. However, at the same time, it also had many shortcomings: excessive power, prone to arbitrariness, not accountable to the Executive Yuan, nor to the Legislative Yuan, and no one but the head of state could control it. This system of military power above all else seemed to have never been used by any country in the world. The old Legislative Yuan of our country did not pass the Organic Law of the Ministry of National Defense and repeatedly warned, pointing out the danger of this system. But this system finally underwent two years of trials and is now coming to a historical end.

In this reorganization of the Ministry of National Defense, the personnel appointments were that General He Yingqin would serve as the Minister, and he is an advanced military officer who commanded both the military administration and military order systems during the Anti-Japanese War without any bias. General Gu Zhutong, the Chief of the General Staff, is a sincere and steady strategist. In terms of systems, this adjustment of the national defense military system is to gather the wisdom of the majority in the nerve center, and to use the division of military administration and military orders to assist the President as commander-in-chief in selection and command. Its differences from the old system are threefold: (1) In the new Ministry of National Defense, the power of the Minister of National Defense has been considerably increased, and he directs the Chief of the General Staff in military policy and military administration. The Minister is responsible to the Executive Yuan, and the Chief of Staff is responsible to the Minister; (2) The Minister of National Defense is a member of the political affairs meeting, so the Executive Yuan can control the military administration part through the Minister. As for military orders, which relate to national defense secrets, they are not controlled by the Executive Yuan, but are directly commanded by the President; (3) The position of the Chief of the General Staff is technical and intellectual. In terms of military orders, he is the Commander-in-Chief's advisor, designing and commanding the three armed forces for the President. In terms of military administration, he is the Minister's administrative assistant, planning and executing business for the Minister.

Based on these three points, the power of the Chief of the General Staff has been reduced. The power to handle military administration has been handed over to the Minister of National Defense, and the command of operations belongs to the President. The military administration and military orders executed by the Chief of the General Staff avoid arbitrariness and avoid centralization of power. He is a chief of staff who handles matters according to orders and instructions, rather than a主管 chief officer with the power to exert independent will. From a theoretical and factual point of view, this adjustment of the national defense military system is more rational; especially at the present stage when the suppression of rebellion is extremely tense, this adjustment is more perfect.

The military system emphasizes effectiveness, and command and operations emphasize timing; in short, achieving excellent results and seizing favorable opportunities are deeply related to the three factors of 天時 favorable timing, 地利 geographical advantages, and 人和 human harmony. Speaking of 天時 favorable timing, the current national defense military system is in line with the trend and facts; speaking of 地利 geographical advantages, the adjustment of the military system will inevitably be followed by an adjustment of strategy. Today, the main battlefields are in the Central Plains and North China, and the military headquarters must have a clear plan for the re-deployment of strategy; speaking of 人事 personnel, the harmonious relationship between Generals He and Gu, the command of suppression headquarters in various regions, the use and arrangement of military talents, and the support of local forces, can be expected to have progressive measures. Based on this view, we are optimistic about the future military effectiveness and the timing of operations, and we look forward to the new Ministry of National Defense.

### The Dao is in Excrement; Hu Xianwen Claims: Studying Yang Mei Should First Explore Excrement

[Dispatch from Chongqing, 16th] Dean Hu Xianwen, who presided over Yang Mei's examination, gave insightful views on Yang Mei's problem today. He said: Society only pays attention to Yang Mei's not eating, but ignores Yang Mei's strangely small amount of urine in the past 21 days. Historically, there have been starvation experts, but Yang Mei's having a drop of urine in the last ten days of the examination is rare. An average person urinates at least 500 cc per day, otherwise they will be poisoned, and it is absolutely impossible to forcibly not urinate. Where exactly are her excrement hidden? This is still a great mystery and deserves attention. Therefore, regardless of whether Yang Mei's not eating is real or fake, long-term or short-term, before the truth is clear, the phenomenon of her little urine is enough for scientists to study and explore.

### Developing the Guangdong Sugar Industry; More Hopeful Than Taiwan Sugar

Said Zi'en of the National Resources Commission

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Taipei, 16th] The National Resources Commission previously planned to cooperate with the Guangdong Provincial Government to develop the Guangdong sugar industry by dismantling and relocating Taiwan's abandoned sugar factories to Guangdong. It is now planned to dismantle and relocate two sugar factories: one is the Hualien Factory, and the other is the Taichung Second Factory. The former has a daily sugarcane crushing capacity of 1,000 tons, and the latter has 550 tons. However, both factories were damaged during the war, especially the Taichung Factory, where two-thirds of the damaged and missing parts must be repaired and fitted. This task is quite difficult, and the machines are also too old. According to Xi Zi'en, who was sent by the National Resources Commission to Taiwan to investigate these two factories, "From an economic point of view, the funds required to dismantle these two broken factories and repair and fit the parts would be more than building a new factory, which is not cost-effective." Therefore, whether to dismantle and relocate them in the future will depend on his consultation in Guangdong. Xi Zi'en also said: Sugarcane can be grown in Guangdong Province in 12 months, while it takes 16 months in Taiwan Province. The regional conditions are better than those in Taiwan Province, the cost is lower than in Taiwan Province, and the future is very hopeful.

### Soviet Note to British Government Opposes Establishment of West German Government West German Monetary Reform Reaches Agreement

[Reuters, London, 16th] A spokesman for the Soviet Embassy announced today that the Soviet Union has sent a note to Britain stating that it is difficult to accept the London Six-Power Agreement's resolution to establish a West German government independently, and believes that the agreement violates the Potsdam Agreement. This matter was notified by the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Zarubin, to Strang, the chairman of the London Six-Power Conference, on June 7, as the first formal statement of Soviet opposition to the Six-Power Agreement. However, Moscow Radio and Soviet newspapers had already expressed that the Soviet government could not accept the Six-Power Agreement when the Six-Power Conference was held, so this move was indeed expected.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 16th] Rumors are rife here that the Soviet and American authorities are currently discussing the possibility of jointly implementing monetary reform in the four occupied zones of Germany. American officials have already come here from Frankfurt to discuss the matter.

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 15th] The heads of the British, American, and French military governments and their financial advisors held an important meeting tonight, lasting about three hours, mostly discussing the issue of monetary reform. It is believed here that the three zones of West Germany are prepared to proceed with their economic and financial merger plan. Although the American military governor, Clay, refused to discuss the contents of the talks after today's meeting, he made it clear that there was no need to continue talks with the French military governor, Koenig, on the topic of today's meeting. Clay stated that he did not yet know the outcome of the French National Assembly's debate on the London Conference's recommendations, but said that whatever resolution the French parliament may make, it would not affect the resolutions made by the heads of the three military governments today. When asked whether the date of implementation of monetary reform had been informed to German officials, he replied that it had not. When asked whether he intended to accept the Germans' suggestion of implementing tax reform at the same time as monetary reform, he replied that the Germans' suggestion was quite appropriate, but the timing of implementation would depend on unforeseen factors. Clay also stated that today's meeting of the heads of the three military governments did not involve government issues. A communiqué will soon be issued in Frankfurt. He also said that the American side plans to hold another meeting with the French side in Berlin on Wednesday to discuss another issue.

### French Parliament Representatives Decide on West German Agreement Government Strives with Resignation 美英不接受法所提建議
### US and Britain Do Not Accept France's Proposed Recommendations

[Our Newspaper's Report] London, 16th Broadcast: Paris Report, the French cabinet held a four-hour meeting today and decided not to regard the results of the vote on the Six-Power Agreement in the parliament as a formal vote of confidence or no confidence. However, if the National Assembly expresses no confidence, the cabinet has decided to resign.

[United Press, Paris, 16th] The parliamentary debate, which began last Friday, will resume at 3:30 this afternoon. When the left and right wings heavily criticize the government, Schuman and Bidault will respond one by one. Most opponents of the government demanded that the Six-Power Conference on Germany be reopened. In order to win the approval of Britain and the United States at the last moment, the French Foreign Ministry Secretary-General, Chauvel, spent most of the time in London on the 15th talking with British and American officials. However, according to reliable sources, London and Washington have not accepted France's request.

It is rumored that Schuman is preparing to submit the cabinet's resignation to President Auriol after the parliamentary vote on the evening of the 16th, and has completed the list of the new cabinet for submission together. Among the ministers rumored to be resigning from the cabinet is Bidault, but the government spokesman later firmly denied this.

[Reuters, Paris, 15th] Bidault's speech to the National Assembly today did not open up the stalemate faced by the government in the parliament. Opinions within the Socialist Party regarding the London resolutions are still divided. De Gaulle's fierce criticism obviously has a significant impact on the National Assembly's debate, and the fact that Britain and the United States are sacrificing France to support Germany is of concern to most French people. The Socialist Party still hopes that Bevin will support France's proposal and agree to expand the control over the Ruhr, so that the joint management of the Ruhr's industry by the six countries is not limited to managing the distribution of its industrial products.

### Malayan Uprising Expands British Commissioner Issues Emergency Order

Singapore Military Police on Alert

[Reuters, Singapore, Tenth Day] The uprising of the Malayan Communist Party is expanding. The British High Commissioner to Malaya, Sir Gurney, has issued an order declaring a state of emergency, allowing curfews to be imposed in any location, allowing the arrest of suspected elements, and imposing the death penalty on those who illegally possess weapons. The most recent act of violence occurred last night near Ipoh in Perak State, where three British people were shot and killed by twelve armed bandits, who then looted property and set fire to houses. Rubber plantations owned by Europeans throughout Malaya are all uneasy. Seven large plantations have already suspended operations, and white people are preparing to evacuate. Singapore is currently still considered stable, but the military police are on alert to prevent riots from occurring.

### Danube Conference to be Held Next Month Soviet Union Accepts US Proposal Austria to be Observer

[Reuters, Washington, 15th] The State Department revealed that the Soviet Union has agreed to convene the Danube Conference on July 30. In addition to stating the previous exceptions, the Soviet Embassy in Washington submitted a note to the US government yesterday agreeing to invite Austria to attend the conference as an observer, allowing it to provide opinions without the right to vote. The Soviet note also stated that regarding the location of the meeting being set in Belgrade, it could not be accepted by the Soviet Union because the Yugoslav government was unable to prepare the general preparations for convening the meeting on that day, and suggested that it be held in the capital of another Danube riparian country.

The Soviet note also agreed to the US proposal that the invitations to convene the Danube Conference should be issued by the Four Powers. This Soviet note was a response to the US proposal made on May 26, requesting that the decision to convene the Danube Conference made by the Foreign Ministers Conference last December be implemented. The Foreign Ministers Conference decided that the Danube Conference should be attended by the representatives of the Four Powers of the Foreign Ministers Conference, and the Danube countries of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Austria. Because the Austrian peace treaty has not yet been concluded, Austria's participation has become one of the points of contention between the Soviet Union and the Western powers. The Soviet Union's agreement to discuss one of the "specific issues" mentioned by Marshall with the United States is also the first time that the United States and the Soviet Union have engaged in a diplomatic battle in recent weeks. The US proposal to the Soviet Union to implement the Foreign Ministers Conference resolution to convene the Danube Conference came a few days after the launch of the US-Soviet diplomatic battle. At the time, some people believed that the US move was intended to initiate the resumption of negotiations with the Soviet Union on minor issues first, in order to test whether the Soviet Union had the sincerity to peacefully resolve all issues.

### Preventing the Development of Communism Lies in Economic Aid to Asia

[Central News Agency, London, 15th] The "Manchester Guardian" stated in today's editorial on the expansion of communism in Asia and its relationship with other parts of the world that communism is currently developing in most countries in Asia, especially in places such as Burma, Ceylon, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaya. However, if communism wants to seize the entire of Asia, it must first gain an advantage in China and India. However, the current position of the Chinese Nationalist Party is not as serious as generally believed. Since the Kuomintang is committed to defending Chinese traditions, it has gained considerable support. The report continued that if India or China or both fall under the control of the Communist Party, the political and economic organization of the entire world will be changed. But the Western world must not want the Sovietization of Asia, and the way to prevent this is to emulate the approach of the Marshall Plan for Europe and provide economic assistance to Asia in order to save some of the worst economic situations.

### US and Britain Urge Three Nordic Countries to Form Alliance Against Aggression

[Reuters, London, 15th] Well-informed sources in Sweden said today that the United States and Britain have urged Sweden to participate in the Scandinavian joint defense. Sweden has indicated that any regional joint defense between Norway and Denmark, combined with the joint defense of the five countries of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, is something Sweden is unwilling to participate in in order to avoid angering the Soviet Union, and that Sweden cannot obtain military assistance. Norway and Denmark do not believe that Scandinavia can maintain neutrality once war breaks out between the West and the East, and hope to maintain joint defense with Western Europe.

[Reuters, Stockholm, 15th] The proposal to create a Scandinavian military alliance has recently gained more support. Swedish military experts, after detailed research, believe that this alliance will be a major factor in preventing the Scandinavian region from being invaded. They also believe that military cooperation between Sweden, Norway, and Denmark can obtain the following benefits: Geographically speaking, the Scandinavian military group extends from the Danish-German coast to the Varanger Fjord in the far north of Norway, with a coastline of 2,200 kilometers. Its depth is 400 kilometers from Songzhiwar in the Gulf of Bothnia in Sweden to Trondheim on the Norwegian coast, and 800 kilometers from Stockholm to Bergen. Within this area, there are winding harbors and many mountains and forests, which are very unfavorable to intruders from the outside. In the event of an invasion, it will be impossible to take it down in one fell swoop, and it will take months to achieve any results. During this period, external assistance to Scandinavia will definitely be able to reach Scandinavia. (2) Experts estimate that the total strength of the Scandinavian group's defense force is one million people, including the Danish and Norwegian militia groups that have experience in underground movements during wartime. As for the sophistication of Swedish military weapons, it is second only to the Soviet Union and Britain in Europe. (3) The air forces of the three countries have approximately 1,000 aircraft, and the navies have approximately 150 warships. (4) In terms of industry and supply, the combined strength of the Scandinavian group is also at the forefront in Europe. Sweden's famous steel mills and arsenals, the shipyards of the three countries, Denmark's automatic light weapons, and the heavy water produced by Norway needed for atomic bombs are all powerful war potentials. (5) The length of the coastline and the excellence of the harbors facilitate the import of raw materials and war supplies, making it difficult for the enemy to cut them off. Strategically speaking, the joint defense of the three countries makes it difficult to cut off Sweden's external transportation. As long as one of Norway and Denmark has not been occupied by the enemy, Sweden can keep its transportation line to the west open. Military experts also pointed out that the Gulf of Bothnia in eastern Sweden, although the soft underbelly of Scandinavia, would require the concentration of a large number of ships to attack from Finland, which is more difficult. An attack from the Baltic Sea will first encounter the obstruction of Gotland Island, which can also have a considerable delaying effect. The most dangerous thing is that the industrial area on the east coast of Sweden is vulnerable to air strikes from the east, and a landing attack may be launched from Denmark across the sea towards southern Sweden. In the former case, the air defense on the east coast must be greatly strengthened. In the latter case, the conclusion of a military alliance between the three countries can enable Sweden and Norway to set up bases in Denmark first to resist enemies from the European continent.

### US Senate Passes Foreign Aid Bill Most of Reduction Restored Chairman of House Appropriations Committee Expresses Opposition

[Our Newspaper's Report] New York, 16th Broadcast: Washington Report: Taber, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, told the House today that it is reasonable to reduce the foreign aid fund, and that the fund can be effective if it is used properly. He will strongly oppose the Senate's restoration of the $1.175 billion.

[United Press, Washington, 16th] The Senate passed the $6,125,710,228 foreign aid bill by a vote of 60 to 9 on the morning of the 16th. The bill has been transferred to the House of Representatives so that it can be decided in the meeting before the recess. The Senate passed the amendment of the Senate Appropriations Committee by a vote of 64 to 15, restoring most of the $2,160,000,000 that was cut by the House of Representatives. At the same time, the House of Representatives' passage of extending the use of the fund for fifteen months was also cancelled, and the twelve months recommended by the administrative authorities was restored. The above bill has been transferred to the joint conference committee of the two houses, which is scheduled to begin work this afternoon to correct the differences between the two houses.

[Reuters, Washington, 16th] After a lengthy debate, the Senate voted to increase foreign aid funding and returned the bill to the House of Representatives for discussion, which is expected to be opposed by the House of Representatives. The foreign aid funding approved by the Senate has increased significantly in both the Far East and Europe, partly due to raising the number approved by the House of Representatives to $6,125,710,228, and mostly due to the provision for twelve months of use. According to Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Bridges, the committee voted on the amount of foreign aid funding extremely generously, and this allocation is an adventurous move towards the American faith.

### Gasoline Panic Intensifies Black Market Supply Not Lacking Price Up to One Million Cars Lining Up for Gas Stretch for Miles Two Public Bus Routes Suspended

[Our Newspaper's Report] The severity of the oil shortage problem has intensified in recent days. Although oil prices have just been adjusted and the refueling hours of gas stations near the Bund have been re-regulated, the lines of cars lining up to buy oil have increased rather than decreased. From morning to night, they often stretch for miles, greatly affecting traffic order. According to the persons in charge of various gas stations, their average daily supply of oil is generally below 900 gallons, so the actual number of vehicles that can purchase gasoline at each location will definitely not exceed 100 per day. Calculated based on the city's 52 gas stations, only 5,000 vehicles can get the opportunity to refuel each day, while the total number of motor vehicles in the city is more than ten times this number. Therefore, if the amount of oil supplied is not increased, the congestion and chaos will never be improved.

Among the cars lining up to buy oil, commercial vehicles are the most numerous. Taxis and large trucks often drive to various gas stations at midnight to line up and wait, and the drivers sleep in their cars. Therefore, at the first glimmer of dawn, a long line has already formed in front of the gas stations. Although those who arrive later also join the line, the amount of oil is limited and quickly runs out, not only wasting several hours of time but also leading to a dilemma of being unable to move forward or backward, and being extremely embarrassed. At the same time, the supply of black market gasoline is not lacking, but the price is as high as over one million per gallon. Most car owners who cannot find gasoline can only bear the pain and rely on the black market. In fact, the purpose of restricting fuel consumption by tightening quotas has been completely lost. It is said that the city has a large amount of oil reserves, so where does this large amount of black market gasoline flow in from? Furthermore, why doesn't the authorities order each commercial car company in the city to collect its gasoline purchase certificates and apply directly to the oil company for allocation, in order to reduce the congestion at various gas stations? These two points are likely to become a major question in the minds of most citizens.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The city's public transportation company has recently had difficulties in supplying parts and fuel. With the approval of the municipal government, starting today, the shorter and less important Route 7 and Route 2A will be temporarily suspended. They will be restored once the gasoline supply returns to normal. The company has posted notices at the stations of the above two routes to avoid passengers waiting in vain.

### Avoiding Vehicle Congestion: Dividing Gas Station Locations

Due to vehicles waiting in line at gas stations causing significant traffic obstruction, the authorities, in order to avoid traffic congestion, have divided the gas station locations for small passenger cars and trucks. A trial run will begin on the 18th of this month. The designated locations are as follows: (1) Gas stations for private and commercial passenger cars: (Asia Petroleum) the intersection of Zhongzheng East Road and Sichuan Road, No. 85 Nanjing East Road, and No. 1244 Linsen Middle Road, three locations in total. (Mobil) No. 111 Sichuan Middle Road, the intersection of Zhongzheng East Road and Jinling West Road, and the intersection of Linsen Middle Road and Baoqing Road, three locations in total. (Texaco) One location at Fuzhou Road on Henan Road. (2) Gas stations for trucks: (Asia Petroleum) Datong Road on Beijing West Road, No. 692 Changyang Road, and No. 590 North Sichuan Road, three locations in total. (Mobil) No. 1202 North Sichuan Road, the intersection of West Linsen Road and Huashan Road, and the intersection of Pingliang Road and Yangshupu Road, three locations in total. (Texaco) No. 157 Xizang Road. (3) Other stations can serve both passenger cars and trucks.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Oil Supply Resolved

The problem of fuel oil for ships of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was resolved on the 16th.

The value of each US dollar is National Currency $1,145,000 (official exchange rate $474,000, plus an exchange settlement certificate of $671,000). However, the procedures are quite complicated, so the earliest the oil can be collected is the afternoon of the 17th. The Hai Sui, originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Xiamen at noon on the 15th, the Linsen, originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Guangdong on the morning of the 16th, and the Xilin, originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Tianjin on the morning of the 17th, will all be able to set sail on the 18th.

### Prices Begin to Fall: Three Reasons Analyzed

The prices in Shanghai had been soaring for days, but on the 16th, all prices uniformly began to fall.

(2) There are rumors that US aid will be restored to the original plan, and people's minds are more at ease. (3) The police are closely monitoring the market, which has achieved results.

### Cement Factories in Difficult Situation: Guild Discusses Coping Strategies

[Reported by this newspaper] The National Cement Association believes that the current cement factories are facing difficulties. In terms of production, foreign exchange is not approved by the government for packaging paper bags, making it impossible to place orders. In terms of finance, the necessary funds cannot be raised, and the authorities refuse to provide assistance. In terms of sales, the war is raging, and public and private needs are almost at a standstill, and exports are also difficult to promote on a large scale. Due to these three urgent situations, the cement industry is now in a dilemma of being unable to advance or retreat and unable to survive. It is reported that the association has already reported the above difficulties in detail to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting consultation with relevant parties to quickly find a solution. Recently, it will also hold a board meeting to discuss coping strategies.

### Special Relief Donations: Enthusiastic Pledges

### Implementation Measures for Limited-Price Seats in Movie Theaters Announced

(3) The price of limited-price seats shall be approved and implemented by the Bureau of Social Affairs. (4) If any movie theater reduces the number of limited-price seats or raises prices without authorization, it shall be punished in accordance with the regulations on violating price limits and negotiated prices. (5) Scalpers who rush to buy limited-price tickets shall be severely punished after being caught. If ticket sellers in movie theaters collude with scalpers, they shall be severely punished along with the movie theater after being identified. (6) Limited-price tickets are not allowed to be pre-sold, and patrons must take their seats immediately after purchasing tickets.

### The Public Opinion Survey Committee Will Release 3,000 Dan of Rice Daily Starting Today: Ji Mingzhai States that Off-Site Transactions Have Disappeared

[Reported by this newspaper] The price of rice has been restored to price controls. Mayor Wu rigidly stipulates that the transaction price of rice in the market shall not exceed 9.8 million yuan, and the retail price shall not exceed 10 million yuan. Yesterday, the Public Opinion Survey Committee, together with the Police Bureau, strictly enforced price controls, inspected rice shops, and arrested and sent to the court for handling the responsible persons who marked prices exceeding 10 million yuan.

Yesterday, the Public Opinion Survey Committee continued to release 3,000 dan of rice and decided to release 3,000 dan of supply rice daily from today onwards. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, it will be released in the North Market, and on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, it will be released in the South Market. In addition, with slightly tighter credit and Wuxi also implementing price controls simultaneously, a large number of economic police were dispatched to monitor the market, and rice prices across the board softened. The South Market invited the authorities to set price limits, and all transactions were completed at 9.8 million yuan. In the North Market, only a few low-grade rice transactions were completed, and the rest had no goods to offer. Yesterday, the goods arrived were very scarce, with a total of 2,848 dan arriving in the North and South Markets.

According to Ji Mingzhai, Director of the Grain Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs, off-site transactions have disappeared. The authorities are determined to suppress the soaring rice prices. Anyone who exceeds the price limit set by the authorities and raises prices without authorization in an attempt to obtain illegal profits will be severely punished after being found out.

### Mao Da Rice Shop Guilty of Malpractice: Suspended from Distribution

The People's Food Allocation Committee previously received a confidential report from residents of the 55th, 56th, and 57th neighborhoods of Jinjiaqiao Town, Yangjing District, stating that rice shops in the town were deducting quantities and replacing them with inferior rice. The committee immediately sent personnel to investigate and found that the remaining allocation of rice sold by Mao Da Rice Shop should have been 2 dou and 6 sheng, but in fact, the shop's corridor and bedroom contained as much as 9 shi of American top-grade white rice and 3 shi of American second-grade white rice. The owner of the shop claimed that 9 shi was exchanged by ordinary citizens who disliked the coarse rice and were willing to exchange it with the shop, and the remaining 3 shi were deposited by citizens Ma Liushun and others. When asked about the address of the depositors, the shop owner was speechless. Moreover, the 9 shi of top-grade American rice was of extremely good quality and was not coarse rice, so the claim that citizens disliked the coarse rice and voluntarily exchanged it was even more unreliable. The Public Opinion Survey Committee believes that the shop owner Shi Shenggao, as the Baozhang (neighborhood chief), had such malpractices occur, so in addition to suspending the rice distribution, it also sent a letter to the Bureau of Social Affairs to investigate the matter strictly.

### Knitting Industry Establishes Municipal Trade Union: Workers Object and Demand Re-election

Most of the worker representatives from various factories were not notified to participate in the election in advance. Therefore, they express their disapproval of this municipal trade union and the elected directors and supervisors, which were formed through favoritism and collusion, and request the Municipal Council to uphold justice and hold a general election in accordance with the law.

### Municipal Council Receives Proposal: Suggests Transferring Foreign Deposits to Reform the Currency System to Strengthen Finance

[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Council continued to receive four proposals from various councilors yesterday. The details are as follows: 1. Zhang Zhongyuan, Shao Yongsheng, and others proposed: urgently telegraph the central government to temporarily transfer the funds and deposits of Chinese people fleeing abroad to be used as reserves to immediately reform the currency system, to strengthen finance and reassure the people. The reason for the proposal is: the widespread soaring of prices has broken all previous records and can be called an unprecedented crisis. If measures are not taken to stop it urgently, the national economy will collapse, and the people's hearts in various places will become more and more dissipated. Looking back at the various old and new measures issued by the government to suppress prices, none have been effective. If this continues, the future of the national economy and the people's livelihood will be irreparable. To save the situation, the only way is to reform the currency system as a whole. The method: the government should use its full force to temporarily transfer all private deposits of this country in the United States and funds fleeing abroad to be used as reserves for currency reform and implement it immediately. Zhang and others also requested that the proposal be listed as an urgent proposal and submitted for discussion on the opening day. 2. Pan Jemei and others proposed: to request the Bureau of Public Works to transfer the stones piled up on Tianmu Road to expedite the repair of North Shanxi Road, North Zhejiang Road, and North Xizang Road to facilitate transportation. 3. Pan Jemei and others proposed: to request the local garrison command to strictly prohibit honorary soldiers from demanding money in disguise to maintain military discipline. 4. Zhang Zhongyuan and others proposed: to cancel the restriction on the transfer of cars.

### War Instigator? Chennault Issues Statement Refuting Moscow Radio

General Chennault, General Manager of the Civil Air Transport, held a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters in this city at the Civil Air Transport headquarters at No. 17 The Bund at 10:00 yesterday morning. He issued a written statement in response to the report from the United Press in London on the 13th that he was a "war instigator." The translation is as follows:

"Recently, Moscow Radio and Communist radio commentator Katayev accused Generals Kenney and Lee Liman and myself of being war instigators. Since they are in the habit of publishing false news by distorting facts, I originally did not want to pay attention to the absurd propaganda of the Communists. However, because I am deeply concerned about promoting world peace, I cannot but express my views to the people of anti-Communist countries. I know that my words will never be published in the Communist countries, so it is impossible for me to express my position to the enslaved people of these countries.

When I was invited to attend the House Foreign Affairs Committee to express my views on world peace and aid to China, I used a large map to illustrate that the world has now formed a small world, and that any accident that occurs in one area of this small world will inevitably affect other areas to some extent. I expressed that if the Communist forces continue to expand in China and the Soviet Union fails to abide by the treaty it signed with China in 1945, a third world war will inevitably be triggered. I pointed out with this map that if the Soviet Union's aggression leads to another world war, certain areas may be used as bombing bases.

Although I have served in two world wars, I am not a military man. In the two world wars, I fought to maintain certain principles. These principles are the foundation on which our government was built. I firmly believe that people always have freedom and believe that all people should have security, whether domestically or internationally. To maintain this principle, I am willing to participate in the war again if necessary.

I do not believe that war is a necessary action to solve political and economic problems. War can hardly solve any problems, whether these problems belong to the past or the future. The only necessity of war lies in stopping those who attempt to conquer the world and enslave all mankind. History shows us that there have been many such people in the past. To name a few, William Kaiser, Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo Hideki are all examples. History will eventually show us the complete record of Stalin and his party members. This is the only group in today's world that attempts to conquer other people by force.

War instigators use all the resources of the country to prepare for war. The only war instigators in the world today are a group of people living in the Kremlin. They spend all their time studying ways and methods to communize the world. All peace-loving people will unite with me and hope that these madmen will never launch their massive land and air forces to attack the peaceful world."

### Chen Cheng's Temperature Has Returned to Normal

### District Court Sends People to Inspect Poppy Flowers in Park

[Reported by this newspaper] A report was received recently, accompanied by photos, alleging that poppy flowers were planted next to the fountain in Fuxing Park in this city. The District Court specially dispatched Clerk Deng Jixian to the park at 9:00 yesterday morning to investigate. According to Clerk Deng's investigation report, there was no trace of poppy flowers next to the fountain in the park. The photos showed Oriental Poppy, which has no proper translation in Chinese yet. It belongs to the same family and genus as poppy flowers, but it is a different species, has no toxic substances, and cannot be used to produce opium. There are more than 200 plants of this flower in Fuxing Park. The flower seeds were left over from the former Public Works Bureau. They are sown every March and bloom in May and June.

[Reported by this newspaper] The anti-smuggling personnel of the Jianghai Customs of this city previously seized the Korean smuggling suspect ship "Xi Yu Wan" on the sea on March 31st, carrying nine boxes of ginseng.

The Customs' impartial handling of the above case has been praised and thanked by the original owner of the goods and other Korean residents in this city.

### Municipal Government's Second Inquiry of Jiaotong University Has Been Answered: President Cheng Declares Difference in Standpoint from Municipal Government

[Reported by this newspaper] Jiaotong University President Cheng Xiaogang has issued a response to Mayor Wu's second inquiry regarding the June 5th student anti-Japan parade incident, due to the Municipal Government's urging for an early reply. Some points require further investigation before a response can be made. President Cheng stated that the school's position in handling this incident differs from that of the Municipal Government. He cited an ancient saying to illustrate the school's position as "guiding with virtue and regulating with etiquette," while the Municipal Government's position is "guiding with politics and regulating with punishment," so differences in opinion are inevitable. He does not understand why the Municipal Government has repeatedly inquired of Jiaotong University. Although some graduates participated in the parade that day, they were prevented from leaving the school. He believes that if the mayor also conducts investigations in other schools, the truth may be easier to understand.

### Ban on Trafficking and Sale of Weapon and Ammunition Waste and Parts

[Reported by this newspaper] The Joint Logistics Headquarters believes that weapon and ammunition waste (including copper shell casings) and parts can be used as raw materials for manufacturing weapons and ammunition.

After the Executive Yuan approved it, it issued an order to the entire country to ban it.

### Thirty-Eight Business Associations Telegraph Request to Abolish Property Tax

Thirty-eight business associations in this city, including those representing shipowners, cotton cloth merchants, silk merchants, paper merchants, warehouse operators, insurance companies, oil and fat producers, customs brokers and transporters, woolen fabric merchants, motor vehicle transporters, oil merchants, grain merchants, wine merchants, foil merchants, gold paper and sundry goods merchants, rubber merchants, restaurants, ham merchants, porcelain merchants, department stores, electrical appliance merchants, new medicine merchants, dental equipment merchants, southern goods merchants, automobile parts merchants, bicycle merchants, rice merchants, yarn merchants, booksellers, Western-style clothing merchants, vegetables merchants, scissors merchants, rayon merchants, imported wine and canned goods merchants, biscuit, bread, and candy merchants, lumber merchants, iron merchants, and inland shipping companies, have telegraphed the Legislative Yuan regarding the proposed property tax, requesting its abolition. The telegram stated in brief: The land, its fixtures, houses, their equipment, motor vehicles, ships, goods, and other assets of all industrial and commercial enterprises are merely tools for operational turnover, providing revenue for the nation and livelihoods for the people. If these assets, including both movable and immovable property, are valued and taxed at rates ranging from five to sixty percent, while financial institutions are prohibited from mortgaging machinery, land, and buildings, the only assets available for liquidation are raw materials and finished products. If factories and stores are forced to exhaust all their assets to pay taxes according to the law, how can they continue production and operation? This so-called property tax is nothing short of a death warrant for industry and commerce. Its implementation will inevitably lead to national bankruptcy and widespread unrest. This matter is not merely a superficial concern but a matter of life and death for our associations.

### Central Bank Dispatches Personnel to Beijing and Tianjin to Prevent Outflow of Fluid Capital from North China; Crackdown on Black Market in Gold and Currency Intensified Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] Financial authorities have determined that the recent surge in prices in this city is due to the machinations of fluid capital from North China. The redemption of currency circulating in the Northeast has flooded North China with fluid capital. The high exchange rate between North China and Shanghai has caused fluid capital from North China to flow south in various ways, estimated to reach over 1 trillion National Currency per day. Under these circumstances, the price surge in this city is unprecedented, and the once effective remedies of tightening credit and selling goods to lower prices have proven ineffective. It is now learned that the authorities, in order to address the root cause, have decided to start by preventing the outflow of fluid capital from North China. Wang Zhong, Commissioner of the Northeast Region of the Central Bank, has been summoned to Shanghai to report on the financial situation in the Northeast and North China. Senior officials of the Central Bank have also repeatedly consulted to devise countermeasures and have decided to first dispatch Li Lixia, Xia Jin, Xiong Yuzhong, and others to Beijing and Tianjin in the coming days to strictly monitor and restrict the carrying of cash and remittances, in order to reduce the outflow of funds from the area. Several other plans will be implemented after Yu Hongjun returns to Shanghai from Nanjing. The crackdown on black market transactions in gold and currency in this city began yesterday and is being enforced extremely strictly. Violators will be severely punished regardless of background. The management, price control, and sale of food are also being implemented through a two-pronged approach. In addition, the first batch of U.S. aid supplies is expected to arrive on the 18th, which has already affected market psychology. It is expected that the price surge in June will soon come to an end.

### After Implementation of Price Controls, Top-Quality Rice Disappears from Market; Off-Exchange Bidding Remains High

Rice prices were controlled starting yesterday. The maximum transaction price on the market was not allowed to exceed 9.8 million, and the retail price was not allowed to exceed 10 million. However, as the cost of transporting rice from the production areas to Shanghai exceeded the price control limit, merchants could not sell at a loss and therefore did not sell. Top-quality rice disappeared from the market, and only second-grade indica rice was traded at the controlled price. In the northern market, White Yuan reached 10.08 million, and Shadow Yuan reached 10.02 million, an increase of 500,000 compared to the previous day. Some sellers also offered Shadow Yuan and early rice together, with the early rice at the controlled price, and the price of Shadow Yuan increased to compensate for the insufficient price of early rice. Off-exchange prices continued to be high, with Wuxi prices reaching 11.4 million, and bids being as high as 200,000 to 300,000 higher. Medium-grade white japonica rice was at 10.5 million, and top-grade white japonica rice reached 11.1 million, but there were no transactions. High-quality thin rice was at 10.08 million, with very few transactions. Later, due to the decline in other commodities in the non-agricultural sector, it became softer, and the arrival of goods decreased even more. The volume of trade in the two markets was 648 shi.

### Flour, Grain, and Oilseed Cakes Decline

Flour prices plummeted as before, mainly because the prices of all commodities fell, and merchants were competing to sell at high prices first. Furthermore, credit was slightly tight, and demand weakened sharply. A few early sales still stood at high prices. Old car flour fell from 3.51 million directly to 3.31 million. Warship flour opened at 2.45 million and later fell to 3.3 million due to the selling pressure, a decrease of 200,000 each. Jiancheng and Hongfeng flour fell by more than 200,000 each, bran fell by 200,000, and wheat remained unchanged at 4.7 million.

Edible oil prices experienced a sharp decline. Soybean oil initially stood at 22.7 million, but closed at 22 million. Dachang new soybean oil was at 21.9 million, a decrease of 2.4 million each, a drop of up to 10%. Due to the small amount of stock, there were not many sellers of crude oil, and it only fell slightly by 500,000. Small car sesame oil fell by 1.3 million, vegetable oil fell by 2 million, and soybean cake fell by 200,000 amid frequent dumping by retail investors.

### Market Conditions in Various Regions

The market eased this morning, with the price of cloth averaging a decrease of 2 million, and cigarettes decreased by 200,000 per dan.

### Tea Market Turns from High to Stable

The tea market yesterday turned from rising to stable. The reason for this is the relationship between tight credit and falling prices of all commodities, which caused the sentiment to dissipate. Merchants gradually felt powerless to continue to raise prices. At the close, prices generally moved sideways. Domestic tea sales remained active, with local streets and rural villages absorbing supplies. As for export varieties, the attitude of exporters was hesitant, making it difficult for trading to be clear.

### Sugar Market Begins to Decline

The initial price offered by fellow traders was 14.7 million, later 5 million.

Domestic sugar unanimously softened. The asking price for Shantou Qing was 890,000, with no transactions. Diao Qing was at 400,000, and Xinghua White was at 1 million. The decline was similar to that of red sugar, with no significant difference in cotton red sugar.

### Special Grade Refined White Sugar Quoted and Sold

### Frequent News of Sales; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Experience Sharp Rise and Rapid Decline; Blue Phoenix Fine Yarn Falls by 80 Million Compared to Previous Day

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw continuous sharp increases and prices standing at a peak, causing anxiety. In addition, credit among fellow traders was tight, and more sought to sell for profit, causing buyer demand to weaken.

Forty-two count Blue Phoenix fine yarn opened in the morning, and the market immediately fell by 40 to 50 million because the yarn management committee allocated more fine yarn. Later, it was heard that the cloth market had declined, and the interest in the street weakened, causing the market to fall further to close at 510 million, a decrease of 80 million compared to the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also fell by varying amounts from 30 to 40 million to 80 to 90 million.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw a sudden tightening of credit and various unfavorable news spreading, causing a sudden sense of weakness. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth immediately fell by 400,000.

The morning closing price fell to 70 million, and the opening price in the afternoon fell further to 650 million.

The raw silk market declined yesterday.

Gao Lingzu was priced similarly to Grade E. Qian Jing was strong yesterday because domestic silk was expensive and costs increased, but there were no transactions.

The silk fabric market was uniformly weak yesterday morning. Zhen Silk quilt cover Huaqiang goods opened at 302 million in the morning, once rose to 505 million immediately, and then fell back. The closing price immediately fell to 292 million. The Da Cheng order for plaid crepe, which had been selling well recently, was priced the same as the previous day, but there were no transactions.

### Woolen Fabrics Stable

The woolen fabric market remained stable throughout yesterday, presenting a situation of internal weakness and external strength. Except for Wanli top plies and other summer goods, which were slightly weaker due to the end of the peak sales season and the relationship between the China Trust Bureau's auction, the rest all had gains and no losses.

### Old Buyers Divest, Sentiment Dissipates; Shanghai Stock Market Declines; Government Bonds Surge to New Highs

Although there was a small rise in the middle, it was inevitable that more floating accounts would collapse near noon and sell to 3655 yuan. The noon closing price was 3665 yuan. Except for domestic new shares, which consistently rose to the limit, other stocks unanimously fell sharply by 5% to 10%, except for Xinyi, which did not fall much.

Among the off-market stocks, the world continued to rise, while the rest slightly recovered.

Government bonds surged again yesterday, and new highs were seen. Unified C opened at 570,000, rose to 750,000, and finally struggled around the 600,000 mark. Compared to the previous close, A, B, D, and E each rose by 100,005, Unified C jumped by 115,000, and the turnover was about 4 million.

Foreign stocks also declined yesterday due to a lack of external impetus. The police were still monitoring, inevitably hindering progress.

Our Ministry of Education has issued an order to all public and private colleges and universities with art departments across the country, as well as education departments and bureaus in various provinces and cities, and has sent a letter to the Chinese Artists Association to encourage art students and staff to participate in this competition. The main points of the method are as follows: (1) The theme of the 1948 United Nations Color Poster Competition is to promote social progress and better living standards among the six major freedoms according to the Charter. (2) The competition work in China is the responsibility of the United Nations Office in Shanghai, which is currently hiring experts to form a committee to select three of the posters participating in the competition from our country and submit them to the United Nations Department of Public Information for the International Judging Committee to determine the best works. (3) Participants are limited to professional artists, and each participant can submit one work. (4) The work should be 24 inches high and 18 inches wide, and no more than six colors can be used, including the lettering. It should be sent to the United Nations Office in Shanghai, 106 Huangpu Road, before September 1, 1948. Works that do not meet the size requirements will not be accepted. (5) The prize money is US$1,500 for first place, US$1,000 for second place, and US$500 for third place. There are ten honorary awards, each worth US$100. (6) The copyright and printing rights of the winning posters belong to the United Nations; the rejected works will be returned. However, after the winning works have been determined, outstanding but non-winning works will be selected and retained for a certain period for exhibition for publicity purposes only, and will not be printed without the author's consent. (7) The poster should include a concise slogan, the meaning of which should be consistent with the theme. The number of words should be small and should not be embedded in the important parts of the screen, as it needs to be translated into various other languages. (8) The selection of posters is based on artistic achievement and depth of meaning. Attention should be paid to ensuring that the symbols in the paintings can be understood by people all over the world and should not be biased towards the customs of one country or part of the countries. For example, the white dove is not regarded as a symbol of peace by people all over the world, and the winning posters from last year should not be imitated.

### Far Eastern Games: China and the Philippines Agree to Resume; China-Philippines Games to be Held First in Two Years

[Central News Agency, Manila, 16th] China and the Philippines have decided to hold a sports competition in 1950 as a precursor to a larger and better-organized Far Eastern Games. Hao Gengsheng, the secretary-general of the Chinese National Games, who recently arrived here, discussed the matter with officials of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Association. They agreed that China and the Philippines, as two of the three member countries of the former Far Eastern Athletic Association, should take the lead in reviving the Far Eastern Games. After the sports competition between China and the Philippines in 1950, countries such as India, Siam, Korea, Burma, Indonesia, and Vietnam should be invited to participate in the Far Eastern Games, which would be held every four years. The Far Eastern Games were dissolved in 1934 because Japan insisted on allowing the puppet state of Manchukuo to participate in the competition.

### Refusal to Fly Abroad on China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Plane: Statement from the World Games Delegation

The 14th World Games will open at the end of July in England. Our country's delegation is preparing to depart for the event. In today's difficult political and economic situation in our country, it is truly commendable that our World Games delegation can go abroad and participate in the Games as scheduled. The government's efforts are also deeply appreciated.

Everything about this World Games delegation's trip abroad is good, but there is one thing that is very puzzling and regrettable: the delegation is not flying on a domestic plane but on a foreign plane. Although the delegation's spokesperson has made statements, they are distorting the facts.

First, the Northwest Airlines of the United States, which the delegation has booked, does not have a global route. The company's route only goes as far west as Shanghai and as far east as New York. The length of the route is not even as long as that of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC). In addition to the Sino-US route, CNAC also has a route from Shanghai to India. Currently, no airline can handle a global route on its own. The World Games delegation's trip abroad will in fact require transfers between several airlines; it is impossible to fly on one airline.

Second, the spokesperson for the delegation claimed that our country's planes are bought from abroad, so even flying on a Chinese company's plane would not be thorough enough. This is clearly confusing the aviation industry with the air transport industry. To give a simple example: France and the Netherlands are very active in the international air transport industry. Their Air France and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines have achieved great success, with routes all over the world, but in fact, the planes used by both major companies are bought from the United States. Does this mean that France and the Netherlands cannot have an air transport industry?

CNAC has prepared to offer preferential treatment to the World Games delegation this time. However, the fact is that all the seats on CNAC's future flights from Shanghai to the United States have been sold out. The reason for the strong push is simply to fight for national dignity and win glory for the Chinese people. Now that the delegation has refused to fly on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane, there must be something difficult to say.

As for the claim that the delegation members want to tour New York, CNAC has promised to telegraph local overseas Chinese associations and consulates to arrange hospitality and welcome. CNAC and Pan American World Airways are sister companies, and their coordination and hospitality along the way will certainly not be worse than those of any other company.

Of course, reservations can be canceled. Moreover, the World Games delegation has booked seats on a foreign airline's flights from Shanghai to San Francisco in early July, which is still more than twenty days away. Canceling these seats and switching to CNAC flights would not be a problem at all. The problem lies in whether the delegation is willing to do so.

I remember a story, and I will use it to end this article: One day, a neighbor asked Smith to borrow an ax. Smith told him that he could not lend the ax because he needed it to chop vegetables. Later, Mrs. Smith asked, "Why did you use that reason to refuse the person?" Smith said, "You are so naive. When you intend to refuse something, you can give any reason; there is no need to bother studying it!" (Gu Qixing)

### Talking About Concordance

— Ge Zhaotong

A concordance, also known as a word index, is the most complete form of index. The word "concordance" originally meant "harmony" or "agreement" in Latin, and later gradually evolved to mean concordance. Concordance is different from the general index at the back of a book. The indexes attached to the back of ordinary books are all key word indexes. A concordance is an arrangement of every word or phrase in a book, using the radical method, the stroke method, or the classification method, with clear numbers indicating its source in the original book, and accompanied by the original sentence for reference and checking. For example, the Mao Shi Yin De (Index to the Book of Odes) of the Indexing Office of Yenching University is an excellent concordance. If we want to find which page, chapter, and section a certain sentence in the Book of Odes comes from, we only need to remember one word in the poem. For example, to find the sentence "Zhong Gu Yue Zhi" (bells and drums are played for pleasure) on which page, chapter, and section it comes from, we can find the following entry using the word "Zhong" (bell), "Yue" (pleasure), or "Zhi": "Zhong Gu Yue Zhi 1/1/5," which means that this sentence appears on the first page, first chapter, fifth section of the scripture.

Concordances were initially mostly used in the Bible, and later also widely used in literature. The earliest motivation for compiling a Bible concordance was that many parts of the Bible, all revealed by God, were in agreement with each other and had to be recorded for comparison. Saint Anthony of Padua is generally considered to be the first person to compile a concordance, but the person who actually compiled a Bible concordance is Bishop Hugo. He wanted to annotate the Bible and felt the need to compile a concordance, so he compiled a Bible concordance. Bible concordances have made great contributions to classical scholars, philologists, historians, and religious scholars in reading the Bible.

After the Bible concordance was published, scholars began to compile literary concordances in the same way. To date, many literary concordances have been compiled. From the ancient Propan Tas, Virgil, Horace, to Shelley, Spencer, Goethe, Herstriot, Panhens, Keats, Kilbermoth, Macaulay, Newman and other famous literary works have been compiled with concordances. Scholars find it very convenient to use. The first Shakespeare concordance was compiled by Ascott in 1790, and the standard edition compiled by Mrs. Clarke was published in London in 1845; Butler published a better Shakespeare concordance in New York in 1894. The Milton concordance was published in Madras in 1856. The Tennyson concordance was published in London in 1870. Feis's Dante concordance was published in Kingston in 1889. The Chaucer Society of London published the Chaucer concordance in 1872. Abbott published the Pope concordance in 1875. Nevill published the Cooper poetry concordance in 1887. Cook published the Crow concordance in 1909. Pearce published the Dickens concordance in 1898. Molinieux published the Browning concordance in New York in 1896. The author lists the concordances compiled in European and American countries to prove how much European and American countries value academic data and how meticulous they are in research methods.

The work of compiling concordances in our country's academic circles is just in its infancy. Among the famous works compiled into concordances, there are only Ye Shaojun's Thirteen Classics Index, Zhouyi Yin De (Index to the Book of Changes) of the Indexing Office of Yenching University, Mao Shi Yin De (Index to the Book of Odes), Chunqiu Jingzhuan Yin De (Index to the Spring and Autumn Annals and Commentaries), Erya Yin De (Index to the Erya), Mengzi Yin De (Index to the Mencius), Lunyu Yin De (Index to the Analects), Du Shi Yin De (Index to Du Fu's Poetry) (Japanese Iijima Tadao and Fukuda Fukuichiro also compiled a Du Shi Index, which indexes by the last word of each sentence, but it is not widely used), He Lixian's Bible Classification (published by Shanghai Puyi Book Society, which compiles sentences with the same word in the Bible into one category and arranges them according to the number of strokes, as an index) and so on. The Indexing Office of Yenching University also has a Liji Yin De (Index to the Book of Rites), which is between a key word index and a concordance, because the function words or conjunctions in the original book are all omitted. The so-called pure concordance should also arrange function words and conjunctions. From this, it can be seen that the work of compiling concordances is still a pioneering work in our country. Not only are there very few books compiled into concordances, but there are also not many scholars who know and use concordances. This is because it is still unfamiliar in China. Therefore, we should vigorously promote the compilation and use of concordances, so that scholars have the opportunity to thoroughly examine the important books of ancient and modern times and delve into the contents of various subjects. This saves scholars a lot of time and energy in their studies, and the benefits are also great.

### Atomic Bombardment and the Atomic Bomb

— Wang Qande

Original by John K. Robertson, translated by Wen Shengchang, published by World Book Company

Since the invention of atomic weapons and the continuous research on the industrial application of atomic energy, human attention to atomic energy has become more and more intense and more frightening. The recent invention of the American atomic radiation cloud has added another fear of death to human life.

However, these atomic bombs and atomic radiation are all caused by atomic nuclei and neutrons (Nevtron) - an uncharged particle that is the central molecule that constitutes the atomic nucleus - playing tricks there. The atomic nucleus is like a magician, changing this way for a while and changing that way again. In this ever-changing process, it releases the so-called "Atomic Energy," and this released atomic energy has killed countless people, but conversely, it has saved countless victims, because if it were not for the atomic bomb, the Second World War would probably not have ended today!

"Atomic Bombardment and the Atomic Bomb," originally titled Atomic Artillery and the Atomic Bomb, is written in popular language and answers questions raised by the general public. The arrangement is also organized, divided into fourteen chapters, from the latest "Matter is composed of particles" to "The Atomic Bomb." Wherever possible, the author uses ordinary words to replace specialized terms, and sometimes there are some interesting titles in the book, which are all wonderful ways to make readers interested.

In the process of the atomic bomb explosion, the most important thing is of course the "atomic projectile." The so-called atomic projectile is just like the gunpowder in an ordinary bomb. If there is no gunpowder, the bomb cannot explode. Similarly, in an atomic bomb, if there is no projectile, the enormous atomic energy cannot be released.

The electron is the lightest projectile and also the earliest discovered basic particle - because the atoms of every element have electrons rotating around the atomic nucleus, just like the earth revolving around the sun in the solar system - but the mass of the electron is too light, and it does not leave any damage when it passes through thin metal sheets, so it is not suitable. These are introduced very clearly in Chapter Three.

Chapter Four, "A Heavier Projectile: Positive Rays." First, it talks about the discovery of positive rays, and then introduces the proton (Proto). Although the proton is not a very suitable particle, it is much better than the electron. The most brilliant part of this chapter is the "interconversion of mass and energy," which introduces Einstein's law and gives an example. This example is not like general esoteric theories, but allows people to thoroughly understand the great significance of Einstein's definition when they read it. The book writes, "...According to the law derived from his theory of relativity (1) When the energy of an object increases, its mass also increases. (2) Every secret form of energy is equivalent to a certain mass." This is also E=MC2. In this formula, E represents energy, m represents the mass of an object, and C2 represents the square of the speed of light. This chapter is also the most brilliant chapter in the whole book, because "relativity" is the center of modern thought, just like Newton's law of universal gravitation before. If Einstein's equation can be widely applied one day, then human happiness will be truly shallow, just like the book says "...Then the energy obtained from destroying an ounce of coal can provide the electricity needed by 250,000 people for a year."

"No mass of matter," the title of this sixth child seems very strange, but it is not. It is just introducing the text of photon Pboton, because "In free space, sometimes light must also be regarded as a small ball of concentrated energy, which is today called a photon. A photon is a particle, or a radiating particle, that has a certain amount of energy and travels in space at a speed of 186,000 miles per second (i.e., the speed of light)."

"Manufacturing Giant Cannons for Bombarding Atoms" is the theme of Chapter Eight. Just like we want to fire bullets of various sizes, we have to use various weapons, such as field guns, mortars, and long-range cannons. Similarly, atomic giant cannons also have several different forms, such as the Van de Groaff electrostatic accelerator and the Cyclotron invented by Professor Lawrence. These are two extremely important tools, and the book has detailed descriptions of these two tools.

"Nuclear Fission and Serial Reaction" can be said to be the most important page in the study of the atomic bomb, because if the nucleus cannot be split, the success of the atomic bomb is undoubtedly a fantasy. Furthermore, if the chain is impossible, in other words, the atomic bomb cannot have such a great salty power, which is the theme of Chapter Thirteen.

The last chapter, which is Chapter Fourteen, talks about the "Atomic Bomb," and incidentally talks about a new element, plutonium, and the manufacturing plants in this regard, but this chapter does not talk about much material, because the atomic bomb itself is fundamentally a military secret, and the US government restricts its publication, so this of course cannot be said to be a shortcoming of the book.

The rest, such as "Cosmic Rays," "Modern Alchemy," "The Structure of the Atomic Nucleus," etc., have also read a lot, and what is even more brilliant is the appendix, which has many valuable photos that are difficult to find in ordinary books, and the printing is also quite clear.

Therefore, anyone who needs to understand the truth about the "Atomic Age" must read this book.

### 100 Tables for Practical Use of Spoken English

— Zhu Fang

Written by Harold E. Palmer
Translated and compiled by Zhang Peilin
Published by Kaiming Bookstore

Before introducing the contents of this book, I should repeat the author's explanation of "practical use": "Replacing any word in any fixed sentence (Authentic sentence) with another word with the same grammatical structure and similar meaning can produce countless new sentences. This method is called practical use (Substitution)."

This book is compiled based on this method, and each table can produce at least 100 or more sentences, and the most can reach 60,000 to 70,000 or even more than 100,000 sentences. Therefore, it is not easy to compile this kind of book, and it must make each sentence as applicable as possible.

In addition, the compiler has also added a "chapter vocabulary," a "vocabulary index," and a "verb table," which are indeed quite helpful for self-learners.

If you read this book carefully, you will definitely get a lot of benefits in terms of listening and reading, because there is a phonetic table of international sound numbers in front of each table, and his phonetic transcription is not individual, but based on the principle of organizational elements in the sentence. The (Linking) of each sentence's pronunciation and the elimination of fast reading are also noted.

If you are a student who wants to make progress in listening and speaking, I advise him to buy it and read it quickly. At present, this is a rare book.

### Reading "Fundamental Education"

— Erli

Edited by the UNESCO, translated by Wang Chengxu, published by Commercial Press

The first volume of this book was published in September last year, just when the Far East Regional Conference on Fundamental Education was held in Nanjing, and the second volume was published in March of this year. The people of the country can therefore get a glimpse of the whole picture of this classic in the world's fundamental education movement. This book can be said to be a collective creation, written by dozens of experts and scholars in the field of fundamental education in the world, and then compiled into this book by the special editorial committee of the education group of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Therefore, in terms of content, it is rich and consistent, and worth reading carefully.

The greatest value of this book is that readers can read articles by many experts in these two small volumes. Most of these articles are incorporated into this book in whole or in part of the original text. The record of the current situation of fundamental education in various countries in the first volume is compiled from the reports of experts on education in the relevant countries. For example, the fundamental education of the Soviet Union was written by Mrs. Kim, who has published several specialized books on Soviet education; the fundamental education of the French colonies was written by Mr. Chatton, a supervisor of the French government's colonial department; the fundamental education of India was written by Mr. Chitre Singh, the editor of the Indian Adult Education Magazine; the fundamental education of Mexico was written by Ms. Torres, who worked in the Mexican rural education and cultural mission. As for the contents of the second volume, they are even more exciting. American anthropologist Ms. Mitt wrote an article on fundamental education and cultural values, proposing that fundamental education should preserve the cultures of all ethnic groups, and suggesting that China should express its own views on education at the World Education Conference. Ms. Reed, Associate Professor of Education at the University of London, UK, wrote an article on the goals of fundamental education, analyzing several important concepts in fundamental education, and proposing a philosophical basis for fundamental education. Professor Kandel, an American expert in comparative education, wrote an article on literacy and beyond, explaining that literacy is not the ultimate goal of fundamental education. Many acts of aggression in the world are committed by so-called culturally more advanced ethnic groups. Mr. Zhao Yuanren wrote an article on Chinese language teaching problems, analyzing the content of language teaching, and describing the past, present, and future of the vernacular movement and writing reform, which is especially worth reading by the Chinese people. World linguistics experts Ogden and Richards have also written special articles. The gathering of these experts is unmatched by general books.

Another value of this book is that the materials in this book are not commonly seen in general books on education. Usually, books on comparative education or texts introducing the educational situation of foreign countries are mostly about the education of several major countries such as Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France. The many countries described in the first volume of this book are the opposite. Fundamental education should of course refer to the basic education of every ethnic group, but the object of fundamental education described in this book is ethnic groups with relatively backward cultural education. Mr. Chatton proposed the concept of the educational black belt in the second volume of this book. According to his view, educationally backward countries in the world can be divided into four zones, namely the Far East, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The countries described in the first volume of this book, starting from the Americas, include Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, and Mexico. Then, the fundamental education of Africa is described, describing French West Africa and the Union of South Africa. Reminding everyone to pay attention to backward countries is unparalleled by other books.

### Prosaic Long Poem: Eugene Onegin

— Translated by 頡頫

There are two types of typical literary figures: one is synthesized from existing characters of a certain class, such as Ah Q and Kong Yiji by Mr. Lu Xun. For this type of character, the author often predicts (or indicates) the path they should take in the future based on their existing shortcomings. For example, regarding Kong Yiji, Mr. Lu Xun bluntly said, "Without him, people would still live the same way," implying that old intellectuals would inevitably break out of the circle of helping others—to make it so that people cannot "live the same way" without him. The other type of typical character is created by the author through observing the development of social trends, such as Bazarov in Turgenev's "Fathers and Sons" and Eugene Onegin in Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin." When Pushkin's long poem "Eugene Onegin," consisting of over six thousand lines, was first published, there was no such character as Eugene Onegin in Russian aristocratic society. Therefore, critics heavily attacked him. However, soon there were countless Eugene Onegins in Imperial Russian society. Even in China, one hundred and twenty years later, there are many such characters.

In this poetic novel "Eugene Onegin," poetry and novel are most harmoniously combined, reaching the highest peak of narrative poetry. It is the first cornerstone of Soviet literature and art; it is a flourishing tree with deep roots in the Russian people. Gogol, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Gorky, and others have all rested under this tree, absorbing the fragrance of poetry.

Although "Eugene Onegin" is such a great work, its plot is not too complicated.

The protagonist, Eugene Onegin, is a vain and proud young nobleman. Due to his sense of superiority or hypocrisy, he indifferently views all his actions, whether good or bad, as the same. His uncle summons him to a village with a will, where he inherits vast estates and serfs. He is seen by his neighbors as a dangerous fellow because he reduces the corvée labor of the tenants and self-importantly avoids visits from his neighbors. He is only close to another young nobleman, the poet Lensky. One day, Lensky takes Onegin to his fiancée's house. His fiancée is a woman "who can be seen in any romance novel." She has a sister, Tatyana, a noble, pale, and idealistic young woman, whom Pushkin calls "my ideal, the soul of Russia." As soon as she sees Onegin, she immediately falls in love with him. She writes a letter to Onegin, saying that she will always belong to him. However, Onegin, who is usually romantic, rejects her with a lecture full of moralistic and superior airs because of his pride or because he sees through women's deceit. As a result, she becomes restless all day long and becomes even paler.

At this time, Lensky is deeply in love with his fiancée. Once, he invites Onegin to Tatyana's name-day party on behalf of his future in-laws. The noise of the party and Tatyana's distress because of him all arouse Onegin's dissatisfaction. Therefore, he suddenly feels resentment towards his friend's invitation; he feels he should take revenge. When the dance begins, he clings to the poet's fiancée until the end of the ball. At this time, the poet becomes furious; he feels he must decide his fate with a pistol—he wants to duel with Onegin. So, the next day, both sides draw their guns in the open field… and Onegin kills his friend.

Soon after the poet's death, his fiancée marries a military officer. And her sister, Tatyana, becomes even more haggard because of the loss of her sister's companionship and because Onegin travels abroad out of remorse for killing his friend. Therefore, her mother takes her to Moscow, to the "market of unmarried girls," to display her like merchandise. Sure enough, she is soon appreciated by a distinguished general and marries him.

Years later, she sees Onegin again at a ball. At this time, she is no longer a country girl but a graceful and luxurious young woman. Onegin begins to pursue her madly. He writes letters to her repeatedly, but all are met with stern rejection, just as Onegin had rejected her before. Therefore, Onegin begins to turn pale, and he shuts himself up in his house all winter. When the following spring comes, he visits her again. She is in tears, reading those letters he had given her before. It turns out that she still loves him! But to fulfill her husband's position, to be a virtuous wife and loving mother, she still sacrifices her love...

The story ends here; but what never ends is Tatyana's pale, frank, and bright heart and her great spirit of sacrifice. (Note: Translated by Lu Ying, hoping to publish.)

### Shen Bao, Renhe Hospital, Baoli Hospital, Red Cross Hospital, Shangxian Maternal and Child Hospital, and Huisheng Obstetrics Hospital Jointly Organize "Free Childbirth Assistance" Approved List of Pregnant Women (23)

### Wang Lan Ying Seeks Her Father

Mr. Wang Jinchen from Puyang, Hebei, Please Note

Editor: Four years ago, I rescued a small girl named Wang Lan Ying, who was completely covered in wounds and being abused, from a stationmaster with the surname Liu in Gaozhai, Puyang County, Hebei. Her father's name is Wang Jinchen (who was a merchant in Nanjing at the time). Lan Ying was living with her maternal grandmother. It was a year of famine, so her maternal grandmother decided to give her to the stationmaster surnamed Liu. Because the Liu's wife was unreasonable and he was afraid of his wife, he beat her several times a day. I couldn't stand this abuse, so I took her away. She is now fifteen years old and very smart. I plan to find her father so that they can be reunited. I hope your editor will sympathize and publish this, and hope that Wang Jinchen from Puyang will come to Huang Yousan, First Division, 5245 Unit, Suqian, after seeing the newspaper to recognize his daughter and fulfill my wish. With best wishes. Sincerely, Huang Yousan, June 1st.

Newspaper Awaiting Collection: On the afternoon of June 4th, a rickshaw puller named Wang Bocheng brought two reams of blank newsprint, claiming that a certain gentleman loaded two reams of newspapers at the Old West Gate and instructed him to deliver them to the intersection of Kangding Road and Jiaozhou Road. The gentleman accompanied him on a bicycle, but he lost contact with him halfway and could not find him. He went to the destination, but there was no sign of him. He could not deliver the paper, so he sent the paper for safekeeping and asked for a notice to be published to find the owner. Please publish this notice in your newspaper so that the owner can collect the paper at the office of this security within one week. Sincerely, Fan Weiping, 80th Security Section, Songshan District, Office of the Security Section at Anshunli Entrance, Jianguo East Road, June 5th.

### Erhu

— Dunming

Someone downstairs is playing the erhu, squeaking and moaning. I don't know why, but I always feel that the sound of the erhu carries endless fatigue and anxiety, which is different from the shrillness of the jinghu. Liu Tianhua's erhu scores include "Sickbed Lament" and "Starving Horse Rattle Bell." I think he saw through the melancholic characteristics of the erhu's timbre.

The squeaking sound is intermittent. Only an old black and white cat in the courtyard is listening with half-open eyes. It only paid a little attention to the slowly falling poplar catkins, but when it saw that they were not edible, it lazily lay down again.

The first person to tell me about Liu Tianhua's name was Lao Shen. Not only was he a good erhu player, but he was also a volleyball player who had attended the North China Games. But he looked just like a peasant who had just come from the countryside. His hair was always so disheveled, and his gray robe was always so crumpled. When he spoke, he had a heavy accent from the suburbs of Nanjing—if he hadn't told me, no one would have believed that he was studying foreign literature at the most "Westernized" university in the country.

Classmates were busy attending social tea parties at the professors' houses, learning to speak English with ridiculous Oxford accents everywhere. Some held thick books in their rooms, and "matter-of-factly" held pipes in their mouths... But Lao Shen leisurely played the erhu. The quilt on his bed was scattered in a mess, and occasionally the corner of a complete works of Shakespeare would peek out from under the quilt. The professors asked questions in the classroom, and Lao Shen's answers were always slow, repetitive, and full of mistakes—the Shakespeare in the quilt seemed to be of no help to him other than putting him to sleep.

So, also at a time when poplar catkins were flying, we had our big exams. The big exams that year were particularly early because the situation in North China was tense, and the universities in Peiping hurriedly ended the semester.

That time, the most difficult subject was comparative linguistics, because there were countless "laws" that had to be memorized, and the examples proving these laws ranged from Sanskrit all the way to Northern European and French and Italian, and a few "strings" had to be memorized. Latin, of course, goes without saying. During these few days, almost everyone in our class was muttering to themselves, like madmen, just silently reciting what the first "Grimm's Law" was, what Jespersen's explanation was, and what Bloomfield's revision was. They even felt that the ceiling was full of various phonetic symbols when they were lying in bed.

Lao Shen was still playing the erhu, but he no longer played complete scores. Sometimes he would play two sentences and then stop. Someone looked at him from the window of the opposite room. It turned out that although he still held the erhu in his hand, his eyes were staring at his notebook.

On the day of the exam, the questions were unexpectedly easy. After the exam, everyone compared their answers in the campus, arguing very lively. Even Professor B, who was invigilating the exam, came over with a smile to discuss. She said that she had never seen American students so serious. After talking for a long time, she suddenly pointed at someone and said.

"Ah, I can't recognize you at all! Aren't you an athlete?"

We turned around and saw Lao Shen. His dark face was thin and haggard, and his eyes were red. He looked just like someone suffering from a serious illness!

He said he was not feeling well, could not sleep, and walked away listlessly.

As soon as I returned to the dormitory, I heard that squeaking sound again. I pushed open the door and walked into Lao Shen's room. He nodded to me blankly and pointed slightly to the table with the hand holding the erhu. He bared his teeth and smiled.

On the table was a copy of De Quincey's "Confessions of an English Opium-Eater."

He saw the puzzled look on my face and laughed loudly. He said, "There's no way! I can't keep up with you guys. I'm not even sure if I can pass!"

He had pulled three consecutive all-nighters, and his energy was not good, so he learned from De Quincey!

I couldn't help but be stunned by this volleyball star who was famous for "shutting down" Beiping. But he smiled again and started playing "Sickbed Lament"...

### Wireless Television

— Lichu

In the near future, schoolchildren will be able to attend school in their own homes, presidential candidates will campaign in wireless television broadcasting studios, housewives can select clothes from wireless television and then make transactions over the phone, movie theaters will be deserted, and wireless radio will be as outdated as an autumn fan—so predict those in the United States who are familiar with wireless television.

Currently, there are only twenty-seven wireless television broadcasting stations in the United States (there are a total of one thousand six hundred wireless radio broadcasting stations), and only three hundred and twenty-five thousand wireless television sets (there are a total of more than sixty million wireless radios). Most of the wireless television sets are owned by residents of New York.

But this emerging industry is expanding. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the United States will have one million wireless television sets, sixty broadcasting stations, and the first coast-to-coast wireless television network in the United States will be completed in 1950. If the trend does not change, by 1954 the United States will have sixteen million wireless television sets and sixty-five million users.

Although the principle of wireless television was discovered as early as the end of the nineteenth century, the first real wireless television set was not officially launched until the New York World's Fair in 1939. (The wireless television set created by the British Broadcasting Corporation using many American materials was completed three years before.) Then the war broke out, and this "scientific toy" was put on hold for five years. When it was re-researched after the war, a technical problem arose, namely, whether to start improving color television or black-and-white television first. After several discussions, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission decided to start with black-and-white television first.

Like wireless radio when it first became popular, wireless television has had a huge impact on American life. Young women who used to spend all day with their boyfriends now stay at home—she invites her boyfriend home to watch television together. Naughty children no longer cause trouble outside. The best thing is that once a family has a wireless television set, it will be full of guests every day, so that the host cannot bear the burden of entertaining them and has to ask these guests to bring their own snacks.

This year happens to be the year of the presidential election in the United States, and candidates are also competing to meet voters in front of wireless television. The following are the results published by the American "Broadcasting" magazine: Truman, Vandenberg, and Wallace did the best; Dewey's small mustache, Stetson's youth, and MacArthur's baldness all had a slight impact on their results, but they were still able to "pass." The worst was Taft, whose "image" was not beautiful and whose speech was monotonous.

After wireless television became popular, the outlet for wireless radio was limited to the blind and busy housewives. In addition, it only had a place in cars. (There are currently nine million three hundred thousand car radios in the United States.)

### On Specialization

— Shuofu

I read the following sentence in a collection of essays and literary criticism by the American writer Addington: "Often thinking of more than half a dozen things at the same time." I find it quite thought-provoking. If a person can complete six or seven things at the same time, he can definitely achieve six to seven times more than ordinary people. In terms of writing, if a writer writes a short essay while dictating a novel to a stenographer and conceives the plot of another play in his mind, then this person's output in writing is enough to match that of two or three writers.

At first, I admired this sentence very much. Extending it, if a person can live the lives of six or seven people in his life, wouldn't his experience be richer? Wouldn't life be more meaningful? Therefore, I also ventured to try a similar compact life. While I was compiling a textbook on economics beyond my capacity, I was also translating a long story for a magazine. In the meantime, I also took some time to write some small articles.

But in this way, my nerves were often very tense, and I often had toothaches and other phenomena. Gradually, I discovered that I was committing the fault of not being able to specialize. Fortunately, I discovered it early and restored the principle of doing only one thing at a time, and my mind immediately felt much lighter.

Indeed, working with concentration can give you a feeling of ease in spirit. For example, if you want to translate a novel, put the textbooks on economics principles, business management, etc. together in the bookcase. On your desk, just put an original book and tools such as English and French dictionaries. Writing at the desk naturally gives you a relaxed state of mind, and the speed of translation is also doubled. We can even say that specialization is the key to solving difficult problems.

### Officials Close to the People

— Tongtuo

When Mayor La Guardia first arrived in New York, he went to the police station to visit the investigation court. At that time, it was the poor winter, and the police station brought in an unemployed person who had committed the crime of stealing bread. The only defense was that his family was starving.

"I should punish you," said La Guardia. "Because the law has no exceptions. I now pronounce: your theft should be fined ten dollars."

La Guardia then reached into his pocket and said, "The money here is to pay your fine for you. But—" La Guardia took off his wide-brimmed straw hat and threw ten banknotes into it. "... But everyone in this room, I want them to be fined fifty cents, because there is one person in their society who has to steal bread to have something to eat."

He took the hat and passed it from person to person in the court, and then poured this pile of clanging coins into the hands of the surprised and delighted defendant.

### Talking About "Wife"

It is commonly said that one's own wife is called "laopo" (老婆), which sounds very unpleasant. According to Wen Yun: "Po (婆), extravagance, one says old mother is called," so po is the name of an old woman. Now, if the word "lao (老)" is added before "po (婆)", wouldn't it become "laolaoyong (老老媼)"? One must be at least eighty years old to deserve this title; but now even young people are called "laopo (老婆)", which is extremely jarring! However, this term already existed in Song Dynasty poems, such as Wang Jinqing's poem "The old woman is anxiously persuading me."

There is a humble way to call one's own wife "neiren (內人)," but this is also not very appropriate. According to the Tang Dynasty, the prostitutes of Jiaofang were selected into Yichunyuan, which was called "neiren (內人)," which meant that the neiren became the emperor's concubine! Tang Zhang You has the sentence "The neiren has already sung the spring oriole's trill" to prove it. Since "neiren (內人)" cannot be used, it is better to call "neizi (內子)," because "zi (子)" can also be used for women. Didn't Confucius meet with Weiling Gong's wife, Nanzi, which made Zilu very angry! (You Mo Jun)

In the Russo-Japanese War of 1904, the Qing government had already declared neutrality, and the Japanese forcibly entered Chinese territory and arrested Russian ships that had disarmed, causing General Sa Zhenbing to be punished by the Governor-General, which was also a regrettable incident. On July 8th of the 30th year of Guangxu, Beiyang Minister Yuan Shikai reported that according to Admiral Sa Zhenbing, who was in charge of the Beiyang Navy, at 4:15 on the first day of July, a Russian torpedo boat entered the neutral area of ​​Yantai. Admiral Sa immediately sent personnel to board the boat to inquire, dismantled the boat's artillery, torpedoes, and machinery, and signed a guarantee that it would not participate in the war and would not fly the Russian flag. After our navy supervised the completion, it was led to Xia'ao and guarded by another Hai Rong ship. At 7 o'clock, two Japanese torpedo boats entered the port. The Admiral personally went to the Japanese boat and told them that the Russian boat's weapons had been unloaded. The Japanese captain agreed to leave soon. Unexpectedly, at 3 o'clock in the morning on the second day, more than 30 Japanese soldiers boarded the Russian boat. The Hai Rong ship tried to stop them but they did not listen. They then towed the Russian boat away. The Admiral immediately raised the flag to order them to stop the wheel, but those who towed the Russian boat ignored them. One stopped the wheel, and the Admiral sent the Haiqi warship to the Deputy Captain to tell them that the Russian ship had been unloaded and should not be towed away. The Japanese captain replied that he would rush to inform the front ship and tow the Russian boat back, but he never returned. Admiral Sa Zhenbing had handled the Russian boat's entry into the port in accordance with public law, but because he lightly believed the Japanese, the Russian boat was towed away by the Japanese boat. Although he had tried to stop them in many ways, he was ultimately unable to protect them. In addition to telegraphing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to investigate with the Japanese ambassador, he should ask the Emperor to order Sa Zhenbing to be handed over to the Ministry of War for discussion and punishment to show a warning. This incident can also be regarded as a scene of the Japanese showing their true colors. Their behavior is unreasonable, and their words are full of deceit. Even if they abuse their power, there is no straightforward and bright demeanor.

The July 7th Incident marked the official start of the War of Resistance. Before the July 7th Incident, the Japanese deliberately provoked trouble, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, insulting the people and obstructing government orders, causing trouble everywhere. After the "September 18th" Incident, the three northeastern provinces were occupied, and Tianjin and Hebei-Shandong provinces lost their defenses, exposing themselves to the wall. The Japanese were free to act, and many illegal vagrants were sent to the customs to entice and deceive with drugs and gambling, etc. The most commonly played trick was to create so-called "faits accomplis" at any time, that is, the evil customs of "plundering as property, forcing marriage," regardless of laws or treaties, or after invading or plundering, they considered it natural to have occupied and plundered. It was hateful and abrupt.

### Recent Poems by Xia'an

— Ye Gongchuo

After I returned to my hometown, I closed my doors and never went out. During the Dragon Boat Festival in the old lunar calendar, the sound of drums from the dragon boat races on the Pearl River never stopped. People say that this year the villagers can expect a good harvest, so the dragon boats are particularly prosperous. Therefore, I composed a poem.

Twenty miles along the river, the midday drums are noisy, temporarily rejoicing at the abundant harvest and forgetting worries. I have long had no competition in my heart for empty boats, and I close myself in my empty studio, thinking of Qu Yuan.

Rejoicing that the Liu Mengjin Stele Returns South

Why bother to compare the rise and fall of the Six Dynasties, and rejoice that a piece of stone has returned to Hanling. Feiyuan's spirit is very clear, but I regret that Wang Xuecheng's return trip was interrupted. (It is said that Gan Hanshen Weng once dreamed of his daughter, saying that the stone would return to Guangdong, and the next day Yu Fan arrived, and he returned Yu Fan. It is estimated that it has been nearly forty years since Wang Xuecheng transported it to Shanghai in the Xinhai year.)

Nanda's inscriptions are hard to preserve, and my lifelong habit of collecting antiques has been given up. I am even more touched by the former dream of the Banyan Garden, and I want to ask Zhang Qian about the location. (When Hong Kong fell, I was managed by the Japanese and sold things for rice. The Zhao Hu tomb and Han Nanhai Jun Hu, which are about Cantonese documents, and the Jin Zhang Qian tomb farewell, all changed hands.)

Editor's Note: The above three recent poems by Mr. Ye Yuhu were recently sent from Guangdong to Shanghai. We are very happy to receive them from Mr. Lu Danlin. Mr. Lu also added a note saying that the Feiyuan mentioned in the poem is the name of Gan Hanshen's garden in Pudong, Shanghai, Wang Xuecheng is Wang Bing'en, and the Banyan Garden is Jian Yu Fan (also Wen), a room name in Xuhui, Shanghai. Gan Hanshen and Wang Xuecheng have both passed away, and the Banyan Garden has also changed hands recently.
