[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 22nd] The President has now flown to Xi'an. Director Hu Zongnan, Deputy Director Gao Guizi, Chairman Wang Zongshan, Senior Advisor Shi Jingting, Xi'an Garrison Commander Cao Rihui, and others were all at the airport to greet him.

[Our Dispatch, Xuzhou, 22nd] The defending troops of Kaifeng are still firmly holding key positions today, including Henan University, the Catholic Church, and Longding.

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] According to a military news dispatch from Zhengzhou at 7:00 PM on the 22nd: The fighting within Kaifeng City seemed to have quieted down on the afternoon of the 22nd. According to an air force report, apart from sporadic artillery fire near the strongholds, the battle situation was not as intense as in previous days. The bandits are looting supplies. On the 22nd, large military trucks transporting goods south through the Chichangzhen area south of Kaifeng were continuously traveling, but many were bombed and destroyed by the air force. Fierce fighting is currently taking place in areas 30 to 50 li outside of Kaifeng. Reinforcements are arriving at the outskirts of the city. It seems the bandits are withdrawing south to avoid encirclement, due to the powerful Nationalist army corps attacking from Lanfeng and Zhongmu in separate routes. Although telecommunications within the city are currently interrupted, it is generally believed that important strongholds are still firmly held by the Nationalist army.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 22nd] The Battle of Kaifeng reached its most intense stage on the 22nd. The Nationalist army and Henan provincial security forces, who are resolutely defending the northwest of the city walls in the area of Henan University, Longting, the Iron Pagoda, the sports field, and the Catholic Church, continued to display their tenacious and extraordinary spirit before 5:00 PM today, engaging in the sixth day of bayonet-to-bayonet bloodbath with the bandits. A portion of the strong, middle-aged civil servants and residents in the city also volunteered to join the front lines, demonstrating a high degree of military-civilian cooperation, making the greatest and final efforts to defend this ancient city of the Central Plains. Since last night, the bandits have concentrated their entire force, launching repeated fierce charges against the defenders' positions using human wave tactics. The military and civilians who are resolutely defending the various strongholds in the northwest of the city walls are not discouraged by the small number of people and the limited area. Relying on the existing fortifications, they fought bravely, losing and regaining ground repeatedly. Since this morning, the sounds of fighting in the northwest of the city walls have shaken the sky, and the battle has become increasingly fierce. As of 5:00 PM this afternoon, the fighting was still in a state of melee.

[Another Dispatch] The Nationalist army reinforcements from the west and east, under the powerful air force's day and night cover, overcame the bandits' blockades in Zhongmu and Lanfeng, and are advancing rapidly towards Kaifeng, and will be able to encircle it by tonight. A large-scale annihilation battle will follow the defense battle and begin on the outskirts of Kaifeng.

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] The elite troops of the Nationalist army advancing eastward from Zhengzhou, in a day-long battle near Zhongmu on the 21st, defeated three regiments of Chen Geng's bandit forces, killing or wounding 3,000 bandits and capturing over 100 alive.

Among them, in addition to a part participating in the attack on Kaifeng, another part is attempting to block the Nationalist army reinforcements from the eastern section of the Longhai Railway east of Lanfeng to support Kaifeng.

[Our Dispatch, Jinan, 22nd] The battle of Yanzhou has resumed since the 20th. The invading bandits are one division of the 7th column from the east of the city, and the entire 8th column from the north of the city. As of the 22nd, fierce fighting is still ongoing. In addition, the bandits in Wande forcibly conscripted 2,000 laborers to carry out large-scale bridge destruction and road digging.

### Gubeikou Stands Firm; Nationalist Army Recaptures Shixia Yesterday Afternoon

Troops rushing from Ping (Beiping) along the Ping-Gu line to reinforce have reached the vicinity of Xiaoying at 4:00 PM on the 22nd. It is reported that the bandit 3rd column in the Shixia and Xiaoying areas shows signs of collapse.

[Our Dispatch, Qinhuangdao, 22nd] After suffering setbacks in their attack on Chengde, Li Tiaochan's bandit 8th and 11th columns have retreated to the Chaoyang area for reorganization.

On the night of the 21st, the bandit Suizhong detachment destroyed the railway between Suizhong and Huangdi and destroyed two or three small bridges.

### Legislative Yuan to Hold Provisional Meeting Tomorrow to Review the Central Plains Campaign

Request that He Yingqin attend and report

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] In the afternoon session of the Legislative Yuan on the 22nd, a provisional motion proposed by Zheng Zhenyu and others was passed, resolving to convene a provisional meeting on the 24th to review the reasons for and responsibilities for the setbacks in the Central Plains campaign. The Minister of National Defense, He Yingqin, was requested to attend and report and be prepared to answer questions. When explaining the case, Zheng pointed out that the Kaifeng battle was due to incorrect pre-battle judgments, poor temporary dispatching, and the inability of local commanders to command. All units above the regiment level had to be directly commanded by the central government, coupled with unclear rewards and punishments, and confusion between right and wrong, which allowed the communists to take advantage. We should thoroughly review this to benefit all future military campaigns. Furthermore, the review meeting on the 24th is considered a military secret, and reporters are not allowed to attend.

[Another Dispatch] Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang told representatives of the Henan petitioners that the central government has decided to allocate a large sum of money to relieve the refugees in Henan Province, and has requested the Executive Yuan to allocate 100 billion yuan.

### Several Key Members of the Kuomintang Gather; Sincerely Hope for Cooperation Between the Three Parties; Decide to Find Ways to Incrementally Increase the Number of Seats for Youth Party Legislators

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] Because Kuomintang President Chiang Kai-shek was on inspection on the 21st, the seven opinions submitted by the Youth Party through Lei Zhen had not been reviewed. Several key members of the Kuomintang, including Wu Tiecheng, conducted preliminary research at the Central Party Headquarters at 9:00 PM on the 22nd. In addition to continuing to step up efforts on the issue of the number of seats for Youth Party legislators, and finding ways to incrementally increase them, for the remaining points, either due to the constitutional political system and party relations being different from before, or due to the fact that it is difficult to determine a deadline for their achievement, it is necessary to wait for the President to return to Beijing to ask for instructions before conducting further research. However, those who attended all had extremely sincere hopes for cooperation between the three parties, and especially hoped that the Youth Party could recommend candidates for Grand Justice and Examination Committee members within the next two to three days, so that the President could nominate them as soon as possible. Lei Zhen has already been entrusted to send a letter to Youth Party members regarding this process.

### Jia Jingde Will Take the Position of Vice President of the Examination Yuan

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] The President originally intended to delay the appointment of Yu Jiaju of the Youth Party to the position of Vice President of the Examination Yuan. Now, because the Youth Party insists that it does not intend to consider submitting candidates to participate in the government until the seven conditions proposed by the party have been agreed to, it was decided on the 22nd that Jia Jingde, the former Minister of Personnel, would take the position. Shi Zhiquan will remain the Vice President of the Judicial Yuan. The nominations for the Presidents and Vice Presidents of the Examination and Judicial Yuan can be sent by the Presidential Office to the Control Yuan so that the Yuan can immediately convene a meeting to exercise its power of consent.

### Legislative Yuan Passes Resolution to Accept $400 Million in US Aid; Authorizes Government to Negotiate Bilateral Agreements

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] At the meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 22nd, after listening to Foreign Minister Wang Shijie's report on the US Aid to China Act and his answers to the questions raised by various committee members, the Legislative Yuan passed a resolution with 337 votes (out of 394 committee members present) to accept the total of $400 million in aid, authorizing the government to negotiate and sign formal bilateral agreements with the United States, and to properly use the US aid.

### Foreign Minister Wang Reports on the Negotiations for US Aid

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] The 14th meeting of the first session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 9:20 AM on the 22nd. After Chairman Sun Ke read out the report items and passed the minutes of the previous meeting, Foreign Minister Wang reported on matters related to US aid. He first reviewed the negotiations with the United States since last summer, briefly stating: Initially, it was intended to obtain a loan from the Washington Export-Import Bank, but this type of commercial loan that requires repayment was not suitable for providing our country with aid for large-scale planned construction, so there were no results. It was not until October 27 that a small-scale political Sino-US Relief Agreement was signed, under which the United States successively allocated $45 million in accordance with the Foreign Aid Act of 1947 to supply food rationing to our country's five major cities in the nature of relief. At that time, the US side had already indicated that, depending on the urgency of the world situation, there would be a large-scale aid to Europe plan. With the help of all parties, the aid to China plan was also drafted at the same time. After the two cases were submitted to the US Congress, the principle that aid to China must also aid Europe and that the two cases must be established simultaneously was decided. Therefore, on April 3 of this year, the US House and Senate passed an overall foreign aid bill. However, the bill only stipulated the maximum amount of aid funds. The exact amount still had to await the approval of the Congressional Appropriations Committee by both houses. Therefore, the amount has recently been reduced again through this procedure. Secondly, the Foreign Minister also explained that our country's purposes for negotiating aid with the United States are divided into four points: (1) The excess of cotton, oil, rice, and grain imports is caused by the current domestic economic situation, so foreign aid is needed to balance foreign exchange. (2) The maintenance and development of morning and industry requires foreign aid. (3) The supply of military materials requires foreign aid. (4) The reserve fund for currency system reform especially requires special privileges.

### Our Self-Help Plan Will Be Submitted After the Agreement is Signed

The first three of these four goals have received US support. However, regarding the fourth item, currency system reform, the United States believes that it is still difficult to discuss it within the first 12 months of aid. The amount of aid stipulated in the US Aid to China Act has now been determined to be a total of $400 million, to be used within one year from the date the bill was established on April 3 of this year. Among them, $125 million in special aid does not need to be repaid, and we can use it to purchase military supplies. The remaining $275 million in economic aid, except for $60 million in special construction loans, can also be expected to be provided as a gift. However, this $60 million was still decided when the total amount had not been reduced. Now that the total amount has been reduced by as much as $63 million, our country will negotiate with the United States to proportionately reduce this special construction loan. Regarding the use of this US aid, the Foreign Minister reiterated that the ten principles personally drawn up by former President Zhang of the Executive Yuan are still sufficient for use, and a self-help plan will be submitted after the Sino-US bilateral agreement is signed. He also explained that the $50 million that the United States first allocated after the passage of the bill has already been used in accordance with the exchange of letters between our Ambassador Gu and the US Secretary of State on April 30. Aid materials are already on the way. The use of all US aid funds must be subject to a bilateral agreement signed by the two countries before July 3, otherwise all aid to China affairs will be suspended. Therefore, it is urgently hoped that the Legislative Yuan can accept the aid to China case as soon as possible so that agreements can be concluded. As for the specific plans for using US aid, the various competent departments are actively formulating them, and US representatives are also cooperating in investigating resources that can be developed in various places, and will be listed separately in the budget and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review.

### Chen Yi Will Immediately Go to Hangzhou to Take Office; Visited Wang Yunwu Yesterday to Discuss Zhejiang Province's Finances; Shen Honglie Prepares to Hand Over and Go to Taiwan to Recuperate

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] The newly appointed Chairman of Zhejiang Province, Chen Yi, visited Finance Minister Wang Yunwu at 5:00 PM on the 22nd to discuss Zhejiang Province's financial problems.

Chen also visited Weng Wenhao, He Yingqin, Shao Lizi, and others on the 21st and 22nd, and will go to Zhejiang to take office in two or three days.

[Our Dispatch, Hangzhou, 22nd] Because Chairman Shen happened to be changing personnel before the end of the year, he specially telegraphed Chen Yi to come to Hangzhou to take office as soon as possible. All departments are ready to hand over. Shen hopes to be able to hand over on July 1st and then go to Taiwan for a short recuperation. Among the new government committee members, the People's Party and the Youth Party each occupy one person.

### 200 Tons of Military Supplies Purchased by Us from Belgium Transported to Guangdong via Hong Kong

[United Press, Hong Kong, 22nd] Today's newspaper reported that in addition to purchasing military supplies from the United States and Canada, China is also purchasing from European countries. Recently, 200 tons of small arms and bullets purchased from Belgium are being transported to the Guangdong Provincial Government via Hong Kong.

### The Latter US Aid Will Be Visible in Early Spring

At the end of his report, the Foreign Minister clearly indicated: The subsequent aid will be visible in early spring. He said: China should not completely rely on foreign countries, and should strive to implement self-help plans to cooperate with the full utilization of aid. The US foreign aid plan was originally scheduled for four years. Although Congress only passed a one-year measure, it is still continuous. If our country achieves remarkable results in using this aid during this one year, when the US Congress discusses this matter again next spring, we will naturally have better conditions to obtain more aid.

After Foreign Minister Wang finished his report, Xiao Zheng, Wu Tiecheng, and others believed that it was not necessary to submit it for review, and that the Yuan should discuss it directly. Chen Guyuan, Jiang Yiping, and others expressed their opposition, believing that this matter was of great importance, and that it was a report item and should be submitted for review according to the agenda. After a vote, with 392 people (out of 474 committee members present) in favor, it was passed to change the agenda and discuss it directly in the general assembly. The committee members then took turns speaking, expressing their opinions and raising questions on this case. The questions were mostly concentrated on the nature of the matters that China promised to include in the bilateral agreement stipulated in Section 405 of the US Aid to China Act, and the various issues of using the aid. Foreign Minister Wang answered them separately. After listening to the answers, the committee members responded with applause of trust and satisfaction. The US Aid to China Act was accepted by the highest legislative body of our country with the consent of an overwhelming majority of legislators. The morning meeting ended at 12:30 PM.

### Kuomintang Appoints Seven People to Study Our Foreign Policy

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] In order to study the issue of our country's foreign policy and the attitude of allied countries towards Japan, the Kuomintang broadly discussed it at the Central Political Council on the 21st. Many of the committee members who attended expressed their opinions. Finally, Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Weng Wenhao, Chen Bulei, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Li Weiguo, and others were appointed to conduct preliminary research for reference. As for the saying that the government will issue a statement on the US's support for Japan, it is still too early to tell.

### Stillman Investigation Team Willing to Assist in Repairing the Hunan-Guizhou Railway

[Our Dispatch, Changsha, 22nd] Stillman went to Hengyang from Xiangtan on the evening of the 21st and to Guangzhou on the 22nd. The team paid close attention to the rich mineral resources along the Hunan-Guizhou Railway and is willing to assist in repairing the Hunan-Guizhou Railway. American railway advisor Han Shiding is especially interested in this project. Han's opinion: The first step of this road should best be able to reach Xupu, or at least Xinhua. The required rails can be taken from all the light rails that are relocated after the Guangdong-Hankou Railway is changed, and the required sleepers can be sourced locally. The restoration of the Hunan-Guizhou Railway, which the people of Hunan have dreamed of for many years, has a chance to become a reality.

### Foreign Minister Wang Explains That the Bilateral Agreement Does Not Involve Our Country's Aviation Rights; Selling Materials Can Achieve the Effect of Reducing Issuance

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] When answering questions about the US Aid to China Act at the meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 22nd, Foreign Minister Wang emphasized that the bilateral agreement based on accepting US aid would absolutely not affect the integrity of our country's sovereignty. In addition to explaining that the "matters that China has promised" referred to in Section 405 of the Aid to China Act are mainly self-help matters that China has promised to undertake, the Foreign Minister also confirmed that the agreement would definitely not involve the aviation rights that our country should maintain itself. As for the proper interpretation of coastal and inland river navigation rights and the measures that our country takes proactively based on this interpretation, that is another matter. Foreign Minister Wang explained that this US aid is both political and economic. The fact that its plan is only for 12 months is a preliminary step for a fairly long-term plan. Regarding its operating agencies, in addition to passing through the original relevant ministries and commissions, the US Aid Utilization Committee will definitely not be large and will not cause any waste. For the economic aid part, the legal currency received from the sale of materials will all be deposited in the National Bank. Except for the planned use determined by both parties and the one-tenth originally stipulated in the bill to be allocated for rural restoration, it will not be used for other purposes. In this way, it can achieve the effect of reducing issuance and promoting budget balance. As for the validity of the bilateral agreement, it should depend on the needs of using this aid.

### The Legal Currency Reform of the Land Tax; The Case Was Voted Down After Debate in the Legislative Yuan; The Postal Rate Increase Case Was Referred to the Transportation Committee for Review

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 22nd] The Legislative Yuan continued its meeting in the afternoon of the 22nd, proceeding with the discussion items listed on the agenda and handling four motions: (1) Yu Ruzhou and others proposed that the government amend Articles 237 and 233 of the Criminal Law. The resolution was to vote it down. (2) Jiang Yiping and others proposed amending Article 30 of the Lawyers Law. The resolution was to refer it to the Legal System Committee for review. (3) Wang Zemin and others proposed that the government should seek the consent of public opinion organizations before increasing the prices of state-owned and publicly-owned professional services. The resolution was to refer it to the Transportation Committee and incorporate it into the Executive Yuan's proposal to increase postal rates for review. (4) Chen Zifeng and others proposed that the land tax be changed to legal currency, and that the collection of treasure and procurement should be abolished. After debate, the resolution was to vote it down. Chen Zifeng's proposal was read out by the reporter, and Chen himself recounted the reasons why the collection in kind was full of abuses and excessively disturbed the people. Deng Chengtao, Deng Shizeng, and Liu Pingsan first raised written objections, stating that the abuses of tax collection lay in the unsoundness of the agency and the lack of integrity of the personnel, and it did not matter whether it was collection in kind or collection in legal currency. Chen's case turned the cart before the horse. The system of land tax collection in kind and procurement was extremely effective in raising military food and civilian food during the Anti-Japanese War. Now that troops are being used for suppression, it should be used as a reference. How can we cut off the source of food and affect basic national policies? In addition, the value of the currency is unstable, and the price of food procurement is difficult to determine fairly. The interests of the government and the people are difficult to take into account fairly. If Chen's case is established, the consequences will be disastrous. Wu Shipeng, Yang Sicheng, and others also spoke against it, while Liu Xieping advocated purchasing public grain with grain price certificates after changing to collecting legal currency. Finally, it was put to a vote. Among the 310 committee members present, only 112 people voted in favor of submitting it for review. This proposal, which was enough to cause the issue of resale, was voted down.

Commentary

### Impressions of a Trip to Japan

— Wu Gao

Recently, I traveled to Tokyo to conduct an on-the-ground investigation into the general situation of Japan under Allied occupation. I interviewed General MacArthur and the responsible personnel of the Chinese and British delegations, and also had candid discussions with people from all walks of life in Japan. The impressions gained from this trip were quite profound.  In a nutshell, the economic collapse and communization of Japan are the gravest threats to peace in the entire Pacific.

I collected extensive information from various sources regarding Japan's economic and military situation, which made me believe that it would take at least twenty to fifty years for Japan to rebuild its economy and rearm itself enough to pose a real threat to China or the United States. According to MacArthur, he will never allow Japan to be revived and pose a military threat. Anyone who has been to Japan and examined the facts will understand this.  Currently, Japan's "military" consists of only 125,000 Japanese police officers, with an average of one old-fashioned pistol for every five police officers, and half of these are unusable. This is not because the Allied Headquarters lacks weapons, but because MacArthur distrusts the Japanese.  During my meeting with MacArthur, I learned from his tone that the painful experiences he had fighting the Japanese army in the Philippines were unforgettable. As for Japan's "Maritime Safety Agency," there has been much discussion in Chinese public opinion, saying that it could be the foundation for Japan's future navy; in reality, this is not entirely true. The so-called "Maritime Safety Agency" only has 38 small boats of seventy to eighty tons each, and none of them are armed. These small boats are only used for rescue and anti-smuggling purposes.

However, on the other hand, the power of the Japanese Communist Party is like the rising sun, constantly expanding. The reason for this is the economic situation in Japan.  Currently, the food shortage problem in Japan cannot be solved, and the general situation in the economic world is extremely chaotic, resulting in a decline in the general economic level, which only helps the development of the Japanese Communist Party.  If this situation is allowed to continue unchecked, I am afraid there will be alarming progress. According to the Japanese Communist Party, it has 50,000 to 60,000 party members, but according to foreign estimates, its external guard alone has at least one million people, especially in northern Japan, which is close to the Soviet Union. They are the famous "rice bowl" communists.  In the event that the Soviet Union decides to "island hop" and invade northern Japan, their "rice bowls" can still be guaranteed. However, most Japanese people are taciturn and know everything very well in their hearts. The people of China and the United States have suffered greatly in the war against Japan and will never forget the atrocities of the Japanese soldiers, so I believe that Japan will never have a chance to turn over under the control of the Allied Headquarters. However, in the eyes of the Japanese, there is also a hope at present, which is communism. They believe that the Soviet Union did not really fight Japan, so the Soviet people do not have the unforgettable unpleasant memories of the people of China and the United States in the minds of the Japanese.  What's more, the Soviet Union welcomes red Japan to join their camp! Although the Japanese Communist Party does not have an international background on the surface, the Japanese Communist Party and the Korean Communist Party are in contact, and the Korean Communist Party and the Chinese Communist Party in Northeast China are in contact. If Japan, North Korea, and Northeast China form a communist group, then the Soviet Union can also have an "Iron Curtain" in the Far East and do whatever it wants.  The Soviet Union will never miss this opportunity. Therefore, at present, if we Chinese do not broaden our horizons and see the truth of the world situation, and blindly oppose the anti-Japan policy currently being implemented by the United States, it is tantamount to approving the forced communization of Japan!

The Allied Headquarters does not take the danger of Japan's communization lightly. In fact, the economic policy of the Allied Headquarters is to prevent Japan from going bankrupt economically and not allowing the Communist Party to take advantage of the situation.  For example, land reform, increasing food imports, gradually restoring foreign trade, and increasing living standards are all being implemented in order. The Allied Headquarters believes that this is the only way to resist the communist threat to Japan.  However, the Communist International is able to deeply understand the purpose of the economic policy of the Allied Headquarters, so it is doing everything possible to engage in a large-scale propaganda movement in China, trying to create the illusion for the Chinese people, turning the anti-American and pro-Japanese movement of professional students and cultural peddlers into a genuine anti-American movement of the general public, so that there is a gap between the two major Allied countries of China and the United States, and then they can safely let go and communize Asia and the world.  But according to my observation, Japanese workers will never threaten the markets of China, the United States, and Britain in the next two or thirty years. My reasons are twofold: (1) Japan has already lost its pre-war supply of raw materials, so it cannot obtain cheap raw materials; (2) because the Allied Headquarters encourages labor unions and collective contracts, the low wages in Japan no longer exist, and even its wage level is far above that of China. For example, a set of silk kimono costs US$14 in Tokyo, but only US$5 in Shanghai. It is impossible for Japanese goods to be sold cheaply, so how can they compete with goods from other countries? General Shang Zhen of our delegation also agrees with me that Japan's economic recovery is not enough to pose a threat to China and the United States.

My impression of MacArthur is also very deep. I think he should be one of the top figures in the United States and can run for president of the United States. If he can often return to the country and have more contact with voters, he will definitely be elected. However, MacArthur always refuses the invitation of Congress on the grounds that his "duties are binding" and concentrates on managing defeated Japan so that it does not become a communist vassal.  MacArthur has many brilliant insights into the political situation in China and is not superficially knowledgeable. During my meeting with MacArthur, I touched on many domestic issues in China. MacArthur's position on China's problems has not changed since his letter to Representative Judd, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, on March 3 this year, advocating increased aid to China. Some people deliberately say that he underestimates China's important position in the Far East. As long as you have a detailed conversation with MacArthur, you will know that this is all nonsense.  Someone said that he has a unique view on China's problems. He believes that if the Chinese government cannot concentrate all its efforts on solving military problems, then other problems are out of the question. At the same time, he also believes that if the Chinese government cannot obtain the "full" assistance of the United States, then it will not be easy for the Chinese government to solve its military problems.  If the current Chinese government troops stick to the old ways and adopt a strategy of positional warfare, it will be difficult to eliminate the military pressure of the Chinese Communists. In the future, only by adopting a new type of mobile strategy can the Communist army be defeated. MacArthur has the most extensive understanding of the Pacific. After talking with him, one believes that MacArthur is not only the MacArthur of the Philippines, not only the MacArthur of Japan, but also the MacArthur of the Pacific against totalitarianism. He said that in the entire Pacific situation, China is the first bulwark against totalitarianism. He also knows deeply the psychology of the Chinese people's fear of the Japanese, and at the same time, he also has painful memories of the Japanese, which he will never forget. He will never allow Japanese militarism to be revived. In practical terms, he believes that even if World War III breaks out, the United States does not need Japan as its ally.

In short, today's Japan is completely under the control of the Allied Headquarters. The economic recovery of Japan is still out of the question; the re-emergence of militarism will only be possible in at least thirty or forty years. However, China, Britain, and the United States must be united and consistent, otherwise, if they are provoked and their steps deviate, it will lead to unfortunate consequences. Totalitarian propagandists have armed themselves with the issue of Japan in an attempt to divide the relationship between China and the United States. This is something we must be careful to prevent in order to avoid falling into this insidious trap!

### Red Actress Zhou Wenna Eloped with Lover – Elderly Father Killed in Attempt to Find Daughter – Strange Murder Case Occurs in Shenyang – Complicated Plot Revolves Around Wealth, Lust, and Both

[This Newspaper Shenyang 17th Dispatch] At around 4:00 a.m. this morning, a murder case occurred in the New World Theater in Panyang. The deceased was Zhou Xuwu (54 years old), the father of the local red actress Zhou Wenna, who died from two gunshots to the head. His mother, Zhou Wang (46 years old), suffered two gunshots to the leg and was seriously injured. At dawn on the 17th, three strange men suddenly broke into the Zhou residence, wearing black uniforms and top hats. They woke up Zhou Xuwu and his wife, initially claiming to be checking household registrations, but then demanded gold bars. Zhou Xuwu said: We are artists, living off our daughter, how could we have gold bars? Zhou's mother was willing to offer two gold rings, but the bandits refused, and immediately dragged Zhou's father to the corridor and shot him dead before fleeing. The case involves family, love and other issues, and is complicated. The inside story is recorded as follows: Zhou Xuwu from Penglai, Shandong, lived in Dalian and had a daughter, Zhou Wenna (19 years old). She learned acting from a young age, and as she grew up, she became beautiful and versatile, with a round and clear voice, and many fans were fascinated. She had a good reputation in Dalian. Last spring, she fled to Tianjin, but there were few admirers. Later, the whole family came to Shenyang and sang in the New World Theater, becoming extremely popular for a while. Last summer, she met Chen Shixi, a quartermaster colonel in the military, who was generous and wealthy. Over time, they fell in love and eloped. The father had a penchant for opium and regarded his daughter as a cash cow, so he often tried to dissuade her. Zhou was depressed and dejected. Just when Chen was caught embezzling, he escaped to Beiping with her on the 4th of this month. After the disappearance of the red actress, her parents learned the truth from her second daughter, Hongna. They regretted their decision and realized that they would have no source of income in the future. They decided to pack their bags and fly to Beiping on the 18th to find their daughter, but unexpectedly, they were killed on the 17th. The reporter visited Zhou's wife, Wang, and saw that she had four gemstone gold rings on her hands, which were sparkling, indicating that she was quite wealthy. She looked dazed and spoke weakly. She said that someone had recently told her that Wenna and Chen had reappeared on the street, but she had not seen them return home. She believed that her daughter was still in Beiping and suspected that the case was related to Chen. Although this murder case is very tortuous, the plot revolves around wealth and lust. The police have now obtained clues and it will not be difficult to solve the case in the next few days.

### Yang Mei Arrives at He Residence by Special Car – Begins Intense Examination Life

[This Newspaper Chongqing 22nd Dispatch] Yang Mei arrived in the city at 5:30 PM this afternoon, taking a special ambulance from Jiulongpo, accompanied by He Zongwen, She Shengyang and Mrs. She, Mrs. Che, and nurses and police. She was transferred by the Health Bureau to He Guoguang's mansion next to the Zhongzheng Hospital, and began an intense examination life that the world cares about. Yang Mei was wearing a floral patterned cheongsam and white shoes and socks. Upon arriving at the He residence, she did not feel tired climbing dozens of steps, and she even publicly stated the name of Dean Hu, whom she had parted with for 21 days. Yang Mei lives on the first floor of the He residence, with a total of two rooms, which have Yongmenting wooden floors, and another hygiene room. Starting at 12:00, the Zhongzheng Hospital sent people to decorate Yang Mei's room. After Yang Mei arrived, the original residents moved out and rearranged the room. Yang Mei lives with a nurse, who takes care of her in shifts day and night. There is a large lawn in front of the room, which Yang Mei is most satisfied with. Standing on the stone steps, one can overlook the city view. There is a side door that leads to Zhongtao. The key is kept by Nurse Chief Chuan Xizhen, and no outsiders are allowed to open the door without her permission. Also, Attorney Wang Xianjia went to meet Hu Xianwen at 2:30 PM and had a long conversation. The result was satisfactory. Hu emphasized that scientists love specimens more than themselves and will never kill the goose to get the eggs. Moreover, scientific procedures do not allow loopholes, so he attaches importance to Yang Mei's daily life, and everything will never be forced, because abnormal normal life can create unnatural and artificial results.

### Inside Story of Corruption Case in Changzhou Field Grain Office – Weng Cheng Not Clean – Lu Pinjin Flees

[This Newspaper News] During the tenure of former County Magistrate Weng, Lu Pinjin, the clerk and chief of the Third Section of the County Field Grain Office, who was personally appointed by Weng, committed corruption. After the report, the Provincial Office investigated and confirmed the truth. Chairman Wang telegraphed to order the county to detain him and hand him over to the court for strict handling. The Academy complied with Weng's request and released him on bail under the pretext of handling the handover. Unexpectedly, after being released on bail, he fled without a trace, just like Shou Xuefan (one of the key figures in the corruption), who was released by Weng's relative, Zhou. Recently, the Field Grain Office discovered that Tianfeng Rice Mill, a special rice mill, used more than 3,500 of the owed grain. The inside story is dark and is also related to Lu Pinjin. The summons was nowhere to be found, and public opinion translated. The court is now ordering the guarantor to hand over the person within three days. According to reports, Weng Cheng has served as county magistrate in Yongjia and Qingtian counties in Zhejiang Province. During his tenure, he was also known for corruption. The Zhejiang Provincial Council's investigation into the flying bomb case has not yet ended, and he has only been in office in this county for nine months, and he has not made any achievements in county administration and there are many drawbacks. Recently, it was discovered that Weng Cheng spent 60,000 to 70,000 shi of surplus grain beyond the top budget. Before leaving, he also asked the remaining rice mills for 300 million yuan, which made onlookers feel disgusted.

### Subei Front Lines: A Night at Hede Town

— Special Correspondent Ling Songshou

[Funing Report, This Newspaper, 19th] Due to transportation issues, this reporter missed the opportunity to witness the National Army's capture of Hede Town. However, upon arriving in Funing, I immediately mounted a horse and galloped with all my might towards the long-awaited Hede Town.

Hede Town is the so-called Yan'an of northern Jiangsu, at least in the eyes of the people of northern Jiangsu, a
mysterious place. From before the war until now, almost a dozen years have passed. Except for the two years when the enemy occupied it, it has always been under the control of the Communist bandits and served as their "command post" in the northern Jiangsu war zone.

Leaving Funing, small streams and rivers were everywhere. These rivers became natural obstacles in the coastal area. During this National Army campaign, a lot of time was spent on bridge building, which gave the bandits a chance to escape, preventing the achievement of ideal results. The area thirty miles outside Funing City was originally a very good reclamation area before the war, but after ten years of control by the Communist bandits, thousands of acres of fertile land have been turned back into wasteland, overgrown with weeds, stretching as far as the eye can see, causing unspeakable sorrow.

Hede Town is not large, and arriving at Hede shattered my previous expectations of it. On the south bank of the Sheyang River, there are one or two hundred households. The cross-shaped streets are sparsely lined with simple thatched huts... This is Hede. A small river quietly flows from its northwest corner to its east corner, dividing it into two parts.

Hede Town used to be a large town in the coastal area and had a Hede Salt Reclamation Company here. I saw the layout of the Hede Company in a video taken from the air, which was a very large and well-organized building. It is located in the southeast corner of Hede Town, about three Chinese miles from the town center. When I went to see it, the interior was in a chaotic mess. It is said that Chen Yi, Su Yu, Guan Wenwei, Chen Qingxian... all lived in these very ordinary tile houses for a long time. Apart from the Hede Company, there are not many tile houses in Hede Town. There is a Huazhong Bank in the southern section of North-South Street, a cooperative in the eastern section of East-West Street, and the Sheyang Public Hospital in the northeast corner of the town. These are the only tile houses in Hede Town, and they were built by the enemy.

Hede Town has been occupied by the Communist bandits for more than ten years, but not only did they not build anything here, but they also destroyed the machinery of the original small flour mills and yarn factories. All that remains is a repair shop and a clothing factory. Speaking of farmland, from military maps or aerial photographs, the area within dozens of miles around Hede Town is crisscrossed with fields, a neatly arranged reclamation area. However, at present, apart from a very small number of fields near Hede Town that are planted with crops, more than 90% of the fields are bare, facing the sky. From looking at the four suburbs, thinking of Yan'an in the distance, and looking at Hede up close, I was foolishly thinking about the situation if the Communist bandits seized power.

Unless you truly join the Communist bandits or act as a henchman for them, it is not easy to be an honest and obedient citizen in the bandit area. The land has been divided, but it is not given to you for free. Public grain and public grass must be borrowed in advance, local officials will extort you, and there will be ×× donations... It is probably impossible for one person to eat their fill from three acres of land. If you want to do business, they have strict control. You must register your goods in and out, and you must obtain a guarantee to leave the bandit area—guaranteeing that you will return. When the goods are brought back, you must sell them all to their commercial bank, and they will give you a meager profit. Of course, the things you bring back must be what they need. In fact, the most important goods are directly purchased by their cadres in Jiangnan and smuggled back by sea. The waterway from the Sheyang River estuary to Hede Town is only forty Chinese miles. This is the main reason for the importance of Hede Town.

When the National Army first entered Hede Town, there were only more than seven hundred women, children, and elderly people. Three days later, the population had doubled with the return of people from the surrounding villages. The people of Hede Town also see the Central Government and the National Army as a mystery. "Ten years, and we've only just seen the National Army." This was what an elder of seventy years old told me.

A night in Hede, returning to Funing.

### US Republican Party's New Policy Platform Submitted to National Convention for Vote; Advocates Strengthening Traditional Friendship with China

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 22nd (Broadcast): Philadelphia report, the Republican National Convention's presidential candidate nomination began at 9 PM on Wednesday. Dewey took the lead, Taft closely followed, and Stassen lagged behind. However, Stassen stated that he would persist to the end and was unwilling to accept the nomination as the vice-presidential candidate.

[Report from this newspaper] New York, 22nd (Broadcast): Philadelphia report, the Republican National Convention began its second session at 12:22 AM today, announcing the party's policy platform. The meeting time was 22 minutes later than originally scheduled.

[United Press, Philadelphia, 22nd] Republican policy drafters today disclosed the policy platform, advocating an internationalist foreign policy, and on the domestic front, advocating continued tax cuts, protection of human rights, and a decisive battle against communism. The policy platform, passed by a 104-member motion committee, will be submitted to the full convention on the 22nd for a formal vote. The policy platform, totaling 2,700 words, elaborates on the principles of the Republican Party, which hopes to use this to achieve its first presidential election victory in twenty years. The policy platform guarantees government economy, anti-inflation, a strong military, a long-term agricultural program, continuation of the Taft-Hartley Labor Act, with improvements when necessary, a comprehensive land reclamation plan, and expansion of the security system. At the same time, it severely criticizes the Truman administration for its improper handling of domestic and foreign affairs. The foreign affairs section advocates continued assistance to "peace-loving countries," limiting the abuse of veto power within the United Nations, organizing UN forces, and a policy of "welcoming cooperation against appeasement with goodwill and determination." The articles on foreign aid are as follows: "Within the limits of our economic well-being, we will cooperate on the basis of self-help and mutual assistance to aid other peace-loving countries to restore their economic independence, human rights, and basic freedoms. We will firmly demand that all foreign aid matters be implemented in a pragmatic and effective manner." The policy platform also guarantees support for the reciprocal trade system, but "always protects our country's agriculture and industry," and guarantees full recognition of the new Jewish state of Israel in accordance with the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter. It also stated: "We will advocate the historic friendship with China and express deep concern for its efforts to maintain sovereignty and freedom." The motion committee passed the Republican policy platform proposal, including one or two important additional clauses, one advocating recognition of Israel, and the other a strong anti-communist declaration without directly mentioning the Soviet Union. The introductory remarks at the beginning of the policy platform summarized the international goals, stating: "Our foreign policy aims to protect the free United States in a free world of free people. This requires the strengthening of the United Nations and the basic recognition of the United States' right to be interested in the freedom of other people."

[Reuters, Philadelphia, 22nd] As the Republican National Convention began debating foreign policy leaders on the 22nd, an unexpected debate will occur. Delegates arriving later are extremely resentful of the full internationalism in the draft foreign policy platform. Indiana Senator Harness, after arriving late yesterday, told reporters that he would work with other delegates to "remove some international teeth from the foreign policy platform." Harness is a member of the Resolutions Committee of the full convention.

### Illinois Governor Green Promotes Republican Policies; Vigorously Criticizes the Democratic New Deal

[United Press, Philadelphia, 21st] Illinois Governor Green delivered a policy speech at the Republican National Convention here on the evening of the 21st, saying that the Republican Party would launch a movement to become a "peace-seeking" party in terms of foreign policy. In terms of domestic policy, it will oppose the New Deal's "establishment" and "bureaucracy" and adopt a "free enterprise" policy. Green called on the delegates to elect "new leaders for a greater America" and made a confident prediction that the Republican Party would win the presidential election and continue to control Congress in the general election in November.

Green also stated that the New Deal cannot win with Truman. Even if Truman is not nominated to run for president, no matter who the Democratic National Convention nominates as the presidential candidate, they will follow the old policy of the New Deal, which the American people no longer believe in. Green also warned the most conservative members of the Republican Party: "We will no longer return to any old ways of the past. Everything in the past tells us that we have a task for the future." Green repeatedly criticized the government's "inefficiency" and "unproductive waste" over the past sixteen years, and strongly criticized the Democratic Party's foreign policy actions. He denounced the fact that the US government repeatedly promised peace even when it knew that war was inevitable. "The only promise the government kept was the promise the government made to Stalin. Because of this promise, the victory of World War II has been rendered nominal by appeasing the Soviet Union. The world war we are facing today is the product of the combination of the New Deal and communism. The New Deal cannot escape this crime by using bipartisan foreign policy as an excuse, because the Republican Party did not participate in the Tehran, Yalta, or Potsdam conferences." Green guaranteed that the Republican Party would adopt a "very firm" policy to ensure peace and restore the world's trust and respect for American diplomacy. He also stated that the core of the Republican foreign policy lies in using wisdom and determination and expanding American democracy to contain the spread of world slavery. "We are not inciting stock disputes. On the contrary, we will pursue every peaceful method. We will make this conference a true alliance for peace."

### Mrs. Roosevelt's Tone Consistent with Green's

[United Press, Philadelphia, 21st] Mrs. Roosevelt, former US Congresswoman and wife of the publisher of Time and Life magazines, stated in a speech at the Republican National Convention on the evening of the 21st that millions of people have been plunged into death and slavery due to the secret transactions of Roosevelt and Truman with the Soviet Union. These people are the Poles whom we want to give freedom to and the brave people in Eastern and Central Europe who worked underground for us, all of whom have been convicted for the sins of Yalta and Potsdam.

### Boundary Dispute Resolved; Soviet-Finnish Agreement Signed

[Reuters, Moscow, 21st] TASS reports: The Soviet and Finnish governments signed an agreement in Moscow today to resolve the boundary dispute between the two countries. The talks began on the 1st of this month and proceeded throughout in an atmosphere of friendship and understanding.

### US Republican National Convention Venue Decorated with Splendor; Convention Activities Broadcast via Television

[Central News Agency, Philadelphia, 22nd] In terms of material arrangements and public facilities, the 1948 Republican National Convention will be the largest gathering of its kind. The tall and majestic convention venue is located next to the University of Pennsylvania. When it was built, it cost more than $5 million. In order to cope with this year's national conventions of various political parties, Philadelphia has spent more than $500,000 to specially repair it. The venue can accommodate more than 13,000 people, who can personally listen to the proceedings of this historic gathering. But this year, it is estimated that more than 20 million people can witness the various activities of the convention through television transceivers.

This is the first time in history that the venue has been equipped with 50,000 kilowatts of lighting for photography and transmission. The heat released by the lighting is equivalent to that under the scorching sun, so those who give speeches at the convention will be sweating profusely. To resist this sultry heat, the venue has been equipped with cold water equipment, and there are two cranes specially used to lift tons of ice. Many new radio booths with glass barriers have also been set up in the venue for broadcasting to major national telecommunications networks. Special microphones are installed everywhere in the broadcast positions, so that even the lowest sound in any corner of this vast venue can be amplified. The thoroughness of the telecommunications equipment can be seen in the following example. A radio station in Los Angeles has rented a private telephone line that is 3,000 miles long, renting it for 18 hours a day, so that as soon as the broadcast of the dramatic developments of the convention is released, the radio station can listen to it and rebroadcast it. The preparation of news reporters should also be mentioned here. The news reporters' seats are located on both sides of the convention rostrum, which is hung with portraits of famous Republican presidents of the past, with a total of more than 800 seats. The basement of the convention venue is full of work areas, where news agencies from all over the world have set up offices. The Central News Agency has an office unit here. In addition, hundreds of special telephones have been installed in the venue. A telecommunications company has specially installed equipment here that can send 5,000 words per minute. It is estimated that the news reporters will send a total of 300,000 words of telegrams for this convention. All of this grand occasion is worthy of being called "unprecedented."

### Soviet, American, British, and French Experts Meet to Discuss Berlin Currency Reform Issues; Will Also Discuss Trade Relations in the Four Occupation Zones

[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] The negotiations on currency reform in Berlin's four-power zone are scheduled to be held at 1:00 PM on the 22nd in the Berlin Allied Control Council. Soviet Commander-in-Chief Sokolovsky accepted the final proposal of the British, American, and French demands to hold this meeting on the night of the 21st, agreeing that four-power experts would discuss the issue of currency reform in Berlin.

The Soviet financial experts attending the meeting include Soviet Military Government Chief Financial Advisor Maritin, and Berlin Soviet Commander Colonel Mishin, etc. The French representatives are Leroy, Penier, Humbert, etc. The American representatives are Bennett and Wilkinson, and the heads of the British, American, and French military governments.

### East Germany Changes Currency System; Plan Awaiting Implementation

According to Rau, Chairman of the East German Economic Commission, Sokolovsky will approve the currency reform plan at any time. After implementation, the greatest protection will be given to workers, small-capital merchants, and intellectuals, while the greatest blows will be given to black market merchants and those suspected of war crimes. Wages and pensions will still be paid in the same amount in the new currency. Small savings that were frozen after the Soviet army occupied Germany in 1945 will be unfrozen. In addition, state-owned enterprises, democratic parties, trade unions, and municipal authorities can obtain preferential treatment for their funds.

[Reuters, Berlin, 21st] The latest report here confirms that the first step of the East German currency reform will be to stamp the old mark notes to distinguish them from the old marks that have lost their value in West Germany. At the same time, Berlin banks announced that they will no longer accept deposits from today. For days, long queues have formed outside the banks, waiting to open new accounts in the banks. They believe that after the currency reform is implemented, savings depositors can expect to receive more preferential treatment.

### US Military Train Refuses Soviet Inspection; Air Transport Resumes

[Reuters, Berlin, 21st] US Commander-in-Chief Clay declared that the number of US freight trains traveling from the west to Berlin will be temporarily suspended due to the Soviet insistence on implementing strict inspections, and air transport will be resumed. Clay stressed that the Soviet inspection of US military trains is a violation of the 1945 four-power agreement, and the US will never agree.

[United Nations, Berlin, 21st] The 10,000 US troops and civilians here all rely on air transport for supplies. The average number of planes flying back and forth every day is now 20, which will increase to about 70 from tomorrow. The British army has increased six planes.

### Explosion at US Dynamite Factory

### European Communist International Meeting; Reviewing Future Strategies; Meeting Location Temporarily Kept Secret

[Report from this newspaper] London, 22nd (Broadcast): Rome report, two people from the Communist Party here revealed that the Communist International is currently meeting in "somewhere in Czechoslovakia" to discuss strategies. As for where exactly, it is said that it cannot be revealed at present due to security reasons. One of them said that the Italian representatives attending the meeting can return to the country within this week and said that the situation will be announced as soon as the meeting ends. It was previously reported that this meeting was held in Rome, and then it was reported that it was held in Poland, but both of the above countries have denied it.

[United Press, London, 21st] It is reported that the Third International is meeting in a certain place in Poland.

### Large Number of Communists Infiltrate and Engage in Activities; Situation in Southern Thailand Suddenly Tightens; Malaya Continues to Search for Terrorists

[Reuters, Bangkok, 22nd] Officials announced: A large number of Malayan communists have infiltrated southern Thailand. The authorities have dispatched police reinforcements to the southern border area to strengthen defenses. Authoritative sources told this agency that the situation in southern Thailand has suddenly tightened due to the infiltration of Malayan communist elements. However, the Thai government still believes that it will not be difficult to suppress the illegal elements. After many top communist leaders were recently captured in Bangkok and the capitals of various provinces, the communist conspiracy to riot has been dealt a blow and will not play out like the recent situation in Malaya. The recent tightening of the situation in the south is probably due to the government's revocation of the state of emergency recently declared there.

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 21st] Police began searching for communist terrorists throughout Malaya this morning. It is reported that 113 people were arrested in Selangor, 30 were captured in Negeri Sembilan, 60 were captured in Perak (including 10 women), and more than 50 were arrested in Johor. However, many communist suspects and terrorists escaped justice. This morning, the police simultaneously searched the various branches of the Communist Party, the New Democratic Youth League, and a number of union meeting places throughout Malaya. However, most of the above locations were already empty, and all documents had been removed.

### US Consuls in Southeast Asia Meet in Bangkok

[Reuters, Bangkok, 22nd] US consular officials from seven countries in the Southeast Asia region—China, India, Burma, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaya—began a three-day meeting here on the 22nd, chaired by US Ambassador to Thailand Stanton.

It was also revealed by US Embassy officials here that Stanton will return to Washington on the 30th and will only return after about three months.

### Mountbatten to be Appointed as British Ambassador to the Soviet Union

[Reuters, London, 22nd] After returning to London from New Delhi yesterday, outgoing Indian Governor-General Mountbatten immediately answered Prime Minister Attlee's summons and went to 10 Downing Street for a meeting.

### Dispatching Japanese People Abroad to Participate in International Conferences

Far Eastern Commission Approves US Proposal

[Central News Agency, Washington, 21st (United Press)] The Far Eastern Commission announced that it has approved the US proposal to allow the Allied General Headquarters stationed in Japan to send Japanese people abroad to participate in international conferences. The Far Eastern Commission's action is actually only ratifying the steps that MacArthur has already taken based on his temporary authority. The Commission authorized MacArthur to send Allied General Headquarters observers to international conferences when he deems it necessary (if acceptable to the host country of the conference). Japanese technical experts may also accompany them.

### Dewey and Taft's Strength Will Soon be Revealed

Vandenberg's Hopes of Winning Decrease

[Reuters, Philadelphia, 21st] The candidates for the Republican presidential nomination have begun to prepare to fight for an advantage. Observers believe that Vandenberg's hopes of winning have decreased in the past 24 hours. This is probably because Vandenberg has not yet clearly stated whether he is willing to be nominated as a presidential candidate. His arrival here from Washington only on the 21st, and the sudden launch of a blitz offensive by Dewey's supporters. Dewey's supporters held talks with delegates to the full convention yesterday and held a press conference, launching moving propaganda in hotels. The first test of strength in the convention venue will be seen in the vote of the Credentials Committee of the full convention on Tuesday, because the delegation from Georgia has staged a double-package case, both claiming to represent the Republican Party of the state. One supports the nomination of Dewey, and the other supports the nomination of Taft. The vote of the Credentials Committee determines which is the legitimate delegation, which is tantamount to testing the strength of Dewey and Taft. It is said that Stassen's supporters also intend to support the Taft faction in the vote of the Credentials Committee in order to obstruct the Dewey faction, which is too prominent. The second strength test will be seen in the debate on foreign policy on Tuesday or Wednesday. The isolationists led by House Speaker Martin will do their best to revise the Republican foreign policy platform passed by the subcommittee.

[Central News Agency, Philadelphia, 21st] After the Republican National Convention opened, there were various forms of activities outside the convention. Dewey, Stassen, and Taft all set up campaign headquarters in Philadelphia hotels. The three of them were busy contacting and running around, and they were very nervous. MacArthur's campaign headquarters is located in a hotel. The building is smaller and the momentum is weaker. The competition will be initially determined in the next three days.

### Sixth Session, Second Day: Senators Questioned, Blaming City Government's Rice Distribution Price for Leading Commodity Price Increases

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Municipal Senate's first sixth session held its second meeting yesterday afternoon, starting at 3:00 PM. A total of 168 people attended, including the Speaker, Deputy Speaker, and Senators. Mayor Wu and heads of various bureaus and departments of the Municipal Government were also present. Over the course of four hours, Senators questioned and received responses from the Mayor, as well as the Directors of the Finance, Education, Public Utilities, and Public Works Bureaus. The atmosphere was generally calm and rational. The meeting adjourned at 7:10 PM.

The third meeting will be held this afternoon, with the agenda focusing on questions and answers directed at the Police, Social Affairs, Land Administration, Civil Affairs, and Health Bureaus. As of yesterday, 105 proposals had been submitted by Senators to the assembly. The deadline for collecting proposals for the session has been extended to this afternoon.

The questioning regarding the Mayor's policy report began yesterday afternoon. The Senators who raised questions included Mei Hao, Zhang Zhongyuan, Pang Jingzhou, Tong Xiang, Wang Weiyin, Jiang Haoran, Yu Chuanding, Zhao Yangxiong, Qu Yue, Fan Xipin, He Chengfu, and Tao Guangchuan. The key questions are summarized as follows:

(1) It has been found that many government agencies in the city frequently refuse to pay various public utility fees, such as electricity bills. Non-payment by government agencies accounts for 5-10% of the electricity company's total revenue. Furthermore, military personnel riding without tickets account for 30-40% of the total number of passengers. How will this be addressed? How can public utilities be allowed to raise prices three times in a row since February? How can ordinary citizens afford it? (2) The city government's rice distribution price is leading to increases in black market rice prices and overall commodity prices. It would be better for the city government to distribute rice rather than sell it directly, so that citizens can directly benefit. Furthermore, the limits on rice purchases are not being enforced, so they should be abolished. (3) What is the progress of the special relief donation drive? The six-month deadline is approaching, and apportioning donations to various trade associations is not an effective method. The focus should still be on soliciting donations from wealthy families. (4) Can the Mayor seek US aid from the central government, and can the Mayor announce a plan for utilizing US aid? Can the Senate appoint representatives to inquire about US aid matters? (5) For all future municipal affairs, whether political or economic, preventive measures should be taken beforehand, so that the darkness before dawn can be easily overcome. (6) Why did the Municipal Bank and the Industrial Trust Company not show any profits in the 36th year's financial statements? (7) The education budget accounts for 20% of total expenditures, but the actual expenditure was 14%. If it is claimed that education is constrained by funding, why is the full amount not being used? (8) There are rumors that the Municipal Government Personnel Office will be under the jurisdiction of the central government. If the Municipal Government believes that the organization is unsuitable, it should work with other municipal governments to advocate for what is right with the central government. (9) When dealing with student unrest, can guidance be prioritized as the first step? (10) Are there any new policies to stabilize society and control commodity prices in the future? (11) How will outstanding civil servants be cultivated and rewarded?

### Mayor Responds to Questions: Rice Prices Have Not Led Commodity Prices; Special Donation Drive Faces Significant Difficulties

After the questioning, the Mayor took the stage to respond, stating: The Municipal Government is constantly working to resolve the issue of government agencies and personnel refusing to pay utility fees. The Municipal Government agencies' arrears for electricity bills are not large and will be paid off soon. The Municipal Government has telegraphed the relevant agencies under the Central Government in Shanghai to discuss solutions. The Ministry of National Defense has sent personnel to Shanghai to facilitate payment. As for military personnel riding without tickets, it has been decided to reinstate the military and police inspectorate to investigate and crack down on this issue at various stations. According to general commodity price statistics, the rise in rice prices is less than that of other commodities, proving that rice prices have not led commodity prices. The reason why rice prices remain high despite both direct sales and distribution is that Shanghai is not a production area. When production areas increase prices, Shanghai cannot maintain lower prices on its own. The principle of rice distribution requires a sufficient supply of rice. Direct sales are used to regulate the market, and people are often sent to investigate whether sales are in accordance with price limits after the rice is sold. Therefore, price limits must still exist. Regarding the gasoline issue, the Municipal Government will hold a meeting with the Central Bank and other parties tomorrow (the 23rd) to discuss solutions. The special relief donation drive faces numerous difficulties. (1) It is difficult to investigate individuals. (2) It is also difficult to investigate the assets of wealthy families. However, if free donations cannot be implemented, the Municipal Government will devise other appropriate methods. The central government decides how to use US aid, and we can only request instructions from the central government. The reason for underutilization of education funds is the need to "rob Peter to pay Paul." For example, the road maintenance fees for the Public Works Bureau and the garbage truck repair fees for the Health Bureau have exceeded their budgets and must be immediately supplemented. Otherwise, broken roads and garbage everywhere will immediately affect citizens. "Stabilizing society and controlling commodity prices" was never a slogan of mine. Although it has not been achieved yet, I have always wanted to achieve it. However, commodity prices are related to currency, and the currency rate is a national issue. Therefore, local governments can only assist the central government in controlling commodity prices. Today's student unrest, using anti-Americanism and support for Japan as slogans, is no longer a question of patriotism, but a question of whether the attitude is open and aboveboard. I am confident that my attitude towards the Jiaotong University incident has always been impartial. Therefore, I have decided to bring this matter to the Senate and the five million citizens of Shanghai so that they can distinguish right from wrong, and avoid a situation in which everyone uses good pretexts to pursue their own selfish goals.

### Bribed Tax Officials: Rewards for Reporting

After the Mayor finished his response, it was almost 5:00 PM. After a ten-minute break, the questioning and responses from each bureau began. First up was the Finance Bureau. Only Tao Guangchuan raised two points: how to reward those who report tax officials taking bribes, and how to prevent bribery. Director Tian responded: I have very strict requirements for my subordinates and often urge them to respect their integrity. If any wrongdoing is discovered, it will be sent to the court for investigation. Rewarding junior staff to prevent bribery is still a fundamental solution. Whenever there is a vacancy at any level in this bureau, it will be filled by promoting existing staff, and no new people will be added, as an incentive.

### School Principal's Corruption: Education Bureau is Thoroughly Investigating

The senators questioning the Education Bureau included Zhang Zhongyuan, Fan Xipin, and Qu Yue. Director Li responded to each question as follows: (1) Regarding the construction of the art museum, the donation of 15 mu of land from Hardoon Garden has been decided, and construction can begin as soon as the charitable fund is allocated. (2) Principals are required to have guarantees from officials because recently one or two municipal principals left their positions for various reasons and disappeared. Therefore, the old practice is being revisited. The suggestion of mutual guarantees by principals is worth considering. (3) The construction materials for the Xinlu Normal School at the Yangjing site are ready, and construction can begin as soon as the Municipal Government allocates the construction funds. (4) Whether Dong Chengjian, the principal of the Municipal Normal School, is corrupt is being thoroughly investigated by the Municipal Education Bureau. (5) The establishment of a national school in the Laozha district is being negotiated, and it will definitely be established after the summer vacation.

### Roads Cannot be Fully Repaired Due to Limited Funding

Those who questioned the Public Works Bureau included Yu Ting and Shi Jiadong. Director Zhao replied, stating: (1) Roads in the North Station area cannot be fully repaired due to limited funding. However, construction on Zhejiang North Road has recently begun, and repairs will be carried out on Shanxi North Road, Tanggu Road, and Henan North Road. Construction of Station South Road is pending approval from the Executive Yuan because the road alignment belongs to the Railway Bureau. (2) Factory construction licenses in the city are still based on the factory exclusion zone regulations established by the Municipal Government in the 23rd year of the Republic. (3) If there are difficulties or delays in applying for construction licenses, please report them as much as possible. (4) Construction of the Zhaohe Memorial Tower has been delayed due to funding issues.

### Proposal to Request the Control Yuan to Thoroughly Investigate and Announce the Truth About the Central Bank's Use of Foreign Exchange

The Municipal Senate has continued to receive proposals in the past few days, including: (1) A proposal submitted by Fu Rulin, Yu Shun, Wang Yansong, Chen Gongda, Zhang Zhihan, Ji Yuanpu, and 40 others, requesting the Control Yuan to thoroughly investigate and announce the truth about the Central Bank's use of foreign exchange and the status of import and export management in the past two years, so as to learn from it and seek improvement. (2) A proposal by Wang Liben and Chen Ruhui, asking whether the conference can present a serious protest to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the name of the conference against the Siamese government's deliberate destruction of overseas Chinese education and illegal suppression of overseas Chinese schools, requesting a decision. (3) Yan Fa Sheng proposed that the association send a telegram to the Political Council ordering the China Trust Bureau to stop tendering Japanese wool fabrics. (4) Chen Peide and others proposed that the transfer of land property rights in this city should be reformed so that personnel in charge of field affairs are the legal advisers. (5) Zhang Zhusan and others proposed that the Municipal Government should lead both labor and management to jointly build new labor villages. (6) Fan Cai Kui and others proposed that the Municipal Government should allocate special funds to carry out labor education. (7) Jia Dechao proposed that the entire road and bridges of Pudong Avenue should be quickly repaired to ensure safety and facilitate transportation. (8) Cao Jun and others proposed that the Municipal Government should immediately approve the allocation of 30 mu of public land in the Jiangwan district as the site for the Municipal Jiangwan Middle School. (9) Jiang Menglin and others proposed that since the construction site funds for the city's three museums (library, museum, and art museum) have been resolved, the Municipal Government should quickly establish a construction committee to determine the permanent scale. (10) Jiang Menglin and others proposed that the roads in the current Nanshi area be repaired. (11) Ou Jinzao and others proposed that the City Ferry should allocate a portion of its profits as public welfare funds for local construction. (12) Wang Ziyang and others proposed that the Jiazha Canal, which has already been resolved to be filled in, has not yet been completed, so a deadline should be set for completion to facilitate transportation.

### Mayor Wu Hosts Banquet for Xinjiang Delegation

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Xinjiang Delegation, which had passed through Shanghai from Tianjin the day before, is scheduled to leave for Beijing today to bid farewell to the central government leaders. Mayor Wu and Secretary-General Shen hosted a banquet yesterday afternoon at the Municipal Bank Building for Zasak Qunwang Dawa, National Representative Tu Leqian, and more than 30 other people. The gathering ended happily around 2:00 PM.

### New Director of the China Trust Bureau, Cheng Yuanfan, to Take Office in Two Days

The Board of Directors of the Central Trust Bureau has appointed Cheng Yuanfan as the Director of the Bureau and urged him to take office immediately. Note: Mr. Cheng is scheduled to report to the Bureau on the 25th of this month.

### Confiscated Nylon Stockings Will Not Be Auctioned Domestically

[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to eliminate the source of nylon stockings, the Municipal Government has sent a letter to the Customs Office, requesting that confiscated nylon stockings no longer be auctioned domestically. As for all smuggled and dumped nylon stockings on the market, a plan has been agreed upon to ban sales completely after August 1st.

### Five Petitions: Hotel Industry Asks for Removal of Controls; Newspaper Employee's Residence Occupied

Yesterday, at the second meeting of the sixth session of the Senate, there were five petitions: (1) The Hotel Industry Association, protesting that the industry is uniquely subject to price controls, requested that the authorities revoke the controls to maintain their livelihoods. (2) The Gold and Silver Industry Association requested that the price of buying and selling jewelry be calculated according to the foreign exchange settlement certificate. (3) Refugees and unemployed workers from Northern Jiangsu requested the issuance of rickshaw licenses. (4) Citizen Jin Xiang, who was injured in the leg by a Health Bureau vehicle, requested that the Bureau provide compensation. (5) Sun Yuan, an employee of Shen Bao, whose residence at No. 324 Fumin Road in Nanshi was forcibly occupied on the 6th of this month by Xu Lunfang, who claimed to be serving in the Special Higher Group of the Military Police Department, leading a crowd. As of 3:00 PM yesterday, more than ten people had intruded again. Sun, feeling unjustly wronged, petitioned the Senate.

### Snippets from Questioning: Commodity Price Policy is Like Performing "Catching and Releasing Cao Cao"; Mayor is "Shoulderless" on Security Issues

For the past two days, the first Senator to sign in has consistently been Gao Shu'an.

On the opening day, someone suggested moving the afternoon meeting time from 3:00 PM to 2:30 PM, but the original 3:00 PM was maintained. The Speaker specifically emphasized "exactly" 3:00 PM, asking everyone to arrive "on time," and everyone applauded in agreement. However, there were still many people who arrived late yesterday.

Senator Jiang Haoran, who questioned the Mayor, delivered his questioning entirely as a performance, with intonation and cadence, and clear paragraphs, which was quite exemplary.

Senator Zhao Yangxiong, when talking about various unsatisfactory phenomena in education, said that this may be because Mayor Wu is not very interested in education.

Senator Fan Xipin, speaking with a Sichuan accent, said that Mayor Wu is "smooth" in his dealings, accommodating everyone, which was met with knowing smiles.

Senator He Chengfu, who raised questions yesterday, was the most impassioned and questioned for the longest time, not stepping down until the bell rang four times.

Senator He said: The Municipal Government is performing "Catching and Releasing Cao Cao" every day on policies such as commodity prices. Will there be any new policies in the future? He said: There are many security problems in Shanghai, such as the dance hall case, because the Mayor "lacks shoulders" (lacks responsibility).

He also said: Mayor Wu once proposed the slogan "Stabilize society and control commodity prices," but in the two years since the Mayor took office, society has become more unstable and commodity prices have become more unstable, increasing day by day. The Mayor replied awkwardly in his response: "I have never proposed such a slogan."

Mayor Wu said in response to someone pointing out that he is "smooth": "I have never been affiliated with any faction, so I don't want any faction when handling affairs. This may be the origin of the word "smooth"."

Among the questioning of various bureaus, the Finance Bureau was the most calm and peaceful. Director Tian took the stage and lightly addressed the issues before stepping down elegantly.

The focus of the fire was concentrated on the Public Utilities Bureau. When Director Zhao finished his response and was about to step down, he was "detained" by the Senators who stood up to question him, preventing him from stepping down. This happened repeatedly, as many as six times.

Senator Xu Zexiang, when questioning, said that the Nanshi area often experiences power outages, and said with emotion: "The citizens of Nanshi bear the same tax obligations, but the rights they enjoy are discriminated against. What is the reason?" This won a round of applause.

Yesterday's questioning was generally calm and peaceful, which can be said to be rare.

### Customs Employees Make Three Demands: Li Du Ding to Reply Today

Approval to Borrow One Month's Salary with Installment Deductions

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Jianghai Customs strike has lasted for four days as of yesterday. Although some important businesses are still being handled as usual, imported ships cannot unload goods, which has a significant impact. It is reported that the Inspector General of Customs, Li Du, the Customs Commissioner, Zhang Yongnian, and the Director of the Customs Administration, Zhang Fuyun, who went to Beijing to seek instructions, have returned to Shanghai with the results and will convene all customs employees today to respond to their three demands: (1) Approval to borrow one month's salary, but must be deducted in installments. (2) Regarding the request to increase treatment equal to the Four Banks and Two Bureaus, the Customs itself has no right to decide and must wait for the Ministry of Finance to submit it to the Executive Yuan for discussion and determination before replying. (3) The Customs already has a training association, and the employee welfare association will be revoked or merged. If all employees can accept persuasion, work may resume today.

### Employee Reaction

After customs employees learned that the Ministry of Finance had agreed to borrow one month's salary, they issued a written statement yesterday, stating: According to the current income of employees, the salary of junior employees is less than 200,000 yuan. A one-month loan is only worth one stone of white rice, and it is clear that it cannot alleviate the difficulties of employees, and it is unacceptable to our employees. As shown by past experience, borrowing money is not enough to solve the problem if the treatment problem is not completely improved. Therefore, in order to strive for a thorough improvement in treatment, we insist on our three demands. We will not resume work until the Customs authorities recognize the welfare association, improve treatment, and obtain definite guarantees.

### Suspicion of Gold and Foreign Currency in Tobacco Shop: Manager and Customers Detained and Interrogated

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Xiechang Tobacco Shop at No. 613 Sichuan Road was reported to be suspected of trading in black market gold and foreign currency. Yesterday, the Police Bureau's Economic Police Brigade sent personnel to search the shop. A five hundred million yuan check and five yuan each of US dollars and Hong Kong dollars were found on a visitor named Shi Zehui. Six US dollars and eight pieces of gold jewelry were found on another visitor named Yin Shuying. The suspects, along with the evidence and the shop manager, Liu Runming, were taken to the bureau for interrogation.

### Various Fees Collected by Jianghai Customs to be Doubled According to Current Amounts

The Jianghai Customs has recently been ordered to double the collection of various fees (including local miscellaneous fees) from the 22nd onwards, in accordance with current amounts.

### Shanghai-Hong Kong Wireless Telephone to be Tested This Morning

[Our Newspaper's Report] Following the Sino-US and Sino-British wireless telephone calls, the Ministry of Transport's International Radio Station and Telecommunications Bureau are actively preparing for the Shanghai-Hong Kong line wireless telephone. It is learned that all machines have been installed, and the first test call will be made with Hong Kong this morning. If there are no unexpected obstacles, official calls can be made in mid-July. In the future, telephone calls between the United States and Hong Kong will also be switched through this city, so the opening hours must be coordinated with the Hong Kong-US line. The billing will be agreed with the Hong Kong government, and users in this city will pay in legal currency converted from Hong Kong dollars.

### Health Bureau Sends Personnel to Examine Zhang Dailin: To be Moved to the Municipal Hospital for Examination

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai health authorities are very interested in the mystery of the "Shanghai Yang Sister" who does not eat. Yesterday morning, the director of the Municipal Second Hospital, Zeng Yaozhong, the section chief of the Health Bureau, Zhu Yunda, the pharmacist Ding Daoyu, and the director of the health section, Li, accompanied by the physician Li Lin, went to the female physician Hua Shujun's clinic to examine her. Zhang Dailin still insisted that she had not eaten for nine years. Director Zeng asked a few questions and thought that it was too early to start research work now. The first step should be to determine whether Zhang is definitely not eating. To complete this step, she must be more closely monitored. Therefore, he suggested that Zhang be moved to the Municipal Second Hospital for a two-week examination to determine the truth of her not eating. Physicians Li and Hua and the section chief of the Health Bureau, Zhu, all agreed. After reporting to the Health Bureau, Zhang will be moved to the Municipal Second Hospital today if she has no objection.

Former Dance Girl Rescued from Throwing Herself into the River

The truth about Zhang's life has gradually been revealed yesterday. Zhang is also known as Feng Aiqin and used to be a dance girl in the Shanghai dance hall. She met a Mr. Xu who served in a bank and cohabited with him. Later, she left home for some reason two months ago. One night, she tried to commit suicide by throwing herself into the river and was rescued by Zhang Tianyi. Therefore, Zhang Tianyi is not her husband. It was only because the news of her not eating spread that he decided to pretend. The Health Bureau and the medical community do not pay much attention to Zhang's actual background, because her life is one thing, and whether she does not eat is another. Therefore, they will continue to explore the mystery of not being greedy.

### Post Office Holds Symposium on Postal Rates

The Shanghai Postal Administration, considering that the current price index has risen more than 1 million times, while postal rates have only risen 100,000 times compared to the pre-war period, resulting in increasing postal losses, and in order to solicit opinions from all walks of life on the issue of postal rates, the Public Service Department of the Administration held a postal issue symposium, with postal rates as the theme. More than a dozen editors of various newspapers and economics experts attended. First, Director Li of the Administration announced the purpose of the symposium, followed by Secretary Xue Pinwen reporting on the postal revenue and expenditure and the reasons for postal losses. He said that the post office has made its best efforts in cutting expenditures and promoting business. At the same time, government subsidies are also limited, so the issue of price increases cannot but be considered. The editors of various newspapers and economics experts then expressed their opinions one after another, unanimously sympathizing with the postal fee increase, but hoping that the amount of increase for various types of mail should be differentiated. For example, printed matter, newspapers, and regular letters should be increased less, while express letters and registered letters may be increased more. If there are still losses after the increase in postal rates, the government can subsidize them.

### High Tide of Interpellations Concentrated on the Public Utilities Bureau Reason for Suspension of Route 7 Bus Service Due to Increasing Number of Fare Evaders

Yesterday, the interpellations of various bureaus reached a climax at the Public Utilities Bureau. Interpellations came one after another, including those from Xu Ze, He Chengfu, Jiang Hao, and many others. Director Zhao answered them separately as follows: (1) The price adjustments of public utilities in April and May were reviewed by the representatives of the Participating Council. Because the Participating Council was investigating public utilities in June, it was inconvenient to participate. Therefore, the prices of various public utilities were increased by 35% first in June. Up to June, the various prices of public utilities had increased by an average of 279,000 times compared to before the war. The only solution now is to continue to try to ask the central government to approve the settlement of foreign exchange every three months to reduce the cost of materials for public utilities, thereby easing the burden on citizens. (2) There is insufficient electricity in Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong. Currently, 23,000 kilowatts of electricity are still being borrowed from the Shanghai Electric Power Company, but the Electric Power Company itself does not have enough. Recently, one of its generators broke down, so Nanshi often experiences power outages. (3) In addition to allocating more than 100 billion yuan in fines for exceeding electricity limits to the garrison旅, the remaining 50 to 60 billion yuan will be used to purchase materials. There is very little left. The municipal government will submit a detailed report on this. (4) The suspension of Route 7 bus service has been considered repeatedly. Recently, due to the difficulty in obtaining gasoline, and the fact that fare evaders account for 70% of the passengers on the route, it has only been temporarily suspended. (5) It was decided to complete the unified licenses exchange by the end of July. There are still more than 2,000 vehicles that have not been exchanged. (6) Due to traffic conditions and municipal regulations, tricycles照licenses cannot be issued anymore.

### Council, etc., Telegraph Request to Eliminate Professional Students Rescue Academic Integrity Smash Communist Conspiracy

The Shanghai Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Farmers' Association, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Education Association, and other organizations jointly telegraphed President Jiang, Vice President Li, and Premier Weng yesterday, requesting that the Communist Party's professional students in various schools be quickly eliminated with the most severe measures to stabilize schools, rescue academic integrity, smash the Communist conspiracy, and safeguard the foundation of the nation. The original telegram reads: "To President Jiang in Nanjing, Vice President Li, Premier Weng: Since the victory, the Communist bandits have been rebelling with arms, destroying unity, injuring the nation's vitality, and obstructing transportation, causing prices to skyrocket and the people to suffer deeply. Recently, in order to coordinate with their military wandering and political harassment, they have instigated a majority of professional students to use anti-American and pro-Japanese sentiments as a pretext, but to destroy and disrupt as the reality, lurking in various schools. They bewitch and deceive classmates, entice and coerce them, and hold teachers hostage, insult them, act unreasonably, instigate unrest, call for strikes, and create a sense of panic throughout the country.

The United States' support of Japan is originally based on the extremely devastated national economy and people's livelihood in Japan after the war, and is an act of assistance and encouragement based on the humanitarian position that victorious countries should have. If it exceeds the limits of maintaining the survival of the Japanese people, we, learning from the past, should propose protests to the government in a reasonable manner, and should assist the government in launching diplomatic activities to win the understanding and sympathy of friendly countries for the current situation in China, in order to strengthen the implementation of aid to China and promote the success of our nation-building. However, they are not considering this, blindly attacking friendly countries, only knowing how to be anti-American and pro-Japanese, but not advocating that support for Japan should be limited, only knowing how to be anti-American and pro-Japanese, but not advocating to increase aid to China, and even slander the government, disrupt order, disturb people's hearts, lose international sympathy, and plunge our country into turmoil. Their intention is nothing more than to achieve their conspiracy to subvert the government and to achieve their goal of selling out the country.

To secure peace, one must first eliminate violence, and to make decisive choices is paramount. If the government is lenient again, then the professional students who are now lurking in various schools will be the internal line for the Communist bandits to disturb the country in the future, and the future of the country will also be ruined by them, not just sacrificing the studies of thousands of pure young people today. We are deeply aware of the crisis and feel heartbroken. Therefore, we specially telegraphed the above, respectfully requesting that you consider the situation and quickly order the education authorities to take measures to rectify the academic atmosphere with strict and urgent measures. While the front is intensifying the suppression of bandits, the rear must eliminate bandits. We especially hope that the Communist Party's professional students in various schools will be quickly eliminated with the most severe methods in order to stabilize schools, rescue academic integrity, smash the Communist conspiracy, and safeguard the precarious foundation of the nation. We are urgently telegraphing this, begging you to consider, adopt, and implement it. Shanghai Municipal Council, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Municipal Farmers' Association, Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Municipal Education Association." (Yang)

### Soaring Aircraft Fuel Prices Make it Difficult for Two Airlines Li Jinglu and Shanghai Merchants Seek Solutions Preliminary Resolution Reached in the Evening

[Report from our newspaper] The recent surge in aviation gasoline prices, which are increasing wildly, has made it impossible for the two airlines in the city to cope with the difficulties by increasing fares intermittently. Therefore, they have requested that the Ministry of Transportation quickly seek a fundamental solution. It is learned that the Ministry of Transportation has sent Director Li Jinglu of the Civil Aviation Department to Shanghai, and he is closely studying countermeasures with relevant competent authorities. It is said that the methods are no more than two: either let the aviation fares track the oil prices and adjust automatically at any time, or allow the airlines to purchase oil at the state-set exchange rate, starting from stabilizing both oil prices and non-oil prices, and then easing the fares. At present, the aviation gasoline problem has reached an extremely serious situation. According to airline statistics, if February 7 of this year is taken as the base number, the oil price on the 21st of this month has increased to 1673%, the foreign exchange rate has increased to 1216%, and the cost of living index has increased to 354%. According to the aviation cost calculation formula, passenger and freight rates should have been increased to 1068%, but because the Ministry of Transportation has been reluctant to approve it, the increase has only been 369% so far, which is only slightly more than one-third of the amount that should have been increased. According to yesterday's oil prices, the total monthly revenue of the two airlines is not enough to pay for the oil costs for one month. In addition, the foreign exchange required for parts and equipment is even more serious.

[Another report] After Director Li Jinglu of the Civil Aviation Department of the Ministry of Transportation came to Shanghai from Beijing, he negotiated with the Central Bank all day yesterday and only reached a preliminary resolution in the evening. The Central Bank has agreed to lend a month and a half's worth of price difference based on actual gasoline needs (calculated at 755,000 yuan per gallon). It is heard that this will be guaranteed by the Ministry of Transportation. Therefore, the serious problem of a complete shutdown of flights on the 23rd has been temporarily resolved. Today, the flights on all routes will still operate as usual.

### Provisional Motions

Recommend Representatives to Discuss Gasoline Supply Request Municipal Bank to Report on Operations

[Report from our newspaper] Two provisional motions were made before the adjournment of the meeting yesterday: (1) Zhang Zhongyuan and others proposed sending five representatives to participate in the meeting to discuss increasing gasoline supply to be held at the Municipal Government on the 23rd in order to solve the current traffic problem. Resolution: Authorize the Public Utilities Mediation Committee to decide. (2) Chu Shun and others proposed that the Municipal Bank report on its business situation and determine its organizational structure. Resolution: It is not harmful to schedule a time to first invite the bank to send representatives to attend the meeting to report on the bank's business situation. The case will be submitted to the relevant subcommittee for review and then put to discussion.

### Money Market Trend Apparently Loose, But Actually Tight New Prices Repeatedly Seen in the Commodity Market

After the settlement period, the trends of various commodity markets yesterday all showed a rapid rise. The black market for gold and banknotes saw even higher prices. Although the money market was more active than before, the market sentiment was stimulated by the war situation, and the bulls were pulling up strongly, so new prices were repeatedly seen for various commodities. Although yarn and cloth continued to be rationed, it was still difficult to stop the price increases. Since the authorities lifted the price limit on white japonica rice, the price continued to rise sharply yesterday, with door sales reaching 15 million yuan. In addition, factory silk and daily necessities all increased in price.

Yesterday's money market in this city was apparently loose but actually tight because the price increases had not subsided, and those who had funds were all scrambling to buy materials, which made the trend tighter. In the bill exchange of the money shops, the four banks, two bureaus, and one treasury still had a huge net transfer, totaling 1,498.8 billion. Among them, the Central Bank had a net inflow of 840.8 billion, the Bank of China had a net outflow of 536.8 billion, the Bank of Communications had a net inflow of 180.5 billion, the Farmers Bank had a net inflow of 127.3 billion, the Central Trust Bureau had a net inflow of 582.6 billion, the Postal Remittances Bureau had a net inflow of 46.3 billion, the Central Cooperative Treasury had a net inflow of 252.1 billion, the commercial banks had a net outflow of 649.2 billion in large exchanges and a net outflow of 1306 billion in small exchanges, and the foreign banks had a total net inflow of 450.1 billion.

### Lifting Price Controls Solidifies Rising Sentiment Rice Prices Continue to Skyrocket

[Report from our newspaper] Rice prices in the northern and southern rice markets rose sharply yesterday, averaging about 1 million yuan per stone higher than last week. Except for the price limit on medium indica rice, which could not exceed 10 million yuan per stone, the municipal authorities lifted the price limits on the rest, and the market sentiment was exceptionally high. According to Chief Ji of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, "The reason for lifting the price limit is that the prices in the producing areas are higher than in Shanghai, and merchants cannot make a profit, so the import of rice has decreased, which will inevitably lead to a rice shortage and cause serious consequences, so we have to lift the price limit. However, in order to take care of the common people, so that they can buy rice within 10 million yuan, we have set a price limit of 9.8 million yuan per stone for medium indica rice. As for the supply rice, we still sold 6,000 stone yesterday, and the price was still 9.2 million yuan per stone. The People's Mediation Committee also sent many personnel to various rice shops to monitor, in order to prevent the rice from flowing into the black market."

Yesterday's rice prices in the Southern Market: White japonica rice 13.2 million yuan, thin indica rice 13.4 million yuan, early rice 12.8 million yuan, wild indica rice 11.5 million yuan. Rice prices in the Northern Market: White japonica rice 13.9 million yuan, thin indica rice 13.7 million yuan, early rice 13.2 million yuan, sheep indica rice 13.5 million yuan. A total of 8,188 stone of rice arrived at the northern and southern markets. Including 6,000 stone of supply rice, the total amount of rice flowing into the market yesterday was 14,188 stone.

Flour is rising steadily. "Bingshuan" flour opened at 4.1 million yuan, and because the price of rice showed signs of weakening, it was raised to 4.45 million yuan, the same increase of 150,000 yuan as "Lao Che" flour. "Jian Cheng" and "Hong Feng" flour each increased by 130,000 yuan. Large-package wheat bran sold for 3.8 million yuan, an increase of 350,000 yuan. Wheat sold for 6 million yuan.

Coarse grains rose and fell alternately. Soybeans struggled to rise in the morning. "Zha Dou" fell slightly by 200,000 yuan, while "Ben Dou" rose by 100,000 yuan. Corn from the northern gangs was not purchased, and the market fell by 700,000 yuan. Sesame fell sharply by more than 2 million yuan. Raw peanuts from Dawenkou rose by 1 million yuan, and those from Xuzhou increased by 500,000 yuan, while the rest remained flat. Picked white beans fell slightly by 200,000 yuan, and mung beans increased by 500,000 yuan.

Edible oil was flat and weak. Qingdao Jishi barrel oil sold for 41.5 million yuan, slightly higher by 500,000 yuan. The factory's own soybean oil opened at 29.5 million yuan and steadily increased to 30.4 million yuan, slightly higher by 200,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil was lower by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Jishi small barrel and old barrel熟菜油熟 rapeseed oil each fell slightly by 500,000 yuan. Soybean cake汕帮from Shantou still had demand, supply and demand were equal, and the market was stable.

### Shanghai's Monthly Edible Oil Consumption is About 40,000 Dan

[Report from our Nanjing, 22nd] Ministry of Economic Affairs news: According to a survey by the China Vegetable Oil Plant, the total amount of edible oil needed in Shanghai each month is more than 40,000 dan. Judging from the oil extraction equipment in Shanghai, it can produce 140,000 tons of oil per month, but due to funding and electricity issues, only one-third of the machines are currently in operation, so the edible oil produced is only enough for consumption in areas such as Beijing and Shanghai.

### Sugar Quotas Increase

Yesterday, the sugar market initially tightened and then softened because the Taiwan Company标特綿白biaote mianbai allocated in large quantities. The allocation price was 18 million yuan, and a total of 45,200+ bags were allocated. Some were allocated on the same day. The highest price was 18.35 million yuan, and the lowest was 17.8 million yuan. The calculation still needs to lose money. Other rises and falls were not much. Local sugar was slightly tight, rising by 700,000 to 1.2 million yuan, and the market may stabilize.

### Green Tea Market Stable

Recently, the tea market has seen significant increases because those holding goods are unwilling to lag behind and have begun to sell. Especially for green tea, in addition to exporters actively searching for "Da Bang" and other types of tea, this year's Longjing tea, both in the main street and in the rural villages, is being bought regardless of price, and the selling price is becoming more vigorous.

It is learned that Qimen black tea has recently been gradually planned to be purchased and absorbed in the main street, but the market inventory is insufficient, so the bottom is very strong.

### Artificial Silk Prices Fluctuate Factory-Processed Silk Goods Jump

The price of artificial silk fluctuated greatly yesterday, rising and falling suddenly.

The price of 120 gold Sanma有光youguang opened at 740 million yuan in the morning, rising steadily, reaching a maximum of 810 million yuan, and closing at 770 million yuan for the selling price at noon. The lowest price in the afternoon was 740 million yuan, and the price rebounded to 530 million yuan at the close.

The market for factory-processed silk goods jumped yesterday. B-grade goods shouted prices close to 1 billion yuan, but because the price was too high, buyers were restrained, so transactions were rare. D-grade goods were traded for 910 million yuan in the morning. Scattered odd lots were priced at 50 million yuan. The asking price for scattered lots of "Qian Jing" was also as high as 700 million yuan. The market was slightly weak in the afternoon due to the fall in artificial silk, but there were no transactions.

The silk market rose rapidly yesterday. The opening price of "Hua Qiang" real silk quilt covers was as high as 395 million yuan in the morning, with a maximum of 970 million yuan, then fell to around 900 million yuan, and then fell to 87 million yuan at the close for the spot price. The opening price for the "Ge Zi Bi Zou" warehouse order was 1.48 million yuan, and the closing price was 450,000 yuan.

Buyers from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other regions were actively purchasing, and trading unfolded in the market.

Later, with the rise in cloth prices, buyers absorbed everything on offer, and the market price soared again, once approaching the 700 million yuan mark. As the closing approached, those with floating profits settled on the day, and scattered sellers took advantage of the high prices to sell off. Credit tightened, and the cloth market fell slightly, eventually closing at 675 million yuan. This was a sharp increase of 50 million yuan compared to before the holiday.

Around 10:30, a new high price of 149 million yuan was created. When news of a large-scale sell-off by the authorities was heard, those with floating profits sold off, and traders also resold, so the price fell back to 146 million yuan at the close, which was a sharp increase of 16 million yuan compared to before the holiday. The markets for other cloths were also very firm and high. After the close, credit suddenly tightened on all sides, sentiment turned weak, and bulls started to sell off. Outside the market, the price decreased to 144 million yuan and then even sold down to 140 million yuan for "Longtou" cloth, and the prices of other cloths also fell from the closing prices.

### High Prices Difficult to Sustain: Chinese Stocks Close Weak

Chinese stocks, though propelled to high prices yesterday by materials and Hong Kong Electric, could not sustain the gains. The threat of tight credit conditions and the National Bank's heavy selling of materials led to a weak close.

The morning opened steady due to high real goods prices. Wing Spinning debuted at $4240, advancing to $4375. Due to increased supply, it gradually weakened. Agency fees opened high at $38 and $43, retreating to $4280. Hong Kong Electric's price reduction was limited to two jiao. Cotton cloth jumped again, buying interest increased, and prices rose to a high of $4400. The National Bank heavily sold materials, displaying caution, and prices fell to $4250. The noon close was $4285. Compared to before the holiday, except for Datong and Xinhua rising to the limit, and Commercial Press, Huaxin, and Zhongxing each rising by half a percent, the rest showed only slight increases.

In the afternoon, Wing Spinning opened at $4310. Numbers 245 and 157 were sold off, causing a drop to $4190. Numbers 71 and 205 were bought, but the National Bank's intervention was limited, leading to a rebound to $4275. Numbers 116 and 190 were sold, forcing another drop to $4200. The closing price was $4235. Compared to the morning close, Huaxin underwear fell by half a percent, China-France and Xinguang remained flat, and the rest experienced small declines. In the over-the-counter market, World stocks were uniquely sought after, rising by 20%, while the rest rose from slightly to up to 10%.

Government bonds fell yesterday, with trading volume remaining around 4 million. Series C started at 640,000 in the morning, falling to a low of 530,000 before stabilizing slightly. Compared to before the holiday, Series A and B fell by 70,000, Series C fell by 120,000, Series D fell by 80,000, and Series E also fell by slightly less than 90,000.

Foreign stocks: Buying interest strengthened yesterday due to the Hong Kong military's losses. Jardine Spinning opened at 8.3 million, rising steadily to a new high of 9 million, before retreating to close at 8.4 million. Money exchangers sold, while foreign and Guangdong merchants bought. Compared to before the holiday, Jardine Spinning and Guangdong Steel rose by about 10%, Wheelock Marden and Guangdong Haocheng rose by half, and Jardine Matheson rose slightly, with the rest rising by half a percent.

### Private Universities Have Their Own Traditional Characteristics: Ministry of Education Adopts Grant-in-Aid Policy; Hang Liwu Speaks on the Nationalization of Kwang Hwa and Great China Universities

[Our Nanjing, 22nd Dispatch] Vice Minister of Education Hang Liwu, on the 22nd, spoke on the matter of Kwang Hwa and Great China Universities requesting nationalization, stating: "Since the restoration, given the lack of manpower and material resources, the government has decided not to establish new national universities in the short term. Due to financial difficulties and the urgent need to strengthen existing national schools, it is impossible to nationalize private schools. China has vast territory, and if universities rely solely on state sponsorship, it will be difficult to achieve the goal of educational and cultural development. Therefore, the Ministry has always adopted a policy of awarding, assisting, and cultivating private universities. Furthermore, private universities have their own traditional characteristics and should be allowed to develop freely. The government will do its best to assist private schools in terms of funding and other aspects. The expectation of private school students to obtain public funding after nationalization is also impossible. The public funding system has now been changed to scholarships, and students who did not receive public funding originally will not be eligible for it simply because of nationalization."

[Another Dispatch] A student delegation from Great China University, including Ma Yunda and five others, petitioned the Ministry of Education on the 22nd regarding the request for nationalization. Director Tang of the Higher Education Department received them and promised to convey their opinions.

### Tsinghua University: Currently Has Five Colleges, Twenty-Six Departments, and Twenty-Three Graduate Institutes

[Our Beiping, 1st Air Dispatch] Tsinghua is probably the most suitable university for studying in the country. The professors, facilities, campus, and traditions are all the best.

Tsinghua has changed its name three times so far. It was founded three years before the founding of the Republic of China, using the surplus Boxer Indemnity returned by the United States as a condition for sending students to study in the United States, and was initiated by the Bureau of Educational Missions to the United States. At that time, there were only secondary and higher courses. After the founding of the Republic of China, Tsinghua became an independent school. Its university foundation was formed in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, when it began to enroll freshmen. The graduation of these students ended its nature as a preparatory school for studying in the United States and became a complete university. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army was successful, and it was renamed National Tsinghua University by a resolution of the National Government. In the eighteenth year, a graduate school was added, and the equipment in various departments was gradually completed. During this period, Yen Hui-ching, Tang Guoan, Zhou Yichun, and Luo Jialun successively presided over the school's administration. The current president, Mei Yi-qi, entered the school in the fourth year of the Republic of China and assumed the position of president in the twentieth year. In the twenty-first year, the College of Engineering was added, and in the twenty-third year, preparations were made to establish the College of Agriculture, gradually completing the current scale.

In the twenty-sixth year, the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, and Tsinghua moved south, initially joining with Peking University and Nankai University in Changsha to form the Temporary University. In the twenty-seventh year, it moved to Yunnan and was reorganized into the Southwest Associated University. After the victory, it moved back to Beiping. Two years of construction have restored the old appearance of Tsinghua.

Tsinghua currently has five colleges, twenty-six departments, and twenty-three graduate institutes. It can be called a perfect university in terms of scale, and there are many first-class professors. President Mei Yi-qi, Provost Wu Zelin, and Dean of Student Affairs Chu Shiquan are all well-known scholars in the country and do not need much introduction. In terms of professors, Feng Youlan, Zhu Ziqing, Chen Yinke, Wu Mi, Wu Han, and Pei Wenzhong in the College of Liberal Arts; Ye Qisun, Yang Wuzhi, Wu Youxun, Chen Zhen, and Yuan Fuli in the College of Science; Chen Daisun, Zhang Xiruo, and Pan Guangdan in the College of Law; Liu Xianzhou, Shi Jiazheng, Zhuang Qianding, and Liang Sicheng in the College of Engineering; Tang Peisong, Dai Fanglan, and Liu Chongle in the College of Agriculture; and Ma John in the Department of Physical Education are all first-class famous professors. Professor governance is the tradition of Tsinghua. The highest authority is the University Council, composed of the president and heads of various departments, which decides on administrative policies. The Professors' Council decides on teaching, research, and improvements in academic atmosphere. Furthermore, there are twenty-five committees established according to the needs of school affairs, in addition to five academic committees and five academic publications.

Generally, Tsinghua is most valued for its simple and honest academic atmosphere, which is free of bureaucratic airs. The students are generally of a high standard, and all are fortunate to be able to enter Tsinghua. The professors all have small houses on campus where they can teach in peace, unaffected by external disturbances. The school can also understand the feelings of teachers and students and does not interfere excessively. Everyone regards Tsinghua Garden as their own home, so it is not uncommon to find faculty and staff who have served at Tsinghua for ten or twenty years. Professors can take a one-year sabbatical after seven years of service. Yang Yezhi, Yu Ruihuang, Zhang Yintang, Xu Yutan, Tao Baokai, Xun Shuping, Wu Liusheng, and Huang Ziqing will be on sabbatical next semester. All of the above are funded by the school to study in the United States. In addition, Zhu Ziqing, Zhang Xiruo, and Wu Han are on sabbatical in the country. Liu Chongle, Wu Dayuan, Fan Xujun, and Ye Kai will soon return from their sabbaticals.

Provost Wu Zelin said that Tsinghua is striving for balanced development in all departments. Generally, the College of Engineering is considered to be more famous. Tsinghua has departments such as the Department of Sociology, Department of Anthropology, Department of Architectural Engineering, Department of Plant Pathology, Department of Agronomy, and Department of Meteorology, which are not found in other schools.

Tsinghua currently has a total of 2,500 students. About 300 will graduate this year, and the summer enrollment will not exceed 500. In the past, graduates had excellent career prospects, with each graduate having three to five job opportunities. Last year, due to the influence of the situation, engineering students still had two opportunities to choose from, while law students had an average of one in four. This year, it is a luxury for each engineering student to have one opportunity, and the situation is even worse for other departments. Until now, few people have shown interest.

Public funding for new students has been discontinued, and in the future, they can only compete for "public funding" within the 20% quota for scholarships. Students from "difficult areas" can receive relief funds. In addition, the Christian student commune can assist some students in exchanging work for meals. The school allocates them more than 20 acres of land, and the income can support dozens of people. It is conceivable that their lives will become increasingly difficult in the future.

### World Games Four Wins in Four Matches, Defeated Dagong Last Night

[Our Dispatch] The World Games basketball team's fourth match in Shanghai, although not played with full strength last night, still defeated Dagong with a score of 53 to 42. The first half was 28 to 19. World Games team coordination still needs improvement, relying solely on individual skills to win. Of the players, Huang Tianxi performed the best. Li Shiqiao's passing is still the key to the offense, but his shooting seemed less brilliant than in previous matches. Dagong's loss of Wen Hua and Zhong Qiang, its two supporting pillars, greatly affected its strength. Offense and defense were full of loopholes, and Tu Wenlong was out of form, with only one out of ten long and short shots hitting the mark. Dagong remained at a disadvantage throughout.

The match began at 7:10 PM, refereed by Wang Yiqiao and Xuan Hegao. Wen Hua of the World Games team was injured in the hand, Zhong Qiang was injured in the foot, and Yu Jin mistakenly reported. Li Shiqiao, Cheng Zhang, Zhi Jun, Tian Xi, and Song Yuan were deployed at the last minute. Dagong countered with Cai Jindian, Wu Kangkai, Tu Wenlong, Huang Boling, and Cai Lianke. The World Games team got the ball, made three quick passes, and Jia Zhijun scored under the basket, taking the lead. Tian Xi scored two points using his smoke screen technique. Adi scored two points under the basket, making it 6 to 0. Boling made one free throw, recording the first point for Dagong. The World Games team led all the way, and when the score was 16 to 7, Dagong's new player Xu Zhongyi replaced Lianke. When the difference was six goals at 22 to 10, Dagong took a time-out. Lianke was replaced by Kangkai. As the first half was about to end, Wenlong and Zhongyi scored three points, reducing the score to 19 to 28.

After a short break, Rui Zhang entered the game for the World Games team, and Adi was substituted out. Lao Bao scored, and Jindian immediately returned the favor. Boling made another shot, making the score 26 to 33, creating a tense situation with only five points separating the teams. This was the heyday of Dagong. Adi returned, replacing Rui Zhang, and the situation gradually improved. The scoring was steady, and after 44 to 33, the game became a back-and-forth affair, maintaining a difference of around five goals. The final score was 53 to 42, with the World Games team winning four victories.

### Green Window Night Talk

— Zhao Qingge

It's rare to have such a cool evening, and such tranquility. I count the sounds from my desk, as it "tick-tocks," recounting to me many smoky past events, also telling me of an infinitely ethereal future. I don't like dwelling on the past, nor do I like longing for the future; I only want to settle into the present, because I am living in this most real present.

Everyone has their own different attitudes towards life, each has their own different philosophical concepts; thus, each has their own different way of life. Based on my own way of dealing with the world and philosophical concepts, I arrived at this way of life of "settling into the present." To me, it brings absolute peace of mind, but my friends see it as out of touch with the trend, too passive.

Lately, friends have been directly or indirectly asking me, asking why I am no longer seen at any literary gatherings? Asking why I don't participate in any social activities? Asking why I don't even go to entertainment venues? Some readers have also written, asking why my articles are published less frequently, whether I have already changed careers and stopped writing.

I know that friends and readers are concerned about me, which is why they raise so many questions to challenge me. In addition to expressing my heartfelt gratitude, I take advantage of this cool and peaceful night, sitting by the window, bathed in the bright moonlight, and tentatively open my heart to frankly talk to you about my recent situation. I don't want you to misunderstand me, but I also don't hope you pity me.

I said, I'm becoming someone who just wants to settle into the present—when I discovered that there was not much hope left in this world, and that one's past and future had turned to dust, I resolutely took this rather selfish path. By doing this, I neither create conflict with others, nor do I make myself dirty, remaining still and quiet. I am grateful for this great era filled with neverending warfare, as it awakened my soul.

In the past, during the turbulent eight years of the national war of resistance, I was not without excitement; for the supreme ideal, I devoted my heart and soul amidst the gunfire, I wrote tirelessly thousands upon thousands of words of struggle, and I participated with friends in all meaningful social activities. I was originally an enthusiastic and vigorous person!

However, eight years later, victory came, but the country was still turbulent! And even more clouded and bleak! Friends, people's hearts are scattered, no one is as closely connected as before, and no one's situation is so simple. Literary gatherings have become empty social gatherings, and social activities are always fruitless. Everyone's ideals gradually disappeared in the storms!

Thus I say: past efforts have turned to dust, and future pursuits are still a pile of dust.

In view of this, I can only settle into the present. I discarded all heroic ideas that I knew would become dust, and made my spirit and emotions detach from the world, living a peaceful life in a self-centered realm.

Don't compete with things; don't compete with people; with few desires, there are fewer worries. For example, recently the landlord sued me, forcing me to move out. I can only let the law punish me and I am too lazy to spend energy to deal with those coercing me. When rice and flour prices rise, I am used to being a vegetarian anyway. I can barely make a living with a pen from vegetables and coarse rice. It's only the price of cigarettes that gives me a headache! Quit? It's been more than ten years, it's not easy, and it's too abusive to myself; moreover, inspiration is related. Don't quit? It costs more than food. Therefore, the cigarette problem has really troubled me these past two days.

Dancing, I played with it for a while, but later I felt that it was like drinking, getting drunk once in a while is okay, but getting drunk often is meaningless. It is better to watch a good movie. Otherwise, I'd rather play dominoes alone, "Passing Five Gates", "Capturing Meng Huo" to forget the fatigue of the day.

Who says I don't write articles anymore? Before I learn other life skills, I will not change careers. But it is true that I don't publish casually. If selling a manuscript can sustain me for some days, then during this period I will specialize in writing things that I like, regardless of whether publishers will accept them in the future, I just need to be happy when I look at them.

That's how I live a very stable life now—and I seize this "present" "stability".

The so-called "conforming to the trend", in this era of unclear right and wrong, and perverse actions, has no standard. The trend is moving towards a democratic and peaceful road, but ambitious people insist on running in the opposite direction. Do you force yourself to go straight? There are thorns and bushes ahead. Do you also seek to curry favor with those in power? Conscience does not allow it. So you can only stop at the right time and follow the ancient saying: "Mingzhe baoshen," or "The wise protect themselves."

I do not deny that this attitude of dealing with the world is somewhat pessimistic, but where has my heroism gone? It has been worn away by the infinitely cruel facts—those cruel facts, like maggots, gnawing away at my vitality year after year, making me too tired to fight against the demons who create cruel facts! But, who can know that my pessimism is not a kind of cultivation; a kind of patience; a kind of accumulating strength? Therefore, I do not admit that my pessimism is surrender, or even shame.

I often think: Silence may not be a kind of silent revenge. I don't even want to complain anymore. I hate the current reality so much that I don't bother to ask about it anymore. I transcend my thoughts and emotions to another realm. I want to extricate myself from deep love and hate, in order to settle into the present—

The clock is always ticking non-stop, it is working hard to push away the night, but also actively pulling tomorrow closer, but it itself cannot understand how far the distance is in between? It seems like a blind horse, forever galloping in the endless abyss, galloping towards the end of the world.

In the silence, I see my heart is also ticking like the clock, ticking so evenly, so peacefully, and yet so endlessly, ticking! Ticking—until my doomsday comes.

The moon has drilled into the clouds, the night is deep!

Let the clock continue to tick with this heart, but my rambling must end here.

(The fifth day after the Dragon Boat Festival in the thirty-seventh year)

### Thoughts Inspired by Yang Mei

— Xie Bingying

Speaking of it, it's a bit embarrassing. Yang Mei's nine years without eating is considered a great miracle in the world, so from the chairman of the province to doctors, nurses, scholars, celebrities, as well as peddlers and laborers, everyone is paying attention to this news, and I don't know how many people are thinking of becoming the second Yang Mei. In fact, being able to live without eating is not such an amazing thing. Don't we often see news in the newspapers about the late Saint Gandhi's fasts? He often fasted for ten or twenty days at a time. At that time, why didn't anyone study how Gandhi could live without eating? And with a normal spirit, just like peacetime, he could still look at official business and handle all daily affairs?

When I was in my teens, I often saw many people from Xinhua County or Baoqing Prefecture walking to Mount Heng in Nanyue to offer incense. Some offered blood basin incense, some offered musk incense, some offered mourning incense (incense promised due to illness before death must still be offered after death). There was a special kind called "hunger incense". Those offering incense, regardless of men, women, old or young, from the eve of departure until the day of their return, no matter how many days passed, could not taste anything, not even the cold water from the shopkeeper. Each of them had a dipper like a wine cup inserted on their neck. When they encountered a waterfall or a particularly clean spring, they would use the dipper to scoop up some water to drink, and they did not feel any hunger at all, and like the others, they could run eighty or ninety miles a day. The most rare thing was that some old women in their fifties or sixties, with their bound feet with three-inch golden lotuses, could also run eighty or ninety miles a day without eating anything. In their view, everything was naturally blessed by the Bodhisattva. At that time, a story like this was most popular: An old man went to Nanyue to offer hunger incense. When he walked halfway, he was so hungry that he could no longer bear it. He secretly picked a peach on the road and ate it. Unexpectedly, as soon as the peach entered his mouth and was crushed, the man vomited violently and died immediately. Beside him, the pieces of peach he vomited out suddenly turned into a complete peach, so that passers-by knew that he had died suddenly because of stealing food.

Of course, this is 100% superstition and absolutely unreliable! But the fact that people who offer hunger incense do not eat anything is an ironclad fact, just like those who offer worship incense, some kneel every three steps and bow every five steps. Such troublesome and arduous movements, he does not mess up a step, nor does he feel tired, and walking does not become slower than others. Sometimes they walk faster than ordinary people. When people offering worship incense pass by, children are particularly happy to watch, because their clothing is special. Their heads are tied with blue cloth and tied with red ribbons, they wear red bibs on their chests, and the movements of kneeling and getting up are particularly fast, as light and swift as a dragonfly skimming the water. Each of them holds a small stool for inserting incense, all lacquered red, which is extremely fun. The villagers said that these incense-offering people are not hungry or tired because the Bodhisattva is showing his spirit. In fact, this is entirely a mental effect. If we look at the biographies of many scientists and artists, they often devote themselves to a certain problem with all their heart and soul, and they will forget to eat and sleep. During the War of Resistance, how many soldiers could not eat a grain of rice or drink a sip of water for three or four consecutive days on the front line. They still shot at the enemy on the front line and charged into battle. People can cope with the environment. When there is no food to eat, he can not eat. When there is a need to take risks, the courage will be particularly great.

Our country is a country where feudal forces have dominated society for the longest time, so there are various sayings about being able to survive without eating. I saw an old Taoist in Mao Nu Cave in Mount Hua who had not eaten for ten years. His abstaining from grains was to get rid of worldly existence and become an immortal. He was already more than seventy years old, but he looked only like he was in his fifties. His body was very strong, and the skin on his face was the same as that of ordinary people, and he did not appear particularly anemic or haggard. He eats fruits from trees and ferns from the ground. Walnuts, pine nuts, and Chinese ginseng are all special products of Mount Hua. Each year, in addition to a small portion being provided to the old Taoist who abstains from grains, at least three or four thousand catties are sold to tourists. Our scientists should have studied why they can live long lives by eating only these plants.

Finally, I would like to talk about my own experience of hunger. The first time I studied at Shanghai Art University, I was so poor that I was hungry for three days. I only drank tap water and did not eat anything. The second time I was in the French Concession police station, I didn't eat a single meal or drink a drop of water for three whole days. According to my experience, not eating is still bearable, but not drinking water is simply deadly! Especially in summer, water is the source of life. Without water, people will die of thirst! When I was in prison in Japan, I didn't eat for a week. I only drank a small glass of water every day. I watched the prisoners in the same cell eating with relish, but I turned a blind eye and did not feel any appetite at all. Why did I have to fast at that time? On the one hand, because the rice cooked with those moldy rice was really unbearable to swallow, and the stinky fish placed on the bento box made me vomit at the sight of it. I asked them to give me bread, but they ignored me, so I stubbornly refused to eat: first, to show them my protest, and second, I also wanted to do an experiment on myself to see how many days I could go without eating and whether I would starve to death. If I starved to death, it would save the Japanese imperialists from insulting me and shooting me again, wouldn't that be great? During these seven days, because I originally had stomach problems, I did not feel the pressure of hunger at all. The most unbearable thing was thirst. I wanted to drink water—sometimes my throat was so dry that fire came out, and it seemed that my intestines were about to be burned off. At this time, if someone gave me a cup of sewage from a ditch, or even someone else's urine, I might drink it without hesitation.

Speaking of science, I am an amateur, and I am also anxious for our scientists! It has been more than a month, why hasn't any breakthrough been researched about Yang Mei? In particular, I am very surprised that Provincial Chairman Yang only pays attention to the problem of Yang Mei's not eating, but ignores the problem of the poor people in Sichuan Province not having food to eat. Just as I was writing this, the newspaper boy brought the newspaper. The news of the rice riots in Chongqing was published on the first page of the Beiping Daily, along with an editorial. This is not only a serious problem in Chongqing, but also a serious problem in all parts of the country. I hope that all scientists, politicians, scholars, and celebrities who are studying Yang Mei, if they cannot find out the reason, should abandon Yang Mei as soon as possible, let her resume her freedom and live her original life, and turn their eyes to the more than 300 million poor people. How can we enable them to survive? I think this is the only biggest problem in China at present! (Written in the old capital on June 18, 1937)

### Autumn Landscape

### Tiannan Hermit Wang Tao's Extant Poems: Miscellaneous Feelings in Shanghai, Eight Poems

Holding back the payment of soldier's salaries is without end, building temporary walls while the bandits are not yet captured, Heaven lends the chief criminal a white head, great disasters emerge as refined gold; continuous camps make soldiers old, and many voices fill the wilderness with wrong notes; my eyes see the Southeast's overall situation ruined, alone I stroke my short hair and sigh sorrowfully.

Spring has few sunny days in March, and it is difficult for hundreds of thousands of soldiers to make a decisive battle; the military spirit is not high, and heavy rain sinks in, omens of killing have appeared as strict frost; I already know that celestial phenomena concern the current situation, and I hope that talents will plan for stability and security; today we must plan attack and defense strategies, and the key to prevention is to decide the rushing waves.

The exhausted enemy knows that Wei and Zhao are connected, and secretly appears from Yinping; they only seek a slow death and stake everything, not expecting simultaneous defeats in surrounding cities; broken aiding armies continue the war, and the neighboring soldiers guarding the walls are frightened three times a day; originally Wu and Yue were like lips and teeth, and when the bandits retreat, they all hear celebrations of rebirth.

The worries for Wu and Yue are great, and the Southeast has rested for half the country; the people of four counties are all caught in banditry, and a hundred years of killing fortune begins in autumn; He Xun's body leaves the Jiangbiao, and Tao Kan's army still descends upstream, wanting to knock on the camp gate to offer strange strategies, and writing on life with an unfavorable fate.

Suddenly seeing beacon fires in Jiangnan, I suddenly hear of soldiers in the far north; the pole star is worried about losing its position, and the soldiers surrounding the city suddenly empty their camps; sticking to the middle of peace and war was originally not a plan, and begging for alliances does not begin with kindness and prestige; I am in difficulties and danger, and he is arrogant, and from now on, there will be matters on the sea frontier.

Often thinking of stepping into the sea, I worry about whales, wanting to return home full of tigers and wolves, my life is exhausted and I only lack death, and the world is full of events and it is also in vain; my former friends are now soldier ghosts, the old lakes and mountains are new battlefields, wanting to find a clean land in front of me, a wave of dusk soaks the setting sun.

The corner is still a safe place, and avoiding trouble can still be a tenant, worrying about the world, can Jia Yi truly be lacking; and arguing to be thin with Yang Xiong; ten thousand places of war and massacre grieve the new robbery, and generations of literature have changing winds; bitterly speaking to you, what strategy will you use to assist prosperity?

Able to fight for fortune to help the declining situation, to quell difficulties and create this side; since ancient times, generals were born in troubled times, hearing that they are already enrolled in military ranks; the imperial court repeatedly orders to search for hermits, and what kind of people in the wilderness move the temple corridors; worldly affairs are truly ruined from this, tiredly opening my sleepy eyes and reading the changing world.

A bundle of Wang Tao's extant letters from Tiannan Hermit, containing fifty or sixty draft poems, obtained from the descendants of Wang's wife's brother, Yang Xingbu. In addition to other textual research, I now transcribe eighteen "Miscellaneous Feelings in Shanghai" to fulfill Shen Bao. Wu Feng appended.

### Recent World Literary Scene

— Zhao Jingshen

New research on Arnold

The great British critic Matthew Arnold is, besides Dickens, the most worthy of our attention in the Victorian era, and he still lives in our hearts to this day. He is being studied by many people. Biographies about him will not be much of a failure. His personal life is very dull, almost indescribable, so the biographers focus on introducing his thoughts or extracting his articles, so it won't be dull. In the past, although we had Lionel Trilling's satisfying and detailed research that had received the sympathy and praise of Saintsbury, and C. B. Tinker and Howard F. Lowry's continued research, we still don't mind having two new books of research on Arnold.

Coincidentally, the names of these two authors are both spelled K.E. They both describe Arnold in all aspects as a person, poet, and thinker. Chambers' book is only 144 pages long, published by the Oxford University Press, and provides many documentary dates, numbers, genealogy, and the like. Brown's book makes in-depth observations, believing that Arnold spent his entire life in the struggle between contemplation and action.

Chambers only makes literary explorations. He is a diligent collector of events. But this book, although full of dates and genealogies, is not a biography. It is roughly divided into chapters such as Arnold's youth, civil servant, poet, professor, philosopher, old age, and personality. Unfortunately, he underestimates the reader too much, for example, pointing out that Emerson is American, Spinoza is a 17th-century philosopher, or Yale University is located somewhere in the United States, which is unnecessary for people who want to study Arnold. Even the occasional remarks are mediocre, such as saying that his drama is better than bad love poems, and that objectivity is more important than subjectivity.

Brown is deeply immersed in Arnold. He can effortlessly grasp the entirety of Arnold. The scholarly detailed annotations are also worthy of praise. The writing is elegant and the theme is clear. Brown also talks about Arnold's "disinterestedness". This attitude is the best attitude in human life. Arnold is a keen absorber, like a bee collecting beeswax in distant fields. Democracy should absorb culture, and culture should also absorb democracy. In short, he tried his best to absorb the best things. He opposed localism. Because of him, the taste of British literature has expanded widely.

### Landlords Rampant with Cash Payments for Rice: Monthly Rent of Five Dou with Gratuitous Extra Charge of Ten Shi: The Suffering of Small People in Empty Housing Rumors

Yang Yuesheng asks: My friend rented a house from A in January of the 36th year. The contract stated that my friend must first pay a tip of 600,000 yuan, and pay monthly rent of five dou of white rice, converted into market price, for a lease term of three years, with water and electricity to be paid by himself. Later, due to the difference between the official price of rice and the black market, disputes often arose. Recently, disputes have also arisen due to the cash payment for rice, and both parties insist on their own opinions and refuse to give in. Now there are several legal questions, please answer as a thank you! (1) According to the above situation, is it legal to calculate the rent according to the price of rice? What kind of rice price should be used for cash conversion? (2) The newspaper on the first of this month reported the rent case resolved by the Municipal Council, calculated at 7,000 to 9,000 times the rent in the 26th year. May I ask whether the house where my friend lives can enjoy the same rights? (3) The contract states that my friend must first pay a small fee of 600,000 yuan. Can the money, which could buy ten shi of rice at the time, be sued for improper profit and requested to be used as prepaid rent for 20 months?

[Lawyer Tang Mingshi answers] (1) Tips are far forbidden, and collecting rent in kind is also illegal. The rice price on the contract usually follows the rice price published by Weixin. (2) The highest price of rent decided by the Council is a measure of determining the rent. If the contract has already been made, it seems that it is not the intention to maintain order to cancel it uniformly and revise it again; I am afraid it will be inevitable to involve litigation. (3) The tip cannot be established and can be used as rent.

### Model of "Official Talent"

— Xuan Xuan

(1) Has the spirit of minding one's own business, can be busy with what the people are free with, can be free with what the people are busy with.

(2) Not good at writing is no obstacle to being an official; if good at writing, one must be good at writing the articles that people dislike the most.

(3) On the surface, one can obey the superiors most, but in reality, one can disobey the superiors most; superiors can do nothing, and the people can do nothing. This is the best choice for "official talent."

(4) Strive for no visible mistakes, but do not seek to have meritorious achievements.

(5) Always gives people hope, thinking that his words may be lucky and hit the mark one day, although his words have never been fulfilled.

(6) First have what the world has, and then toil after the world has toiled.

(7) The nerves are particularly sensitive. If someone scolds a sentence, he will think it must be scolding him, because in his opinion, the person who should be scolded probably won't be someone else.

(8) Believes that being an official is a right, and being a commoner is a duty.

(9) Can believe that one is the best good person.

(10) Can believe that the cost of living index published at the end of each month is accurate.

### Inspiration

— Zhu Shilin

I have had such experiences several times: When I am trapped by a certain problem in life, I often cannot break through the encirclement no matter how hard I try. The harder I try, the more I get into a dead end, until I am exhausted and have no courage to struggle anymore. I see that I have no choice but to accept the control of fate. Occasionally, waking up in the middle of the night, in the quietness and solitude, suddenly a surge, like a flash of light, sweeps through my mind. I try to consider it, and I feel that this idea is the most ideal way to deal with the current difficulty. At that time, I was very surprised, why couldn't I think of it so foolishly during the day? Later, I finally relied on this momentary strange idea to solve my problem. I believe readers must have had similar experiences.

The difference in intelligence between geniuses and ordinary people is very subtle, even equal. But why are geniuses such a minority among minorities, and why do most people end up mediocre? Of course, environment and education are important factors, but the most decisive factor is that geniuses immediately grasp and utilize inspiration when it comes. Ordinary people also have inspiration, but they often dismiss it as a ridiculous fantasy. Otherwise, the civilization of today's world would definitely be more than this.

For example, the "explorer" Renault, although a big swindler, his whole life is spent somersaulting in adventures and speculations, but his character of seizing opportunities and making decisive decisions is indeed outstanding. Otherwise, how could a pauper climb to his current position? It is said that this time he came to China to explore, taking full advantage of the fact that exploration planes can be exempt from inspection to engage in smuggling, and once again claimed that the plane's fuel tank was leaking, resulting in another "savage head," making a fortune in this "adventurer's paradise." How could others think of such an idea! Regardless of whether his behavior is proper, it is always an expression of his inspiration. To give another example: In the biopic of Edison, Edison used thousands of substances to try making filaments for the light bulb, but none of them gave satisfactory results. Continuous work and failure exhausted him, eventually leading from disappointment to discouragement. Suddenly, he saw his assistant's face full of whiskers, and a strange idea came to him. He quickly pulled out a beard hair as his experimental material, but unfortunately it still didn't work—otherwise, inspiration would have created another miracle.

Inspiration comes entirely by chance and cannot be forced. It exists in the subconscious, rarely appearing, often when there are no external disturbances and the mind is calm. Sakyamuni meditated under the Bodhi tree for decades in pursuit of the true meaning of birth, old age, sickness, and death, with no results. Finally, inspiration came, and the long-sought answer was obtained once. Everyone has this possibility, the problem is how to view it. If you can grasp it and utilize it, the success you will achieve will be unbelievable even to yourself.

### Creation and Inspiration

— Lianhu

When Goethe was twenty-three years old, he fell in love with a woman who was already engaged, Charlotte. Frustrated and unable to resolve it, he was planning to commit suicide when he suddenly heard the news of a friend's suicide due to unrequited love. It was as if he suddenly saw a flash of inspiration, flashing before his eyes. He immediately figured out the outline of the entire book "The Sorrows of Young Werther." He wrote it down in one breath and completed it in less than two weeks. Then he reviewed the manuscript and felt very surprised, because he had not made any effort at all. He said, "This booklet seems to have been written by a sleepwalker in a coma."

The musician Periot set the poem "May Fifth" by Yuan Rangjie to music. When he reached the final refrain, "Poor soldier, I will finally see France again," he suddenly stopped. After thinking over and over again, he finally couldn't think of a melody to convey the emotions of the refrain. Two years later, he was traveling in Rome and accidentally fell into the river. He was rescued and did not drown. The melody he sang when he came out of the water was the one he had searched for over and over again two years ago but could not find.

When the musician Wagner had completed the "Rhinegold" trilogy, he still hadn't thought of its opening tune. He was on a ship at sea, unable to sleep day or night. One afternoon, he was so tired that he finally fell into a light sleep. He seemed to feel himself sinking in a rapid current, hearing the sound of rushing water surging back and forth, forming a melody of its own. After waking up, he composed the opening tune of the trilogy based on the sound of the rapid current he heard in his dream.

The English poet Coleridge's "Kubla Khan" is also a work from a dream. He was originally addicted to opium. One day, after getting drunk, he sat in a chair and fell asleep. Before going to sleep, he read in a travelogue the sentence "Kubla Khan ordered the construction of a palace here, and built a magnificent garden, so a wall enclosed ten miles of fertile land." In three quarters of an hour of deep sleep, he dreamed of making two or three hundred lines of poetry based on this story. When he first woke up, he still remembered it clearly, so he took paper and pen to write it down quickly. When he wrote dozens of lines, a guest suddenly came to visit, interrupting his train of thought. After the guest left, what he saw in his dream became blurred and vague, and he could not continue writing. The fifty-three lines he wrote down are one of the three masterpieces in his complete works.

### A Record of Touring the Stone House and Misty Clouds Caves

— Banmeng Old Man

There are no large caves in West Lake. Only the Zilai Cave on Jade Emperor Mountain is relatively deep and wide. Although the rest have names, they are mostly small in size. One day, I went down the mountain from Ziyun Cave, walked across the Kuahong Bridge, and visited the Quyuan Fenghe Pavilion. The outside of the pavilion used to be called Yue Lake, but there are very few lotus flowers planted, and there is no Quyuan by the lake. It can be said that the name does not match the reality. After crossing the bridge, I went south. Along the way, I passed Dongpu Wangshan Yatidi Suolan Yingbi Five Bridges, combined with Kuahong as Six Bridges. The scenery on the embankment is excellent. Except for the passing cars and rickshaws, there are very few tourists. There are stone steps on the embankment to sit on. Sitting quietly in the weeping willows and gentle breeze, all the mundane troubles are washed away, making one reluctant to leave.

After Su Causeway, there is the Nanling Pavilion. Sitting on the stone railing, I asked a fellow resting person about the location of the Stone House Cave. According to the answer, I had to take the car road to Chishanbu to enter the mountain. So I took the car road and passed the Siyan Jing Pavilion, turned northwest, and arrived at Daren Temple. Behind the temple is the Stone House Cave. The houses are brand new. Outside the temple gate is the Stone House Pavilion. Inside the cave, on the left is the Stone Courtyard, a small cave. On the right is a small cave, wide at the mouth and narrow at the bottom, like a conch shell, inscribed with the words "Canghai Fuluo" (Floating Conch in the Sea). The conch is similar, but the words "Canghai" (Sea) have not yet been settled. The Wengyun Cave is wonderful. Above the Stone House Cave, there is still the Qiankun Cave, which cannot become a cave. The words Qiankun (Universe) are even more absurd. The Buddha statues in the Stone House Cave are very well sculpted and worth a look.

After leaving Daren Temple, turning right and heading west, it is Manjuelong. There are only three or five villages here, famous for osmanthus flowers. There is Upper Manjuelong and Lower Manjuelong, but the mountain is very compact. The house on the top of Nan Gao Peak is clearly visible. Walking along the road to a short wall surrounded area, entering the door, it is the Shuile Cave. The shape of the Shuile Cave is also like a conch, the deeper the narrower. A monk hangs a sign to raise money, using a lantern to lure people into the cave, but going to the bottom of the cave, there is nothing else to see. The water in the Shuile Cave is very clear and drinkable. In the past, when I visited the Shuile Cave, I heard the sound of gurgling water on all sides, but now there is none, because it hasn't rained for a long time.

Yongle Cave is nothing to see. Exiting the door, climbing Gao Peak, there is a pavilion midway called Banting (Half Pavilion). After resting for a while, going up again, we arrived at Yanxia Cave. The walls of Yanxia Cave are carved with Arhat statues, a total of eighteen, plus the Great Buddha, Maitreya, Guanyin, and other statues. The Arhat statues are exquisitely carved, each with an attitude. There is a stele at the entrance of the cave, inscribed with the five characters "Yanxia Cidi Duo" (Misty Clouds Abound Here). To the right of the cave is the Su Lao Stone Altar, with strange and ancient architecture. Looking from afar on the flat ground outside the cave, the mountains are high and low, making the chest feel open and refreshed.

Next to the cave is Yanxia Temple, which is said to have excellent vegetarian dishes, the best of the mountain temples. When I came, the temple was already dilapidated. Entering the temple and looking around, I didn't see a single monk, but there was a young woman sitting doing housework, not even entertaining tourists, perhaps a member of the monks' family. (Editor's note: The four characters "sengzhong juanshu" (monks' family members) seem quite novel.) At that time, I didn't see anyone else visiting the cave except me, it was quiet and lonely. Outside the cave, there was only a photographer, displaying his price list advertising board, waiting for tourists. The so-called Woshi Xijiang Zhiji Zhu Ting (reclining lion sucking the river), were not seen. Below, there was an old woman setting up a cloth awning to sell tea, the tea tasted clear and delicious. From this, we can imagine the desolation after the disaster.

Yanxia Cave is located in a very good place, and should be the crown of all the caves in West Lake, but now Yanxia Temple has no proper monks to manage it, and the scenic spot is becoming increasingly desolate, which is regrettable. I composed a verse on the spot: "The stone is condensed and unique, the misty clouds are ancient and evoke my thoughts, for no reason, my chest is full of hills, and I pluck the old vines and pick the purple zhi." Going west from the cave, you can reach Longjing, but it was already late, so the tour of Longjing can only wait for another day.

### "Hiding the Six"

— Miao Zibin

Yesterday I read Old Man Banmeng's A Tour of Lingyin, saying that there is a stone cave under the Release Pond called Cangliu (藏六) Cave. I do not understand the meaning of the two characters "Cangliu". According to the Agama Sutra, "There is a turtle wrapped by a wild jackal (the name of an animal). The turtle hides the six and does not come out. The jackal is angry and abandons it. The Buddha told the bhikkhus that they should hide the six roots like a turtle, so that the demon cannot take advantage." The turtle can shrink its head, tail, and four feet, so it is called hiding the six. The meaning of Lingyin Cangliu Cave should be based on this. Su Shi's poem on the Jiaoao Pavilion has a line saying, "Gaining is like a tiger holding a target, losing is like a turtle hiding the six." Qing Yao Xibao also has a line saying, "This body has not yet become a turtle hiding the six, bustling in the human world in the same situation," both of which are used to mean escaping from the world. Today, people often scold others by saying "six shrinks," using the turtle as a metaphor. In fact, the ancients did not avoid turtles. There were many people who used the character "turtle" as a name, and there were even more who used the turtle to describe people.

### Morning Dew

— Y

A life without love is like a tree without flowers; even if it is immortal, it is in vain.

A spark, even if it is a momentary light, after all, overcomes the darkness.

There are three types of people in the world: those who play with love, those who do not know love, and those who are immersed in love—God knows who is the happiest!

Those who vent their resentment with abuse, ridicule, and curses are mediocre people, and those who deal with hatred with hatred are warriors. But it takes even greater courage to repay hatred with love.

### Remembering Huang Moses

— Qian Dacheng

When Zhang Taiyan lectured at Soochow University, he was closest to Huang Moses of Changshu, and the two often talked until dawn. Moses died of illness, and his son killed someone and hid in Taiyan's place. Taiyan provided him with protection in every way, caring for the son of his old friend to the utmost. The world then knew that Moses was also no ordinary person.

Moses's original name was Zhensheng, and later he wanted a famous name, Muzhi, Moses was his other name. His father lived in seclusion as a merchant, but he loved the teachings of Laozi and Zhuangzi, and wrote a volume of Taoist sayings. Moses's articles were thousands of words long, and his extraordinary spirit overflowed from the paper. He did not care about trivial matters. During the day, he rode horses as a playboy, and read books at night. Sometimes he would not sleep for a month, or he would write dozens of poems in one night. When he was a professor at Soochow University, he compiled a history of Chinese literature in twenty-nine volumes, the size of which was unmatched in the world, and it was stored in the university library. It is not known whether it was scattered during the chaos. He was especially good at writing lyrics, and he harmonized with all the works of Gong Dingzhen, Zhang Gaowen, and Jiang Jianren. Yan Gu Old Man wrote a preface and published it, saying: "Its mystery is like a child, its resentment is like the Sorrow, its emptiness is like Zen, its etherealness is like a ghost, its seductiveness is like a simple woman, speaking unspeakable words, expressing unattainable meanings, entrusting unentrustable emotions, like a spiderweb floating in the long sky, not knowing where it dwells, but also dwelling everywhere." He also said: "Huang Zi Moses is learned but stingy. His lyrics, why do they make me so sad, so thoughtful, as if I see the quiet Huang Zi with his short hair fluttering on his back, reciting in a low voice in the dim lamp and curved screen. ..." Moses relied on the tune Phoenix Perching on Wutong to write his own anthology of lyrics, saying: "An inch of heart is the home of ten thousand ages of emotional demons, accumulated tears are like a river, accumulated hatred is like mountains piled up; may the beautiful women be transformed into the moon, and the mountains and rivers leave shadows without birth or death. The moon falls to the west, and it is always a waste to search for it. Hou Yi is always poor, and he is ashamed to receive Chunhu's memories; flying up to the blue sky without strength, the colorful food is thrown straight into the rainbow." In his later years, he searched for more than two hundred lyricists from the Song and Yuan Dynasties who were good at writing lyrics but not famous, wanting to carve them to pass them down to the world, but he became ill and crazy for several months, tearing up almost all of his treasured books. Wu Jiang Jin Songcen called Moses's legends and Yisheng comparable to Wu Mei; the two were also good friends. Moses could not delve into the intricacies of the rules, but his abundant and leisurely state often surpassed Wu Mei. After Mei passed away, he was hailed as a master of lyric and musical learning, but Moses's name and reputation were both gone, and few people in the world knew about him. Mr. Jin Shuyuan worked with Moses for three years and often advised him to write, but Moses sighed and said: "I am at the end of my rope, unable to do anything!" In his heart, he had unspeakable pain, and he did not want to indulge in the sea of trivial writing in order to seek a small name after his death. Jin Songcen listed Moses in the biographies of the Five Eccentrics of Suzhou, saying that Moses was talented but suspicious. Some say that his person is strange, his writing is strange, and his death is also strange, nothing is not strange, so his encounters are also strange.

### 

The summer vacation is over, and there are many graduates from various universities. How to continue "studies" and have a "career" has become a very serious problem. The misery of "graduation is unemployment" has been called for for many years, not starting from today, but now it is even more difficult because the destruction of transportation is becoming more and more blocked, and the destruction or abandonment of construction has occurred in various places. The situation in important areas has changed. For example, it was often heard that people went to the Northeast to work in the past two summers, but this year, only people from the Northeast are seen moving to the interior, one after another. From this, we can imagine the situation in various places, and after slightly examining the phenomenon that destruction is greater than construction, we know that after leaving school, we cannot help but feel the vastness of the road ahead.

University students should, in principle, aim at academics. The so-called "learning for the sake of learning" is the true essence of the highest institution, which is different from the creation of practical talents in vocational schools, especially those who "study for the sake of career" in vocational schools. This principle has been greatly clarified to the world since the "May Fourth Movement" and the development of the new culture, and after the reform of the school system. Therefore, graduating from university and being eager to find a job seems inconsistent with the university's standpoint. But the fact is that livelihood is pressing, and we still cannot fully comply with the original intention. The old saying "only when clothing and food are sufficient do people know honor and disgrace" still has a taste. Even if one is determined to research and has the ability to invent, it is impossible to serve the public on an empty stomach. Even if the national strength can support university graduate students, it is difficult to cover the majority of graduates from various schools. Therefore, the close connection between career and study is inevitable and reasonable. Over the years, before each graduation, regardless of whether it is a university or a vocational school, the registration office in the school will prepare a roster, and the document office will prepare a draft of recommendations, inquiring with relevant professional or technical application agencies for recommendations, so that they can have a place to settle down as soon as they leave school. On average, industry needs materials most urgently, and it is easier to place those who study engineering. As long as the situation is stable and order is normal in other departments, there will not be a complete lack of placement, only the difference between more or less, sooner or later, but now it is difficult to say.
