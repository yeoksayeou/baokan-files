General MacArthur will arrive by plane from Tokyo on the same day and return to Japan by the same plane after the ceremony. In his reply to Rhee, MacArthur stated: "My wife and I are delighted to be invited to visit Korea and are deeply honored to witness the great event of your country's free birth. This grand occasion will surely resonate with joy in the hearts of every American. This ceremony also serves as a demonstration of the great success of your decades of unyielding struggle. Please accept my sincerest congratulations."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] The United States has de facto recognized the South Korean government today and appointed John J. Muccio as the Special Representative with the rank of Ambassador stationed in Seoul. The State Department's statement said: The Korean government in Seoul was formed in accordance with the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on November 14, 1947, and should therefore be recognized as the government of Korea. It is hoped that the Korean people north of the 38th parallel will be able to freely participate in this government at an appropriate time. State Department officials declined to comment on reports from Nanjing that the Chinese authorities have provisionally recognized the Seoul government, stating that the United States has informed the eight countries in the UN delegation to Korea of this action: China, Australia, the Philippines, Syria, India, Canada, France, El Salvador, and the United Kingdom, a signatory to the Cairo Declaration. The United States has also informed the head of the UN delegation to Korea, who is currently in Seoul, of this move. The Ukrainian representative, who was originally nominated as a member of the delegation to Korea but refused to go, has not been notified. The State Department spokesman continued: John J. Muccio is a career diplomat who has worked in the US consulates in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Fuzhou, and Kunming for more than eight years. Mr. Muccio is currently on the West Coast of the United States and will soon depart for Seoul. (The full text of the US State Department statement is published on page 3)

[United Press, Washington, 12th] Government officials predicted on the 12th that US troops will continue to be stationed in South Korea until the new South Korean government believes it is strong enough to resist any communist coup attempts. The Soviet Union still occupies North Korea. Officials stated that the policy of withdrawing US occupation forces from Korea will be decided in negotiations with South Korean President Syngman Rhee. The US government formally recognized this government as the "Government of Korea" on the evening of the 12th. However, a rival "leftist" government is about to be elected in North Korea this month, which means that there will be a Soviet-recognized North Korean government and a US-recognized South Korean government in Korea. Both governments claim to speak for the Korean people. This troubled country, which gained liberation from Japanese rule only three years ago, will be presented at the United Nations General Assembly in Paris in mid-September this year. President Syngman Rhee said on the 12th that, given the current situation, he requests that US troops remain stationed in Korea indefinitely. However, just six months ago, Rhee was still demanding the immediate withdrawal of US occupation forces from Korea.

[Central News Agency, Seoul, 13th] The Cairo Declaration by China, Britain, and the United States stipulates that Korea be granted independence. China, one of the three countries, has provisionally recognized the South Korean government established on August 15. The Chinese note was delivered to President Syngman Rhee by Liu Yuwan, representative of the Chinese Ambassador to Korea, at 7:05 PM on the 13th. It is generally expected that the Philippines will follow China's lead and grant provisional recognition as well. President Rhee stated that he deeply appreciates President Chiang Kai-shek and Foreign Minister Wang's goodwill in supporting the new government of the Republic of Korea. For hundreds of years, China and Korea have not only been friendly with each other but have also been brotherly nations. Therefore, China and Korea, two Far Eastern countries, should support each other to promote peace and prosperity. Rhee also stated that he hopes China and Korea can help each other solve the communist problem.

### Chang Chun's Visit to Japan Seems Likely; Our Delegation to Japan Has Not Received Any News

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] Shang Zhen, head of our delegation to Japan, stated that he has not yet received any news from our government regarding the rumored visit of former Premier Chang Chun to Japan, but Chang's visit to Japan seems likely.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 12th] Political observers here commented on the recognition of the Seoul government by China, Britain, and the United States, saying that since the end of the war, the Chinese government has clearly stood on the side of the Western powers and resolutely made decisions on major issues in the Far East, which is equivalent to directly opposing the Soviet Union's point of view. This is a first. Sources said that Chang Chun will soon go to Korea and then to Japan, or even to Indonesia and Myanmar. Chang will meet with South Korean Prime Minister Lee Bum Suk in Korea, who will be inaugurated on the 15th of this month. General elections will be held in the Soviet-occupied area of North Korea on the 25th of this month. Chang will meet with leaders of major political parties in Japan, or may meet with General MacArthur and Emperor Hirohito. According to some sources, Chang's main goal in going to Japan is to arrange a meeting between General MacArthur and President Chiang Kai-shek. Chang's trip will last about a month, after which he may go to the United States to negotiate US aid to China with US government authorities. However, government sources claim that Chang does not have a formal mission.

### US Aid Joint Meeting; Cotton Yarn Exchange Rate Determined; Agreement Also Reached on the Use of Grain and Petroleum

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The US Aid Utilization Committee and the China Division of the US Economic Cooperation Administration held their third joint meeting at the Executive Yuan's No. 1 Official Residence at 3:00 PM on the 13th. Those attending from our side included members of the US Aid Utilization Committee Yu Hongjun, Yu Dawei, Wang Yunwu, Wang Shijie (represented by Dong Lin), Yan Jiagan, Li Gan, Shen Xirui, and Wu Xuelan. Those attending from the US side included Lapham, Gilpatrick, Cushman, and more than ten others. Our Minister of Food, Guan Jiyu, was also invited to participate. Premier Weng Wenhao presided over the meeting. In addition to reporting on recent business, the two sides agreed on the following three points regarding the use of US aid materials: (1) Regarding cotton, they expressed acceptance of the eight distribution principles decided by the cotton group (see below). Regarding the exchange ratio between cotton and cotton yarn, it was stipulated that each bale of cotton yarn would be exchanged for 599 pounds of cotton. The standard for cotton is 7/8-inch non-lint American cotton, and the standard for cotton yarn is 20-count export cotton yarn, limited to the first phase of US aid cotton. The US side hopes that the implementing agency must be jointly run by the China Division of the US Economic Cooperation Administration and the US Aid Utilization Committee. (2) Regarding grain, in addition to supplying the five major cities participating in rationing, it was also decided to supply Qingdao as much as possible due to the special circumstances in Qingdao and the blockage of nearby grain sources. (3) Regarding petroleum, it was decided to supply public utilities, and the price will be determined by personnel designated by the US Aid Utilization Committee and the China Division of the US Economic Cooperation Administration. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.

The eight cotton distribution principles decided by the Cotton Group Meeting can be summarized as follows: (1) The distribution of US aid cotton is specifically for spinning 20-count or finer cotton yarn. (2) To the extent possible, raw cotton should be exchanged for cotton yarn or cotton cloth on the same basis. However, if the yarn factory does not have ready-made cotton yarn or cotton cloth, the distribution agency can still allocate cotton and then the factory will hand over the cotton yarn or cotton cloth within a certain period of time (i.e., the time required for manufacturing). (3) The allocation of US aid cotton is limited to yarn factories that do not have enough cotton to supply for two months. Each allocation shall not exceed the factory's needs for one month, but the remaining cotton in the factory shall not be counted. (4) Superior long-fiber cotton should be allocated to factories with tools to utilize it. The cotton yarn or cotton cloth spun from it, whether for domestic or foreign sales, must meet the standards set by the aid cotton distribution agency. (5) After a factory accepts the allocation of US aid cotton, it should immediately be made into cotton yarn or cloth, and the allocated cotton must not be sold. (6) All aid cotton allocations will be picked up from warehouses in the port of entry, and the exchanged yarn or cloth should also be carried out in the same seaport warehouse. (7) The total amount allocated to each factory is determined by the ratio of the factory's spindles at the time of commissioning and all spindles spinning American cotton. (8) When applying for the allocation of cotton, each factory can apply in writing to the Cotton Group.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The issue of the use of funds after the sale of US aid materials was not raised for discussion at the joint meeting on the afternoon of the 13th. It will be discussed after accurate statistics are available. However, off-site exchanges of opinions are still in progress.

### Buckwheat Airlifted to Shenyang

US Aid Wheat Continues to Arrive in Tianjin

### Finance Ministry Forbids the Establishment of New Banks and Brokers in More Than 20 Cities and Ports Such as Beijing and Shanghai; The Capital Amount for Permitted Establishment Areas to be Increased

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] In order to control credit and regulate finance to achieve the purpose of stabilizing the economy, the Ministry of Finance has decided to impose strict restrictions on the establishment of banks and brokers in the future, in addition to rectifying financial institutions and inspecting banks and brokers. The opinions of the key members of the Ministry of Finance who went to Japan for discussions are completely consistent on the issue of restricting the establishment of new banks and brokers in the future. They all advocate that in fact, no new banks and brokers should be established from today. However, the method is to restrict the establishment area and increase the capital amount. Based on this important principle, the specific methods and implementation details are also being studied and will be finalized soon and submitted to the Political Affairs Meeting for discussion and approval for implementation. The content of the measures will include two major points. One is to restrict the area of establishment, stipulating that except for the inland and remote provinces and cities, the establishment of new banks and brokers is absolutely prohibited in all major cities and commercial ports across the country. The other is to increase the capital amount for the establishment of new banks and brokers. Those who establish new banks and brokers in inland and remote provinces and cities should reach the standard of the pre-war capital amount. According to the new regulations, new banks and brokers are not allowed to be established in any circumstances in more than 20 major cities and commercial ports across the country, such as Shanghai, Beijing, Pingjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Jinan, Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Xunyang, and Changsha, Xi'an, Nanchang, Wenzhou, Suzhou, Shenyang, etc. As for other provinces, the inland and remote provinces are allowed to establish banks and brokers, and the method of increasing the capital amount is based on the capital amount of the pre-war banks and brokers as the base, and then calculate the highest base of the bank in legal tender according to the current living index of public education employees in the Beijing-Shanghai area, which is 500,000 yuan, followed by 200,000 yuan, and the lowest base of the bank is 50,000 yuan. The living index is based on the living index of the current month at the time of establishment. For example, the living index in the Beijing-Shanghai area in July is 1.6 million times, then the bank with a base of 500,000 yuan must have a capital amount of 800 billion yuan to be allowed to establish, and the commercial bank's attached industry department and savings and credit department should increase its capital amount by one-half for each attached department compared to the original capital amount. It is reported that this restriction on the establishment of new banks and brokers and the increase in the capital amount of banks and brokers were proposed by the Ministry of Finance in the past and submitted to the Political Affairs Meeting for discussion. Later, it was handed over to the National Economic Committee for review, but it was shelved due to the end of the National Economic Committee until now. Recently, the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly requested instructions from the Executive Yuan. A few days ago, the Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Finance to formulate new measures as soon as possible. After receiving the order, the Ministry of Finance gathered several key members to study in detail. After determining the above principles, it is formulating specific measures based on these principles. After the plan is finalized, it can be submitted to the Political Affairs Meeting for discussion. In the midst of the rectification of banks and brokers, the heads of the Ministry of Finance are determined to strictly restrict the establishment of new banks and brokers.

### Tuition Fees, Teachers' Livelihoods, and the Education System

The Shanghai educational authorities have invited dozens of principals, faculty representatives, parents, and prominent figures in the education community from both public and private schools to hold a symposium today. Each will express their opinions from their own perspectives on the issue of tuition standards for the next semester. Although no resolutions will be made, this can serve as a reference for the educational authorities in determining the fee standards for the next semester.

The summer vacation is fleeting, and the first semester of the 37th year is about to begin. The issue of tuition fees for public and private schools is not only a concern for parents with children attending school, but also for all those who care about the education of the next generation. Everyone hopes that the educational authorities can set a relatively reasonable standard. We would like to take this opportunity to express our views on this issue as the symposium is being held.

In today's world of rampant and endless inflation, except for a few wealthy families, the vast majority of families in Shanghai are feeling the pressure of high prices and threatened livelihoods. They simply cannot afford their children's education. Hearing that the tuition fees for the next semester will be based on the price of rice, parents are panicking and worrying about their children's tuition fees when school starts next semester, some even to the point of insomnia. Starting school seems like a difficult hurdle for these parents. The closer the start of school gets, the more their frowns deepen. As for the majority of students, they not only feel uneasy because of their parents' worries, but also panic because they may have to drop out of school. Therefore, from the perspective of students and parents, they naturally advocate for the tuition standards to be set as low as possible, and even oppose the schools' method of collecting "one unit of rice" as tuition. However, turning around and looking at the difficult lives of the general faculty members, it is inevitable to feel that this argument is not entirely fair.

Teachers are the nannies who cultivate the talents of the next generation. They not only make supreme contributions to the nation and country, but also serve as role models for the current society. In theory, everyone should respect the position of teachers, and teachers themselves naturally regard it as a sacred career. However, the poverty of teachers' lives in our country has always been the case, and it is even worse today. Although the country has long had plans to improve teachers' salaries, things have not gone as desired. Teachers' salaries have not only not improved, but have instead deteriorated. Today, some teachers' monthly income cannot even support their own lives, let alone support their families. How can we expect teachers to educate the next generation of citizens with peace of mind in such a life? The last semester has passed, and the teachers' salaries must be improved in the next semester. This is a matter of course, and no one can oppose it. The source of funds for private schools usually comes from tuition fees. The board of directors usually does not bear any responsibility, so from the perspective of teachers, one has to sympathize with the schools' request to raise tuition standards.

Taking care of the burden on parents means not taking care of the teachers' livelihoods, and vice versa. This contradictory phenomenon would not be difficult to solve if the country were at peace. As long as the country establishes more schools, especially primary and secondary schools, and subsidizes private schools more, it can take care of both the burden on parents and the lives of teachers. However, today, we happen to be in a time of national crisis. Whether it is the central or local government, finances and economies are extremely difficult. Apart from basic education, it is impossible for the government to take on the entire responsibility of educating the next generation of youth. Therefore, the issue of school fees has become a major problem today. Parents, students, principals, teachers, and the country and society are all troubled and anxious about this issue. But how should this problem be solved in a reasonable way? We believe that as long as the four parties—the state, society, parents, and schools—can cooperate, and they can recognize that there should be flexible solutions in times of crisis, it will not be difficult to find a reasonable solution. Let us first propose some methods for the reference of those who are enthusiastic about education.

First, the finances of every school, whether public or private, should be absolutely transparent, and expenditures should be based on income. Teachers' salaries and administrative expenses should be in a fixed proportion, preferably a ratio of 8:2 or 7:3. Under this method, students can pay the lowest tuition fees, and teachers can receive the highest salaries. In the past, in some schools, because the finances were not transparent, teachers' salaries were not necessarily increased in proportion to the tuition fees. In other words, the burden on parents was increased, but the teachers' salaries were not increased. All tuition income may have only filled the pockets of a few principals. Such people are truly the scum of the Shanghai education community and the shame of the Shanghai cultural community. Therefore, we hope that the educational authorities can strengthen the supervision of the finances of private schools and ensure that they are transparent. All tuition income, except for administrative expenses, should be shared by all teachers. In any case, principals must never be allowed to exploit teachers again in the future. At the same time, we hope that teachers will come forward with solid evidence to report principals who do not have transparent finances, so that the proper proportion of tuition income can be used as teachers' salaries.

Second, the educational authorities should, to the extent possible, strive for the percentage of cultural and educational funding that should be obtained in the budget, as stipulated by the Constitution. Within the limits of the necessary funding, the spirit of "collecting every drop for public use" should be used to add more public schools and recruit as many poor students as possible. Also, private schools with outstanding achievements should be given more subsidies to be used for adding equipment. By no means should the only way to maintain schools be to simply allow them to raise tuition fees, causing countless outstanding poor students to be discouraged.

Third, the society should also universally launch a student aid movement to rescue out-of-school youth and establish scholarships and bursaries in various schools. For example, the "Reader Student Aid Movement" launched by this newspaper has been going on for a long time, and the amount of student aid obtained seems to be considerable. This shows that there are quite a few people in the society who recognize that "helping students is the greatest joy." We hope that all sectors of society can, in the spirit of "loving the young as we love our own," launch a student aid movement, so that no matter how expensive tuition fees are, outstanding young people can be prevented from dropping out of school due to lack of funds.

Fourth, we believe that China is a poor country, and it is in a very poor period. In order to save the education crisis, we must quickly consider changing the education system, and in particular, we should adopt entrance examinations for schools at all levels that rely solely on the knowledge and skills of the candidates, and not on school diplomas. At the same time, we should encourage the establishment of various cram schools, public libraries, laboratories, sports grounds, and various broadcast schools, and promote electrical education as much as possible, in order to open up a convenient avenue for self-study for those who cannot afford tuition fees but are truly eager to learn. Only in this way can we see many outstanding poor students be able to seek their knowledge, train their bodies, and have the same academic abilities as those who attend classes in regular schools, whether at home, by the radio, in the library, in the laboratory, or on the sports field. Since the recruitment of new students by schools at all levels is based on academic ability, they will naturally be able to select real talents, which will not hinder the progress of education. Perhaps only by promoting such methods can we rescue a large number of out-of-school youth!

### Sleeping Sickness Found in Tianjin; Four Deaths Already

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 13th] Qu Hongjun, director of the Tianjin Infectious Diseases Hospital, said that several patients with "sleeping sickness" have recently been discovered in Tianjin. Among them, four people have died. Qu said that sleeping sickness is encephalitis, and some patients do not have sleeping phenomena. In the past, it was believed that the transmission of this disease was due to breathing, but it has recently been discovered that mosquitoes are the main vector of transmission. However, it cannot be proven that breathing does not transmit the disease. This disease has two types, A and B. Type B is prevalent in Japan and the United States. According to clinical tests, most of the cases in China belong to Type B of Japan. According to the research of Yan Chunhui, professor of bacteriology at Peking Union Medical College, this disease was not found in China before Japan's large-scale invasion of China on July 7th.

### Air Force Commander-in-Chief Zhou Zhirou Writes Article to Encourage All Soldiers to Risk Their Lives to Complete the Victory in Suppressing the Rebellion

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] For the "August 14th" Air Force Day, Air Force Commander-in-Chief Zhou Zhirou specially wrote an article entitled "Air Force Commemorated on August 14th" to commemorate the occasion and encourage all Air Force soldiers. After analyzing the current situation in more than 2,000 words, the conclusion stated: The military campaign to suppress the rebellion will surely be victorious. Of course, from now until the day the Communist bandits are wiped out, there is still a difficult journey ahead. The ancients said, "He who walks a hundred li is halfway at ninety," which means that the closer one gets to the goal, the more difficult it becomes. Therefore, the Air Force's mission in the future will become more important and more arduous. In order to accomplish this mission, we would like to put forward three simple points to encourage all our compatriots: First, Air Force soldiers not only have advanced technical training, but also have great ambitions and a sincere desire to serve the country, serve the leader, and seek the glorious survival of the Chinese nation. Therefore, we must have the determination to risk our lives and achieve this mission of suppressing the rebellion. Second, mutual love and sincerity are the school motto of everyone's training period, and it is also the motto for the comrades of our army to get along with each other. In the difficult environment in the future, we must love each other more, unite without gaps, and make the entire Air Force a strong body that advances without retreat, wins without defeat, and exerts maximum combat power. Third, even though we are at war, we should continue to make progress in order to lay the foundation for future military building. Training cannot be stopped for a day, and other departments such as manufacturing, repair, supply, and all departments must also have long-term plans.

### One of Our Customs Patrol Boats: British Captain Embezzles and Flees; Six Sailors Under Close Surveillance

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 12th] The truth behind the embezzlement case of the British captain of one of our country's patrol boats has now come to light. The British captain may be extradited to our side to stand trial, as the crime occurred within our country's territorial waters. According to reports, the captain, named Sailteville, was leading six Chinese sailors on patrol near Da Chan Island. At the end of last month, when the boat returned to port to replenish supplies, it encountered a civilian boat carrying contraband. The captain not only failed to detain the boat and hand it over to customs authorities, but also demanded a bribe of 4,000 Hong Kong dollars. When the civilian boat stated that it did not have that much money, Sailteville detained two people as hostages. Later, he released the civilian boat, stipulating that the two hostages would pay the full amount of the bribe upon arrival in port. As the patrol boat approached Qingshan, one of the hostages suddenly broke free and went ashore, reporting to the police. Upon hearing this, Sailteville released the other hostage en route. After the boat returned to Da Chan Island and replenished supplies, the sailors on board were placed under close surveillance. After Sailteville suddenly disappeared, the Chinese sailors on the boat were arrested and are now awaiting disposition in Bao'an County. How our authorities will handle this case is currently unknown.

They originally lived in Yan Xishan's mansion and had told reporters that the authorities were indifferent to them. Zhongnanhai was scheduled to open on the 15th, and various parts of the Pacification Headquarters had not yet finished closing.

### Chen Xueping Flies to Beiping; Carries Concrete Measures from the Central Government to Resolve the 7/5 Incident; Visits Fu Zuoyi and Hu Shi to Seek Opinions

Chen's actions were confidential, and few outside know his residence. It is said that the measures contain three points, but the details are not known. However, according to well-informed sources, a certain garrison authority that the people of the Northeast are demanding to be replaced may receive a demerit. The commander at the scene also bears no great responsibility. It is said that the Beiping Senate authorities also bear no responsibility in the 7/5 investigation report. However, the impassioned emotions of the people of the Northeast must be satisfied to a considerable extent. Chen will return to Nanjing with Qin Decun in a day or two so that the handling orders can be issued before August 19.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 13th] Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi visited Vice Minister Qin Decun at ten o'clock on the morning of the 13th for a long talk.

(2) Before the pricing formula is revised, the 1st and 16th of each month will be the adjustment dates for the time being. For public utilities, etc., whose prices must be adjusted once a month, quotas can be pre-purchased in the form of fixed coal. (3) When transportation is obstructed or the transport volume is insufficient, each mine shall be responsible for adjustment and give priority to public utilities and railways. (4) The coal produced should be fully transported out as much as possible, and the remaining balance should be gradually stored in important areas to the specified storage amount before the allocation quota can be expanded.

### Results of Several Meetings at the Kremlin: The Berlin Stalemate Has Not Been Resolved; Soviet Military Police Once Invaded British and American Occupation Zones

[United Press, Moscow, 12th] The special envoys of the United States, Britain, and France talked with Molotov about the German issue for three hours tonight. The members are looking for a plan to reconcile the different opinions between the East and West on the German issue. US Ambassador Smith said, "We had a very pleasant talk." However, out of respect for the decision to maintain confidentiality, he refused to comment. After the meeting, the three special envoys gathered at the French ambassador's residence to jointly draft a report to their respective governments.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 12th] It is widely rumored that the talks in Moscow are unlikely to be fruitful, but political and diplomatic circles here have not confirmed this pessimistic news, and said that the talks are still in progress, so there is no reason to relax the hope of achieving good results. The authorities are still strictly keeping secrets about the situation in Moscow and refusing to comment.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 12th, United Press] Soviet military police, in collusion with German police in Germany, invaded the British and American zones of Berlin today under the pretext of searching for black market dealers. A rapid response team of Soviet military police and German police working for the Soviet Union broke into apartments in the British and American zones. The German police in the Western zone immediately telegraphed the British and American military police to come and assist in stopping them. At that time, the leader of a British patrol team led the team to come, and the team leader asked the Soviet soldiers to withdraw from the British and American zones, which the Soviet side accepted. By the time an American army team arrived, the Soviet soldiers had already left.

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 12th] A spokesman for the US military government said in a radio address today, "The current confidentiality of the Moscow talks does not mean that the great powers will resume secret diplomacy in the future. US Ambassador Smith at the Moscow talks has 140 million Americans behind him." He cited the results of a public opinion poll in the United States, saying that 80 percent of the American people believe that Western countries should stay in Berlin, even at the cost of war.

He also recalled the letters from President Roosevelt to Hitler in 1938 and 1939, which were regarded by Hitler as a sign of weakness," but "the tens of thousands of tanks, tens of thousands of airplanes, and atomic bombs produced by the United States every year have shown Hitler's miscalculations. The experience of history since 1938 has opened the eyes of the American people." He concluded, "The United States is now rushing to build airplanes that can be used by 70 air force teams, but every American hopes that these modern airplanes will not have to be used in the end."

### Mrs. Kasenkina Seriously Injured After Jumping From a Building

[United Press, New York, 12th] Mrs. Kasenkina, a Soviet elementary school teacher, fell from a fourth-floor window of the Soviet Consulate here a few minutes after hearing a radio broadcast saying that the Soviet Consul General in New York, Lomakin, had refused to hand her over to the court to explain whether she had been forcibly detained. Mrs. Kasenkina has now been sent to Roosevelt Hospital. According to the nurse, Mrs. Kasenkina has a fractured right leg and internal injuries, and her condition is critical. Deputy Police Commissioner Lawson Gast said that he had interrogated consulate staff for a long time but could not determine whether Mrs. Kasenkina had fallen or jumped. Lawson also said that he was investigating the possibility that Mrs. Kasenkina might have been pushed. Soviet personnel said that Mrs. Kasenkina was extremely annoyed by the remarks in the broadcast.

Miss Tolstoy, the head of the Tolstoy Foundation, an anti-communist White Russian refugee organization, said that she believed that Mrs. Kasenkina had no intention of committing suicide. "She never talked about suicide. I think this was an attempt to escape desperately."

[US News Service, New York, 12th] The New York Police Department, which had previously been unable to meet with Mrs. Kasenkina at the consulate, stated after questioning her tonight that Mrs. Kasenkina seemed to have deliberately jumped out of the consulate window. Due to her health, it is currently inconvenient to question her further.

[United Press, New York, 12th] After two hours of treatment by doctors and others, Deputy Police Inspector Mullins was allowed to talk to Mrs. Kasenkina through an interpreter. Mullins asked if she had jumped down herself, and Mrs. Kasenkina replied, "Yes." When asked why, Mrs. Kasenkina closed her eyes and breathed heavily and rapidly. The doctor immediately waved to stop Mullins from asking questions and to ask again when she was stronger.

She said, "I'm afraid of them. I don't want to see anyone from the Soviet consulate." Mrs. Kasenkina told Deputy Detective Mullins, "I'm afraid to see them. I'm afraid of them, so I don't want to see them." But Soviet Deputy Consul General Ghibonik, after being turned away by the police three times, still said that he would continue to try until he was allowed to meet with her. Mrs. Kasenkina is now quietly resting in Roosevelt Hospital, under heavy police protection, to prevent any attempts that may endanger her life. Her condition is said to be "dangerous but not fatal." Belyakov, a White Russian who helped Mrs. Kasenkina escape to the Tolstoy Foundation, visited her in the hospital. According to him, Mrs. Kasenkina told him, "I'm like a bird in a cage. I must fly out. I must try to break out of the cage."

### Truman Deeply Dissatisfied With Lack of Accomplishments From Special Session of Congress; Republicans Cannot Escape Blame for Rising Prices

He said that the abundant harvest of grain this year can alleviate the burden on consumers, but it will take a long time.

### US Suggests Expanding the Danube Committee; Soviet Bloc Expresses Opposition; Vyshinsky Vigorously Criticizes the Marshall Plan

[United Press, Belgrade, 12th] Western countries tried on the 12th to overturn the Soviet plan to restrict the new Danube River Committee to the Soviet Union and its six riparian states, but it was clearly just another ineffective gesture. The United States suggested expanding the committee to include the United States, Britain, France, and Austria. Germany can also participate after the peace treaty is signed. The vice chairman of the US delegation also stated that if Austria and Germany become members of the committee, there will be appropriate provisions for the representation of countries that do not participate in the committee, and the United States is willing to give up its membership. The representatives of South Korea condemned Britain and the United States for attempting to invade the Danube River region with economic power.

[Agence France-Presse, Belgrade, 12th] Soviet representative Vyshinsky today criticized the Western countries' policy towards the Danube River and opposed the US proposal for Germany to participate in the Danube River Committee, strongly arguing that Germany's participation can only be decided by the Foreign Ministers' Conference in accordance with the Potsdam Resolution. He pointed out that Austria's participation can be accepted after the Austrian peace treaty is signed. Vyshinsky also replied to the British representative's question, saying that not only is Ukraine a Danube River country, but a small part of the Soviet Union's territory is also on the Danube River. However, no matter how you look at any map, you will not find that British land is connected to the Danube River. He also took the opportunity to attack the Marshall Plan as "American economic dictatorship."

### US Recognizes New Korean Government – Full Text of Announcement

[From the US News Agency, Washington, 12th] The full text of the United States' provisional recognition of the new Korean government is as follows: "In the joint declaration issued in Cairo on December 1, 1943, the signatory nations, namely the United States, China, and the United Kingdom, expressed their determination that 'in due course Korea shall become free and independent.' This determination was reaffirmed in the Potsdam Declaration of July 26, 1945, which the Soviet Union also joined after declaring war on Japan on August 8 of the same year. On December 27, 1945, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom signed an agreement stipulating the reconstruction of Korea as an independent state, which the Chinese government subsequently joined and pledged to uphold. Although Japan's annexation of Korea was completely terminated by the occupation of the country by the armed forces of the Soviet Union and the United States in August and September 1945, the freedom and independence of Korea, solemnly guaranteed by the four powers, has proven to be very slow in realization. After nearly two years of arduous efforts by the United States government to implement these guarantees through negotiations with other occupying powers proved futile, the Korean independence issue was brought before the United Nations General Assembly on September 17, 1947. The will of the vast majority of countries in the General Assembly was expressed in two resolutions adopted on November 14, 1947, the purpose of which was to make possible the long-sought freedom and independence of the Korean people through the holding of free elections and the establishment of a national government. To implement these resolutions, a temporary commission for Korea was established to supervise the election of representatives to a National Assembly, which would then establish a national government. The National Assembly, elected at that time, convened on May 31 and has begun to organize a government. It is also hoped that the people of North Korea, although unable to participate in the elections of May 10 due to the Soviet Union's refusal to allow the implementation of the General Assembly resolutions in its occupied zone, will eventually be able to assume their rightful place in this government through appropriate processes. Notification of the establishment of the new government was sent to the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea on August 6, 1948. "The US government believes that the new Korean government, produced in this way, should be regarded as the government of Korea as anticipated by the General Assembly resolution of November 14, 1947. Pending the consideration by the General Assembly at its future third session of the report of the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea, the United States, in accordance with its responsibilities as an occupying power, will appoint a special representative to Seoul to negotiate with the Korean government and the United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea regarding the implementation of the provisions of Section 4 of the Second Resolution of November 14, 1947. The President has appointed Mr. Macano of Rhode Island as the aforementioned special representative, who will hold the rank of ambassador."

### Expansion of Burmese Rebellion – Situation Increasingly Serious

### Stalin's Successor: Still the Biggest Secret

— By Middleton

The fact that Joseph Stalin, the son of a cobbler from Gori, is 68 years old this year is the most important political fact in the Soviet Union. Every year, during his long vacations in Sochi on the Black Sea, rumors of the leader's cancer always resurface, and the succession issue becomes more serious month by month. The most powerful ruler in the world is the head of this totalitarian state. The overall political system he prides himself on is top-down. The succession issue may cause the unity to break.

Moscow believes that Stalin has prepared a successor. This is a secret within a secret in this secretive country. Because if the name of the successor is made public, it may develop into a split in the government. Either a split between Stalin and the successor, weakening the former's power, or a conflict between Stalin and his successor and others who have the right to obtain this position.

The test of the highest power in the Soviet state depends on whether the ruthless, capable, and intelligent figures under Stalin who are qualified to succeed can obey his choice after Stalin's death. Historical precedents show that designating a successor is often the most powerful means of inciting power struggles.

Four Successors

There are four people who are the most suitable successors. The most well-known is Molotov, who has been the Minister of Foreign Affairs since 1939 to the present, and is 57 years old this year. He served as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars for eleven years. In the future struggle for the leadership succession, Molotov is the representative of the government. He is the manager of the government and bureaucracy. He is more prominent in the Politburo than any other figure. He knows how to operate the intricate machine of bureaucratic and governmental agencies. This is very important in a country that lacks technical and defense personnel in government and industry.

Molotov has two other advantages. He is more experienced than any other top government figure. He cooperated with Lenin and Stalin during the 1917 revolution, which is of great historical significance.

Zhdanov has the image of a rising sun. He is in charge of the organizational work of the Comintern, responsible for issuing communist theory and directives for the activities of foreign parties, is 51 years old this year, and is a Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party and a member of the Politburo.

Zhdanov's strength reflects the strength of the Party. The military weakened the Party's position during the war. Since the end of the war, the Communist Party's membership has increased to five million, regaining its former advantage.

Beria is a lesser-known figure around Stalin. He and Stalin are both Georgians, and he is 48 years old this year. His possible attainment of the position of successor is due to his scholarship and his knowledge of the security apparatus. He was recently nominated as Deputy Minister of State Security. As early as 1946, Beria left this position to engage in "special work." All of this has not been confirmed, but it is believed that Beria is responsible for organizing military and industrial research into atomic fission.

Beria is the Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Generally speaking, this position gives him the power to manage two or three important ministries. However, in his current position, his receipt of this title may give him the right to control all ministries closely related to his work.

Marshal Bulganin has become the most promising successor since the end of the war. His appointment as Minister of the Army indicates that the Party's strength has surpassed the position of the military figures who gained dominance during the war. Marshal Bulganin, an alternate member of the Politburo, is the military's representative in the Bureau. His military department has no regular troops. He is not a military leader who rose from the Party to exclude dissidents. During the war, he held an important position in the cooperation of heavy industry, and before the war, he was the President of the National Bank.

In addition to these four, there are two others who, even if they do not have the qualifications to succeed, at least have friendship and contact with the leader.

One is Malenkov, a member of the Politburo who assists Zhdanov in organizing the Communist Party. The other is Kaganovich, who is responsible for major post-war work and recently engaged in the cleansing work in Ukraine. On December 19, 1947, he reassumed his old job as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and he and Malenkov are both members of the Politburo. (To be continued)

### New Proposal to Stop Attacks in Jerusalem – Israel Formally Rejects It; Bernadotte Says Arab League Has Indicated Acceptance

[From the United Press, Rome, 13th] United Nations Mediator for Palestine, Count Bernadotte, arrived here on the 13th en route back to Sweden and stated that he had suggested that the United Nations send 40 troops to Latrun to protect the water station, but it was not adopted. Now, there is no water to drink in Jerusalem. Count Bernadotte believes that the destruction of the water station was carried out by Arab irregular forces. Count Bernadotte stated on the 13th that the Israeli government had rejected the proposal for a ceasefire by both Arab and Jewish sides, starting at 2:00 PM Greenwich time on the 13th. Bernadotte said that the Israeli government's decision "places a heavy responsibility on the Jews." He said that the Arab side had already accepted his proposal.

### The Rich Are Panicked, Voluntarily Seeking Meetings with the Mayor – One Name May Be Announced the Day After Tomorrow – Only Over One Trillion Yuan in Cash Received to Date

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, a group of reporters from this city collectively visited Mayor Wu at his office to inquire about the progress of the special relief donation. Because the special donation has so far remained in the "only hear the sound of weaving upstairs" stage, the fundraising committee has repeatedly stated that it will publish the list of stingy wealthy individuals, but there has been no concrete indication of a "showdown." The reporters specifically asked Mayor Wu to reveal some information. According to the mayor, the name of one very wealthy person may be announced next Monday (the 16th). When reporters asked which industry the wealthy tycoon belonged to, he was temporarily unwilling to disclose it, only saying that the wealthy class in this city is now quite panicked, and a considerable number of people have been voluntarily seeking meetings with the mayor in recent days. He also stated that after the name of a certain wealthy person is announced, it will definitely have the effect of "killing one to warn a hundred," and he is convinced that the unfolding of fundraising work in the future will be more convenient.

Yesterday, a reporter asked whether all the wealthy people in this city were included in the city government's fundraising net. He replied: All wealthy people related to politics are not within the scope of the local area and are stipulated to be responsible for fundraising by the central government. In addition, Mayor Wu declared that the total amount of funds raised announced by the special relief donation fundraising committee, over four trillion yuan, includes US dollar bonds and garden houses and other real estate. In fact, the committee has only received one trillion yuan in cash, of which nine hundred billion yuan has been deposited into the Bank of Shanghai to purchase treasury bills, and the remaining amount is deposited in other banks, with the principal and interest used for the local organization of a garrison brigade. As for houses and bonds, etc., they will be publicly auctioned off on a regular basis.

### After the Implementation of Total War, the Jurisdiction of the Garrison Command Will Expand

The Garrison Brigade Can Be Established in Early October

Garrison Commander Xuan Tie Wu told reporters on the 13th that the rumors about the expansion of the jurisdiction and organization of the Songhu Garrison Command and personnel changes will depend on whether Songhu implements total war early. He had provided the authorities with opinions on implementing total war early. The relevant departments of the Ministry of National Defense once convened relevant agencies to discuss this, but this matter is of great importance and involves legislative issues, so it may take some time. As for the preparation work of the garrison brigade, it is now being accelerated. The selection of the brigade commander is pending approval from the Ministry of National Defense. In his ideal, this person should have considerable qualifications and prestige in the domestic military circle. According to reporters, the brigade is expected to be established in early October. Whether the inspection department of the garrison command will be directly under the Ministry of National Defense also awaits instructions from the authorities.

### A Batch of Nylon Stockings: Sealing and Storage Raises Questions – Yue Gu Bo Factory Claims They Are Domestically Produced – The Social Affairs Bureau Finds Handling Difficult

[Reported by this newspaper] After the ban on the sale of nylon stockings, the Social Affairs Bureau, together with the Police Bureau, seized 15 dozen and four pairs of men's nylon stockings and 13 pairs of women's nylon stockings from Dahua Department Store on Linsen Middle Road the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau suddenly received a report from the Yue Gu Bo Machine Factory at 3 Caojiazhai, Jiangsu Road, claiming that the stockings were produced by the factory. The factory had been approved by the former Ministry of Economic Affairs and issued factory registration certificate No. 12160. The customs also allowed the nylon stockings to be exported to earn foreign exchange. Although the raw materials for the nylon stockings came from the United States, the weaving was purely domestic. The factory currently has more than 200 workers. If the sale is prohibited, the factory will inevitably shut down, the workers will be laid off, and the impact will be very significant. After receiving this information, the Social Affairs Bureau felt it was difficult to handle, because the stockings were indeed domestically produced and registered with the former Ministry of Economic Affairs, but if they were returned, it would fear obstructing the ban. Therefore, the disposal method is still under consideration.

### Disputes in the Trucking Industry Resolved – Written Record Signed

[Reported by this newspaper] Trucking workers in this city requested an adjustment to their treatment. After the Social Affairs Bureau convened labor and management for negotiations, a written record was signed: (1) Both parties agreed on the method of paying wages. The increase or decrease in the original wage and vehicle towing force is calculated based on the fare, but the percentage of increase or decrease in the original wage and vehicle towing force is calculated at 80% of the percentage of increase or decrease in the fare. This is now changed to 100%. (2) Because the management of each industry sympathized with the workers' inherently low salaries, each industry made a one-time general increase. Niu Bingji's original wage of 4.8 million yuan was increased to 5.2 million yuan. Yin Fuju's original wage of 4.25 million yuan was increased to 4.5 million yuan, and the original 4.95 million yuan was increased to 5.2 million yuan.

### The Mayor Worries About the Public Utilities Impasse – Decides to Recommend to the City Council to Organize an Investigation and Deliberation Committee

[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the City Council's opposition to the price increase of public utilities, the City Government has decided to recommend that the City Council organize a Public Utilities Investigation and Deliberation Committee at the special meeting convened today to publicly investigate the accounts and business conditions of various companies. The committee hopes to be established on the 16th and completed by the end of this month. The case is scheduled to be implemented after being submitted to the City Council for approval today.

Mayor Wu met with reporters at the city government office at 5:00 PM yesterday and said that the public utilities price issue in August has fallen into an impasse. He had long anticipated that the price of public utilities would become a municipal problem. Mayor Wu specially showed the original texts of his letters of resignation to the Executive Yuan and the President on June 8th and June 29th. He said that the motive for resigning on June 8th was purely because prices could not be controlled and it was expected that public utilities would face the biggest crisis. The main factors for resigning on the 29th were rice allocation and refugee problems. Mayor Wu expressed great concern about how to break the current public utilities impasse. He believes that the price of public utilities can be reduced, but there must be reasonable conditions. If prices are reduced reluctantly before there is a remedy, the price increase in September will inevitably be even higher.

### A Misunderstanding on the Bus Caused a Conflict – Trolley Cars Halted for Two Hours – A Fierce Battle on the Bund Ended with an Apology

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday afternoon on Nanjing Road, a conflict occurred again between soldiers and trolley car drivers and conductors. Trolley cars on various lines of the British-owned routes 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, and 11 were suspended from 12:05 PM to 2:18 PM, a total of 2 hours and 13 minutes. The following is a record of what happened:

At 12:00 noon yesterday, the British-owned Route 1 trolley car No. 42 broke down after arriving at the Bund on Beijing Road and could not move. Just then, a Route 8 trolley car arrived and pushed the car to the Bund on Nanjing Road, tying it to the back of a Route 2 trolley car with an iron cable, intending to tow it back to the Hart Road factory for repairs. Just as they were about to start the car, a dozen or so people in military uniforms suddenly came and insisted on taking this damaged trolley car. The driver and conductor on the car told them that the car was going to the factory for repairs and would no longer take passengers, and asked them to take another car. Unexpectedly, this caused a misunderstanding and even led to mutual fighting. According to eyewitnesses, there were already three or five soldiers on the car at the time, arguing loudly with the driver and conductor in the car. One of the soldiers suddenly grabbed the fat driver's chest and pushed him hard, hitting the entrance door of the first-class carriage, and the glass shattered with a bang. The driver grabbed the man and refused to let go. When the other soldiers saw that an accident had occurred, they wanted to escape, so they stepped forward to push the driver away and got out of the car together, heading towards Renji Road. The conductor and driver shouted for help. At this time, more and more trolley car personnel gathered, the momentum was strong, and they shouted and swarmed along Renji Road in pursuit. One of the conductors took out his police whistle and blew it wildly to cheer them on. After a while, surrounded by dozens of trolley car workers, they twisted back one of the soldiers and locked him in the car. Some people shouted to beat him, and others shouted to stop them. While they were arguing, the rest of the soldiers suddenly rushed back to rescue the imprisoned soldier, which caused another battle. At that time, many passing soldiers also joined the fight. For a time, traffic in front of the Sassoon House was cut off. The "melee" lasted for about five minutes and then stopped automatically. Except for the ticket seller of No. 672, whose left eye was injured and bleeding, there were no other injuries. At that time, the police station had received the news and sent police cars, "Shanghai Security Guard" and other vehicles to the scene, and took the trolley car workers and the soldiers who caused the trouble back to the Huangpu Police Station. After questioning, it was learned that the group of people in military uniforms were students from a certain school and had military status, so they were transferred to the Penglai Road Military Police Headquarters. The group of military students, realizing they were at fault, apologized to the trolley car workers. The workers also felt that only one person was slightly injured and did not want to cause more trouble, and the dispute was resolved.

### The Dongshan Steamer's Secret: Smuggling 21 Kilograms of Opium

The Sanbei Shipping Company's Dongshan steamer arrived in Shanghai from Shantou yesterday at 4 PM and berthed at buoy number six. Customs inspectors boarded the ship to inspect it and discovered 21 kilograms of opium in the sailors' quarters, a truly astonishing amount. The opium was packed in a wicker basket and placed at the foot of a bed. The main suspect, the ship's cook, had already fled without a trace. Three crew members were immediately detained for interrogation.

According to shipping industry sources: The Shanghai Insurance Association considered the minimum transportation insurance cost for shipping companies to be far out of line with the price index. It was decided to increase the minimum insurance premium from 250,000 yuan to 2 million yuan, and the Shipping Association has been notified to inform all shipping companies to implement this starting immediately.

### Superintendent of Reformatory Accused: Decision Not to Prosecute

Two Laborers Charged with Illegal Detention

[Our Newspaper's Report] The sensational case of the murder of a foster daughter at the Women's Reformatory has been concluded after investigation by the District Prosecutor's Office. The Superintendent of the Reformatory, Sha Sailan, and the Section Chief, Yang Jiayuan, have been ruled not to be prosecuted. It originated when a woman from Liyang, Huang Wangshi, came to Shanghai last December to work as a domestic helper. After being dismissed, she got lost and was taken in by the Women's Relief Center. Later, Huang Wangshi, suffering from homesickness due to illness, colluded with another resident, Feng Wenmei, to secretly escape on the morning of May 11th at 2 AM. They were discovered and apprehended by two laborers from the reformatory, Shen Xinfa and Sang Liqi. On June 23rd at 3 PM, Huang Wangshi suddenly died of illness. The reformatory notified Pushan Villa to collect and bury the body. Neighboring residents, including Lu Shutian, heard that Huang Wangshi had died from being beaten and suffering a miscarriage. They filed a complaint with the District Prosecutor's Office, accusing Superintendent Sha Sailan and Section Chief Yang Jiayuan of homicide. After repeated investigations by the District Prosecutor's Office and an autopsy by the forensic doctor, which found that "there were no fractures or breaks in any of the bones" of the deceased, a decision was made not to prosecute. However, because the two laborers, Shen and Sang, used ropes to tie up Huang Wangshi and Feng Wenmei when they were apprehended, the District Prosecutor's Office has separately prosecuted them for illegal detention.

### Senior UNRRA Official Embezzlement Case: Retrial Concluded, Awaiting Verdict

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the previous case of senior UNRRA officials being accused of embezzlement, the District Court sentenced the defendants Hou Aichang and Jiang Renlin to three years and six months in prison each in the first trial. Hou and Jiang appealed to the High Court, which ordered a retrial. Judge Wu Xiangzu of the District Court held a hearing yesterday morning. The defendants Hou Aichang and Jiang Renlin, the respondent Deng Zhonghe, the witness Yang Liren (director of the Wool Textile Association), Gu Qixue (employee of Gongli Foreign Firm), and Zhang Shiwei (logistics section chief of Zhanghua Company) were all present in court. Hou Aichang testified: He started handling the allocation of wool in September of the 35th year. In the first allocation, each company received 300,000 pounds. Zhanghua complained that the quality was not good and later returned 200,000 pounds. The second allocation was in October of the same year, and Zhanghua voluntarily gave up. The third allocation was between December of the following year and February, when Zhanghua and Anle jointly received 120,000 pounds of greasy wool and 200,000 pounds of scoured wool. The fourth allocation was not carried out due to differences in the price difference, and no company received any. Jiang Renlin stated regarding the accusation of embezzling 178,080 yuan of reserve funds: The staff member Chen Tingchang paid for tea leaves, candles, and soap out of pocket, but the reimbursement was not approved, and Chen has not returned the money. Chen has now moved and his whereabouts are unknown. He also presented a letter of certification from the neighborhood chief in court. After the respondents and witnesses testified about the wool allocation figures, arguments began. The court decided to announce the verdict on the 20th of this month.

### Actress Chases After Her Lover: A Fight Erupts Over Jealousy

[Our Newspaper's Report] Li Qilian, a Peking opera actress, is from Guangdong, is 26 years old, and lives at No. 17 Xidan Street in Beiping. This Chinese New Year, the mother of Wu Suqiu, known as Lao Shandong, invited Li to lunch at No. 8 Dajing Hutong. Several people, including retired military officer Liu Zhushu, were present, and they had a pleasant conversation. After the meal, they engaged in a game of mahjong. Li was also invited to join, and ended up losing two taels of gold, which Liu won. Liu was generous and unwilling to have Li pay for her losses. The two developed feelings for each other. Liu visited Li's home frequently. One day, Liu invited Li to dine at the Tongchun Garden Restaurant. That night, Liu sent her back to her residence and became her lover. The two mutually vowed to stay together forever. Until June 24th, Liu left without saying goodbye and secretly came to Shanghai, staying at the China Hotel. Li soon found out and tracked him down to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, Liu had already gone to Keelung, Taiwan. After Li found out, she flew to Keelung. She found Liu at Sun Shaoxuan's place. Li said that she was pregnant and that he should not abandon her and sneak away. Liu tried to comfort her in every possible way. After several days of delay, they went to the Aiqun Hotel at No. 122 in Guangzhou on July 19th. After ten days, Li flew from Guangzhou to Shanghai and temporarily stayed at a friend's house at No. 7 Anyuan Lane, Xinzha Road. On the 7th of this month, she learned that Liu had also come to Shanghai from Hong Kong. Li went to the pier to welcome him. Recently, Li planned to return to Beiping and was preparing everything. Unexpectedly, at around 11 AM yesterday morning, Li passed by the entrance of the New World Company on Nanjing Road and saw Liu walking with another woman. Li went forward to greet him. Then the three walked together. Li criticized Liu heavily on the road. They walked and walked and walked, until they reached Fenglin Bridge in Nanshi. Unexpectedly, the woman walking with Liu suddenly retorted, claiming to be Liu's legal wife, named Gu Guozha, and accusing Li of ruining her family. The two then engaged in a brawl. The police took them to the Changshu Police Precinct, where they reached a settlement and left.

Except for those with military status who were directly sent for military trial, the remaining nine defendants were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation. The investigation has concluded, and they have been publicly prosecuted for disturbing order and causing injury.

### Murdering a Dance Hostess for Money: Wuxi Tragedy Solved; Key Suspect Zhu Jingqing Arrested in Qin; Jumped from Train During Escort to Wuxi, Severely Injured

[Our Newspaper's Report] Li Meiyu (24 years old), a dance hostess from the Hao You Navigator Agency at No. 4 Youhui Lane, Wanqian Road, Wuxi, went to the suburbs with two regular customers, Zhu Jingqing and Zhang Renzhong, on the 7th. Meiyu did not return that day. The next morning, a child collecting firewood climbed the summit of Ermao Peak (also known as Qingshan Bay) in Huishan and discovered the body of a woman dressed in luxurious clothing. There was a pair of trousers tied tightly around her neck, and there was a knife wound on her face. Later, the local township head of Huishan Town reported this to the local County Police Bureau, which sent police to investigate and reported this to the District Prosecutor's Office for inspection. The news spread, and the Hao You Navigator Agency also learned of it. They suspected something was wrong because Meiyu had not returned, so her husband went to identify the body, which was confirmed to be his wife. After the County Police Bureau investigated in all directions, they determined that Zhu Jingqing and Zhang Renzhong were the prime suspects. According to her husband, Meiyu had been wearing a pair of gold bracelets on her wrists, a pair of gold anklets on her feet, as well as a gold necklace, a gold locket, and a gold ring, totaling over three taels, all of which had been stolen. Therefore, it was determined to be a murder for money. After several days of investigation, it was learned that Zhu Jingqing was from Wuxi, 23 years old, and had been a guerrilla. He was originally a rogue. Last year, he worked as a worker at the Da An Rubber Factory on Huaide Road in Eastern Shanghai. Zhang Renzhong was from Jiangwan and worked with Zhu at the same factory. Zhu lived in a wooden house across from Huishan Lane on Qiqihar Road in Shanghai, and it was learned that the suspect had returned to Shanghai. On the night of the 11th, the Wuxi County Police Bureau prepared official documents and sent Criminal Police officers Huang Peng and Zhu Xin to Shanghai by train. After contacting the local police authorities, police were dispatched to assist. At 6:30 AM on the 12th, they rushed to the wooden house on Qiqihar Road and successfully arrested Zhu. He was temporarily detained at the Yulin Road Precinct. According to Zhu, he went from Shanghai to Wuxi on the 5th and stayed at No. 18 Dalu Hotel, then moved to No. 27 Yong'an Hotel. He returned to Shanghai at 4 PM on the 8th and vehemently denied being involved in Meiyu's murder. The suspect was escorted back to Wuxi by officers from the Wuxi County Police Bureau at 4:30 PM that afternoon to be investigated. Zhang Renzhong is still being pursued.

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 13th] Zhu Jingqing, the prime suspect in the Huishan murder case, was arrested in Shanghai yesterday. At 7 PM on the 12th, criminal police escorted him back to Wuxi. When the train passed Waitang, Zhu jumped from the train to escape, fearing punishment. He was arrested a second time in Qiujia Village near Weishi. Because he was severely injured, he has been sent to the hospital for treatment by the police before being interrogated again.

### Telecommunications and Transportation

— Diao Zhibing

(I)

Living in this modern era, people are moving forward with the wheels of time, and the relationships between people are becoming increasingly complex and close. The need for communication and contact is also increasing day by day. Therefore, post and telecommunications have become emerging public utilities today. However, due to the accumulated habits left over from history, there is not only no affection between the government and the people, but also a lack of cooperation, which affects the progress of work and fails to achieve the expected results. Leaving aside large-scale political facilities, let's focus on the telecommunications sector. If you hope that your telegram can be delivered to the other party quickly and properly, or if you hope that your phone will connect as soon as you call, then the "Telegraph Accuracy and Telephone Time-Saving Campaign" recently launched by the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau is a very effective method. However, despite repeated publicity by the Telecommunications Bureau, too few people understand and implement it, which cannot be said to be a regrettable shortcoming in the future development of telephone services.

A few months ago, telecommunications and postage stamp exhibitions appeared in Shanghai, attracting widespread attention and interest. The reporter will first discuss the relationship between telecommunications and transportation here, and the postal service will be discussed in a separate article later.

(II)

For a country like ours to progress from being backward to modern, we must engage in external development. The issue of transportation construction should be a primary aspect of all development. Transportation includes both spiritual and material aspects, namely, communication and transportation. Transportation is to a country as nerves and blood vessels are to the human body. Railways, highways, aviation, and navigation are the blood vessels, while telecommunications and postal services are the nerves. We have not seen a person with an unsound nervous system and blood vessel organization who can be healthy, just as we cannot find in the world a country with underdeveloped transportation that can be rich and strong. Building railways, highways, developing aviation, and opening up navigation are certainly active transportation construction, but they are ultimately insufficient to make the entire transportation system flexible and sound. Moreover, if this type of transportation is not coordinated with the development of communication, it will not be able to complete quickly and will lose its transportation effectiveness.

For example, the construction of a railway or highway requires the prior laying of telecommunications to connect various large and complex projects such as surveying routes, building bridges, constructing earthworks, laying sleepers, and hanging rails. Even after completion, issues such as traffic safety, vehicle dispatching, and all temporary emergency measures require telecommunications to transmit information. As for the operation of airplanes and ships in the air and at sea, they almost entirely rely on telecommunications to report weather conditions, guide directions, land, or approach the shore. Otherwise, there would be few that could operate freely as usual. Understanding this, we can see that the better and more complete the telecommunications equipment, the safer and faster various transportation modes will be. Therefore, telecommunications is not only an important means of transportation in itself but also the transportation of transportation.

(III)

Therefore, in modern times, communication, post, and telecommunications have become essential tools, and telecommunications transmission is particularly fast. Whether it is text or language, it can be transmitted from the ends of the earth to the corners of the sea instantly by means of electrical energy. It breaks the limitations of time and space, shrinks the scope of the world, and gives people a sense of "the world is like a neighborhood."

In the United States, last year, General Motors conducted a trial run of wireless telephone communication between the "Train of Tomorrow" traveling across the Midwest to Chicago and the "Queen Elizabeth" ocean liner sailing to London on the Atlantic Ocean. The voice originated from the train, traveled to Calumet City, then via landline to WGN radio station in Chicago, and then to the Queen Elizabeth liner traveling on the Atlantic Ocean 1,800 miles away. Passengers on the train and passengers on the ship spoke for 37 minutes with clear sound, achieving extraordinary success. Recently, many trains in the United States have wireless telephone equipment, providing passengers with great convenience in transportation.

Telecommunications technology is changing rapidly. The United States has recently invented a high-speed facsimile telegraph machine. This machine uses a high-speed telephoto method, using inertialess cathode rays, combined with rapidly moving photographic film, to transmit one million words per minute. In addition, the "SOJ Twelve-Channel Carrier Telephone" produced by the "Standard Telephone and Cables Company" in London, England, allows thirty-two people to speak simultaneously or three hundred and eighty-six people to send telegrams simultaneously on a pair of lines without interfering with each other. These achievements not only save material resources but also increase speed and reduce wasted time. Its contribution to transportation and all undertakings is self-evident.

(IV)

According to statistics from last year, there are approximately 51 million telephones worldwide. The United States accounts for 27 million, averaging one telephone for every five people. The United Kingdom has 3.9 million, one for every twelve people. France has 1.8 million, one for every twenty people. China has 160,000, one for every three thousand people. The telephone lines in the United States are 178 million kilometers long, and the telegraph lines are 3.6 million kilometers long. The telegraph and telephone lines in China are each approximately 100,000 kilometers long. Americans send an average of two telegrams per year, while in China, only one telegram is sent per thirty-three people per year.

From the above figures, we can see that the wealth and strength of a country must rely on the development of transportation, and the development of transportation must rely on telecommunications as a pioneer. China's telecommunications and transportation have suffered from the division by warlords and the devastation of the Anti-Japanese War. It was already deficient from birth, and later lost its conditioning. In addition, today's politics cannot be stable, the economy cannot prosper, equipment relies on foreign countries, and frequent civil wars cause destruction. Apart from a few large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou, which have made some achievements, the areas close to the war zones are full of scars and fragmented. Recovery is already difficult, let alone development.

(V)

If China does not want to be among the ranks of strong nations, then so be it. Otherwise, we should raise our vigilance, face reality, and face transportation. Emphasize the importance of telecommunications and transportation, and then build and develop the telecommunications industry, establish a close national communication network, and firmly shoulder the important tasks and missions assigned to telecommunications by the times.

### Telegram Long-Distance Telephone

— Zhu Rong

The general public is obviously accustomed to using long-distance telephones, but seems unfamiliar with the newer service of "telegram long-distance telephone." In certain situations, those who understand the method of telegram transmission can take advantage. Here, I would like to briefly introduce it.

When making a long-distance telephone call, the address of the receiving party is often far from the place of the call, requiring the telecommunications bureau to send someone directly to notify them (that is, to call someone to speak). It takes a lot of time to run to the place to answer the call after being notified, and sometimes the caller is busy with business and cannot wait for a reply from the other party, and there is no one to replace the caller. Therefore, this telegram telephone can be used to entrust the telecommunications bureau to be responsible for conveying what you want to say. Although you cannot directly talk to each other, its effect may sometimes be clearer and more understandable than talking directly.

Moreover, the procedure for sending and receiving telegram telephone calls is very simple. When the caller registers with the long-distance operator by telephone, first declare that it is a "telegram telephone" for the purpose of distinguishing it, and then report the "caller's name," "caller's telephone number," "receiver's address," "receiver's telephone number," "receiver's name," and a concise "content to be conveyed." The long-distance operator's recorder will immediately write it down and repeat it again. This can avoid errors. If the caller goes directly to the business office of the telecommunications bureau to register, it is even more convenient. In addition to filling in the name, address, and telephone number of yourself and the other party, you can also fill in the content to be conveyed in simple words and clear sentences on the registration form. The text should not be too long, preferably not exceeding thirty words.

This method is only applicable to "urgent call notification," and the call fee is charged at the rate of an urgent call notification. The telecommunications bureau can be responsible for conveying it to the other party within two hours. As for canceling the call and refunding the fee, it is handled in the same way as an urgent call notification.

### Why Can't the Telephone Connect?

— Ji Er

(I)

I recently visited a factory run by an old classmate. The factory has a telephone under the jurisdiction of the Telecommunications Bureau (commonly known as the (O2) telephone). Because I work at the Telecommunications Bureau, he asked me, "Why can't this telephone often connect?" I asked him what number he was dialing, picked up the receiver, and dialed for him, and it connected smoothly.

Huh! Is there a distinction between "insiders" and "outsiders" when making a phone call? It's hard to say.

I asked that classmate again what numbers he was trying to dial when he said it often wouldn't connect. After listening to him, it turned out that they were all telephones within the area of the Shanghai Telephone Company. I also asked him how he usually dialed (that is, how he dialed the desired number). Only then did I realize that the reason why his telephone often couldn't connect was mostly because he didn't know how to connect between the Telecommunications Bureau and the Telephone Company, and what dialing method should be used.

Indeed, because all the telephones in Shanghai belong to two major areas, in addition to the inevitable internal and external line obstacles that occur from time to time, the reason why most telephones cannot connect is probably the same as my classmate's, that is, due to not knowing the accurate dialing method. Therefore, it seems necessary to restate the connection between the two and how to dial. (The "Why Can't the Telephone Connect?" discussed in this article focuses specifically on how to dial from a Telecommunications Bureau user to a Telephone Company user. The following will focus on this topic.) Originally, the method for a Telecommunications Bureau user to connect to a Telephone Company user is to dial a "〇" (zero) after hearing a "dial tone," and then wait to hear the second "dial tone" (issued by the Telephone Company, which is the same as the "dial tone" directly heard by the Telephone Company users) before dialing the desired telephone number again.

(II)

The lines set up by the Telecommunications Bureau to connect to the Telephone Company for the above-mentioned connection function are 125 pairs at the Hongkou Bureau and 95 pairs at the Nanshi Bureau, called "relay lines." That is, the Hongkou Bureau can only have 125 users simultaneously dialing Telephone Company users, while the Nanshi Bureau can only have 95 users simultaneously dialing Telephone Company users. Therefore, if you occupy a pair of lines, other users have one less opportunity. However, it is usually not very difficult, because the time you occupy a pair of lines to connect and talk is mostly no more than two or three minutes. Even if you wait a little longer to call someone, it is only four or five minutes. Once the call is over, you hang up, and others can use it. Therefore, the number of relay lines mentioned above is sufficient to meet the current number of users. However, if you occupy a pair of lines and fail to use them well, so you cannot connect; because you cannot connect, you still occupy that pair of lines without releasing it, the result is that you still cannot connect, and other people's opportunities are taken up by you.

Now we should talk about why my classmate often couldn't connect. It turns out that although he knew to dial a "〇" (zero) after hearing the first "dial tone," he didn't care whether the second "dial tone" came or not, and went to dial the Telephone Company user number. If the second "dial tone" came after he finished dialing, that would be fine, he might have heard it and redialed; the worst thing is that when he was dialing in the middle (or had already dialed one digit, or two digits, or three digits, or four digits), the second "dial tone" came, but he dialed on his own, so it was as if he had only dialed four digits, or three digits, or two digits, or one digit. This is a problem of not dialing the entire number, so the machine is occupied by him, the phone is not connected, and he is still waiting! (For example, if he wants to dial 12345, he dials "〇" and then dials continuously. After dialing "1," the second "dial tone" comes, the result is that he dials 2345. If he dials another digit at random, for example, 6, then he dials the user at number 23456. And if he doesn't dial any more, then he stops.)

There are also many people who don't dial "〇" first and directly dial the desired number, so either they dial the wrong number or hear a "busy signal" that sounds like a "non-existent number signal."

There are also people who, like my classmate, dial "〇" and then dial continuously. After dialing, the second "dial tone" comes, but he thinks it is the first "dial tone" and redials "〇," and then it doesn't connect again.

There are also those who, after dialing "〇," wait for the second "dial tone" to come, but he puts the receiver aside and does other things; this is a bad method of trying to preemptively occupy the line because sometimes the traffic is busy, so the relay line is not easy to obtain, or the relay line is obtained but the second "dial tone" comes late. In fact, if you don't hear a "busy signal" after dialing "〇," then the second "dial tone" will eventually come, at most in one or two minutes; and now this second "dial tone" only lasts for half a minute. If you don't use it and dial a number within this half minute, then it is gone, but the machine is occupied in vain. So, if the above-mentioned person rests for a while and then picks up the receiver to listen, the second "dial tone" may have already passed, but he thinks it hasn't come yet and still puts the receiver aside and is still waiting. This is terrible, on the one hand, the machine is occupied and other users cannot use it, so the traffic becomes busier, so users want to preemptively occupy the line, and therefore the relay line and the second "dial tone" become more difficult to obtain, and he still complains that the phone cannot connect!

There are also people who, after dialing "〇," do hear a "busy signal" because all the relay lines are temporarily busy and not idle. At this time, they should hang up and redial after a while, but he still dials his number on his own, so there is no hope of connecting either.

The initial "dial tone" is a continuous "buzzing" sound. The sound issued by the Telecommunications Bureau is weaker and more scattered; the sound issued by the Telephone Company, that is, the so-called second "dial tone" heard after dialing "〇," is stronger and more direct. Users may wish to dial and listen when the traffic is quieter in the afternoon or evening, compare them carefully, and then they can distinguish them. After distinguishing them, they can hang up the receiver immediately, which does not count as making a phone call.

The so-called "busy signal," also known as "busy tone," is a "squeak...squeak...squeak..." sound. It indicates that the line is not free or that the telephone of the called user is in use.

The "non-existent number signal" indicates that there is no user with that number. At the Telecommunications Bureau, this sound is similar to the "busy signal"; at the Telephone Company, it is a "di di di di...di di di di di di..." sound.

There is also a "ringback tone," which indicates that the bell of the called user is already ringing. It is a "burr-luk-luk-luk...burr-luk-luk-luk" sound.

Therefore, to ensure that the phone can be connected quickly, in addition to the Telecommunications Bureau and the Telephone Company paying close attention to the internal and external lines, obtaining the cooperation of users and ensuring that everyone can dial accurately is also an important step.

### Telecommunications Knowledge Talk (10) (3)

— Zhang Jiayu

Lecture 6 How to Calculate the Number of Words (Continued)

Here, please first talk about the Chinese clear text telegrams, which account for more than 90% of all telegrams handled by the Telecommunications Bureau. Everyone who has sent telegrams knows that Chinese clear text telegrams are compiled and transmitted using the new telegraph code compiled by the Ministry of Transportation, with each group of four numbers representing a code. After the receiving station receives the telegram, it is translated from the new telegraph code into text and then delivered to the recipient. This method of translating text using telegraph codes is unprecedented in the world. The reason is that the structure of Chinese characters is too complex, so this unavoidable method is adopted. These points have already been discussed earlier, so I won’t repeat them here.

Since each Chinese character is limited to being composed of a telegraph code including four digits, the telegraph code combination that serves as the representative of the Chinese character is naturally counted as one word for every four digits—that is, representing one Chinese character—when calculating the number of words. If there are number groups in the telegram that must be used to accurately represent numbers, Arabic numerals can also be used directly, but a pair of parentheses must be added before and after the number group to avoid confusion with the telegraph code combinations representing Chinese characters. These number groups written in parentheses are also counted as one word for every four digits. If there are decimal points and other symbols, each symbol is counted as one digit. The parenthesis symbols added before and after the number group can be free of charge in domestic telegrams, but to make the meaning clear and meet the conditions that clear text telegrams must possess, an appropriate unit word, such as "yuan," "pieces," etc., must be added after each number group. For example:

(Example 1) "Shouxing yarn 1,500 bales" originally contains eight words. If written as "Shouxing yarn (1500) bales," it is counted as only five words for the fee.

(Example 2) "Unit price eighty-seven yuan and five jiao" originally contains eight words. If written as "Unit price (87·50) yuan," it is counted as only five words for the fee (because the number group in parentheses, including the decimal point, has exceeded four digits and should be counted as two words). Here, please consider again, if we write it as "Unit price (87·5 yuan," the meaning is equally clear, and we can save another word when calculating the telegram fee (because the number group in parentheses, including the decimal point, has only four digits).

In recent years, the legal tender has depreciated, and the amounts of money involved in buying and selling are mostly in the hundreds of millions. Therefore, the examples given above are no longer very practical. For example, rather than writing "twenty-five hundred million" as (2,500,000,000), which would be counted as four words for the fee (because there are a total of thirteen digits, including the apostrophes, which must be counted as four words), it is better to write "twenty-five hundred million," which is more straightforward. To avoid national customers suffering losses, the Telecommunications Bureau has recently added a temporary measure, which is to allow writing "twenty-five hundred million" as "(25) hundred million," so that it only needs to be counted as two words for the fee, which is ultimately more cost-effective than writing it out completely.

Regarding the methods of saving words in the wording of Chinese telegram drafts, although I don't want to provide specific examples, I would like to contribute some personal insights for readers to consider. Everyone knows that drafting commercial telegrams using the style of writing articles or letters is something that fools do. However, based on my observations from checking telegram copies, I feel that in addition to the style, we can go a step further and change the "words" used in the telegram draft to single characters that are sufficient to express the complete meaning, depending on the situation. For example, use the character "決 (jué)" to represent "決定 (juédìng, decide)," use the character "收 (shōu)" to represent "收到 (shōudào, received)," use "入 (rù)" to represent "收入 (shōurù, income)," etc. The reason why we say "depending on the situation" is that some "words" may seem similar on the surface, but in fact, they have different meanings. For example, "收到 (shōudào, received)" and "收入 (shōurù, income)" have different meanings. The former has the meaning of receiving some physical object, while the latter may only refer to the transfer of accounts. Therefore, when using "substituting characters for words," you must carefully consider and ensure that it does not violate the original meaning as a prerequisite.

Speaking of this, I am reminded of a very interesting past event: During the Anti-Japanese War, telegrams were subject to inspection. To prevent market disturbances, the authorities deleted all the words used in commercial telegrams sent from various places in the rear areas that described skyrocketing prices. Once, an inspector was slightly negligent and accidentally drew the line that was originally intended to be added to the character "飛 (fēi, soaring)" onto the character "漲 (zhǎng, rising)." I believe that after seeing this telegram, the recipient would not have regarded "價飛 (jià fēi, price soaring)" as "物價飛跌 (wùjià fēidié, prices plummeting)," right? From this, we can infer another new insight: Under the principle of not hindering the original meaning, some phrases composed of an adjective and a verb can also be represented by just one adjective. On the other hand, some clever and shrewd senders have already formulated some commonly used telegram terms in the invisible. For example, adding a "電 (diàn, telegraph)" character before an amount, such as "電百億元 (diàn bǎi yì yuán, telex 10 billion yuan)," means "a telegraphic transfer of 10 billion yuan." However, the same two characters "速電 (sù diàn, fast telegraph)" have two different meanings. We can interpret it as "reply by telegram quickly" or "telegraphic transfer quickly." You must understand it intuitively to be able to use it flexibly.

Chinese coded telegrams are only applicable to domestic telegrams and are stipulated to be composed of groups of four or five numbers. Each group is counted as one word for the fee. If there are combinations in the telegram that are composed of fewer than four or more than five numbers, the entire telegram must be counted as a foreign language letter telegram. The price of domestic Chinese coded telegrams and foreign language letter telegrams is the same. Counting as a foreign language letter telegram here is equivalent to saying that all the numbers used to compose number combinations in the telegram are counted as one word if they are within five numbers, and as two words if they exceed five numbers but are less than ten numbers, and so on by analogy.

If there are number combinations in Chinese coded telegrams that are actually used to represent numbers, Arabic numerals can also be used directly, and parentheses symbols can be placed before and after the combination. Regardless of whether the codes in the telegram are composed of four or five numbers, each group is counted as one word for the fee if it is within five numbers. If there are decimal points and other symbols in the group, each symbol is regarded as one digit. The parentheses added before and after are free of charge, just like in Chinese clear text telegrams, but for telegrams treated as foreign language letter telegrams, each pair of parentheses (including the opening and closing parentheses) should be counted as one word separately.

International telegrams made in Chinese code must be treated as letter telegrams for the entire telegram, which will be discussed later.

### Telecommunications Car

— This Publication's Data Room

At the "150 Years of Progress in Science Exposition" held in Baltimore, USA, at the end of last year, Western Union displayed a novel item in the telecommunications industry, a telegraph office mounted on a car—the "Telecommunications Car." This car was tested in the suburbs of Baltimore and achieved satisfactory results.

Looking back on history, the first telegram sent from Washington on May 24, 1844, was received by Baltimore. And now it should be very appropriate historically for this place to accept the testing of this invention.

When the "Telecommunications Car" travels in the designated residential area, the telegrams sent from the "Facsimile" transmitter of Western Union's Baltimore Bureau can be received by it through ultra-shortwave radio equipment. A "Facsimile" recorder is installed under the machine board of the vehicle, and these telegrams are automatically received by this recorder. Every telegram received is exactly the same as the original one sent. The messenger can immediately drive to the address indicated on the telegram and complete a very rapid delivery.

All telegrams or reply telegrams are collected by the messenger on the "Telecommunications Car" and quickly sent by radio to Western Union, and then forwarded by Western Union to various receiving locations. Mr. Lou Liang, the general manager of Western Union stationed in Baltimore, said: "During the experimental period, the 'Telecommunications Car' was designated to travel within a 12-square-mile area in the north of the city each time. When it travels to the area, any telegrams sent to that area are immediately sent from the Baltimore headquarters to the 'Telecommunications Car.'"

Looking back at the existing mobile telegraph offices in our country, although they do not have "Facsimile" equipment, they also have ultra-shortwave radio communication for rapid transmission. In the future, with gradual improvement, it may well become a "Telecommunications Car."

### Despite Slight Improvement in Loose Monetary Policy, Prices Rise Again Across the Board Yesterday; Rice Market Soars, Specially Selected Japonica Rice Exceeds 60 Million Yuan

Yesterday, prices rose again across the board, with the loose monetary policy being the biggest reason. The rice market rose due to high prices in Wuxi, with top-grade white japonica rice reaching 61 million yuan. Wheat flour prices also rose sharply due to increased purchases from the northern provinces. Fine cotton yarn and cloth prices were buoyant due to purchases by weaving factories. Silk exports were relatively active, leading to significant price increases. Western medicines rose in price due to increased costs. Although sales of tobacco and soap were not high, they were affected by other price increases and rose sharply. The financial market was excited, with Chinese stocks hovering near their peak. Gold jewelry prices continued to rise, with purchase prices at 520 million yuan and selling prices at 560 million yuan, still with demand exceeding supply. Exchange certificates once rose to 7.4 million yuan, but slightly declined at noon.

Yesterday, the monetary policy in this city was unusually loose, and the commodity market rose across the board. The "Four Banks, Two Bureaus, and One Treasury" had an advance of 115.25 billion yuan in the clearing of bills of exchange among the banking and money industries, with the Central Bank alone having an advance of 39.632 billion yuan, the largest amount. The Bank of China had an advance of 20.19 billion yuan, the Bank of Communications had a deficit of 26.871 billion yuan, the Farmers Bank had a deficit of 4.319 billion yuan, the Central Trust of China had an advance of 12.36 billion yuan, the Postal Remittances and Savings Bureau had a deficit of 2.887 billion yuan, the Central Cooperative Treasury had an advance of 2.715 billion yuan, the commercial banks and money houses had a deficit of 8.32 billion yuan in large clearings and a deficit of 19.47 billion yuan in small clearings. Foreign banks had a total advance of 87.77 billion yuan.

### Rice Market Surges, Grains and Oil Soar

Rice Market: The rice market is surging fiercely. Top-grade japonica rice has crossed the 60 million yuan mark, reaching a new price of 61 million yuan, a 10% increase. Prices in green production areas have risen, and arrivals have decreased. Other prices have also reached unprecedented levels. Holders have extremely firm intentions, raising prices by 2-3 million yuan early in the market. Subsequently, due to urgent replenishment by rice shops, market conditions were buoyant and unrelenting, leading to a further increase of 2-3 million yuan in the afternoon, totaling an increase of 5-6 million yuan. Thin rice reached 59 million yuan. Xitang new indica rice opened at 50 million yuan. Rice cargo owners are holding back and selling little, resulting in few transactions. Yesterday, arrivals in the two markets were 3,558 piculs.

Wheat Flour: Flourishing and reaching new highs daily. Yesterday, all brands of flour had broken through the 20 million yuan mark, an increase of about 15%. This is because wheat prices are high, and factories are increasing their offers, with very firm intentions. Lao Che opened at 20.9 million yuan and rapidly climbed to a high price of 22.3 million yuan at the close, an increase of 2.8 million yuan. Bing Chuan, Hong Feng, and Jian Cheng were each at 21.5 million yuan. Miscellaneous brands of flour rose buoyantly by more than 2 million yuan. Large bags of bran rose by 2 million yuan. Wheat was at 29 million yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains: Reaching unprecedented levels, rising sharply across the board. People are excited due to the sharp rise in rice prices. The yellow soybean market is very active with customers from other provinces. Jiujiang winter soybeans are being cleared by oil merchants at 40 million yuan, an increase of 4 million yuan. Corn from Qingdao continues to be added, rising by 3 million yuan. Wheat from Shantou is also joining in the purchase, with northern buyers rushing to advance even more urgently, adding 5 million yuan. Broad beans are priced 2 million higher. The sesame market is sluggish, with only a slight increase. Peas are also up 1-2 million yuan. Sesame is up by 6-7 million yuan, with white sesame reaching a high price of 90 million yuan. Raw peanuts are scarce and have unanimously broken through the 100 million yuan mark. Xuzhou raw peanuts are at 102 million yuan, an increase of 14 million yuan.

Cooking Oil: Rising sharply again. Due to the significant increase in yellow soybeans, factories feel the increased cost and are also insisting on high prices. Retailers are holding their ground even more forcefully. Due to the large increases in other prices, the market has leaped upward. Soybean oil initially traded at 162 million yuan, retreated to 158 million yuan in the middle, and then rebounded to 160 million yuan at the close, ultimately rising by 20 million yuan. Rapeseed oil also rose by about 20 million yuan. Raw oil jumped wildly by 23 million yuan. A barrel of raw oil costs 198 million yuan, approaching the 200 million yuan mark. Small-cart sesame oil rose by 1.5 million yuan. Soybean cake prices surged surprisingly, due to being favored by Shantou buyers, rising sharply by a significant 2.5 million yuan.

### Gold Control Bureau Reviewing Results of Inspection of Banks and Money Houses

[Report from this newspaper] Responsible officials of the Gold Control Bureau, in the past two days, convened all external investigators to review and report on the results of the recent inspection of banks and money houses. If any illegal activities are found in their operations, they will be reported. The results of this review will be released early next week.

Furthermore, the ten banks and money houses that were previously announced by the Bureau to have violated regulations have been ordered to replace their responsible personnel. It is now known that some of these ten banks and money houses have already changed their managers, assistant managers, and senior responsible staff. However, the Gold Control Bureau, in order to investigate responsibility, will still conduct an investigation to determine who is responsible and will punish them according to the law.

### Chinese Stocks Close Weak, Bond Market Strong and Steady

Chinese stocks were initially weak but then buoyant yesterday, but the amplitude was narrow, and the trend was meandering. Later, prices outside the ring trended higher, showing some signs of improvement. However, due to rumors of unfavorable news for the stock market and tightening monetary conditions, they closed weak.

Yongsha opened at 16,400 yuan in the morning, higher than yesterday's closing price by 100 yuan. Numbers 65, 168, 92, and 220 came in, and although it rose to 16,680 yuan, it became hesitant due to news of tensions in Berlin and the Lushan Conference. Also, since it was Friday, many parties had to bear two days' interest, so numbers 207, 99, 61, 152, 178, 183, and 48 and others vigorously sold off. Short sellers took the opportunity to enter, and prices fell, retreating to a low price of 16,180 yuan. Short positions were covered, and numbers 65, 169, 226, 76, and 154 all came to maintain the price, recovering to 16,400 yuan. However, people's hearts were weak and lacked support, so numbers 35, 71, and 61 came to buy at 16,200 yuan. After 10:30, news spread that yarn and daily necessities were rising alarmingly, and market sentiment began to improve, and buying interest suddenly increased. Short sellers were afraid and forcefully covered their positions. Numbers 117, 180, 76, 98, and 155 came in, and it rose again to 16,600 yuan. There was a slight meandering in the middle. Although numbers 116, 35, 56, and 206 came to sell at 16,300 yuan, because people's hearts improved, numbers 205, 65, 228, 154, 193, 178, 71, 78, 13, and 54 all came to buy, and retail investors followed suit, trending upward again. If the Central South Bank had not vigorously sold off at the close, Yongsha would not have ended at 15,800 yuan. Small stocks such as Xinguang, Qinxing, and Jingfu were favored and showed some signs of improvement because they had been quiet for a long time. As a result, compared to yesterday's close, Shangwu, Zhongfa, Xinyi, Zhabei, Yonggong, Yongdi, and Liandi rose to their limit. Jinglun and Xinhua rose more than half a percent strongly. Except for Zhongni, which fell to its limit, Yongsha, Xinguang, Jingfu, and others all saw slight increases.

Buying interest was even stronger in the afternoon. Yongsha immediately entered the market at 17,300 yuan. Numbers 187, 65, 207, and 168 and others all came to support the price, rising to 17,650 yuan. It was initially hoped that it would flourish, but the environment was unfavorable. The national banks had an advance of over 100 billion yuan, and monetary conditions tightened. There were many rumors, and the bulls' efforts were thwarted. The momentum then declined again. Numbers 117, 218, 156, 71, 176, 116, 178, and 224 and others sold off, and although there was still some meandering, only because the time had arrived, Yongsha ended at 17,050 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Zhongfa, Zhongchuan, Xinyi, Yongdi, and Liandi rose to their limit. The remaining stocks saw slight increases or remained flat. Unlisted stocks outside the market all reported increases of 10-20%.

Government Bonds: The rumor of currency reform became more heated, accumulating into a buoyant peak. Tongbing opened at 1.9 million yuan and immediately rose rapidly. Although room 360 Chengde sold off, rooms 552 and 550 took in at high prices, and it ultimately rose to a high price of 2.08 million yuan at the close. A and B also rose strongly by more than 10% compared to the previous close. Ding and Wu rose by 140,000 and 150,000 yuan respectively.

### Stabilizing Finance, Reducing Idle Capital: Restrictions on Shanghai Remittances from North China to Be Imposed Again

[News from the Commodity Research Institute] It is rumored that restrictions on Shanghai remittances from North China will be imposed again, which has had a considerable impact on people's sentiment. Many expect that if this move is implemented, the trend of monetary conditions in this city may temporarily change.

It is also learned that the government, in order to stabilize finance in Nanjing and Shanghai and reduce idle capital in the market, has decided to further limit the amount of remittances from various parts of North China to Shanghai. This financial severance policy seems to be a matter of great urgency, and the authorities will no longer pay attention to the opposition from people in North China and will resolutely implement measures. However, general observation is that after the severance, capital from North China will inevitably be transported in the form of cash, and the cash shortage in the North may become unbearable.

[News from the Joint Exchange] The financial authorities here, in order to assist the government in stabilizing prices, are still strictly limiting the amount of funds remitted to Shanghai by national banks and agricultural banks, in order to prevent idle capital from concentrating and stimulating the market again. The total amount remitted to Shanghai each day in the past has been reduced to 300 or 400 billion yuan, depending on the situation. Remittances from North China will also be significantly reduced.

### Rediscount Committee, Trade Committee Discussing Loan Applications

[Report from this newspaper] The Central Bank Rediscount Committee Trade Advisory Committee held its sixth meeting at 3 pm yesterday. Chairman Li Daofu presided, and all members participated. Four loan applications for rediscounting were discussed. The meeting approved the Bank of Communications' application for rediscounting loans for eight companies, including the China Vegetable Oil Factory, and two cases transferred from the Four Joint Offices regarding the Shanghai Tea Export Industry Association's request to adjust the loan amount for this year's export tea and extend the collateral deadline. The above two approved cases will still be submitted to the Rediscount Committee's regular meeting next Monday for approval.

### Fresh Egg Yolks Shipped to Little Luzon

[Report from this newspaper] The Aus-New Line's Aros, managed by Da Xiang Yang Hang, returned to Australia from Shanghai for the first time yesterday, carrying a large batch of 7,500 boxes of fresh egg yolks to Little Luzon.

### National Goods Joint Operation Company Promoting Overseas Markets

The China National Goods Joint Operation Company recently announced that the overseas market for national goods is flourishing. In addition to the continued export of cotton yarn and cloth, other goods are roughly divided into two categories: 1. Those that are designed to expand the scope of exports include more than ten companies such as the famous domestic Yapuer Huade light bulbs and Wuhe undershirts. 2. Those that already have a considerable amount of exports and are expanding their regions include Huasheng electric fans, China enamel porcelain, Yongsheng vacuum bottles, Feilun wood yarn, He Cheng factories towels, Shenyu socks, Hanyang handkerchiefs, etc., in order to develop national goods overseas in many aspects.

### Yarn Prices Reach New Highs, Leading Fine Cloth Approaches 90 Million Yuan Mark

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was active due to still loose monetary conditions, rising prices of various goods outside the industry, and eager purchases from local and out-of-town buyers. The industry players were actively trading among themselves. Inventories were depleted, and sentiment was exceptionally high.

The holders of 42-count blue phoenix fine yarn asked for 300 million yuan at the opening, willing to sell only at that price. Buyers mostly waited and watched, seeing that the price had reached its peak. Subsequently, it was learned that the yarn market in Qingdao was rising, and buyers from Tianjin, Guangdong, and other provinces were active, so the trend became even stronger, rising to 3.35 billion yuan for immediate delivery and 3.4 billion yuan for delivery tomorrow, continuing to rise wildly by 350 million yuan compared to the previous day. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn also rose sharply by 80-90 million to 150-160 million yuan each, with 80 lots traded.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market, stimulated by the increased allocation price of Fangjian the day before, and with insufficient inventories, the market price of 12-yard leading fine cloth rose by another 8 million yuan at the opening. Subsequently, due to news of economic plans being discussed in Lushan and rumors of currency reform, sentiment in the market suddenly weakened, and many speculative holders began to sell off. Buyers from North China also sold at high prices, and the market saw a decline of 200,000 yuan.

Unexpectedly, after 10 o'clock, because monetary conditions were still loose and the weather was gradually turning cool in the autumn, actual sales were about to begin, and buyers from other provinces became stronger. New buyers also came into action, and the leading market price rose again to 88 million yuan at the close, up 9 million yuan compared to the previous day (asking prices outside the market rose by another 3.5 million yuan).

The prices of mid- and low-end fine cloth such as Wufu, Laba, Tongyang, and He were also similar due to inquiries from dyeing factories, and the remaining fine twill, coarse cloth, bleached cloth, and serge cloth, khaki cloth, etc., were also firm and steady. 1,800 pieces were traded.

It is also reported that the market price outside the market declined in the afternoon. Leading fine cloth was initially priced at 92.5 million yuan, but there were not many new buyers, and there was no shortage of high-priced sales, and the market reported a low price. By the end, however, the price of 90 million yuan was held, an increase of 2 million yuan compared to the afternoon close. The price of Sijunzi Yuan serge was also 1.7 million yuan higher, but transactions were very rare.

It is also reported that the China Textile Company yesterday allocated yarn for the Central Bank and the Yarn Management Committee, with 273 eligible purchasers, allocating 683 lots, of which 101 lots belonged to the Central Bank and 582 lots belonged to the Yarn Management Committee, collecting 141.066 billion yuan. The China Textile Company also sold 892 lots of yarn, collecting 23.838 billion yuan.

### Export Green Tea Booming

Green teas such as Zhenmei and Zhenmei have been sold to North Africa in large quantities. However, since the asking price in this area has become stingy, transactions have been quiet at one point. However, because the Xinhua Tea Company first obtained a reply allowing it to increase prices, it has been reported that the Wu Chang Tea Company, etc., has also received a letter allowing it to relax tea prices, so the Huang Na has gradually increased, and the process has suddenly been revived. Unfortunately, it is ultimately affected by the empty warehouse, which is far from meeting the needs, so the amount of Wei Jiao is still inferior. In terms of price, it is more profitable on the rising exchange certificate. As for Qimen black tea, there is a continued demand and a shortage of supply. The potential is revealed in the quiet. As for the two types of crude tea, fried green and baked green, they are still only consumed domestically in a scattered manner, and the situation is meandering as before.

### Demand for Chinese Medicine Sluggish

The trend of Chinese medicine is weak. Local demand is sluggish, and the allocation of goods from other provinces is also fragmented. Many of the sourced goods have been repackaged into small boxes and small packages to meet current needs. 34 packages of Zhu Ling were received by mail. The customer price opened at 4 million yuan for Zhu Ling Wang, with only 6 mail packages, 2.2 million yuan for Ti Zhu Ling, with 8 mail packages, and 1.8 million yuan for Yuan Zhu Ling, with 20 mail packages.

Six packages of four-legged tiger bones were received by mail yesterday. The customer requested a price of 12 million yuan today. The merchant is currently unable to accept the offer due to the tightening of monetary conditions, and also because the market is quiet, so no price has been offered.

### Business Conditions in Various Places

Shenyang [Report from this newspaper in Shenyang on the 13th] A sudden autumn price increase has occurred. On the 13th, sorghum was 400,000 yuan per catty, soybeans were 200,000, pork was 700,000, soybean oil was 800,000, Bingchuan flour was 18 million, Yizhi Tiannv yarn was 40 million, Da Xiang cigarettes were 1.9 million per pack, and gold opened at 95 million (all in circulating currency).

Zhenjiang [Report from this newspaper in Zhenjiang on the 13th] Prices in Zhenjiang rose wildly again today. Top-grade rice was 5,600, wheat was 5,300, Green Jinshan flour was 20.5 million, soybean oil was 160 million per load, 20-count Xing Shi small package was 58.5 million, and Leading fine cloth was 94 million. Wuyang rose by 20% compared to yesterday. The purchase price of jewelry was 500 million, and the selling price was 560 million.

### Export Commodity Prices Rise: Export Exchange Settlement Reaches Over 3 Million US Dollars Last Week

[Report from this newspaper] The Export Management Committee recently issued a brief statement classifying the domestic and foreign market prices of China's main export commodities within the past week as follows:

In the first half of this week (August 1st to 7th), monetary conditions were tight, and general prices were stable. In the second half of the week, prices rose across the board. Major export products such as tung oil, bristles, raw silk, yarn, cotton fabrics, and oilseeds also rose. This was especially true at the end of the week, resulting in an average increase of about 15% in export goods this week compared to last week. Foreign market prices were stable except for tung oil and peanut oil, which fell. The market sentiment for exchange certificates was also good, breaking through the 7 million mark at the end of the week. The weekly average was about 5,650,000 yuan, an increase of 44% compared to last week. This is very stimulating to exports. The following is a brief description of the domestic and foreign market conditions for several major export products.

Tung Oil: Domestic prices rose sharply. Top-quality tung oil rose from 100 million yuan to 155 million yuan per market load, an increase of 50% within the week. Foreign prices fell instead. At the end of the week, the price in New York fell to US $0.20 per pound, and the price in London was £148 per British ton. The reason is rumored to be that a powerful exporter was dumping at low prices in the United States. General exporters are optimistic about exchange certificates, and devaluation sales and smuggling exports to South China also have an impact.

Bristles: Costs are also gradually increasing. At the beginning of the week, Shanghai and Hankou bristles each rose to 1.5 billion and 1.7 billion yuan per Sima load, an increase of 20-30% respectively, and the market was unstable. At the end of the week, Shanghai 17th grade surged to 2.1 billion. Foreign prices were very stable. Due to the surge in the price of exchange certificates, exports of various colors of Shanghai and Hankou bristles can make a profit of 10-30%. Tianjin bristles, on the other hand, lose 2-3%. Exports are still active. Exports in the last month reached 3,000 loads. The largest market is still the United States.

Tea: New goods have been launched on the market. This week, black tea and green tea each rose by 40% and 30%. Calculated by exchange certificates, although black tea is slightly loss-making, green tea exports are still profitable. With the assistance of the China Agricultural Bank's tea loan, the quality of new tea has improved, but the output is only 70% of last year. Although foreign merchants who received samples were satisfied, they were stingy with their offers, and it is difficult to hope for transactions to start. Therefore, the foreign tea market has been bleak recently.

Raw Silk: The price has risen sharply this week. The initial price of grade B 83 uniformity factory silk was 2.45 billion per package at the beginning of the week, and rose to 2.95 billion on Saturday, an increase of 20%. The foreign price in New York is still US $3.30 per pound. Export losses are very large, and exports are extremely sluggish. Japanese silk has recently begun to rise, adding a strong enemy to sales. However, French raw silk importers are still fond of our silk, such as Jin Shuang Lu brand.

Feathers: The market for dry casings is still stable. The increase in the actual price of exchange certificates is beneficial for exports.

Beans and Seeds: Domestic prices of beans and seeds are rising gradually. Soybeans and broad beans each rose by 30%. Sesame seeds and rapeseed rose sharply by 50%. Sesame exports barely cover costs, and the rest are loss-making. The market price of oils has also increased by about 20-30%. Except for rapeseed oil, which can make a profit of 10%, the rest have a loss of about 10%.

Rhubarb: There is no foreign demand. Musk has no buyers. There is no profit in exporting gallnuts and camphor.

Exchange: The export merchants' requests for exchange settlement in Shanghai this week (August 1st to 7th) have been statistically completed. The total amount has decreased slightly compared to last week, reaching a total of US $3,402,673.04. Among them, US $1,589,349.30 was sold to ordinary designated banks, and US $1,813,323.74 was sold by the government itself.

By commodity, the exports included US $576,220.89 in bristles, US $23.60 in tung oil, US $45,342.77 in fur, US $3,732.00 in green oil, US $45,252.82 in tea, US $42,627.39 in straw hats, US $6,596.10 in hog casings, US $20,611.36 in feathers, US $18,177.07 in metals and their products, US $1,867.50 in woolen yarn and raw silk, US $26,273.85 in fresh eggs, US $74,242.61 in cotton fabrics, US $39,212.93 in wool, US $21,305.20 in silk fabrics, US $16,294.80 in vegetables and their products, US $651,568.41 in miscellaneous items, US $204,962.08 in frozen eggs, US $1,246,201.15 in cotton cloth, and US $362,160.51 in cotton yarn.

### World Games Closing Ceremony Tonight; Chinese Basketball Team Ranked 18th; Sweden Defeats Yugoslavia in Football Final

[Report from this newspaper] London, 13th (broadcast): In the World Games football final, Sweden defeated Yugoslavia 3-1 to win the championship. Denmark defeated Great Britain.

[Report from this newspaper] London, 13th (broadcast): In the World Games basketball game, Mexico defeated Brazil, with a halftime score of 25-17.

[Report from this newspaper] London, 13th (broadcast): The 14th Olympic World Games will close on the 14th. The closing ceremony will be held at 6 pm, and all competitions will be concluded. There will be equestrian competitions on the 14th morning and afternoon, held at the Wembley Stadium.

[Report from this newspaper] London, 13th (broadcast): In the third-division ranking final of the World Games basketball game, the Chinese team could not compete with the strong fighting spirit of Italy due to discord among its soldiers. As a result of the fierce battle, the team lost 38-54. At halftime, China was 4 points behind at 25-21. Italy won the third-division championship, ranking 17th, while China ranked 18th. Huang Tianxi, the 6-foot-2-inch guard of the Chinese team, had left England ahead of schedule, making the already short-handed Chinese defense even more stretched. All the players, with their return imminent, longing for home like arrows, were also one of the reasons for the decline in fighting spirit. At the start of the game, the Chinese team played with Bao Songguo, Li Zhenzhong, Cai Wenhua, Li Shiqiao, and Wu Chengzhang. At the beginning of the game, they were able to perform above standard. Songyuan and Chengzhang scored repeatedly under the basket, and Shiqiao and Wenhua also occasionally made good plays, allowing them to take the lead. However, China's leading situation was only a flash in the pan. After 15 minutes, the Chinese team members gradually felt physically exhausted, and Italy took the opportunity to chase hard. The score went from close to tied, and then exceeded. China frequently substituted with reserve players, but there was still no improvement, and then they were unable to recover. Italy took the lead 25-21 in the first half. After changing sides, Jia Zhijun replaced Wenhua, and Cai Zhongqiang replaced Shiqiao. These new recruits had very few opportunities to play after arriving in England, so they played very hard. However, Italy also fought with all their strength and did not relax. When it was 38-25, Zhongqiang made a free throw, and Italy immediately returned the ball. Lao Bao fouled, and the Italian team added another point. The Chinese defender, Lao Bao, often defended far out, and Da Li was also in a state of exhaustion. Several times, the Italian forwards got the ball and rushed straight, traversing the Chinese basket as if entering an uninhabited place. When it was 45-29, Lao Bao's long shot failed, and Zhongqiang failed to shoot three times under the basket, and the Chinese team was stolen for two points instead. The Chinese team's defeat was a foregone conclusion, and only showed a slight struggle to do its best. At the end of the game, China lost eight goals with a score of 38-54.

### China's Failure at the World Games: Physical Disparity Too Great, Xu Minhui and Li Huitang Broadcast

[Our Dispatch] London, 13th (via radio): The 14th Olympic Games will conclude tomorrow. The Chinese delegation has packed and awaits their flight home. A special correspondent from the BBC interviewed the team's director and coaches, requesting their reflections on the trip. The conversations will be recorded and broadcast to the Far East via the BBC radio station.

Xu Minhui, a veteran of the sports scene who participated in the previous games as a swimming instructor and coach, believes the primary reason Chinese athletes have not been able to compete effectively with European and American countries in sports is their inherently weaker physical constitution. Xu stated, "China has failed to win any medals in the track and field events and other sports at the Games. This is fundamentally because there is too great a difference in physical build between the Chinese and Europeans and Americans. This is especially evident in the track and field pentathlon, where it is almost impossible to compare with Europeans and Americans. In track events, the gap is somewhat smaller. Although the difference in results in the intermediate hurdles was not large, it is regrettable that Chen Yinglang was eliminated in the 400 meters, finishing third by just an arm's length. Qi Wen'ao should have scored in the 10,000-meter race, but unfortunately, he failed due to various obstacles. On the final day, he fought hard in the marathon, and although he did not finish the entire race due to physical limitations, he maintained a leading position for the first half, making his defeat honorable. If Huang, Chen, and Lou can work even harder, I am extremely hopeful for them to score in the 15th Games in 1953."

Li Huitang, the captain of the football team at the previous World Games and this year's football coach, also believes that physical strength is the biggest factor influencing China's failure to reach world football standards. Regarding tactics, he stated, "Currently, the strong European teams are using the third-back defensive formation, but they have not mastered it completely. They easily fall apart when facing a stronger opposing attack. The biggest weakness of the Chinese team is that their physical strength and stamina are far inferior to others. This was the first time we participated, and the fact that we lost four games in a row was largely due to physical factors. For Chinese football to reach world standards, it is necessary to promote rising talents and focus on fundamentally improving physical fitness. The best approach is to learn from European countries and hire British coaches to return to China and train new talent."

### Changes to International Basketball Rules: Preventing Tall Players from Gaining an Advantage, Widening Free Throw Area, Adopting Three-Second Rule, Approved by International Basketball Association Subcommittee

[Our Dispatch] London, 13th (via radio): The Rules Subcommittee of the International Amateur Basketball Association voted on Wednesday to widen the narrow, elongated section of the free throw area near the basket from six feet to twelve feet, hoping to help shorter guards and reduce the chances of seven-foot giants putting the ball in the basket. This change may be the most progressive rules reform in twenty years.

The American "three-second rule" was also adopted. This rule will prevent all players from staying in the free throw area for more than three seconds. Although the subcommittee did not specifically announce the motive for adopting this rule, it is clear that the "three-second rule" is designed to prevent seven-foot giants from standing under the basket as "goaltenders," blocking the ball from entering the basket. According to the new rules, the free throw area will be shaped like a city gate. During free throws, no players are allowed to enter the "city gate area" until the ball touches the backboard or rim. After the ball touches the backboard, players can, of course, rush in to grab the ball, but they still cannot stay for more than three seconds.

### Rainy Roads Cause Riders to Fall

### On Being Fierce in Appearance but Weak Within

— Ji Yong

The weather is extremely sultry. Although it is already the beginning of autumn, there is no hint of coolness. I can only recline on my bamboo bed and read something that doesn't require much brainpower. Yesterday, I flipped through Mr. Wu's Twenty Years' Witness to Strange Happenings in Foshan. This is a very ordinary book, but today, especially for people like us who have experienced a bit of hardship, it has a different meaning. I can't help but admire Mr. Wu even more.

Although the second half of this book is still fragmented, it seems to be mostly represented by "Gou Cai." Gou Cai is probably also the Typical character of the entire book. After he ingratiated himself with the errand boy of the silver dollar bureau in Anqing Province and made a fortune, a five-province imperial envoy suddenly arrived to investigate various corruption cases. The imperial envoy was initially very fierce and said to be incorruptible, but eventually, Gou Cai found a connection, spent 600,000 taels of silver, and was acquitted. The book criticizes this imperial envoy as a person who is "fierce in appearance but weak within." These four words unexpectedly moved me deeply.

The Record of Officials' Appearances in Nanting Pavilion also records many imperial envoys investigating corruption cases, and the results are similar to those of the nine-province imperial envoy, almost becoming a formula. Once, an imperial envoy absolutely refused to meet guests and did not speak, making him even more unfathomable. Later, someone in the know said that this was called "drawing the bow without releasing the arrow," and the reason for not releasing it was to wait for a good price. Eventually, through the mediation of several brokers, everyone satisfied their own desires.

When we examine the identities of those who are weak within, we find that they are mostly "seeds of scholars." The reason for this is "worthy of deep thought."

Confucius cannot be said to be not stern. He killed Shaozheng Mao for his heterodox views, banished the seductive Zheng melodies, and even found fault with the color purple because it stole Zhu. But when he lost power and traveled far away, why did he go to see the petty ruler of Wei? This made Zilu very unhappy, and later generations of "unorthodox" people were even happier to add fuel to the fire, turning the "sound of jade pendants" into an opera, insulting the sage. Even someone as obedient as I can't help but suspect that the old master's "not walking to the Zhejiang River" and his unwillingness to ride with Yong Qu had other reasons! The problem is very simple. Scholars take "unifying the world with Yao and Shun" as their duty. Over time, they become "four limbs unaccustomed to labor, five grains undifferentiated," only able to play the role of "teacher." Therefore, once they lose their jobs, apart from rushing around and "carrying praises when leaving the country," they are left with only "being anxious."

Of course, if one is right, one is confident. As Mencius said, "accumulated righteousness generates energy," "its energy is extremely great and strong, and can fill the space between heaven and earth." Logically speaking, scholars should accumulate the most righteousness, and their energy should be the most righteous and greatest, so there is no weakness. However, knowledge is not necessarily all righteousness, it also allows people to understand "profit and loss." If profit and loss are based on the individual, they will undoubtedly contradict righteousness. Therefore, when it comes to risking one's life in danger, they will think about how painful it is to have a knife cut their shin, and they will confirm Yang Zhu's philosophy: "Living as Jie or Zhou, dying as rotten bones; living as Yao or Shun, dying as rotten bones. Rotten bones are the same, who knows the difference?" The former may be understood by carters and porters, but the latter can only be understood by those who have drunk ink. Therefore, what the ancients said about "it is difficult to die calmly" is because when one can be calm, there is plenty of time to consider these issues, so even a hundred-refined steel will turn into a soft touch, and one will become dispirited. Conversely, ordinary people who do not have these considerations probably only know one truth, such as "repaying kindness" or "clear distinction between gratitude and resentment," and with one breath, they can do earth-shattering things. Wu Meicun's Lu Qiao Jiwen, Volume 2, "The Fall of Yu Yuan," has two chapters specifically discussing these people. For example, the chapter on "Servants" records that Commander Cao Cunxing wanted to surrender Nanjing to the Manchus, but his soldiers refused to surrender and threw themselves off the bridge to die; Marquis Anyuan Liu Changzuo surrendered to Prince Yu, and one of his soldiers stopped him, but he did not listen and threw himself into the river to die; there are many similar facts. The chapter on "Beggars" records that the Qinhuai beggar who refused to surrender to the Northern Army even wrote a poem before his death: "For three hundred years, the court has supported scholars, how can civil and military officials all escape? The moral principles remain in the lowly field court, and beggars are ashamed to preserve a life!" This poem is obviously an exaggeration by later generations, and even the facts may have to be discounted, but it is a great satire when compared to the commander and marquis. What a pity that Mr. Wu himself was also fierce in appearance but weak within, and eventually became a "sacrificial wine" that was "worthless"!

This is called "the distinction between righteousness and profit, difficult to speak of!"

### Wine, Women, and Extravagant Living: The Princes of India

— Yanbo

Last year on August 15th, India gained independence and was divided into two countries: India and Pakistan. Everyone knows this.

However, before August 15th of last year, India was in fact already more than one country. When the British Empire ruled India, it used five hundred and sixty-three sets of laws. The India that produced Gandhi and Nehru was just one of these five hundred and sixty-three countries. The other five hundred and sixty-two were princely states of varying sizes. After the partition of India and Pakistan, five hundred princely states joined India, sixty-one joined Pakistan, and only the largest and richest Hyderabad remained independent, as it had been.

The Indian government plans to merge these five hundred princely states into twenty-five units. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs Patel believes that this is necessary to promote democracy. However, Nehru strongly advocates maintaining the rights of these princes, as long as they recognize the rule of the new Indian state and allow the Indian government to manage foreign affairs, military affairs, and transportation, they can still maintain their original status.

These princely rulers gladly agreed and still receive an annual salary of nine million US dollars. However, they can no longer live the extravagant life they once had.

The late *Life* magazine correspondent in India, Fischer, recorded the stories of these Indian princes' wealth and debauchery in a monograph. Here are some excerpts for the readers.

These princes liked novel and fun things. One prince specially manufactured a machine. As long as he pressed a button, the room would immediately be filled with the fragrance of various perfumes. India is extremely hot and has many mosquitoes. Sometimes when the prince could not bear the disturbance of mosquitoes, he would press another button on the machine, and the room would immediately be filled with fine droplets of Flit insecticide.

Another prince, when hosting banquets, often had a small flying car circling around the long, oval dining table in the center of the dining room. The electric car was filled with various kinds of fine wine. When a guest picked up a wine bottle, the electric car would automatically stop. After the guest poured the wine and returned the bottle to its original place, the electric car would immediately move forward again.

One prince liked to raise dogs and specially built countless exquisite "dog houses," with a large number of people serving these dogs. Sometimes when the prince traveled at sea, the dogs would travel on a separate ship, following him closely. This prince also liked to hunt. Every time he went hunting, he would mobilize a large number of people to set up the hunting grounds for him, including tents for receiving subordinates, tents specifically for bathing, tents for male and female servants, and tents for the prince to rest—decorated with various colors of silk, and the ground was covered with extremely thick carpets.

These princes were naturally "well-fed and warmly clothed" people. Next, we will talk about the issue of women.

There was a princely state called Patiala. Patiala had a prince who married fifty-two wives and had three hundred and fifty children. He gave each wife 10,000 rupees as a betrothal gift, and another 10,000 rupees for her to buy clothes. This expense was of course considerable, so he increased taxes on the people: he was surrounded by women, while the people were in dire straits.

After this prince died, his fifty-two wives were all sent back to their hometowns. A special orphanage was built in the palace to accommodate these three hundred and fifty princes. However, the officials and people of Patiala placed great emphasis on the background of these children. The children born to the former king's "official" wives were all hired with English nannies and entered and exited the palace through the front door. The children born to the "unofficial" wives were all hired with Indian nannies, and if the children wanted to play outside the palace, they could only enter and exit through the back door.

The great prince of Hyderabad, the largest princely state in India mentioned above, is now seventy-two years old. He wears glasses, has a thin figure, but is still very lecherous. He currently has four formal wives and about two hundred concubines. This old man loves money like his life. Everyone says he is the richest man in the world and also the most incorrigible miser. Although he has many wives, he himself lives in a shabby house and wears tattered clothes. One day, an official went to see him, and he happened to be taking a nap. The official frowned and came up with an idea. He calmly took out two silver coins and gently tapped them next to the richest man in the world's ear. The two silver coins made a clear and pleasant tinkling sound—the great prince seemed to perk up, and his sleepiness immediately disappeared!

### Reasons for Divorce

— Jinlin

In Elizabeth, a woman gave the reason for divorce: "He gives me five dollars every night, and when I fall asleep, he secretly steals it back. In the morning, he scolds me for being careless!" she cried.

In Wisconsin, USA, a woman requested a divorce from her husband, the reason being: After she married her husband (a retired naval officer), she had to sleep in a hammock every day. She had fallen out of it sixteen times in twenty-three years. Now that she is older, she can no longer endure the pain of falling.

A husband in Los Angeles complained to the court: "Every time I woo my wife, she asks me for five dollars for a kiss. So five dollars, five dollars, five dollars... such a number is beyond my ability to bear."

"I Have an Ailment" This is the prince of Hyderabad, the largest princely state in India, who is seventy-two years old, has four wives and two hundred concubines. This old man loves money as his life, and he is extremely rich. Some say he is the richest man in the world. (Please refer to the article "The Princes of India.")

### To Chen Julai

— Fang Chong Shen

Chen Julai of Pinghu is a famous seal carver and a talented disciple of my old friend Yuan Hanyun. He can integrate the Zhejiang and Anhui schools into one, and both intaglio and relief are extremely wonderful.

Hanyun is gone, separated by mountains and rivers, his disciple can do many things, sweeping away the idle gate and moving mountain bones, the small red seals are like Kai Bo.

How many generations have the Zhejiang and Anhui schools been divided? He can combine the six kingdoms and call himself Qin! Look at the dragons and snakes moving under your wrist, you should give gold to others every day.

### Miracle in Shanghai's Music Scene: Harmonica Enters the Symphony Orchestra

— You Ting

Just two years after the death of Maestro Pacl, the symphony orchestra he painstakingly founded (formerly the Municipal Council Orchestra, now the Shanghai Municipal Orchestra) has become increasingly small. Violin virtuoso Atler and cello master Dukesen have returned to their countries one after another, and the famous conductor and pianist Magolinsky also left long ago. Today's Municipal Orchestra has only twenty or thirty members left. The treatment is poor and the management is lax. The two summer concerts held since the summer have been lackluster.

Last night (August 11th), the orchestra's second summer symphony concert had an "amazing" program: a harmonica solo accompanied by a symphony orchestra, which was unprecedented. I had to rush from Hongkou District to the French School to hear it. I thought that the harmonica for this solo must be an "atomic" or "super" type, but it turned out to be just a normal chromatic harmonica. All the shortcomings that prevent the harmonica from being a formal instrument are all present in this chromatic harmonica. Therefore, even though its volume was amplified by a single "microphone," it still sounded extremely unharmonious. In the first piece, Kreisler's "Vienna Fantasy," the soloist was only able to show his fast-paced melody technique with the harmonica. Everything else was bland and tasteless, and because the harmonica was passed through a "microphone" while the other accompanying instruments were isolated from the "microphone," there was a particular sense of detachment in terms of volume. This "innovative" program damaged the artistic level and abused the ears of countless listeners!

Everyone knows that: (1) The harmonica's sound depends only on blowing and sucking, and its expression of melody is extremely limited. For example, if several notes in a quick tempo are all blown or sucked, and are all continuous beats, then it is beyond the endurance of human lung capacity; (2) The harmonica's timbre is dry, weak, and monotonous, and it cannot express the tension and relaxation of emotions and the richness of colors in music. Even if the normal rules of music are ignored and it is played through a microphone, it can only amplify the volume and cannot improve the timbre; (3) The timbre of the harmonica that has passed through the "microphone" is quite similar to the wind instruments in the orchestra that produce sound with reeds. However, in terms of timbre, volume, and range, these wind instruments are more advanced and complete than the harmonica, and the capabilities of other stringed instruments are of course far superior to the harmonica. Therefore, using a symphony orchestra to accompany the harmonica is tantamount to teaching people to listen to the accompaniment and abandon the main melody. Even in the United States, where jazz music is popular, only guitars, saxophones, etc. are included in the band, and it is rare to see a formal orchestra accompany a "harmonica solo." Of course, large harmonica ensembles, combined with accordions, pianos, or other wind and string instruments, are common. The so-called harmonica symphony orchestra also exists in Shanghai. However, these symphonic pieces must be adapted, and are not in their original form (the harmonica solo by the Municipal Orchestra this time was also adapted). Readers can hear the difference between harmonica ensemble symphonies and symphonies played by real orchestras on the radio, and after listening, they will understand: Is the harmonica a "musical toy" or a formal instrument? Should it be accompanied by a formal symphony orchestra?

Of course, the Western musician in charge of the orchestra is not ignorant of these principles. However, one reason is that he was repeatedly requested by the soloist, and another is that there are various difficulties today (it would take a long time to explain), so the program inevitably lacks quality.

There is naturally some justification for this, but for the sake of the art of Shanghai, the largest city in the East, and the next generation of the nation, we really cannot remain silent.
