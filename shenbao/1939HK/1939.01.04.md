### Travel Diary of Hunan, Guizhou, and Yunnan

— Chen Zhixiong

Changsha—Changde, October 16th: I got up at around 5 o'clock this morning. The noise from the street was incessant. I pushed open the window and saw student soldiers gathering, doing exercises and taking walks, a lively scene. Soon, I asked the tea attendant to move the luggage downstairs. I took a rickshaw to the main dock. I saw many colleagues who had already boarded the boat. The boat was small and crowded, and many people were sitting on the roof of the boat. After a while, the center of gravity was lost. This morning the wind and waves were very strong, the boat tilted, now to the left, now to the right, a very dangerous situation. When the boat reached the center of the river, the waves surged, almost submerging us. I was terrified. After the boat sailed to Shuizhen Island, we all went ashore and took a second ferry. At this time, although the wind and waves were strong, the boat was much more stable than before. After arriving ashore, we went ashore. The cars had gathered, a total of three, carrying a total of fifty-four people. After waiting for about an hour, we added enough gasoline and started driving. This was almost my first time taking a long-distance public bus. The seats inside the car were narrow, and the glass windows vibrated violently while driving. The speed was about forty kilometers per hour. Due to the air absorption effect, dust and ash came out of the furnace, covering our clothes. We all covered our mouths with handkerchiefs. Fortunately, I was sitting in the front of the car, and the vibration was not very severe. If I were sitting in the back of the car, the pain would be unbearable.

Both sides of the road were lined with trees, and the road was very flat, a deep red color. Looking down from the carriage, it was very spectacular. Sometimes the road cut through mountains, sometimes high, sometimes low, like a long snake. There were still many villages along the way, not very desolate. The car traveled for a long time, and we were very tired. After the car passed Wangcheng Slope, the mountain road became more and more dangerous, rising and falling. At some points, it seemed like we would fall off. Before long, the car arrived at Bai Ruoshi, connecting Ertong Ershi Bo, directly reaching Liudu. After passing Sishi Bridge, we arrived at Jiang Bridge. The bridge was magnificently constructed. The car stopped briefly when it reached Duoxiang.

From Changsha to Ningxiang, it is forty-four kilometers. From Ningxiang to Bai Ruo, it is eleven kilometers. From Ningxiang to Yiyang, it is sixty-five kilometers. From Ningxiang to Changde, it is a total of one hundred and forty kilometers. After passing Long Bridge, the road along the way was exceptionally desolate. Although there were newly built Xiangyi Inns on both sides of the road, they were all dilapidated. Only the Xinyi Middle School building was relatively neat. After the car passed Yiyang, it arrived at the riverbank. The passengers all got off the car and unloaded the boat to cross the river. The car then drove into a large ship. After arriving on the other side, we got back on the car and passed Cuijia Bridge, Taiqian Temple, Dashi Bridge, and arrived at Sandianshui, where we had to cross the river again. We had crossed the river several times from Changsha to this point, getting on and off the car, which was quite troublesome. The inconvenience of inland transportation can be seen here. However, sitting in the car for a long time was like being in prison, making us dizzy. Being able to get out and rest was beneficial to our mind and body. From Dashi Bridge to Changde, it was only ten kilometers away. When we arrived, it was already 2:30 in the afternoon. We found the Min'an Inn at Changde Station, which charged only six jiao per person, including lodging and two meals, which was very cheap and beautiful. After a short rest, we took a civilian boat across the river into the city. The area was not very large, and business was not prosperous. All the shops were located along Zhongshan Road. There were many silk shops, but few restaurants. We first entered from Lin Yuan Gate, passed through Zhongshan Street, Nüwa Street, Nanshan, Xiaonanshan Street. The stone roads were paved with stone and were quite clean. The women in the city all wore black clothes. It was not very elegant to see young girls dressed like this, and it did not express the lively spirit of young women. This habit should be improved. At that time, the sky was already slightly dark. We called a boat to cross the river, costing one jiao. According to the boatman, bandits often appeared near Changde, and guests who encountered them often met with unforeseen circumstances. Therefore, he advised us to cross the river as soon as possible. He also said that Wuling was still ninety li away from here. As he spoke, a bright moon appeared in the sky. Looking at the green hills in the river from afar, it was hazy. The waves and moonlight reflected each other, which was very eye-catching. By the time we returned to the dormitory, it was already about 7 o'clock.

Changde—Yuanling, October 17th: The car departed from Changde Station at 8 o'clock this morning. The scenery was very good. At about 7:45, we arrived at Taoyuan. Beside it was a cave, and in front of it was a stream, accessible by boats. My colleagues all got out of the car to rest. After a while, the car and people crossed the river together. After arriving at the riverbank, we had to get back in the car. At 9:10, we arrived at Zhengjia Post Station. The scenery from Taoyuan to here was the most beautiful and clear. At 9:40, we arrived at Cha'an. This place is 265 kilometers away from Changsha. After passing Taipingpu, Huangtujin, and Sandushui Station, we arrived at Qingshan Gang at about 11 o'clock. The road was dangerous and steep. Sometimes we went up the mountain, sometimes we went down the mountain. At the end, we found new life in a desperate situation, like a long snake winding through the mountains. The number of turns was the most I had ever seen in my life. I was dizzy and nauseous. Fortunately, I brought Bagua Pills and Mentholatum to treat it. Then I used my hand to tighten my head, which relieved it a little. For those who travel long distances, it is true that you cannot go a day without this thing. As for masks, towels, chair cushions (it is best to hide something soft in the middle, because the car is very fast and vibrates a lot. Without this thing, your butt will suffer), after crossing several mountains, we arrived at Nan'an Temple and Taofanpu. The last four kilometers made people extremely tired. My head was dizzy, and the dangerous places were something I had never experienced in my life. The cars were all driving on cliffs, sometimes thousands of feet high. The peaks stood angrily, and looking down made my heart pound. The difficulty of traveling was unparalleled. Even thinking about it now makes my heart pound. After Yuanling Station, we checked into a hotel. The hotel was cleaner than Changde. After a short rest, we crossed the river to Yuan City. The city was not very big. We first entered from Zhongnan Gate. Along the streets, there were many yams and fresh mushrooms for sale. Eating them carelessly could easily lead to poisoning. The streets were paved with stone, just like Changde. There were no docks along the river. We encountered many Miao people, dressed in strange clothes. Both men and women in the villages wrapped their heads in cloth, just like Indians.

Only a few domestic vessels still operated in inland ports that had not fallen. Apart from foreign vessels operating on the coastal routes, the rights to navigate the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang and the Yangtze River below Hankou have been completely seized by the enemy. According to statistics, Britain currently occupies the first position in terms of shipping vessels, XXX occupies the second position, and Norway occupies the third position. Details are as follows:

Starting in October, Guangzhou, Tingmen, Sanshui, and Wuzhou have completely suspended ship traffic due to the war. As for the coastal and river routes of China, (1) the Nanyang Line, including Shanghai-Ningbo, Shanghai-Guo, Shanghai-Min, Shanghai-Xiamen, Shantou-Hong Kong-Guangzhou, and the inland ports Shanghai-Taiwan, Shanghai-Ruiping, Shanghai-Xingquan, Ningbo, Ding, Xiang, Taiwan, Ou, Min, Quan, Xiamen, Shantou, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Macau, Hai, Wuzhou, and other sections; (2) the Beiyang Line, including Shanghai-Hai, Shanghai-Qing, Shanghai-Tianjin, Shanghai-Xing, Shanghai-Ying, Shanghai-An, and other sections, and Qingdao-Lianyungang, Yantai-Longkou, Tianjin-Qinhuangdao, Yingkou-An, and other subsections; (3) the Yangtze River Shanghai-Hankou Line, and the downstream routes, such as Shanghai-Chongming, Shanghai-Hai, Shanghai-Qi, Shanghai-Yang, and other sections. The domestic vessels on the above three major shipping routes have been cut off and are completely occupied by foreign vessels. The inland ports that were previously prohibited to foreign vessels are now exclusively navigated by foreign vessels. Only a few domestic vessels are still operating on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and various inland ports.

### A Visit to the Paris Wax Museum

— Zhizheng

I remember when I was a teenager, I read a very moving article in a textbook, which was "A Record of Observations at the Paris Oil Painting Exhibition" by Xue Fucheng. It described an oil painting of the Franco-Prussian War in the Paris Wax Museum, depicting the miserable situation of France's defeat at that time, with the intention of arousing the people's patriotic and vengeful emotions. That was the general idea; I have forgotten the detailed content. Although I was very young at that time and could not fully appreciate the purpose of this article, the term "Paris Wax Museum" left a deep impression on me. This time, when I arrived in Paris, I asked my friends how to get there. My friends said, "Are you influenced by Xue Fucheng's article?" I said, "Exactly." It turns out that eight or nine out of ten Chinese people in Paris go there because of this article. An article has left people with an impression that has produced an incredible magic. It can be seen how deep the influence of words is.

The wax museum is located at 10 Boulevard Montmartre. This area is a hub of entertainment venues in Paris, somewhat like the Fei Lu Road in Shanghai. The wax museum occupies a small corner of it. The wax museum is called Musée Grévin in French, in memory of its founder, Grévin. After entering the museum, I bought an entrance ticket for eight francs. The light inside was dim. The first thing that caught my eye was a film company's shooting scene. The director was directing the filming. One of the characters on stage was relatively familiar, it was Krétai Gaza. The second room contained contemporary French celebrities, such as Launbre, Dalady, etc. Other famous aviation figures and sports masters from various countries also occupied separate rooms. The fifth room was a shocking depiction of the Spanish war. Government troops were resisting in a church. Two people were holding rifles, one person was setting up a machine gun, and two other people were already lying on the ground, dying. There were also two large clocks hanging in the church. The scene was realistic, and the expressions were lifelike, making people think of the cruelty of the Spanish Civil War. After seeing them, I thought of my own country and couldn't help but feel endless emotions.

The important figures on the world political stage selected by the wax museum included only the contemporary dictators Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin. Other figures such as US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Chamberlain were not selected. Perhaps the wax museum believes that only these three giants dominate the current world. Stalin was smoking a pipe, Mussolini was raising his hand, and Hitler was tightening his belt, each with a different expression. Recently, an Italian tourist went to Mussolini's statue and, because he hated him to the extreme, committed suicide with a gun at the foot of the statue. It can be seen how much stimulation the wax museum gives to people.

Because the British Emperor was coming soon, the wax museum also added new statues of the British Emperor and Empress. This can be regarded as a timely embellishment. In addition, downstairs there are interior scenes of fashion stores and performances by famous actors. However, what is more worth seeing is a pair of hands of the great writer Hugo. These hands are carved from white stone, with a handwritten letter from Hugo to Grévin and a quill pen that he used during his lifetime attached to the side. The basement is mostly about revolutionary stories, full of prisons, killings, and court scenes. The fire is flickering, which is eerie and terrifying. This is probably what is called the "Reign of Terror"! The famous Madame Roland is also on trial. Madame Roland has a famous saying, which is: "Liberty, liberty, how many crimes are committed in thy name." She is of course also a victim.

There is also a realistic depiction of the place where the French tyrant Louis XVI was imprisoned. There is also an original copy of the confession of guilt issued by Louis XVI on December 25, 1792, posted on the side. He was killed on January 20, 1793. There is a picture (not a wax statue) depicting the scene at the guillotine very clearly. The body is separated from the head, and blood is splattered everywhere. This is the end of a generation of tyrants. There are many other wax statues depicting French history. There is also a place that explains the important events in Jesus' life, divided into five rooms. Because there was not much time, I did not have time to look at them one by one.

In addition to wax figures, it also retains many important documents and historical materials. I saw a notice signed by General Calleni, saying, "The government is now moving west. I am ordered to defend Paris and will certainly obey the order and swear to never change. I hereby announce this." A few words fully express the scene of panic in Paris that day. The date of the notice is September 3, which I think was in 1914. Another notice, issued after the German army occupied Liège, says, "After our army arrived here, we have shot 110 bad people. If anyone else does not obey our army's orders, they will be shot without mercy." The wording is arrogant, and it is not difficult to imagine the ferocity of the German army at that time and the mood of the French people to resist. There is also a place where war trophies seized from Germany during the Great War are displayed, including the lead remains of a Zeppelin. During the Great War, the German Zeppelin airship dropped many bombs over Paris. This is the most unforgettable thing for the people of Paris to this day.

I walked around the hall for a while and saw a woman sitting on the corner of a long chair (which is for tourists to sit on), and an old man sitting and reading a newspaper. I didn't pay much attention to them. Later, after walking around in a circle, they were still sitting there. I was very tired from walking, so I also sat down next to them, intending to chat with the old man reading the newspaper. But when I looked closely, it turned out that he was also a wax figure. Looking at the woman again, she was also not a real person. This is a novel thing that cannot be seen in the London Wax Museum, because I would suspect that there are wax figures on the tourist seats as well. I looked around carefully again and suddenly found a soldier sitting upstairs on the railing, smiling and looking down, and a caretaker who was sleeping soundly, all wax figures. So, it is necessary to be very careful to distinguish between truth and falsehood.

While I was watching with fascination, the bell suddenly rang loudly, indicating that the magic show and the Crystal Palace attached to the wax museum were about to begin. Everyone swarmed upstairs and first entered a small theater, where a magician performed several magic tricks. After each magic trick was completed, he told the audience all the contents. Finally, he advised customers to buy his book so that they could practice themselves. It seems a little out of scope for the wax museum to have a magic show. Moreover, what is performed is also very ordinary. After about fifteen minutes, the magic show was over, followed by the Crystal Palace. Tourists arrived in a room with glass on all sides, decorated with various lights, sometimes red, sometimes green, sometimes many, sometimes few. So, when people are in the room, they see thousands of lights reflected in the glass. A burst of darkness mixed with the rumbling of thunder, indicating that it was raining. There were also displays of snowfall, various different situations, all using lights to show them. Although there is not much meaning, it is indeed quite interesting for children to come and see. They can also think of the application of optics, which is of considerable benefit to enlightening children's wisdom. The magic room and the Crystal Palace are open about every two hours. This can be regarded as an extra article of the wax museum. The oil painting of the Franco-Prussian War mentioned by Xue Fucheng has long been replaced. The things it displays are often changed. The battle of the Great Wall, which was displayed last year, is no longer there. In the twilight, I left the Paris Wax Museum, which left a deep impression on me, and stepped back onto the bustling Montmartre Street.

### Occupation of China's Textile Industry

Since Japan restricted the export of cotton products to China in order to retain its ability to obtain export foreign exchange (because it had integrated the monetary system of North China with the Japanese yen, Japan no longer receives export foreign exchange for exports to "North China." This means that Japan, which desperately needs foreign exchange, has no choice but to restrict exports to China in order to export to a second country, or to restrict its domestic textile production by restricting exports, thereby restricting the import of its weaving raw materials in order to save its import foreign exchange. For increasing foreign exchange, the paths are different, but the goals are the same), the textile markets of the Northeast, "North China," "Central China," and "South China" have experienced a surge in prices. For example, 20-count yarn in the Northeast has reached 490, and Tianjin and Shanghai are also approaching 300 yuan. However, the highest price in Japan is only 221 yuan. Therefore, Japanese textile capitalists all believe that investing in factories in China is profitable. With the support of the military, Japanese businesses have recently been very active in the textile industry in China. According to a survey by the Japanese Toyo Keizai Shimpo in early November, Japanese yarn spindles in various Chinese territories are arranged as follows. Of the yarn factories in Qingdao, most of the equipment was destroyed before the occupation. All of the above equipment has been installed this year and is scheduled to start operating in the spring of next year. Among them, the Guoguang Factory, formerly the "Huaxin Yarn Factory" run by Chinese businessmen, was reorganized by Nagasaki Guoguang Textile Co., Ltd. after being acquired for 2 million yuan. The Qingdao Toyota Yarn Factory was also among those destroyed. In addition to restoring some of the equipment, it also acquired a Chinese yarn factory in Binan (factory name unknown). In addition, there are countless Chinese yarn factories now run by Japanese yarn factories. According to the Japanese International Economic Weekly, Vol. 19, No. 5, the following Chinese yarn factories on the outskirts of Shanghai are now said to be "jointly operated with Japanese businesses."

Operated by Toyota

Operated by Shanghai Textile

Operated by Yufeng Textile

Operated by Zhongyuan Textile

Operated by Zhongwai Textile

Recent Statistics on Yarn Spindles in Japanese Yarn Factories in China (Number Existing on November 1 of this Year)

According to a survey by the Toyo Keizai Shimpo in early November, the Renfeng Yarn Factory in Jinan, the Daxing Yarn Factory in Shijiazhuang, the Jinsheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Taiyuan, and the Yufeng Heji Yarn Waste in Zhangde are now all operated by Zhongyuan. The equipment of each factory before the war is as follows:

### Chinese Representatives Luo Xuhuo and Others Agree to Assist in Deferring Delivery of Goods. The Import Goods Merchants Association was Informed Yesterday that They Would Exert Efforts on Their Behalf and Will Conduct Amicable Consultations with the Chairman of the Western Merchants Association.

The Hong Kong Import Goods Merchants Association for piece goods, foreign goods, copper, iron, etc., in order to request Western merchants to defer the delivery deadline, after the second meeting the other day, wrote to Chinese representatives Luo Xuhuo and others for assistance. Yesterday, they received a reply from Representative Luo and others, agreeing to provide assistance. The original texts of the two letters are recorded below:

Letter: To whom it may concern, since Guangzhou was forcibly occupied by [omitted text], land and water transportation have been completely cut off. The members of our merchants association and others have ordered goods from various European countries from various foreign firms, the sales of which depend entirely on Guangzhou, accounting for a considerable amount. Although there are normally warehouse and silver periods, the contract deadline is easy to pass, but the resumption of transportation is uncertain. Our merchants association and others feel deeply about this difficulty and, on the first day of this month, jointly wrote to the Western Merchants Association requesting a deferral of the delivery date and exemption from warehouse rental interest. Subsequently, the association replied on December 16, stating: "Our association expresses great sympathy for the difficulties encountered by your members and other merchants due to the Japanese army occupying Guangzhou and other parts of South China and blockading the Pearl River waterway. However, the recent request you have made has been carefully considered by our association, and our members still believe it is difficult to implement. We are writing to inform you to inform your members to pay and collect goods on schedule, etc." As the end of the year is approaching and financial conditions are tight, the impact on our association and others is relatively light, while the impact on other businesses is significant. If the Western Merchants Association's reply, as stated, requires payment and collection of goods on schedule and is unwilling to be flexible, the financial situation in Hong Kong will inevitably become more serious. We have always admired your representatives' concern for overseas Chinese affairs and understanding of merchants' difficulties. We are now jointly requesting your esteemed assistance to help us overcome this difficult period. Our merchants association and others will be extremely grateful, and the commercial interests of Hong Kong rely on it. How to proceed is anxiously awaited. Respectfully addressed to Hong Kong Chinese Representatives Luo Xuhuo, Zhou Junnian, Luo Wenjin, and Li Shufen; Guo Quan of the Puyi Merchants Association; Huang Liangshu of the Piece Goods Guild; Chen Jingtao of the Electrical Appliance Merchants Association; and Zhou Huaiyong of the Iron and Steel Merchants Association.

Reply: Respectfully replying, we have received your letter regarding the request of your association and others to the Western Merchants Association to defer the delivery date and exempt warehouse rental interest, requesting assistance. We are honored by your trust and will certainly exert our efforts. However, this matter is a mutually agreed procedure for trade between both parties and cannot be interfered with by government power. Currently, our representatives intend to conduct an amicable consultation with the chairman of the Western Merchants Association to observe the effects.

### The Great International Sympathy— French Respond to Our Debt Repayment Movement! Citizens Should Actively Participate!

Yesterday, a Frenchman named Mr. Bo visited the General Chamber of Commerce and donated two Hong Kong dollars in response to our country's recently launched one-dollar debt repayment movement. According to him, the Chinese people's launch of this one-dollar debt repayment movement shows the determination to support the government's war of resistance to the end and demonstrates China's ability to repay debts, renewing international perception. China is fighting for international justice and humanity, and for world peace, which is of great significance. Not only should China strive to support it, but peace-loving people around the world should also provide just support. My ability is limited, and this small donation only expresses a bit of sympathy.

### A Warrior Wounded by a Gun in the Fengtou Chung Refugee Camp Died Yesterday. The One Stabbed is Still in a Dangerous Period.

In the Matou Chung Refugee Camp in the peninsula, there are currently a thousand of our country's warriors stationed. The other day, two warriors were shot by Indian soldiers, one wounded by a gun and one wounded by a bayonet. Both were sent to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. Details were first seen in yesterday's newspaper. However, by about one o'clock yesterday morning, the warrior who was shot died due to severe injuries. Although the doctors tried their best to rescue him, they could not bring him back to life and he passed away. The injured warrior also suffered serious battle wounds and has not yet passed the danger period, but compared to the previous day, he has improved slightly. According to yesterday afternoon's De Chen Western Newspaper news, the deceased was named Ma Xiong, 40 years old, a soldier of the [omitted text] division [omitted text] brigade. According to the Indian army guarding the camp, the deceased left the camp privately that day and walked to the guard post, saying that he wanted to go out for a while. The guard soldier warned him not to. However, the deceased did not listen to him (perhaps due to language barriers), refused to return to the camp, and went past the guard post. The Indian soldier then fired a shot, hitting a vital point. The deceased was injured outside the camp. The Indian soldier then helped him back to the camp and reported to his superiors. After the incident, the soldiers in the camp rioted, but after explanation, there was no further incident.

### British Court Issues Medals, Four People in Hong Kong Receive Awards, Three Britons and One Chinese Employee.

The British government awards medals every New Year's Day to those who have contributed to the United Kingdom, regardless of whether they are British officials, civilians, or people of the colony. Yesterday, on New Year's Day, the British court issued awards as usual. A total of four people in Hong Kong received awards: (1) Henderson, Director of Public Works of the Hong Kong Government, received the O.B.E. Medal; (2) Mr. Qi, Manager of the Hong Kong Western Merchants Association, received the same medal as above; (3) Tilla, the current Chief Inspector of the Hong Kong Sanitation Bureau, received the M.B.E. Medal; (4) Song Dingwen received the I.S.M. Medal. It is reported that Mr. Song has worked in various agencies of the Hong Kong government for more than 20 years and recently retired due to old age. Before retirement, he was the Chief Clerk of the Hong Kong Medical Department.

### The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Instructs Chinese Merchants to Strictly Prohibit [omitted text] Goods. Those Who Purchase and Transport [omitted text] Goods Will Be Sentenced to Imprisonment or Fined. Impersonating [omitted text] Goods Will Be Sentenced to Death.

The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce here received an official document forwarded by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, attached with one copy each of the Regulations on Prohibiting [omitted text] Goods and the Regulations on Prohibiting the Transportation of Materials to [omitted text]. According to the main points of the Regulations on Prohibiting [omitted text] Goods, those who order [omitted text] goods and transport and sell [omitted text] goods will be sentenced to imprisonment of one to seven years and fined up to 5,000 yuan. According to the main points of the Regulations on Prohibiting the Transportation of Materials to [omitted text], those who provide materials to [omitted text] will be fined 1,000 yuan. Those who impersonate [omitted text] goods as national goods, and those who violate this regulation will be sentenced to death. It is also found that Hong Kong is the only market for the transportation and sale of [omitted text] goods in South China, and various piece goods account for the majority. Before the outbreak of the war, the total value of piece goods imported into Hong Kong was more than 10 million yuan per year, and [omitted text] goods accounted for half of it. After the July 7th Incident, although the members and employees of the Piece Goods Guild unanimously implemented the selection of goods movement, there were still many non-member members who secretly searched for and operated, so the effect was not as planned. It is also learned that in recent months, [omitted text] country's piece goods that have been transported to Hong Kong after changing the trademark have greatly increased again, such as Western wool, women's wool, thread velvet, ceremonial velvet, autumn velvet, and cool velvet. The estimated total value of winter goods alone is as high as 3 million to 4 million yuan. In addition to asking members in the east, the Piece Goods Guild cannot prohibit those who operate privately.

### The Journalists Association Issued a Declaration Yesterday, Supporting the Central Government's Resistance to the End, Opposing Wang's and All Pro-Peace Fallacies, and Requesting the Central Government to Eliminate Wavering Elements as Much as Possible.

The Hong Kong Chinese Journalists Association, because Wang Jingwei contradicted the development of the war of resistance in our country and issued a gaudy telegram, with absurd wording, which easily misled the world, specially held the third joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees yesterday, unanimously passed a resolution to support the central government's war of resistance to the end, oppose Wang Jingwei's pro-peace proposal, and decided to issue a declaration and condemn its absurdity. Details were seen in yesterday's newspaper. The declaration has been drafted and reads:

When the July 7th Incident occurred in Lugou Bridge, the central authorities solemnly declared and pointed out that

Once the War of Resistance has been launched, there is no reason to compromise midway. If we compromise midway, it will lead to destruction. This statement and this intention have been firmly and enduringly held by officials and people, both high and low. The reason is that [omitted text] people have a consistent policy towards our country's intrigue. If we firmly resist and wage a protracted war, we will not be able to eradicate their conspiracy. In the past ten months of the War of Resistance, our situation has gradually progressed to a certain stage. Recently, the [omitted text] army suffered heavy casualties, reorganized and replenished, and was unable to invade. The international atmosphere has also undergone a clear change, expressing unusual goodwill towards us. Therefore, if we can continue to persevere, we will surely make [omitted text] people yield. If at this time, we spread rumors of peace talks and generate the wrong idea of compromise, it will be enough to shake the foundation of the country and act as a tool for [omitted text]. We must strongly refute it and not allow it to spread and confuse public opinion. Recently, the [omitted text] magnate Konoe Fumimaro, due to his difficult situation, spread

a Smoke Screen of Peace. Considering his true intention, it is not only absurd and outrageous, but also insidious and cunning. Our central leaders have severely condemned it one by one, exposing his conspiracy and cunning to the fullest. Therefore, the so-called Konoe statement is merely a more poisonous and spicy trick used by [omitted text] people to invade us, in addition to military force. All Chinese patriots should deeply hate and detest it and see through his treachery. However, former Central Vice President Wang Jingwei suddenly left his post at this time, hid in a foreign land, and issued a proposal, responding to [omitted text] and speaking for [omitted text]. We believe that Wang's move is a reversal of history, shaking the foundation of the country. No matter how he conceives and phrases it, there is no truth in it. Moreover, Wang was also an important member of the party and the country in the past, and his words and deeds are most likely to be misunderstood. Now he suddenly has this

Betrayal of Public Opinion, An advocacy of undermining the war of resistance, which is not only sufficient to destroy his personal past history, but also sufficient to put the country in a state of eternal doom. We believe that Wang's so-called proposal is, in fact, an attempt to open the door to peace in East Asia, rather than to seek surrender to [omitted text] and to shake the entire advantage of the war of resistance and kneel before [omitted text] people. Moreover, the absurd statement of the [omitted text] cabinet has been severely criticized by Chairman Chiang one by one, and the true intention has been exposed. Even a three-foot-tall child can see through his treachery, so there is no need for Wang's advice. Since Wang is an important member of the Central Committee, he cannot be said to be unaware. However, he deliberately embellishes

Reversing Black and White, Sima Zhao's Heart. It is difficult to discuss where to go and what to do. Yesterday, the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees discussed and determined that "Wang's actions are a clear violation of discipline and harm to the party and the country. In the face of justice, we cannot tolerate it. We declare that we will immediately and permanently expel him from the party and remove him from all his duties." We believe that this move by the Central Committee is decisive. All nationals must absolutely support it. At the same time, we believe that Wang's betrayal of the party and the country and his reversal of history is the most unfortunate situation in the course of the war of resistance. However, from [one/another?] perspective, it actually makes our war of resistance situation clearer. Therefore, from now on, our country's war of resistance will inevitably be more confident than before. At this time, we must be of one heart and one mind and support the Central Committee's

Policy of Resistance to the End, in order to achieve the final victory. Apart from this, we must severely attack any rumors of peace talks and any wrong ideas of compromise, so as not to spread them. At the same time, we deeply oppose Wang's pro-peace [argument], and we must also deeply oppose any so-called pro-peace fallacies of anyone. We believe that in this dangerous situation in our country, there is only one way to survive, that is, to resist to the end and persevere to the end. We support the central authorities'主張, and we will never compromise midway. As this resolute war of resistance takes on an increasingly明期形狀, we respectfully hope that the central authorities will take this opportunity to further renew [military?] structure, rectify discipline, and eliminate all corrupt elements and cowardly soldiers who are enough to shake the war of resistance, so as to thank the people of the country and calm public opinion, and to make the war of resistance front more嚴整, and [ensure that] after the final victory, we can achieve our goal. This is our sincere hope. This declaration.

### May the Blood of the Dead Wash Away the Stains of Politics.

— Qi Zhuo

A Record of the Memorial Service for Ye Duanren. Hong Kong Social Organizations Will Appeal to the Guangdong Authorities to Rectify Discipline.

Wreaths, elegiac couplets, simply and plainly exuding an atmosphere of grief and solemnity. Yesterday afternoon at one o'clock, hosted by the Chinese Arts Advancement Association, the cultural circles and social organizations of Hong Kong mourned the death of Mr. Ye Duanren with great sorrow.

Originally, Ye Duanren was a standing director of the association. He had served in the Hong Kong news industry for many years and was a very progressive young writer. Several months ago, he led a Hong Kong Xijiang Seven County Association service [back to our] country delegation to Xijiang area to engage in national salvation work and made great efforts. Recently, at the invitation of the Yunfu County People's Self-Defense Corps Discipline Council, he served as the corps' political instructor. In mid-last month, while on official business from Yun[fu] to Xinxing, during the [omitted text] machine's wanton bombing, local illegal soldiers took the opportunity to loot Mr. Ye's property and killed him to silence him, and he died.

The Chinese [Arts Advancement] Association, Xijiang Seven County Association, Printing Workers Union, Nanyang Overseas Chinese Save-Our-Hometown Association, Huining Association, and fellow members of the China Bookstore, as well as Mr. Du Qi, Zhang [omitted text] and others, all sent sorrowful and tragic elegiac couplets. Like the [couple] of the Association fellow members:

"The nation has reached the final juncture, gathering overseas talents, requesting [to enlist and] returning to the country to lead the vanguard. Who would have thought that the heavenly duty would not be completed and the name buried in the mountains, and not be obliterated; the war is only a transitional phase, awakening the masses in the country, raising their sleeves to resist [omitted text], who would be willing to fall behind. Take advantage of this increasingly tempered public sentiment, and wipe out [omitted text] in blood in Guangzhou."

The elegiac couplets of the third branch of the Printing Workers Union and all the staff of the China Bookstore are also the most sincere expressions:

"Not dying under the guns of the [omitted text] people but dying at the hands of the Han traitors, when will the martyrs close their eyes?

Striving for the survival of the motherland, sacrificing for the liberation of the nation, loyalty and righteousness penetrate the clouds."

Mr. Ye's portrait was hung below the national flag and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen. He looked very young, clean, and kind. The national flag, highlighted by the black and white elegiac couplets and the simple wreaths, was even more鲜亮.

During the ceremony of silent mourning, the mourners all recalled with heartache that this was an epitome of a difficult era, and at the same time, they paid their highest respects to the more soldiers and fellow countrymen who died in the disaster.

Du Qizhang, chairman of the Arts Association, offered wreaths and asked questions. This eulogy also early touched people's hearts:

On January 3rd, the 28th year of the Republic of China, all members of the Hong Kong Chinese Arts Advancement Association respectfully offer 生花 elegiac couplets to Comrade Ye Jun Duanren's [spirit]:

For the survival of the nation and the people, you have been constantly拼命;

For the great cause of cultural construction, you have been constantly呼号!

Your one mouth, overthrown many shameless [omitted text] people.

Your one pair of strong legs, kicked away many卑污clowns.

Your one sharp pen,刺国 countless decadent败类.

Ah! You, you are a warrior of the nation, a pioneer of the cultural world!

Humanity, the nation, is in need of you, is looking forward to you, is looking forward to your efforts——success!

How could it be that that虐弹, which is hated by the entire Chinese nation, pierced through your chest and ended your great cause?

Now,烽火遍华南, just when you and us are about to step forward together, who knew that we would be weakened by you, this warrior!

We understand, now our chances of dying are many, you just happened to be the one who碰了 chance.

We understand, although you are dead, your spirit is eternal, your great cause has not stopped because of your death.

We swear before your spirit, we are willing to advance along your blood stains! To avenge you! Also for the struggle for the liberation of the entire nation!

Victory is getting closer and closer to us, please 含笑安 [rest]吧!

Soul, come back, discuss the rivers and mountains of the motherland!尚飨!

Mr. Pan Fan'an reported Mr. Ye's history with an atmosphere of grief and indignation. First, he narrated Mr. Ye's efforts to engage in cultural work in Hong Kong and the process of returning to the country to serve and [dying]難. At the end, he put forward Mr. Ye's advantages to encourage the dead to imitate: one is to be興世无权利之争, but to fight for truth and justice; second is to be enthusiastic about learning, society is the school; at the time of death, he was still holding a book.

Those who spoke were Huang Chuqing, Feng Jinchi, and Yu Suo'ya, representatives of the Chinese Arts Association; Mr. Lin Guangfu, a representative of the Printing Industry Union, and many representatives from other social organizations. The representative of the Huining Association spoke with tears streaming down his face. The atmosphere of the venue became even more凄楚.

Mr. Lu Fu's speech also aroused people's resonance very passionately. He said: (1) Death is originally a very ordinary thing; bloodshed and sacrifice are also the price that must be paid to win victory. However, now that the war of resistance has reached its most serious and tense moment, when the country most needs him to work, he should not have died. (2) Mr. Ye is usually very 绒默, in fact, some people笑 his courage is not enough. However, he has now bravely returned to the country to participate in the war of resistance, and even more bravely sacrificed for participating in the war of resistance. We friends who stay in Hong Kong feel ashamed and悲痛. (3) It has been a year and a half since the war of resistance, but the political institutions have not been improved, and political education is still 万分不够, which has an extremely great impact on the entire future of the war of resistance. Mr. Ye did not die under the guns of the [omitted text] people, but died寃 at the hands of his own illegal soldiers. Although Mr. Ye's personal misfortune makes us十分同惰 with lament, the reason for the 寃 death - the lurking of the political crisis in the wartime rear - is a serious problem that we must never ignore and that urgently needs to be improved with the greatest strength.

After the speech, it was followed by悲憤地,热烈地 discussion. As a result, in addition to resolving to organize a memorial committee to engage in condolence to the family and collect literary works, it was also decided to unite Hong Kong groups and appeal to the new chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government to severely punish the murderers, [and] 卹恤 the families of the dead. And it is necessary to actively rectify the network of discipline and protect the定全 of overseas Chinese returning to the country to serve.

Spent three or four hours participating in this solemn,悲憤的 memorial service. On the way back, I silently wished that the blood of Mr. Ye would wash away the stains of politics. - A glimpse of the city

### Huizhou Growing from the Ashes of War: A Travelogue of Returning to Huizhou, Part Four

I. A Glimpse of the City

[Special Travel Correspondent for This Newspaper] Huizhou is now under the radiance of the Blue Sky White Sun flag.

The recovery of Huizhou, according to various investigations, occurred as follows: During the days of the Japanese withdrawal, the small number of compliant residents in the city were prohibited from entering or leaving. On December 7th, residents near Dongxin Bridge were ordered to relocate to Zhongshan Park, fearing they would be subjected to torture, slaughter, or burning. They were concentrated and imprisoned in the Zhongshan Memorial Hall, terrified and pale, looking at each other. Afterward, several loud explosions shook the earth, revealing the destruction of Dongxin, Jinxiu, Weitong, and other bridges. That night, the Japanese quietly withdrew, taking several Italian and German missionaries with them and burning three to five vehicles for their own use. Self-defense teams from villages such as Fucheng and Huangdong, upon learning of the Japanese withdrawal, entered the city led by team leaders Huang Shulan and Huang Zhisan. However, before the self-defense teams arrived, the city's criminals also learned of the news, colluding with local bandits to enter the city and plunder extensively. As a result, the section of Shuidong Road near Guangdu Hall in the county town and the section near Tongrentang in the prefectural city, businesses that had not been burned by the Japanese, were set ablaze by the bandits. Many valuables that had survived the Japanese looting were taken by the bandits. These two major catastrophes turned Huizhou into a field of ashes. When the self-defense teams saw the sky-illuminating fire in the city, they rushed to encircle and attack, and the bandits fled in panic. The East River Guerrilla Headquarters and the 453rd Brigade also arrived in pursuit, taking full responsibility for local security. The enemy's retreat was quite secretive. If it had been discovered earlier, most of their "Imperial Army" would have been annihilated on the East River. According to the Guerrilla Headquarters' report, they were still ambushed by our guerrillas in Luofu Mountain and Futian, resulting in significant casualties. Huizhou amidst the flames has gained a partial redemption.

The desolate scene in Huizhou is heartbreaking for anyone who isn't emotionally numb. Over five hundred shops lined the winding Shuidong Road in the county town, but more than four hundred of them have been destroyed by fire. Broken iron gates, crumbling high doors, and charred beams are all the same, making it impossible to distinguish the names of the businesses. Standing among the rubble for a moment, one can smell a strong stench. Many emaciated dead cats and dogs, as well as the carcasses of pigs and chickens killed by the Japanese, litter the streets, mixed with moldy clothes from the shops, creating an unbearable odor. Several decaying human corpses remained in places like Huangtang Bridge and Gangbutou in the suburbs, submerged in water, and were only recently buried.

The fire-stricken area within the city is extensive. Shuidong Road, Xianyu Street, and Tangxia in the county town, along with Wanshi Road, Shizi Street, and part of Jindai Street in the prefectural city, totaling six hundred buildings, account for forty percent of the city's households and are the most commercially prosperous and luxurious areas. Alas, this is a special gift from the Japanese.

Public buildings, although not burned, are mostly in ruins. The Japanese seem to have an innate bestiality, and they love to turn the places we consider most solemn into their dirtiest haunts. The Zhongshan Memorial Hall in Huizhou Park, for example, was their stable. How can we wash away this shame? Even more painful is the Dongxin Bridge spanning the East River, which was over five or six hundred feet long and completed less than half a year ago. It made a heroic sacrifice along with the nation's misfortune, collapsing under the Japanese explosions. Now, the massive fragments lie overturned in the green waves, its majestic yet ruined form leaving people with sorrow and anger.

II. The Establishment of New Huizhou

Grieved by the nation's devastation and the loss of their homes, many citizens returning to their hometowns have a renewed will and determination. They are resolved to resist the Japanese and build a new world from the ashes. Tianyuan, Huibo, and many other teahouses and shops have reopened for business. Others, without complete storefronts, are conducting business by setting up tables and chairs on the streets. Many small vendors from the villages are also present. Shizi Street is unusually bustling from dawn to dusk every day, but prices are high, and supplies are scarce. The Post-War Relief Committee, jointly established by various party, government, and military sectors, has also emerged, with specialized committees for pacification, relief, sanitation, and other matters.

Naturally, after a major catastrophe, the environment is different from that of peacetime. During peacetime, various tasks had existing institutional foundations to follow, and private wealth could be utilized to facilitate implementation. However, after the catastrophe, the people are exhausted, and their wealth is depleted. Moreover, many old systems have been destroyed. In this chaotic and depleted state, effective and enlightened officials and dedicated local individuals must work together; otherwise, it will be difficult to achieve results. The future of the Post-War Relief Committee will be determined by this.

Disorder is almost a universal phenomenon in post-war areas. From a military perspective, the city of Huizhou currently houses self-defense teams, guerrilla forces, volunteer armies, and regular troops from the ××× Division and ××× Brigade, totaling several thousand people. Armed civilians wearing plain clothes, carrying short guns, and wearing armbands can be seen everywhere. Recently, they have been dispatched to various districts. The disorganization of the troops has significantly impacted local security. At the very least, it allows bandits to impersonate military personnel and seize opportunities to commit crimes. Therefore, the unification and reorganization of the guerrilla forces are essential to strengthening their power. On the 27th, when this reporter met with Luo Fengxiang, the guerrilla commander of the × District, Commander Luo also expressed insightful theories and concrete measures, which will be detailed in a later report.

After continuous arson, both the residents in the occupied city and the newly returned citizens are qualified to be called disaster victims. Although they have shattered homes, they lack clothing and food. Families of several people huddle at dilapidated doorways, creating a new picture of refugees. Fortunately, the government and local authorities are conducting relief work, and a provincial comfort delegation arrived a few days ago. Three porridge distribution centers have been set up at Zhongshan Park, County No. 1 Middle School, and Liudu Temple, each serving two to three thousand people daily. Watching them carry their worn-out bamboo baskets, the elderly supported by the young, the strong carrying the children, walking step by step on the rubble without a sound, with tears streaming down their faces, forming a long line, one cannot help but feel a pang of heartache. However, the children of the Chinese nation grow up in hardship. We cannot sigh, we cannot weep, we can only use our own blood and strength to create a new world, a new Huizhou.

Huizhou, 27th

### Go to the Occupied Areas!

— Longxi

Currently, in many occupied areas, the Japanese are working to eliminate Chinese culture. The steps are to first eliminate Chinese history, then all Chinese books, and finally eradicate the Chinese language. The means are vicious, needless to say, but the main question now is how to crush the Japanese conspiracy. Some advocate using "guerrilla-style written propaganda" to ensure that "the people remain even if the land is lost." I believe this is a passive method, at best only preventing the people in the occupied areas from becoming Japanese slaves temporarily. The active method, however, is how to prevent the Japanese from occupying the land, or at least, preventing them from benefiting from it, even preventing them from resting peacefully. What is this method? It is to strengthen the resistance capabilities of the occupied areas.

We have seen that after our repeated expressions of resistance to the end, never ceasing the war, the enemy has also made similar statements about a "long-term war." I dare say they have already implemented it. How? Simply put, it is to use Chinese manpower and resources to support the Japanese military invasion of China, which is what the Japanese call "using Chinese to control Chinese." The most concrete and ruthless means are nothing more than levying taxes and conscripting soldiers on the spot, and developing resources. In this way, the Japanese can sit high up, watching the Chinese nation commit suicide with guns and knives. For the Japanese, this is very pleasant, but for us who are suffering, we only need to think about the sight of puppet troops being driven to the front line to feel a chill down our spines. Moreover, today we can see puppet troops in the Northeast, and who knows if puppet troops will not appear in Suwan Xin in the future? Since the Japanese have already started conscripting soldiers and levying taxes in these areas, naturally there is no reason not to use them. When the enemy uses large numbers of puppet troops and a large amount of Chinese resources to fight a war of attrition with us, our long-term resistance will naturally be affected by such ruthless means.

However, the main reason why the situation is like this is that there are few people in the occupied areas who can confront the Japanese; otherwise, they would never let the Japanese do whatever they want. As far as I know, when the provinces of Hebei and Shandong were occupied, many passionate young people stayed there. Later, most of these people mobilized many people who were unwilling to be slaves and formed a formidable guerrilla force. In Shanxi, due to the efforts afterward, there were even better results. In the past two months alone, the Japanese military casualties in Shanxi alone have been no less than 20,000, and good news is also frequently reported from various parts of Hebei and Shandong. In short, in the lost lands, the provinces where the anti-Japanese work is done diligently are the places where the Japanese feel the most pain: on the one hand, they must use strong forces to suppress them, on the other hand, they continue to suffer significant losses, and dreams of levying taxes, conscripting soldiers, and developing resources are impossible to realize.

From this, we can see the importance of guerrilla work. I hereby hope that young people with ambition, when they have no opportunities to study or other work opportunities, should go to the occupied areas. Because there are still not many people who see this point, the responsibility of the few who have seen it is particularly heavy. As for the main principle of work, it is nothing more than making the Japanese always have to use a large number of troops to maintain the smallest occupied area, so that they cannot rest peacefully for a moment, and at the same time, they do not get the slightest gain. In this way, the progress of the Japanese military only increases their own pain and increases their own burden, and at the same time reduces the power of aggression. Therefore, the more frantic the aggression, the closer the collapse period.

Therefore, I finally want to repeatedly shout: "For the survival of the country and the nation, for the continuation of thousands of years of history, I hope that young people who currently do not have suitable jobs will go to the occupied areas!"

### New Year's Sentiments

— Tao Xingzhi

On New Year's Eve, I wish I could offer sacrifices to the new Qin Hui and visit Grandma Zhao (Note 1) for New Year's greetings. It is gratifying that Yiping became a national shield (Note 2), throwing out the golden bracelet to kill the demons.

Note 1: Grandma Zhao is Zhao Hongwenguo, the mother of the guerrillas, who recently went to Nanyang. She is a simple country woman who, unwilling to be a slave of a conquered nation, abandoned her family, sacrificed everything, and led three generations of her children and grandchildren to fight guerrillas. Her son Zhao Tong is now in various places in Northeast and Tianjin, and most of his troops are still intercepting the enemy.

Note 2: Li Yiping, a second-grade student at the Kowloon Chinese Children's College, is only eight years old. His family is not wealthy, but seeing the national crisis, he resolutely discussed with his parents to dedicate everything in his family to the country. The first time was during the donation campaign in 1937, when he donated his mother's life savings—a golden bracelet. The second time was during the Double Tenth Festival last year, when all sectors of society solicited winter clothes, and he donated 50 cotton-padded clothes. The student has also made the most efforts in various patriotic donations every month. The student's patriotic enthusiasm is commendable, and this is enough to prove that the people's hearts are not dead, and China will not perish; and it shows that the next generation of citizens will be able to shoulder the heavy responsibility of revitalizing the country and the nation. The president of the college, Wu Manzhenjun, encouraged all the students to take pictures with the student and gave him the name Guoping. Xinding

### A Story of Bumping into a Wall with a Manuscript

— Xinding

Since my hometown—Guangzhou—fell, I have been living the life of a refugee, wandering in the refugee camps for more than a month. By chance, I wandered to this island in the south.

Thanks to the care of friends whom I met briefly, I was spared from being sent to a refugee camp. Every day, I felt like a piece of duckweed moving on the water with the wind. When I met a friend who took care of me, I would stay overnight at their home. The next morning, I would drag my pair of worn-out leather shoes, which had traveled 2,500 li on the Long March, and move with the wind again.

However, "This is not a solution after all!" My friends began to think for me: "Why don't you write something? It doesn't cost any capital."

"Yes, how could I forget my pen?" So I started to try this business without capital, for I still want to live, live to prepare to return to the motherland to serve. I had a small wish—to make a living by writing.

I spent two nights writing the details of my escape on the Long March in a small attic surrounded by the sound of "mahjong," a long piece of ten thousand words. There were several special features that had not been published in general newspapers: the police and citizens fleeing in panic, the explosion of the cement factory, the photos of the refugees on the Guangsan Road, the unprecedented grand situation in Foshan, the brave resistance of the conscripted men of Guanshan, the fire disaster in the southwest... I thought that with such novel, detailed, and moving content, plus segmented subheadings, even if the length was short, it would be convenient to publish it in installments. The newspaper would definitely welcome it. Coincidentally, a friend said that he had a friendly relationship with the × newspaper and could send it on my behalf. So this long article was sent out like a giant ship launching in the arms race of the great powers. However, I don't know whether this delivery was sent to the Atlantic or the Pacific. I turned over the × newspaper every day, but I couldn't find my "masterpiece." After asking around through friends of friends, the answer was, "It's too long to be published." The manuscript was not returned. Since this road was not open, and I also received guidance from local friends, who advised me to write something "soft," "interesting," and "short," I read the newspaper supplements for a few days, and sure enough, this was true. However, I remembered that a "predecessor" writer seemed to have said that "learning to write" might as well start with trivial things around you. Doesn't this sentence coincide quite well with the above conditions? So I changed my "style," racked my brains, bit my pen, smoked cigarettes, and recalled the ridiculous corruption and incompetence of the party officials and masters before ×× was lost, and immediately described it in a "relaxed" and "humorous" tone, creating a memoir of about two thousand words, and submitted it to a newspaper that everyone watched, with a half-page supplement. After a day, it was actually "selected"; but the matter was a bit strange, what was published was not the supplement I submitted to, but a certain weekly magazine edited by a certain association, but since his territory was open, and the article had become a commodity anyway, why bother to insist on choosing a customer?

The next day, I saw a new solo drama script appear in a certain newspaper. After reading it, I had quite a bit of feeling, so I immediately wrote a script criticism, also about two thousand words, and sent it to a certain supplement, which was published the next day.

Ah, thanks to God, I can actually maintain my life by relying on the pen that is unique to us cultural people, this is such a happy thing! Estimating my bald pen, in addition to the needs of the rice bowl, I can also buy a pair of soft-soled shoes to replace my pair of broken shoes that have already traveled 2,500 li on the Long March.

Thinking of this, my thoughts seemed to suddenly open up. I also remembered that a certain predecessor writer seemed to have said that to quickly become a literary dragon, you must write more and submit to various publications in order to "become famous." So my head—a small article manufacturing plant—opened night work and increased production efficiency, and new goods were produced every day, and articles were sent to various newspapers every day. But after a week, the products of our factory were returned one after another. Some were stamped with a stamp: "Please prepare an envelope with a stamp," some used a red pen to write a few big characters: "Please send another masterpiece," and some went away like the Yellow Crane, and there was no trace.

A basin of cold water was poured on the top of my head. I silently calculated that the two manuscripts that had been published had been more than a month ago, and I quietly walked to the manager's office of the newspaper and carefully asked if there were any royalties to be paid. "Yes," the manager opened the registration book very enthusiastically and checked, asked for the title and pen name, took out five jiao from the big bag and put it on the table, handed over the receipt and asked me to stamp and sign it. I asked in surprise: "More than two thousand words, only five jiao?" "This five jiao is the royalty for the ×× drama criticism, as for the publication in a certain association's weekly, there is no royalty," he replied very naturally, and handed over the pen at the same time.

Helpless, I signed, stamped, and took the five exquisite jiao, my psychology was like being a humiliated diplomat, signing a humiliating treaty of selling myself.

The royalties received and the expenses for writing the manuscript, such as manuscript paper, stamps, envelopes, and ink, were compared, and the "capital" that was lost was twice as much as the income. The hope of making a living by selling articles finally became a gust of wind.

The result of the high development of capitalism is that from free competition to monopoly. Cultural people growing up in this society are not even qualified to be commodities.

### Starting from Theory

— Ziyou

Many people have talked about theory and practice, but I always feel that there is something more to say. Because people who often talk about theory seem to forget to explain the meaning of practice to themselves. This is really strange.

Joseph said: "Everyone knows that theory, if it is really theory, will give practitioners the power to determine direction, see the future clearly, have confidence in their work, and have faith in the victory of our cause." This sentence is very thorough, like a mirror that exposes monsters, revealing the true form of a group of counterfeit theorists and giving a talisman to true theory.

Mr. Lu Xun once said: "If you really know the way, you would have already moved towards your goal, why are you still acting as a teacher?" Although he meant to scold those empty heads who claimed to be youth mentors, of course, he did not mean that all youth mentors really did not know the way; but we can also use this sentence to illustrate those empty-headed revolutionaries who claim to be advanced and understand theory.

Really, if they really understood the theory, had confidence in their theory, they would have already moved towards the goal they wanted, why would they be leisurely in "Shangri-La, a safe haven" (?) of Hong Kong, or a more comfortable and safe big city, writing articles, talking about theory, and explaining practice to others.

Of course, we do not mean that we do not want theory, because "without revolutionary theory, there can be no revolutionary action." Theory is the compass of action, and at the same time, it must be enriched in practice. But what we want is not a theory that only calls on others to practice, but a theory that we must also practice ourselves.

There are many phenomena of talking about "theory and practice" without practicing oneself, which has its historical and social roots, and we cannot completely blame those who talk about theory.

Due to the limitations of the times, the immaturity of various political, economic, and social conditions; so that many theories can only be talked about, and only stop at talking about. After all, people's energy is limited. Naturally, due to the harshness of the current environment, many things will not be as easy to carry out as we imagine.

Taking our friends who talk about theory but do not practice as an example, due to the superiority of their living environment, their determination is shaken; at the same time, because the development of the objective political situation is far behind the development of the military and the enrichment of personal subjective understanding, they can only painfully stop at the stage of "theory."

But even in the worst environment, there is a minimum way to do things in the worst environment. Otherwise, there is no such thing as "practice" in the world, let alone the connection between theory and practice.

### Literary Criticism in 1938

— Lin Huanping

I.

Regarding the literary criticism circle last year, we can roughly divide it into the following issues for investigation:

1. The issue of utilizing old forms
2. General discussion on anti-Japanese war literature and art
3. Basic issues of literary theory
4. Research on the life, art, and thought of Mr. Lu Xun

II.

After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War the year before last, the aggressor's artillery fire burned my country's cultural palace—Shanghai, and the literary criticism circle was quite chaotic: some talked about sad literature; some advocated that the changes in domestic class relations were too fast, and writers could not grasp reality, and works could not be produced; some also shouted about the poverty of form and the difficulty of publishing: all kinds of things, the literary world was floating. But soon after, all these problems were given practical answers by the literary and art circles' life practice and creative practice.

After the literary world stabilized its position slightly, the central issue that was discussed, and is still being hotly discussed today, although there is already a roughly consistent conclusion, but still lacks a concrete implementation plan, is the issue of popularization of literature and art—the issue of utilizing old forms.

Although the issue of popularization of literature and art is not exactly the issue of utilizing old forms. But the center of the issue of popularization of literature and art that we discussed this year is actually the issue of utilizing old forms.

The most people have expressed their opinions on this issue. Roughly divided into three factions:

The first faction advocates unconditional use of old forms

The second faction advocates critical use of old forms

The third faction opposes the use of old forms

The first faction's argument believes that Chinese culture is backward, and the masses are close to old-style literature and art, and new literature and art are incompatible with them. Therefore, if we want to conduct anti-Japanese war propaganda, we can only use old forms unconditionally, as long as we put new wine—anti-Japanese war content—in old bottles.

The second faction argues that old forms have many feudal elements that are very strong and are too harmful to the masses. Moreover, they are fundamentally too far apart from the intense anti-Japanese war content and are incompatible and cannot be used. We should only critically use those old forms that can be used, and as for those old forms that are too feudal, we should not use them. At the same time, when we use old forms, we are actually injecting fresh blood into old forms, so that they can play the role of sublimation and evolution, gradually changing the nature of the forms being used and becoming new things. We believe that this theory is correct; we are advocates of this faction.

Finally, the third faction's theory believes that the New Literature Movement after the May Fourth Movement was a literary revolution and a negation of Chinese old literature. New literature and art have struggled for twenty years to lay a barely stable foundation, and now it is time to move forward bravely. Once we advocate using the old forms of China in the past, is it not reversing the car, is it not negating the May Fourth New Literature Movement? This theory, on the surface, seems to be very grand and crowned, but in essence it is a very absurd and seemingly correct theory. Why? Because these people do not understand history and do not know the development of history. They do not know that the new society is born from the belly of the old society. Similarly, they do not know that new culture and new literature are born from the belly of old culture and old literature. New culture and new literature are the accumulation of the historical essence of old culture and old literature. Negating the old, does the new fall from the sky? It's just that we are not blindly adopting, but critically using and accepting. In addition, some people have proposed the idea of creating new forms to offset the theory of utilizing old forms. A deep analysis of this theory is nothing more than breathing out of the same nostril as the third faction, which believes that utilizing old forms is surrendering to old literature. No more details.

### Li Huitang Sends Letter: Plans to Invite Xu Chengji to Hong Kong for Charity Tennis Matches for Refugees

[Our Report] Mr. Xu Chengji, our country's top representative at the Davis Cup tennis tournament, has been studying in Europe for several years, and his tennis skills have greatly improved. The famous British player Austin was once defeated by him.

It is heard that Mr. Xu has rushed back from Europe to participate in the East Asian Tennis Championship held in Saigon. However, it is not yet certain whether Xu has arrived in Saigon.

One must look at him with new eyes after a separation of three days. If Mr. Xu does return to the East, he will surely make a great contribution to this East Asian Tennis Championship.

When the Hong Kong tennis players Cai Yongshan, Situ Bi, and others left for Vietnam on New Year's Day, Li Huitang asked them to hand-deliver a letter to Mr. Xu.

It is said that Li's letter inquires about Xu's willingness to come to Hong Kong for a visit. Xu is returning to Java immediately after the East Asian Tennis Championship. Therefore, Li intends to invite him to Hong Kong before he returns to Java to hold several charity tennis matches to benefit the refugees.

When Mr. Xu left the country, the crisis was not so deep. When he returns, the land will have changed. It is expected that when he receives Li's letter, he will be moved and may accept the invitation for the sake of raising relief funds. (Dong Lang)

### Shanghai Charity Football: Chinese United Team Loses After Initial Lead, Defeated 1-2 by Western United Team

[Shanghai Correspondence] The annual charity football match for the McKean Engineer Cup, between the Chinese United team and the Western United team, was held at the Recreation Ground on the afternoon of the 26th at 2:30 PM. The audience, consisting of over ten thousand Chinese and foreigners, surpassed even the excitement of the visit of the Corinthian team in mid-April. Although the northerly wind was strong, the atmosphere was fervent. Around 2:30 PM, the players from the Chinese and Western teams entered the field amidst applause. The Chinese team wore white jerseys, while the Western team wore yellow jerseys with black stripes. At 2:30 PM, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador, accompanied by Mr. Green, the chairman of the Western Football Club, and Secretary Mr. Speakman, entered the field to perform the opening ceremony. At the sound of the referee An Yisheng's whistle, the competition began. Relying on the sharpness of its forwards, the Chinese United team took the lead in the first half, when at 25 minutes, center forward Dai, receiving a clever pass from Jia Youliang, headed in a goal, taking a 1-0 lead. After switching sides, Western United's lucky general, Favan Xiao, scored two goals. The Chinese United team's counterattacks were ineffective, and they ultimately lost 1-2, turning victory into defeat. After the match, the British Ambassador, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, presented the prize on the spot. The splendid Cup was received by the captain of the Western United team, Ma Shan'er. The ticket revenue totaled over five thousand five hundred yuan.

Chinese United Team:

Zhou Dayun

Xu Chengxun, Zhuang Youren

Yun Fenglin, Li Yichen, Jiang Zhaoxiang

Wan Xianghua, Jiang Chao, Dai, Sun Jinshun, Jia Youliang

Western United Team:

Aikensen

Ma Shan'er, Ke Laituo

Simons, MacClune, Huishe He

Pi Qu, Luo Chailiao, Fulaise, Mike Gen, Favan Xiao

Chinese United Team Wins One Goal in the First Half

At exactly 2:30 PM, the British Ambassador kicked the ball, and the fierce battle began. The Chinese United team's initial attack was blocked, and the Western United team seized the opportunity to attack, but also without success. They alternately attacked and defended until the 24th minute, when Jia Youliang of the Chinese team launched an offensive and penetrated deep into enemy territory. He hooked the ball perfectly, and Dai headed it straight into the corner of the net. Aikensen was unable to save it, and Western United fell behind by one goal. The Chinese fans applauded and cheered. After gaining a goal, the Chinese United team's offensive became more intense. Wan Xianghua dribbled past Ke Laituo and made a short pass to "Iron Leg" Sun, who then passed it to Jiang Chao. Jiang was too eager, and the ball went wide. Soon after, Sun got a throw-in and passed it to center Dai, who turned and shot powerfully, but Ke Laituo blocked the shot. After the Chinese United team failed to score repeatedly, the Western United team became more active. Favan Xiao got a corner kick opportunity, which he took very well. Fortunately, Zhou Dayun jumped up and caught the ball. Pi Qu launched an attack from the wing and passed to Mike Gen, who shot at the goal. Zhou Dayun punched the ball out, but Favan Xiao caught up and kicked it. Zhou caught it again, turning danger into safety. Soon after, the Western United team attacked again, and Luo Chailiao shot from the penalty spot, but it went over the crossbar. By the end of the first half, the Chinese United team was leading 1-0.

Western United's Counterattack Results in a Tie

Switching sides and resuming the game, Western United attacked first, and Favan Xiao's shot was caught by Zhou Dayun. Li Yichen committed a foul, and Western United was awarded a free kick just outside the penalty area. Ma Shan'er of the Western United team took the free kick, but it went wide. The Chinese United team counterattacked and got a corner kick opportunity. Jia's kick was very well placed, and Dai lightly headed the ball, but it went inches wide. Wan Xianghua then took a long shot, but it also failed to score. Favan Xiao of the Western United team dribbled the ball and attacked, and Xu Chengxun failed to block him. Favan shot powerfully from 18 yards out. Zhou Dayun tried to block it with both hands, but the ball was too strong and bounced into the net. Western United pulled back a goal, tying the score at 1-1.

1-2, Chinese United Team Suffers a Fatal Blow

After gaining a goal, the Western United team's morale was boosted. Pi Qu got a free kick, but Fulaise's header failed to score. Ma Shan'er tried a long shot, which resulted in a corner kick. Zhou caught the ball, and seeing Luo Chailiao and Fulaise advancing together, he tried to throw the ball out, but it fell in front of the goal. Yun Fenglin defended and saved the situation, preventing a goal. After that, the Western United team's luck turned for the better. Favan Xiao attacked with the ball, and Xu Chengxun failed to block him. Favan lobbed the ball, and Zhou Dayun jumped up to save it, but the ball hit the crossbar and went in. This was exactly fourteen minutes after Western United tied. The Western United team then took the lead 2-1. The Chinese United team then launched a counterattack, but Western United defended tightly. Finally, Dai passed the ball to Sun, who passed it to Wan, but Wan missed a good opportunity and failed to tie the score. The fans sighed in disappointment. Less than a minute later, the whistle blew, and the Chinese United team suffered a defeat of 1-2.

The Skills of Both Teams Were Comparable

The strength of the two teams was comparable. The Chinese United team's defeat was due to the wrong formation. Li Yichen was placed in central defense, while Xu Chengxun was in the back, causing the midfield to lose contact and weakening the attack. Xu Chengxun was responsible for Favan Xiao scoring two goals. Zhuang Youren was transferred to the winning side, and the left side was also weakened. Zhou Dayun saved many dangerous shots and performed well. Sun, "Iron Leg,"'s passes were unique, and Dai's performance was also excellent. However, Jiang Chao and "Little Wan" could not connect and were ineffective. If Li Yichen were placed in the front, assisted by Sun and Dai, they could break through the center and defeat the enemy. The Western United team's goalkeeper was not as good as Dayun. The defender Ma Shan'er was old and not as strong as Ke Lai. The midfield line was very strong. If Mike Si Gan played, he would have been even better. The two wings, Favan Xiao and Pi Qu, were more active, but the three forwards lacked teamwork. Therefore, the game was very tense.

### Resistance and Sports

— Li Hui

During the resistance war, we in the sports community have been scattered in all directions, and the vitality of sports governing bodies (such as the China National Amateur Athletic Federation) has largely ceased. This is certainly a great misfortune. Upon closer examination, most of it is due to the environment, but one of the problems is that our country has not paid enough attention to universal and peaceful development. Now, except for a portion of comrades who are slightly active in the isolated island of Shanghai, the only place where sports can maintain a normal state is the paradise of Hong Kong. Here, due to the gathering of refugees and the continuous influx of talent, the dynamics of sports have become even more lively, making it the focus of the country. Fortunately, the sports community on the island is full of passionate people who clearly recognize their responsibilities. In the absence of major contributions, they can do their best to contribute what they can to the rear. Whether it is football, basketball, tennis, miniature golf, baseball, swimming, martial arts, track and field, table tennis, all kinds of sports, fundraising competitions are held again and again to raise money to buy bonds, purchase medicines, buy winter clothes, and provide relief to wounded soldiers and refugees. The amount of money raised by the sports community is astonishing. Among them, the "All-Hong Kong Sports Community Extraordinary Guard Duty Service Corps" organized by the South China Athletic Association is the most effective. Various football fundraising matches (although the author injured his leg last autumn, I followed the comrades and tried to contribute a little, participating in charity matches and never being absent, which is some consolation amidst my self-reproach), charity calligraphy and painting exhibitions, charity sales, water carnivals, track and field charity events, etc., the work patterns are endless, and the people in charge are also working tirelessly, giving the sports community and other sectors of society the most profound good impression. Other activities, such as the basketball team and swimming team's expedition to Southeast Asia, although they did not achieve the expected results, can be considered to have contributed to the fundraising efforts, doing their part to fulfill the rear's responsibilities.

In short, if everyone carefully studies "Sports and Resistance," they will find that there is a close relationship between them. Unless we abandon ourselves, there is nothing to say. Otherwise, if we are determined to resist for a long time, then we must promote the sports cause, improve sports organizations, and increase the effectiveness of sports. On the one hand, we can strengthen the national resistance forces, and on the other hand, through the justice of sports, we can eliminate the inferior qualities that are still prevalent in our country, such as gluttony, cowardice, selfishness, jealousy, laziness, and fear of death, and cultivate a healthy physique, the virtue of obedience, and the spirit of unity. These are the three essential conditions for resistance. When the final victory belongs to our country, there will be new and great constructions in many places in our country. At that time, if we do not have sound organization, sound spirit, and courage, how can we cope with and complete the arduous responsibilities of reviving the nation and rebuilding the country?

Finally, on the one hand, we hope that our country's authorities will see the importance of sports to the resistance war and its close relationship with the people, and achieve collectivization of national sports through military training (the methods and plans will be discussed in another article when the opportunity arises). But our compatriots in the rear should also recognize their responsibilities. In addition to working hard to save the country, they should also supplement the government's shortcomings, emphasize the development of sports, teach their children, and encourage their siblings to rise from decline and join together to make everyone have a strong spirit and courage to deal with the current situation. I am not talented, but I believe that resistance will be victorious and the country will be built, so I dare to shout to the overseas Chinese:

"The final victory belongs to us!" (The End)

### Strengthening Strength Through Training

— Wang Xuezheng

An athlete who wants to reach the peak must have great strength. Skill is secondary. Now we want to discuss the method of training strength. Strength is long-lasting power. If we lack long-lasting power when engaged in strenuous exercise, there is a risk of overexertion, which is not only not beneficial to health, but harmful, especially to the heart and lungs. The impact on skill is no less than that on health.

Long-lasting power and circulatory respiration are closely related. The heart and lungs are not only the main organs of these two systems, but also the main organs of the whole body. To train long-lasting power, one must first strengthen these two organs. People with unhealthy hearts or lungs must be cautious when engaging in exercises mainly for training long-lasting power. Proceed step by step from light to heavy, and never rush. In fact, as long as these two organs are strong, our long-lasting power will not be too far behind.

In addition, long-lasting power is also closely related to muscles, especially the limbs and arms. Many people, even though they have strong hearts and lungs, feel muscle fatigue or weakness in their legs or arms after running a few steps. This is not because they have excess energy but lack strength. Many people with great physical strength are also like this. Their great physical strength is often fleeting. This is entirely due to a lack of long-lasting power or endurance.

People with unhealthy hearts or lungs who want to train long-lasting power must do more easy and gentle exercises that focus on training the trunk. The so-called trunk is the chest, abdomen, waist, and back. Avoid strenuous exercise.

In addition, the most beneficial exercises for long-lasting power include running, walking, rope skipping, jumping, and various breathing exercises. These exercises are most suitable for people with healthy bodies. However, the most important thing is to proceed from light to heavy and never overexert. People who are not very healthy can also try these exercises, but they must be even more cautious.

Running and walking - these exercises are not only beneficial for long-lasting power, but also for the muscles of the legs. It is best to do them in the early morning. Reduce clothing as much as possible during exercise to avoid catching a cold. The spirit must be particularly invigorated and not be lazy or perfunctory, otherwise this bad habit will be developed when doing other exercises.

When doing other exercises, the hips are important. When practicing running and walking, hold a hand weight in each hand, first clenching tightly, then relaxing, one tight and one loose, until the end of the exercise. This can simultaneously train the wrists and develop the muscles of the forearm. (To be continued)

### Movies and Drama

Entertainment... Thundering Drums

Drums

An unprecedented production by Alexander Korda of England. The story is about Prince Asim (Sabhu), who seeks revenge for his father's murder and after Marjorie unintentionally saves his life, he reports the "rebellion" to the governor when Prince Gohr conspires to launch a major offensive. He even helps by beating the drums. When reinforcements arrive, the rebellion is crushed.

Two scenes in the performance are commendable: the celebration in the palace during the Holy Festival, which can simultaneously arrange the dark lines of the uprising, until the drums start, followed by a climax. When reinforcements arrive, the two sides engage in a mixed battle. It is easy to film vividly and naturally with well-equipped foreign facilities. Several war scenes are very exciting for the audience. The exterior scenes are very likely and very beautiful because they are in color.

As for the actors, "Sabhu" showed lovely acting skills in "The Elephant Boy," and is still excellent here. The female lead, Valerie Hobson, is a beautiful and talented British star.

Queen Theatre... If I Were King

If I Were King

Productions by producer and director Frank Lloyd, such as "Mutiny on the Bounty," were excellent and successful works on the screen, leaving the audience with an indelible good impression. According to critics, his recent work "If I Were King" is even more successful in every aspect than the aforementioned films.

The story takes place during the reign of King Louis XI of France. Paris is troubled by strong enemies outside and starving people inside. The central figure is a poet and rogue swordsman who is a prominent leader among the rioting people. He unintentionally kills one of Louis' enemies, and Louis, at the same time, makes a big speech, giving him full authority to manage the country for a week. During this period, he must drive the strong enemy out of the country, otherwise, he will be severely punished. With his courage and talent, after great struggle and effort, he defeated the strong enemy and won the heart of the princess.

The entire film is magnificent and resplendent, and all the characters are lively and energetic. Among the main actors, Basil Rathbone, who plays Louis XI, is particularly praiseworthy. The director did not treat the film too seriously, and the entire film is full of humor and wit. The story itself has a moving power, coupled with the director's hard work, excellent acting skills, lively plot, superb martial arts, and dignified costumes and sets, it is a success of a flawless work.

### US Congress Opens Yesterday - Considers Economic Retaliation Against Japan and Germany - Roosevelt Asks for Massive Military Expansion

[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] The 76th Congress will convene here tomorrow to discuss several extremely important issues. President Roosevelt's opening address will be read to Congress on Wednesday. It is reported that he will emphasize that in view of the deteriorating international relations of the United States, American military preparations should be strengthened. The speech will also specifically mention the President's "Western Hemisphere Defense" plan and the expansion of the Monroe Doctrine to promote joint defense matters among the American republics. It is expected that the US President will announce that in the coming years, this major defense responsibility will be mainly borne by the US Navy and Air Force. He will also request a large expansion of the existing military equipment plan. The US President may explain his views on the outward expansion of authoritarianism. Although he will not mention the three countries that signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, he will make the following statement: In view of Japan's efforts to control the Far East, Italy's expansion into the Mediterranean, Germany's desire for Eastern Europe and Ukraine, and the joint invasion of the South American market by the three countries and their attempts to seize political interests, the United States has no other way to go but to do its best to reorganize its military equipment within the scope that does not hinder its domestic economy.

[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] It is now known that the US government authorities intend to submit to Congress the fact that Japan has occupied Chinese territory and that Germany has discriminated against US trade within its territory. What actions will be taken afterward will depend on the strong expressions of Congressmen and the people of the whole country. If President Roosevelt does not feel that the whole country unanimously supports his actions, he will not exercise the presidential power stipulated in Section 338 of the 1930 Tariff Act. However, it is reported that if the American people unanimously authorize him to do so, the US administrative authorities are prepared to take retaliatory actions. Section 338 of the US Tariff Act stipulates that the President may impose prohibitive tariff rates on imports from countries that discriminate against US trade, and may prohibit the import into the United States of any national goods loaded on ships of infringing countries. If the other party continues to discriminate against US trade, the President may prohibit nationals from conducting any trade with the infringing country. It is reported that a few years ago, the United States only used this intimidation against a certain European country, which was enough to end its discrimination against US trade. The United States has explained this decree and its provisions to the ambassador of the country concerned. At the moment, the US authorities do not feel that they need to implement this shocking step immediately, but according to reliable sources, if American public opinion becomes increasingly agitated about countries that repeatedly provoke, the US authorities will no longer hesitate and will resolutely implement it, especially in the Chinese territory occupied by the Japanese army, where the commercial, educational, and charitable undertakings of US expatriates have been systematically destroyed by the Japanese, and it is essential to respond decisively.

[Haitong News Agency, Washington, 3rd] Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in view of Japan's refusal to the US request to maintain the "open door" policy in China, specifically urged the government to strictly prohibit Japanese goods from being transported into the United States. Pittman vehemently advocated taking this step, even if it meant severing diplomatic relations between the United States and Japan, because Japan would have no interest to gain if it declared war on the United States. Although Pittman only expressed his personal opinion on this matter, he is the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and current US law authorizes the President to order this step to be taken.

### British Government Expresses Position - Attitude Towards Japan Consistent with US - Will Also Issue Strong Note

[Central News Agency, London, 3rd] The Central Government is now considering, following the precedent of the US government, to issue a note of the same nature to Japan. It is also reported that when British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, spoke with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, he also raised the various issues mentioned in the US note, and stated that the position of the British government is largely the same as that of the United States.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 3rd] Well-informed circles are extremely pleased with the US protest to Japan. Before the letter of protest was sent to the Japanese government, the United States informed the British government of the contents of the letter of protest. This is sufficient to enable the US government to understand that the UK does not need to take the same steps at present. The public believes that the British government avoided taking other actions when Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and British Ambassador Craigie held talks. The Japanese government is very clear about the British government's attitude on the "open door" issue and the "New Order in East Asia" plan for Japan in the Far East. The British government and political circles hold a very firm opinion on this point, which is completely consistent with the United States.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] The newspapers do not pay much attention to Wang Jingwei's actions, but pay close attention to the American note to Japan. The Washington correspondent of The Times reported that the US government's note to the Japanese government is a summary of the requests made in previous notes, so it is a final overall solution to the Far East issue. The Washington correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" said that American political figures are gradually feeling that the situation in the Far East is becoming more serious, and the US government must take more active actions and should not be satisfied with not recognizing the results of Japanese aggression.

### French-Soviet Trade Agreement - Decided to Extend for One Year - Content Not Revised

[Central News Agency, Insk, 2nd] A semi-official source recently announced that the commercial treaty between France and the Soviet Union, which was established on January 6, 1936 and expired on February 30 last year, has been decided to extend for one year after negotiations between representatives of both sides in Paris, and the content has not been revised.

### Soviet Internal Affairs Committee Officials - Five Executed - Fabricated Facts to Frame the Innocent

[Reuters, Moscow, 2nd] Recently, the Soviet Union again launched a party prison. Five former officials of the People's Internal Affairs Committee in Kiev were sentenced to death today after a three-day trial by a military court for fabricating facts, evaluating and framing innocent people, and illegally arresting people.

### Spanish Rebel Police - Arrest British Consul - Due to 'Prohibited Parcels'

[Reuters, Burgos, 2nd] Reuters learned from authoritative sources that the British Acting Consul in San Sebastian, Mr. and Mrs. Golding, were arrested by rebel police tonight because the rebels found a British Consul's "prohibited parcel".

### Amazing Discovery - London Radio Image Transmission - Has Been Seen and Heard in New York

[Reuters, London, 2nd] New York's Heiyuan Radio Station issued an amazing message saying that the radio image transmission order broadcast from London's Alexandra Palace has been seen and heard in New York. The radius of radio image transmission is between 25 and 30 miles, but now it is known that it is possible to receive television at a distance of more than 3,000 miles under special circumstances. This matter has now shocked the entire radio industry.

### After a Year and a Half of Resistance

— Wang Jiyuan

New Situation on the Pacific

(Continued from page 2 of this newspaper on January 1) Three

Because of the foundation of China's long-term resistance, because of the increase in China's resistance strength, and also because of the weakening of Japan's power, the policies of the democratic theorists (Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union) who have interests in the Western Pacific have undergone a considerable and significant change.

The first sign of the change is that the leaders of the great powers have realized that "in the current international relations, the future depends not only on luck, nor only on conservatism, nor on fate, but on taking active action." (US President Roosevelt's speech on December 5.) British Prime Minister Chamberlain also felt that the basis for maintaining the status quo of peace should be supported by a strong military force. Therefore, 1938 was a year in which the democratic countries of Britain, France, and the United States tried to catch up with military expansion.

Let us only talk about the Pacific. This year, the United States' active military expansion in the Pacific broke the record since the European War. On the surface, the US Navy seems to be silent and defensive. As US Navy Admiral Hepburn tried to declare: "There will be no war in the Pacific for the United States." However, US Fleet Commander-in-Chief Reese specifically issued an order this year to cancel exercises in the Pacific. In fact, this silence is its active manifestation. When the British Navy began to withdraw most of its fleet stationed in China to Singapore, and withdrew its submarines in Hong Kong to the newly completed naval base in the Middle East, it was precisely when the United States began to expand its Pacific Fleet, seaports, and air force. Roosevelt plans to build the world's most powerful navy within six years and the world's most powerful air force within 1942. In order to facilitate future operations in the Pacific, the United States is also building Hawaii into the Gibraltar of the Pacific, and establishing a strong air force base with an investment of 11 million US dollars. The United States has also begun to plan the layout of the air force network from the US Ministry of Order through Mexico to Alaska, and its tip is the Hawaiian Islands, which are 2,400 miles away from the US coast. The US Navy Department has also approved the construction of air stations on Wake Island and Guam in the middle of the Pacific, which can be used for civilian purposes in peacetime and for military purposes in wartime. In the next year, the United States plans to build as many as 21 to 32 warships. These facts are enough to prove that the United States is currently taking advantage of the Sino-Japanese War and Japan's inability to compete with each long and short opportunities to increase its strength in the Pacific to maintain all treaties and the Far East Open Door Policy.

After Prime Minister Konoe openly declared the closure of the Far East door on November 3 and amended the Nine-Power Treaty, the United States resolutely defended the existing international treaties and adhered to the principle of the Open Door Policy. Recently, Roosevelt has further rumors of prohibiting the export of major military supplies and military raw materials to Japan, and the Sino-US loans that have been conducted for more than a year have been realized after a year and a half of resistance. This has to be said to be an active phenomenon that has not existed since the Stimson era. The activity of the United States towards the Far East is based on the strengthening of its own strength on the one hand, and on the weakening of Japan's national strength and the increase of China's resistance strength on the other hand.

Four

The second sign is the strengthening of the jointness of the Far East policies of Britain and France.

We know that since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the biggest loser in the Far East market has been Britain. However, under the pragmatism and diplomacy of Chamberlain and Simon, Britain's diplomacy towards the Far East has fully demonstrated its painful and hesitating state over the years. In particular, some short-sighted financiers and industrialists in the Far East are fully expressing their hesitant mentality. Britain hopes to establish a certain agreement with Japan, hoping that Japan can respect its superior position in the Far East, at least in South China, Japan should respect its inviolability.

### Governor of the Bank of England Norman Leaves for Germany Today - To Continue Discussing the Jewish Refugee Issue - And It Is Reported That He Will Meet with Hitler

[Haitong News Agency, London, 3rd] Economic and financial circles here believe that Sir Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, will travel to Berlin tomorrow to visit Dr. Schacht, Governor of the German National Bank, is not purely private in nature. It is generally expected that the financial issues related to Jewish refugees leaving Germany will be further negotiated in Berlin, and some people believe that Sir Norman will meet with Hitler in Bedesgarten, which is also possible.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] The German government has invited Lubry, the US representative of the International Refugee Committee, to Berlin to discuss the issue of the evacuation of German Jewish refugees. It is reported that Lubry has accepted this invitation, but the date of the trip has not been set. When he goes to Berlin, he will be accompanied by another US committee member, Paul, and financial advisor, Cotton.

### British Cabinet Tide Eases - No General Election Next Year

[Central News Agency, London, 3rd] The British Cabinet Tide has now eased. Among the five members of the opposition, two told Prime Minister Chamberlain that the invention that occurred a few days ago could not represent their opinions, and they did not sympathize with the attacks on national defense from all sides. The other two have apologized to the Prime Minister, so these four Cabinet members will not resign. It is reported that Chamberlain is quite satisfied with the national defense plan.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 3rd] British Interior Minister Hall has begun to prepare for the next general election, but the date has not been decided. Hall asked local officials to prepare the registers of voters in their jurisdictions. According to the opinions of some political figures, the UK is unlikely to hold a general election before 1940.

### Britain Will Build - Medium-Sized Destroyers - In Response to Germany's Increase in Submarines - Naval Officers Unanimously Agree

[Associated Press, London, 3rd] Beaver, a naval expert for the Daily Telegraph, wrote today that as a result of Germany's request to increase submarines, all British naval officers with war experience are urging Britain to build several medium-sized destroyers, so Britain will build 24 to 30 of these warships this year. He also pointed out that all British destroyers that are now completed and under construction are actually small cruisers of 1,690 to 1,920 tons. He also declared that the naval community welcomed the plan to have 50 medium-sized destroyers of 800 to 1,000 tons. This new warship has a reasonable high speed and is equipped with 4-inch and 4.7-inch caliber guns, and is equipped with several torpedo boats and bombs that can explode 30 to 40 feet deep in the water. He also said that Britain today has a total of 78 destroyers, some of which are old, and the total number of submarines owned by Germany, Italy, and Japan is as high as 264.

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 3rd] The German press this morning no longer maintained its silence on the British naval talks. Goering's organ "National News" said, "Germany has no intention of competing with Britain's naval efforts. The procedure for Germany to build submarines does not pose any danger. It only states the wording of the treaty as usual, so Britain has no reason to believe that Britain is threatened by Germany's construction of submarines."

### British Ambassador to Italy - Pounce Will Leave Office Next Year

[Reuters, London, 2nd] British Ambassador to Italy, Sir Pounce, will retire at the end of his term next April. The vacancy will be filled by Sir Roland, the former Ambassador to Turkey.

### The Last Time the Japanese Political Tide Was Set Off - The Konoe Cabinet Decided to Resign - The Successor Prime Minister Will Be Hiranuma - Political and Civilian Parties Resolutely Oppose Merger

[Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd] According to well-informed sources, Japanese government officials have met several times at the end of last year. As a result, Prime Minister Konoe has decided today to lead his cabinet members to resign this week. The successor is likely to be Baron Hiranuma, President of the Privy Council. It is reported that the main reason for this political tide is due to Internal Minister Suetsugu. Suetsugu is famous for his leaning towards fascism. Today, he firmly insists on the national mobilization of politics. In other words, if he only adopts the existing political parties, the parties must be merged into one, while the Minseito and Seiyukai, which advocate national mobilization and spiritual mobilization, resolutely oppose it. It is also reported that Suetsugu threatened to dissolve the parliament. Once the parliament is dissolved, the so-called "general accounting budget" and the 6 billion yuan "unexpected" budget will not be able to be passed. As a result, Japan's wartime finances will fall into chaos. Therefore, Konoe should hang up his crown before the parliament convenes on the 20th of this month.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd] It is reported that the special budget for the next fiscal year has increased the war expenses for "boxing incidents against China" by approximately 59.4 million pounds, which is much higher than the previous year. The new budget totals approximately 35.3 million pounds. The budget for the previous fiscal year was 29.4 million pounds.

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Various Japanese political figures have made various talks in the past few days, and they will probably continue to proceed this week. According to well-informed sources, the content is related to the impending cabinet reorganization, but so far no specific information has been leaked. It is generally expected that this matter must be decided before January 10. The main figures participating in the talks, in addition to the Minister of Defense, are Minister of Finance Tada, Minister of Education Araki, and Minister of Health Kido, but Internal Minister Suetsugu is not involved. A few days ago, Privy Council President Baron Hiranuma and Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa also spoke with Prime Minister Konoe and other cabinet members on behalf of the royal family. Political figures particularly pointed out that the most important purpose of this cabinet reorganization is to ensure the unity of national government orders.

### French Prime Minister Inspects North Africa; Corsicans Express Loyalty; Gibraltar to Implement Boycott of Italian Goods

[Reuters, Bastia, 2nd] The Mayor of Bastia, while welcoming French Prime Minister Daladier, stated that during the European War, Corsicans sacrificed 40,000 lives. If even an inch of French territory is threatened, Corsica is willing to fight to the last person to assist France. Daladier, currently inspecting French territories in the Mediterranean, expressed his gratitude for the warm welcome, declaring, "I know that you will proceed on the path of courage and honor." Amidst the crowd singing the Marseillaise, he boarded the cruiser "Foch" to head to Bizerte, expected to arrive tomorrow morning.

[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] According to reports indirectly received from Gibraltar, Gibraltar is brewing an economic boycott movement. Italian exporters have been ordered to rapidly transport Italian goods into Abyssinia. The Italian Consul-General in Gibraltar has also gone to Rome. However, the people there are very calm. According to French reports, Abyssinia is showing signs of unrest. The economic situation there is deteriorating due to a lack of money, and except for major cities, other areas have not been conquered.

(Newspaper Attacks French Premier's Tour)

[Haitong Agency, Rome, 3rd] Italian newspapers report that French Prime Minister Daladier's inspection of Tunisia is an anti-Italian demonstration. Last night, all newspapers here strongly criticized this. "Lavoro" stated, "Daladier's move not only does not alleviate the dispute between France and Italy, but exacerbates it." "Il Messaggero" published an article titled "The Italian Land of Corsica," stating, in brief, that French demonstrations cannot change historical facts. The culture, language, and customs of Corsica originally came from Italian Tuscany. French "Latin spirit" and "Latin brotherhood" rhetoric no longer have any effect in Italy, as Italians no longer trust such hypocritical words.

[Reuters, Rome, 2nd] The press here does not attach importance to French Prime Minister Daladier's tour of the Mediterranean territories. It is said that the planned "show of force" (referring to naval exercises) has now been cancelled.

[Central News Agency, Weimar, 2nd] The Italian "Popolo d'Italia" stated that acknowledging the dominance of the German-Italian axis in Central and Eastern Europe, while also acknowledging their dominance in the Mediterranean, is one of the conditions for maintaining European peace. To this day, the future of Europe is often judged by the actions of the German-Italian axis and the resistance of other countries. This is even more certain than in the past. Future developments will follow one of two paths: (1) Resistance will eventually turn into understanding. If so, we can use peaceful means to shift the current stalemate in Central Europe and the Mediterranean, with Germany and Italy holding the advantage. (2) If this resistance is unreasonable, then the future of Europe will definitely encounter extremely serious difficulties.

(German Newspaper Expresses Support for Italy)

[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] People here are paying close attention to the French Prime Minister's tour of Mediterranean territories. However, officials remain silent, apparently unwilling to express much opinion on the matter at this time. The "Hamburger Fremdenblatt" stated, "Franco-Italian relations have become a European problem. If foreigners can understand the clear and unbreakable obligations that bind us to Italy, which have been firmly established by Führer Hitler, then our attitude towards the Mediterranean issue will not be misunderstood."

Brief Commentary

### Three Points to Note Amidst the Condemnation of Wang Jingwei

Wang Jingwei's collusion with the enemy has caused a nationwide uproar. The Central Executive Committee has unanimously decided to permanently expel Wang from the party and remove all his positions. From now on, Wang Jingwei cannot rely on his position in the Kuomintang to carry out his conspiracies of stirring up trouble. We have already strongly pointed this out in yesterday's brief commentary. However, Wang's betrayal is a pre-planned action and the exposure of the most vicious strategy in the enemy's plan to subjugate China. They will certainly not wash their hands of this and are preparing for a final struggle. All kinds of rumors, incitements, and divisive conspiracies will emerge one after another. Therefore, amidst the nationwide condemnation of Wang, we in the public opinion should especially point out:

First, up to now, the Central Government's handling of Wang still follows the principle of leniency. This is not for personal reasons, but to give Wang a final opportunity to repent and apologize to the people. Therefore, we must not presumptuously assume that the work of punishing the traitor is already complete. On the contrary, the whole country must be more vigilant and be ready to pay attention to and combat all activities of division, compromise, and surrender.

Second, although Wang's betrayal involves a major conspiracy, he is now facing condemnation and attacks in the country and criticisms and accusations in the international community, and even the enemy side has expressed disappointment. His close associates are also showing signs of division. Therefore, we must recognize that Wang's actions are merely the actions of himself and a small number of national scum, and definitely cannot be seen as representing the actions of a certain faction. Only in this way can a small number of wavering elements suddenly realize the truth, taking Wang as a warning and respecting themselves. Even among those who are serving Wang, there are many who cherish themselves, love the party, and love the country. From now on, they should especially recognize right and wrong and support unity and resistance to the end.

Third, the enemy is clearly using Wang's betrayal as propaganda material. Today, the enemy's news agency has already released rumors of a "Chongqing coup." We must not be deceived! We must know that national scum cannot withstand the tide of the times and will eventually be eliminated. This is a natural law and there is nothing to be surprised about. Therefore, Wang's betrayal is not only not a loss for the Kuomintang, but it has made its organization healthier and its prestige higher because of the Kuomintang Central Committee's stern handling. At the same time, it is not only not a loss for the anti-Japanese national united front, but will make the unity of the anti-Japanese parties even stronger. The enemy's tricks of sowing discord only prove that their efforts are in vain!

Editorial

### The Abolition of the Franco-Italian Agreement and Future Trends

The diplomatic relations between France and Italy have lost their normal state since 1936, when France did not recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. This time, with the establishment of the Munich Four-Power Agreement, Daladier, in order to thoroughly clarify the European situation and consolidate France's international position, did not hesitate to compromise and yield to Fascist countries in many ways. Taking this opportunity, he re-sent an ambassador to Italy in October, hoping to obtain Mussolini's understanding. Since Italy's conquest of Abyssinia, the presentation of credentials by the new ambassador should have referred to the Italian king as "Emperor of Abyssinia." This contradicted France's position, and the dispatch of a new ambassador was delayed for several years for this reason. This move is generally seen as a prelude to France's formal recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. However, France's compromise and friendly gesture towards Italy not only failed to satisfy Mussolini, but increased his infinite desires. When France and Germany were preparing to jointly issue a declaration of understanding, the Italian Fascist rulers suddenly issued a call for territorial demands on France, which was truly unexpected by Daladier and Bonnet.

Since then, Franco-Italian relations have been strained. Italy has constantly been preparing for war to threaten France into making concessions. At the same time, it notified the French Ambassador to Italy, Ponsot, a week ago, stating that the Italian government felt that the Franco-Italian agreement signed on January 7, 1935, was no longer in line with the needs of the times and believed that it could no longer be effective. The main objectives of the Franco-Italian agreement were: first, to guarantee the territorial integrity and independence of Austria and other small countries in Central Europe to prevent German aggression. Therefore, the agreement specifically stated: "The governments of France and Italy, for the necessity of maintaining the independence and integrity of Austria, agree to decide that when Austria's independence and integrity are threatened by other countries, the two governments may consult with Austria on countermeasures..." The second was to resolve the African colonial issue. At that time, Italy made several demands on France: the most important were (1) that Italians, who constituted the majority of the population in Tunisia, should be granted autonomy, and (2) that the border between French Africa and Italian Libya should be redrawn to approach Lake Chad, and Italy should also enjoy management rights over the French Red Sea port of Djibouti. As a result of the negotiations, France finally agreed to cede 40,000 square miles south of Libya and the opposite shore of the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait to Italian Eritrea, and also granted Italy the right to participate in the operation of the railway from Addis Ababa to the port of Djibouti. This is the process and main terms of the successful negotiations.

Now that Austria has been annexed by Germany and Czechoslovakia has fallen into the hands of Hitler, the guarantee of Central Europe has become a historical term. Mussolini's ambitions have lost their basis, and seeing that his ally Hitler's repeated threats of diplomacy have been successful and Germany's national strength has advanced by leaps and bounds, he had to decide to withdraw from Central Europe, which he had coveted for many years, and seek development elsewhere. His followers' calls for Tunisia, Corsica, and Nice, as well as the declaration of the abolition of the Rome Agreement, are for this reason.

Mussolini's declaration of the abolition of the Franco-Italian agreement was intended to imitate Hitler's old tricks in order to achieve his territorial demands without war. However, whether this dream can be realized is questionable. Although the diplomatic policies of Chamberlain and Daladier advocate compromise and even surrender to totalitarian countries, France is not Czechoslovakia. Even if Daladier does not hesitate to make concessions to Italy, given the fervent patriotism of the French people, there is no reason to cede territory to other countries without a fight and willingly be a defeated country. This may be one of the reasons why Italy cannot achieve its goals. Furthermore, once Tunisia and Corsica are occupied by Italy, she can absolutely control the Mediterranean. At that time, not only will France be constantly threatened, but Britain's route to India will also be controlled by Italy. Although Chamberlain focuses on reality, he probably cannot allow him to do as he did during the Munich Agreement. This visit to Italy should be wary of past failures and should not dare to encourage France to make concessions again. This may be the second reason why Mussolini's plan cannot succeed.

Since intimidation tactics cannot work, the next step is to use force. This has always been the consistent policy of fascist aggressor groups. The Eastern Japanese imperialism is like this, Germany is like this, and Italy is no exception. Therefore, Franco-Italian relations have recently turned from easing to tension again. According to reports from various news agencies, Italian troops stationed in East Africa have mobilized a large number of troops to advance towards French Somaliland, and have allegedly occupied six border defense areas. In addition, they have put forward four conditions to France: (1) That Italian expatriates in Tunisia be granted large-scale independence immediately. (2) Allow Italians to purchase uncultivated land in Tunisia. (3) France cede Djibouti and sell the railway there to Italy. (4) That the Suez Canal be jointly managed by the Italian side, while also encouraging Italian expatriates to hold demonstrations.

Italy's finances were already stretched. Especially since the war against Abyssinia, it has become even more strained. Currently, it has felt helpless when developing Abyssinia's capital. Recently, there have been rumors that Foreign Minister Ciano will hire Britain. It has been said that his greatest purpose is to raise debts. It is impossible for such a poor country to engage in war again because of the lack of strength. However, it is also impossible for Italy to stop here. Under this situation, Germany is secretly supporting Italy on one hand and accelerating its aggression against Southeast Europe on the other. Italy is continuously holding a tense deadlock with France, which cannot be resolved for a while. In conclusion, if Britain and France cannot join hands with other democratic countries to form a war front and establish a collective security system, in our observation, the situation in Europe will still be impossible to clarify, or may fall into a more chaotic and tense situation.

### The Summary of the First Phase of the War of Resistance and the Prospects for the Second Phase [3]

— Pan Lang

(Continued from the second edition on January 1)

(2) The scattered nature of the combat forces in the occupied areas and their loss of connection with the overall strategy; (3) The cooperation between the military and the people is still insufficient, and the political work in the military has not been earnestly and fully launched; (4) The mobilization of the masses is unrealistic and not universal, and sticks and ropes replace persuasion and propaganda; (5) The protection of the families of soldiers, the treatment of the wounded, and the propaganda of conscription are still largely inadequate. Politically, (1) due to the conservatism and selfishness of a few people, friction between parties continues, and the anti-Japanese national united front is not consolidated and expanded enough; (2) due to the failure to eliminate some conservative and wavering tendencies within the government, traitors and collaborators are readily used, and therefore the crisis of compromise with Japan and reactionary division still exists; (3) due to the continued resistance of feudal remnants to political progress, traitors and collaborators are even more colluding with pro-Japanese elements to instigate opposition to the government, opposition to the War of Resistance, and preparation for "peace" and "independence"! (4) The oppression of patriotic organizations and patriotic youth, and even the arrest and killing of Communist Party members, continue to occur in various places. Socially and economically, (1) the organization and training of large numbers of refugees has not been carried out in a unified and planned manner, while senior officials and civilians spend lavishly abroad, while the general middle and lower class refugees, although not all end up in ditches, are mostly displaced in other places. (2) Although efforts have been made to provide relief to a large number of out-of-school youth, there is still a lack of more active plans for overall relief, organization, and training. (3) The work of eliminating corrupt local bullies has not been carried out, and all new government policies and laws cannot be fully understood and loyally supported by the farmers and workers; (4) the lack of labor laws and land laws that are adapted to the war of resistance and the principle of reasonable burdens means that the lives of workers, farmers, and merchants have not been adequately improved. Finally, in terms of international relations, although our government's foreign policy has made very clear progress, the central policy is still not firm enough, the foreign propaganda agencies and personnel are still not sound enough, and national diplomacy is almost non-existent. As for the enemy's special agencies and spy networks all over the world, we are not even prepared for defense!

Due to the lack of all progress, and due to the failure to overcome all shortcomings, we have not been able to fundamentally change the comparative strengths and weaknesses of the enemy and ourselves until the end of the first phase of the War of Resistance, and we have not been able to stop the enemy's offensive.

The Current Situation and Characteristics of the War of Resistance

After the successive abandonment of Guangzhou and Wuhan, the entire situation of the War of Resistance has undergone new changes. However, Chairman Chiang's message to the nation on October 30 clearly pointed out that "the key to the military victory or defeat of the War of Resistance does not lie in the gain or loss of Wuhan, but in maintaining our continued and lasting strength," and that "the key to the success or failure of the war lies in the amount of active and passive components. The reason why I treat the enemy is to be unyielding in prolonged war, so that the enemy goes deeper and becomes more passive." He clearly pointed out that the abandonment of Wuhan was a "turning point for our country to actively advance and turn defense into offense" and a "pivot for thoroughly resisting the war and turning defeat into victory," which is to say that the future situation of the War of Resistance will basically move towards a "confrontation between the enemy and ourselves," and our task is to strive for all conditions to victoriously enter the second stage of the War of Resistance. According to Mao Zedong's theory in "On Protracted War": the first stage of the War of Resistance is mainly based on mobile warfare as the main strategy, and the second stage of the War of Resistance is mainly based on guerrilla warfare as the main strategy. The first stage is the period of enemy offensive and our defense. The enemy attempts to occupy the three important cities of Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Lanzhou, and connect these three strongholds. However, we cannot therefore believe that we must lose Lanzhou, and that the first stage of the War of Resistance is over only after the enemy has opened up the Yuehan, Pinghan, and Longhai Railways and the Xilan Highway. We should not only, but it is also possible to prevent the enemy from ever connecting Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Lanzhou, and it should also be possible to prevent the enemy from ever capturing Xi'an and Lanzhou, until they are driven out of Chinese territory. Therefore, we can answer the question of "the characteristics of the current situation of the War of Resistance":

The current War of Resistance is still in the transitional period from the first phase (or first stage) of the anti-Japanese protracted war to the second phase (or second stage). And after our efforts in various aspects after the abandonment of Guangzhou and Wuhan, this transitional period will also become a thing of the past, and the beginning of this new spring of 1939 will also be determined as the true beginning of the second phase (or second stage) of the War of Resistance.

After the successive abandonment of Guangzhou and Wuhan, due to the loss of our major industrial and commercial cities, the occupation of major railways, the territorial division of national power and combat positions, the cutting off of major sea routes, and the difficulties in finance, economy, and transportation, it has become more difficult to supply munitions. These are the difficulties we encountered at the time, and these difficulties still affect the war situation today and in the future. Moreover, the enemy has also begun to plan the establishment of a nationwide puppet regime on a large scale, and is intensifying its conspiracy to provoke internal disputes in our country. Traitors, pro-Japanese elements, and wavering elements are also intensifying their activities of division, surrender, compromise, and so on. These difficulties and the enemy's conspiracies still exist and are developing until the end of 1938. The enlarged Sixth Plenary Session of the CPC, which opened on October 14, had already pointed out in its resolution that "differences of opinion may arise in the anti-Japanese camp during this period, and even wavering and local rebellion of certain elements." These are all serious problems in the current and future War of Resistance. At the same time, the unity and progress of our country have also reached a degree of rapid development since the abandonment of Guangzhou and Wuhan. Our highest leader and the people of the whole country are more determined to oppose compromise and resist the war to the end! The cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and the united front have developed even further. The development of the number of members of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and their political influence have also expanded even further! Our large army that defended Wuhan has quickly and completely transferred, we have quickly deployed new fronts in the Xianggan, Xiangyue, and Gui borders, we have completed great defense works in western Hubei and the Shanxi-Henan area, and we are thus preventing and will prevent the enemy's continued offensive on all fronts. At the same time, we have begun to develop guerrilla warfare more extensively behind the enemy's lines, and anti-Japanese base areas are constantly developing. Our vast and complete rear area, the western provinces, are enthusiastically carrying out all the construction to persist in the War of Resistance and prepare for national construction! All our shortcomings in politics, economy, culture, and mobilization of the masses are rapidly progressing and gradually being overcome; and the temporarily reversed international situation is also due to our unity and determination to resist the war. Starting from the establishment of credit loans to China by the United Kingdom and the United States in December, the international sympathy and movement to aid our country and sanction Japanese aggressors is developing extensively! On the contrary, although the Japanese aggressors seem to have achieved victory on the surface, in reality they are increasingly feeling the inadequacy and dispersion of their forces due to the extension of the front line, and future mountain warfare far from the coast, railways, and major rivers will cause the enemy great difficulties. At the same time, the enemy's rear is increasingly caught in a state of being busy coping with everything due to the widespread development of guerrilla forces. In addition, we should also pay attention to the crisis in the enemy's domestic economy and finance, the high tide of popular anti-war sentiment, and the deterioration of Anglo-Japanese, Franco-Japanese, and US-Japanese relations caused by the enemy's invasion of South China. In front of our strong, long-term, united War of Resistance, the Japanese aggressors can only find the path to their own total collapse!

So, do we now have the possibility of launching a battle to turn defeat into victory? My answer is that there is this possibility. Summarizing the above narration and summarizing it into the following points are the favorable conditions and basis that we now have for entering the "confrontation between the enemy and ourselves" situation: (1) In the year and a half of the War of Resistance, we have not only achieved the goal of exchanging space for time, but also made the enemy pay a heavy price in these "spaces," especially in the hard-fought battles of the past three phases, which consumed the enemy's time for sixteen months, more than 300,000 troops, hundreds of warships, and tens of trillions of military expenses; we still maintain an army of more than two million, and have learned new strategies and tactics in combat and increased progress in political, economic, and social aspects. (2) Chairman Chiang Wei said: "Most of the manpower and material resources of central and southeastern China have been transferred to the western provinces, and the development of the west and the construction of transportation have reached a preliminary basis," and new national defense works have been completed and many new military industries have been created, and many new army corps have been formed. (3) Chairman Chiang Wei said: "In the major areas of Hubei, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangxi outside Wuhan, and as far as the enemy's rear in Hebei, Shandong, Liaoning, Jehol, Suiyuan, Chahar, and the trunk lines of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, we have formulated plans for protracted warfare, and deployed suitable bases and forces, and all deployments have been completed," and there is also (4) the expansion of international aid, and (5) the intensification of enemy difficulties!

### (III) The Situation and Future of the Second Phase of the War of Resistance

× Comparison of Our Situations

We must first point out that at the beginning of this second phase of the War of Resistance, the difficulties encountered by our × people were far greater than what we encountered, and were insurmountable. First, from a military perspective, the current distribution of × troops in the five provinces of North China is about eleven divisions, with a force of more than 300,000. However, whether crossing the Yellow River westward or returning to invade the Jin-Cha-Ji border region, no more than 40,000 troops can be deployed. In addition, the forces required in Central China, Jiangnan, and South China are now twice that of North China, and there are still huge gaps between the regions that are within the reach of our government's laws and regulations. Moreover, regardless of whether the × people attack westward, southwest, or northwest in the future, all terrain and transportation conditions will not allow them to exert their unique strengths, but will increase their difficulties; conversely, we only need to continue to maintain and strengthen the combat effectiveness of the front-line defense forces, fully adopt new strategies, and use large-scale field corps to stop the × army's offensive; at the same time, behind the × army in the war zone, send large-scale advancing corps to coordinate with the original guerrilla forces to develop extensive guerrilla warfare and seize the × army from the rear; meanwhile, intensify the establishment of new modernized troops in the rear and actively create new offensive forces. Final victory can be guaranteed. Second, from a political perspective, the × people have now penetrated deep into the interior, but cannot achieve their delusion of ruling China. Currently, more than two-thirds of the cities in the five provinces of North China are still in the hands of our army and people. Many collaborationist maintenance societies have been repeatedly destroyed, and the defection of puppet troops and the assistance of workers, peasants, small merchants, etc., to guerrilla forces have gradually spread to Central China, Jiangnan, and even South China. As long as we pay more attention to the fighting in the occupied areas, expand guerrilla warfare, win over puppet troops, win over the masses, establish, maintain, and expand the anti-Japanese regime in the occupied areas, and coordinate with our military development, final victory can be even more guaranteed. Third, from an economic perspective, the × people forcibly occupied the two cities of Yuehan, originally wanting to fully restore business in the Yangtze River coastal area to alleviate the domestic financial and economic panic, that is, to absorb money and raw materials from China to support the war of aggression. However, taking Manchukuo as an example, it can be seen that it cannot meet their current urgent needs; moreover, we already have the existence of the anti-Japanese regime in the Jin-Cha-Ji border region in North China, and guerrilla warfare is very developed, making it impossible for the × people's plan to be realized. All factories, mines, and railways in major cities in Central China and Jiangnan have either been bombed or moved to the western provinces. Even if there is any surplus, it cannot be relied upon for × military production. The situation of commercial trade is the same. As long as we more widely develop guerrilla warfare, especially making the guerrilla warfare in South China and Jiangnan coordinate with regular army operations, then the × people's plan can completely fail. If we can resolutely implement wartime financial and economic policies, extensively develop western production and construction, increase agriculture, and develop inland transportation, then our resources will be inexhaustible in the long term, while the × people will inevitably collapse midway. Fourth, from the domestic situation, the × side has a small country and population, and is not rich in resources. As the war develops further, the military strength will feel more insufficient and scattered, the economic difficulties will become increasingly serious, military production will have no follow-up, and anti-war sentiments in the Taiwanese, Korean, Manchurian, and Mongolian armies will become increasingly agitated, proving that the × people cannot support a long-term war of resistance. We are the opposite. Taking the southwestern and northwestern provinces as an example, there are vast areas and populations, and all construction is progressing rapidly. Even in the occupied areas, we have an irresistible force that will become a major victory factor in the future counter-offensive. Finally, from the international situation, in order to develop its power in China, the × people must eliminate European and American forces, but therefore they must also create more enemies abroad; conversely, after the fall of the two cities of Yuehan, we can persist in unity and resistance to the end, and the movement of British and American powers to aid China and restrain Japan has a new development!

× Our Preparations Today

Due to the severity of various difficulties both internally and abroad, the × people have determined that their policy will always be a quick battle and a quick decision. This year's New Year, the Japanese cabinet will be reorganized again, but this policy will never change—based on this policy. On the one hand, he has no choice but to drain the pond to catch all the fish, implement the National Mobilization Law, and prepare for a longer-term war, but this is a last resort. Their main goal today is to obtain a temporary "peace"—therefore, their future strategy is still planning to attack southwest and northwest: the first step is to capture Xi'an and Lanzhou, and then connect the points of Guangzhou, Hankou, and Lanzhou, on the one hand consolidating the vast occupied areas, strengthening governance, and preparing for a larger war, and on the other hand forcing us to be partial to the western valleys, unable to develop, and then "gathering and annihilating" our main force. However, the × people themselves dare not say that they have any certainty about this dream. In the two months since they captured Wuhan, they have been actively reorganizing their forces, redeploying, and preparing for a larger strategic offensive; but at the same time, they have focused on political offensives. On the one hand, they are implementing a false "pacification" policy in the occupied areas, buying people's hearts, hoping to put the war burden that the Japanese people can no longer afford on our compatriots in the occupied areas; on the other hand, they are particularly emphasizing the slogans of "anti-communism" and "attacking the northwest," and emphasizing the lure of "peace talks" in order to instigate pro-Japanese traitors to induce vacillating elements to carry out activities to divide China's unity. This movement had already been widely launched by the end of 1938. What about us? Since the fall of the two cities of Yuehan, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek first issued a letter to the people and telegraphed the Second National Political Council, proclaiming China's determination to unite and resist to the end. Following this, the enlarged Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China issued a letter to the national soldiers and people of all parties, sincerely proposing further cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and anti-Japanese parties, and determining the policy of long-term cooperation to build a republic based on the Three Principles of the People. Military leaders such as Chen Cheng, Bai Chongxi, and Zhu De have successively delivered important speeches insisting on united resistance, implementing a protracted war, a comprehensive war, an active war, and intensifying the political work of the army, not only pointing out the future of victory in the war of resistance, but also pointing out that we have concrete methods. At the same time, in these two months, we have begun to make rapid progress in military, political, economic, diplomatic, and cultural aspects, such as the reorganization of war zones, the unification of command, the adjustment and strengthening of combat effectiveness in the occupied areas, the promulgation of regulations on military-civilian cooperation, the improvement of political institutions in several provinces and cities, the strict punishment of corrupt and oppressive officials such as Deng Ti, the strengthening of mass mobilization, the new achievements of the Second National Political Council, the establishment of provincial and municipal councils within a time limit, the success of British and American credit loans, the implementation of the Western Development Plan, the beginning of the Northwest National Defense Industry, and the successive completion of major national defense projects and new troops, which are relatively prominent. In addition, such as clearing out the few ethnic minority scum and double-dealers in the government, intensifying the campaign to sweep away Han traitors and × spies, and strengthening the close unity of anti-Japanese parties, are necessary countermeasures to combat the current strategy and political strategy of the Japanese aggressors.

The Future of the Second Phase of the War of Resistance

In his address at the memorial week for the late President Sun Yat-sen on December 26, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specially pointed out to us: "Our war of resistance has entered a new stage. I have repeatedly pointed out recently that the past eighteen months can be called the first phase of the war of resistance, that is, the early stage of the war of resistance. From now on, it will be the second phase of the war of resistance, that is, the later stage of the war of resistance. We now have a really good atmosphere, unprecedented since the beginning of the war, in terms of the morale and fighting spirit of the soldiers on the front lines, whether in the north or south. The general officers and soldiers all know that this Sino-Japanese war is about the × people completely destroying China; for us, it is about fundamentally saving China; therefore, their will is unusually strong and their spirit is extremely positive. The general public is also able to recognize that the × people will not stop until they have carried out their poisonous conspiracy of aggression and will not give up until they have destroyed China. We have no chance of survival unless we seek life from death. Therefore, the environment is full of suffering, but the will of the military and civilians in various places is becoming more and more firm. As long as the front and rear recognize the national crisis, everyone is of one mind, working hard and sacrificing their lives towards the goal of final victory without slackening or surrendering, I am convinced that the goal of the war of resistance can be achieved." The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China in October also clearly stated: "The enlarged Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China firmly believes that the great Chinese nation, with five thousand years of culture and a population of 450 million, under the conditions of national unity and long-term cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, under the conditions of the anti-war and anti-fascist movement of the Japanese people, under the conditions of the sympathy and assistance of all advanced mankind in peace-loving nations and countries around the world, will carry out a victorious national self-defense war against Japanese ×, drive Japanese × out of China, and establish an independent, free, happy, and bright new China based on the Three Principles of the People. The bright future has seen the dawn, and the final victory is certain to belong to the Chinese nation!"

It is 1939! Let everyone review their weapons! Get serious! Get tense! Only by enthusiastically and resolutely participating in this struggle can we have our freedom and our victory! The bright future has seen the dawn! Forward! We must have freedom! We must have victory!

### Transportation Facilities Since the War of Resistance Started (Part 2)

— Minister of Transportation Zhang Jia'ao

This overdue highway and waterway transportation conference believes that the southwestern and western provinces are now the base for the War of Resistance and national construction. The development of the inland economy, the communication of international trade, and the transportation of supplies to the front all depend on water and land transportation, and waterway transportation is more economical than land transportation. All important waterways should be used as much as possible, and methods should be devised to connect them with highways or railways to increase transportation efficiency. Special provisions are made for trunk lines of water and land transportation and improved main waterways in the rear, and it is planned to increase ships. The first phase of the dredging project for waterways was resolved to be supervised and handled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, to be completed by the end of May of the 28th year. To increase ships, the Ministry will be required to rush to build 1,500 wooden boats of 30 tons or less within a time limit for distribution and application.

Since the successive fall of Hankou and Guangzhou, traffic in Chongqing has become increasingly busy. The Joint Office of Water and Land Transportation of the Ministry has specially handled the Chongqing-Kunming joint transportation, transporting by water from Chongqing to Yibin, and then transporting by pack animals to Kunming via the Xu-Kun Avenue, which is beneficial to the transportation efficiency in the rear. In addition, because there are many dangerous beaches in the Sichuan River, ships use manpower to pull them upstream, which is not only time-consuming and laborious, but also prone to accidents. Recently, the transportation of the Sichuan River has become increasingly important. A Beach Management Committee has been organized to recruit knowledgeable and experienced personnel to improve the beach pulling method, and it is planned to first set up beach stations in dangerous places such as Qingtan and Xienan to use machine pulling to make Jiangfang transportation safer and faster.

In terms of aviation, the Ministry also increased the original routes and flights with the development of the war situation, and tried its best to maintain traffic in the face of the × people's destruction of civil aviation, and purchased additional aircraft to meet the needs. Before the War of Resistance, the total mileage of the original routes was 15,005 kilometers. After the outbreak of the war, the routes in various places changed with the war situation. Before Hankou was lost, the Hankou-Hong Kong line was originally changed to night flights to ensure safety. Recently, China National Aviation Corporation opened new routes with a total length of 3,300 miles, and Eurasia Aviation Corporation opened new routes with a total length of more than 6,300 kilometers. There are also about 4,400 kilometers of routes under planning.

(IV) Telecommunications

Wartime telecommunications are very important to the war. The Ministry has specially organized a Wartime Telecommunications Committee to coordinate everything in response to the situation. At the same time, it maintains close contact with the long-distance telephone lines set up by various provinces to facilitate long-distance communication. It is estimated that the Ministry has added 4,480.5 kilometers of various lines during the War of Resistance, and there are still 3,583 kilometers under construction. Therefore, the copper wire used in telecommunications during this year of the War of Resistance can be equal to filling up. It is estimated that eight radio stations have been installed, and 14 are still being planned but not completed. Three telephone sets have been installed and completed, and one is being installed. As for the international radio station, it has already been completed and can directly communicate with major cities in Europe and the United States, which is very convenient.

The emergency repair of telecommunications is similar in nature to railways, and is very important to military communications. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, the power lines along the Ping-Han Railway were bombed by × aircraft. For the sake of quick repair and convenient military communications, two repair line engineering teams were organized in Dingzhou, Shijiazhuang, etc., equipped with trucks and bicycles, to repair them nearby at any time. When the 813 Shanghai Battle began, repair line engineering teams were added to the eastern battlefields such as Nanxiang, Zhenru, Kunshan, and Suzhou. Later, as the front line expanded, the number of engineering teams also increased. As of now, there are a total of about 50 teams distributed in various places.

(V) Postal Service

In terms of postal service, in order to meet the communication needs of the combat troops, military post offices were set up immediately after the start of the War of Resistance. The scope of the military post office was limited to the postal areas of Jin, Hebei, Shandong, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. Then it gradually extended to the areas of Shaanxi, Henan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and other areas. At the end of August of the 27th year, the military postal conference enriched the organization, sorted out the regulations, and became more strict. Now, there are battles in southern Hubei, northern Hunan, and the coastal area of eastern Guangdong, and the scope of the military post office has been expanded accordingly. At present, there are eight general inspection sections, including Shaanxi, Jin, Henan, western Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, eastern Guangdong, and northern Jiangsu. Each general section is set up with several sub-sections for management.

### The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board Promotes Production Education in the Northwest

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] Hang Liwu, Director-General of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board, went to Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia to inspect the educational undertakings run by the Board. He has now returned to Chongqing. It is reported that the Board has an educational class in Lanzhou, and is now actively cooperating with the Department of Education to host training courses and prepare books and instruments for distribution to various schools. It also established a middle school in Xining, Qinghai, with hundreds of students in senior high school, junior high school, and elementary school. It also plans to establish Suzhou Middle School in Suzhou. In addition, the Board believes that production and health education should be promoted in the Northwest, and the Science Department is specially handling the promotion of cooperation, and jointly established several health work stations with the Northwest Epidemic Prevention Office in Gansu, Qinghai, and other provinces.

### We Attack Shilong and Dongguan; Guangdong Soldiers Optimistic About the War; 3,000 Puppet Troops in Jiaodong Defect

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 3rd Special] The members of the puppet organizations here are greatly frustrated because Wang Jingwei's advocacy of peace talks has obviously failed. They originally fantasized about using Wang's influence to consolidate themselves, but now they know that there is little hope. The military and political leaders of Guangdong Province, starting with the new chairman General Li Hanhun, will issue a telegram within a few days to refute Wang's views. At the same time, they will also declare in the telegram their determination to counterattack Guangzhou and eliminate the Han traitors in South China. Our army recently attacked Shilong and Dongguan's ×. The × in Xijiang still intend to go up the river to exert pressure on Guizhou Province in an attempt to contain our army's actions in other areas. Our troops in Zhaoqing and Deqing have seen through their tricks and have been strictly on guard. The military leaders of Guangdong Province are very optimistic about the future of the war, and the morale of our army is also increasingly high.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 3rd Special] More than 3,000 puppet troops of Zhao Baoyuan's unit in Jiaodong have defected. Shen Honglie replied to approve and awarded 5,000 yuan. Zhao has telegraphed Wan Fulin and the whole country, expressing his determination to save the country and kill ×.

[Central News Agency, Zhongxiang, 2nd] The number of × near Yingshan City has increased to 7,000 or 8,000, some of whom are moving around and disturbing our people.

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 1st] At 12 noon, we attacked × from the northeast of Taipingchang and fought fiercely for two hours, killing more than 30 ×, including a × second lieutenant, and capturing more than 10 rifles, a × flag, and many important documents.

### Young Military Committee Members Demand Arrest of Wang, The Traitor; Central Government Considering; Report of Arrest of Wang's Followers Not Accurate

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 3rd Special] The Central Government does not intend to make any further statements about Wang, pitying him for being foolish for a while, hoping that he will wake up and return to the country. Some young committee members and soldiers advocate a public order for arrest, which the Central Government is still considering. Feng Yuxiang said that Wang had a nervous breakdown. Knowing this long ago, he regretted that Sun Fengming's assassination failed in the past. A statue of Sun should be erected in commemoration. All official newspapers in Chongqing are trying their best to publish news about punishing Wang. Public opinion unanimously criticizes Wang for being rebellious.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] Government authorities here deny that any of Wang's party members have been arrested. According to a person in charge of the Kuomintang, Wang only has a few close colleagues who are private, but no party members.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 2nd] The swiftness with which the Kuomintang's temporary committee of members took action on Wang's matter surprised foreign observers. Although there have been precedents for such actions in the past, it has never been heard of to permanently expel a senior party member from the party and remove all positions. It is reported that there were no objections from the members during the discussion of this matter, and they all unanimously approved the action and agreed with the statement directly accusing Wang of collaborating with × and betraying the country.

Where Did Wang Zhaoming Go?

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 3rd Special] Although Wang Jingwei has been permanently expelled from the party, the Central Government has not yet issued an arrest warrant. It is reported here that Wang has arrived in Shanghai and there is a rumor that he will go to Nanjing to join the × organization. Wang also intends to move some central executive and supervisory committee members to hold the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang on his own, but since Wang has been expelled from the party, he has no ability to call for it.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 2nd] According to unconfirmed sources, Doihara arrived in Hong Kong yesterday to meet with Wang Jingwei, planning to ask Wang Jingwei to go to Peiping to quickly take up a puppet position. The political circles here are paying close attention to Wang's future whereabouts. It is reported that Wang's actions are no more than three lines: one is to stay in Hong Kong temporarily, one is to go to Peiping immediately, and one is to sneak to Europe. Some people believe that it is very likely that Wang will go to Peiping, because Wang exchanged views with Wu Peifu on "peace" before leaving Chongqing. Wang's declaration in Hong Kong is especially considered to be the prelude to his plan to go to Peiping to take office. But if Wang's request is not fulfilled, he will go to Europe, either France or Germany.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 3rd] According to Chinese reports, Wang Jingwei is in Hong Kong, and is protected by a large number of Japanese plainclothes special agents for fear of being assassinated. He is currently busy meeting with the Japanese special agent organization Doihara and the Japanese consul, and is also discussing with Wu Peifu, Yin Tong, etc., to connect the puppet organizations in Peiping, Nanjing, Hankou, and Guangzhou to form a central government, with Peiping as the "capital," Wang as the "president," Wu Peifu as the chairman of the "Military Affairs Committee," and Jin Yunpeng as the "prime minister."

Wang's Defection Insignificant

[Reuters, London, 3rd] The London Stock Exchange closing showed that Wang Jingwei's defection had no impact on Far East stock prices. Several observers in London predict that Wang will be questioned by some in the business community, but it will be proven in the future that Wang's actions were wrong. Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi declared to Reuters, "Wang Jingwei's move is extremely regrettable, but it has no impact on China's resolute and consistent policy."

[Reuters, London, 3rd] The Birmingham Post said, "According to the information we have obtained, the Japanese are dreaming. They are plotting for Wang Jingwei's defection to be the collapse of China's unity. The fact is that it is greatly wrong. The purge of Wang and his party members is a sign of the strengthening and unity of the current authorities. The defection of Wang from the government side will not affect the morale of the Chinese people in any way to Wang's compromise plan."

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd] After Wang Jingwei telegraphed the central government, suggesting that it accept the Japanese army's peace negotiation conditions, the newspapers here unanimously expressed their patriotic enthusiasm and launched a massive attack on Wang, believing that he was a traitor to the country. The Communist Party's mouthpiece, Xinhua Daily, said that Wang, the former chairman of the Central Political Council, was a traitor to the country and should be dismissed from his official position to strengthen China's resistance. Xin Sheng Bao called Wang an inferior person, and Sao Dang Bao said that Wang's actions were unforgivable.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 3rd] According to political sources, telegrams from all over the country and overseas Chinese have been pouring in, unanimously supporting the government's decision to expel Wang Jingwei from the party, and said that since Wang left Chongqing, fortunately the government has taken this prompt action to eliminate various rumors immediately.

### Joint Statement by the Central Propaganda Department and the Political Department, Announcing to China and Abroad

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 1st] Today, the Central Propaganda Department and the Political Department issued (A) a statement to foreign countries and (B) instructions to party departments at all levels and political training personnel in the armed forces regarding Wang Zhaoming's serious violation of discipline and harm to the party and the country. Key points are recorded as follows:

Statement to Foreign Countries: (1) Wang's departure from the country this time for medical treatment was not disclosed to comrades in the country beforehand, nor was a formal letter sent afterward. It is clear that this was a purely personal action and has no connection whatsoever with the party, government, or military. His actions abroad cannot be regarded as representing any aspect. The leader has already made a solemn statement in the newspapers. (2) Wang's declaration can only represent his personal opinion, or the cowardly and despicable psychology of a very small number of weak-willed individuals who are willing to be utilized by ×. It will not have any impact on the overall future of the war of resistance. Wang's personal opinion is insufficient to shake the firm determination of the military and civilians nationwide to resist the war. (3) As for the Sino-Japanese issue, it is not a matter of a single day or two, let alone a matter for one or two individuals. The central government's decision to resist the war is in accordance with the instructions of the Premier's will and is based on the unanimous demands of the people nationwide. Therefore, resisting the war is our country's fixed national policy, which cannot be easily shaken or changed by the dissenting views of one or two individuals. (4) Wang's statement is probably temporarily deceived by the cunning of ×. However, Konoe's fallacious remarks about Wang are all conspiracies to destroy China. Even if Konoe's statement has the minimum sincerity, it proves that the × is exhausted and has reached the end of its rope. We should actively fight back, recover lost territory, and complete the final victory. How can we seek compromise halfway at this time? (5) Facts prove that the recent peace-seeking smoke screen of × is entirely for a new offensive. Konoe's statement can be said to be a kind of manipulation of Wang. (6) Historically, when revolutions in various countries are about to succeed, there often occur elements who attempt to compromise halfway and defect from the revolution. This is an unavoidable phenomenon in the revolutionary process. Not to mention the distant past, but recently, such as those who defected from the party and supported Yuan Shikai in the early Republic, and Chen Jiongming's betrayal of the Premier, are all exceptions. However, these are still personal actions, not a division of the revolutionary camp. In fact, the revolutionary forces will inevitably become more united and stronger because of this, and its development and success will be more assured. Today, when our great war of resistance is at hand, we must be of one heart and one mind, obey the supreme leader, and be determined to resist the war to the end, without being slackened by the ×'s provocation and alienation.

Internal Instructions: (1) Resisting the war is our party's established national policy, which will not be easily changed due to the dissenting opinions of one or two comrades. The central government's decision to resist the war is not a matter of a single day or two, and there is a basis for it in our party's historical documents. (A) The Premier's will and instructions have long foreseen that the completion of the national revolution cannot be achieved without resisting the war to seek national independence, freedom, and equality. (B) Declarations and resolutions of previous party congresses have all stated that when the nation is on the verge of extinction and peace has reached its last juncture, the entire nation must resolutely fight to resist foreign aggression and must not compromise halfway and hasten its own demise. (2) Wang's public declaration on December 29 last year was an act of betrayal against the party and the country. First, Wang, as the vice president, violated party discipline and went against the party's declarations and resolutions. How can he face the spirit of the Premier in heaven and the millions of soldiers and civilians who died in the war of resistance? Second, since the September 18th Incident, Wang has strongly advocated sincere unity to overcome national difficulties together. After the Lugouqiao Incident, he even more firmly advocated a long-term war of resistance. At the Provisional National Congress, he also enthusiastically supported the program of resisting the war and building the country. He never had different opinions on the war of resistance. Now, at the most critical juncture of the war of resistance, he suddenly issued such a declaration. The contradiction between his past and present actions is so great. (3) The content of Wang's declaration clearly shows that he has surrendered to Japanese imperialism and acknowledged its conditions for destroying China. Subjectively, Wang may not be willing to please Japan and echo the traitors, but objectively, he clearly belongs to surrendering to the × and betraying the motherland. In our revolutionary history, he will forever be the greatest stain. However, we still hope that Wang will repent. (4) However, Wang's departure from the revolution will objectively make us more united and determined in resisting the war. Therefore, Wang's actions will not have any impact on the party and the country. In addition to having one more tool for creating rumors and deceptions, it will not have any effect on ×. Only Wang's personal loss is the self-destruction of his revolutionary history and betrayal of the people and comrades of the whole country. This is most regrettable. However, we must go further and advance the second phase of the war of resistance, eliminate internal troubles, and firmly persist in dealing with × to the end. The final victory can be expected.

### Zhou Zuoren Assassinated in Beiping, Assailants Fled

[Beiping, Associated Press, 3rd] Zhou Zuoren, a famous Chinese writer, was seriously injured by gunfire from two youths today. When the two youths arrived at Zhou's residence, Zhou was only talking with his colleague. Then the two youths each fired a shot at Zhou, immediately turned around and fled. When they reached the outside of the door, they were stopped by two rickshaw pullers. The two youths then fired at the rickshaw pullers, seriously injuring one of them. As of the dispatch, the fugitives have not been apprehended. Zhou was previously a professor at Peking University. After the fall of Beiping, he did not leave and still taught at Yenching University, which is run by Americans, last spring. Some say he is collaborating with the Japanese, but there is no evidence to prove it.

### American Merchants in China Advocate Economic Sanctions Against Japan, Appeal Sent to US Government

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 3rd] Shanghai Dispatch: The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai yesterday telegraphed the U.S. government, requesting economic sanctions against Japan to safeguard the Open Door Policy. The American Chambers of Commerce in Qingdao and Tianjin will also submit similar requests immediately. [London, Reuters, 3rd] The Financial News here today stated that the United States' strong stance against Japan's actions in China, and its allowance of credit loans to China for the import of goods, greatly encourages those in China with financial and commercial interests. The United States has finally taken a firm stand. The US credit loan, followed by the British credit loan, although small in number, is extremely important from the perspective of the Chinese morale. This situation is still at stake. The war is still going on, so it is not too late for the United States and Britain to assist China as a decisive factor in the fight to restore the authority of the Chinese government and rebuild China's Open Door Policy. Those whose interests are affected in China should study this matter in detail and pay particular attention to the need for swift action. Recent observers are deeply impressed that China's determination to resist has been further strengthened due to the initial expressions of economic assistance from the United States and Britain.

### Jixian Falls, × Showing Signs of Crossing the River

[Xiangning, Ming Ge News Agency, 3rd] About a regiment of × attacked from the north of Xiangning and captured Jixian County on the morning of the 31st. In the afternoon, a part of the × advanced westward, showing signs of attacking the Yellow River line. On the morning of the 1st, there was fierce fighting between the × and our forces in the area 20 miles west of Jixian County at Guantoushan. It is reported that this route was intercepted by a certain unit of our army, killing and wounding dozens of ×. On the afternoon of the 1st, they still fled to Jixian County. As of now, the × only occupy the mountains near the city, and there is no trace of × more than ten miles away. Certain units of our army have been divided by the north and south mountains to encircle ×, and the river defense forces are also well equipped.

### International Anti-Aggression League Scheduled to Meet at the End of This Month

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 2nd] The Chinese branch of the International Anti-Aggression League recently received a telegram from the Geneva headquarters stating that the headquarters is scheduled to hold a representative conference in London on the 28th and 29th of this month. It is heard that our country's branch has actively prepared various proposals, and the delegation of the branch stationed in Europe will be responsible for attending at that time.

### Fate of Traitors: Pseudo-Rebels Captured Alive by Our Guerrilla in Baihe Township, Jiujiang

[Wanjiabu, Central News Agency, 2nd] Yang Xingshi, chairman of the pseudo-autonomous maintenance committee of Baitai Township, Jiujiang, Yang Youcheng, chief of the pseudo-general affairs section, and Duan Fugan, chief of the pseudo-police station, were captured by a guerrilla unit of our army and are currently under interrogation.

### Fisheries Scum Join the Pseudo-Market in Shanghai

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 2nd] Shanghai Dispatch: The Bank Real Estate Department previously established a loan syndicate in Shanghai with the banking community to develop coastal fisheries, and issued huge loans, stipulating that they should be repaid on time. Due to the outbreak of the war, the loans could not be repaid on time. The syndicate sympathized with the difficulties of the merchants and gave them an extension. It is now learned that a small number of fisheries scum have gathered funds to join the pseudo-fisheries market and to buy shares of the so-called Central China Aquatic Products Association. This kind of behavior is utterly conscienceless. The syndicate and others will never be lenient, and the government will be asked to severely punish these fishermen.

### Shanghai and Tianjin Telegrams Not Working

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 3rd] Shanghai Dispatch: As of the 3rd, wired and wireless telegrams between Shanghai and Tianjin are not working.

### Yellow River Disaster Severe: Canal Water Level Soars, Northern Jiangsu May Submerge

[Shanghai, Reuters, 3rd] According to the International Relief Committee, the great flood of the Yellow River, which has become rampant due to recent dike breaches, flows southeast, merges with the Huai River, and even turns the lakes and canals on the border between Anhui and Jiangsu into water. Then, slowly flowing east into the sea, this area of about 9,000 square miles and 9 million residents will be severely threatened if the Yellow River dikes are not repaired immediately to allow it to flow into the sea in a regular manner.

[Shanghai, Associated Press, 3rd] Foreign personnel in charge of disaster relief operations say that the Yellow River flood has not diminished. There is a danger that 9,000 square miles of land in northern Jiangsu will sink. The number of victims is no less than 12 million. In the Kaifeng area, there are two breaches in the dikes. The Yellow River water from one place flows along the old course of 1289, and the other flows along the old course of 1887. The water on both sides converges and bravely enters the Dahe River, and there is a danger of flooding in the reservoirs near the canal, because the mouth of the Yellow River has not been dredged, and the riverbed with dikes on both sides is higher than the ground.

Enslavement Education! × Forces Children to Learn Japanese in Occupied Areas (Contributed by Geng Ya)

### Symposium in Xiang-Gui Train, "Part One"

— Special Correspondent, Geng Ya

On a drizzly, chilly morning, I took a short car ride from Guilin City at lightning speed, and then transferred to the express train on the Xiang-Gui Railway, which had been actively built since the War of Resistance, heading north.

There are two reasons why I am very happy about this trip! One is: Recently, the war in the northern section of the Yue-Han Railway has changed from silence to our counter-offensive. Judging from the victorious reports, it is possible that when I arrive in the Changsha-Miluo area, it will be the time when our heroic soldiers recover Yueyang or nearby strongholds. Of course! We should not be proud of victories, because arrogance leads to defeat; but if one does not rejoice or feel happy when hearing about victories, it seems that this person is also highly suspected of being a traitor. Therefore, some people (including me) are overjoyed and keep talking about the victory of the counter-offensive in the northern section and the capture of famous cities in the outer circle of Guangzhou. I think this is a matter of reason and should not be criticized. Another reason: Since the transfer of troops from Shanghai, I personally have not seen a national railway spanning more than two provinces. For more than a year, I have not seen it. Now I am seeing the newly built ×× station of the Xiang-Gui Railway again, with its wide platform and long rails, one end is connected to the Xiang Province and the Yue-Han Railway, and the other end is accelerating its extension to the international community. On the railway tracks, there are all kinds of vehicles, new and old, and the locomotives have all been fired up, ready to continue to do their best for the war of resistance. On the walls of the station, there are also large inscriptions such as "If the × Bandits are not destroyed for a day, we will never have peace"; "Turn the ×'s rear into our front"; "Endure personal temporary pain, strive for national permanent freedom" and other slogans. These emerging, great, and powerful scenes make people feel an unspeakable joy and hope!

Although some people, from another point of view, cannot help but feel a little bitter, that is, from the handwriting on the cars parked on the tracks, they recognize that they are not cars from the Xiang-Gui Railway itself, but cars from the Jing-Hu, Hu-Hang-Yong, Zhe-Gan, Jin-Pu, Long-Hai, Jiao-Ji, Ping-Han, Jing-Feng (ie, old Bei-Ning cars) and other railways, because the railways themselves that these cars run on have unfortunately been occupied or cut off by the ×. Therefore, they (the vehicles) have fled to this road like refugees. Thinking of this, you will naturally feel a tragic impression of "the country is half-destroyed, the people are mostly displaced; the violent × enter quickly, and the bloodshed is endless," and then, continuing to think, you may even shed a few tears!

However, if you can see through the other side of the problem, you will naturally have a different understanding, making you turn your tears into a smile! The reason is very simple. Before the War of Resistance, these vehicles, so-called each thing has its owner, cannot run around without boundaries. Furthermore, some places deliberately made the tracks narrow in order to cut off contact with vehicles from other roads. But since the War of Resistance, all politics, military affairs, economy, and transportation have implemented a tangible and intangible great unity, implementing a united front. The strange phenomenon that vehicles from various roads cannot cross the boundary has also been swept away, and they can freely advance and retreat from the center of the war to various roads. Mr. Feng Yuxiang, Vice Chairman of the Military Commission, dares to inspect the streets in the southwest alone. Mr. Chen Cheng, Commander of a certain war zone, also tests the public's understanding of the war of resistance in the mountains of Guilin without regard to formality. People like Mr. Zhou Enlai, Deputy Minister of the Political Department, Mr. Ji Jianying, Chief of General Staff of the Eighth Route Army, Mr. Ye Ting, Commander of the New Fourth Army, and so on, are very casually attending various public and private banquets in various places. Every time reporters and friends inadvertently meet them, they all say in unison that this reflects a good phenomenon of consistent unity in the war of resistance and no internal problems. If we take the analogy of people as an example of material things, and the military vehicles of various roads can freely advance and retreat to the new roads, who can say that it is not a good phenomenon? Moreover, our war of resistance this time is a scorched-earth war, and we use the principle of fortifying walls and clearing the fields. For all public and private materials in the occupied areas, we should try our best to carry them out in advance. For example, when Wuhan was making a planned retreat, even a rickshaw had to be ordered to be dragged by the rickshaw puller to the Shashih-Yichang area; things that could not be taken away, such as the iron plates covering the gutters on the road, had to be sunk to the bottom of the river. In short, no useful objects were left to ×. We can safely evacuate the vehicles of various roads from the lost areas to the rear for use in a planned way. This not only contains the meaning of strengthening the walls and clearing the fields, but also prepares for the counter-offensive in the future, so that they can easily drive on familiar ground, and call them to transport heroic soldiers in separate ways and fight back to their old homes!

——That day, at the ×× station on the Xiang-Gui Road, some passengers, touched by the scene, sighed at those vehicles of great unity, probably no longer have to worry about nothing, right?

At night, when it was time to depart, with a whistle, the express train we were on——"Longhai" green steel skin car, a total of twelve sections including the locomotive, like a green-scaled swimming dragon, shook its head and wagged its tail and headed north.

The "Longhai" green steel skin car is as new, stable, and well-equipped as the blue steel skin car on the Jing-Hu Road before the War of Resistance. Now, far away on the Xiang-Gui Road, "borrowing high-quality materials," we can actually ride comfortably, which adds to the excitement of the passengers. Although it is now traveling on a newly built road with a promising future, because the roadbed is not yet very stable, the express train cannot really run very fast; although recently, the situation in this section of the war has turned better, and the refugees who fled from Hunan Province to Guilin are now packing up and returning north, making the seats particularly crowded; but the general passengers are at ease, and later the train has been running more than two or three times overtime, and I have not heard anyone utter half a complaint.

This express train, which runs every other day (of course, there are other ordinary express and freight trains), is particularly crowded in the third-class seats, and there is no room for foot in the second-class seats. The reporter bought a second-class ticket, but after all, due to the crowding, he could not get in. With the flexibility of the ticket inspector, he was able to move to the first-class dining car, which was not bad. The dining car only provides lunch: breakfast is all "soup and rice," which costs two yuan per plate; lunch and dinner have fried eggs, wonderful cabbage, stewed pork, stewed beef, radish , five dishes, each costing three yuan, plus white rice at two yuan per serving, you can eat as much as you want. This "five dishes and one soup rice" way of eating seems to have been reviewed by some department: it is the same every day, never changing. But the passengers are not foodies, so they are naturally happy to eat it. If your wallet is limited, you can also buy more affordable snacks to eat: soup noodles, porridge, cakes, steamed buns, etc., are all available for sale at each station. Spiced eggs and spiced dried tofu are also sold, and they are sold by people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but they taste a bit different. It is said that the spices cannot be bought completely. As for the roasted chicken sold by the ladies on the Jin-Pu and Ping-Han roads in the old days, two yuan can buy a fat roasted chicken, but there is no roasted chicken here; if you want to eat it, you can only actively prepare to recover the lost land.

The train is running and the long night is long. After chatting a few words with the passengers around you, everyone becomes friends who "regret not meeting each other sooner." There is an armed comrade named Duan, who is an anti-aircraft instructor at a military academy in a certain place. He said: "In the future, due to the shift in the war situation, the anti-aircraft defense of important cities in the southwest will naturally be strengthened day by day due to the concentration of anti-aircraft guns and other equipment. For example, when × planes bombed Guilin several times, they only dropped bombs horizontally at high altitude, and did not dare to drop bombs in a dive at low altitude, because they were afraid of inadvertently touching my anti-aircraft fire network, please let him come down to the land and visit the mountains and rivers of Guilin!"

Mr. Duan, in response to a passenger's question, also said: "Italy is really not a good friend. At first, she said sweet words, saying that she didn't want our Boxer Indemnity anymore; but to transfer this money to her to buy airplanes, as a result, we were a little fooled by him. Fortunately, our source of airplanes purchased from Italy only accounted for the smallest part, so we were fooled very little."

Another friend with a Jiangxi accent interjected: "Italy is not just not a good friend. In terms of their illegal behavior, they have long been the same as the Japanese fascist warlords. In other words, they are indeed accomplices of the Japanese warlords with the same smell. Many Italian missionaries in the interior are working as spies for the × side. The Italian priest in Laohekou has publicly admitted to providing information to the Japanese army. When Hankou was about to withdraw, an Italian priest in a certain church took in more than 2,000 male and female refugees. Eight hundred men were expelled, leaving only more than 1,200 women. They thought they could seek refuge without incident; but fortunately, a Chinese priest in the church righteously informed the outside, saying that the Italian priest was preparing to wait until the Japanese army arrived in Hankou, and wanted to play a trick of 'bringing thieves into the house' with the 1,200 refugee women, and offer them all to the Japanese army as a gift for the allies to see and reward. When the staff of the Third Hall of the Political Department heard the news, they quickly tried to rescue this group of female compatriots who were almost taken by the Italian priest to feast the tiger."

"They (referring to the Italian priests) are guilty after all!" The friend with the Jiangxi accent pushed open the car window, and a gust of cold wind first blew in, making everyone shiver. He spat a mouthful of phlegm outward, closed the car window again, and then said: "Recently, in Pingxiang, Jiangxi, an Italian missionary went to the countryside to preach. He used fluent Chinese and asked a group of children who were surrounding him, as if they were watching a play: 'Where are you from?' The group of children replied loudly: 'We are all Chinese!' He asked again: 'Who are you Chinese fighting with?' The group of children still said in unison: 'Fighting with the Japanese ×!' The priest smiled, seemingly still having something to ask; but a child had already asked him first: 'Foreigner, which country are you from?' The priest answered casually: 'I am Italian.' He would have been fine if he hadn't said he was Italian, but as soon as he said he was Italian, the group of children became a little different. Some clenched their small fists, and some puffed up their small mouths and said: 'Oh! I can't tell that you are still Italian. You Italians help the Japanese × to fight us. We are not patient to listen to your × words anymore. We want to beat you down!' At the same time, the priest's head was greeted with stones of unknown origin, scaring him to run back to the church quickly. He lay in bed in the middle of the night and thought: These rural children still know this, so the adults must be even more fierce! The more he thought about it, the more terrible he felt, as if the locals were about to ask him to really go see God! He couldn't fall asleep, and as a result, he was forced to get up and ask the local authorities for protection in the middle of the night. The next day, he was escorted out of the country..."
