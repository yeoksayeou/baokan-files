### The Responsibility of China and the Soviet Union for World Peace

For over twenty months, the Japanese war of aggression against China has, due to our China's staunch resistance, created a dilemma for Japan. This is a fact already understood by the whole world and needs no further detailed explanation. Recently, on February 10th, Japan suddenly changed direction and attacked Hainan Island. This move exposes the deeper layers of the Japanese militarists' ambition. Hainan Island is an island off the southern end of China's Leizhou Peninsula, similar in size to Taiwan, about a hundred miles from Annam, and about forty miles from Guangzhou Bay, facing the South China Sea and opposite the Philippines. Its location is sufficient to control the South China Sea and the Gulf of Tonkin, and to cut off the passage between Hong Kong and Singapore. From Japan's point of view, Japan must pass through Hainan Island to reach Australia, Southeast Asia, India, and even Europe. Therefore, Japan has been scheming to acquire Hainan Island as a gateway for Japan to the south, in order to control Annam, India, Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and even Honolulu for decades, without ever letting go. This time, Japan's war of aggression against our country has expanded to its current state, based on the Japanese militarists' misjudgment of our country, which has consumed at least two-thirds of their land and air combat power, while our China has become stronger in fighting, which has already doomed their failure. Only because our country lacks a navy can he retain most of his naval power, which has not been used. This time, the attack on Hainan Island is on the one hand to use his remaining part of the force to make a final threat to our country, and on the other hand to take advantage of the unrest in Europe to provoke Britain and France. It can both support his allies Germany and Italy in Europe, and hope to complete the good dream of seizing Hainan Island and controlling the South Pacific for decades by chance. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said: "The Japanese army's incursion into Hainan Island this year is equivalent to the occupation of Shenyang on September 18, 1931. In other words, Japan's attack on Hainan Island is tantamount to creating a 'September 18th Incident' on the Pacific." This can be said to have pinpointed the ambition of the Japanese militarists. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese War has entered a new stage of significance. This new significance means that Japan has begun to attack the world.

The reason why I am now speaking to the people of the Soviet Union is that the Soviet Union is a peace-loving country. Not only does it love peace, but it also has the ambition to safeguard world peace. The Soviet Union's efforts in the League of Nations and other international aspects in recent years have been the most definite proof of this ambition. Our China is also a peace-loving country and also has the ambition to safeguard world peace. Unfortunately, our country has been shackled by imperialism for many years. After the Xinhai Revolution, for more than twenty years, it has not been able to actively develop, so it only holds this ambition, and its contribution to world peace is very small. This time, the Japanese imperialists launched a large-scale aggression against us for no reason. We spared no effort to use the flesh and blood of the whole country to make a strong and unyielding resistance, so that the imperialists clearly recognize that terms such as humanity and justice are not ethereal things after all; and the ambitious people who are strong and domineering will eventually eat their own fruits. The reasonable answer we have given to the Japanese imperialists can at least be said to have assumed the advanced position of safeguarding world peace. Since China and the Soviet Union are both peace-loving countries and both have the ambition to safeguard world peace, and they also have deep relations in geography and history, it is necessary to make joint efforts to realize the common ambitions of China and the Soviet Union. In the past twenty months, Japan has attacked China, and the Soviet government and people have given China great sympathy and assistance. Now that Japan has begun its new meaning of aggression and is attacking the world, the tasks of China and the Soviet Union are even more important. I believe that the Soviet government and people will also pay more attention to this new meaning of Japanese aggression.

Japan is an island nation in the western Pacific. Fifty years ago, it was an invaded country like China. It only began to gain international status after winning the Sino-Japanese War in 1894. Later, it used Britain to form the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and then launched the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, defeating Imperial Russia. The success of these two attempts actually led Japan into a state of madness, scheming to complete its so-called dream of a continental policy. The content and purpose of the Guandong Continental Policy were most clearly stated in Tanaka Giichi's memorial. Tanaka's memorial said: "If we want to control China in the future, we must first defeat the United States. This is very similar to the significance of the Russo-Japanese War. However if we want to conquer China, we must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia. If we want to conquer world, we must first conquer China. If China can be completely conquered by us, others such as Asia Minor, India, Nanyang, etc., will respect me and even surrender to me. So that the world knows that East Asia is East Asia of my country, and will never dare to invade me. This is the legacy of Emperor Meiji, and it is also something that our Japanese Empire must do for its survival." However, Japan's continental policy is a policy of conquering the world. Originally, the Anglo-Japanese Alliance for thirty years (from 1902 to 1921), the first half was against Russia, and the second half was against the United States. Because Japan's policy of conquering the world takes conquering China as the first step. In the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, Russia interfered and retreated from the Liaodong Peninsula, which the Japanese hated to the core. After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan had seen through the emptiness of the content of Imperial Russia and was not deeply afraid; and the United States happened to have the idea of maintaining China's open door, which dealt a major blow to Japan's ambition to annex China alone. Therefore, in this period, Japan desperately pulled Britain to support itself, in order to cope with its obstacles to annexing China alone! Russia and the United States are the targets. At the Washington Conference in 1921, although the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was cancelled due to the pressure of the United States, Japan took advantage of the fact that all countries were not available to look to the East during the European War and had obtained many special interests from China and other aspects, and its wings had been formed. Therefore, in recent years, it has ignored everything and directly attacked our country, especially after the September 18th Incident. However, our country is not a country that can be despised lightly. It has a national history of five thousand years, and the progress of the revolutionary movement in recent years has promoted everything in our country to a new stage, clearly recognizing its own mission for its own country and nation, and for the world; and will never allow aggressors to be so rampant. Therefore, from the first cannon shot at Lugou Bridge, we immediately mobilized national human and material resources to resist. It is of course to protect the independence and survival of our own country and nation, but also to fight for world peace.

What I want to explain now is that Japan's consistent dream of conquering the world has not been awakened by the blows that our country has given him in the past twenty months. The recent change of direction and attack on the world is clear evidence. However, judging from Japan's national strength and the international situation it is in, it is just a desperate gamble. Judging from Japan's national strength, at the time of the current tense situation in Europe, it is daring to make a risky attempt on the British and French navies in the Far East with its remaining naval power. In terms of the international situation, although Germany and Italy are known as his allies, they are caught in the changes in the European situation and have a shallow relationship with the Far East, and they may not be willing or even have the strength to support Japan. Moreover, Japan's own contradictions have been stretched to the point of exhaustion. Even if he takes the risk of the world's great disapproval and launches an attack on the world, his future is unimaginable. We know that only peace is the true gospel of mankind. Now that most of the countries in the world, even including the people ruled by a few ambitious people, are standing on the line of peace, we can assert that humanity and justice are ultimately indelible terms, and that world peace will eventually be realized one day.

Who should bear the responsibility for realizing world peace? Our China and the Japanese aggressors have been dealing with each other for more than twenty months, and have actually eliminated two-thirds of the power of the Japanese army and air force. This has of course given a very serious blow to the Japanese imperialists. The Soviet Union is geographically in close contact with Japan, and its love of peace and its ambition to safeguard world peace are the same as those of China; in terms of national strength, it also has substantial strength, at least in the situation of storms and rains in the Far East, it stands in a very important position. At present, the path of the Japanese imperialists' challenge to the world seems to have a trend of heading south from attacking Hainan Island, but from his consistent ambition to conquer the world, both southward and northward advances are just a matter of procedure. In order to uphold humanity and justice, and to maintain world peace, we will never allow such ambitious people to exist, and there is no need to pay attention to the direction of his first attack. We only hope that all peace-loving countries and people in the world will jointly take the responsibility of giving blows to the blowers; and in the current time when the flames of war are raging in the Far East, it is especially hoped that the Soviet Union, which has close ties with the Far East.

### World Trends of the Week From May 14th to 20th, Year 28

— Pan Lang

The world situation this week can be aptly described as "spring clouds beginning to unfold," bringing us much heartening news. The most important aspects are the continued progress in Anglo-Soviet negotiations, the strengthening of Anglo-American friendship, the demonstrative actions taken by Britain, the United States, and France regarding the Gulangyu and Shanghai concession incidents, and the enthusiastic global support for China and boycott of Japan. Moreover, our ongoing War of Resistance against Japan has seen new victories, particularly those of our forces in central Hubei and northern China, inflicting severe blows on the Japanese forces.

On the other hand, the fascist aggressor nations of Germany and Italy are still preparing for further speculative and adventurous wars. The Japanese fascists in the Far East, in a state of extreme distress and boredom, have begun to make overtures to Britain and the United States, while secretly preparing for even more ruthless offensives. However, generally speaking, with the anti-aggression movement becoming increasingly consolidated and developed, fascist aggressors are indeed encountering difficulties they never imagined. If we can make greater efforts to overcome the remaining weaknesses within the anti-aggression front, intensify the practical struggle against aggression, and increase the internal and external difficulties and threats to the aggressors, then a second world war can still be averted, and the genuine peace we seek can be realized sooner!

(1) Progress of the Anti-Aggression Movement

The anti-fascist, anti-aggression movement has made significant progress this week, manifested in concrete facts: First, the British and Turkish authorities jointly announced on the 12th their decision to establish an agreement. The specific terms of this agreement are said to be still under negotiation, but in principle, should any act of aggression lead to war in the Mediterranean region, Britain and Turkey are prepared for effective cooperation, providing each other with all assistance and supplies. Following this news, there are rumors of a Franco-Turkish mutual assistance agreement being announced soon, which comes from the French side, so the credibility is naturally high. On the 17th, news of a secret agreement between the Soviet Union and Turkey also spread around the world, reportedly containing the following: (1) Any act of aggression sufficient to disrupt the status quo in the Balkan Peninsula will be jointly opposed by the Soviet Union and Turkey; (2) If war breaks out, the Soviet Union and Turkey should cooperate to deal with it with all resources and strength. Turkey, geographically, not only controls the key to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea but also controls the Eurasian transportation artery from the Mediterranean Sea via the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean. The close alliance of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Turkey against aggression is of great significance not only for Southeast Europe and the Near East but also for the Far East and the entire world. Second, the negotiations for mutual assistance between Britain and the Soviet Union, after a period of stalemate, have shown progress again this week. After British Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky on the 17th, the British response to the Soviet Union was sent to Moscow on the 18th. It is said that Britain has accepted the proposal of mutual assistance in principle, agreeing to assist the Soviet Union when it is attacked for defending Poland, Romania, and Turkey, that is, to supply the Soviet Union with the military and financial resources of Britain and France. However, Britain refuses to extend the guarantee to the Baltic Sea region at present. The Soviet Union immediately replied to the British on the 19th, insisting that a tripartite mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union be concluded first, to guarantee the countries of Eastern Europe, to avoid giving fascist aggressors an opportunity, and to prevent Britain's anti-aggression movement from becoming a deceitful fraud. Now, far-sighted politicians in Britain and the French authorities are urging the British government to conclude an agreement as soon as possible, and a clearer conclusion is expected next week. Third, the friendly relationship between Britain and the United States continues to grow. In the past few days, the King and Queen of England have been very popular in Canada, with cheers resounding throughout the day, and the American people have unanimously responded to British public opinion, hoping that the visit of the King and Queen of England to Canada and the United States will enhance the friendly relationship between Britain and the Americas. At the same time, the British government is also determined to implement barter trade between Britain and the United States to promote the friendly relations between the two countries. British-American cooperation is of great significance for Europe, especially for the Far East, and we must strive to achieve it.

(2) New Activities of Germany, Italy, and Japan

Fascist aggressors have new activities. On the one hand, they are intensifying their efforts to undermine the anti-fascist, anti-aggression movement, and on the other hand, they are stepping up the deployment of a new imperialist war. (1) Regarding the former, they have adopted two methods. First, they are still inciting and colluding with small countries. Recently, this has been manifested in the fact that Italy is instigating conflicts between Bulgaria and Greece and Yugoslavia (see the Hai Tong News Agency's Budapest dispatch on the 13th); Italy is colluding with Yugoslavia (see the Hai Tong News Agency's Rome dispatch on the 13th, "Yugoslav Regent Meets the Pope"); provoking disputes between Bulgaria and Romania and taking the opportunity to win them over (see the Reuters London dispatch on the 13th); Germany and Italy are making every effort to acquire Romania commercially (see the Hai Tong News Agency's Berlin dispatch on the 14th: "German-Romanian Commercial Agreement Has Been Established," Reuters Rome dispatch on the 18th: "Italian-Romanian Agreement on Exchange of Goods Has Been Established"); and luring Yugoslavia to join the German-Italian axis (see the 19th [source missing]). Although attempts to persuade Finland, Sweden, and Norway have been thwarted (Reuters reported on the 17th that the three countries rejected Germany's proposal), negotiations with Denmark, Estonia, and Latvia are said to be "completed" (see Reuters Berlin dispatch on the 18th). Second, they are disrupting negotiations on a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the United States, and concentrating their efforts on inciting and threatening the stubborn and reactionary elements within the British government. The fact that Britain has not yet been able to sincerely conclude a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union is due in no small part to the obstruction of stubborn and reactionary elements. Recently, Japan has even begun to make overtures to Britain and the United States. The British House of Commons discussed the incident on the 17th when Japan attempted to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Britain. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita even expressed Japan's "sincerity" in resolving the US-Japan issue without hindering American interests in China when bidding farewell to the US Ambassador to Japan on the 18th and advised the United States not to adopt international cooperation and other forms. (2) Regarding the latter, this week, it has been manifested in the fact that the German-Italian axis is strengthening its solidarity. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will arrive in Berlin today (the 21st) and is scheduled to formally sign a political and military agreement tomorrow. After the military agreement is signed, King Emmanuel of Italy will also go to Berlin to strengthen the unity of the aggressor axis. Berlin is preparing a grand welcome. Second, Germany's threat to Poland is becoming more serious. A large number of German troops have already been concentrated in the Moravian region on the Polish border; according to a Havas News Agency London dispatch on the 18th, thousands of German Nazi troops, including 3,000 members of Hitler's guard, have secretly infiltrated Danzig. Another report says that as many as 20,000 German troops have arrived in Danzig. Third, Hitler and Mussolini both inspected the defense lines along the French border on the 16th. Military engineering projects in both countries are currently being rushed to completion. Fourth, they are preparing to conclude a military alliance with Spain, and in practice, they are preparing to intensify military work on the Spanish-French border and in Gibraltar, preparing to threaten Britain and France. On the 19th, Spain held a celebration of "victory" under the instigation of Germany and Italy, which can be seen as a demonstration by the aggressors against the democratic and peaceful countries of Britain, France, and the United States, and a cruel sneer at all hypocritical and cowardly policies of appeasement!

In summary, this week's events show that fascist aggression has indeed encountered new difficulties, but they are carrying out more cruel and vicious conspiracies!

(3) Major Demonstrations by Britain, the United States, and France Against Japan

Following the progress of the anti-aggression movement and the increasingly rampant speculation and adventurism in the Far East, democratic and peaceful countries such as Britain, the United States, and France have finally taken relatively tough steps to deal with Japanese provocations. The first step is to deal with the Japanese occupation of Gulangyu. On the 17th, warships from Britain, the United States, and France stationed in the Far East each sent sailors to land on Gulangyu. The total number was evenly matched with the Japanese sailors who landed there. British Navy Commander Noble issued a serious warning to the Japanese authorities that there should be no changes to the Gulangyu Municipal Council. It is now reported that the Japanese sailors have secretly withdrawn from the area. The second step is to deal with Japan's preparation to seize the concessions in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou. On the 19th, the British, American, and French authorities implemented emergency martial law in the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession. Troops, detectives, and the International Settlement Volunteer Corps were fully mobilized, and barbed wire fences were added everywhere in the concession, as if facing a major event. Before the Japanese launched an armed seizure, they carried out a major demonstration against Japan. This emergency action can be said to be the first powerful and concerted response from Britain, the United States, and France since Japan implemented a comprehensive rejection of European and American powers in the Far East, this response showed the firm opposition of Britain, the United States, and France to Japan's so-called "New Order in East Asia" and the determination to defend their rights and interests in China and the Far East. No wonder the Japanese authorities were alarmed when they heard about it - Japanese newspapers have expressed panic in their articles these days, and the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs even declared on the 19th that this matter was "extremely regrettable"! However, we still need to clearly point out three points here: First, Japan's plan to seize concessions and exclude European and American powers in the Far East is based on the necessity of the development of Japanese capitalist imperialism and its national policy of establishing hegemony in East Asia. In the future, conflicts with European and American powers will only develop and are difficult to reconcile. Today, in order to solve its serious military, political, and economic difficulties in invading China, it will intensify its seizure steps, and unless it suffers a fatal blow, it will never stop or back down. Second, the current joint action and demonstration by Britain, the United States, and France are not yet powerful enough to give Japan a fatal blow, and actions such as banning the Yi Bao, Wen Hui, Da Mei, and Sino-American newspapers that aid China, as well as various interferences with all legitimate patriotic speech and actions of the Chinese people, such as hanging national flags, are [remainder of sentence missing due to garbled text]. Third, for the sake of the interests of Britain, the United States, France, and other friendly nations and the true peace of the Far East, today, after continuing to demonstrate against Japan, all friendly nations should immediately further negotiate close political, military, and economic cooperation and take broader and more practical steps to support China and boycott Japan, pressuring Japan to abandon its speculative and adventurous fascist aggression policy. To demand its effective success, the first thing is to achieve a decisive victory in China's War of Resistance against Japan. Without the victory of China's War of Resistance as a basis, all guarantees of peace cannot exist in isolation.

(4) The International Aid China Movement is Enthusiastic

The progress of the anti-fascist, anti-aggression movement is actually of great help to our country's War of Resistance and national construction. At present, the Soviet Union's firm advocacy of concluding a tripartite mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, its firm advocacy that the anti-aggression front should include the Far East, and its efforts to cooperate with countries in the Near East and the United States are all of great help to our War of Resistance and national construction. In addition, in the past week, the international Aid China movement has also had new manifestations. On the American side, our Zhenwei Association representative, Bishop Yu Bin, was warmly welcomed by overseas Chinese and people from all walks of life in the United States. Bishop Yu's anti-war propaganda work has been extremely successful. Archbishop Doherty of Philadelphia, one of the three major archbishops in the United States, initiated a welcome for Bishop Yu and instructed all parishioners in the region to do their best to help and rescue Chinese refugees. According to a Havas News Agency Washington dispatch on the 16th, the US Congress has a very friendly attitude towards China and will never pass any Neutrality Act or other legislation that would hinder China's War of Resistance. As for the broad masses of American workers, they are unanimously willing to fight to aid China's War of Resistance and sanction Japanese aggression. In Britain, the Aid China movement has been particularly enthusiastic recently. A delegation composed of three nobles, Snell, Cecil, and Listowel, visited Foreign Secretary Halifax on the 19th, urging the British government to use all its power at the Geneva Conference to ensure that the League of Nations takes active action to aid China. The British Parliament has held enthusiastic discussions on aiding China and boycotting Japan in recent days. The Sino-British Cultural Association held its fourth annual meeting in Chongqing on the 16th. British Chairman Karl gave a speech, admiring the spirit of our people in persisting in the War of Resistance and believing that the relationship between China and Britain will become increasingly close. The French side has also become more firm in its attitude towards Japan. According to a message from the French Embassy in Chongqing on the 19th, a French government delegation has come to the East to investigate the conversion of coastal defenses into free ports and will allow the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to provide various facilities for large-scale transportation. In addition, countries have unanimously condemned the recent atrocities of Japanese aircraft in China. People from all walks of life in the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and other countries have successively sent messages of condolence. Sir Cecil, chairman of the Anti-Aggression General Association, also sent a message of condolence and expressed his respect to us for our unified and heroic War of Resistance, and said that he firmly believes that the [Japanese] will be defeated by us, urging our country to strengthen unity and persist in the protracted War of Resistance.

The enthusiastic aid to China from international figures is the result of our heroic persistence for twenty-two months. In the future, we must of course unite and persist in the War of Resistance even more, to win more and greater sympathy and assistance from the international community, and to realize the victory of the War of Resistance ahead of schedule. However, when we look back at past foreign propaganda, especially national diplomacy, it is indeed still very insufficient. At present, the War of Resistance has entered a new and critical stage, and we cannot but double our efforts in this regard. The League of Nations Executive Council meeting is approaching, and our Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Guo Taiqi, and Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Maisky, went to Geneva together on the 19th. When they passed through Paris, they will attend together with our Ambassador to France, Gu Weijun, on behalf of our country. Today, we highly urge the government to [remainder of sentence missing due to garbled text] our representatives to redouble their efforts. On the one hand, they must carry out national diplomacy and promote [remainder of sentence missing due to garbled text] representatives attending to achieve the goal of all countries implementing effective pressure on Japan and providing practical assistance to our country!

(5) The Situation of the War of Resistance Against Japan This Week

The focus of the war this week is still in the Hubei-Henan area, especially in the area east of Xiangyang and Fancheng in Hubei, but the fighting is also very fierce in North China and East China, especially in various parts of North China. The fighting in South China is still fiercely ongoing in the Pearl River Delta, but neither side has made significant progress. Over the past week, our troops in Hubei and Henan have won successive battles, not only shattering the Japanese's delusional "encirclement of our twenty divisions," but also inflicting a total of 17,000 to 18,000 casualties on the Japanese forces after two weeks of bloody battles in northern Hubei and southern Henan, reaching one-third of the total strength of their main invading forces in central China. According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Luoyang on the 15th, our army's recapture of Tanghe this time resulted in the killing or wounding of thousands of Japanese troops in just one night of fierce fighting! Now, the Japanese plan to invade Xiangfan has been largely crushed. Our army in Hubei and Henan has realized active operations, controlling the overall situation, and continuing to fight fiercely with the Japanese in the area north of Suizhou and Zaoyang and south of Tongbai and Xinye. The situation is already optimistic. Second, in North China, our army has won another major victory this week. According to a Reuters dispatch from Peiping on the 18th, the various detachments of our Eighth Route Army advancing into Rehe Province are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. In the central region of Hebei Province, the strength of the guerrillas has increased even more against the Japanese, and the Japanese army that invaded these areas this spring has been forced to completely withdraw. Although some villages east of the Pinghan Railway are still occupied by the Japanese army, they have been trapped and have lost the ability to control various places. The war in Suiyuan has also been very fierce recently, and nearly a thousand Japanese have been killed in two weeks during April and May. The fighting on the PingSui and PingHan railways has also continued. The war on the eastern front has also made progress. Our army in northern Jiangsu broke into Xuzhou again on the evening of the 16th and burned down the Japanese puppet organs. Along the Jinpu, Huhang, Sujia, Jinghang, and Jingwu lines, wars also occur from time to time. For example, our army in the area between the Huhang and Sujia roads broke into Tongxiang on the evening of the 15th and severely suppressed the Japanese. On the southern front, after General Bai Chongxi, Director of the General Staff, inspected northern Guangdong and held an important meeting last week, further counter-offensive military operations have been gradually launched. According to a dispatch from Shaoguan on the 19th, our army in Guangdong is now counter-attacking on one hand and strengthening its forces on the other. The Japanese army in Dongjiang has achieved nothing, and anti-war incidents have occurred frequently among the Japanese in Beijiang. The Japanese in Zengcheng and Conghua have often been suspected, disarmed, and detained. In the lower reaches of the Xijiang River, the Japanese have not yet withdrawn. Although the fierce battle in Jianghui has resulted in the capture and recapture of the city, it is still under our control. Our army near Jiangmen has even advanced to Duruancun. The Japanese in the Pearl River Delta, without reinforcements continuing to arrive, have obviously become exhausted.

Looking at the overall situation, although the Japanese have tried their best to covet Xiangfan in order to lay the foundation for their advance into the Northwest, their military strength is still unable to carry out a new large-scale offensive, and various difficulties continue to increase. Therefore, their main purpose is still to passively try to attack our front-line counter-offensive, strengthen their control and rule over the occupied areas, and prepare for a large-scale offensive in the future. The Japanese's attempt to seize concessions in Shanghai and other places and land in Gulangyu is not only to exclude European and American powers in the Far East, but also to give a political and economic blow to our post-defeat battles and facilitate their control over the occupied areas. In the future, the Japanese seem likely to launch large-scale offensives on the PingHan, YueHan railways, and the Chaoshan-Shaoguan-XiangGui roads.

There are two points that we cannot ignore here: First, regarding Japan, we must also estimate that there are now three forces preventing the Japanese from advancing: First, the enhanced combat effectiveness of our front-line troops; second, the joint demonstration against Japan by Britain, the United States, and France; and third, the severity of Japan's economic crisis. As for us, we must also estimate that at a time when the internal and external situation is becoming increasingly favorable, there are still many obstacles, namely, (1) Although Wang Jingwei's [remainder of sentence missing due to garbled text] actions have failed, the erroneous ideas of compromise and [remainder of sentence missing due to garbled text] of all Wang's faction, wavering elements, and stubborn elements have not yet been completely eliminated, so spiritual mobilization, unity, protracted war of resistance, still need to be more extensive and in-depth propaganda. (2) The continued existence and development of the forces and tendencies that [remainder of sentence missing due to garbled text] total mobilization of national strength and the international Aid China boycott Japan movement is also a fact that needs to be paid close attention to in the new and serious stage of the current War of Resistance. We must step up the promotion of political progress to realize the democratic spirit, improve the people's livelihood, and expand international propaganda as the basic work for winning victory. For example, the National Production Conference, which ended this week, requires that its resolutions be seriously implemented and that production and construction be effectively increased to support the War of Resistance and national construction. It is impossible to ignore the above-mentioned basic work!

### Our Army Advances on Multiple Routes in Sui and Zao, Recapturing Numerous Strongholds on the East Bank of the Xiang River; The Situation in Southern Henan Remains Tense with Fierce Fighting

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 20th] The × offensive in central Hubei and southern Henan has weakened, and the overall situation has shifted under our control. All villages and towns between Zhangjiaji and Xiaohongshan on the east bank of the Xiang River have been recaptured, and we are mopping up the remaining × forces. There was fierce fighting between our forces and the × forces between Zhongxiang and Changshoudian, resulting in significant gains. In the Sui County and Zao Yang area, the × forces are still resisting stubbornly. Our army is advancing on multiple routes, and the war situation is improving.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] The war in central Hubei in the past few days was extremely fierce. Both Chinese and Japanese forces suffered heavy casualties in Gucheng, Jingmen, Yicheng, Fancheng, and Huang'an. Currently, the first line of the Chinese army has advanced to the area between Xiangyang, Xinye, Tanghe, and Tongbai. Fresh troops have been added to cooperate with the southern route forces. At the same time, the southern route forces are intercepting the Japanese army on the Han-Yi Highway, forcing them to Zhenxiang, forming a semi-circular formation to block the Japanese army's advance. Furthermore, the Japanese army's rear lines have also been intercepted. The Japanese army's plan to occupy Xiangyang on the Han River was forced to be abandoned. They can only gather their forces and attempt to attack Xiangyang, where the large Chinese army is stationed. According to Chinese military sources, the Chinese army's ability to quickly withdraw without being surrounded by the Japanese army proves the new mechanized units of the Chinese army in the second phase of the war. It is also said that news from the front line is delayed, so the number of losses on both sides in recent days has not been confirmed, but it is believed to be very significant.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 20th] According to Chinese war reports, after two days of bloody battles, the Chinese army has recaptured Zao Yang, and over ten × Japanese soldiers have been annihilated. Tianmen has also been recaptured. The Chinese army is attempting to cut off the Japanese army's communication between Jingmen and Yingcheng and is engaged in fierce battles near Yiheji. The weather has been extremely hot, around 100 degrees, which is not conducive to military operations due to the fear of epidemics. Therefore, both Chinese and Japanese forces are vying for strongholds, it is said. This is believed to be a major battle before the Japanese army advances on Changsha. The Japanese army has now abandoned its full-line advance and is implementing breakthroughs with large units, resulting in repeated strong guerrilla attacks on their flanks, and their rear transportation lines are in imminent danger.

### Fierce Guerrilla Warfare in Lu and Ji

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 20th] 1. Our army in Shandong Province has achieved a great victory in recent days, killing hundreds of × Japanese soldiers and capturing a large number of weapons. 2. After Commander Chiba was killed by our forces, the two commanders, Yimaru Oka and Hirata, engaged in fierce battles with our teams in Feicheng and Pingyin on the 11th. Maruoka was killed in battle, and Hirata was seriously injured. 3. All × Japanese soldiers in Shanghe were annihilated by our forces on the 12th night, and the county seat was recaptured. 4. Our plainclothes team attacked the Jinan Commercial Port on the 1st, killing more than 20 × Japanese soldiers in the puppet Preparatory Bank. At dawn on the 3rd, they attacked Guanzhaying, stormed into the × Japanese camp, and all 30+ × Japanese soldiers were killed. 5. Commander Shoushima, who was defending Qingyun, asked our forces through the Hui Father to not attack again. 6. Huang Zhentai's unit of more than 1,000 puppet troops in Cangzhou defected to our side, and we rewarded them with 6,000 yuan.

### All-Out Attack in Northern Jiangxi

[Central News Agency, Dongxiang, 19th] The war on the west bank of the Fu River is quiet, but in the Wuyang area, the × Japanese cannons occasionally fire at us, making a show of force to prevent our advance. The × Japanese forces have increased in Xiangtang, Shabu, Tanxincun, and other places, and they are building defensive works.

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 19th] The war situation in northern Jiangxi has improved since we launched a full-scale attack against the × Japanese forces from the latter part of last month. Apart from the recent left-wing aspects, we successively captured Gao'an, Gao You City, Xiangfu Temple, Fenghuang Mountain, Yajiuling, and surrounded Fengxin City three times, and once occupied Zhanggongdu. Among them, the battles near Gao'an and Fenghuang Mountain (about 5 kilometers south of Fengxin) were the most intense. The × Japanese casualties were over 3,000, including the deaths of three high-ranking × Japanese officers, including Suzuki Takashi, the commander of the 2nd Battalion of the Independent Mountain Artillery 2nd Regiment. Five were captured alive, and eight × Japanese field guns, more than 200 cans of unused poison gas, and more than 30 boxes of other documents and military supplies, as well as countless grain supplies, were seized. On the right wing, our attacking troops entered Nanchang City twice and engaged in fierce battles with the × Japanese forces inside and outside Nanchang City. The × Japanese casualties were more than 3,500. Later, the × Japanese forces urgently increased reinforcements. We retreated from the suburbs after achieving our goal of annihilating the × Japanese forces. As for the units that crossed the Jin River from the front, they successively captured Dacheng, Wanshou Palace, Shengmi Street, and once reached Niuxing and Lehua Railway Station, disrupting the × Japanese rear transportation and communication, also achieving results. In summary, the total number of casualties of the × Japanese forces in this attack in northern Jiangxi should exceed 10,000. Moreover, the quality of their soldiers is declining, and the atmosphere of war-weariness and anti-war sentiment is increasing. In the mouths of the captured × Japanese soldiers, there is no shortage of phrases such as "I only received two months of military training and was conscripted to the front line in China. How can I fight this battle?" and "When I was on guard on the front line in southern China, looking up at the sky, I thought of home, and my head drooped down." As for our army, this reporter once saw a certain unit crossing the Jin River to the front line three times, and saw that our army was in an active position, with both manpower and firepower capable of being used flexibly, encircling and annihilating the × Japanese army everywhere. Therefore, the morale is as strong as it has ever been. In addition, the relationship between the military and the people is also more harmonious than before. Wounded soldier rest stations and tea and water supply stations have been widely established along the way. The subsequent transportation of wounded and sick officers and soldiers, and the forward supply of ammunition and food, are all regulated by post stations, with transportation teams and ancestral frames organized by various counties to transport them back and forth in an orderly manner. However, the most difficult thing for the front line now is the lack of medicines and medical supplies. Because the troops have been fighting on the front line for a long time, they are prone to illness. It is hoped that all sectors will rise up to donate and provide practical and effective assistance.

### Continuous Cannon Fire at Tongguan

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 19th] The × Japanese forces at Fenglingdu have been continuously shelling the Tongguan military since the 18th, firing more than ten shells every four or five minutes. A × Japanese plane circled in the air to indicate targets. Our artillery responded with counterattacks, and many shells landed in the × Japanese positions. By noon on the 19th, seven × Japanese planes flew over our territory and bombed, but we suffered no losses. It is reported that the × Japanese forces on the north bank are also firing continuously.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 20th] On the 19th noon, more than 700 × Japanese soldiers from Jiaozuo, along with more than 40 cavalrymen, arrived in Qinyang, led by the × Japanese commander Dongze, and advanced towards our defending troops in Wanzhuang (20 miles west of Boai). × Japanese planes also flew in to assist in the battle. Our army calmly responded, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. In addition, more than 200 × Japanese soldiers once infiltrated Xinghe District, but were met with a head-on attack by our defending troops. After three hours of fierce fighting, the × Japanese soldiers were unable to withstand the attack and retreated to Xingtai.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 18th] A certain army of ours entered the Wang Detachment in Suidong. Recently, they have successively carried out large-scale destruction of the railway north of Fengzhen, as well as the bridges and power lines on the motor road between Fengzhen and Guisui Zhuozishan. The × Japanese forces are unable to travel. The Wang Detachment has captured many villages and towns in Suidong. The local people, oppressed by the × Japanese and exploited by traitors, felt like they had seen the light of day again when they suddenly saw the National Army arrive. They are all willing to serve as vanguards and serve the country. The detachment is now both appeasing the people and actively continuing to destroy without end. Father Leimingyuan

### Father Leimingyuan Pays Respects to Chairman Chiang

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 19th] Leimingyuan, head of the North China War Zone Service Corps, arrived in Shaanxi from the front line on the 18th and immediately went to Chongqing to pay respects to Chairman Chiang, report on everything, and make requests.

### The British Side's Firm Attitude on the Shanghai International Settlement Issue; The Settlement's Administrative Agency Refuses to Change

[Reuters, London, 20th] According to official information received here, the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, expressed support for the American viewpoint when discussing the Shanghai International Settlement issue with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, namely that it is not appropriate to discuss changing the administration of the Shanghai International Settlement at this time. Ambassador Craigie went on to express the British opinion on the Japanese proposal of May 3 regarding the reorganization of the Shanghai Settlement and, while supporting the American viewpoint, stated that this issue must be jointly discussed by other relevant countries, including China.

### × Japanese Forces Conduct Anti-British Propaganda in the Hongkou Area; Hongkou Police Did Not Intervene

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] Shanghai dispatch: On the 17th, an anti-British propaganda movement was held in the Hongkou area under the instigation of × Japanese people. On that day, four trucks slowly drove along various roads. The first truck was a military band playing marches. The next two trucks carried Chinese children of pre-school age, carrying a large number of anti-British leaflets, which they distributed along the way. The last truck carried a team of × Japanese soldiers. The leaflets incited Chinese people to be anti-British and discouraged Chinese people from depositing money in British banks. The Hongkou police did not intervene in this matter, only picking up the leaflets and sending them to the Central Police Station.

### Shanghai British Authorities Compile a List of British Nationals; Prepare to Conscript When Necessary

[Reuters, Shanghai, 20th] The British authorities here recently issued a notice stating that a list of male and female residents of British nationality has now been compiled, so that they can be requisitioned in the event of an emergency. Those concerned about this matter can inquire at the Consulate General for details. This notice is due to the amendment to the Conscription Act announced by the British House of Commons on the 17th of this month, which stipulates that British people abroad must also undergo military training.

### British Newspaper Comments on the Gulangyu Incident

[Central News Agency, London, 19th] The Manchester Guardian recently commented on the Gulangyu case. This matter can be compared to a scene in Shakespeare's famous play "Hamlet." In itself, it is not important and has a humorous flavor, using the small to imply the big, seeing the microcosm to know the whole picture. What the Japanese army is performing is to test the reaction of Western countries before taking action in Shanghai. However, the result has been clarified. Britain, the United States, and France have all sent warships to Gulangyu, and the US government has gone a step further and submitted a memorandum to the Japanese government, refusing to consider revising the Shanghai International Settlement Yangjingbang Land Charter. The wording of the memorandum is straightforward and penetrating, and it is a rare masterpiece of diplomatic documents. After the Japanese were flattered by the US President's special dispatch of a cruiser to transport the ashes of the late Japanese Ambassador to the United States back to Japan, considering it as a special favor from the United States to Japan, they should now know that this is not the case when they read this memorandum. More generally speaking, since the United States has cooperated with the relevant countries on the Gulangyu incident to protect its interests, it will probably adopt the same attitude towards Shanghai and other places in the Far East. Among the British, it is believed that if Britain signs a military alliance treaty with the Soviet Union, it may be enough to prompt Japan to change its policy.

### The People of Shaanxi and Hunan Are Eager to Kill × Japanese; Able-Bodied Men Voluntarily Enlist; Rural Women Send Their Sons to Join the Army

[Central News Agency, Tonghe, 18th] Yang Deshu, the Bao chief of Langjiang Township in this county, and others voluntarily enlisted to kill × Japanese. The township specially convened a grand farewell meeting, and the able-bodied men made generous speeches, vowing to complete the mission of resisting the war and building the country under the leadership's guidance. The voices and emotions were tragic and unprecedented. The able-bodied men were then transferred to the camp. The Bao chiefs of the township are loyal, brave, and patriotic. The township chief, Li Shiquan, has provided excellent guidance and is worthy of praise.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 19th] Gan Tai, a rural woman from Mian County, and Wang Ming and Lin Lucong, farmers from Lintong County, hate the invasion of the brutal × Japanese and have all sent their beloved sons to serve as soldiers. The authorities believe that these people have a deep understanding of righteousness and have issued a special order to commend them and presented them with a plaque.

### × Japanese Planes Bomb Mawei

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 19th] × Japanese planes dropped eight bombs on Mawei again yesterday. In the afternoon, they entered the air over Fuzhou City three times, flying low to spy.

### The × Japanese Forces in Guangzhou Arrest Able-Bodied Men in Large Numbers; Forced to Build Defensive Works

[Central News Agency, a certain place, 20th] The situation in Guangzhou has become tense. The × Japanese forces are arresting pedestrians in the streets in large numbers and forcibly conscripting thousands of able-bodied men, who are being taken to the suburbs to build fortifications and erect power lines.

### The Japanese Five-Minister Conference Concluded Yesterday Morning; Prime Minister Hiranuma Was Received in Audience to Report; The Content Is Rumored to Be Related to the European Situation

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Five-Minister Conference concluded at 11:40 this morning. Afterwards, Prime Minister Hiranuma immediately entered the palace to report the cabinet's decisions to the Japanese Emperor. After Hiranuma reported the content of this morning's meeting to other cabinet members who did not attend the meeting, he will issue a statement, it is said.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 20th] The Japanese cabinet held a special meeting this morning on a "final decision" regarding Japan's policy toward Europe. However, this decision has not yet been publicly announced.

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] At the cabinet meeting on Saturday and Sunday, the attitude that Japan should take in dealing with the European situation, which has been discussed for several weeks, was finally decided. However, political figures have no way of knowing the content of the resolution. It is reported that Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Itagaki, and Navy Minister Yonai gave speeches at the meeting, examining the European political situation in detail. After the meeting, Prime Minister Hiranuma reported the situation of the meeting to the Japanese Emperor and distributed reports to all cabinet members who did not attend. It is said that Foreign Minister Arita will report on the international situation to the Privy Council on Wednesday and announce Japan's attitude towards various issues. [Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] Tokyo dispatch: Although officials refused to disclose the contents after the Five-Minister Conference ended on the 2nd, it is rumored that the content is unrelated to the German-Italian military alliance. Japan's position is to adopt a neutral attitude towards the European situation, express sympathy for the Axis powers, and provide moral assistance, it is said.

### Declaration of the Production Conference (4)

Capital - Absorbing Floating Capital

Agriculture, forestry, industry, mining, and transportation are the main points of national economic construction in the future. Despite our ignorance, we have presented them one by one. There are still several matters that, although not the production business itself, are essential for the development of production, and we respectfully inform the people of the country about them. The first is capital, trade, and finance. Our country is based on agriculture, and production capital is accumulated. On the day when we promote production, the need for capital is extremely great. In addition to developing national capital and utilizing industrial and commercial capital, we must absorb floating capital to collect small amounts into a large sum. The best way to absorb floating capital is to promote cooperative affairs, which can not only gather funds, but also invisibly educate farmers on production and marketing, and reduce the exploitation of farmers by merchants.

Trade Control

Production specialization must rely on commerce for circulation. The two not only complement each other, but their degree of development often progresses in proportion. In our country's commercial policy, due to the needs of the vast rural areas, small merchants should be given extra support, and government taxes should also be reduced as appropriate to show consideration and encouragement. In international trade, we not only advocate government management during wartime, but also hope that today's control policies will gradually become stricter to establish the foundation for government-run international trade after the war.

Financial Institutions

Financial circulation is the lifeblood of production enterprises and must adapt to the needs of the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors. As a result of more than ten years of government efforts, upper-level financial institutions have gradually become complete. However, local financial institutions still need to be continuously adjusted. Although they have been reformed through two local financial conferences, they have not yet reached a sound state. Since the War of Resistance, the government has insisted on avoiding inflation, and we cannot help but admire this cautious attitude. However, since production enterprises are expanding day by day in the future, the amount of legal tender must be adapted to the needs of production enterprises, which is also appropriate. We also hope to give full play to the effectiveness of banks to create a source of short-term funds, give full play to the effectiveness of trusts and savings to create a source of medium-term funds, and give full play to the effectiveness of life insurance to create a source of long-term funds. Modern production-developed countries all use banks, trusts, savings, and life insurance as methods to form and expand national funds and as protective charms to ensure the safety of national production enterprises.

Labor

Utilize Human Resources

The second is labor. To seek the development of production enterprises, we must use our country's innate strengths. Although our machinery and technology are far inferior to those of Europe and the United States, if we can make good use of the vast labor force of 450 million people and improve existing production methods, we may not be able to make up for the lack of machinery. We say this not to stick to old ways and forget the methods of industrial modernization, but because transportation is inconvenient, and machinery from abroad cannot be transported in large quantities. We cannot give up quenching our thirst because we are just looking at plums. Moreover, this production method, although not as convenient as mechanical production, also has its advantages, that is, it will not easily cause strong fluctuations in the industry like mechanical production, and there will be no danger of a large number of workers losing their jobs.

Relief for Unemployment

For two years, the industries in the war zones have been damaged, and most workers have fallen into the suffering of unemployment. At the same time, production enterprises in the rear feel extremely difficult due to the lack of skilled workers, resulting in infinite waste. The workers who have moved from the war zones to the rear are often not engaged in production or are engaged in unsuitable work due to a lack of adjustment, so they cannot use their talents to the fullest. This is a waste of national talents and an obstacle to production development. The members of this association believe that the government should pay special attention to the production enterprises in the war zones and guerrilla areas. At the same time, the investigation and adjustment of skilled workers in the rear and the method of recruiting skilled workers in the occupied areas should also be given special attention to avoid the utilization of × Japanese people.

Labor-Management Disputes

Labor-management disputes are a major problem in modern times. The proper resolution of this problem is not only related to the tranquility of social order, but also related to the cultivation of national productivity. Wage treatment should strive to be reasonable to create unity and cooperation between labor and management. Other things such as the establishment of employment agencies, the implementation of labor-management arbitration, and the equipment of worker health should all be done one by one to realize the ideals of the People's Livelihood Principle. In agriculture, we believe that the government should vigorously support self-cultivating small farmers so that they can live a prosperous life. We also believe that we should find ways to make tenant farmers gradually independent to realize the Party's ideal of "land to the tiller" and establish a solid foundation for the country.

Education

Technical Talents

The third is production education. Production education is the source of production talents, and it is imperative to cultivate people for a hundred years. European and American countries have made this the basis for developing production. It is said that before the European War, Germany's industry was advancing without bounds, and its post-war recovery was rapid, all because of its large number of skilled workers. If this were not the case, even with perfect equipment and huge capital, it would be consumed and wasted invisibly due to poor management. China's lack today is not only the lack of high-level specialized talents, but especially the lack of low-level skilled workers. The government authorities should carefully consider the types and quantities of skilled workers needed by the country and implement large-scale production education as a quick remedy. The teaching materials of existing schools at all levels must be re-edited so that the education of schools at all levels is closely linked to production enterprises, so that teaching is not in vain and talents can be used to achieve the goal of cooperation between construction and teaching. Moreover, due to the poverty of the general people and the limited financial resources of the government, in addition to regular school regulations, we should also pay attention to the establishment of cram schools, the promotion of agriculture, and the implementation of factory internships to provide the general people with the convenience of studying. Women's education must also be fully promoted according to this principle so that women across the country have the opportunity to receive production education. If China's two hundred million women can be taught according to their talents so that they can participate in modern production and share the responsibility of resisting the war and building the country with men, then their contribution to the country will be immeasurable.

Ordnance Talents

As for the training of ordnance technical talents, special talents are needed, and it is more difficult to implement. It should be the responsibility of the military organs to coordinate, but it should also be able to connect with the science and engineering courses of various universities and various production organs to prepare for the country's urgent needs. The President said: The foundation of our country's resistance is not in the shallow and narrow transportation areas along the river and coast, but in the vast and deep hinterland. The southwestern and northwestern provinces are especially the source of our resistance. Only the development of transportation and economy in the southwest and northwest can be a solid foundation for the long-term resistance and construction work.

Conclusion

This National Production Conference was held on the day when the soldiers on the front line were fighting bloody battles and making meritorious contributions to killing × Japanese soldiers, and under the threat of the brutal × Japanese planes' coercion and bombing. The members of this association are concerned about the seriousness of the national crisis and feel responsible for the country's safety. They have racked their brains and discussed day and night, hoping to contribute their meager strength to the development of transportation and economy in the southwest and northwest and to assist the Vice President's great strategy of governing the country and to comfort the government's earnest expectations. The realization of this great historical mission and the assumption of arduous responsibilities depend on the joint and consistent efforts of the people of the whole country. The members of this association will devote their efforts and respectfully follow the people of the country and work hard. It is hoped that the government and the people will devote their efforts and carefully strive for practicality in planning, economy in expenditure, and success in enterprises. Hard work and practical work will lead to success. The humiliation of the national situation has lasted for a hundred years. Adversity can revitalize the nation. The ancients have clear instructions. It is our responsibility to carry on the past and open up the future. The past two years of the War of Resistance have given us invaluable experience and lessons in the course of arduous struggle and have made us deeply confident that our descendants of the Yanhuang gods will surely be able to overcome great difficulties and stand on their own in today's world to promote the national glory of our old country with a new mission. The economic construction in the future will certainly prove the greatness of the Chinese nation's creative power, and we will be able to complete China's industrial revolution with our spare strength in the midst of the country's resistance against Japan, establish the foundation of the new China's production enterprises, and realize the central government's national policy of resisting Japan and building the country at the same time. We sincerely hope that the people of the country will encourage each other. At this conference, the Party and the Chairman of the National Government issued instructions amidst the urgency of military affairs. President of the Executive Yuan also personally presided over the meeting despite his fatigue and gave earnest instructions. The people of the country are grateful for the authorities' good intentions to follow the long-term plan and the deep heart of earnestly seeking governance. At the time of discussing and issuing a declaration, we respectfully express our support and gratitude. (End)

### Twenty Captives from the Guerrilla Zone

— Fan Shiqin

[Fancheng Dispatch] Four months ago, the guerrilla zone in the Dabie Mountains was, in everyone's mind, like a child who had lost its mother, and fallen into Xiangyang. But the truth is not so; it sent word that it had grown up in the thickets; it sent people to say that it had driven the [Japanese] out of its gates. Recently, afraid that we wouldn't believe it, it sent twenty Japanese "brothers" to testify.

When I asked a military police officer where those twenty Japanese "brothers" were being kept, he pointed to a group of people in coarse cloth uniforms doing exercises in the square and said, "Those are them!" I was very surprised, because I had just passed by them, and I thought they were some recruits being trained.

"Japanese 'brothers,' this time you came from the Dabie Mountains, traveling more than a thousand *li* to get here; you must be very tired."

"Not at all!" A Japanese "brother" with round eyes replied bluntly, "It's really unexpected that we came to a place where the Chinese people gave us cigarettes and towels, and even held meetings to welcome us and send us off. Today, now that we're here, the people have given us shoes and socks and invited us to take a bath. We are really grateful and ashamed!"

Reuters reporter Mr. Smith was with us. He said that the Chinese people are truly generous and peace-loving.

I asked them with compassion.

A short, sturdy Japanese "brother" replied to me, "I am a crew member on the Unyu transport ship. I was captured by the local guerrillas because I was sent to the shore in Anqing to loot."

One with dark [complexion], named Morikawa, replied to me, "I am a poor farmer, forced to fight. I dream of home every day."

Two Japanese "brothers" standing together said to me:

"The guerrillas in Hefei attacked the Hefei Airport. We were pilots and were captured by them."

"The life of the Japanese people is already impossible without war, let alone now."

"The anti-warlord sentiment among the Japanese people is rising day by day."

This is what they said to me in unison.

A intellectual named Kubota Masaru analyzed Japan, saying: "Farmers - exhausted; workers - exploited; intellectuals - using the name of the country; soldiers - radical young officers; political parties - tails of the military; administration - increasing taxes; diplomacy - weak since ancient times."

Another person, Sato Shutaro, wearing rubber boots, said: "When I left Japan last June, Japanese society was in a recession. I know that twelve of my friends were imprisoned for opposing the war. Not a single Japanese laborer or farmer wants war. I heard that Tokyo is now heavily guarded to prevent anti-war movements."

"How many soldiers has Japan actually sent out, and how many times has conscription been carried out?" I asked a crew member who served on a transport ship.

"Before last October," he replied, "nearly two million people had been sent out, and conscription had been carried out thirty times, but I don't know now."

We talked about why Japan wanted to invade China. One, named Banmu, said: "In the country, I heard that after the Xi'an Incident, the Chinese Kuomintang and the Communist Party united. Japan wanted to prevent 'redification' and at the same time prevent the expansion of British power in the Far East, so it launched this war."

"Do you understand the true meaning of this war now?" I asked in return.

"The Japanese warlords caused this great chaos in order to get promoted and get rich," he said with a smile.

They complained to me that they were not acclimatized to the climate and soil when they came to China to fight, and nine out of ten people got sick. Fighting in the mountains, they couldn't find their way and couldn't find food. In winter, four people shared one quilt. They spoke as frankly as children.

"Do you know what stage the war has reached now?"

"Although we don't know what stage the war has reached now," one Japanese "brother" replied, "we have come here to guarantee China's victory."

### Soviet Ambassador Declares No Change in Viewpoint Rejects Latest British Proposal Again Halifax to France for Consultation

(Reuters, London, 20th) British Foreign Secretary Halifax, now en route to Geneva, will arrive in Paris today to meet with French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet to discuss British-Soviet negotiations. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky has also set out for Geneva to attend the League of Nations meeting to be held on Monday.

(Haitong News Agency, London, 10th) Yesterday the British government decided to change its policy and negotiate with Poland and Romania in an attempt to eliminate "various obstacles," as the Soviet Union may believe that assisting Poland and Romania only when requested would damage its reputation. According to political circles here, the focus of future negotiations will not be in Geneva, but in London, and the main figure will be Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky, as Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin cannot personally attend the League of Nations meeting. The first step in the new British policy is today's meeting between the British and French foreign ministers in Paris. Once the two sides have agreed on a plan, the British ambassador to Poland and the minister to Romania will contact the governments of their respective countries to explore their attitudes towards a British-Soviet agreement, and present the results for discussion at the British cabinet meeting next Wednesday to determine the next steps. Diplomatic circles here are currently very optimistic and expect that Britain and the Soviet Union can reach an agreement next week. It is reported that the British cabinet has decided to accept the Soviet conditions, and will also accept the French proposals for accompanying military conditions. According to news from the capital of Romania, Romania no longer rejects the Soviet guarantee, and Poland's attitude is no longer as rigid as before. According to news from Warsaw, Poland will not take any steps before Britain announces its readiness to enter into an alliance with the Soviet Union. However, the issue of whether Poland and Romania will also participate in the British, French, and Soviet alliance and enjoy the same rights remains unresolved and requires consideration. The only countries left are the three small Baltic states, but whether these issues will be raised for discussion in Geneva is still unknown.

[Associated Press, London, 19th] Before the British House of Commons met today, Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky visited the British Foreign Office again to deliver the Soviet Union's reply rejecting Britain's latest proposal. The Soviet reply insisted on the conclusion of a tripartite mutual assistance agreement.

[Reuters, London, 19th] Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited the British Foreign Office this morning and met with Foreign Office advisor Sir Vansittart. It is reported that the Soviet Ambassador informed Vansittart of the Soviet government's response to what they discussed on Wednesday. The details of the two men's talks this morning were recorded and submitted to Chamberlain for reference before Chamberlain's speech to the House. In the past day or two, the British government has not issued new instructions to its ambassador to the Soviet Union. According to Reuters, although Britain and the Soviet Union do not entirely agree on the method of anti-aggression, it is believed that it can be eliminated.

[Central News Agency, London, 19th] Soviet Ambassador Maisky left for Geneva via Paris at 10 p.m. tonight. Beforehand, British government diplomatic advisor Vansittart had asked to meet with him again at 7 p.m. (the two had already concluded a meeting in the morning), asking whether the Soviet government's proposal on the 15th of this month, "that is, the proposal that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union conclude a formal mutual assistance agreement," was definitive in nature. Ambassador Maisky immediately replied that the basic viewpoint of the Soviet government was to organize a collective security system, and that mutual assistance obligations were essential for success. This viewpoint would not be changed, and therefore, other suggestions besides a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union could not be accepted.

[Central News Agency, London, 19th] The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting this afternoon to discuss the progress of the current British-Soviet negotiations. The cabinet members present generally acknowledged that the conclusion of an agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union was a matter of urgency, and that Britain should make concessions. It is said among people close to the government that a British-Soviet agreement is expected to be reached, and that the Soviet Union's requests can be substantially satisfied. At the same time, Britain's freedom of action with its allies in the event of war in Eastern Europe will not be restricted in any way, and the power to decide on war and peace will not be left to the Soviet Union.

Sinclair Churchill Acknowledge Soviet's Important Position

[Associated Press, London, 19th] Liberal Party leader Sinclair criticized the government's rejection of the Soviet Union's proposal in a debate in the House of Commons today, saying, "I don't know if we can win in war without the Soviet Union, but I am certain that we cannot maintain peace without the Soviet Union." "The British proposal is not reciprocal. We must remember that Hitler is now closely watching the British-Soviet negotiations. If we want to gain the friendship of the Soviet Union and its military assistance, we must be on an equal footing with the Soviet Union, as equal partners, to jointly resist aggression."

[Reuters, London, 19th] Churchill, who participated in the House of Commons debate on foreign policy yesterday, stated that unless the Soviet Union is treated equally and can prove that the measures taken by the United Nations are effective, the Soviet Union will not be able to join any agreement. If leadership cannot be clearly defined, no one will be willing to join. The British government must recognize that without the backing of a vast and solid Soviet ally, no Eastern European country will be able to sustain a war for more than a year. Churchill continued, "We are not asking for help from the Soviet Union, but there are better proposals than those put forward by our government, which are clear and straightforward. We must not let past efforts be wasted. We sincerely hope that the government can understand the key points. If the government abandons this strong and factually necessary Soviet assistance, it will betray the people's confidence and tolerance in the government."

Eden Calls for Swift and Thorough Cooperation Between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union

Eden then expressed his opinion, stating that in his view, if Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can reach an understanding, it would be a blessing for peace. The sooner the understanding between the three countries is reached, the more substantial the content, and the more lasting the effect, the greater the benefits will be. He is convinced that this move will be beneficial to Britain, the Soviet Union, Europe, and the entire path to maintaining peace. Eden then discussed the issue from the perspective of British-Soviet relations, saying that he saw no reason why British-Soviet relations could not avoid conflict. Who in the world can devote themselves to domestic construction with all their strength? What is the government's current policy aiming for? It is not to seek a way to win the war, but to seek to avoid the occurrence of war. If this is the case, the stronger the organization, the greater its effect in preventing war. Therefore, for the sake of peace in Europe, it is necessary to quickly establish complete and thorough cooperation. Deputy Foreign Secretary Butler replied on behalf of the government: "I have heard people say that if an act of aggression occurs in the Mediterranean and the cooperation of the Soviet Union cannot be obtained, Turkey will not move a single soldier, but those who make this argument have misunderstood the true meaning of Turkey's declaration." Deputy Foreign Secretary then stated that the British government has no intention of considering recognizing Germany's annexation of Bohemia and Moravia. The British government has notified the Soviet Union that the British government believes that the British policy is more suitable for the current environment. Although it is not as clear as the Soviet proposal, it is believed that it will be able to provide effective assistance to places that need assistance. At the same time, the Soviet Union's [points] have been given careful and sympathetic consideration, and negotiations between the two sides are still in progress.

[Associated Press, London, 19th] Deputy Foreign Secretary Butler indirectly confirmed in a speech in the House of Commons today that there were obstacles in the British-Soviet negotiations. He said that the Soviet Union's recent proposal to Britain explained the advantages of the Soviet plan, but the British government replied that in the current environment, the British proposal was more [suitable]. Butler continued, "Our plan is simpler. When countries need assistance, we can provide it, and we can maintain harmonious cooperation between the countries concerned."

France Acknowledges That the Hope of Completing the British-Soviet Agreement Has Increased Greatly

[Reuters, Paris, 19th] Chamberlain's foreign policy speech has made political circles here feel that the hope of completing the British-Soviet agreement sooner has greatly increased. Although this question has repeatedly received divergent news from London and Moscow, it is unanimously believed that there is ample room for reconciliation where the views of the two countries differ, and France occupies an important position in this reconciliation.

[Reuters, Paris, 19th] Well-informed sources maintain an optimistic attitude towards the British-Soviet negotiations. It is said that the British side's new lectures were sent to Soviet Ambassador Maisky yesterday. Although the content failed to completely satisfy the Soviet Ambassador, it has made significant revisions to the Soviet viewpoint. The Soviet Union's reply in principle is expected to be sent to London tonight. It is generally hoped that after this revision, the agreement may be concluded; otherwise, British Foreign Secretary Halifax's talks here tomorrow may also help to conclude the agreement. French Prime Minister Daladier, Foreign Minister Bonnet, Secretary-General Léger, and Director of Political and Commercial Affairs of the Foreign Ministry Charvériat will all participate in this important negotiation. Halifax will be accompanied by British Ambassador Phipps and British Foreign Office British-Soviet relations expert Strang. French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with Soviet Ambassador Suritz this afternoon, and the Franco-Turkish agreement involving the security of the Mediterranean and the future of the Sanjak is also scheduled to be signed next week, or on May 22, the day Germany and Italy are preparing to sign an alliance. The French cabinet meeting tomorrow will make a decision on the Sanjak issue in principle. It is reported that Turkey has requested that the area be transferred to Turkey immediately. The Franco-Turkish agreement may promote the success of the British-Soviet negotiations, as Turkey believes that Soviet assistance is crucial in the event of war.

[Reuters, Berlin, 19th] A political commentator said today, "Chamberlain hopes to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union in the near future. If it is realized, then from Germany's observation, it will only increase the Soviet Union's arrogance, just as Britain's provision of guarantees to Poland has turned Poland hardened." According to political circles, strengthening guarantees to Poland, Romania, Greece, etc. will only increase Europe's unease. The political commentator stated that Chamberlain's talk about colonial issues stated that Germany's demands for colonies were not a matter of asking for concessions, but a due right based on President Wilson's Fourteen Points. What Germany seeks has not exceeded its original colonies, and there has never been any destruction of the Fourteen Points' crude oil behavior.

### British Labor Congress Decides to Participate in National Defense Work Rejects Proposal for General Strike Urges Britain and the Soviet Union to Conclude an Agreement

[Associated Press, London, 19th] A meeting of 1,000 labor leaders passed a [resolution] urging the government to immediately conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union to establish a "genuine peace front," and hoping that the United States could cooperate.

### Franco Delivers Radio Address Victory Parade Held in Rain Volunteer Troops Will Be Withdrawn Soon

[Associated Press, Madrid, 19th] General Franco delivered a radio address today, calling on the people to unite, saying, "If we do not seize a sound peace policy after our army's victory, then the acquisition of victory is empty and meaningless." Political circles here also declared that Franco will meet with several diplomatic corps on Saturday.

[Reuters, Madrid, 19th] A victory parade was held here today in the rain, led by the Italian army, lasting about an hour, followed by the Spanish army, carrying a portrait of General Franco. When Franco arrived at the distant inspection platform, cabinet members, diplomatic envoys, and military officers welcomed him. The streets were full of German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish national flags. Several aircraft flew low in the sky, forming the words "Franco." When the German Condor Legion appeared in the parade, radio stations reported on the legion's achievements in the Spanish Civil War, praising them greatly.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 19th] After the Spanish National Army triumphantly entered the city of Madrid today, five Italian transport ships are scheduled to depart from the port of Naples on the 20th and sail to the port of Cadiz in Spain to transport 18,000 Italian volunteer soldiers back to their country.

### League of Nations to Discuss Our Country's Application Fortification of the Åland Islands Also Included in the Discussion Procedure

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 19th] The 105th regular session of the League of Nations Administrative Council is scheduled to open on the 20th of this month. The agenda only contains two political issues, one being the application submitted by China. When discussing this issue, the Administrative Council can take the opportunity to comprehensively review the situation in the Far East. The other is the issue of the fortification of the Åland Islands. Regarding this matter, Finland and Sweden have established an agreement with the signatory countries to the 1921 international convention (i.e., Estonia, Latvia, Poland, Britain, France, and Italy), and now they will request the Administrative Council to approve it. In addition, other [issues] have not been included in the agenda. The Administrative Council's Three-Country Committee (composed of representatives from Britain, France, and Sweden) will also be submitted for discussion, which is also not certain. The change in the legal status of the city, in particular, is still firmly opposed by Poland. Generally speaking, representatives from Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will take advantage of the Administrative Council meeting to hold talks outside the venue, and its nature must be very important. However, because Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin is not here, Britain and the Soviet Union may not be able to make a decision.

[Reuters, London, 19th] Mussolini again inspected Italian defenses along the French border today, and Hitler also issued a communiqué from Eppingen tonight, describing his observations on inspecting western defenses for the past six days. Hitler claimed that he believed that the defenses there were absolutely solid. According to news from Berlin, the Germans were quite resentful that Hitler's inspection had not been fully publicized abroad. According to an explanation from a German newspaper, British policy is most afraid of discussing German national defense issues, which is why this happened.

### German-Lithuanian Trade Agreement to Be Signed in Berlin

### Procedures for Visiting the United States Have Been Drafted British King Arrives in Ottawa Delivers Speech at Parliament Accepts Credentials Presented by the American Envoy

[Associated Press, Washington, 19th] The State Department recently announced that the procedures for the British King and Queen's visit to the United States have been [finalized]. When someone asked whether the aunt of the Duchess of Windsor, Mrs. Bessie (Mrs. Manley Lehman), who is now in Washington, would be invited to participate in the welcome banquet, officials refused to answer this question.

[Reuters, Ottawa, 19th] It was announced here that when the British King's train arrives, the entire city will prepare a warm welcome. The streets are lined with a large number of neatly arranged army and air force personnel. It is reported that the British Queen accepted an ivory model last night at the Mount Royal banquet (engraved with a portrait of the princess) as a souvenir to take back from Mount Royal. When the royal car arrived, the British King stepped out of the car and reviewed the guard of honor. 6,000 people cheered enthusiastically. Lord Tweedsmuir and his wife were at the station to greet him, and a 21-gun salute was fired at the same time to pay tribute. Then, they drove to the Government House to meet with members of the diplomatic corps. When the British King arrived, it was raining heavily, and the people stood in the streets for two hours in the rain. Afterwards, the weather cleared up. The road from the station to the Government House was full of flags, dazzlingly beautiful. Thousands of young people stood by the roadside, waving British flags. The British Queen wore a light purple dress and a gray hat with ostrich feathers. The British King wore the uniform of a Field Marshal. The British King and Queen visited the Canadian Parliament this afternoon, and met with reporters in the Government House in the evening. The British King signed several bills in Parliament and delivered a speech to both houses, saying, "The late King said during the Silver Jubilee that the unity of the British Empire does not lie in the British Council possessing supreme power, but in the free union of the various nations within the Empire, accepting common political principles, common ideals of peace and freedom, united and loyal to the royal family. I deeply hope that this visit to Canada can promote greater unity among the Canadian people. I also hope that the visit to the United States can enhance the friendly relations between Britain and the United States. My visit abroad is enough to show that the spirit of our nation lies in friendship with all nations, whether they are of the same race or different races. Britain is willing to maintain friendly and harmonious relations with them." The British King also accepted the credentials presented by the new American envoy to Canada, Robert, at the Government House.

[Reuters, Ottawa, 20th] The British King and Queen met with about 80 reporters and several Ottawa parliamentary reporters at the Government House last night. The British King is officially spending his birthday in the territory of the Dominion for the first time, which is a historical first. All parts of Canada have declared today as a holiday. Special celebration programs include a review of the Canadian Guard and a celebratory banquet held at the Government House. The British Queen will preside over the groundbreaking ceremony of the Ottawa High Court today. Afterwards, the British King and Queen will cross the river to visit Hull and dine with Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King, who will host a banquet for the British King and Queen at the Chateau Laurier Hotel tonight.

### Regarding Talent Registration

Local newspapers have been running an eye-catching advertisement for the past few days:

Chinese Talent Registration Begins!

Chinese, Register Quickly!

Defend the Land and Defend Yourself!

Today’s newspapers also carry a news item that says:

Relief for Unemployed Mechanics in Guangzhou!

Central Government Sends Personnel to Hong Kong to Investigate and Consider Employment!

Over Three Hundred Mechanics in Hong Kong Participate in Talent Registration!

Seeing this advertisement and news item, I feel that there are many things I should discuss with my readers: After the British talent registration, the Hong Kong government continued to organize automatic registration of Chinese talent entirely because of the severity of the current situation, urgently needing to mobilize talent to defend the local area. Its intention is extremely pure and appropriate. Many of our compatriots residing in Hong Kong have participated in the First World War and contributed significantly to the Allied countries. Although that war should not have been participated in, the heroism and righteousness of the Chinese people were admired by the world. The crisis of another major war is now imminent, and we must solemnly recognize the meaning of future wars, resolutely oppose fascist aggressors to maintain peace and justice. Friendly nation Britain has recently been working hard in the anti-aggression movement. We should give enthusiastic support to this appeal from the Hong Kong government, promote the great spirit of overseas Chinese in the past, and prepare to fight for the protection of the local area, the protection of peace, and the progress of human culture. What we should pay attention to at the same time is that the promotion and treatment after talent registration should be completely equal to that of the British.

Secondly, regarding the central government sending personnel to Hong Kong to investigate unemployed mechanics, we feel that we should pay even more attention. First, because our country's war of resistance has entered a new and critical stage, we need talent everywhere to work together to overcome difficulties and strive for victory, and what is expected of overseas compatriots is particularly urgent. Second, since the war of resistance, not to mention the sacrifices of various talents in the country, those who have been displaced to various places and even overseas are in urgent need of relief. It is truly a great thing that the central government can pay attention to this at present, and our various overseas Chinese communities should strongly support and assist its implementation. However, at the same time, we should also pay attention to the fact that the talents needed by the motherland at present are extremely extensive, not only urgently needing technical talents who can contribute to production and construction undertakings, but also urgently needing specialized talents in military affairs, politics, culture, and diplomacy; and among the compatriots currently stranded overseas, there is no shortage of such talents. Therefore, we hope to quickly organize a talent registration with a broader scope and more detailed plans, and after appropriate testing, organization, and training, separately promote them to work in various departments. This matter cannot rely solely on the central government, and we hope that overseas Chinese groups and enthusiastic social leaders from all walks of life will come forward to cooperate.

The times are critical and the situation is pressing. May our compatriots from all walks of life encourage each other!

### China Salvation Drama Troupe Receives Guests from All Walks of Life Yesterday to Report on Overseas Propaganda Mission; Enhancing the National Salvation Sentiment of Overseas Compatriots; Using the Reality of the War of Resistance as International Propaganda

In order to enhance the national salvation sentiment of overseas compatriots and expand the international aid-China movement, the China Salvation Drama Troupe will soon go abroad to promote in the Nanyang, Philippines, and American areas. Passing through Hong Kong, at the request of the Hong Kong Federation of Relief Associations, they will make a short stay to hold charity performances to raise funds for the relief of wounded soldiers and refugees, which will be held at the Lee Theatre on the 25th of this month. In order to enable people from all walks of life in Hong Kong to understand the mission and significance of this overseas trip, the troupe specially held a tea party at the Astor Hotel on the second floor yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, inviting celebrities from all walks of life in Hong Kong and comrades from the cultural and drama circles to report on the overseas propaganda mission. Invitations were sent to various groups and celebrities to participate. Although the weather was unfavorable that day, with heavy rain pouring down, the attendees were very enthusiastic. It is estimated that there were over two hundred people, including Song Dazhang, representing Central Committee member Wu Tiecheng, as well as Zhang Zhaotang, Chen Binhe, Ouyang Yuqian, Li Jianfeng, Lu Guomian, Liu Qingxuan, Mrs. Chen Youxuan, Chen Tieyi, Li Meng, representatives from major social organizations, editors from various newspapers, reporters from various news agencies, and principals from various schools, gathering together, creating a grand occasion. The atmosphere was exceptionally lively and harmonious. First, Jin Shan, the head of the troupe, delivered a speech, reporting on the troupe's past work and the purpose and mission of this overseas propaganda trip. Jin first stated that the national cultural circles mobilized after July 7th and August 13th, organized the Drama Circle National Salvation Association, and formed fifteen national salvation performance troupes, which went to various war zones to carry out propaganda work. This troupe was the second troupe, which left Shanghai in August the year before last and went to Suzhou, Nanjing, Anhui, Hebei, Hunan, Guangxi and other places to do various national salvation work for a period of twenty months. Recently, in order to expand propaganda, there was the motivation to go overseas for propaganda. He continued to state that the purpose of this overseas trip was because overseas compatriots are far away from the motherland and it is not easy to understand the real situation of the motherland's war of resistance. Therefore, this overseas trip is on the one hand to fulfill their own responsibilities, and on the other hand to convey to the overseas compatriots the various atrocities that the troupe has seen in the past twenty months, and how bravely the soldiers on the front lines are fighting to defend the country, and how the people in the rear are shouldering their responsibilities during the war of resistance. In addition to expressing it through drama, they will also use various methods to promote to the overseas compatriots, so that the overseas compatriots have a deep understanding of the situation of the motherland's war of resistance, so as to give more help to the country. Jin finally stated that the troupe will first go to Nanyang, the Philippines, Singapore, and other areas, and then to Honolulu, San Francisco, and other areas. At the same time, they will also promote the war of resistance photos and war trophies to the international community. Finally, Song Dazhang, representative of Wu Tiecheng, Li Jian of the Press Association, Zhang Zhaotang, President of Guangxi Bank, Ouyang Yuqian, a pioneer in drama, Chen Tieyi of the Education Federation, General Chen Xiangyuan, and Lu Guomian of Zhong Sheng Charity Society, delivered speeches, giving much praise and encouragement. The meeting ended happily at 6:00 PM. (Please refer to today's newspaper's film and drama weekly feature)

### Attention, South China Film Industry! Strictly Guard Against XX's Silver Conspiracy; XX Actively Running Around in South China After Failure in Shanghai; A Certain Theater and Film Company Are Even Considering Willingly Being Bought Out

(Special Report from This Newspaper) Good films are the vanguard of culture, while bad films are the vanguard of destroying culture. Mr. Jiang Baili has a few famous sayings in military affairs: "If living conditions are compatible with fighting conditions, then victory; if they are separate, then defeat; if they are opposite, then death." Since the War of Resistance, it is not difficult to estimate how much work in the South China film industry has been coordinated with the War of Resistance, how much work has been separated from the War of Resistance, and even opposed to the War of Resistance. And XX's plot against us is meticulous, never letting up. Their attack on the Shanghai film industry has already revealed some behind-the-scenes activities. Recently, they have been actively running around in South China, trying to attack from this weakness. It is said that a certain theater is likely to be bought out, and a folk tale film produced by a certain company is also trying to supply the occupied areas in large quantities. If our work is separated from the conditions of the War of Resistance or opposed to it, it may not be impossible to remedy. If our work is even coordinated with XX's aggressive steps, then the crime will be unforgivable, and the serious consequences will be unpredictable. I hope the South China film industry will strictly guard against XX's conspiracy, and not be tempted by profit, earning bloody money by selling out national interests, causing pain to the present and joy to the enemy—for the sake of the war of resistance supported by the sacrifice of the heads of millions of compatriots, the displacement of millions of people, and the efforts of millions of people running around calling for help, and for the sake of the freedom of your own descendants for generations to come, we must loudly cry out! "Merchants, take back your greedy hands!"

### Fellow Townsmen from Guangdong and Guangxi in Shanghai Donate 10,000 Yuan for Disaster Relief in Guangxi; Remitted Through Guangxi Bank

Mr. Zhang immediately accepted and forwarded them. It can be seen that the overseas Chinese community in Canada is donating large sums of money back to the country, which shows the patriotic enthusiasm of the local people. In addition, the Hong Kong office of the Guangdong and Guangxi Fellow Townsmen's Relief Committee for Refugees in Shanghai, in view of the urgent need for relief for refugees, donated 10,000 yuan to be used for the relief of refugees in Guangxi. It was also remitted free of charge by Mr. Zhang to Chairman Huang of the Guangxi Provincial Government for receipt and forwarding.

### Preparing to Cope with the Current Environment; Hong Kong Volunteer Force Expands; General Garsia Speaks, British Position Is Extremely Serious; Hong Kong Must Work Hard to Prepare, Hoping for Participation from All Sectors

The Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps held its annual dinner and shooting awards ceremony yesterday (the 19th).

Participants included Commander-in-Chief General Garsia, Volunteer Force Commander Law Si, Lo Man Kam, Duo Wei Lu, and Liao Yali. Approximately 360 military, political, business, and gentry figures attended. During the meeting, Volunteer Force Commander Law Si reported on the general situation of military affairs last year, stating briefly that under the guidance of the Governor of Hong Kong, and with the enthusiastic cooperation of the army, navy, and air force, the exercises in various camps achieved satisfactory and excellent results. Recently, in order to adapt to the environment, the military quota has been expanded, and it is hoped that all sectors of Hong Kong will make efforts to participate. As for the current headquarters and barracks being insufficient, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army has been keenly aware of the urgent needs of the military and has agreed to find a way to solve this problem. After the speech, Commander-in-Chief of the Army General Garsia delivered a speech on behalf of the guests, saying briefly that the environment in which the British Empire finds itself is extremely serious. The speaker believes that even the most optimistic among us cannot deny this. Regardless of the international situation, we should strive to prepare to cope with the advent of adverse situations. We must know that striving to prepare is our responsibility. In times of emergency, the responsibilities of the Volunteer Force are extremely important. Therefore, it is hoped that the people of Hong Kong can actively participate in the Volunteer Force service, so that the status of Hong Kong can be further strengthened. Landslide near Tai Po Road.

### Hong Kong's Rats!

— Waiting

Breeding Quantity, Even More Than People!

When working in the newspaper office, I worked at night, and I couldn’t rest until after 2:00 AM. At that time, everyone was in a warm bed, dreaming good dreams, and the earth was as silent as death; the rats took this opportunity to come out and move around, looking for their food. Under the walls and floors were simply their "dormitories," and sofas and some valuable furniture were just their "sports grounds." They marched out in formation, coming and going, running east and west. They couldn’t steal cooked food, but they could also fill their stomachs with raw fruits. If they entered your bedroom, because they couldn’t find food, they would become extremely fierce and scream incessantly. These harsh, strange noises would startle even the soundest sleepers. Sometimes they even used the power of the group to overturn vases and drink water, knocking down soap and eating it; if you sewed a new piece of clothing, and didn’t hang it properly in the kitchen, and they unfortunately discovered the starch residue left by the garment maker, in order to eat the starch, your clothes wouldn’t even wait until tomorrow, and would have several large holes. Rats are completely destructive to humans, so people also deeply hate rats, wishing they could eradicate them completely—but we who work at night, although we clearly see them running rampant, are simply too busy to fight them when our work is most intense.

Rats not only disturb our good dreams and destroy our objects, but also spread infectious diseases. "Plague" is an infectious disease that is brought to mankind thanks to them. The popular "Black Death" is also transmitted by fleas on the rats. Patients develop a fever, develop nuclei in their bodies, and after death, their bodies develop black spots. Doctors are often helpless in the face of this.

Although rats exist everywhere and are not a unique product of Hong Kong, Hong Kong rats seem to be particularly numerous. Originally, rats have a very high reproductive capacity. Small rats can produce offspring after 100 days, and there are four litters a year, with five to ten offspring per litter. Calculating this way, the numbers are staggering; probably because Hong Kong's rat extermination work is not sufficient, they can continue to produce and reproduce. According to the statistics of the Cleaning Bureau, in the eight years from 1930 to 1938, a total of 1.5 million rats were killed in Hong Kong and Kowloon, an average of about 200,000 per year. Is this a good result for rat extermination? But according to experts' estimates, each pair of rats can produce 1,200 small rats in twelve months. Although Hong Kong's population has suddenly increased, it is believed that the number of rats is two to three times the number of people. This is how alarming it is! As for the property losses caused by the rats' "rampage" in Hong Kong, they have also been statistically analyzed. It is said that it reaches 2 million yuan every year, which is almost unbelievable.

The epidemics spread by rats in Hong Kong have also been very harmful. The great epidemic of 1894 was a gift from rats. It is heard that the epidemic first occurred in Yunnan, then spread to Hong Kong, and then from Hong Kong to India and various parts of the Far East. The mortality rate of this epidemic was 100,000 in Guangzhou, 5,000 in Hong Kong, and over 10 million in India. From 1930 to the present, plague has rarely been found in Hong Kong.

Although raising cats can catch rats, we also feel that dealing with cats is quite difficult; trapping rats with cages is actually difficult to succeed, and occasional success is just a fluke. In the United States, France, Russia, and England, there are "rat extermination companies." These companies specialize in catching and killing rats for people and eliminating disasters. Hong Kong does not yet have this kind of equipment, and to this day still mostly relies on cats to kill rats. Speaking of rat extermination, there is a joke in Hong Kong. It is said that once, the Hong Kong government, because rats were too rampant, promulgated a reward policy to kill rats. For every rat killed, the government would buy the corpse of the dead rat from him for five cents. This reward policy was indeed very effective. Every day, people taking dead rats to exchange for money was very enthusiastic, and the stream was endless. The results were quite remarkable. Later, it was discovered that many were transported from Guangzhou and Macau. Originally, they were using this reward policy to make money. Therefore, the Hong Kong government also stopped buying.

The most effective way to kill rats is to use poisonous rodenticides. The latest rodenticide is "Latin." The method is to inject "Latin" into bread, rice, wheat, wood, and cloth, and place it in places where rats must pass, allowing rats to steal and eat it. When the rats eat the poisoned food, the toxicity will take effect, and the rats' bodies will immediately become strong and hot, and they will die from it. It is a pity that no one in Hong Kong is using this method yet!

### On Ouyang Yuqian

— Hu Chunbing

Respectfully Saluting a Fighter Who Has Strived for Thirty Years in the Theater Movement

Not long after the centenary celebration for Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a venerable elder, theatrical figures in Hong Kong again gathered to celebrate Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's fiftieth birthday. To this theatrical giant, for his thirty years of effort in continuously adding new members to the history of Chinese spoken drama, we, the theater workers, should offer our boundless respect.

Here, we need to understand his life and thoughts. Only in this way can we understand the process of his work, understand the characteristics of his works, and discover the keynote of several periods of the Chinese theater movement through his career.

II

Mr. Ouyang Yuqian was born in the twenty-second year before the founding of the Republic of China (i.e., the fifteenth year of Guangxu, Ji Chou year). His hometown is Liuyang, Hunan. His grandfather was a famous scholar, and both Tan Sitong and Tang Caichang were his students. Yuqian went to Japan to study at the age of fifteen. He returned to China in the fifth year before the founding of the Republic of China (Bing Wu year) and married Ms. Liu Yunqiu. After the marriage, he went to Japan again, initially studying politics, then turning to literature and art. He returned to China in the Xinhai year. Regarding his theatrical life in Japan and after returning to China, Ouyang has described it in detail in his book "Since I Started Acting," in ten chapters: "The Opening in the Spring Willow Theater," "The Shenyou Society," "The Tongzhi Society," "The Social Education Group," "The Wen Society," "The Spring Willow Theater," "The Period of Being a Professional Actor," "Living in Nantong for Three Years," "The Experience of the National Theater," and "The Experience of the Guangdong Drama Research Institute." The harvest from his work in Nanjing from 1927 and in Guangdong after 1929 was extremely rich. At the end of 1930, he went to Shanghai to establish the "Great Era Society." After the January 28th Incident, he went abroad, staying in France and the Soviet Union for the longest time, visiting various theaters and troupes, and reading famous dramas from various countries extensively. He returned to China in 1933, went to Fujian for a period, and then went to Japan again. After returning to China, he served as a screenwriter and director at Xinhua Company, Star Company, and Lianhua Company. After the July 7th Incident, he participated in the Shanghai literary salvation movement, sparing no effort in forming acting troupes, organizing former war actors, and participating in the united front work. After that, he went to Guangxi via Hong Kong, where he directed for the National Defense Art Society and the 21 Drama Society. He arrived in Hong Kong in the summer of 1938 and has been there ever since.

Looking back on these thirty years of theatrical activity, we can conclude that he is forever a traitor to the old society or oppressors. His work has never stopped, nor has it ever remained at one stage. He is an artist with many talents. Last but certainly not least, he is constantly learning, constantly working, and constantly educating.

III

From the plays and films he has created, we can see how he grasps and absorbs the rapidly advancing Chinese culture, and how he participates in the creation. Below is a not-so-complete list:

Spoken Drama

A Shrew? (One-act play, 1924)

After Returning Home (One-act play, 1924)

The above two plays belong to the Shanghai Drama Cooperative era.

Pan Jinlian (Multi-act, 1927)

Young Girl Xiao Ying (Two-act play, 1929)

Business (One-act, 1929)

Xiao Lingzi (1936)

The Qingming Season (Co-written with Yao Weinong, 1936)

Such Splendor (1937)

Mulan Joins the Army (1938)

In these plays, there is no remarkable sermon, nor is there any startling plot. What he has are reasonable and realistic plots, reality anytime and anywhere, the development of images suitable for the masses, and seamless, sharply satirical dialogues. What is especially overflowing between the lines and beyond the words is a sense of resistance and justice.

IV

Mr. Yuqian received revolutionary baptism very early. When he was in Japan, the Tongmenghui was in its active period. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the strong oppression of the warlords also directly affected him. From 1927 to 1935, he constantly felt the disunity of domestic politics and the pain inflicted by the invaders. Therefore, fundamentally, he is a supporter of the united front with a correct worldview.

In terms of theater and film, since 1929, he has been advocating the slogan of "theater suitable for the times and for the people." In the unfolding of the anti-Japanese theater movement, he advocated that "theater should practice sinicization and popularization," advocated "improving artistic standards," and advocated that "theater workers should not be overwhelmed by passion and forget that theatrical art needs cultivation."

Naturally, these are suggestions and supplements to the theory and practice of the anti-Japanese theater movement, rather than a complete rejection of a certain theory.

V

Mr. Yuqian can be said to be a multi-talented artist, almost an all-around theater worker. He understands philosophy, understands politics, is good at poetry, understands music, and he can write scripts, direct, perform, and design stage settings. He knows English and Japanese, and also has some foundation in French and Soviet languages. Among the Chinese, he is indeed a rare giant.

He is mainly a good director, secondly a playwright, and then a theorist who doesn't like to speak out; he is not a very successful manager and organizer, and a very poor politician—he can't promote, can't flaunt, can't handle things quickly, and is too inflexible.

This is the reason for his achievements, but it is also the reason why his work cannot fully realize its effectiveness and be understood unanimously.

VI

What theater workers need to learn from Mr. Ouyang today is the spirit of continuous learning, continuous working, and continuous salvation that has lasted for decades. And his courage to resist and fight, "unmoved by wealth and unyielding to force," learn from his in-depth and simple popularization, the diverse ways of writing Chinese plays, and the service attitude of not competing for fame or gain.

At the same time, there are also many areas where young workers need to build new records with a spirit of blitzkrieg to supplement and expand the work of the elderly Mr. Ouyang, so that the anti-Japanese theater movement can achieve a higher degree of development, that is:

(1) Strengthen the belief that the war of resistance will surely be won and the nation will surely be built, so that the theater can truly mobilize the masses and accelerate the victory of national liberation;

(2) Establish a steel-like team of young theater cadres, collectively study and work, enrich and expand the united front of the national theater community;

(3) Carry out a script creation movement, to organically unify content and form, to be powerful and representative of the new China;

(4) Improve acting skills and stage technology standards; practice the expansion of the theater field;

(5) The organic and consistent development of work ability, work line, work method, and work attitude.

VII

Mr. Ouyang Yuqian is not old yet. He is full of youth and vitality in work and learning. This article is not a settlement but an introduction to greater action. We can predict—when Mr. Yuqian is as old as Mr. Ma Xiangbo, we will have a richer review!

Written on the day of Mr. Ouyang's fiftieth birthday

### Special Report on the China Salvation Troupe Reception

— Qi Zhuo

The China Salvation Troupe, which has been galloped through the northern and southern battlefields for twenty months and loved by millions of soldiers and civilians, has been in Hong Kong for more than a month. Time slipped away before the eyes of the workers, like lightning. In the past fifty days, inspired by the "perseverance" and "enthusiasm" of the China Salvation Troupe friends, a climax of "welcome," "reunion," speeches, "forums," and "flag presentation" has been set off everywhere like a torrent. The friends of the China Salvation Troupe, in order to sincerely thank the kindness of all walks of life and to exchange work opinions, held a grand gathering at the Sihao Hotel yesterday.

It had been raining all day, but the rain could not stop their meeting. It was also because of the rain that the sincere response was shown even more, forming a hot exchange. Leaders from all walks of life in Hong Kong and representatives from various social organizations and institutions ran in one after another, shaking their bodies, and the rainwater on their clothes splashed directly onto the floor. Raincoats and umbrellas slowly gathered together, men's wear, women's wear, gorgeous, simple, all kinds of styles, everything, a strange and interesting "rain gear exhibition." When meeting, the first thing to say was the trilogy of "waiting for the rain," "sheltering from the rain," and "braving the rain." The friends of the China Salvation Troupe were too busy to attend to everyone, repeatedly saying "Sorry! Sorry!" Groups of three or five were taught to cloth the huge auditorium, speaking freely.

When the pointer of time reached four o'clock, more than a hundred people sat down neatly in a horizontal row in the front and two vertical rows in the middle.

In a burst of warm applause, Mr. Jin Shan, the head of the "China Salvation Troupe," stood up. First, on behalf of the "China Salvation Troupe," he expressed his sincere gratitude to the guests who attended in the rain today. Then he talked about their work process in the war zone in the past twenty months. He said: "In the past 20 months, in the war zone, we have lived closely with the heroic soldiers and simple compatriots, and worked with a learning attitude. Now, I can say that we understand the motherland in the war. We recognize the motherland and deeply know that the future of the motherland is bright, and there is no precedent in history."

"However, the overseas Chinese who reside abroad, because of the special nature of the region, I believe that some overseas Chinese inevitably have a blurred understanding of the motherland, especially in the current stage of the anti-Japanese war after the fall of Wuhan, especially today when the × bandits and traitors are spreading rumors, sabotaging, and falsely accusing, the task of our delegation to go abroad is to promote these points to the overseas Chinese, so that they can further participate in the great cause of anti-Japanese war and national construction, so that the overseas Chinese can understand that the victorious motherland will change their difficult status overseas, and will not erase the merits of every citizen in the struggle of hardship and difficulty."

"At the same time, based on our work experience in the war zone, the medical, reception, and transportation problems of the wounded soldiers, the problem of cultural food in the war zone, and the livelihood problems of disabled soldiers, the families of soldiers who went on expeditions, and the families of fallen soldiers, make us feel that it is necessary to solve them as much as possible. Another task of our delegation to go abroad is to raise 500,000 donations to establish wounded soldier reception stations and wounded soldier hospitals. Since the war of resistance, the enthusiastic situation of overseas Chinese transporting materials and strength is known to every compatriot. The millions of donations they sent to the motherland are the cornerstone of national construction and the power of the anti-Japanese war. I believe that overseas Chinese who love the motherland will help us to complete this work."

"However, this task is too heavy, and we are too insufficient. Soon, we will have to pick up this major burden and leave Hong Kong. Before leaving this place, we earnestly hope that all gentlemen and friends will give us guidance in many ways. One valuable opinion from everyone can reduce our difficulties by ten points. In order to get more guidance, I don't want to drag my words too long, and at the same time avoid wasting too much of your valuable time."

Enthusiastic and sincere, Mr. Jin Shan is not only a serious salvation worker, but also an inspiring speaker. This is an excellent talent trained by the times. Everyone ate tea and snacks while listening to the speech:

The first guest speaker was Mr. Wu Tiecheng, member of the Central Committee, representing Mr. Song Dazhang, who praised the China Salvation Troupe. Li Jianfeng, representative of the Press Association, said that it is the glory of the cultural world for the China Salvation Troupe to serve the front line and comfort the overseas Chinese. It shows that our youth is not decadent or sluggish, and it is also the glory of the Chinese nation. Secondly, he said that he was entrusted by the Charity Federation of all walks of life to co-organize this charity performance of the China Salvation Troupe. For art and for meaning, it is worth everyone's enthusiastic appreciation.

Mr. Zhang Zhaotang said: Drama is the best tool for propaganda. In the past, dramas that performed Yue Fei were very popular, and those that performed Qin Hui were hated, scolded, and beaten by the audience, which shows the greatness of the power of drama. Today's drama is much more advanced than before, and the effect is even more profound.

Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, a pioneer in the theater world, said; When the China Salvation Troupe arrived in Hong Kong, all walks of life welcomed them warmly, and the mission to go overseas is very important, and it will surely be welcomed by the vast number of overseas Chinese. When the China Salvation Troupe was first established, Mr. Ouyang was also in Shanghai. He still remembers the situation when he sent them off at that time. We were deeply moved when we heard it. He said that now seeing Jin Shan is like seeing a long-lost friend, very excited and very happy. The work of the China Salvation Troupe is multi-faceted, and drama is only an important tool. Their progress is tempered from the front line, and this is also a new development in Chinese drama. The theater community in Zou City really feels very ashamed!

Now, the war of resistance is difficult, and it will be difficult to build the country in the future with scars all over. The task of the China Salvation Troupe is for the war of resistance and also for the construction of the country. We all have the same important task. To welcome the China Salvation Troupe, we must meet in work.

——This passage was particularly kind and meaningful when Mr. Ouyang said it, and a burst of warm applause was woven together.

After several other guests spoke, Mr. Lin Shu, the head of the Guangxi Student Army Regiment who went abroad with the China Salvation Troupe, reported on the experience of participating in the war of resistance on the front line, and the atmosphere in the whole venue became particularly tense. He said how to fight under the artillery and airplane bombs, and the strong morale, the great power of the youth and the masses, and the vivid heroic deeds made people feel very excited. Mr. Lin's last paragraph was especially moving: "Mr. Jin Shan said that I am helping the China Salvation Troupe to promote, which is very rare. In fact, it is very rare for me to learn from the young friends of the China Salvation Troupe. When Director Jin Shan was directing, he was full of sweat, which moved me very much. Now, I don't know how to act, but I also play a small role. I hope to perform better in the future for everyone to see." Warm applause was drawn a lot, and everyone laughed and sent off Mr. Lin first. to come.

Mr. Jin Shan gave the final conclusion: "We are the sentinels sent by everyone. We have experienced and understood that the war of resistance will surely be victorious. We ourselves feel that our cultivation is not enough, but there are two words that we can definitely do, that is "sincerity." We will never retreat even if we shed the last drop of blood. I hope you will give us sentinels orders and whips. We must repay your expectations with work. Now, on behalf of all the members of the China Salvation Troupe, I salute you. Goodbye"!

### The Significance of the Re-performance of "Huanghuagang"

— Ying Zhong

The emerging theater movement in China has shown its sharpness and fighting spirit even more because of the full-scale unfolding of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Theater workers in Hong Kong have also given full play to the propaganda effect of theatrical art according to the needs of the environment, leading the masses to participate in the ranks of the War of Resistance Against Japan.

"Huanghuagang," this great historical revolutionary drama, was performed under this meaning. This is a rare great action in the history of the Hong Kong theater movement. Its power and the magnitude of its response are unparalleled, especially in consolidating and developing the theater movement in Hong Kong, it has made a great contribution to the promotion task. Now, it is being re-performed under the auspices of the Hong Kong Charity Federation of all walks of life. This performance bears two major roles: in addition to raising money to comfort the families of the soldiers who died on the front line, just like the first performance, it is also to celebrate the fiftieth birthday of Mr. Ouyang Yuqi, the most advanced mentor of our theater workers.

Mr. Ouyang Yuqian has made many contributions to the emerging theater movement in China. He opened up a way to improve the old opera, and he led the emerging theater movement. From decades ago to the present, he has always stood firmly on the position of theater.

In the establishment period of the Chinese theater movement in the past ten years, because of the obstruction of the environment, I don't know how many theater workers left their positions and gave up this great work, but our Mr. Ouyang Yuqian is still fighting hard in the difficulties as he has been for decades!

In the current stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan, theater has certainly played a great role, but many theater workers have obliterated the in-depth work that theater should have in art, and only picked up its propaganda side. In fact, the essence of theatrical art will help its propaganda role. If this point is obliterated, it will inevitably flow into vulgarity. Naturally, we cannot ask every theater worker to take care of both sides at such a critical time, but this arduous work must be shouldered by someone, and Mr. Ouyang Yuqian is still leading us all the way to that road full of brilliance.

My theater workers, with the greatest enthusiasm, to bless Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's fiftieth birthday? It is a deep meaning and role with infinite importance.

### Wish Mr. Ouyang Always Young!

— Ling Ke

What kind of person is Mr. Ouyang Yuqian? Why is it worthy of our theater workers to celebrate? Naturally, I believe that our theater workers already know clearly—Mr. Ouyang Yuqian is the pioneer of our Chinese emerging theater—he spread this emerging theater art to the wilderness of the motherland thirty years ago. At the same time, in these thirty long years, he has experienced all kinds of hardships, appearing as a petrel in the storm, and unyieldingly cultivating and irrigating... He has never left his position, and has never given up the revolutionary task of the emerging theater tradition; it can be said that Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's theater work history is an important chapter in the history of the Chinese emerging theater movement, and the glorious record of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's theater work is also the main nourishment for the flowers opened by Chinese theater today; all this is enough for our theater workers to celebrate enthusiastically!

Besides being worthy of our enthusiastic celebration in principle. I think: Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's constant learning, constant work, standing in front of the great era at all times, and brave fighting, this spirit is the example for theater workers, and it is what we should learn and promote.

At the same time, today. The national self-defense war of resistance has reached a more serious stage, and some wavering elements who do not have firm faith in the country and the nation have successively appeared and defected from the motherland to the × bandits' camp, or left their positions and stopped fighting, and Mr. Ouyang answered us in action, he contributed all his strength to serve the war of resistance. "Pine and cypress are known in the cold winter," and "strong grass is known in the fierce wind." Now that the Chinese people are in this critical time, Mr. Moyang, who is fifty years old, is still as loyal as ever to save the nation from danger. It is by no means meaningless for us to celebrate the birthday of such a fighter.

Finally, I celebrate: Mr. Ouyang's working spirit will always be young!

### Introduction to "Paradise in a Lonely Island," the First Film by Da Di Film Company

— Qing Yun

Cai Chusheng's First New Work After Coming South

After the sudden outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan in the motherland entered a prolonged state, and after Shanghai and Hong Kong successively became isolated islands, the Shanghai film industry, which had been caught off guard and became rigid, was resurrected, while the Hong Kong film industry flourished in an abnormal and almost insane manner. This distorted phenomenon plunged the entire film industry into a state of turmoil. Fortunately, there were still a few workers who were neither threatened by power nor lured by profit, and who firmly defended their film posts in the harsh environment. As proven by their actual actions, we should say that our progressive director, Mr. Cai Chusheng, is one of those who stood their ground. We should not so much honor such responsible workers as brave fighters, but rather call them "hardworking soldiers."

In a time when some directors could produce thirty or forty films, he was still working on the script for "Storms in the South China Sea"—collecting, selecting, and processing his script materials. He was determined to—rather not realize it than realize it carelessly. And Da Di Film Company, which invited Mr. Cai Chusheng to direct this film, also holds the same goal.

Because they needed to wait for the right time to shoot "Storms in the South China Sea," several months ago, he decided to first shoot "Paradise in a Lonely Island," originally by Mr. Zhao Yingfang. After two or three months of hard work, he completed the screenplay and prepared everything. Thus, "Paradise in a Lonely Island" began its work on the set. In recent days, working through the night, through the night, through the night, it is being filmed under intense pressure. Everyone involved in the work is putting in all their effort.

Although this film is called "Paradise in a Lonely Island," it strips off the outer garment of paradise that "the isolated island" wears, and sees through the inner layer of the isolated island. From here, it dissects a group of characters who have been tested by "the War of Resistance"—this great touchstone, and from this group of characters, it sees a microcosm of the War of Resistance, expressing its absolute significance.

The characters it includes are: a northern dancer, a mysterious young man, a young lady from the mainland, a playboy from Shanghai, a bartender who gives injections to relieve pain, a young lady frightened by the artillery fire, gangster henchmen, a miserable woman, a group of children selling newspapers... The people who play these roles are Lili Li and Hong Hong, who came from afar, Li Qing, who would rather starve than make poisonous movies, Bai Lu, who has been away for a long time, Jiang Junchao, and the actors from the China Art Troupe, such as Tong Ru, Yang Wei, Ge Xin, Jiang Ming, Li Hua, Li Jingbo, Lan Ma, Zhang Lide... Audiences in various places have long had a very clear understanding of them on the screen and on the stage.

Because film is not only a comprehensive art, but also a comprehensive science and technology—sound, light, electricity, and chemistry are all sophisticated parts that make up a film, so the quality of the technology often determines the beauty or ugliness of the artistic value of a film. Although Da Di Company was established through pioneering in difficult and arduous conditions, it does not want to be careless in the slightest about this point. The reporter has visited a partial screening of "Paradise in a Lonely Island," and it can be said that there has been rapid progress in technology, comparable to imported films. Secondly, we see the technical equipment of Da Di Company and feel that they should get such excellent results. The camera they use is the latest "Beyer Good" machine specially designed for sound films with five lenses. The recorder is the only silent recorder designed and manufactured in China by Luo Jingyu. Other equipment such as dubbing, printing, lighting, and editing are only available in the South China film industry.

The technical department of Da Di Company is also personally responsible by Mr. Luo Jingyu, the head of the company. Mr. Luo has made many contributions to film technology after the War of Resistance, which does not need to be introduced much. As for the heavy responsibilities of the drama and affairs, they are presided over by Mr. Tan Youliu. In addition, the famous photographer Mr. Wu Wei serves as the photographer, and the experienced Mr. Ye Jian serves as the set designer. From this ideal team of workers, it can be determined that it will definitely become an ideal work.

Never being careless about works has always been one of the characteristics of Mr. Cai Chusheng's success. He will go to great lengths to express the parts that should be seen by the audience and that the audience needs to see, and he will never abuse film techniques to avoid difficulties. In the script, he has already thought about the details of the play very carefully and written it very detailed. Before the filming of each scene, he uses a watch to plan the position of each actor. This kind of work is also something that directors in southern China have never done. Only through arduous struggle can there be outstanding performance. After "Morning in the Metropolis," "Song of the Fishermen," "New Woman," "The Prodigal Lamb," and "Wang the Bachelor," what kind of "Paradise in a Lonely Island" will we be able to see? This is not difficult to predict.

Dramatic Movements

### Work Overview of the Editorial Committee for the History of Chinese Spoken Drama Movement The Ministry of Education Appoints Shu Chang as Editor-in-Chief The History of Drama is Currently Compiled Up to the Return of the Spring Willow Society

The "Editorial Committee for the History of Chinese Spoken Drama Movement," in order to widely collect historical materials on drama, sent a letter to this newspaper's editor, Lu Fu, and Nanhua College's secretary, Wang Yongzai, asking them to be responsible for collecting materials in Hong Kong. This news has been recorded in previous issues of this journal. Now, Lu and Wang have begun to plan the methods for collecting historical materials. In addition to consulting with various drama pioneers and the heads of various theater groups, they have also rushed to print two types of survey forms, one for groups and one for individuals, which can be sent out as soon as they are printed during the day.

Regarding the overview of the committee, many comrades have inquired. Now we will briefly report its general situation in advance to answer the concerned friends:

In January of this year, Yu Shangyuan, the principal of the National Academy of Drama, was ordered by the Ministry of Education to organize the "Editorial Committee for the History of Chinese Spoken Drama Movement," with Yu Shangyuan, Zhang Daofan, Wan Jiabao, Gu Yiqiao, Liang Baoqiu, Zhao Taiyou, Huang Zuolin, Yan Zhewu, Shu Chang (Weiqing), etc. as members, concurrently serving as the editor-in-chief, and formally engaged in the collection, compilation, and printing of historical materials on the Chinese spoken drama movement.

The editor-in-chief of the committee, Shu Chang, currently works at the National Academy of Drama. For more than 20 years, he has successively promoted the spoken drama movement in Ping, Tianjin, Yu, Zhe, Gan, Xiang, and E. He also specializes in the collection of dramatic books, publications, pictures, and historical materials on acting. He has compiled books such as "A Catalogue of Modern Dramatic Books."

According to a letter from Mr. Shu Chang: The history of the movement has now been compiled up to the return of the Spring Willow Society. The first stage is about to be completed, and he hopes that the pioneers of the drama world will send initial historical materials to enrich it. (Due to space constraints, the names of the various books requested will be published in the next issue.)

Hong Kong, which restricts food at 3:30 PM against Haiguang, the rain is the sweet dew for the residents. However, every Thursday at 4:30 PM, Da Zhong vs. Taikoo, and 5:30 PM and Sundays, are good days for football players to be active. Generally, pleasure-seeking fans, Spring Grass vs. Kang Yuan, judging by the strength of each team, no one wants to have their excitement spoiled by the rain on these two days. It would be a shame to miss the good times. For example, yesterday, the Bell Sound team coordinated well. Haiguang should not be the original two good orders in the football world, (1) is the South China vs. All-Star football charity match, the enemy, Taikoo is slightly stronger than Da Zhong, there is (2) is the Chinese vs. Friends Cup baseball league. If it were performed, it would definitely cause a sensation. Winning is possible. Spring Grass defends well, and can definitely defeat Kang Yuan. But today, heaven is not cooperating.

That football charity match, since it missed the good opportunity due to rain, it is feared that it cannot continue. Because the football players of the All-Star team are selected by several associations. Since yesterday's match was not successful, the General Association cannot immediately notify the football players to change the game to today. Moreover, the soldiers of the Army rarely play football on Sundays. Therefore, even if the General Association can immediately notify them separately, it may not be possible to form a team and compete with South China. Therefore, the person in charge of the General Association has notified South China yesterday that this charity match will not be held today. And South China is about to leave for a southern tour, and there is no suitable date to meet with the All-Star team. Let's wait until they return to Hong Kong before pleading for the refugees.

However, South China has agreed to a practice match with the sailors of the British warship HMS Gannet at Jia Shan at 5:15 PM today. If it clears up today, then this battle will definitely be carried out on time. It is said that there are many capable members in this team of sailors, and their strength is very strong. Therefore, South China has also compiled a perfect lineup to meet the challenge.

Zhang Jinhai, a football player from Shanghai, has been working very hard in every practice match since joining South China. The South China authorities attach great importance to him. Therefore, he has been specially transferred to play as the right midfielder today. Let's see how he performs after changing his style. Also, Liu Songsheng, who has been absent for many months due to a foot injury, has recently fully recovered. Today, he will wear his uniform again. The lineup is arranged as follows: (Tai Sui)

Zhang Rongcai

Li Tiansheng Liang Bowen

Tan Zhenhui Liu Qingcai Zhang Jinhai

Luo Douwen Ye Beihua Chen De Liu Songsheng Yang Shuiyi

Judging by the strength of each team, Bell Sound coordinates well, and Haiguang should not be their opponent. Taikoo is slightly stronger than Da Zhong, and has a chance of winning. Spring Grass defends well and should be able to defeat Kang Yuan. Also, admission is free today. Outside visitors are welcome.

### Davis Cup Tennis Tournament Chinese Doubles Also Fails France Wins in Three Straight Sets

[Reuters Paris, 20th] In the Davis Cup doubles match, France eliminated China in three straight sets. Today, French players Boussus and Pellizza defeated Chinese players Xu Chengji and Cai Huiquan with scores of 6-2, 6-0, and 6-3.

Xu and Cai were almost powerless against the fierce smashes of the French players Boussus and Pellizza.

Speaking of the Xu-Cai battle itself, they always maintained a very good counterattack and were able to hold the French players and win the points they could capture.

Also, Sweden and Denmark each won one singles match. In Germany vs. Poland, Germany won the first singles match, and the second singles match was postponed due to darkness and rescheduled.

### For Beginner Swimmers (1) Several Common Mistakes

— Zou Falu

Swimming is a full-body exercise and an essential life-saving skill. In the southern country, where it is suitable for all seasons, it is an especially supreme exercise. However, beginners often have mistakes that they do not realize themselves, and the result of this mistake can affect swimming technique to a small extent, and endanger life to a large extent. Now, I will list several common mistakes, hoping that beginners will pay attention to correcting them.

(1) Panic and Fear of Water Water has natural "buoyancy" and "pressure." Beginners, without understanding the nature of water, are affected by buoyancy after entering the water, and feel that their hands cannot move, their feet cannot take steps, and their bodies are swaying and falling. All movements are beyond their control. Affected by the pressure, the chest feels bound and breathing is not free. They are anxious and flustered, and in a precarious situation. There is no right place all over the body. Therefore, they doubt that water is something that cannot be conquered by human power, and they naturally develop a fear of water. They panic and act abnormally. All the dangers in the water are created from this. You must know that since water has "buoyancy," it can naturally help us float to the surface. As long as you are familiar with the nature of water, use a calm mind and appropriate methods to use this "buoyancy," you can naturally achieve all the requirements of swimming technique. There is absolutely no reason to be afraid of water.

(2) Raising the Head and Bending the Knees Beginners, because water will enter the lungs from the nostrils and mouth when breathing, in order to facilitate breathing and avoid danger, always raise their heads out of the water. Because the feet are subjected to the pressure of the water, it is not easy to lift them up when they are straightened. In order to facilitate movement, they all bend their knees when kicking water. However, whether an object can float in the water depends on its weight and the size of the area attached to the water surface. For objects of the same size and the same weight, if they are to float, the part attached to the water surface must be the largest. For example, a piece of wood, when it floats on the water, it must be horizontal, not vertical. This is a very simple example. Therefore, if a person is to float in the water, they must also try to maximize the part of the whole body that is on the water surface. If you raise your head and bend your knees, then the part of the whole body attached to the water surface will be reduced by the bending of the head and feet, and it will naturally feel difficult to float. The reason why beginners cannot float more than they want to is because of this.

### Yesterday's Baseball Game Was Stopped by Rain Two Games Will Be Held Today If the Weather Clears The Second Act South China vs. Mindi Nu Is Sure to Be Spectacular

### Current Students (4) The Necessary Reforms for Physical Training

— Zou Falu

Students are mostly singing an agreeable tune about this movement, doing whatever they please, regardless of what is called posture, whether it is correct or not, and even less willing to take it into account. The reasons for this are, firstly, because they are used to being casual and moving casually, which easily suits their casual intentions; secondly, because they are lazy by nature, and doing exercise according to the correct posture is bound to feel strenuous, hoping to save effort, so they are unwilling to do the correct posture. It must be known that without correct posture in exercise, it is impossible to obtain the benefits of exercise. For example: the effect of the twisting exercise in gymnastics is originally in the abdomen and waist. During practice, the feet should not move and rotate with the direction of the twisting movement, otherwise, the effect will only reach the feet, not the abdomen and waist. This directly affects the body; also, in sports such as track and field and ball games, not following the correct posture, although only affects the results on the surface, often reduces interest due to poor results, and unwillingness to continue efforts, and the result is still affecting health. This is casual exercise, which must be reformed into correct and arduous exercise.

In peacetime, for the sake of hobbies, they often do only one kind of exercise that they like. As a result, the effect is often biased towards a local part, forming a deformed development; they specialize in the development of muscles while ignoring the training of internal organs, resulting in a defect of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside. It must be known that any part of the body that cannot get normal development can affect health. We certainly cannot only do exercises for part A while ignoring exercises for part B; we also cannot ignore the direct exercise of part B because part B has an indirect opportunity for exercise when we exercise part A. Because indirect exercise is never as rapid as direct exercise. This is local exercise, which must be reformed into exercise that develops all parts of the body evenly.

Students who do not go to the sports field all day long and rarely have the opportunity to exercise throughout the year cannot get the benefits of physical training. Students who are in the sports field all day long, regardless of whether their physical strength is competent, just move and work hard, cannot get the benefits of physical training, either. The so-called "too much is as bad as too little" is true. However, I think that the disadvantages of too much are better than too little. Those who are too little can reach the appropriate level as long as they intensify their efforts. Those who are too much: lightly, they need a considerable period of rest to recover to their original state, and the previous hard work is all in vain; heavily, they need long-term treatment, or even harm their body, and there is no hope of recovery for life. This is too much or too little exercise, which must be reformed into exercise that is appropriate and moderate.

Exercising under the supervision of the teacher, exercising when there are many people and the atmosphere is lively, exercising when there is a good environment, exercising when the exercise suits the individual's wishes, and otherwise not exercising, is sporadic or intermittent exercise. No matter how much you move in a day, or how much you move at a time, the result is as useless as eating multiple times a day, skipping many days before eating again, eating a lot at a time, and then not eating next time, which does not provide nutrition to the body. This is intermittent exercise, which must be reformed into exercise that is persistent and persevering.

"Climbing high must start from the bottom." "Traveling far must start from the near." These are the best examples of doing things that must be done step by step. When practicing exercise, not only should we proceed step by step according to the individual's developmental order and physical condition; even in each practice, we should proceed step by step according to physiological needs. When starting exercise, the body has not reached a strong level, and we should first use gentle and universally developing exercises to lay a good foundation, and then gradually use exercises with greater momentum to improve health. At the beginning of each exercise, because the body temperature is low and the muscles have not been prepared, we should first use gentle exercises to warm up the body and activate the joints, and then gradually increase the momentum to achieve the purpose of exercise. Disregarding everything and doing the same formal ball game exercises is burying the health of the delivery. This is cross-level and indiscriminate exercise, which must be reformed into exercise that is step by step.

In short, in this extraordinary period, the country's extraordinary elements—students—should have extraordinary physiques to cope with extraordinary environments and complete the extraordinary cause of resisting the war and revealing the country. This is known to everyone. However, to have an extraordinary physique, we must have an extraordinary determination for physical training, correct all the previous incorrect understandings, and change the wrong paths to have the confidence of sure success.

### Shanghai Lacks Investment Opportunities; Changes in the Domestic Economic Situation (Continued): Excessive Optimism About the Abnormal Prosperity of the Shanghai Market Is Unwarranted; Development of the Southwest Economy Depends on Transportation Infrastructure; Annual Report of the Shanghai Bank

Trade

This year, our country's foreign trade has been severely affected by the war. Total import trade amounted to 86,199,000 yuan, a decrease of 67,186,000 yuan compared to the previous year. Total export trade amounted to 762,641,000 yuan, a decrease of 75,615,000 yuan compared to the previous year. The trade deficit was 123,558,000 yuan, an increase of 8,428,000 yuan compared to the previous year. However, the above figures do not accurately reflect the severity of the impact, as the total value of import trade by customs is converted into national currency based on the legal exchange rate of the gold unit, while the total value of export trade has been automatically adjusted based on the black market exchange rate. If both were converted into pounds sterling at the black market exchange rate, the total value of import trade would be £49,708,000, a decrease of £7,079,000 compared to the previous year, and the total value of export trade would be £31,470,000, a decrease of £18,301,000, while the trade deficit would be £18,213,700, an enormous increase of £11,220,000 compared to the previous year, indicating that the decline in exports was even greater than the decline in imports.

Production Stagnation: This stems from the westward shift of the war and the widening of the war zone. Production enterprises have been greatly damaged, and the output of local goods has naturally decreased. Coupled with the obstruction of transportation and the difficulty of shipping, the only channel for export throughout the year was the Canton-Hankou Railway line, which was also interrupted in the autumn. Fortunately, the government established a trade adjustment agency to actively encourage exports, allowing large quantities of local goods to be exported quickly; otherwise, the decline in the value of export trade would have been even greater.

Grains and Flour: Among imported goods, the largest increase was in grains and flour, totaling 130,004,000 yuan, an increase of over 71 million yuan compared to the previous year. Wheat flour alone increased by over 46 million yuan, and rice imports also increased by 16 million yuan. This is because the inland food supply could not be transported and sold in large quantities due to the war, and coastal ports had to rely on imported food.

Metals and Ores: The largest decrease in imports was in metals and ores, totaling 65,117,000 yuan, a decrease of 66 million yuan compared to the previous year. Various construction projects were suspended this year, and metal transportation was particularly difficult, resulting in a large decrease in imports. The largest import quantities, in order, were grains and flour, miscellaneous goods, oils, candles and soaps, metals and ores, chemical medicines, machinery and tools, paper, and vehicles.

Textiles: The largest increase in exports was in textiles, totaling 165,127,000 yuan, an increase of over 36 million yuan compared to the previous year, mainly due to the increase in cotton exports, mostly to Japan, reaching approximately 10,100,000 yuan, an increase of nearly 70 million yuan compared to the previous year. However, exports of other textiles, such as wool and raw silk, decreased (to be continued).

### Only Practice, Don't Worship

— Shi Chao

What is art? Art is the product of the labor of those who create form.

What is an artist? An artist is a laborer who changes the position of this or that element of the surrounding environment in space, a person whose activities are harmonious.

I used to say this, and I still say it now: "We should learn from any avant-garde or pioneer, but we should not worship them."

We should only call out to the avant-garde of art like the Roman people did to the rich of that time: "Give us bread and beauty... give us beautiful impressions! And these impressions should be rich, diverse, and bright; they must be above average, above what we normally see." We should demand this and prepare to learn and accept, but we should not pray like foolish believers pray to God.

However, the younger generation following the avant-garde mostly misunderstands this. They see every avant-garde artist as something sacred and inviolable. They do not go to the treasure trove of the avant-garde to learn and accept his rich wealth, but only kneel far away, where even the eyes of our avant-garde cannot see, to worship and murmur prayers, enshrining him at home and everywhere... This is so pitiful.

We must know that the avant-garde inevitably passes on the wealth he has received from his ancestors, equally or even more, to his beloved younger generation, as long as they are willing to learn. Ostrovsky said: "He (the avant-garde) distributes the wealth given to him unreservedly to us."

Of course, treating the avant-garde as a lifeless, soulless puppet and worshiping him not only prevents us from extracting his wealth but is also undoubtedly a great insult to him. No matter how talented or profound our avant-garde is, he is still a person with flesh and blood, a soul, advantages, and shortcomings. His theories, his actions, everything he does will be mostly right due to his rich experience and deep cultivation, but we cannot say that everything is absolutely right. The reason is simply that the avant-garde is also a person - no different from ordinary people. It is clear that there is only learning between people, and no worship.

May 20th marks the 50th birthday of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, an avant-garde artist in our country's drama movement. In order to honor this laborer who has resolutely and painstakingly worked in the drama movement for two or thirty years and shed much sweat in the history of China's weak drama movement, theatrical workers throughout Hong Kong are staging the national historical drama "Pan Huagang." This is certainly a very meaningful event, but the meaning of our celebration is not to worship Mr. Ouyang but to learn from him. This point needs to be emphasized.

What should we learn from him?

First is his courage; second is his courage; and third is still his courage in replacing China's old drama, which has existed for thousands of years, with new content and making the most of new forms so that the old drama can adapt to the great combat stage and successfully become a powerful propaganda tool in the process of resisting Japan and building the country.

He courageously took the legacy of advanced Western European dramatists and transferred it to China, resulting in beautiful achievements in China's spoken drama movement.

He courageously stood tall in China's 20-year drama movement, persevering unwaveringly to this day.

He used to study bravely and painstakingly, and he still studies bravely and painstakingly, pouring every drop of attention and spirit into China's spoken drama movement. On the one hand, he generously gives the rich experience he has gained through his labor to the younger generation; on the other hand, he continues to work hard to learn and pursue.

He is brave...

These are all things we should learn from, and I believe he will be very willing to offer everything without reservation, as long as the younger generation does not treat him as an idol to be worshiped but diligently learns from him.

### Trio

— Yang Yanqi

Sea Fantasy

The sea breeze is like an inspiration with a strange smell. I want to spread my wings and fly out of the harbor, floating on the sea, counting the floating ships, singing songs of leaving home. How many people rush to the future with various hearts, reflecting different clear shadows, leaving different moods. In the harbor and on the beach, sons go far away, with white sails sending them on their way. After sending them off, there is another wave of melancholy.

The sea breeze is like an inspiration with a strange smell. I want to dive into the water, swim quietly, explore the secret mansion of the ocean, and search for a pure land on earth. The darkness of the seabed, a piece of green, cannot resist the smoke of war and is also stained with red spots. Following the heart fire of the expeditionaries, it sings the rhythm of justice. Countless hatreds, endless emotions, float to the sea with the bubbles, and the sea breeze blows them away.

The Old Man's White Hair Rhapsody

The ripples on the sea surface reflect the old man's white hair, silver threads.

Each fine, soft white hair conceals a ghost in the bottom of his heart—or perhaps a dead rose.

Youths Love the Mountains, Old Men Love the Sea

Because youths will release their emotions in the mountains, they will run, jump, and accompany the souls outside their bodies. They climb from one mountain peak to another. The sun belongs to them, giving them heat and strength, especially in wartime, crossing mountains and ridges, millions of youths united as one.

Old men will chew the remaining flavors in the depths of their souls on the sea. The moon belongs to them, the eternal brilliance of the moon causes his cold mood to repeatedly fall into the dreams of the past. I remember it was a severe winter one year, the military orders flashed by the golden spears, and the roaring of war drums had exchanged for the heads and livers of many enemies—or, perhaps, in May of a certain year, the spring was not yet old, and the scenery was teasing people to laugh, he had left a paper shadow for a beautiful young girl: and, in the twilight of drizzle, the hazy spring colors of the garden, just leaving the first bit of scenery, he had walked slowly, wanting to seek a heavenly blue crown. Now, the blue crown is only a faint trace on paper, eroded by time.

In the white hair, the twilight of the graveyard is visible again; the evening glow passes through two rows of white fields, truly the sunset is infinitely beautiful, and the spring breeze gently blows the willow branches. Old man... The aftersound of the rhapsody is like a breeze blowing on the sea, causing slight ripples.

A Story Without Poetry

There is a difference between the lives of young people and the lives of old people: the former is a "life of serving"; the latter is a "life of being served."

Therefore, different stories are always spinning in the sea breeze.

This young man loves that; he loves the goddess, he loves eternal beauty. Everywhere he recognizes himself as a waiter, serving everything he loves—as a result, a historical painting of life is engraved on his heart, and when he is old, when he needs to be served, the history of life in his heart becomes a place where smoke floats.

Let's tell a love story (everything in life can be compared to love)

The love of youth is as hot as a flame; when you get old, you find it is ruined. Love should be like smoking: burning pleasantly, inhaling the smoke pleasantly, and throwing it away pleasantly. A smile flows from the old man's beard, laughing at the young man for making a pleasant thing too serious. (But when old men were young, didn't they do the same? This is an entangled soft thread!)

The shadows of golden spears on the battlefield aroused a more peaceful smile in the old man's heart.

I said that old men love the sea; therefore, the image of a kind and pure white old man appears on the sea again.

### In Dinggou

— Tong Shouping

A Brief Record of Mobile Propaganda

Now setting out for the third time, the location is in Dinggou.

Dinggou is about thirty li away from our base area. No one has ever propagated there before. The local situation is said to be quite good, so we decided to go there once. After traveling for three hours, we first arrived at the Dinggou Municipal Elementary School. The principal said he had not returned from the city on official business, and a Mr. Shi represented him to greet us. He expressed a warm welcome to us and said:

"At this time, it is really rare that you can come to our remote and impoverished town, and we are very grateful. Many people here hold the idea of sweeping only the snow in front of their own doors, and they are simply unwilling to listen to national affairs, let alone allow others to talk about them. Today, you have come from afar, and I think it will definitely stimulate them. In fact, our own capabilities are too weak..." Then he modestly showed a smile, and we all laughed along.

Mr. Shi led the students to assemble on the playground. Then Comrade Qiu gave a speech.

A group here began to put up posters and bought paper to write many temporary ones.

A burst of applause erupted on the playground. Comrade Qiu's moving speech was wonderful. Then Mr. Shi gave a supplementary speech. Suddenly, a cheer came from afar. Behind the woods to the west, a column of students was slowly walking and singing songs. I asked Mr. Shi, and only then did I know that their branch principal had received the news and gathered the students to come and participate. We felt extremely excited, watching the line walk into the playground and stand in order. Through Mr. Shi's introduction, we met the branch principal, Mr. Huang. Under the common goal of "For the Sake of the Country," we warmly shook hands and talked.

Gradually, a pale white sun peeked out from the clouds and hung tightly on the treetops on the western pond. The students standing still, after Mr. Shi's instructions, gradually formed a long line, following behind us, walking out of the school gate. In this way, we paraded around the town for a week. The tragic songs and passionate slogans, echoed by hundreds of large and small throats, stirred the entire town, and people were all shocked!

Night gradually enveloped all around. We re-entered the school and began to give speeches. Thanks to Mr. Shi's enthusiasm, he really gave us a great help. In the square outside the school, he specially built a stage for us. As it was getting dark, we hung up a gasoline lamp, which was as bright as day. People from all around flocked from the darkness to this bright occasion, stood still, and stretched their necks, looking at the stage, watching us perform under the bright lights: "Northeast Compatriots" and "The Confused Egg."

More and more audiences gathered. From the stage, we could see the facial expressions of the people standing close, showing anger and joy with the plot. Many people were also involved in acting on the spot. Some thoughtful old grandfathers, old grandmothers who recited scriptures and worshiped Buddha, and some young men like young masters - even more interested in standing in the crowd and staring intently.

The night wind swept across the square, and the temperature dropped even lower. However, we did not feel cold, and the audience did not feel cold either. We resisted until we finished our work. Only then did we put on thick clothes. Finally, people gradually moved and dispersed, leaving a lonely square.

Mr. Shi had prepared accommodation for us long ago. Dozens of desks were pieced together into a giant bed in a school classroom. Two young men, wrapped in eight or nine quilts, spent a cold winter night.

### Illusion

— Dian Chang

I once had a beautiful and ethereal dream. After excessive nervous exhaustion, a sense of desolation arose in my heart. It was as thick as wine, yet as light as water, just as the colors were about to fade.

I... I seemed to be standing on the summit of a high mountain, precarious and majestic. The yellow glow caressed the top of my head, as if it were a crown. White clouds gently soothed my back. Even more proudly, I raised my head, looked up at the sky, my chest steeped in the rich rain and dew, looking down at the myriad things beneath my feet: the winding long rivers, the lush and boundless fields, the square city lying prostrate, the neatly arranged houses, the undulating mountains, the lakes and marshes as clear as mirrors. Occasionally, a few wisps of smoke and mist lightly locked, hazy and misty, wandering like gossamer, lingering and permeating, and far away, outside the azure sky, boundless and infinite... Everything was very peaceful, serene—I wondered: how could there be tranquility and peace here? When did they escape this specialized place? Where did they come from? Was I exhausted, longing for tranquility and peace—the world's sound and peace had long been extinguished, was death the end here, or was this an illusion?

I bid farewell to the ridge of the mountain. I seemed to be lying on the edge of the water, leaning against a boulder, steadily stroking the thriving shallow grass with my hand, moistening and smoothing its fresh fragrance, the nourishment of the black soil. Occasionally, I turned my head and gazed at the old mountain, but it had become a faint gray, the bend in the mountain... as if it were an eyebrow, beautiful but sad!

After a while, the high mountain... was gone, the faint gray... became a vast expanse, a blood-smeared expanse. I was astonished: where to find the vastness? (It turned out that everything before was really an illusion!) A wave of shame struck my heart, so I stood up straight from the boulder—but the boulder had already rotted. How quickly the boulder disappeared! The spine felt stiff, breathing was somewhat suffocated, I waved my hand silently... I went crazy, my frenzy reverberating through heaven and earth—carried by the sad wind to all directions. I don't know where, but an ancient bronze sound of heaven responded: Honglong! I vaguely saw a few crows in the distant trees... looking at the wings of hypocrisy flapping, flapping, hey, is this "tranquility" and "peace"? Hypocrisy, clown! I laughed coldly.

I also heard the faint, weak, intermittent drumming, harmonizing with the cold, desolate wind, like angry frogs, like old cows, even more like cold insects, yet howling even more ghostly. It rustled across the fields, the green among the paths becoming scorched, yellow, withered, rotten. Yet the drumming still tightly embraced the remaining branches and rotten grass, dancing.

Let it dance, this road dance of grass skeletons! ...It was never as thick as wine, nerves were exhausted.

I went through a beautiful and ethereal dream like this. It was never as thick as wine, the nerve Curve was going up. Sober.

### No Need to Wait

— Zhang Zhenshan

How many people have had their careers destroyed by the invading hooves of the aggressor? How many have had their rice bowls shattered by the invading iron hooves of the aggressor? For nineteen months, we have only heard about the growing seriousness of the unemployment problem and the increasing number of the unemployed—especially in Shanghai.

Those who have unfortunately been caught in the whirlpool of unemployment undoubtedly have their only hope and task in earnestly seeking help from relatives and friends to find a job, lingering at the doors of relatives and friends all day long, using humble words and putting a warm face to a cold face.

However, the facts tell us that the result of earnestly seeking help from relatives and friends to find a job now is that nine out of ten times, you will get a few "modern" words of comfort: "It is really difficult to find a job now, but please don't worry, there will always be a way after the final victory..." It seems that there will be jobs available immediately after the final victory. This "modern" saying is not only the best way for those being asked to deal with those seeking work, but also how the unemployed themselves comfort themselves.

We cannot deny that it will be easier to find a job after the final victory than it is now, but we dare not agree with the general unemployed who sit at home waiting for the final victory. Because the construction period in the future will definitely require talents with sufficient knowledge, rich skills, courageous spirit, and strong physique to build a new China. It will certainly not need ordinary, mediocre people with nothing to eat together. In other words, those without knowledge, skills, and physique will still be the dregs abandoned by the times after the final victory, and their future situation may not be better than it is now. On the contrary, those with knowledge, skills, and abilities that are suitable for the needs of real society have the possibility of not being caught in the whirlpool of unemployment even in the present situation, where the huge tide of unemployment is surging.

Therefore, those who have lost their jobs—especially those trapped in the "isolated island"—must not be deceived by the modern words of comfort from relatives and friends, nor can they entrust their hopes to the final victory because of the difficulty of finding a job. As long as they examine themselves first, they can be sure of their fate. If they do not have unique knowledge, skills, etc., they must find ways to remedy their shortcomings, cultivate their knowledge, practice the skills they are interested in, and exercise their weak physique so that they meet the needs of the country and society after the final victory, and they will not have to worry about the whip of unemployment lashing them. Gorky once said: "Only foolish people are afraid of unemployment, and the terror of unemployment only enters the minds of foolish people..." The lesson these two sentences give us is that we should not be afraid of unemployment and create our own ability to overcome unemployment.

In the interior, no matter where, the work of resisting Japan and building the country is tense. There is no place that does not welcome true talents from various departments to jointly complete the great cause of restoration. Talents with knowledge and skills do not need to be trapped on an "isolated island," knocking on the doors of relatives and friends, and humbly listening to a few "modern" words of comfort. Nor do they need to wait for the final victory. If they have a skill, they can stand on the great stage of national liberation and work, exchanging their wisdom and strength for the final victory. Not only will they solve their own hunger problem, but they will also take a step further to solve the entire unemployment problem and solve the livelihood of the majority of the unemployed.

Therefore, we can say that unemployed young people who sit at home waiting for the final victory before thinking of a solution are no different from abandoning their careers themselves.
