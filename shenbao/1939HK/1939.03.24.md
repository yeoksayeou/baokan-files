### Hitler's Second Plan

The other day, newspapers published the content of Hitler's second plan, as revealed by the London "News Chronicle." Three points are worth noting: (1) The targets of Hitler's future demands will no longer be limited to Eastern Europe; the scope has expanded to the entire Europe, even involving Africa. (2) Germany's targets of aggression can no longer be confined to small European countries; it has clearly shown its intention to invade the territories of Britain and France. (3) Hitler will not only plan for himself in the future but also plan for his accomplice, Italy. As Europe is in a state of "the storm is about to break," we should have a profound understanding of this second plan. Here are some of my views:

(1) This second plan further reveals that Hitler's aggression is endless. Last September, the British and French authorities assessed Hitler's actions as the division of a part of Czech territory, the self-determination of the Germanic people. However, in a short time, Germany annexed the entire Czech Republic. Now, German guns are aimed at Romania, and a large-scale troop movement has begun towards Insterburg and Tilsit, two towns on the border between Prussia and Lithuania. According to general European speculation, the crisis of Germany annexing Lithuania is imminent, and Poland is already on tenterhooks. Hitler also plans to incite national socialist parties in various countries to rise up in response and to incite revolution in France. The reactionary nature of "Nazism" is international, and this can be fully recognized here. If Hitler's aggression is completely successful in Eastern Europe, it is believed that he will turn around and attack Britain and France, disrupt the entire Europe, and even the whole world, before long. "Heroic nations" naturally have their destinations.

(2) Hitler also wants to instigate his accomplice, Italy, to make demands on Britain and France, thereby restraining them and facilitating his aggression. Hitler does not fundamentally care for Italy, but because his own foundation is not yet solid, he still needs like-minded countries to be his helpers. Therefore, in the second plan, he is doing his best to bargain with Britain and France for Mussolini. Hitler's approach can both please Mussolini and demonstrate strength to Britain and France, demanding that they let go and not interfere with his tyranny in Eastern Europe. A London dispatch also reported that Mussolini would deliver a sensational speech next Sunday, and it is generally expected that this speech may become the fuse for the next incident. At the same time, it was also reported that Hitler would make a gesture to support Italy's demands before Mussolini's speech. The inside story of the two aggressors colluding with each other is already clear.

(3) Hitler is probably going to support the aggressors in the East, which can both restrain Britain and France and threaten the United States and the Soviet Union. The recent dangerous actions of Germany, Italy, and Japan are all based on collusion. Not long after the joint military and diplomatic meeting of the three countries in Berlin, Italy immediately vigorously helped Franco's troops advance to the French border, and the aggressors in the East also occupied Hainan Island at the same time. At that time, newspapers reported that Hitler demanded that Japan threaten Britain and France in the Pacific. All conspiracies have been exposed by facts. Now that Hitler is engaged in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union's support for various small countries is quite active, and it is believed that Hitler will also instigate Japan to actively advance into northern Manchuria and the northern seas to restrain the Soviet Union – although Japan's restraint will not be effective. Perhaps Japan, which has been cleverly used by Hitler several times, may recently take advantage of the troubled times in Western Europe to actively seek a rapid end to the Sino-Japanese War through military action. In that case, the military unrest of the Japanese army in central and southern China may be even more likely.

(4) Finally, what we should recognize even more deeply is that although Hitler has launched a "Nazi crusade to the East," Germany's strength does not yet allow him to seriously erupt into a second world war. Germany's preparation and strength are not as great as they were before the European War. Although Britain and France are weak, when the aggressor's pressure exceeds a certain limit, it can force Britain and France to unite with the Soviet Union and other small countries to offer strong resistance to Hitler. What Hitler can use today are gestures, not real fighting. Therefore, the implementation of Hitler's second plan may still take some time. Recently, because of Hitler's violence, democratic countries around the world have shown a tendency to unite more closely. Britain has proposed a joint anti-German proposal to the Soviet Union. Although a British-Soviet alliance may not be realized immediately, and a six-nation European conference may not be convened successfully, it is not impossible for Britain and the Soviet Union to abandon their mutual suspicion of the past 20 years and consider the extent of Hitler's advances in order to jointly deal with Germany. There is also a full possibility that a six-power declaration will be issued. The dangerous behavior of Germany and Italy is all about exploiting the contradictions between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and underestimating the cowardice of Britain and France. If Britain and France can abandon their suspicion of the Soviet Union and take further steps to unite, and at the same time give Hitler a powerful gesture, the further dangerous actions of Germany and Italy may be temporarily stopped.

The key to future developments lies entirely in whether Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and small European countries can unite. The main driving force lies in Britain and France. The Soviet Union's proposal to convene a six-nation European conference and jointly organize an "anti-Hitler group" is, according to all parties' speculation, certainly out of sincerity. However, news from London said: "Whether Britain will take the lead in completing the encirclement of Germany depends on the attitude of the small countries." This is a pessimistic phenomenon.

Now is the best opportunity for Britain to win leadership. Although Japan is deploying troops in the northern seas and northern Manchuria, it does not seem to be the time to fight the Soviet Union. Yesterday, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita also revealed the news that the fishing agreement could be resolved satisfactorily. The United States has a deep awareness of the internationalization of National Socialist activities and their penetration into the Americas, and has taken deep precautions. If Britain can express sincerity to the United States and the Soviet Union, it can stop Hitler's arrogance without moving a single soldier. Whether Britain can grasp the leadership of Europe depends on whether it can maintain justice in Eastern Europe and the Balkans!

### Seven Deadly Vices

— Soong Mei-ling

If our country can truly concentrate on internal clearing and reorganization, making it as orderly as a house, then it won't take long for the original face of our nation to be reflected on those shiny fixtures. Because I am eager to see this bright scene, I am driven by this patriotic desire to contribute my share of strength in this overall clearing service, and I am willing to expose the dark corners in the sunlight without hesitation. Of course, many people would rather be simple and avoid medical treatment, but for the glory of the country, for the country to progress in an orderly manner, we must not have any scruples and must assume our due obligations.

What we need is national organization. In fact, this is not difficult. As long as we remove those bad habits that obscure our eyes and hinder our political and social progress, organization will immediately be realized.

First of all, what needs to be mentioned is "factionalism." This seems to dominate our activities everywhere. This concept is so deeply rooted that any undertaking, large or small, is hindered by it and cannot develop. Those who have factional ideas do not take the success or failure of the undertaking as a prerequisite, but take the differences and similarities between factions as a prerequisite. If a person belongs to a faction other than their own, no matter how capable that person is, everyone will try their best to prevent him from obtaining a position in their group, thus producing the bad phenomenon of using private interests to harm public interests. Any talented person with free and independent thoughts and personality will never demean himself to cling to and seek acceptance. Therefore, those who value factions will definitely squeeze out or indirectly try to prevent those who are not members of their faction but are working around them from being at peace in their positions. Therefore, every faction is a gathering place for those who fill positions without qualification. It cultivates corruption and regression, fosters suspicion and double-dealing, and produces cowardice and selfishness. As a result, it not only causes the country to degenerate step by step but also increases the country's useless burden. In short, in factionalism, there is no unity and mutual assistance, only the intuition and actions of a mob.

Secondly, the lack of self-control is also similarly harmful. The fundamental reason for the formation of this bad habit is the lack of spiritual education in schools, or the lack of good role models by officials. Whatever the reason, this is a symptom of lameness. If students are not guided by great spirits when they are in school, how will they know how to overcome bad environments without being influenced by them after they grow up? People who do not know or have the ability to control their own actions must be irrelevant to the interests of the country, or even unaware of the responsibilities of the people, and will not hesitate to take wrong actions that harm the country. As for officials who bear political responsibility, if they lack the ability to control themselves, they can gradually affect their subordinates. Even a gatekeeper will follow suit, living a drunken and dreamy life. It corrodes the fabric of the entire country like oxygen.

Evading responsibility – this is also a common and shameful disease. Among civil servants, its harm is equivalent to a crime. This is what is commonly known as "passing the buck," which was a common practice in officialdom in the past. Officials are very familiar with using an almost instinctive and extremely skillful means to shirk practical responsibilities. Everything can be "none of my business." This is a Chinese characteristic that foreigners cannot understand. Part of the reason is also due to the concept of "face." It seems that pushing away is damaging the other party's "face," and being criticized for not doing well is also losing one's own "face." But the important key lies in ignorance, lack of governing ability, lack of personality, or simply not hesitating to openly obstruct the progress of the undertaking. The impact of this habit is very far-reaching. The promotion and progress of various undertakings, especially in the economic field, have been stagnant and backward because of it.

The extent to which the development of various natural resources has been hindered by evading responsibility is simply incalculable. With this bad habit, many plans for industrial and transportation have been shelved, and many suggestions regarding culture and others that were originally sufficient to improve the people's spiritual and material lives have not been implemented. If something was originally complicated, it becomes even more chaotic due to repeated evasions. Since things cannot progress, responsibility becomes even more unclear. In fact, those who evade responsibility are the ones who should bear the guilt for China's decline. When our descendants write the history of this period, they will clearly distinguish them. But this deserved fair judgment and punishment are only for the future, not for the present. These people who evade practical responsibility are stacked in official positions like wood, as mentioned earlier. Almost every personnel record in every government agency is crowded with these unproductive deadwoods. The origin, of course, is due to the actions of a few people, but when superiors follow suit, those who occasionally refuse to be responsible for national affairs will create many shameless masses. We can only call this group a "army of rice buckets." The officials and soldiers in this army are too incompetent – their senior officials have neither backbone nor conscience to remove them, and although they occupy their positions without doing anything, they accept undeserved rewards without feeling anything, smugly thinking that they have succeeded. Countless people's blood and sweat could have been used properly to hire talented and capable people to promote the progress of the country's undertakings in many aspects, but they are consumed so unjustly and wrongly. How painful!

Furthermore, there is also the vice of self-abandonment, which is often expressed in the gloomy phrase "there's no way." What does this sentence mean? It is always an excuse for irresponsibility, indifference, laziness, incompetence, and a base attempt to avoid difficulties and responsibilities when doing something novel or important. It is also the word that Napoleon said was not in his dictionary. It is also the magic weapon used by the Qing Dynasty officials to eliminate progressive and promising people, because they knew that if they accepted those capable people, their own positions would be shaken. Its effect is equal to "impossible," "can't do it." In the past, this idiom could often be heard in various guardhouses. Today, in this extraordinary period, it is still a shame to hear the echo of this sound wave. The current period is precisely the period when we hope to use it as a complete reform of all unforgivable evil habits in the near future, and to protect ourselves from various deadly poisonous arrows. How can there be "no way" in the world? In this extraordinary period, "there is no way" must also "find a way." Those who use "there is no way" as a mantra are representatives of those who are not attentive and unwilling to work, and they are always the most terrible and harmful elements in the country.

Again, we also have a bad habit, that is, the so-called "almost," which is a common saying on the lips of those who are sloppy, casual, and lazy. Its meaning is the lack of accuracy. It is equal to "let it go" or "the difference is limited." It is the most common term in the language of those who are vague and ambiguous. In the most precise machine manufacturing plant, it is a great danger; it declares the death penalty for the element of "accurate and reliable" that is essential for any recent undertaking or success. Among the many disasters it has caused, we can see the failure of the silk and tea business, because "almost" results in unreliable samples, and the manufacturing and shipping are not meticulous. Don't you hear those who make silk say: "There are some bad cocoons here;" The person in charge, in order to save trouble, goes on to say, "Almost, let it go;" But in a very far away country, someone is saying: "This kind of silk is of uneven quality and useless, we will not buy it next time." This is the benefit that "almost" gives us. Not only is this the case with silk and tea products, but many other aspects of the business have also suffered the same damage.

The seven deadly vices have been explained in order above. In addition to this, there are several other disadvantages that we cannot ignore. For example, jealousy and narrow-mindedness are all bad. Although these disadvantages can be found everywhere in the world, they are harming the country in the long term in China because of the lack of efficiency in everything. Sometimes we are very clever in small things, but very muddled in big things; When we choose and purchase the things that the country needs, we also often have psychological and moral prejudices and evils: and we often forget or are unwilling to comply with the regulations. Some people are in a position to issue orders, but they do not think about whether they have complied with those laws, and at the same time, they do not seriously defend those who have violated these laws, which is considered the worst thing. An illegal matter is usually taken very seriously in other places, but in China, it does not seem to be necessary to take it seriously.

We usually have two important shortcomings when dealing with foreigners. The first is that we often send a layman to negotiate technical contracts, and the second is to use people with insufficient knowledge and poor language skills as translators. Because the meaning of words is not clear and the language cannot be fully integrated, the misunderstandings that occur are imaginable. They have made some stupid and serious mistakes, and no one would believe it if you said it, but I know that there are such things. Even those who are considered competent translators inevitably make unbelievable mistakes. I have really heard a lot of such stories. If it were not for the seriousness of these mistakes, they would be laughable.

In the past, our economic plans with foreigners often failed to produce results, and everyone felt uncomfortable; the reason can be said to have largely occurred because the assigned translators were not capable enough. How to avoid this completely unnecessary separation and easily cause difficult reasons when we hold important negotiations with foreigners in the future is a matter worth serious consideration.

When we discuss or negotiate financial, economic or industrial plans with foreigners, only those who are fully familiar with the technical terms can be used as translators. The losses we have suffered in the past due to translation errors are truly incalculable. China can benefit from the successful negotiation of several plans or issues. We don't have to worry about what has happened in the past, but there is no reason to say that we should continue to suffer this kind of unpleasant loss caused by misunderstanding in the future. All those responsible for negotiations should have high levels of required conditions, the richest knowledge, the noblest character, the fullest understanding, and the most sound imagination. Before proceeding with the negotiations, they should consider how to successfully reach an agreement that is satisfactory to both parties, and even if the negotiations fail, they must be able to give legitimate and sufficient reasons. Those who are incompetent should be punished to show the reasonable punishment that should be given for the failure of the negotiations. In the past, agreements often failed because negotiators failed to profit from them. This is also a bad phenomenon that we should reform and prevent from recurring in the future.

If the above-mentioned vices and bad habits that I have listed are removed or corrected, then the National Spiritual Mobilization Plan resolved by the recent National Political Council can be immediately implemented from theory to practice. At the same time, all crimes of evading practical responsibility, using public office for private gain, and dereliction of duty should be listed as "treasonous" acts, so that everyone will know that they should be abandoned by the people.

The above-mentioned shortcomings combined have prevented our country from making progress for many years. Now we have seen the solution, and I believe that as long as we can show firm perseverance, we can completely eliminate these stains. In fact, these stains must be washed away as soon as possible. We already know the solution; these vices are of course not difficult to cure. Now is really the only time for us to get rid of the old and bring in the new and to teach the dead to survive. Patriotism and national self-esteem make all the people of the country, even the very cowardly and careless elements among them, cannot but wake up, stand up bravely and actively, and respond to this distant and powerful giant sound that is always lingering in our hearts with our self-reliant and self-improving heroic posture and actions, this sound that moves and has power, a word: Resurga – I will be reborn! I pray that all 450 million compatriots of our nation will make a firm cry of "I will be reborn," and use the sound to evolve into power, and use this sound to initiate action, to achieve our "revival of the Chinese nation"!

### Shanghai Youth in Bitter Struggle: Second Phase of the War of Resistance Propaganda Week - Youth Day, Youth of All Circles Issue Joint Declaration

(Shanghai Correspondence) The 7th of this month was the sixth day of the War of Resistance Propaganda Week held under the leadership of the Shanghai Special City Party Department. The youth of all circles in this city have issued a special joint declaration, which is recorded as follows:

Spirit of Sacrifice

Beloved youth of the whole city, youth has always occupied a supremely glorious page in the revolutionary history of our country. As evidenced by the overthrow of the Manchu Qing Dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution and the overthrow of the warlords in the fifteenth and sixteenth years of the Republic of China, the vast majority of those who participated were mainly youth. This glorious feat of sacrifice can truly be immortalized alongside our Chinese nation. Further evidence can be found in the bloody battle of Songhu in April of the previous year, where they directly participated in the frontline battles, splattering hot blood on the enemy, and exacting a considerable price, creating a moving and tearful historical record, as well as doing various political, educational, social, and medical work, indirectly devoting themselves to the war. The majority of these efforts are still attributable to the youth of all circles.

Anti-War Sentiment

Now that we are in Shanghai, which has already been reduced to an isolated island, our anti-war sentiment continues to rise with the years of the city's occupation. Therefore, many in our youth ranks have already gone to the inland to serve in the military, join guerrilla units, and participate in other work that is beneficial to the war of resistance. Even those who remain on this isolated island are united in their hatred of the enemy and are constantly making various preparations for the war of resistance and nation-building. Patriotic actions are still being carried out continuously.

Future Goals

Although our past efforts have already achieved considerable results, at this time when the country is encountering unprecedented national difficulties and the war of resistance enters its second phase, thinking of the great expectations that the country has for youth, and the significant responsibilities that youth should bear for the country, we feel that our past contributions are still somewhat unworthy of the country. It must be known that in extraordinary times, every one of us youth should have extraordinary actions! Therefore, we list three things as the goals of our joint efforts in the future.

First, support Chairman Chiang's Letter to the Youth of the Nation—We must respectfully follow the points proclaimed in Chairman Chiang's Letter to the Youth of the Nation: (1) Participate in wartime mobilization—Each should contribute their efforts according to their knowledge and abilities, regarding fighting as their sacred duty and sacrifice as a matter of course. (2) Receive various trainings—When necessary, we must go to the inland to receive military training in order to acquire the skills to defend our nation and the way to be loyal to the party and love the country, and to receive political training in order to acquire the political literacy necessary to build a nation based on the Three Principles of the People. (3) Promote cultural construction—Intellectual youth must automatically participate in the movement to eliminate illiteracy, jointly carry out correspondence education, and strive to participate in war of resistance propaganda, so that the general public has a correct political consciousness and a considerable level of culture. (4) Promote labor service—Comprehending Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teaching that "life is for service," participate in social production and other activities to develop the national economy, while at the same time deeply entering the people and getting close to the masses, and gaining the faith of the general compatriots through work achievements. (5) Cultivate production skills—Pay attention to the cultivation of science, so that consciousness, words, and actions are all scientific, cultivate a new national character that is organized, precise, and practical, and at the same time receive technical training, and cultivate the skills of livelihood and labor, so that the majority of young people can serve in agriculture, commerce, roads, mines, electricity industry, and the great construction of the country can be completed faster.

Second, vigorously implement spiritual mobilization—We must respectfully follow the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline formulated by Chairman Chiang and its implementation measures: (1) Recognize the common goal—Concentrate will and strength, and strive for the supremacy of the nation, the supremacy of the race, the primacy of military affairs, and the primacy of victory. (2) Practice ethics—Be extremely loyal to the country, practice great righteousness to the nation, and evolve into the virtues of benevolence, righteousness, faith, harmony, and peace. (3) Establish faith in nation-building—Establish the Three Principles of the People, created by Sun Yat-sen, as the highest principle for China's nation-building, so that the country we want to build in our ideal is independent, free, and equal externally, and owned, governed, and enjoyed by the people internally. (4) Transform the spirit—Correct the life of drunken dreaming and death, cultivate an enterprising and vigorous spirit, eradicate the habit of complacency and laziness, break the attempt of selfishness and self-interest, and correct the divergent and complex thinking. (5) Mobilize leadership—In accordance with the mobilization implementation measures, practice it personally, directly and indirectly promote it continuously, so that satisfactory results can be obtained in the shortest time.

Third, earnestly implement the New Life Movement—We must respectfully follow the New Life Movement Outline promoted by Chairman Chiang, earnestly implement propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and achieve the eight characters of neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, and plainness. Therefore, we must (1) militarize life—Thoroughly eliminate the past habits of weakness, looseness, retreat, decadence, and abandonment, in order to cultivate good habits such as clarifying shame and valuing martial spirit, enduring hardship and hard work, loving the country, valuing credit, and valuing simplicity, plainness, keeping discipline, and keeping time. (2) Articize and hygienicize life—In work, strive for strictness and humility, in treating people, strive for sincerity, attack, kindness, and generosity, in handling affairs, strive for speed and precision, in receiving objects, strive for frugality and cleanliness. (3) Proletarianize life—In terms of wealth, advocate thrift and savings, and strive to increase social resources; in terms of labor, pay attention to time and operation, and strive for quantitative increase and qualitative enrichment; in terms of materials, pay attention to the advocacy of domestic goods, and strive for the austerity and love of goods.

### Battle Intensifies in Poyang Lake, Wucheng Town Suffers Light Casualties, Our Army in Western Anhui Recovers Wangjiang

[Special Telegram from Chang'an City, This Newspaper, 23rd] Our various armies in eastern Henan, cooperating with a surprise attack on Xiaoxian County, annihilated more than 400 members of the pseudo-Cangcun Self-Defense Corps in the second district of Xiaoxian County within two hours. The entire force was annihilated, capturing more than 100, including the team leader Wu Chengsan, killing and wounding 150 enemy soldiers, and seizing two cannons, 13 light and heavy machine guns, more than 200 rifles, and 6,000 rounds of ammunition.

[Special Telegram from Chang'an City, This Newspaper, 22nd] More than 500 enemies in Dangcheng west of the Pinghan Railway, as well as Nanbeizhen, were killed by our forces, resulting in more than 200 deaths. Additionally, more than 20 light machine guns, one cannon, and more than 100 rifles were seized.

[Reuters Chongqing, 23rd] Japanese troops in Jiangxi Province are currently attempting to occupy Nanchang, advancing towards Nanchang in six routes. The main force is in Yongxiu, and the scope of the battle is extremely wide, from Duchang on the east bank of Poyang Lake to Wucheng on the west bank, and extending westward to Xi and Wuning.

[Central News Agency Nanchang, 23rd] On the 21st, enemy planes bombed the south bank of the Henan River several times. Our anti-aircraft units responded with fierce fire. One enemy plane was hit, caught fire, and crashed in front of our position. The remaining planes were also damaged and fled in disarray.

[Central News Agency Nanchang, 22nd] The battle situation in Wucheng is very intense. Since the morning of the 18th, two small enemy warships and thirty or forty speedboats have sailed from the Xingzi area and bombarded our Wucheng for more than 500 rounds. All the houses in our city have been destroyed. At noon, more than 200 enemy soldiers attempted to land on Yejiashou, and fierce artillery battles broke out on both sides. One small enemy warship and three or four speedboats were sunk by our forces. The enemy's flames were slightly reduced. On the morning of the 19th, five or six hundred enemy soldiers changed their landing site to Linggongzhou northwest of Wucheng, and then fled south to Hexilong. After half a day of fierce fighting, a part of Hexilong was occupied by the enemy. On the afternoon of the same day, our army counterattacked and recovered Hexi. On the morning of the 20th, the enemy changed its landing site again to the area around Longtoushan and Songmenshan (about 20 li northeast of Wucheng). This area is protruding from the lake surface. Our defending troops fought hard and moved to a new position at noon. The enemy continued to invade Gaoshan, and the fierce battle continued. At 3 p.m., we abandoned Gaoshan. On the morning of the 20th, under the cover of enemy planes, artillery fire, and poison gas, the enemy again attacked Hexilong. Due to strategic considerations, we defended the high ground south of Hexilong and engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy. On the same day, 200 to 300 enemy soldiers also landed at Wanjun Temple west of Wucheng, and have been annihilated by our army.

[Central Fanshi 22] In central Hubei, the enemy has withdrawn its attacking troops for reorganization. Currently, those remaining along the Xiang River are either old and weak remnants of the enemy or hastily assembled bandits and puppets. Judging from the current enemy military strength, the enemy does not seem to have major plans, but the enemy along the Xiang River still harbors the ambition to cross the river.

[Central News Agency Fanshi, 22nd] Wangjiang in western Anhui was recovered by our forces the day before yesterday.

[Central News Agency, A Certain Place in Northern Jiangsu, 21st] A large-scale guerrilla war has now broken out in northern Jiangsu. On the morning of the 20th, the enemy sent three armored vehicles to cover infantry and attacked from Huaian. When they arrived near ××, they were fiercely counterattacked by our defending troops, who drove the enemy back to the north of ××.

[Central News Agency, A Certain Place in Northern Jiangsu, 21st] The enemy entrenched in Huai'an is afraid of our counterattack and is now defending very strictly. They are also allowing civilians to return to the city, ostensibly showing leniency. However, when the enemy occupied the city, they carried out large-scale looting, and the people, stimulated by this, have risen up to participate in the war of resistance.

[Central, A Certain Place in Northern Shandong, 22nd] (1) The enemy recently launched a large-scale attack on Hebei. After our army repeatedly intercepted them along various routes between Qinghe and Weixian, on the morning of the 20th, a certain Wang Regiment of our division engaged in a fierce battle with more than 7,000 enemy soldiers in Jiangjiazhuang, east of Weixian, until evening, encircling and annihilating the enemy. A total of 72 enemy soldiers were killed, 5 vehicles were burned, 2 heavy machine guns and more than 50 rifles were captured, as well as various important documents. In addition, our Zhang Regiment intercepted more than 800 enemy soldiers, 60 vehicles, 3 cannons, and 4 armored vehicles heading for reinforcements from Lin. They engaged in a fierce battle in the area of Shoutun Nujiazhuang. The enemy charged several times and suffered countless casualties.

[Central Xingji, 23rd] The enemy has begun to conscript villagers aged 18 to 20, and the nearby residents have fled. The enemy in Yu County recently claimed that they would block all the passes of the Zhongtiao Mountains and threatened to cut off traffic between Banlu and Jincheng within five weeks. The Tongpu Railway is now laid to the Xiecun roadbed in the western suburbs of Jieding, and construction is underway to Xihucun. It is rumored that it will be extended to Yuxiang. The needed wooden sleepers are being forced by the puppet security team to be cut down, and 4,000 sleepers are being forcibly demanded from the villages west of Jie.

[Central News Agency Xing, 23rd] At the beginning of this month, the enemy gathered more than 7,000 troops in Taiyuan, Xin County, Qingyuan, and other places, and attacked the area below Taiyuan in several routes. After a fierce battle for ten days, more than 4,000 enemy soldiers were killed. One enemy soldier was captured, and dozens of machine guns and rifles were seized. Hekou, Gujiao, Kaikou, Bai, and other places were successively recovered. Currently, the enemy is only occupying Wangfeng Town, and after two night attacks by our forces, they are trapped in the town and dare not go out. The enemy occupying Wufeng Mountain from Gujiao is currently being surrounded and annihilated by our forces.

[Central Changde, 23rd] Military agencies received a telegram from Nanchang stating that large squadrons of enemy planes were taking turns bombing the Xiushui area all day long to cover enemy troops in battle. The battle on the Nanxun Line is very fierce, with our troops confronting each other at Sangongdu in Xiushui. Our side still occupies the advantage.

[Central News Agency Wengyuan, 23rd] On the 19th night, a guerrilla unit of our army suddenly attacked Daliang, and a fierce street battle broke out with the enemy and the puppet army of the traitor Li Daoxuan in the city. The power plant in the city was also destroyed. By dawn, our guerrilla unit had safely withdrawn after achieving its objective. In this battle, dozens of enemy soldiers were killed or wounded, and we also suffered more than ten casualties.

### Yan Xishan Talks About the Shanxi Situation: Our Fifty Divisions of Troops Are Active in Shanxi, Anihilating More Than 10,000 Enemy Soldiers in Two Weeks, A Million-Strong Reserve Army is Being Actively Organized

[Reuters Communication from a Certain Place in Shaanxi] After a week-long journey through Shanxi on horseback and in automobiles, a Reuters reporter arrived at the top-secret headquarters of General Yan Xishan, Commander-in-Chief of the Second War Zone of China, which includes the entire province of Shanxi and parts of the three provinces of Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan. The headquarters is located in a cave city in the mountain range bordering Shaanxi, as the geological structure of the two provinces of Shaanxi and Huang is most suitable for excavating caves, and the Chinese army has fully utilized this point to resist air raids. All the rock walls have been excavated into living rooms, offices, and ancillary facilities. On the evening the reporter arrived, he was invited to stay in a bedroom inside the cave, which was quite comfortable, and was given a single-page daily newspaper published there to read.

The next morning, someone told him that Mr. Yan had agreed to meet. The reporter met with Mr. Yan in another cave, with walls full of maps, which was the location of the staff headquarters. Mr. Yan sat at the head of the desk, wearing glasses, with gray hair and a peaceful expression. He was wearing a blue military uniform of Shanxi Province. To Mr. Yan's right was his chief of staff, Mr. Zhu, a burly man wearing a yellow wool uniform of a central military officer.

Mr. Yan stated, "Japan is strong and China is weak, but we must deal with them closely. Therefore, some people have reformed their strategy and plan to use our strength to attack the weak points of the Japanese. We have now begun a war using the strength of the people of the whole country, and are training soldiers and civilians according to three methods: (1) giving officers special training, (2) training the people, and (3) training the army in guerrilla tactics. At present, China is proceeding in accordance with the following four principles: (1) unity and cooperation between soldiers and civilians, (2) unity between officers and soldiers, (3) seizing opportunities to attack the enemy, and (4) avoiding unnecessary losses."

"One million Shanxi people are currently in training to help the national army break the Japanese barrier. Most of their training is on the political front. We must explain the significance of this war to them, unite them, and give them weapons. They have now made the Japanese rule ineffective. Every time the Japanese occupy a place, the local government and post office move slightly backwards and continue their duties. In Shanxi Province, of the 105 counties, except for the three northern ones that have been merged and governed by one county magistrate, each of the remaining counties still has a county magistrate who exercises his duties according to regulations. Even most of the so-called Han traitors are not truly traitors. Many of them are serving us."

"Shanxi is currently actively preparing for a long-term guerrilla war. There are already a large number of regular troops moving behind the Japanese army and surrounding them, and they have established self-sufficient bases in the mountains. These troops can rely on the countryside for all their needs except for military supplies, because the assistance of the people is readily available. Full attention is being paid to estimating the supply of military supplies."

"There are currently more than fifty divisions of troops in the occupied areas of Shanxi Province, two-thirds of which are regular troops. In the past two weeks, more than 240 battles have occurred within this theater, and more than 10,000 Japanese soldiers have been annihilated. The new strategy now is to avoid large-scale battles, so the above-mentioned are only small conflicts. Because the railways are often cut, the Japanese have begun to build piers along the railway lines, which the Chinese army is preparing to attack. In short, the Japanese will never be able to gain true control of Shanxi."

When Mr. Ge went to the cave where the talks were held, he walked on a specially prepared strong trail back to his residence (Sent from the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters, March 10).

### Chairman of Shanghai Municipal Council Formally Protests to Italian Consul: Italian Troops in Italian Defense Zone North of Suzhou Creek Allow Illegal Enforcement of Duties by Puppet Police

[Associated Press Shanghai, 23rd] The Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, recently lodged a formal protest with the Italian Consul, stating that the Italian side had allowed Chinese members of the Japanese military police to perform duties in the Italian defense zone north of the Suzhou Creek. These Chinese, formerly known as "Avenue Police," were previously engaged in police duties in Japanese-occupied areas.

[Associated Press Tokyo, 22nd] Foreign Minister Arita stated today in response to a question in the House of Peers that "Japan will consider abolishing extraterritoriality and returning the concessions in China. When the opportunity for Japan to return the Japanese concessions arrives, I believe that foreign countries will also return their concessions in China." Referring to Shanghai, he said, "The Shanghai Public Concession and the Japanese authorities have a specific agreement to allow Japanese police to cooperate with the Concession authorities to suppress terrorists. The Japanese side is also planning a similar cooperation with the French Concession, and we hope to achieve effective results."

[Reuters Shanghai, 23rd] The Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Fessenden, protested today to the Italian Consul because the Italian side allowed Chinese members of the Japanese military police to operate in the Suzhou Creek area of the Italian military defense zone. Mr. Fessenden also brought to the attention of the Consular Body that on a recent Japanese parade, a "Shanghai Special Municipal Government" police officer supported by the Japanese appeared armed in Hongkou Park, which is within the Concession area. He stated that the appearance of armed Chinese in the Concession, other than the Municipal Council police, is the main cause of terrorist incidents.

### Military Commission Political Department Drafting Outline for Commemorating the Martyrs of Huanghuagang

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 23rd] The Military Commission Political Department recently drafted the following general outline for commemorating the March 29th Huanghuagang:

Meaning

March 29th is the anniversary of the martyrdom of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang. It was approved by the Fifth Central Standing Committee Meeting on March 1, 1938. The heroic feat of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang on March 29th was a great cause that promoted the Xinhai Revolution and laid the foundation for the Republic of China.

History

The course of March 29th, the Battle of Huanghuagang on March 29th, was the continued uprising after the failure of the Guangdong New Army uprising two years before the founding of the Republic of China. The location was in Guangzhou, and the planning agency for the uprising was located in Hong Kong, with Huang Xing as the commander-in-chief. Xie Shenmu raised tens of thousands of shields from overseas Chinese in Nanyang for funding. During the uprising, Huang Xing led more than a hundred comrades and attacked the Governor-General's Mansion. Later, due to the Guangdong Governor Zhang Mingqi dispatching troops to besiege, it quickly failed. After the failure, the Qing government implemented even greater terrorist policies, and party members and civilians with cut hair were arrested and killed in large numbers. However, the greater the oppression, the fiercer the resistance. The principles have deeply penetrated the hearts of the people, and the revolutionary trend cannot be stopped. Therefore, the Wuchang Uprising on October 10th was launched to carry forward the unfulfilled ambitions of the predecessors and lay the foundation for the Republic of China.

The task of commemorating "March 29th"

(1) It is necessary to inherit the spirit of perseverance and heroic struggle of the revolutionary martyrs of "March 29th," firmly establish the belief that "the war of resistance will surely be won and the nation will surely be built," not seek temporary comfort, not be greedy for difficulties, and carry out the war of resistance to the end. All national agencies and groups must widely and deeply publicize the facts and spirit of the sacrifice of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang and the martyrs to the officers and soldiers of the entire army and the people of the whole country, implement the national spiritual mobilization, so that everyone deeply recognizes that the final victory will surely belong to our country, understands that "compromise midway is destruction," firmly establishes their belief, and encourages them to participate in the war of resistance.

(2) The correct leadership and great sacrifice of the revolutionary martyrs created the Republic of China. At present, Japanese imperialism not only wants to destroy our country, but also wants to destroy our nation. At this time, when we commemorate the martyrs, we must first take the revolutionary martyrs as an example, thoroughly understand the Three Principles of the People and all the legacy, and the leader's instructions and speeches on the war of resistance, and strive to achieve them. Second, we must encourage everyone to actively enlist in the army, rise up to participate in the war of resistance work, drive out the Japanese, and recover the lost territories.

(3) One of the political visions of the revolutionary martyrs was to be able to use the internal contradictions of the Qing government in the successive uprisings to overthrow the Qing court, go deep into various places, and win over the Qing government's troops. Now that we are fighting against the Japanese, we should also step up propaganda against the Japanese puppets, encourage them to go to the rear of the Japanese, and win over the puppet troops to disintegrate the Japanese.

(4) One of the great understandings of the revolutionary martyrs was to advocate equality and mutual assistance among all ethnic groups in the country. At present, our sacred war of resistance is not only a war of resistance for the whole people, but also a war of resistance in which all ethnic groups in the country are united. This is to step up the awakening of the minority ethnic groups in the country, strengthen the unity of the minority ethnic groups in the country, and respond to the Japanese conspiracy to divide us.

(5) The revolutionary martyrs carried out continuous propaganda and organization movements among overseas Chinese, and repeatedly received great assistance from overseas Chinese. From this enthusiastic assistance, we must never ignore the status of overseas Chinese in the war of resistance. In fact, overseas Chinese have also contributed great strength since the war of resistance. We should also strengthen our work with overseas Chinese, especially to make full use of the capital of overseas Chinese to carry out the construction of the national defense economy.

Slogans

Our slogans are: (1) Commemorate March 29th, to inherit the spirit of sacrifice of the revolutionary martyrs; (2) Commemorate March 29th, to complete the nation-building ambition of the revolutionary martyrs; (3) Support the National Government, obey the supreme leader; (4) Implement the Three Principles of the People; (5) Commemorate March 29th to implement the spiritual mobilization; (6) Commemorate March 29th to strengthen domestic unity; (7) Commemorate March 29th to mobilize overseas Chinese capital; (8) Commemorate March 29th to carry out the war of resistance to the end; (9) Commemorate March 29th to disintegrate the Japanese army; (10) Commemorate March 29th to win over the puppet army; (11) Commemorate March 29th to actively enlist in the army; (12) Commemorate March 29th to work hard for the war of resistance; (13) The spirit of the revolutionary martyrs will never die; (14) Down with Japanese imperialism; (15) Long live the Republic of China; (16) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang; (17) Long live the leader.

### Report of Cheng Qian's Death Denied by Officials

[Reuters Chongqing, 23rd] Japanese rumors that Cheng Qian, Commander-in-Chief of the Northwest Region Army, was injured in a bombing in Lanzhou on February 23 and died on Tuesday have been denied here. According to reports, Cheng Qian was not in Lanzhou on February 23 and has never been injured since the beginning of the war of resistance.

### Japanese Troops in Beijing and Tianjin Search for Legal Tender

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 22nd] Tianjin News: In the name of searching for legal tender, Japanese troops in Tianjin have been strictly inspecting pedestrians and vehicles entering the concessions outside the concessions since the 16th. All those carrying legal tender and central auxiliary coins are detained, and the currency is confiscated. In Beijing, Japanese military police began searching banks and money shops on the 15th for the receipt and release of gold and legal tender, causing unrest in the market.

### Shanghai Municipal Government Archives: The Public Works Department Refuses to Hand Over Files to the Puppet Regime

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] After the withdrawal of the National Revolutionary Army from Shanghai, the files of the Shanghai Land Bureau were entrusted to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession for safekeeping. Now, as the reorganized Land Bureau lacks these archives and cannot function, it has earnestly requested that [the KMT] negotiate with the Public Works Department for their return. The Public Works Department, refusing to recognize the puppet organization, has sternly declined, stating that it will not hand over these archives to anyone without the consent of our central government.

### Foreign Minister Wang Denies Rumors: Reports of Resignation and Departure to Hong Kong are Entirely Groundless

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] A certain foreign reporter, using a Japanese official title for Foreign Minister Wang, claimed that he had already resigned and gone to Hong Kong, and that the reason for his resignation was due to differences of opinion with the central government. This agency specifically inquired at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to verify the truth. Foreign Minister Wang happened to be at the ministry and graciously granted an interview, stating that this was purely a fabrication and not worth a smile. Last December, [the Japanese] claimed that he had gone to Hanoi, and now they say he has resigned and gone to Hong Kong. In reality, since arriving in Chongqing from Wuhan at the end of last July, he has not taken a single step away from Chongqing. The Japanese rumors are self-defeating. As for his handling of foreign affairs, it is entirely based on the central government's policies, and he deeply believes that the current policies of the central government are the only path to resisting the Japanese and building the nation. The claims that he has differences of opinion with the central government and has already resigned are all groundless, deceptive words intended to deceive others.

### Madame Chiang Kai-shek Comforts Wounded Soldiers in Guilin

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 23rd] Madame Chiang Kai-shek (Soong Mei-ling) has prepared 1,500 sets of undershirts, 3,600 towels, and 3,000 bars of soap to comfort wounded soldiers. Liu Qingyang has been specially sent to deliver these items to the wives of Li and Bai, who will then distribute them to the wounded soldiers in Guilin.

### National Government Issues Order: Praising Chiang Fang-chen

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] On the 22nd, the National Government issued an order stating that Chiang Fang-chen, advisor to the Military Affairs Commission and acting president of the Army University, was well-versed in military strategy and had written extensively. In recent years, he participated in military planning, and his strategies and plans were of great assistance. He devoted himself to cultivating talent to alleviate the national crisis. Unfortunately, he passed away due to overwork. The government deeply mourns his loss and has issued a special order to commend him, posthumously promoting him to the rank of General, providing funeral expenses of 5,000 yuan to be handled by the Military Affairs Commission according to regulations, and preserving his biography in the National History Museum to express the government's utmost respect for virtuous men. This order is hereby issued.

### Reliable Report from American Diplomatic Circles: Our Unity Grows Stronger

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] Diplomatic circles here have received reliable reports from the Chinese mainland stating that China's unity is growing stronger. Chiang Kai-shek will likely support the war for an indefinite period. The tension in Europe will not affect China's war of resistance, as large quantities of military supplies continue to flow into China from the Soviet Union. Throughout the country, there is increasing trust in the central government. The Japanese deployment of troops on the Soviet border is not worth emphasizing, as Japan would not dare to act rashly unless an incident occurs in Europe.

### Chongqing City Population: Compulsory Evacuation Planned by Garrison Headquarters, Limited to 150,000 in the Future

### Awakened Japanese Prisoners of War: Zhongshan Bao and Others Voluntarily Practice Economy, Write Articles to Promote the Donation Movement

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 22nd] The ongoing thrift and donation movement has seen enthusiastic participation from all walks of life. Prisoners of war in the XXXXX POW camp were deeply moved upon hearing this. Prisoners such as Zhongshan Bao voluntarily requested permission to participate in the donation movement by "reducing their food consumption" to express their sincere sentiments. Zhongshan Bao donated one yuan from five days of reduced food expenses, while Xia Jiulang and others donated a total of two yuan and eight jiao from two days of reduced food expenses, and three yuan and eight jiao from clothing expenses. Zhongshan Bao also wrote an article on thrift and donation, describing the great significance of the donation movement. A translated version is as follows:

According to the camp director, "Dear Chinese comrades, I heard that you are practicing thrift and donation. After hearing this, I immediately requested the camp director to reduce my living expenses to sanction the violent Japanese militarists and financial cliques who are disrupting East Asia and continuing their war of aggression. I also practice donation. After being permitted, I will now practice and say a few words that everyone knows. During the European War, how did the French people work in the rear and work for national salvation? To save the country, even if they fall into poverty, they don't 'complain'. Everyone practiced economy. From spring to autumn, they wear simple clothes as much as possible, almost naked. Everyone is diligent in their duties and strives for production. The harvest from farming is distributed as follows: for example, out of four bags of wheat harvested, three bags are used for agricultural taxes, fertilizer costs, food, etc. The remaining one bag is used for thrift and donation. After that, they eat barley or oats to maintain their family livelihood. They truly forget all poverty for the sake of the country's future, until they win the war, achieve true peace, and the people's comfort and happiness are also achieved. For the sake of the comfort and happiness of the Chinese and Japanese people and the peace of East Asia, I am willing to be a sacrifice and strive to defeat these imperialist militarists and financial cliques. This is what I swear to my dear Chinese compatriots. Social life is infinite. For China, which has a thousand years of historical culture and is admired, for the eternal peace and true happiness of the people of East Asia, and to wish the Chinese army, which is fighting hard, victory, I believe that a unified country practicing thrift and donation is more important than anything else. This is what I sincerely hope. I hope that my dear Chinese compatriots will redouble their efforts to encourage and implement thrift and donation for the great victory and peace of East Asia in the future, as well as for the comfort and happiness of the people living in hardship. This is what I silently pray for and request before my Chinese compatriots. March, 28th year of the Republic of China, Zhongshan Bao."

### Weekly Battle Situation on All Fronts: From March 16th to March 22nd

—Announced by the Military Affairs Commission—

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission stated that there have been no large-scale battles on the northern and southern fronts this week. The Japanese army is likely exhausted and is engaging in replenishment and adjustment in an attempt to re-offend and struggle for the life of its country. However, under the situation where our entire army is taking advantage of the Japanese army's weaknesses, and secretly depleting the Japanese army, the Japanese army has suffered extremely deep damage and is also worthy of reporting. In terms of the overall war situation, it can be described as follows:

Guangdong Front

The Japanese army in the area has been mobilizing frequently recently, purely to create a false impression. On the one hand, they are stepping up the construction of defensive works on the West River, Yuehan, and other lines. In Haikou and Xiuying on Hainan Island, they are rushing to build forts. In Wenchang, Ding'an, and Yaxian, they are opening up aircraft warehouses and airfields to establish air force bases, as if to be trapped and occupy them for a long time. As for sporadic battles, our two armies have engaged in fierce battles in XXXXX, Daliang, XXXXX, Anding, Wenchang, and Qiongshan. In the Battle of Qiongshan, Japanese Colonel XXXXX was killed. Japanese aircraft also flew repeatedly to Qingyuan, Daqiu, Luotang, Hengshi, Lidong, and other places in England to carry out indiscriminate bombing. Our officers and soldiers fought bravely, killing more than a thousand Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army blindly dropped bombs, and our losses were minimal. At present, the Japanese army on all fronts is under our absolute control and cannot make progress.

Northern Jiangxi Front

The Japanese army invading Mount Lu has been repeatedly severely damaged by our army and has been quiet for many days. A few days ago, a remnant of the Japanese army, covered by six aircraft, once again moved towards Jianghanpo, attempting to invade XXXXX Ridge. After our defending army met with fierce resistance, more than a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed. Our artillery fired accurately and damaged one Japanese aircraft. The Japanese army was defeated in a panic and gained nothing. The battle of Duchang is still very fierce. After our counterattack to capture XXXXX County, we continued to capture XXXXX Daji. The Japanese army, which continued to land on the South Lake surface, was greatly frustrated. Another four or five hundred Japanese troops landed at XXXXX Liudeng, east of Dean, across the lake from Wucheng Town, attempting to spy on and echo each other. They were heavily damaged and killed by our fierce artillery fire. The Japanese army on the north bank of the Xiushui River fired more than a thousand shells at Yao Lin Gou XXXXX Ridge from the afternoon of the 17th, most of which were XXXXX tear gas shells. They used 500 infantry to cross the river in the vicinity of ShanjXXXXX, Macun Guanxige Chencun, with a tendency to invade Tujiapu. After our brave counterattack, the fighting was extremely fierce, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. They are still fighting.

Shanxi Front

More than a thousand Japanese troops trapped in Fushan in eastern Jin have been constantly attacked by us in the past ten days. The Japanese have suffered many casualties, and most of them have fled west. More than 500 Japanese troops remaining in XXXXX were besieged by our army on the afternoon of the 17th. After several hours of fierce fighting, more than 300 Japanese troops were killed. The remaining Japanese troops were unable to support themselves and fled towards Linfen. At 7:00 p.m. that night, we captured the county seat. In An'yi, XXXXX County, and other places in Jin, our armies have engaged in repeated engagements. In the Battle of Lingjin on the afternoon of the 19th, Su Chaoqun's unit of the puppet imperial army, which had a thousand fully equipped soldiers, took the opportunity to revolt and defect to our side when our army approached the Japanese position. The Japanese were attacked from both sides and suffered hundreds of casualties and have been in decline ever since. Since we captured XXXXX County on the 11th, the Japanese launched a counterattack on the 19th, with fierce artillery fire. Our army fought the Japanese army all day with a determination to die. The positions changed hands several times. At the same time, another unit of our army took advantage of the Japanese army's dispersed forces and launched a surprise attack on Jingle, north of the city, annihilating more than 300 Japanese troops. Jingle is still under our siege.

Henan Front

The Japanese army stationed in Shuiye Town, Anyang, led by Japanese Captain XXXXX Yamamoto, launched an attack on XXXXX Town at noon on the 19th. Our garrison troops and local militia resisted, and after XXXXX hours of fierce fighting, more than 200 Japanese troops were killed, and Yamamoto was also killed at the same time. The remaining Japanese troops were unable to support themselves and fled in panic. Now they have directly attacked Shui Zhi, which can be captured immediately. The Japanese army stationed in XXXXX fired artillery shells at Nanhedu, Gong County, Xishui, Xishui Village, and the railway station on the 16th and 17th. After our army returned fire, the Japanese army was suppressed. Another elite unit of our army also attacked the back of the Japanese army on the north bank of the Hebei River. The Japanese were killed and injured severely, and the remnants fled towards Wuzhi Qinyang. A unit of the Japanese army in Sanliuzhai, northwest of Zhongmu, launched an attack on Laitongzhai at noon on the 19th. After five hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese were unable to support themselves and fled back. We took advantage of the victory to advance to Yangqiao, annihilating more than 100 defenders. We captured the area. The Japanese army dispatched a large number of reinforcements from Kaifeng and launched a fierce counterattack, releasing a large amount of gas. Our army, because the army was destroyed, still withdrew back to Laitongzhai to engage in XXXXX. In the evening, the Japanese army came like a tide. Because the number of people was vastly different, we temporarily withdrew from the village and are now actively arranging new positions and reinforcements for a counterattack.

Central Hubei Front

Since the fall of Zhongxiang, the Japanese army has been actively building the Hanyi Jingzhong highways and rushing to build fortifications in the Yangzi (ten kilometers north of Zhongxiang) Jinmenchong (twelve kilometers north of Yangzi) area to engage in solid defense. Therefore, the war situation on this front has been silent this week. However, the Japanese army in Duobao XXXXX constantly shelled Shayang on the opposite bank in an attempt to probe. After our shelling, we actually hit the Japanese powder magazine. The Japanese suffered surprisingly heavy losses. The Japanese at the Sigan ferry in the southeast of Duobao once tried to land at Zhang XXXXX and Hongmiao, on the west bank of XXXXX between the XXXXX and XXXXX on the 15th, 17th, and 18th. After our army’s painful attack, the Japanese XXXXX suffered extremely heavy casualties and failed to succeed. Now, in each of these areas, there is no trace of the Japanese army, and the rest is still river artillery warfare, forming a confrontational state. The attempt to consolidate the east bank of the Xiang River has been extremely difficult for the Japanese army under the four-sided attack of our army. We have been attacking Xiang XXXXX for several days, our artillery fire is fierce, the Japanese position has been completely destroyed, and 200 Japanese have been killed. Another unit of our army captured Wangjiang County on the 16th, killing countless Japanese troops. On the 19th, our army in Xuzhou, Jiangsu, west of Jiangsu, fought fiercely with more than a thousand Japanese troops at Huangkou XXXXX Station, killing more than 200 Japanese troops. The Japanese fled in panic. Above Zhenjiang, in the Zhengjiazhuang area, more than 2,000 Japanese troops surrounded us in eight directions. After our officers and soldiers fought on separate routes, they killed more than 600 Japanese troops. The Japanese suffered heavy losses and retreated. After these battles, the Japanese so-called Jiangsu-Anhui sweep plan was completely shattered, and our strategy of turning the Japanese rear into the front has proven its effectiveness.

### Anglo-French Military Cooperation: Prevents Germany from Dominating Central Europe, Progress Made in Peace Conference

[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] According to a special correspondent from Havas in London, after consultations between British Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and French Foreign Minister Bonnet yesterday afternoon, they unanimously agreed that Britain and France must stand up to prevent Germany's attempt to dominate Central Europe. It is reported that Bonnet has sent a written promise to the British government, expressing France's readiness to participate in Anglo-French cooperation in any way without restriction. The correspondent further said that Britain and France will provide mutual assistance in the event of German aggression, which is also clearly stated, and will be automatically implemented at that time, even if the attack is indirect and comes from the Netherlands, Belgium, or Switzerland. This move will not change.

[Reuters, Rome, 22nd] French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax in London for an hour and a half this evening to discuss the international situation.

[Associated Press, London, 23rd] According to sources in political circles, after discussions between Chamberlain, Halifax, and French Ambassador to Britain Corbin, there has been progress in convening an anti-aggression conference. Several countries will participate in this conference, but there is no definite news yet. However, political figures generally believe that the nine countries of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Poland, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Romania will participate. The Scandinavian and Baltic countries may also be invited to participate. The purpose of the conference is to unite all countries to maintain peace.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] The four-power declaration proposed by Britain for Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland, expressing that if Germany takes further action, joint action will be taken. The Soviet Union and Poland have not yet replied. The drafting of this declaration was completed on Sunday and awaits responses from the governments. There may be revisions to it, so it must wait for several days before it is completed. Britain is also deeply aware of the difficult position Poland is in, and hopes that Poland's wishes can be achieved. The nature of the aforementioned declaration is only that if the situation in a country other than the United States is threatened, the declaring countries will immediately discuss countermeasures. This can also be regarded as a prelude to future substantive steps for countries to discuss.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 23rd] The official here recently published a statement, implicitly hinting that if Germany's power extends outward from Memel again, it will conflict with Poland's interests. The statement solemnly declared that Poland considers the Baltic Sea region to be directly related to Poland's interests.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 22nd] Polish Foreign Minister Beck today received the British Ambassador and the French, German, Romanian, and Hungarian envoys. Observers here believe that Poland's situation is extremely difficult. The fate of Memel has made Poland even more uneasy about Germany's encirclement. Publishing a declaration of ill will towards Germany will inevitably lead to unfortunate consequences, especially as Germany respects Poland's position in Danzig and Pomerania, which is also due to Poland's non-alignment with policies against Germany.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 22nd] It is generally believed that when the British Ambassador met with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck today, he presented the UK's new proposal for a joint anti-aggression declaration.

[Associated Press, London, 23rd] Secretary of Commerce Stanley said that the situation caused by recent political developments has made it impossible for Anglo-German commercial negotiations to make further progress.

### German Troops Entered Memel Yesterday Morning, Hitler Arrived in Memel, Gave a Speech Boasting of Military Prowess, Lithuania Promulgated a Special National Defense Law

Today, all walks of life in Tilsit are taking a holiday.

[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] Hitler changed from taking the fire ship to taking the waterway today, taking the Swinermunde warship to Memel, escorted by a fleet of cruisers and destroyers.

[Reuters, Memel, 23rd] Hitler arrived here after 1:00 p.m. today, not as previously reported at 9:30 this morning. After Hitler arrived here, he drove to the theater square to answer the cheers of the crowd. He gave a speech to the people of Memel, saying, "I led you back to the motherland. You have never forgotten the motherland, and the motherland has never forgotten you. You were abandoned by a weak Germany, and now you have returned to a strong Germany. The world may express dissatisfaction with this matter, but the population of the new Germany is now 80 million. Our unity will never be broken, and no other country can break our unity. Twenty years of suffering can be our lesson. We do not want to harm others, but we will never tolerate the harm others inflict on us. XXXXX We have achieved our goal of revenge. I wish you the youngest citizens of the Greater German Reich." Hitler's speech lasted eight minutes.

[Reuters, Kaunas, 22nd] Neumann Both, the leader of the Memel Germans, said at the first meeting of the new Memel Congress tonight, "Memel has been annexed to Germany." He has sent a telegram to Hitler to express his gratitude. The meeting ended with the singing of the German national anthem.

[Reuters, Kaunas, 23rd] Lithuania issued a special national defense law today.

[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] Germany and Lithuania signed a treaty this evening, including a non-aggression pact.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 22nd] Regarding the issue of the Memel Autonomous Region, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbsys and Ribbentrop signed a treaty after negotiations. The main points are four: (1) Lithuania returns the Memel region to Germany; (2) Lithuanian troops and police withdraw immediately; (3) the area is designated as a free port for the use of Lithuania; (4) both parties agree to avoid using force and do not allow third countries to use violence against either signatory.

[Reuters, Kaunas, 23rd] It is reported that a number of Lithuanians have been arrested in Memel.

[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] The State Department remains silent on Germany's occupation of Memel. American officials are clearly less concerned about the recent Memel incident than the previous annexation of Czechoslovakia.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Secretary of the Interior Sir Hoare said in a speech in the House of Commons on the 22nd, citing the Memel incident, "I have no special report on the situation in Central Europe. The Lithuanian Foreign Minister received a notice from Germany while in Berlin that it was required to immediately cede Memel. Germany threatened Lithuania that if Lithuania resisted or sought help from other countries, Germany would handle the matter militarily. This requirement is equivalent to an ultimatum, and the Lithuanian government must decide within about four days. Germany XXXXX gave assurance that if this request was accepted, it would not make any other requests. It is now known that the Lithuanian government has accepted this request. Because Lithuania has not sought help from the British government since the request was made, the Prime Minister will have a more detailed report on this matter."

### Schedule for British King and Queen's Visit to America is Set

### Hungarian-Romanian Border: Clash Between Two Armies; German Troops Reach Hungarian Border

[Associated Press, Bucharest, 23rd] The city is in a state of war. Fully equipped troops are moving through the streets. The 300,000 reservists originally stationed in southern Romania have been ordered to assemble, increasing the country's defense strength to 500,000. People are rushing to buy salt and sugar, leading to shortages. Women everywhere are weeping, fearing their husbands will be drafted into the army.

[Reuters, Bucharest, 22nd] According to official sources, Germany is now mediating the tense situation on the Hungarian-Romanian border. It is reported that Germany has forced Hungary to reduce the number of mobilized troops. If Hungary complies, Romania will naturally follow suit.

[Associated Press, Budapest, 23rd] According to unofficial sources, Hungarian and Romanian troops have clashed on the border, resulting in three Romanian deaths. Romanian officials announced this evening that the mobilized garrison area will be expanded to the border zone. Another official statement said that if neighboring countries order demobilization, Romania is willing to do the same. Foreign visitors say that military activity within Hungary is becoming more frequent, and it is believed that a large number of troops have been called up. It is also reported that German troops have advanced from Czechoslovakia to the Hungarian border today, but this military action is not directly targeted at Hungary.

[Reuters, Bucharest, 22nd] According to official sources, the leader of the German economic delegation, Herr Huldah, has extended his stay. German-Romanian negotiations have continued, and today's negotiations are progressing well. An agreement may be signed within the week. If so, Romania will not be entangled in political constraints or grant Germany complete control over Romanian commerce.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Today, Home Secretary Hoare, on behalf of the Prime Minister, replied to the House of Commons, stating that the German-Romanian economic negotiations had made some progress recently. The Romanian government denies that the German government issued an ultimatum during the negotiations. At the same time, due to the instability of the situation, the Romanian government has taken some preventive measures. Hoare, in response to a supplementary question, said that it is heard that the German representatives have returned to Germany. Undersecretary Butler said that Romania has also taken into account the wishes of the British government, that is, to continue to ship gasoline products to Britain. This issue will also be one of the negotiation topics for British-Romanian commercial authorities in the future.

[Central News Agency, London, 23rd] The Romanian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Tilea, will return to his country within days. He visited the British Foreign Office yesterday, having been ordered to return home by his government to report on the British government's attitude towards recent events, and the actions the British government will be prepared to take in the future if Romania faces economic or territorial threats from Germany.

### Italian Reservists Enlist; Mussolini to Deliver Speech; Demands to Be Made on France

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Mussolini will deliver a speech on Sunday, and there is much speculation about the scope of his colonial demands. It is believed that Mussolini will frankly explain his demands, but in a calmer tone. Given Mussolini's realistic understanding, he will not issue France an ultimatum-like demand or make a resolution difficult. Some parties in France genuinely want to discuss this issue with Mussolini at length. It is rumored that some individuals will shuttle between the two governments.

[Associated Press, Budapest, 23rd] Italy has also ordered the conscription of five classes of technical personnel. It is heard that 300,000 people will be enlisted by the middle of next week.

[Associated Press, Rome, 22nd] According to authoritative sources, Italy has been actively preparing in recent days. A large number of reservists and technical personnel have been called up. According to well-informed sources, reservists from 1901 to 1904 are included in the enlistment. All military personnel are ordered to report by midnight on Thursday.

[Associated Press, Paris, 23rd] The French government is eager to obtain confirmation of news of German military activity on the Swiss border and in the Po Valley region of Italy.

Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and the Duke and Duchess of Kent were all present. After receiving the welcome and delivering a speech, the French President raised a glass in a toast, responding that the welcome he and his wife had received made him believe even more that understanding and cooperation between Britain and France had been established. The people of the two great capitals, after eight months of relations, have unanimously expressed their agreement. Finally, the French President stated, "I have heard clearly the voices of Londoners. Some of the most admirable principles in the modern world were born in these places." "The past experiences and joys of the people of Britain and France have united the two capitals and have forged the permanent unity of the two countries' friendship." Before leaving the conference hall, the French President specially presented the Mayor of London with 500 gold pounds to be used to help the poor in London.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Amid thunderous applause, Undersecretary Butler announced in the House of Commons today that the government has decided that the Chargé d'Affaires of the Czech Embassy, his diplomatic staff, and the staff of the Czech Consulate will maintain their original status without any changes.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, when introducing the second reading of the bill to prohibit the transfer of Czech deposits out of Britain in the House of Commons today, stated, "Of the £10 million loan from the British government to Czechoslovakia, £3.25 million was handed over to the government before the German invasion of Czechoslovakia. Part of this sum came from the £4 million donated by the central government to aid Czech refugees, and another part came from the £10 million loan to Czechoslovakia, which the government promised to repay. The British government believes that this money can be repaid. At the same time, of the £4 million allocated to aid Czech refugees, £750,000 has already been withdrawn for this purpose."

Jewish Employees to Be Dismissed

[Reuters, Bucharest, 23rd] According to official announcements, Jewish employees within Bohemia will be dismissed and removed from trade unions. So far, only a small number of Jews have been allowed to leave the country because officials have determined that they are not political suspects. Trade associations have distributed Aryan labels to be displayed in non-Jewish shops, but trade in Jewish shops continues as usual. Arrests have been suspended, and many people have been released.

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] The Senate passed the Government Reorganization Bill today. The bill is intended to grant President Roosevelt certain powers. The bill has also been passed by the House of Representatives and will be submitted to Congress for discussion.

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a closed-door meeting today and passed a resolution stating that the next meeting on March 29 will specifically discuss the new Neutrality Act. At the meeting, the committee heard reports from Under Secretary of State Welles, former Chief of Naval Operations Leahy, and Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army Marshall, who all stated that Senator Pittman's proposal for the United States to provide warships, firearms, and weapons to South American countries would effectively reduce the threat of aggressive forces in the Western Hemisphere. Some members of the committee wanted to discuss the situation in the American Samoa, but Pittman dismissed it as going beyond the scope of the topic. It was generally agreed that the changes in American Samoa would not affect the European situation. Today, a similar proposal was made in the House of Representatives regarding American Samoa, but Representative Hanning dismissed it with the same opinion as Pittman.

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] Today, the U.S. House of Representatives Military Committee passed a bill approving the government's allocation of $177.7 million for the construction of coastal defenses and the replenishment of urgently needed equipment for the army. Regarding the proposal to expand the air research facilities at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia at a cost of $2.14 million, it was also approved after taking into account the report of the government advisory committee. The report recognized that the reason Germany can manufacture military aircraft superior to those of the United States is that it has aviation research facilities far superior to those of the United States.

[Reuters, New York, 22nd] The Navy Department today signed a contract with United Aircraft Corporation to manufacture aircraft parts worth approximately US$5 million.

Brief Commentary

### "Factionalism" and Jealousy, Narrow-Mindedness

Today, this newspaper publishes an article by Madame Chiang Kai-shek (Soong Mei-ling), "Seven Deadly Diseases," on page two. When explaining the seven chronic diseases of our country, she specifically lists "factionalism" first and vehemently condemns the evils of jealousy and narrow-mindedness. At the current crucial moment when the Second Phase of the War of Resistance is about to begin and the prospects of national revolution are immense, it is particularly worthy of universal reflection.

Mr. Zhu also said: "All talented individuals with independent thought and personality will never demean themselves to attach themselves to curry favor. Therefore, those who focus on factionalism will certainly exclude or indirectly make it difficult for those who have not joined their faction but are working around them to feel at ease in their positions. Consequently... it cultivates corruption and decline, fosters suspicion and pettiness, and breeds baseness and selfishness, ultimately not only causing the country to gradually degenerate but also adding useless burdens to the country. In short, in factionalism, there is no unity or mutual assistance, only the instinct and impulse of a rabble." This can be considered a "penetrating critique of current malpractices." We hope that those in power will take it to heart as a warning for employing people and handling affairs.

At the same time, we should further recognize that in the current critical stage of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, all jealousy, narrow-mindedness, and factionalism are enough to cause internal friction, alienate national unity, hinder the future of the War of Resistance, and indirectly help our enemies and traitors. It is something we cannot tolerate for a single day. However, to thoroughly eradicate these chronic diseases and evils, on the one hand, we hope that those above will lead by example; on the other hand, and more importantly, it lies in the establishment of a democratic legal system, especially today, the provincial, municipal, and county councils must be established as soon as possible. As genuine local public opinion organs, only when public opinion is given normal expression and only when the connection between the government and the people becomes increasingly close, can all the evils of "factionalism" and jealousy and narrow-mindedness be easily discovered and eradicated.

### Shuster's Travelogue

The Youngest Capital, A New Focus of European Change

In view of the severe trend of the Central European situation, we feel that Bain and Whitacre's description of Shuster, the capital of Carpatho-Ukraine, is particularly relevant and timely.

We know that Berlin's decision to rename Ruthenia as Carpatho-Ukraine is a major blow to the status quo in Central Europe. Carpatho-Ukraine is certainly not an independent country, but a province under the federal republic of Czechoslovakia. However, she enjoys a large degree of autonomy, and at present, due to her position in national communications, her autonomy has expanded significantly.

Ukraine itself feels that it should become the foundation of a huge force consisting of Galicia, Bukovina, Bayyin-Rabia—and, of course, the vast area inhabited by the Ukrainian people after the Soviet Union's split. Ukrainians claim that the population is at least 40 million worldwide.

The new capital, Shuster, is located at the eastern end of the narrow strip of the Czechoslovak Republic, very close to Hungary and not far from the Romanian border.

Shuster is clearly a remote market town that is not easily accessible to the general public. Looking at the map, the easiest route to Shuster is to cross the Laipei Mountains not far from Laipei and then take a train. So I went to Laipei first. But there, the border was closed.

Failing to go from Laipei, I tried to go from Krakow. But there, I couldn't buy a ticket to Shuster. Worse, I couldn't buy Czech silver coins because of rumors that the currency was about to be devalued, and Polish banks no longer exchanged them. But I finally exchanged five shillings and bought a military ticket across the border to Chirlina, and we were told to inquire there about the route to Shuster.

No one knows how to get there

But when I arrived in Chirlina, it was dark and raining, and no one knew how to get to Shuster. Therefore, I accepted the advice of a Hungarian traveler and ran to Budapest (Hungarian capital) to make other arrangements. From here, Shuster—the capital of a province under the Czechoslovak Republic—is very easy to reach, and without going through its own border, but through the capital of its enemy, Hungary.

An excellent eastward highway can take you to Ke Pa in five hours, and then take a local train to Beilegesi-Sa. There, it was originally guaranteed that you could get a bus to Shuster. But there wasn't one, so I consulted with the police, got a special pass for my driver, and drove to the border. In any case, I had to maintain a fair stance on Shuster. There, there are state-owned buses connecting to Slovenia; the latter being more common.

These recently ceded border cities still bear the scars of the urgent transfer of their nationality. The walls and shop fronts have been damaged, and all Czech company names and street names have been torn off and replaced with Hungarian names.

The temporary border (in Budapest, the border demarcation committee is still working on dividing the last line) includes two checkpoints, each with a four-wheeled truck parked in the middle of the street, as if it were a necessary gateway for entry and exit. Here, there are sentries wearing rifles, bayonets, and binoculars, guarding the roads and open spaces.

The Mud and Thatch of Rural Towns

Shuster itself is cleverly nestled beneath a small hill with many historical sites. This is a simple rural town, deeply mired in mud, and in my opinion, it looks just like Tirana, Angola twelve years ago. But in Angola, the buildings are solid and durable - here, the buildings of the new government are made of wood." "Why wood?" I asked. "Because there is a lot of wood," they said, adding, "In the old capital of Tsao Luote, we used stone to build. Here, it might be better to use wood."

Carpatho-Ukraine openly mourns the loss of its territory there, especially Utsho-Trot and Hei Kai-Si, where the Czech government squandered a lot of money on public buildings and schools before the Munich Conference. When I presented my pass, there was a stamp from Utsho-Trot affixed to it. The inspector painfully tore off "Utsho-Trot" and wrote "Shuster." On the other hand, Hungary is still dissatisfied, and there is a radio broadcast every night, "We will recover all the lost territory."

There are two hotels in Shuster, the Central and the Korona. The former is owned by a Jew, and the latter is under the rule of the "Sic" (Ukrainian Nazis). In the Central Hotel, we can still see Czech officials, merchants, Jews, and ordinary people. This can be called old-fashioned and legitimate. There are many newspapers, and what caught my attention was how anxiously the Jews surrounded "Volkskeji, Pi Peituo" (newspaper name) when the fresh newspapers arrived. A photo of President Volosin Father is hung there, and a photo of former Czech President Mai Yinlike is also hung in the Central Hotel.

The Simple Family of the President

But the Korona Hotel is the center of Shuster's active life, its guards, its reporters, and its gray-blue "Sic" uniforms. There is no photo of Mai Yinlike here, and a photo of Kono Huilai (a famous leader of the Ukrainian revolutionary movement) hangs in the management office. The sound of uniform heel-clicking can often be heard in the Korona Hotel. "Hey!"—raising a hand is the common greeting. In stark contrast to the Nazi atmosphere is the family of President Volosin Father. Apart from the local-style furniture, his residence can be said to be a comfortable residence for a presiding elder of the Methodist Church. In the living room are images of the Virgin Mary and the Heavenly Father, next to a portrait of his deceased wife, because Father Volosin belongs to the United Church, so pastors can also marry. The President's appearance and clothing are also completely like that of a presiding elder. His heart is open, and he is kind to people. He vehemently rejects any anti-Semitic sentiments. In fact, 80% of Carpatho-Ukraine's economic life is in the hands of Jews, who account for about 12% of the total population. They are completely loyal to the country.

Subsequently, the Chief Secretary convened a meeting of the Finance Committee, which approved an additional expenditure budget of $414,145 for this year. (The details of important deficits have been reported).

Military Contribution Set at Six Million

In recent years, the British government has paid close attention to Hong Kong's defense, sparing no effort in military preparations. Therefore, the burden of military expenses has also increased year by year. As for Hong Kong's annual contribution to the British government's military expenses, the original provision was 20% of the Hong Kong government's annual tax revenue. In recent years, Hong Kong's defense has become increasingly fortified, and expenses have also increased compared to the past. Now, following the instructions of the British Colonial Office, the annual military contribution is no longer based on the amount of tax revenue, but is fixed at six million dollars to cover the fixed amount of military expenses. As for the increase in this fixed amount of military expenses, during yesterday's Legislative Council meeting, a letter from Colonial Secretary Malcolm MacDonald to the Governor of Hong Kong, a letter from Mr. Lambert of the War Office to the Colonial Office, and a statement of military expenses were released. According to these documents, the British government spent a total of £1,551,508 on Hong Kong's military expenses last year, while Hong Kong only contributed £346,443. Therefore, the amount subsidized by the British government to Hong Kong reached £1,209,065. Furthermore, the aforementioned military expenses only take into account the army; the maintenance costs of the China Fleet and the British Royal Air Force have not yet been included. The figures for Hong Kong's military expenditure in each department are listed below: Military salaries: £373,304; food expenses: £39,792; educational construction: £5,677; military barracks and relocation: £48,386; land transportation costs: £151,012; land transportation costs: £169,934; uniforms: £40,639; ordinary food storage: £32,347; wartime food storage: £52,144; various projects: £331,908; active troops of all levels: £79,383; British troops: £101,999; reserve forces: £125,083; totaling £1,551,508. It is noted that in 1936-1937, the total military expenditure of Hong Kong was £1,551,508, while Hong Kong only contributed £337,020.

### Amidst the Rice Shortage in Guangdong, Fellow Townsmen from Various Districts in Hong Kong Are Busy with Relief Efforts; Chambers of Commerce Allocate Funds to Expedite Sales at Fair Prices; The Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce Will Ship Rice to the Mainland

Regarding the rice shortage in Guangdong, the Central Government, in consideration of the people's food supply, has approved the tax-free import of 1.2 million metric tons of foreign rice, of which 300,000 metric tons are designated for military rations, 700,000 metric tons for Chaozhou and Shantou, and 200,000 metric tons for Jiangmen, as reported in the newspapers. After this news was released, rice merchants in Hong Kong were delighted and prepared to ship the rice to the mainland for sale. For this reason, the reporter visited various fellow townsmen associations to investigate the latest developments. The details are recorded as follows:

Heshan Sells Rice at Eight Jin Per Dollar

According to Mr. Hou Shounan, Chairman of the Heshan Chamber of Commerce, after receiving news of the tax-free foreign rice, the Heshan Chamber of Commerce immediately convened consultations with fellow townsmen who were responsible for raising funds. They all agreed that the current price of white rice in Heshan was only five liang and four qian per dollar, the situation was serious, and the poor were suffering. Shipping rice for relief was the most pressing plan. Now that the Central Government has approved 200,000 metric tons of tax-free foreign rice for Jiangmen, for the sake of rapid relief, it has been decided that the Heshan Chamber of Commerce will allocate HK$8,000, and another wealthy businessman will provide HK$8,000, for a total of HK$16,000, to purchase rice and conduct sales at fair prices back in Heshan. They have already begun purchasing and shipping, and it has been decided that the foreign rice shipped back will be sold at eight jin per dollar.

Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegrams to Inquire

Since hearing that 700,000 metric tons of tax-free foreign rice had been approved for Chaozhou and Shantou, fellow townsmen from Chaozhou in Hong Kong have been eager to purchase large quantities of foreign rice and ship it back for relief. However, the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce believed that although there was news of tax-free foreign rice, the Central Government had not yet issued a clear order. Yesterday, they sent a telegram to Shantou to inquire about the truth. It was reported that the Shantou Chamber of Commerce had received a telegram from Mr. Chen Huanzhang, Chairman of the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce, from Qujiang, reporting that the approval of tax-free foreign rice had been verified. Once a reply is received, they will immediately begin shipping large quantities of rice back to various places in Chaozhou and Shantou to relieve the people's suffering.

Fellow Townsmen from Various Districts Donate Funds

After the Siyi Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to request tax exemption for foreign rice, news emerged that they had sent people back to their counties to sell rice at fair prices. Yesterday, the person in charge of the Taishan Chamber of Commerce told the reporter that wealthy businessmen from Taishan in Hong Kong were now holding consultations, donating funds, and combining the funds remitted back to various counties by fellow townsmen overseas to purchase large quantities of foreign rice and conduct sales at fair prices back in their counties.

The Zhongshan Grain Committee Comes to Hong Kong Again

Mr. Zhang Huichang, Chairman of the Zhongshan Wartime Grain Committee, again sent committee members Mr. Li Delian and Mr. Huang Jinzao to Hong Kong on the 23rd to investigate the prices of foreign rice in Hong Kong in order to purchase it and discuss fair-price sales with fellow townsmen from Zhongshan in Hong Kong. The Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce decided to allocate $40,000 to conduct sales at fair prices back in Zhongshan. The representatives visited Director Gu of the Finance Department to personally present the situation of the rice shortage. The representatives returned to Zhongshan on the same day.

### Equipment at Kai Tak Airport Is Not Yet Complete; Aircraft Often Encounter Difficulties When Landing

Yesterday afternoon, a French Airlines aircraft flew from Hanoi to Hong Kong. Due to the impact of heavy fog en route, it arrived later than scheduled. According to the pilot, Mr. Tousa, the reason for the delay was due to the weather and the inadequate lighting facilities at Kai Tak Airport, which made flying extremely difficult. When approaching Hong Kong, the aircraft was forced to fly as low as 300 feet above sea level, which was the minimum altitude, so the arrival time was slightly delayed. After the aircraft arrived, the pilot and the French Airlines authorities discussed the matter with Mr. Morse, the manager of Kai Tak Airport, for half an hour. Improvements are expected in the future. It is noted that the inadequate lighting facilities at Kai Tak Airport have made it difficult for mail planes on various routes to land in Hong Kong. When the Pan American Clipper first arrived in Hong Kong, it took half an hour to land. Two weeks ago, an Imperial Airways aircraft mistakenly flew to Bias Bay. The Kai Tak Airport authorities have not yet commented on this matter.

### To Prevent the Dumping of Raw Materials from Non-Western Countries, The Federation of Hong Kong Industries Carefully Issues Certificates of Origin; Implement Registration of Incoming and Outgoing Raw Materials and Products

Decides to Organize a Delegation to Visit Macau

The Federation of Hong Kong Industries held its 14th council meeting yesterday afternoon at 5 PM. Attendees included Mr. Yip Lan-chuen, Mr. Chan Lui-sheung, Mr. Hui Lap-sam, and more than ten others. Mr. Yip Lan-chuen was the chairman, and Mr. Hon Sui-hin was the secretary. After reporting on the previous meeting's resolutions, they began to discuss the agenda items. (1) Officials and gentry in Macau had previously sent a letter to the Hong Kong Manufacturers' Federation, inviting them to organize a delegation to visit Macau in order to provide guidance and improvements in promoting local goods. This issue was brought up for discussion at yesterday's meeting. As a result, it was decided to start organizing the delegation, and Mr. Hon Sui-hin, the General Affairs Secretary, was immediately appointed to go to Macau to discuss all matters. (2) Due to the recent large-scale shipping of raw materials from non-Western countries to Hong Kong for sale, the association had temporarily suspended the issuance of certificates of origin in order to prevent this. Regarding this issue, it was brought up for discussion again yesterday. It was decided to implement registration of incoming and outgoing raw materials and products. The quantity of raw materials and products must match before a certificate of origin is issued. The meeting then approved the membership applications of the Paul Yuon Zee Factory, the Ma Bo Shan Company, the Wah Sang Factory, the Kin Man Company Manufacturing Factory, and the United Rice Noodle Factory.

### The Wealthy Do Not Know the Sorrow of National Subjugation! Slow Progress in the Sale of Bonds in Hong Kong; Only Seven Million Yuan in Patriotic Donations Sent Since the War of Resistance, Not Enough to Meet the Quota; Middle and Lower-Class Overseas Chinese Have Enthusiastically Fulfilled Their Responsibilities, But the Wealthy Are Still Reluctant to Contribute

At the beginning of the War of Resistance, in order to concentrate financial and material resources to cope with the Japanese invasion, the financial authorities issued five hundred million yuan of National Salvation Bonds, which were distributed to various places in China and overseas Chinese communities for sale. By the summer of last year, most places in China and overseas had raised enough money and completed the sale, and the Ministry of Finance had officially announced the payment of interest. Hong Kong's quota was originally set at ten million, but it has been more than ten months since the fundraising began, and it has not yet reached the quota. The slow progress is unexpected. The reporter investigated the recent bond sales achievements and future fundraising plans with the Hong Kong fundraising branch yesterday. The details are as follows:

Slow Bond Sales, Not Enough to Meet the Quota

The National Salvation Bonds began to be sold in Hong Kong in October 1938. The fundraising branch promoted the fundraising work. Under the leadership of Chief Committee Member Sir Chau To-shan, the entire Hong Kong overseas Chinese community enthusiastically purchased the bonds. The middle and lower-class overseas Chinese were particularly enthusiastic. At that time, the bond sales progressed very quickly, with an average of hundreds of thousands of yuan per month. In terms of the economic strength of the Hong Kong overseas Chinese community, the ten million yuan in bonds could have been sold out in an instant. However, most of the wealthy in Hong Kong have not taken on their own responsibilities, relying only on the middle and lower-class overseas Chinese to do their best, which has led to a gradual slowdown in bond sales. From the beginning of fundraising to the present, the total amount raised is more than seven million (this number includes various patriotic donations before the issuance of the bonds). The fundraising achievement was best in the first phase. By the end of 1938, in just three months, it had reached more than four million. From January to the end of 1939, only two million seven hundred thousand yuan was raised in one year, which was much slower compared to the progress at the beginning of the issuance.

The Wealthy in Hong Kong Do Not Contribute Much

The only reason for the slow progress in bond sales is that the wealthy are unwilling to contribute more money. It is known that there are countless wealthy people in Hong Kong who have assets of millions or tens of millions. If these people could act according to their own conscience and fulfill their personal obligations to the country, allocating one-tenth of their assets to purchase bonds, then the ten million yuan in bonds could be sold out in an instant. However, the reality is not so. The reporter has carefully examined the list of bond purchasers and found that the amount purchased by each wealthy person is surprisingly small. That is, the past seven million yuan achievement was mostly concentrated from the efforts of the majority of the working class and lower-class overseas Chinese. As for long-term bond purchases, only the working class is working hard. The wealthy purchase bonds in one lump sum and then consider their responsibilities fulfilled. In terms of the actual situation, it is truly heartbreaking. Based on the current seven million yuan achievement in bond sales, and calculating the two million seven hundred thousand yuan sold in the past year, it will take another year to reach the original quota of two million yuan in bonds.

Central Government Sends Personnel to Hong Kong to Assist in Fundraising

The reporter received news yesterday that the central financial authorities recently sent personnel to Hong Kong to assist in fundraising. The reporter specially visited Mr. Chau To-shan, the chief committee member of the branch, and asked about the future fundraising plan. Director Chau replied that he had not received news about the central government sending personnel to Hong Kong to urge fundraising. Regarding the future plan, Director Chau expressed his opinion, saying that the purchase of National Salvation Bonds is a voluntary matter. The rapid progress of bond sales in the past was due to the automatic purchase by enthusiastic overseas Chinese. The long-term bond purchases by various organizations or individuals are also based on their personal enthusiasm. Although the branch had various planned activities in the past, such as door-to-door fundraising, they could not be realized due to environmental reasons.

Chau To-shan Encourages Fellow Townsmen to Work Hard

Therefore, the only way to promote fundraising and make the bond sales achievement progress rapidly is for fellow townsmen to voluntarily purchase the bonds. Currently, there are many industrial and commercial organizations and individuals in Hong Kong who purchase bonds on a monthly basis, amounting to about $150,000 per month. It is hoped that all Hong Kong overseas Chinese will emulate this spirit of long-term struggle and work together. In particular, it is hoped that the wealthy will remember the preciousness of the country and the importance of current responsibilities, and generously contribute their wealth. Then it will not be difficult to raise the ten million yuan in an instant. The reporter further inquired about the fundraising progress of the National Bonds and National Defense Bonds. It was answered that the National Bonds are issued directly by the bank, and the branch does not need to fundraise. The branch was only commissioned by the authorities to sell them on behalf of the bank. As for the National Defense Bonds, the branch also promoted them, but the achievement was less than ten thousand yuan. In the future, when the National Salvation Bonds reach their quota, a large-scale fundraising campaign will be launched.

### The Flying Hotel Officially Opens; Expected to Arrive in Hong Kong on Sunday

The Pan American Boeing-type giant plane, nicknamed the "Flying Hotel," after flying to Hong Kong on the 3rd of this month, was scheduled to officially start its regular flights on the 13th, carrying passengers from the east. However, due to the impact of the weather, the flight was postponed. Originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong today, yesterday, according to company news, the plane has flown out of San Francisco with a large number of mails and passengers. Due to bad weather en route, it has been delayed and will not arrive at Kai Tak Airport until Sunday. It will stay overnight and then return to the United States the next day.

### Smuggling Is Rampant; The Smuggling of Illicit Liquor from Sai Kung and Other Places in the New Territories to Hong Kong Is Increasing Daily; The Customs and Excise Department Sends More Police Detectives to Intercept Along the Way

The sale and manufacture of liquor in Hong Kong must be licensed by the Customs and Excise Department and pay the prescribed tax amount before business can be conducted. Otherwise, whether selling or manufacturing, once discovered, it will be punished for tax evasion. Smuggling and private sales are strictly prohibited. However, due to the large amount of liquor tax collected, secretly manufacturing and selling untaxed illicit liquor can often yield huge profits, leading some cunning people, despite knowing that they are violating the law, to secretly manufacture liquor and sell it secretly in order to make money. This kind of illicit liquor manufacturing is mostly carried out in rural villages in Sai Kung and the New Territories. After manufacturing the illicit liquor, they secretly smuggle it to Hong Kong and sell it to liquor stores or residents. Because its price is cheaper than taxed liquor, many who are greedy for profit are happy to buy it. As a result, the number of smugglers is increasing daily. Recently, hundreds of people smuggle illicit liquor from Sai Kung to Hong Kong every day, all taking the secluded mountain route along Kowloon City and Ngau Chi Wan. Although they travel in groups, carrying the goods on their shoulders and backs, and secretly enter the country, it is rarely known to outsiders. After smuggling the liquor to Kowloon City, they secretly hide it in a fixed place, and then carry it separately to sell it in Hong Kong and across the sea. It is now known that the Customs and Excise Department has heard about the smuggling of illicit liquor by criminals and has decided to send many detectives to patrol the key points along the mountains around Kowloon, secretly investigating and arresting the smugglers halfway in order to bring them to justice and prevent smuggling and maintain tax revenue.

### Yesterday, Xu Shiying Represented the Central Government in the Rain

To Comfort the Isolated Soldiers, He Allocated 3,000 Yuan for the Daily Needs of the Heroes

Mr. Xu Shiying, acting chairman of the Central Relief Committee, visited the soldiers in the camp at Ma Tau Chung in the rain yesterday afternoon at around 2 PM, accompanied by Mr. Dai Entuan, a medical officer from the Hong Kong Health Department, and Mr. Huang Yimei, a staff member of the Central Relief Committee. He gave an address, stating: "I am very pleased to see you all today, but I am also very saddened. I have wanted to visit for a long time, but I have been too busy to realize it. Today, I am here as the acting chairman of the Relief Committee, representing the Central Government, to express our deep concern. You are living here, unable to go out and contribute, and of course you are in pain. But I hope you will be patient, cultivate your mind and body, and serve the country and society again after the victory of the War of Resistance. You have already sweated and bled for the country. Living here, you are being well treated by the Hong Kong government. I am deeply grateful and should be disciplined. The people of the world respect you, just like the soldiers in Shanghai. On behalf of the Central Government, I wish you health and progress in your studies." He immediately agreed to allocate 3,000 yuan for the daily needs of the soldiers. At present, the camp houses 770 people, and another 11 are sick and are being treated. At 4:30 PM, Mr. Xu also visited the Ma Tau Chung Civilian Camp, which is led and managed by Mr. Situ Yongjue, the Director of Health, and houses 1,064 elderly, weak, and disabled people. The food, accommodation, education, and care are all excellent. It is personally managed by Mrs. Barent, a British expatriate, with the assistance of Mr. Hall and Miss Lin. Mr. Xu praised the camp for its excellent management and for being a model for all refugee camps in Hong Kong. He returned at 5:30 PM.

### Are Those Who Profit from National Crisis Feeling at Ease? A Complaint from a Patriotic Worker Regarding the "Salary Deduction for Bond Purchase" Incident

— Hong

"Public bonds, public bonds, purchased for the long term; ten percent collected, seven-seven split. The four big bosses, completely lost their conscience! Switching the dragon for the phoenix, provincial defense bonds..."

If you go to the workshop or break room of ×××× Company, as long as there are a few workers there, you will see them angrily talking to each other. Each of them will be singing the above "counting rhymes"-like doggerel. One morning, it suddenly appeared in various places in the factory, written with pencil on scrap paper, in slanting and crooked handwriting. In less than a few minutes, this quite interesting ballad, recited in colloquial Cantonese, spread throughout the factory, and everyone could recite it fluently. Because of this incident, the company fired a worker, supposedly because they recognized his handwriting and said he was the one who wrote the poem.

"There is absolutely no reason for you to fire me like this. What evidence do you have that I wrote those words? I really didn't write them!..." the fired worker argued laboriously.

"Forget it!" the manager said with a sneer. "Take off your uniform and number plate, and get out!"

So, the worker, who had only been working for a little over a month, was forced to take off his uniform, return his number plate, and became unemployed from then on. The manager spoke loudly, discussing who was hateful and who should be fired, deliberately making the workers hear these voices.

"Come to collect your bond certificates and leftover change before next Monday!"

The cold notice was posted, and the intimidated people gradually submitted. They hesitantly and helplessly received several broken and old bond certificates from the Ministry of Finance, mixed with some provincial defense bond certificates, and a jumble of old bond certificates with unordered serial numbers. In addition, some leftover change was returned, saying it was what was left over from the purchase.

"Sir! Look! Is there any justice in this?" A worker found someone and poured out their suppressed feelings: "Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War not long ago, the company told us that from now on, we would only receive ninety-five percent of our wages, and the remaining five percent would be deducted by the company to buy national defense bonds. At the time, we thought that it was the responsibility of every citizen during the war to contribute money and effort. Although we are laborers who toil all year round and can hardly get enough to eat, since we are in the rear, we should tighten our belts and squeeze out some money to offer to the country. Since the company is so enthusiastic, we naturally all agreed. In this way, the company has been deducting five percent of our wages every month, and it has been seventeen months now, deducting a total of more than sixteen thousand Hong Kong dollars. Among our seven hundred or so workers, the least amount deducted from each of us is seven or eight dimes per month. We workers have, after all, sacrificed a lot of our blood and sweat for the country."

"However, there is one thing that we cannot but ask about. Our wages have been deducted for seventeen months, and for seventeen months, we have not seen a single receipt, nor have we seen a published number. We don't understand at all how much money we have contributed, how much money the company has bought for us, and what kind of bond certificates they have bought. When we go to the manager, the manager only reprimands you, saying that these things are none of your business."

"Many people are spreading rumors, saying that the company does not buy national defense bonds, but buys provincial defense bonds. They say that these bond certificates are not bought from the counter. This is what the doggerel says, 'Switching the dragon for the phoenix, provincial defense bonds,' 'ten percent collected, seven-seven split.' Those bond certificates don't have consecutive numbers, they are disordered, and they are old. At the same time, we donated Hong Kong dollars, but we bought national currency, and the amount is very different. These facts cannot but make us suspicious. We also sent representatives to the ×× branch to inquire, but the gentlemen at the branch refused to answer. Therefore, we cannot but directly negotiate with the company. We once had all the workers in seven work sections (Transportation Department, Engineering Department, etc.) sign a petition, demanding that the company publish the numbers and publish the bond certificate numbers. However, the company ignored our request. They only issued a notice saying that the remaining money—the leftover change—would be kept in the company's finance department as a deposit for the workers, and the public bonds would no longer be purchased."

"This is simply taking the opportunity to exploit us! It is not only deceiving us workers, but also deceiving the government. No one is willing to have our donations buried like this. Later, we sent representatives to negotiate with them again. As a result, they agreed to publish the numbers and agreed to return the change to the workers to dispose of themselves. However, another twenty days have passed now, and the numbers have not been published. Instead, those who are more knowledgeable and have a sense of justice among the workers have been fired. Now, they are also preparing to fire those representatives who have negotiated with the company. Many workers are being threatened and oppressed and dare not speak out. They quietly received the certificates and change from the finance department, not even daring to ask how much money they have contributed and how much money they should get back!"

"Now, the company is also planning to buy back the previously distributed bond certificates from the workers at a low price. I heard that they want to take them to another factory for other purposes."

"Sir, people often say that Hong Kong people are slow and not enthusiastic about buying bonds. In fact, poor people like us are very enthusiastic. Like that famous hawker charity sale, like our regular 'ninety-five percent salary deduction,' almost every factory is the same. Who says we are not enthusiastic?? It's just that some conscienceless people have buried our enthusiasm!"

"However, today we were deceived. We will not be fooled again a second time. We have more than seven hundred workers. We have more than seven hundred enthusiastic patriotic people. We will not be buried forever. I think the people in society will also sympathize with us. You must know that we are not conducting any labor-management disputes now, but only an act of justice against profiting from the national crisis, against deceiving the government, and deceiving the nation and the country...!"

This enthusiastic worker finally believed so firmly.

Believe that such righteous acts will unfold among all people with a sense of justice. No one can stand by and watch. This is entirely for the benefit of the country and the nation.

### My Counteroffensive Military Situation Takes a Sharp Turn for the Worse. Guangdong × Anxiously Holds Emergency Meeting to Cope. However, the Navy, Army, and Air Force Disagree, and the Meeting Yields No Results. × Military Is Not Confident and Decides to Expand Political Promotion

[Special Dispatch from Beijiang] The southward invading × army, due to lack of troops, has been besieged and contained by our army for five months, and has become exhausted. Our military authorities, in order to eliminate the × bandits and recover lost territory, have been actively carrying out military counteroffensives for a long time, and have already made full deployments, presenting a sharp turn for the worse. Our frontline army teams have been ordered to advance towards × step by step. According to military news, Guangzhou × chieftain Ando, ​​recently, because our various armies have already launched activities and a major battle is imminent, is extremely anxious. In addition to actively increasing troops at various points and lines, building more fortifications, and opening up and repairing various road traffic to facilitate advancement, retreat, and support, he also convened navy, army, and air force officers and × chiefs from the east, west, north, and various lines in Guangzhou last week to return to the province and hold an emergency military meeting to discuss offensive and defensive response measures. It is reported that the × chiefs of Sanshui, Zhongyuan, Jiujiang, Zhishong, Wancheng, Fangchuan, Panyu, Yoshida Lin, and the × brigade and regimental commanders of Foshan, Fujita, Adachi, Katano, Fukuda, Heta, etc., were all summoned to participate. It is heard that the meeting did not result in any concrete consultation. The biggest reason is that they are limited by the exhaustion of troops and cannot mobilize a large number of troops. Moreover, the southward invading × navy and army have unresolved cracks due to disputes over meritorious service. At the time of the meeting, their opinions diverged. They could not agree on whether to defend to the death and wait for reinforcements or to continue the invasion. Judging from the recent trends of the × army at various points and lines, it can be seen that they are still wandering in a fork in the road. However, what is most noteworthy is that before they are confident in military affairs, they have decided to expand the promotion of appeasement politics in the occupied areas and actively organize puppets to use seductive methods to confuse our people in order to eliminate the national and ethnic ideology of our people. At the same time, they have also transported a large number of toxic gases to be stockpiled on the front lines of the east, west, and north of the Yangtze River, with the intention of using them at any time. Their intentions are extremely sinister. Our military authorities have ordered their subordinates to pay close attention.

### Guangdong East, West, and North of Yangtze River. We Intensify Preparations for Counteroffensive. Our Mechanized Team Reinforces the Northern Route. Chen's Troops Attack Sanhua × Camp and Achieve Victory

[Special Dispatch from Beijiang] Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwest Military Council, after convening a meeting of senior generals in the South China Theater in Guilin a few days ago, has a complete military plan for defense and annihilation of ×. In addition to sending a certain military officer to be solely responsible for the national defense of southern Guangdong to prevent × troops from advancing, he ordered Zhang Fakui, Commander of the Fourth War Zone, to intensify deployments for the defense against × and counteroffensives in the east, west, and north of the Yangtze River and implement them according to plan to crush ×'s conspiracy to open up the Guangdong Road. It is now reported that Commander Zhang, in order to closely monitor the actions of the × army and wait for an opportunity to launch a counteroffensive, dispatched a new-style mechanized unit south yesterday to assist the Twelfth Army Group to fortify the line of Zengcheng, Conghua, and Huaxian to prevent × from advancing north. He also ordered a certain elite unit to reinforce the area of ​​Guotai, Chibaini, and so on, so that the northwest routes would take close contact and strictly control ×. It is also reported that the × army on the Conghua line has been constantly harassing various villages in recent days. However, our defending troops and guerrilla teams have also launched attacks on × repeatedly. On the evening of the 17th of this month, our attacking troops from Chen's division launched a surprise attack on the Sanhua × camp near Xin Street. At one o'clock in the deep night, they secretly arrived at the destination and immediately used machine guns to densely strafe the × camp. The × soldiers, hearing the sound, got up to resist. Our soldiers bravely waved their weapons and charged into the × camp. After about half an hour of fierce fighting, × could not hold on and was wiped out, killing more than a dozen people. The remaining × fled in a panic, abandoning more than twenty long and short guns and one light machine gun. Our army returned to its original defense after completing its mission. The next morning (the 18th), × divided its forces and sent infantry to search and seize villages in the nearby area to vent its anger.

### Guangdong Provincial Government Convenes a Provincial Military Training Conference to Rectify Social Training and Promote Conscription. Circular Ordering Social Training Personnel to Attend

[Special Dispatch from Shaoguan] The Guangdong provincial authorities, in order to implement social military training by the central government, aim to mobilize the people to defend themselves, promote national conscription, and enrich the military strength for the war of resistance. It is especially important for the effective use of self-defense teams. Commander Zhang of the Fourth War Zone convened a symposium of responsible personnel from the Guangdong Party, government, and military to discuss the organizational training plan for social training and self-defense groups. Regarding the team aspect, the provincial government convened a provincial military conference in February, gathering guerrilla commanders from various districts to implement the original decision plan. At this moment, regarding the improvement of social training work, the provincial government has decided to quickly rectify it and hold a provincial military training conference at the end of this month, issuing a circular ordering the chief and deputy captains of social training in each county to attend on schedule and report on the social training work in their respective counties as a basis for improvement. The improvement plan is based on the three principles set by Commander Zhang: (1) How to integrate the organization and training of self-defense teams with social training? (2) How to integrate the organization and training of self-defense teams with the promotion of conscription? (3) How can the organization and training of social training and self-defense teams establish a foundation for guerrilla warfare? We must strive to give full play to the functions of social training, strengthen the people's armed forces, enrich the source of soldiers, and shoulder the mission of a protracted war of resistance.

### Eastern River Defense Is Getting Stronger Day by Day. Liang Zhu Talks About ×'s Inability to Invade the East. × Planes Harass Various Places in the Eastern River in the Rain for Days. According to Dongguan, the Number of × Troops in Shilong Has Been Decreasing Day by Day

[Special Dispatch from Huiyang] The × army in the Eastern River, because of its weak strength, is afraid of our attack. It often makes a show of force and transfers troops frequently to cover up and confuse our vision. Those who do not understand the tricks of the × army mistakenly think that there is something going on when the × army increases troops in one place. Therefore, the Eastern River changes due to the frequent increase and decrease of the × army, and the situation is also tense and relaxed. The following is a record of the latest information obtained in the Eastern River.

Liang Zhu Talks About ×'s Inability to Invade the East

The × army in the Eastern River has been moving frequently recently, so the atmosphere seems tense again. The reporter met Liang Zhu, deputy commander of the Third District Guerrilla Column, yesterday and asked him about everything. According to him, it has recently been rumored from other places that × has increased troops from Humen, and the strongholds in Shilong and Dongguan have plans to invade Huiyang. However, our headquarters has recently obtained information from various sources that × is unable to invade the east due to its weak forces, which are not enough to allocate for defense. Therefore, × often transfers troops back and forth at various points and lines. Judging from the current situation of ×, it is judged that × will definitely not be able to invade the east. We have deployed strong forces and strictly defended all lines in the lower reaches of the Eastern River. All the highways of Bozeng, Huizhang, Huidan, and Huifu have been destroyed. The headquarters has also sent its advisors, Fang Guwen, and Deputy Officer Jiang, to various places in Huibo to inspect and instruct the branch teams. Therefore, the situation in the Eastern River is currently very stable. According to another report, the × army in the Eastern River, except for slightly increased troops in Zhucun and Xiancun, Zengcheng, the number of × troops in Wancheng, Shilong, Taiping, and Shitan has decreased compared to last week.

Teams Protect Commercial Transportation

According to a report from Shenzhen, the scattered soldiers, bandits, and robbers in Lilang, Buji, Guanlan, and Pinghu in Dongbao counties looted everywhere a month ago, causing huge losses to villagers and merchants traveling to and from the area. Now, the Fourth District Guerrilla Headquarters believes that this area is the thoroughfare of transportation in Dongbao. Merchants and civilians from Dongguan, Boluo, Baoan, and other places must pass through this area every day along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway to go to the British territory to buy and sell goods. In order to protect transportation and maintain wartime security, the headquarters specially ordered the Luokun unit of the ×th Brigade Guerrilla Team to go to Zhangmutou, Lincun, Tangtou, Buji, and Li Peng to defend and be responsible for the security along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and protect travelers. As a result, the local bandits and scattered soldiers have disappeared, so many villagers in the lower reaches of the Eastern River have been traveling back and forth along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway through Baoan to the British territory to transport goods in recent days, and no robberies have occurred.

× Planes Harass Various Places for Days

It has been dark for days, and the weather is often cloudy and rainy. On the 21st and 22nd, batches of three or two × planes flew from the direction of Humen to reconnaissance in Dongbao and Huige. They flew low over Masi, Longjiao, Qishi, Qiaotou, Longgang, Shawan, and Tangxia, seeming to be reconnoitering. Also, two × warships were found cruising on the sea off Xixiang, Baoan County, on the afternoon of the 22nd, but there were no unusual movements. Around five o'clock, they sailed overseas. The situation in Dongshi is as usual, and the people are also very calm.

### × Invasion of Rongqi Is Impossible. Daliang Is Surrounded by Us. Rongqi is Our Advantageous Terrain. We Divide Our Troops Into Three Routes to Approach Daliang

[Special Dispatch from Rongqi] Since Daliang × was severely damaged by our counteroffensive, × knows that the strength of our team is not weak. On the 21st and 22nd, it continued to mobilize troops and increase guard posts. In Shatou, because it is facing our army across the river, it is afraid that we will cross the river and attack at night, so the number of × troops has increased even more. According to the intelligence of the ×th Detachment of the First Guerrilla Area, four small cannons and eight heavy machine guns have been added to Shatou, which shows how much it is on guard.

Shatou × Army Is Counterattacked by Us

In Rongqi, although it has been bombed by × planes, it will never affect the fighting will of our stationed troops. × also learned that our team in Zhongshan, led by Yuan, is the most effective in combat and that the one who attacked Bigian Street in Daliang was this unit. It even sent planes to Xiaolan for days to distribute leaflets, intending to seduce our soldiers and civilians to shake our military will. However, our team is increasing day by day, and its morale is extremely high, which cannot be instigated by ×'s poor skills. At this moment, the army in Rongqi is gathered, taking advantage of the advantageous terrain, it can attack and defend. × made three reconnaissance attempts on the 22nd, all of which were counterattacked by us with dynamic tactics. × cannot only invade Rongqi from Shatou, but also has the risk of being flanked at any time, and cannot take care of both ends.

Divide Troops into Three Routes to Approach Daliang

The reporter met Qu Renzhe, the chief staff officer of the Headquarters of Another Team, yesterday and inquired about the situation of × and us. According to him, in the battle of the counteroffensive against Daliang a few days ago, our headquarters was about to solve ×, but it failed due to the late arrival of a certain unit. However, our team is determined to recover Daliang. Each team is in close contact. Now, it has divided its troops into three routes, using its familiarity with the terrain to detour and approach the four parts of Daliang. The encirclement has been formed. The officers of each department have set off to command a major joint campaign, and they will not rest until they achieve their goals.

### Investigation Report from Qiong Overseas Chinese Federation: Severe Famine in Qiongya. Poor People Fill Their Stomachs with Bark and Grass Roots

The representative of the Qiong Overseas Chinese Federation in Hong Kong, who was previously sent back to Qiong to investigate the disaster situation, reported to the Federation on the disaster situation in Qiongya yesterday. The following is a summary:

Starving People Everywhere Peel Bark

I was ordered by the Federation a month ago to return to Qiong secretly. However, at that time, the ports of Hainan were blocked by ×, so I was forced to stay in Guangzhou Bay for more than ten days. Later, I risked taking a small fishing boat back to Qiong. After many hardships, I arrived in Jiaji. After Qiong was occupied by ×, overseas transportation was completely cut off. Therefore, all supplies that used to be provided by overseas have disappeared, especially food. Moreover, there was a crop failure in Hainan last year, and now the supply has been cut off again, so the rice shortage is very serious. Starving people peel bark and eat grass roots to fill their stomachs, which is almost everywhere. Therefore, it is urgent to find ways to transport rice imports for relief today. There are many refugees who have escaped from Guangzhou Bay. However, those who have escaped are all wealthy people who rent houses or live in hotels. Therefore, although there is a refugee camp in Guangzhou Bay, no one lives there. Therefore, there is no need to start relief efforts in Guangzhou. Those who urgently need relief are the people who have not escaped and are starving.

Many Want to Go to Nanyang but Lack Funds

Now, the refugees who have escaped from Guangzhou Bay have nothing to do and many want to go to Singapore and other places in Nanyang to make a living. However, the price of ship tickets to Nanyang has suddenly soared recently, and even third-class berths are as high as two or three hundred yuan. Many of those who want to go to Nanyang are discouraged because of this. I hope the Federation can find ways to subsidize or negotiate with shipping companies to lower the ticket price so that those who aspire to develop abroad will not be disappointed.

After receiving the report from the representative, the Federation has decided to convene a plenary meeting of Qiong Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong during the day to discuss relief matters.

### Special Shipping News

### Zhang Guoquan Talks About the Battle History of Li Bai. Enlisted in the Army Early and Made Achievements

Military and political personnel in Guangxi all know "Teacher Zhang." He is from Yangshuo and was the teacher of Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Huang Xuchu, Huang Shaoxiong, and others in their youth. Even now, they still call him "Teacher Zhang." Therefore, everyone also calls him "Teacher Zhang" instead of his name. Perhaps he is the only surviving teacher of the four of them. The writer did not want to miss the opportunity to visit him. Teacher Zhang's residence is on County Front Street, less than fifty steps away from the county government. It faces west and east and is a stone-clad house with two bays. It is obvious that it was built not long ago. A strong child handed me my name card. At first, I thought he was Teacher Zhang's grandson, but later I learned that he was his only beloved son. Before long, the servant brought tea and cigarettes. Then, "Teacher Zhang," wearing a gray silk wide robe and cloth shoes, came out of the building in the second courtyard to meet me. Although he is already in his fifties or sixties, he has not yet grown old. He looks at least ten years younger than his age. His steady pace and the firm handshake show that he had a military life in his youth. The writer first expressed his greetings and explained the purpose of the visit. Teacher Zhang graduated from the first class of the Baoding Xiehe Class, the predecessor of the Baoding Military Academy, at the end of the Xuantong Dynasty. The governor was Duan Qirui, and the supervisor was Qu Tongfeng. There were infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineering, and baggage departments. He graduated in two and a half years. After the second class of the Xiehe Class graduated, it was renamed Baoding Military Academy. During the Xuantong years, he graduated from the Japanese Military Academy and returned to China with Cai Songpo from Yunnan and Zhuang Yunkuan from Jiangsu. He founded a primary military school in Guilin, Guangxi. Li Bai and the two Huangs were the first students of this primary school. At that time, these "outstanding students" were all teenagers in their teens, but among the more than one hundred students, he felt that they were "naturally gifted" and "diligently studied." "It is not because they are now in high positions that I am talking about old age and flattering them," Teacher Zhang said. "De Lin and Jian Sheng are indeed clever and brave. In the early years of the Republic of China, I led troops, and De Lin was a company commander under me. Once, during a battle in Hunan, his cheek was pierced by a bullet. I told him to go down, but he insisted on supporting until the task was completed before leaving the battlefield. After he recovered from his injury, a battalion commander happened to be vacant, so I promoted him. Jian Sheng unfortunately broke his leg bone when he was suppressing bandits in southern Guizhou Province. Although he was sent to Guangdong for treatment and recovered, he still limps a little when he walks now. His decisiveness was already like this in his youth." He himself said that he was originally a proletarian. The new house he lives in now was built for him last year by these "classmates." He used to live in Hong Kong and often went to Guilin after returning to his hometown. He either stayed at the Li family or ate at the Bai family." He is truly a respectable teacher. On the evening of the day the writer visited him, Teacher Zhang actually stepped on the muddy village road to visit me at the Le Society. It was truly something I dared not bear. That night, he wore a leather hat and held a thin bamboo dry pipe with a copper head. He looked a little old, but he was in good spirits. He talked about many customs and local conditions of Yangshuo. It was already dark when he left. He smiled and said, "After you come to Yangshuo to play, you should pay us some taxes." I also smiled and said, "Let's say that then." He said, "Please write more articles in the newspaper to attract more tourists for the local people." I wanted to send him back, but he insisted on refusing, saying, "In my own home, I have to ask guests to lead the way." I had to give up. Zhang also inscribed the four characters "National Golden Voice" for this newspaper. Teacher Zhang's name is Guoquan, his style name is Zhenou, and he is currently a lieutenant general and military advisor in the Headquarters of the ×th Army. He often has suggestions on military planning for Li Bai, and many are adopted.

Movies and Drama

### After Bringing Five Hundred Dollars to Hollywood

With five hundred dollars, I arrived in Hollywood.

My mother started by taking out two hundred and fifty dollars. My aunt, Eloise, scraped together four hundred. Even Uncle Charles, usually known for his stinginess, surprisingly loosened his purse strings this time and gave a hundred dollars.

My family firmly believed the saying often seen in magazines: "If a woman wants to enter the film industry, she must have at least five hundred dollars on hand; otherwise, she doesn't need to come to Hollywood." We thought this sum could support me there for about four months. However, that was based on the living standards of our small town; in reality, it only lasted two and a half months.

I didn't waste a single unnecessary penny, except for the one dollar and fifty cents I spent going to Santa Anita to see the horse races. Also, I spent two dollars to buy a "von" (a type of bet) called Adam. Strangely enough, it came in first and won me eleven dollars and eighty cents. However, it rained that day at Santa Anita, and I had to buy a new hat (eight dollars), some throat lozenges (twenty-five cents), and cold medicine (fifty cents), and also get my hair done (seventy-five cents). After offsetting expenses, the actual expenditure was exactly one dollar and twenty cents.

My family considered this five hundred dollars the last investment in me. My grades in high school showed that if there wasn't a dedicated drama department in college, then I should just stay home and give up this ambition. At the same time, my appearance—my only tangible asset—was good enough to go to Hollywood. Another intangible asset was an unshakable belief in my heart: if I couldn't go to Hollywood, I'd rather die. Remember, this belief is the most important thing. Even if you have ten thousand dollars but lack this belief, I advise you not to come to Hollywood; it's not worth it.

That's how it was. Holding this belief in one hand and five hundred dollars in traveler's checks in the other, I came to this birthplace of stars. This five hundred dollars is the "hero" of my story. I want to tell you how it was spent.

I'm neither a contest winner nor a foreign talent specially invited by a company. No one in the film industry would welcome me. I followed others as I got off the train in Los Angeles. Carrying my large trunk and two small suitcases, I stepped onto that dirty, gloomy, noisy, and utterly terrible train station. I hailed a taxi, drove through the business district of Los Angeles, and finally stopped in front of the Actors' Apartments on La Brea Avenue. My family had already booked a room for me there (taxi fare: one dollar and fifty cents).

This apartment, architecturally speaking, was a very sophisticated Mediterranean-style building, but in nature, it was a Ziegfeld Follies dormitory. When I pushed the door open and went inside, I was sure I was in Hollywood. Many beautiful women inside turned their heads and glanced at me, with a hint of disdain, as if saying "country bumpkin," and then went back to their own affairs. Later I learned that they were all waiting for the phone to ring.

"...Comfortable and beautiful environment... spacious guest rooms... library and lounge with fireplaces... ping-pong room and candlelit dining room... every room has hot and cold water... free access to laundry room, kitchenette, sewing machine, typewriter, piano, radio, and telephone with direct lines to the studios... plentiful meals... assistance with job hunting..."

My single room cost thirteen dollars and fifty cents a week, with two meals provided daily. In this apartment, there were ninety-eight women who had come with the same goal as me. I could have shared a room with someone else for just eight dollars a week, but at that time, I thought my five hundred dollars was inexhaustible.

For the first week, besides a bit of homesickness and carefully observing everything around me, I didn't do anything. After a week, cleverly, I discovered the following:

First, my clothes, which were perfectly acceptable in my hometown of Henrysville, lacked three essential things here: trousers, the Mexican shoes everyone wore, and a heavy winter coat. Everyone returning from California said it was warm there and there was no need for a coat, but the evenings were unexpectedly and severely cold. No matter how beautiful a woman is, she can't stand shivering from the cold. Trousers were more practical; you could wear them anywhere. However, they had to be of high-quality material and well-tailored. A pair of trousers cost me fifteen dollars and ninety-five cents. Mexican shoes were four dollars and ninety-five cents. By a stroke of luck, I caught a big sale on a coat for twenty-nine dollars and fifty cents.

Second, Hollywood women value appearance more than a full stomach. They'd rather starve than neglect their makeup, which is, in reality, the only thing they can use to attract employers. Every week, I had to spend two dollars on beauty treatments. Initially, this expense made me hesitant and frustrated. Finally, my thrifty habits from my hometown succumbed to the environment.

Third, trying to get extra work in Hollywood without a car is simply impossible. Distances are often so far, and public transport is not very convenient. Besides, if you occasionally get a day's work fifteen miles away, how much profit can you make after paying for two taxi rides? Women in the apartment who owned cars often cleverly did a little business by giving others rides for a fee, but I didn't want to rely on others. I bought a car. In 1933, it was worth a full nine hundred dollars. Now, I bought it for one hundred and seventy-five dollars, with fifty dollars down and the rest in monthly installments of twenty dollars. It's a small, green-blue car with a removable top, and it looks decent enough. Parking at the apartment cost one dollar a day. Gasoline and oil cost about ten dollars a month. I started to get active.

The first place I went was the Actors' Guild at 7046 Hollywood Boulevard. There, a kind-faced clerk gave me a severe blow. He said that you can't request introductions to acting jobs unless you're a member, and to become a member, you have to have acted before or have the prospect of acting. This regulation is too harsh and unreasonable. However, for the sake of extra actors, people like me, or those who consider themselves geniuses, should indeed be prevented from intruding. Whether it's reasonable or not, my path was blocked. I had to join the guild to get acting jobs, but to join the guild, I had to have acted before. There was no way around it.

With less hope, I walked to the Central Casting Office on the other side of the boulevard. This time, the blow was even more severe. "Under no circumstances will we register any newcomers." Done. Clearly, I couldn't even be an extra.

Back on the street, I discovered that I had a flat tire. While waiting for it to be repaired (the repair cost was not fifty cents but one dollar, because it was cut by a piece of glass, which was more serious than a nail puncture), I thought that there were still several paths open to me:

1.  Go home.

2.  Visit acting agencies, agents, and public restaurants frequented by film industry people more often. Attend new film premieres. Wait at the film company gates, hoping to attract the attention of directors.

3.  Befriend an agent and have him introduce me.

4.  Do something shocking to attract world attention.

I gave up on options one and four and decided to try two and three. Because I lived not far from Paramount, I often lingered and waited. Finally—lucky me—I met an agent. He asked me questions very attentively and seemed very interested in me. He praised my beauty and enthusiastically handed me a business card, asking me to come to his office the next day.

### Overcoming Another Obstacle, Eastern's Hopes for Second Place are High, The Entire Team Defeated Scott 4-3 Through Hard Work

Li Si and Shi Wei laid the foundation... Deng Qin regretted missing the open goal

The Group A football league has entered an intense stage these past two weeks. The Eastern Association is vying for second place and yesterday afternoon they took on Scott at the Hong Kong stadium. Although the spring rain was continuous and the weather gloomy, the fans were still keen on the game, and it did not reduce the number of spectators. Although it was not packed, it was quite crowded. The Eastern athletes finally lived up to expectations, and in several close-quarters skirmishes, they finally completed their mission and defeated the stubborn Scott team, continuing to move towards the prospect of second place. The fans, filled with hope, were all very happy.

For Eastern's victory this time, if rewards were given, Li Si should be first. The three forwards

fulfilled their duties. Only Miao Huaguo and Xu Buyun, marching in the rain, were somewhat out of sorts. The fact that Scott's forwards were able to intercept and score three goals was purely due to the weakness of the inner defense. The Scott players fought extremely bravely. Although Heer was not seen on the front line, the three forwards cooperated well and put on a good show. They were also formidable, but their progress was slow.

Scott was determined to contend for second place for the foreign teams, and yesterday they played with a fairly complete lineup. Not long after the start of the match, they launched a fierce attack on Eastern. Crawford and Brown crossed the ball, attacking along the wing. Seeing this, Wei Quan rushed forward to block. Crawford then passed the ball to McDonald, but it was eventually cleared by Zhongtang. Within twenty minutes, the Eastern goal was almost surrounded by the enemy like a bucket. They lost the ball several times. Fortunately, Xianhan and several defenders tried their best to resist, so they were not defeated. Then, Eastern counterattacked. Chengtuo dribbled straight up and lofted the ball high. Yu Qiaxing missed the header, which turned forward and was blocked by Deng Qin. Soon, Chengtuo won the ball again and shot hard. Deng Qin dived to block, but the ball was still not far from the goal. Deqi hooked it in with his foot, but was blocked by the defenders. In the ensuing melee, Chengtuo found an opportunity and broke through Deng Qin's defense with a shot, opening the scoring. After a while, Deqi received a cross from Bingtu, dodged Fraser, and Deng Qin, seeing that things were not going well, rushed out. Deqi was quick-eyed and quickly raised his foot from the right corner, sending in another goal. Scott lost again and again and launched a fierce counterattack. Midfielder Barnafei managed to get the ball in the chaos and lobbed it over Wei Quan's defense. He shot very well from 20 yards, giving a goal back. Scott regained a city, and their morale rose sharply. Many dangers arose in front of the Eastern goal. Soon, Barnafei again received a cross from Crawford and scored another goal, tying the score at 2-2, and the first half was soon over.

Changing sides, Scott's siege became even more urgent. Eastern broke through several times, but to no avail. Finally, McDonald came alone and scored a goal. At this point, Scott turned defeat into victory. The domestic fans were extremely anxious. However, the Eastern team knew to encourage themselves. Seeing that they had lost several goals in a row, they were deeply afraid that the issue of second place would become a bubble. So they raised their arms and shouted, and the whole team worked hard. The five forwards attacked at once. With the greatest effort, Deqi crouched in front of the goal, taking advantage of Wei Quan's corner kick, and headed the ball into the net. With the score tied, the team's morale was restored, and everyone fought bravely, determined to win. The two sides fought fiercely for about 20 minutes. Eastern forced another corner kick, which was blocked by Fraser. The ball fell in front of Wei Quan, who crossed it again. Deqi rushed forward desperately, using the same trick again, shaking his head and sending the ball into the net, making the score 4-3, securing the final victory and returning.

### Birodo Chosen to Replenish the Football Team Going to the Philippines

(Our Paper Exclusive News) The Hong Kong international football team that is going to the Philippines has already been selected by the general management committee of 15 people. Later, naval players Kan Di and Lie Li claimed that they would be going to sea with the fleet and would not be able to accompany the team at that time, so the management committee selected Hou Chengtuo and Parker to replace them. However, Parker will be returning to England soon and has also given up his right to be selected. When the management committee met the other day, it was decided to select Birodo to fill the vacancy. It is heard that Birodo has agreed to go to the Philippines. (Eastern Wind)

### A Glorious Harvest for the Shanghai Chinese Football World: Lido Wins the Scott Cup, Defeating the Western Police 4-3 with a Wonderful Performance

(Shanghai News, 19th) The Lido football team, with an extremely wonderful performance and perfect cooperation, fought fiercely for 90 minutes yesterday and finally defeated the fierce Western Police 4-2 in the final to win back the Scott Cup, which the Chinese had been separated from for three years.

Yesterday was sunny and breezy, and the crowds numbered about 8,000, their cheers like thunder. After the game, the acting chairman of the Western Union, Mr. Bolicki, personally presented the Scott Cup, which had been held by the British Army Siem team last year, to Lido captain Li Yichen, and gave a congratulatory speech.

It is said that the Scott Cup has been held since 1902, and only in 1935 and 1936 did the East China team hold it for two consecutive years. The rest of the time, it has been held by Western teams. After it fell to the French Chamber of Commerce in 1937, it fell into the hands of the British Army Siem team last year. This season, Lido, with the qualifications of a Group C team, repeatedly defeated strong enemies to win the alliance, winning a lot of glory for the Chinese.

Fierce Battle Decides the Victory

Yesterday, the two sides were evenly matched and full of highlights. Lido's Xu Wenkui performed best and can be considered the number one contributor. Li Yichen also worked very hard. Cao and Zhang on the wings had good structures, especially Zhang Mingsheng's corner kicks, which were extremely accurate. Wang Kehou was inferior. The midfield line was not strong enough. Sun Jinshun, sitting in the back, repeatedly saved dangerous balls, with more merit than demerit. Zhang Linggen was still lacking. Goalkeeper Lu Zhongen still inevitably had some carelessness. Western Police goalkeeper Willie's performance was far above Zhongen's. His positioning was particularly good. The four goals he lost were really difficult to save. The center and fullbacks were out of sorts. The ball was often kicked backwards, and loopholes frequently appeared. The reason for the failure lies in this. The forward line was still active. The central forward shot fiercely. Right-winger Hootley had many wonderful moments. Left-winger Livingstone already felt old and weak. Tengdu's victory did not come easily.

Each Scored One Goal to Tie

The Western Police attacked first, with Whist and Hoot taking long shots. As soon as the deer received the ball, Wang Kehou dribbled into the territory and passed it to Cao Qiuting. Cao hooked to the middle, but Turner pulled his foot to save it. The ball flew backwards. Willie jumped up and held it, but did not make a big mistake. Lido launched a fierce attack on the enemy camp. The Western Police saved a corner kick, which was opened by Zhang Mingsheng. The angle was very good. Willie was not far away. Cao Qiuting caught up and hooked a shot, which went straight into the bottom of the net, opening the scoring. Only five minutes had passed since the start of the match. Jinshun committed a foul, and Treffi took two free kicks from 20 yards, but both went wide. Xu Wenkui got a pass from Zhang Mingsheng, but Wang Kehou could not stop him, and he missed a good opportunity. At ten minutes, Treffi attacked from the middle, lobbing to Hootley. Hoot hooked it in, and Greenburg tapped it in, the ball entering from the corner of the bottom, and the long-legged deer did not save it, so it became a 1-1 tie.

Xu and Wang Both Contributed

The Western Police's attack struck again. Hootley hooked a pass to Greenburg, who shot without waiting for the ball to stop, but it went over the crossbar. Lido advanced. Xu Wenkui passed to Li Yichen, who was blocked, and passed it back to Wenkui, who then passed it to Zhang Mingsheng. Zhang hooked it in, and Wang Kehou headed it out of bounds. The ball was kicked out from the Western Police's goal area. Treffi made a wonderful pass to Hootley, who missed the opportunity. Xu Wenkui got the ball and dribbled forward, showing his magical powers, lobbing the ball high. Turner panicked and kicked it into a corner kick, which was opened by Zhang Mingsheng. Turner headed it out, and Xu added another header, which was caught by Willie. Then Lido had another corner kick opportunity. Zhang Mingsheng repeated the same trick, passing it to Kui, who took a fierce header from 16 yards, making a great contribution. Unexpectedly, only two minutes later, Zhang Mingsheng hooked it in, and Wang Kehou rushed into the net with the ball, giving Lido a 3-1 lead.

The Western Police Were at a Disadvantage

The Western Police counterattacked, Peter shot hard, and Zhongen punched it out. Cao and Wang advanced together and passed it to Zhang Mingsheng, who shot with his left foot, but did not score. The Western Police counterattacked, but the iron leg saved the ball carelessly, kicking it into the abdomen. Peter gently passed it to Hootley, who passed it to Greenburg, but Greenburg's shot was too soft, and Zhongen threw himself to the ground to catch it. Only five minutes before halftime, Livingstone rushed in from the left and made a wonderful hook in front of the goal. Peter showed his eyes, and the Western Police finally won back a goal. Then Peter received a long pass from Jefferson, but Dai Tui blocked it in vain, and Peter shot at the goal from ten yards, but fortunately it was biased and did not hit. Li Yichen shot high at the enemy's goal, and Willie first punched it out, then caught it, and finally managed to escape danger. Before halftime ended for only one minute, Cao Qiuting took a corner kick, and Li Yichen headed it in, also making a contribution. In the first half, Lido took a 4-2 lead.

Lido Wins the Silver Cup

Changing sides again, in less than a minute, Hootley used a lightning-fast method to dribble to the baseline and cross. Zhongen blocked it, and the ball hit the crossbar and bounced down. Greenburg stood up to meet it and bumped it into the goal. The Western Police had scored 3 against 4, only one goal behind, and their attack became more urgent. The enemies of Lido galloped in the abdomen. Livingstone got the ball kicked by Sun Jinshun, rushed forward and hooked it in. Zhongsi was tall and抱球出险 , . Peter received a pass from Hootley and swept wildly, but fortunately it hit the goalpost. Seeing that the situation was not good, Lido turned to defense and attacked. Wenkui shot, and Wei He threw himself to the ground to catch it and slid away. When Yichen rushed up, the ball had already been pressed down by Willie. Jefferson took a long shot, and Greenburg headed it, but both were saved by Zhongen. At 36 minutes, Wang Kehou received a pass from Li Yichen and passed it to Xu Wenkui. Xu broke into the penalty area, but no one came to block him. At the start of 怪脚 (strange foot), he was unexpectedly deviating. Although the Western Police tried their best to tie (扎, to prickle, struggle), they were 无奈心余力细 (too weak, tired) and time passed, Lido won the championship 4-3.

### Shanghai Lido Football Team Scheduled to Come South on May 5th, To Play Two or Three Matches After Arriving in Hong Kong

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Lido Football Team, champion of this year's Scott Cup (a tournament system similar to Hong Kong's Special Silver Shield Competition), achieved this glorious result as a Division C team, which is truly commendable. It can also be said that this is a unique achievement in Shanghai football.

However, although Lido is temporarily participating in the Division C league due to qualification restrictions (the Shanghai Foreign Football League has a regulation that newly formed teams, regardless of their talent, cannot immediately join the Division A competition, but must first participate in the Division C or reserve league, and can be promoted after achieving excellent results. Given that Lido has achieved excellent results in the Division C league and has also won the Scott Cup, there should be no problem for them to join the Division A league next season), their players are top-notch and their strength is very high. Players such as Sun Jinshun, Lu Zhongen, Cao Qiuting, Xu Wenkui, and Tan Fuzhen have long been famous and are top players. To be honest, Lido's talent is not much different from that of the Tung Wah team, which is likely to win second place in the current Division A league.

The news of Lido's upcoming matches in Hong Kong has been circulating for a long time. However, yesterday, the reporter received confirmation of when they will travel south. The team recently sent a letter to a person in charge of the Eastern Athletic Association, stating that they have scheduled to travel to Hong Kong as a team on May 5th and plan to play two or three matches after arriving. The schedule and opponents for the matches will be handled by the Eastern Athletic Association in consultation with the Football Association. According to the person in charge of the Eastern Athletic Association, they plan to have Eastern Athletic Association play one match, and the Hong Kong Port Team, which has returned from a tour of the Philippines, will play the second match. However, as the Eastern Athletic Association is currently preparing for a southern expedition, the arrangements for hosting Lido's visit to Hong Kong will be planned after their return from the southern expedition.

### The Effectiveness of Morning Exercises (3)

— Zhuoyue

(6) Increasing Lung Capacity and Preventing Tuberculosis

There are many ways to transmit tuberculosis. Generally, they can be divided into transmission from close contacts and environmental transmission. Prevention of transmission from close contacts is a very broad issue, and fundamentally requires research and solutions from the perspective of relationships. As for environmental transmission, the problem is even greater. Preventive methods certainly cannot focus on one aspect alone, but require research from various aspects of the social environment in order to find a solution. As for hygiene and epidemic prevention... there will be special discussions on this, so I won’t elaborate. I believe that the biggest causes of transmission are weak bodies (with pathological conditions) and dirty air. These two aspects are interrelated, and the most economical and effective preventive measures are those that everyone is determined to take and has the perseverance to implement, namely physical exercise – morning exercise. Because the chest exercises in morning exercise can directly enlarge your chest cavity, leading to healthy development, and directly enable the internal organs to achieve the same effect. Deep breathing exercises (lung and chest cavity exercises) can directly promote the expansion of lung capacity, and indirectly enlarge the chest cavity. Therefore, people who often perform deep breathing and chest exercises achieve healthy development and maintain health of both the body and internal organs. Furthermore, because we can obtain fresh air every day, washing and cleaning the dirt from our lungs, tuberculosis has no opportunity to thrive. (To be continued)

### Democracy—The Bridge to the Shores of Victory

— Du Ai

——In Anticipation of the Establishment of Political Participation Councils in Various Counties and Cities

Democratic politics is enthusiastically supported by modern people because it represents the will of the entire people and is an organization that seeks harmony and happiness. The term "representation," as in the case of the Soviet Union, is not just about reflecting and transmitting ideas; more importantly, it is about faithfully executing the will of the people being represented, seeking their well-being and benefits, and turning people's noble will and reasonable demands into real things that are universally present in reality.

Whether it is art or science, genius or truth, if these things are to be fully developed and to bloom with all their might, it is first necessary to secure the survival and liberation of the nation that guarantees these developments and blooms. The main condition for a nation to gain survival and liberation lies in how to increase and unite the dynamic forces hidden within the entire people, and in how to seek the enthusiastic participation of the people in the political organization. This can only be accomplished through a democratic system. Therefore, it is very clear that genuine democratic politics is the only guardian of all art and science, genius or truth, ideals and desires, happiness and humanity, to ensure that they obtain endless and rational development.

Our current war of resistance is a common cause of the entire people. The need for greater advancement of democratic politics is as clear as the need for constant replenishment and addition of new forces to the war of resistance. The establishment of the National Political Participation Council is precisely to unleash the power of the entire people to help the government achieve the arrival of that glorious, infinitely joyful, eternally victorious final outcome.

The past three sessions of the National Political Participation Council have repeatedly expressed the opinions of the broad masses of people regarding democracy, survival, and liberation; they have repeatedly strived to provide many forces that directly contribute to the war of resistance and national construction to our country's great struggle, allowing the people of the entire country to begin to breathe fresh air and pushing the entire political system towards democratization. This is something that everyone should commend. However, because the National Political Participation Council failed to establish a systematic organization at all levels for a time, it would have been able to exert a greater role. Now, the Political Participation Councils in various counties and cities are accelerating their establishment, and there is news that the Political Participation Councils in various counties and cities in Guangdong are scheduled to be established on April 1st. We hope that the National Political Participation Council, with a systematic organization and a grassroots foundation, will be able to more fully reflect the opinions of the people and further unleash the power of the people's resistance.

The Second National Political Participation Council passed the "Strengthening the Implementation of the Three Principles of the People" resolution. As the Political Participation Councils in various counties and cities are about to be established, we believe that the aforementioned resolution must first be earnestly strengthened and implemented in the Political Participation Councils that practice the Three Principles of the People. Regarding the selection of candidates for political participation in various counties and cities, it should include representatives from various professions, fully adhere to the principles of the United Front, and strive to absorb members from various parties and factions in various counties and cities, leaders from all sectors, and outstanding representatives of non-partisan people's organizations, at the very least in accordance with the organizational composition of the National Government. Only in this way can a broad national foundation be established and the opinions of the people be fully expressed, making the entire National Political Participation Council even more sound and solid, and actively promoting the implementation of the program for resistance and national construction.

Those who act as the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, and heart of the people are not just writers. All cultural workers, artists, and soldiers are included. However, precisely because this is a new political construction directly related to the people's welfare and the cause of resistance and national construction, workers in this "cultural" sense should be even more enthusiastic and concerned than others! Therefore, the current cultural workers should not neglect, and should regard as one of the most important tasks, how to promote the establishment of a new political system and make it develop in line with ideals, and should enthusiastically and regularly carry it out.

### Brief Discussion on Literary Correspondence

— Bai Ying

There have been many discussions in newspapers about literary correspondence. The proposal of this idea is always desirable, because literary correspondence is not only suitable for the current situation of the war of resistance, but also has its own place in the future peaceful era. Literary correspondence can be said to be a branch of reportage literature. Reportage literature, because it originates from the author's perspective, is inevitably somewhat subjective—at least in the minds of general readers. Literary correspondence can be said to be a two-sided reportage literature. Several writers—regardless of whether they know each other personally—organically report the situations that occur in their respective locations to each other's readers. Even if the writers each write their own subjective views, or even involve some personal trivia, as long as this trivia does not completely deviate from the larger reality, then readers can infer the objective truth of an event from the large and small events described by the correspondents on both sides.

Although the proposal of domestic literary correspondence is a recent event, literary correspondence has long been practiced internationally, since the birth of Esperanto by Bai Chai Huo Pu. The countries that most enthusiastically promoted international literary correspondence in Esperanto should be the Soviet Union. In the past, Shanghai had an Esperanto newspaper called La Mo ds, which introduced things like international literary correspondence. The majority of Soviet Esperanto youth groups often held correspondence with similar groups in various countries, and published good things on bulletin boards or other publications. Even individuals who are learning Esperanto often conduct correspondence with each other. Although this correspondence is not necessarily strictly literary, the academic discussions, reports of local situations, and exchange of personal ideas are still widely regarded as literary correspondence. Although the author personally does not know the current development situation in this regard, I deeply feel that this method is very desirable. If a national language is used to promote domestic literary correspondence, the result must be easier to develop universally than international communication in Esperanto.

We believe that although the development of the literary correspondence movement must initially be encouraged and promoted by newspapers and magazines, and publish more excellent things of this kind, the main goal of those engaged in literary correspondence is still to exchange knowledge and ideas, rather than to publish their correspondence. Personal connections are fostered through shared interests, which objectively amounts to the automatic organization of the masses, which is undoubtedly a great help to China in the current war of resistance.

Regarding the form of literary correspondence, if the purpose is to publish, then of course it will still be in a form similar to reportage literature. But if individual or group correspondence is adopted, and some trivial (but not necessarily purely personal) narratives are added to the content, then this will definitely make the other party readers feel a sense of intimacy, and readers who are third parties will also feel more interested.

### Article Cleansing Movement

— Bo

Articles are like a large mirror, which can reflect various aspects of society and all real life, but the degree to which they reflect accurately depends on whether the surface of the mirror is clean or not. If internal and external defects and dust obscure it, it will be difficult to fulfill its greatest responsibilities of reflecting reality and indicating the future. Therefore, launching an article cleansing movement at this time is not an unnecessary thing.

The current articles of various types in Hong Kong are like a not very clean mirror. If you first observe the ordinary people who are engaged in writing in detail, then you can clearly see the following three points: The first is that there are too many people who adhere to formalism. The things they write are like "raising children." If there is a cause, you can definitely guess the result. Whether it is theory or literature, this tendency is unavoidable. The heroes in the articles must be upright and towering figures, and the prisoners must be humble figures who kneel down. Imitation outweighs creation, and the portrayal of typical characters and individual personalities is rarely successful. As a result, it completely turns into an ideal state, far removed from real life, and is finally called "anti-Japanese stereotype." The second type of people stand on a writing position that is not bad, but unfortunately their experience is still insufficient. For example, if his intention is to write about the courageous battles of our army, but because of excessive exaggeration, he writes about them being as tyrannical as × people. Or, if he analyzes the dynamics of the masses in the rear during wartime and makes an introduction, he also incorporates some negative elements into it due to improper propaganda, thus unintentionally doing counter-propaganda for others. And the third type of people seems to be born with a sentimental disposition. They still cannot cure it in the war of resistance. They always pick some sentimental and gray topics and write articles of the type "Thinking, Remembering, Sending, Cherishing, Mourning, Dreaming," which makes others want to be sad for him. Although this type of article is enough to show that we do not forget the old things, what positive meaning does it have besides "showing"? It is useless to others and only wastes one's own emotions. The problems with the above three types of articles lie in adhering to formulas, distorting the theme, and deviating from reality. To do clean work, you should first treat these diseases in each person's article. Each person understands his own article, so this aspect of the article cleansing movement can be carried out automatically by the writers themselves, enriching their creative ability, clarifying the theme, and fully understanding the meaning of the times. Then the article can always reach a clean point, without any flaws and without any toxins!

Regarding cleaning the articles of others, I can also put forward principles and discuss them in two points. One point is to cleanse the articles of pro-peace advocates, in order to cut off the tools of traitors to tempt people's hearts. In institutional publications and pamphlets, they constantly promote pro-peace views that advocate national subjugation and humiliation, praising resistance while secretly planning cunning schemes. And the articles they write are actually also indirect and seemingly well-reasoned. If those who do not know the truth read them, they are very likely to be deceived. Therefore, launching a collective force to severely criticize this kind of absurd propaganda and cleansing the ears of dirty articles is our minimum work. Another point is a large number of obscene tabloids that I am very reluctant to mention but cannot help but mention. These superficial "businessmen" publish tabloids that sell ridiculous "romantic novels" for their own benefit. Although it is a small three-day publication, its sales are often higher than those of major newspapers. Just the fact that dozens of tabloids can survive at the same time shows how many people in Hong Kong are devoted to "obscene newspapers." Moreover, those novels will also be published in single volumes or continued in second and third volumes because of the "large audience." Can you ignore the potential of this subtle influence to "spread poison"? Perhaps it is not as obvious as pro-peace remarks, but people always do not see good virtue as well as lust. Such words are enough to erode ambition and are really terrible. Therefore, using the power of public opinion to criticize this kind of "fragrant and beautiful" article is as necessary as the former. If we can go a step further and implement powerful sanctions against the above-mentioned poisonous articles of "pro-peace" and "obscene," then that is naturally what we expect.

### Entrustment

— Hu Weizhou

When our ambulance drove through Zhucun for the second time, the situation was even more tragic: rubble, broken wood, and newly created large craters were everywhere, reflected in the dark evening light, seeming to accuse those who came later.

Everyone's mood was very chaotic, and the headquarters would often lose contact with us, making us wander around the enemy's artillery range; but who can you blame for this situation? --Forget it, anyway, the lives of Chinese people are often entrusted to the philosophy of fate.

After we decided to continue forward, we started the engine and drove straight to the front line; however, we were stopped halfway.

"Hey! Ambulance team... brothers! Save... save us!... "

On a highway four miles away from the front line, our trucks were stopped by many wounded soldiers. The ground was full of lying and crouching wounded soldiers. Some of them were severely wounded, and except for intermittent breathing, everything else had been gone. The air was stagnant with a terrifying and empty mood, shrouding the entire blood-red prairie. I still remember clearly: there was a Hakka artilleryman who had part of his arm blown off. He held up the remaining stump, stained dark red with blood and dust, and crouched by the field, still occasionally and unconsciously picking up the pale blood-soaked hand that had been blown off, gazing and gazing again, gazing without sorrow, without pain, without a smile, and without any expression at all.

"Comrade! Why don't you put your injured arm down? Isn't it painful to hold it up?"

"I... I'm afraid... my blood... is flowing... flowing too much... I... I want to live... "

Just like that, my heart, which was trembling for the pitiful and fragile, suddenly became strong, turning into only admiration and emotion, and silently reciting the sentence "I still want to live!"

All kinds of scars, all kinds of thorns pierced my heart. If it weren't for the dangerous place in front, I would definitely stay by their sickbeds for a long time, give them more comfort, and sing more songs about their tragic stories!

There was also another brother who was more seriously injured. He weakly took out a paper packet from his pocket, which contained three one-yuan "Guangdong paper bills," and insisted that we listen to him:

"Brothers! Take it, my salary! I'm--done! I... I can't do it anymore!--Don't let the Japanese devils grab it and buy guns to fight us--Go! I! I...!"

His last soul's cry disturbed my heart. I immediately put down the living wounded soldiers and helped him, until he gradually lost consciousness. I held back a handful of sympathetic and angry tears, and wished infinite blessings for the martyrs.

We carried eight soldiers who had not died, also trembled with the heroic spirits of the sacrificed, promised the soldiers' last entrustment, and started the engine and drove towards the bright path.

### Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

The light was turned on, by that person who had been hidden behind the coat rack. He then appeared. The maid, upon seeing him, was immediately terrified, like a felled tree trunk. To prevent her commotion, he used his foot to step on her neck, making it difficult for her to breathe: her face flushed red, and saliva flowed from her mouth. The girl, even more frightened by his violence, could not bear the sight of the ruthlessness, the brutality, the innocence, and the guilt. Therefore, gritting her teeth, she asked him:

"Are you also a volunteer army soldier?"

This sarcastic question prompted him to simply answer her:

"No, I am a bandit!"

"Perhaps also an experienced bandit, otherwise, so skilled, so violent!"

She thought, and therefore, she restored her original good feelings towards the volunteer army, while her hatred for bandits deepened.

He turned off the electric light again, hoping to leave calmly in the darkness.

The bedroom was still in darkness, as silent as if there was no one there. Now was the time for him to take her away.

However, due to his composure and her submission, it aroused in him a kind of inexplicable sympathy that violated his own actions, so he quietly asked her:

"Can you forgive me?" (Sixteen)
