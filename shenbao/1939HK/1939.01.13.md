### On "Anti-Communism"

The telegram of Wang Jingwei's clique has long been rejected by the people of the whole country, and this newspaper has also repeatedly written articles to refute it. Unexpectedly, according to recent news, Wang's faction has recently been spreading rumors in various places, confusing public opinion, and especially emphasizing the "anti-communist" point, in order to mislead people, slander the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, and alienate the unity of the Chinese people. Their sinister intentions are truly hateful. Therefore, we do not hesitate to expend words and will discuss the "anti-communist" point again in order to correct public understanding. The so-called "common anti-communism" is to force China to join the "Anti-Comintern Pact of Japan, Germany, and Italy." Therefore, first of all, we must understand what the nature of the Anti-Comintern Pact is, and whether it would be beneficial to China to join this pact.

We can directly answer in one sentence that the Anti-Comintern Pact is a conspiracy by fascist aggressors to "confuse right and wrong" and a false guise to cover up their aggression. The famous British political commentator G.T. Garratt once gave a good explanation of this:

The aggressive front shouts out the "Communist scarecrow" to confuse strong enemies in democratic capitalist countries, and many liberals are also misled by it. If these liberals had not been blinded by the fascist anti-communist smoke screen, they would have opposed aggression long ago.

The aggressors take advantage of this weakness of democratic countries and carry out their aggression under the smoke screen of "anti-communism." The German-Italian joint attack on Spain was said to be "anti-communist"; Hitler's seizure of Austria and dismemberment of Czechoslovakia was said to be "anti-communist"; the Japanese warlords' massive invasion of the Republic of China based on the Three Principles of the People was also said to be "anti-communist"! If it is anti-communism, why don't the Brownshirt troops march towards Moscow, but instead "bully the weak"? If it is anti-communism, the Changkufeng conflict should be a good opportunity to oppose communism, why did the Japanese warlords shrink back? From this point of view, although the "Anti-Comintern Pact of Japan, Germany, and Italy" carries the guise of "anti-communism," it is actually an organized attack on democratic countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. Not long ago, it was widely rumored that a military alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy would be signed, and this alliance was more clearly aimed at the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. In short, the Anti-Comintern Pact of Japan, Germany, and Italy is an alliance of aggression. China is being invaded, so would it be willing to throw itself into a trap and become a vassal of the aggressors? This is one point. Secondly, China bases its nation on the Three Principles of the People, and the spirit of the Three Principles of the People lies in the realization of democratic politics. Joining the fascist "Anti-Comintern Pact" is equivalent to abolishing the Three Principles of the People and abolishing the Kuomintang. Thirdly, the Anti-Comintern Pact not only takes the Soviet Union as its enemy, but also takes democratic countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and France as its targets of attack. Today, it is the Soviet Union and countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and France that are assisting China in resisting Japan. Joining the "Anti-Comintern Pact" is equivalent to "recognizing a thief as a father" and cutting oneself off from friends. The above points are all in terms of foreign affairs.

Secondly, domestically, everyone knows that Kuomintang-Communist cooperation is the foundation of the national united front for China's resistance against Japan today, and it is the greatest guarantee for China's resistance to achieve final victory. The painful experiences of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party over the past ten years have created an opportunity for Japanese imperialism to infiltrate, and the survival of the Chinese nation has become a problem. Now, they have finally resolutely abandoned their past grievances and cooperated closely to rescue China's independence and survival. Today, no one can deny the fact that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are standing together like brothers. Today, the Chinese Communist Party has clearly changed its revolutionary policy and is working for a China based on the Three Principles of the People. The loyalty of the Chinese Communist Party to the resistance against Japan is not even denied by the Japanese, which can be further proved by the deep hatred of Japanese imperialism and traitors towards the Communist Party.

Since Kuomintang-Communist cooperation has become a huge force to prevent Japanese imperialism from invading, Japanese imperialists and their lackeys will naturally do everything possible to undermine it. They take advantage of the prejudices of some people and spread many rumors about Kuomintang-Communist friction, trying to break up their unity. "Anti-communism" has become a false guise for traitors to betray the country today and a synonym for the Japanese warlords to destroy China. This is a point that the Chinese people should pay great attention to.

Therefore, today the Chinese people must do everything in their power to support Kuomintang-Communist cooperation and must deeply appreciate Sun Yat-sen's declaration in the second year of the Republic: "There is no need to ask about the size of the party, only whether the policies advocated by our party and the daily actions can conform to public reason and whether they can correspond to the times. If the policies are upright and clear, and are approved by a share of the people, even if there are thousands of difficulties and setbacks, we can hope for the final victory. As for other parties, in addition to discussing political views, all disputes of emotion are not only unnecessary, but also enough to damage the reputation of the political party."

As long as the Chinese people sincerely support Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, all the conspiracies of villains and traitors will be powerless. As long as the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can strengthen cooperation, the national united front for resistance against Japan will become more and more consolidated, and China's resistance against Japan will surely achieve final victory.

### The Jiangnan People's Self-Defense Corps Actively Deploys to Recover Lost Territory, Advocating Extensive and Narrow Warfare, Mobilizing the Entire Nation to Participate in the War of Resistance

[Zhenjiang Dispatch] Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the people's armed forces have also been developed as much as possible. For example, the "People's Self-Defense Corps Against Slavery" is also active. The Jiangnan Detachment Command of the Corps is now actively deploying to recover lost territory and is said to be aiming to recover Guangde, Changxing, and Yixing first. If these three locations are recovered, they can control the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. The headquarters is also promoting the division of labor and cooperation between the military and the people, advocating extensive warfare and narrow warfare, and has issued various propaganda materials to thoroughly educate the people. Excerpts from the propaganda materials are as follows: (1) If the name of the war is not correct, then the words will not be reasonable; if the words are not reasonable, then things will not succeed. Therefore, the gentleman must be able to speak, and what he speaks must be practicable. This is why Confucius said to Zilu that it must be the correction of names when Wei Zhe seized the country and rejected his father. To talk about this, no matter what, it is always most important and most necessary to correct the name, let alone a war that concerns the national personality. Tang Dynasty's Jie attacked Zhou, and Wu attacked Zhou to save the people; Han Gao raised his troops to drive out the violent Qin; Zhuge Liang attacked Wei to restore the Han Dynasty; Li Yuan attacked Sui, following the will of heaven and responding to the people; Ming Taizu transferred the throne and Sun Yat-sen overthrew the Manchu Qing Dynasty for nationalism; Washington's independence from Britain was unbearable under British abuse; the North and South American bloody battle for many years was for Lincoln to liberate black slaves. These are all famous divisions and can seize people first. What about Japan? The September 18th Incident occupied our four eastern provinces, the January 28th Incident disturbed our Shanghai, the July 7th Incident suddenly attacked our Lugou Bridge, and the August 13th Incident invaded our Shanghai in a big way. All of these were wars without declaration. The reason why they did not declare war is that their divisions were nameless. Now try to question its legitimate reasons for the war, and I dare say that no one can answer it for them. However, our country is different. Japan's cruelty to our people is actually to insult our people's personality, and we use war to preserve it. Japan's threats and inducements to our people are actually to overthrow our people's personality, and we use war to preserve it. Japan's enslavement policy to our people is actually to destroy our people's personality, and we use war to build a strong guarantee so that the word personality can be displayed for all time and be as bright as the sun and stars, lasting as long as heaven and earth. With a correct name and reasonable words, how can Japan be cunning? (2) Extensive Warfare and Narrow Warfare, as the saying goes, "Soldiers can be unused for a hundred years, but they cannot be unprepared for a day." Preparation means not forgetting war. We must prepare for war before we can talk about war. However, there is tangible preparation and intangible preparation; there is tangible war and intangible war. Tangible preparation is what we use to prepare for people; intangible preparation can make people relax their preparation and forget about our preparation. Tangible war, although fighting hard, cannot guarantee victory; intangible war can subdue people without fighting. This is the difference between extensive and narrow warfare. What is narrow warfare? Tangible preparation and tangible war are it. What is extensive warfare? Intangible preparation and intangible war are it. Zhao Lingwang changed to Hu clothing and learned to ride and shoot, and the Xiongnu did not dare to peek at the border of Zhao. This preparation belongs to the tangible. Goujian's ten years of recuperation and ten years of training eventually led to the demise of Wu. This belongs to the intangible. Zhou Yu defeated Cao Cao at Chibi, and Xie An defeated Fu Jian at Shui. This war belongs to the tangible. Tao Kan moved bricks to practice hard work, and Liu Kun danced to the crowing of the rooster. Although it has nothing to do with warfare, the spirit of warfare has been revealed in the intangible. Since ancient times, the scholars and officials of our country have practiced archery and charioteering, and the princes did not abandon hunting. In fact, it is the same as Westerners' horse racing, boat racing, and ball games, promoting the spirit of martial arts and preparing for future candidates. It is not necessary to wait until the war has already started to begin training. Alas, extensive warfare is actually more urgently needed than narrow warfare. Japan, with the full force of its navy, army, and air force, invades our country. This clearly belongs to the category of narrow warfare, but I don't know that they have devoted themselves to extensive warfare for decades before daring to launch a large-scale invasion of our country, such as economic invasion, cultural invasion, and the establishment of special agencies in various provinces of North China. There is nothing that does not start from the four words of extensive warfare. Alas, it is terrible. Therefore, our country must launch a universal movement of extensive warfare with all its strength, up and down, to deal with Japan. Gandhi spins yarn, weaves cloth, sun-dries salt, and even fasts in order to achieve India's independence. Piłsudski teaches piano to restore Poland. These are the best models of extensive warfare, which our people urgently need to emulate. If we can learn its meaning and train the whole country to be soldiers, even if Japan is strong, it will not be difficult to make a plan to annihilate it in one fell swoop. Alas, how can we have a home if the Xiongnu are not destroyed? At the critical moment of life and death, we only strive for the last moment. People of our country, don't neglect it.

(3) The Meaning of Extensive Warfare. The meaning of extensive warfare has been elaborated briefly in the previous article on extensive warfare and narrow warfare. However, the importance of extensive warfare will be hundreds of times greater than that of narrow warfare. The following is a supplement. The meaning of extensive warfare and its importance, and its theory are scattered in the special biography, but it is not more detailed than the book of Mencius. He said to King Hui of Liang, "If the king implements benevolent governance to the people, reduces punishments, reduces taxes, deepens the cultivation and eases the weeding, and uses the leisure days of the strong to cultivate their filial piety, brotherhood, loyalty, and trustworthiness, to serve their fathers and brothers at home, and to serve their elders when they go out, he can make them use sticks to beat the strong armor and sharp soldiers of Qin and Chu." He also said, "To unite the people is not to use the boundaries of the territory, to solidify the country is not to use the mountains and valleys, and to threaten the world is not to use the benefits of military weapons. Those who gain the Tao get more help, and those who lose the Tao get less help. When there is the most little help, even relatives will betray them. When there is the most great help, the people will follow them. To attack those who are betrayed by their relatives with what the world follows, therefore the gentleman does not fight, and if he fights, he will win." Although Mencius did not determine the noun of extensive warfare, its theory has already revealed the meaning and importance of extensive warfare without leaving anything. Mencius advocated that if we want military victory, we must first pay attention to the people's army. What is the people's army? Teaching youth and politics. Seeking victory in the military is like digging a well when thirsty. Starting from education and politics is like treating a disease, preparing for the future. Looking at ancient times and looking at the nine continents, they cannot be ignored beyond the theoretical scope of Mencius. The demise of Wu by Yue, and France's victory were all based on education and politics. This time, the Japanese launched a large-scale invasion, which was also due to their meticulous governance for decades, so they dared to disregard it in order to make a move. Aircraft and cannons are just tools for them to become sharp weapons in narrow warfare. Duke Huan of Qi united the princes nine times without military vehicles, and Duke Wen of Jin attacked Yuan to show faith and show etiquette in a big way. He became a hegemon in one battle. All of these are preparations for war without war, and this effect was obtained. However, I think that even when the two countries meet with soldiers, they cannot rely solely on strong armor and sharp soldiers to destroy the strong enemy. Zhizhi Wu was originally a resigned doctor, but he relied on lobbying to repel the violent Qin. Zheng Xiangao, with the qualification of a merchant, pretended to reward the army to relieve the national crisis. Sun Wu reduced the stove to avenge, Zhuge's empty city retreated the enemy, and Zhang Zifang pulled out the banner to change the flag. These are all called using it in one's heart, and it is up to the generals to be magical and understand it. Moreover, to gain the hearts of the army, we must first gain the hearts of the people, and if we gain the hearts of the people and use them well, we can achieve the effect of the whole country being soldiers. If we do not use them well, we will immediately face the danger of being in the same boat as the enemy. The people are like water, and water can carry a boat or overturn it. The common people can be deceived, but they cannot be deceived. Therefore, I will discuss the importance of extensive warfare in detail and briefly attach my opinions here.

### Ziliujing, the Largest Salt Field in Sichuan, in the Tide of Resistance Against Japan (Continued from Yesterday)

— Xue

But the work of national salvation here is also in progress. There are anti-Japanese singing groups and drama groups in Dongchang, and anti-Japanese propaganda singing and national salvation propaganda singing and drama groups in Xichang. The work is very good. Although there is no money, they still often go to nearby villages to promote. Each person contributes five cents or one cent, and each person is responsible for food. They go to the countryside every week. There are more than 300 members in the group, and the organizational components are mostly civil servants, teachers, and students, as well as shop assistants and workers. It goes without saying that each member of the singing group can sing at least a hundred or so national salvation songs, and can also sing several choruses of "Resisting the Enemy" and "The Flag is Flying." Even the peddlers selling cigarettes can sing a dozen or twenty popular national salvation songs. Their singing has spread to the lower classes of the people. In the past, they had "morning calls" and "evening songs," and there was once a singing propaganda week with a chorus of more than 30 people. Now I hear that they will have a singing competition before and after the New Year.

Because there are so many workers in Zigong, almost 70% are workers, especially many of them are low-wage workers. There is a need for a large number of subsidiary coins and copper coins to circulate here. Recently, it has been extremely difficult to exchange them locally. At one time, copper coins and subsidiary coins almost disappeared. The reason is that the traitors once fabricated rumors that "paper money is useless." At the same time, unscrupulous merchants took the opportunity to manipulate it, but the main reason is that there are too few subsidiary coins, and people have opportunities to take advantage of. This seems to be the responsibility of the government to adjust. These small questions can often confuse people and hinder the order of the rear. The war of resistance has been going on for more than a year, and enemy planes have visited several times, but our rear can still be said to be not tense. With what great efforts should we awaken them, correct them, organize them, and mobilize them?

### Foreign Reporters Talk About Why the New Fourth Army is Always Victorious: The Political Department is Really the Soul of the Army

[Shanghai Dispatch] Belden, a special correspondent for the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, reported that the main difference between the New Fourth Army I saw and other armies is not that they are braver in combat, nor that they live a harder life, but that their political department occupies an important position in combat. The political system is the lifeline of the army. Each team has a political instructor who leads the combat. He is in the front when attacking and in the rear when retreating. He must also scout the enemy's position, encourage the soldiers, and be a role model for every combatant. Therefore, the casualties of political workers are also high. The New Fourth Army can be divided into two systems: political and military. The chief of staff and the headquarters of the military are commanded by the commander-in-chief and the deputy commander, as well as the political instructors. Broadly speaking, the work of the political department is divided into two categories: one is to teach the theory of resistance against Japan and the writing of history, and the other is to ensure the success of the orders issued by the commander. According to the leaders of the army, "The most important purpose of 'politics' is to ensure the victory of the war of resistance." The reporter, after many investigations, also deeply believes in their words. The soldiers of the army are all volunteers, two-thirds of whom come from the southern provinces. These people are almost all guerrillas of the old Red Army, so political work is easier to carry out. However, there are also several weaknesses, such as the wide dispersion of military forces and the inability to contact each other. The political department strengthens the military force by political methods, first by increasing the political education of the soldiers, explaining why China is fighting, and telling every combatant why China must win. The political department also follows the traditions of the old Red Army, such as new soldiers fighting with old soldiers in difficult situations and living under difficult circumstances, and inherits the Red Army's spirit of loving the people and self-sacrifice. The New Fourth Army strictly prevents spies and traitors. The political instructors know the origins, abilities, and intentions of their soldiers, so no traitors have ever been found in the army. When the New Fourth Army first assembled in southern Anhui, because the enemy army had dominant aircraft, the political instructors explained tirelessly to the soldiers not to fear the enemy or to underestimate the enemy. Recently, it was discovered that officers and soldiers were wasting money and paper, so they began an economic movement and held meetings. The officers explained in detail the importance of economy, saying that there was little money in the army, and if materials and money were wasted, they would not be able to buy what they needed, which would affect the combat strength. Therefore, the officers and soldiers began to save money voluntarily. Recently, the New Fourth Army has been conducting a strong united front movement in the army by giving speeches in classrooms, shouting slogans, publicizing in newspapers, sticking up posters, and singing songs. The leaders of the army believe that this can strengthen combat effectiveness. The soldiers of the New Fourth Army are not limited to any belief. Members of the Kuomintang and the fallen bourgeoisie are also fighting in the army, because they do not use their belief in communism or the Three Principles of the People in the war of resistance. According to Deputy Commander Xiang Ying, the reporter said that no matter what their political beliefs are, we will accept them, but we are conducting political work in accordance with the principles of the Three Principles of the People.

The soldiers of the New Fourth Army must abide by three rules: (1) Resist Japan to the end, do not surrender to the enemy, and do not compromise; (2) Obey the orders of superiors; (3) Love the people. There are also six regulations: (1) Love military equipment; (2) Love public property; (3) Be punctual; (4) Be alert and lively; (5) Be tidy and clean; (6) Be gentle and courteous. The soldiers must also abide by ten points, which were followed by the former Red Army: (1) When borrowing accommodation in a civilian's house, when leaving, the wooden door and straw used for making the bed must be returned to its original place; (2) The floor must be wiped clean; (3) The language must be gentle; (4) Goods must be paid for at the original price; (5) Objects borrowed from the people must be returned; (6) If the borrowed object is damaged, the owner must be compensated for the loss; (7) When going to the toilet, the toilet must be used; (8) Bathing should avoid being seen by women; (9) Propaganda work should be done at any time; (10) Do not kill prisoners indiscriminately. The political workers tell the soldiers that they should voluntarily obey these rules. Occasionally, if there is a violation of the rules, they will not be beaten or scolded. Take the seventh rule as an example, the political worker will call the violator and tell him not to defecate anywhere, and that the offender is a disgrace to the army. If the soldier violates the rules a second time, a meeting will be held and the soldier's fault will be announced publicly. If the rules are violated a third time, he will be punished by cleaning or imprisoned in the prison cell for two hours. If a prisoner is killed, it is considered an extremely serious event. A general meeting is convened to thoroughly investigate the past behavior of the soldier who violated the rules. If it is found that his behavior is inappropriate and his intentions are bad, he may be sentenced to death. If it is found that the soldier was moved by righteous indignation, he will be severely reprimanded or imprisoned in the prison cell. The soldiers of the New Fourth Army live in extremely tidy places. I have seen them diligently cleaning and talking to the people very kindly, and I have seen them treating prisoners with care. All the soldiers of the army, except for officers such as staff officers, take daily classes, given by university students and university professors, etc., explaining the meaning of the united front and the war, the future of the war of resistance, and international relations, etc., and report the news at any time. Every morning when I get up, I see cooks, orderlies, and service soldiers sitting on the grass, listening quietly to the lecture. The officers do not attend classes, but hold discussions every month. Each team in the army has its own education plan and its own "National Salvation Room," which is a club voluntarily organized by the soldiers. Generally, there are portraits of Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek, Mao Zedong, and Zhu De, and sometimes portraits of Lenin and Stalin. Night meetings are held in each room every night, and newspaper reading classes, etc. are organized, and wall newspapers are posted, which are written by officers, soldiers, or orderlies, and the content is not fixed. After dinner, each team engages in games. A crude tennis court has been opened outside the hospital. The most popular game is hide-and-seek. The New Fourth Army publishes its own five-day newspaper called "Resistance Against Japan," with a circulation of 1,000 copies per issue. The Second Division also publishes its own newspaper called "Fireline," which publishes national military news and the war reports of the Second Division, and publishes and distributes a newspaper to the people called "National Salvation." Every Saturday and Sunday, soldiers perform songs, dances, and dramas at the rear headquarters, and on the front line, they perform at least once a month. The actors train themselves, and the scripts are also written by themselves. The above are all the work of the political department in the army.

### Promoting Education to Increase Resistance Strength, Establishing a Foundation for National Reconstruction, Tao Xingzhi and Others Propose at the Political Council

Reasons: (1) Now that Chairman Chiang has already instructed the launch of a comprehensive resistance war, we must universally create changes beneficial to resistance in all aspects of life. We must have comprehensive education to cooperate with comprehensive resistance, creating comprehensive cooperation between the military and civilians, and comprehensive unity among all parties, all classes, all religions, all professions, and all ethnic groups, to strive for the final comprehensive victory.

(2) Since the fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou, the more strongholds the enemy occupies, the more opportunities they have to create traitors and use our manpower and resources to fight us. We must plan. We must use the power of education to help achieve the state of "losing territory but retaining the people" in order to recover the lost territories. Moreover, what can be implemented behind enemy lines is guerrilla warfare. Without guerrilla education to cooperate with it, friction will occur between the people and the guerrillas, and friction will occur between guerrilla teams, neutralizing strength. The enemy will then be able to defeat us one by one. We must eliminate this fatal wound by popularizing national education to behind enemy lines.

Measures: (1) Principles for Popularizing Education for Resistance and National Reconstruction: The Three Principles of the People and the Outline for Resistance and National Reconstruction are the highest principles of popular education. Under the guidance of the highest principles, there should be the following concrete principles to guide the implementation of popular education:

(A) Schools and society should be united.

(B) The life of resistance and national reconstruction should be integrated with education for resistance and national reconstruction.

(C) Educate people to receive group education in group life.

(D) Educate people to use their hands, brains, and machines to receive education for resistance and national reconstruction in the work of resistance and national reconstruction.

(E) Practice what you learn immediately.

(F) Save time so that even busy people can be educated.

(G) Minimize expenses so that even poor people can be educated.

(2) People to be mobilized:

(A) Fully mobilize national intellectuals to do the work of guiding, editing, promoting, and training popular education teachers.

(B) Fully mobilize all literate adults and older children nationwide to teach illiterate people.

(C) Fully mobilize all those with special skills nationwide to pass on their skills to others.

(D) Fully mobilize all the people nationwide, regardless of gender, age, to improve amidst the flames of war.

(3) Educational organizations needed:

(A) Organize a Popular Education Association to assist the government in promoting popular education movements.

(B) Widely promote mass literacy schools on a large scale.

(C) Every militia training center should be a militia school, emphasizing real martial arts and political education.

(D) Every wounded soldier's hospital should be a wounded soldier's school, selecting outstanding wounded soldiers to teach the local militia, to boost morale. After recovery, they should return to the camp and reunite with frontline soldiers to exchange experiences and boost morale.

(E) Every refugee shelter run by the Relief Association should be a work-study group so that refugees can receive education in "working for a living, learning to understand life, and uniting to protect life."

(F) Every refugee children's shelter run by the Nursery Association and Relief Association should be a work-study group so that refugee children can establish a foundation for self-reliance.

(G) Every military unit should be a soldier's literacy school, fully utilizing literate junior officers or soldiers to teach illiterate soldiers, and the political department should fully mobilize intellectuals to promote political education. Military education for soldiers should make time to learn real martial arts and political education necessary for resistance.

(H) Establish a Coordination Association for Work Behind Enemy Lines (omitted below).

(I) Organize popular education touring groups, such as children's theater groups, the New An Touring Troupe, and the China Salvation Drama Society, to promote them on a large scale.

(J) Every Boy Scout should be an organization for immediate knowledge transfer, passing on what they have learned to others. Finally, every unit should establish a mass school or have everyone teach a few neighbors or relatives and friends. This work should be incorporated into the Boy Scouts as a regular task.

(4) General reforms that schools should have:

(A) Schools should ask about every lesson whether it can increase the strength of resistance and national reconstruction. We must make time to help popularize education and directly take turns in resistance service to receive education for resistance.

(B) Our students in the rear should always think about compatriots in the occupied areas and how to send salvation knowledge and strength to behind enemy lines.

(C) Utilize and adapt the original curriculum to increase the effectiveness of popular education, for example:

(I) Use "calligraphy" or "writing" courses for everyone to copy textbooks for the masses. Now paper is expensive, so this is a win-win situation.

(II) Use "civics" or "social studies" courses to train children to teach others, so they know the best citizens don't just talk about saving the country, but share their knowledge with the people, so everyone knows how to save the country, can save the country, and is willing to save the country. Then China will naturally live for ten thousand years.

(D) Pay special attention to education that combines hands and mind.

(E) Students who achieve results in popular education work and resistance service can receive academic credit.

(5) Popular education should fully utilize movies and radio.

(6) It is hoped that newspapers will promote popular education and strive for popular language to increase readers' interest and reduce difficulties.

### All Provinces in Occupied North China Launch Comprehensive Battle for Control, Our Original Units are Being Expanded Separately, Large Numbers of Fresh Troops Advance Behind Enemy Lines

[Special Dispatch from Luoyang, Our Newspaper, 12th] After our increase in fresh troops in the occupied areas of North China, our strength has been strengthened compared to before. The original troops are being expanded separately, and the guerrilla forces have also been adjusted and completed. A certain commander recently led his troops to garrison in certain areas, and all units under his command have also arrived at their respective locations. Shi Yousan's troops have arrived in a certain area of Chahar Province, and Shi will take office as chairman within days. Sun Dianying has been promoted to commander of a certain army. The Jinpu and Jiaoji railway lines are currently very terrorized. Villages near the railway have long been burned to the ground. Now the people are being forced to do construction work. We will take the initiative and launch a large-scale guerrilla war. After the recapture of various counties in western Shanxi, there are still remnant enemies resisting in the vicinity. We are currently suppressing them.

[Chongqing, Associated Press, 11th] According to official announcement, Chairman Chiang's Chongqing itinerary will be canceled as soon as possible (Editor's note: This news was first reported in our newspaper's Xi'an special dispatch on December 21). The Director of the Provisional Headquarters, Zhang Qun, will be transferred to an important central position. Chengdu and Kangding, the capital of Xikang Province, will soon establish military committees and offices respectively.

[Chongqing, Associated Press, 12th] A Chinese military spokesman stated that according to statistics released by the Military Affairs Commission, since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese army has suffered 700,000 casualties. 649 Japanese aircraft have been shot down or destroyed. 786 air force personnel have been killed or captured. 580 Japanese warships have been sunk or damaged. 1,200 tanks and armored vehicles have been destroyed or captured. 342 cannons, 4,166 light and heavy machine guns, and 72,592 rifles have also been captured or destroyed by our army.

The Entire Jinzhong Front Collapses, Our Army Sweeps Victoriously

[Xingji Telegram, Minkuo News Agency, 12th] Frontline news, our army launched a full-scale counterattack on the 9th and won a great victory. The entire enemy front collapsed, with casualties reaching more than one-tenth of the entire army, and countless wounded. Wherever the defeated soldiers went, they were pursued and swept away by our regular army and guerrillas, making them extremely embarrassed. Currently, remnant enemy troops are gathering in Linfen, 165 miles south of Taiyuan. Our army is still pursuing victoriously. We will be able to wipe out the enemy soon.

[Dianji Telegram, Minkuo News Agency, 12th] After our army recovered Danning, it advanced that night and recovered Wucheng. Since the 6th, the enemy has been surrounded by our Chen army and other units. By the afternoon of the 7th, Danning and Wucheng were successively recovered by our army. The enemy became even more panicked and abandoned the city and fled east on the evening of the 7th. Our army then recovered Puxian. The enemy fled to Huale Town, where they were intercepted by a certain unit of ours. Another unit ambushed the enemy from behind, inflicting heavy casualties. The remnants fled south to Xingkou, where they were again severely attacked by our ambush unit. Our pursuing troops have also arrived and surrounded the enemy on all sides. This group of remnant enemy troops will be annihilated in one fell swoop.

[Beijing, Associated Press, 12th] According to postal news, the situation in northern Shanxi and southern Suiyuan has been quite turbulent in recent weeks. The Japanese admitted that Chinese guerrillas occupied Guihua on the 23rd of last month and kidnapped local residents. A traveler from outside said that Chinese guerrillas also attacked Guihua on the 23rd of last month. "Man-Meng Xinbao" reported that on the 11th of this month, Chinese guerrillas attacked Huailai, between Nankou and Zhangjiakou, but retreated after the puppet security team and the Japanese army cooperated to resist.

Traffic Between Peiping and Tientsin Interrupted, Our Army Active in Jiangnan

[Special Dispatch from Shanghai, Our Newspaper, Morning of the 13th] Yamada, the commander of the Japanese expeditionary forces in Central China, flew here yesterday to convene a secret meeting with senior Japanese officers and special agents. The contents are unknown. After the meeting, Yamada boarded the "Izumo" warship to visit Lieutenant General Kawakami. One theory is that this visit is to discuss "cleaning up" our guerrilla forces along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines.

[Miluo, Central News Agency, 12th] On the evening of the 11th, a Japanese train with seven carriages was heading north from Yueyang. It was detected by our customs guerrilla forces, who first ambushed on the mountains on both sides of Mao Gang between Yunxi and Linxiang. When the Japanese train approached, they immediately opened fire with dense artillery. The Japanese train overturned, and more than a hundred Japanese officers and soldiers inside were killed.

Guangdong-Guangxi Enemy Forces Gather in Xijiang, We are Closely Guarded

[Special Dispatch from Zhongshan, Our Newspaper, 12th] According to local news, our planes flew over Shilong and Dongguan to distribute leaflets, advising the public to evacuate outside the city quickly, as we will immediately launch a counterattack on those two locations. We dispatched seventeen bombers to bomb Japanese warships anchored in the Pearl River. Two Japanese warships were hit and sunk. Remnant enemy forces in Zengcheng are now gathering in Shilong, Dongguan, Shitan and other places along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. It is speculated that the retreat of the Japanese army from the Dongjiang River is because the enemy intends to attack Guangxi from the Xijiang River. On the Xijiang River coast, in Sanshui and southwest, enemy reinforcements have arrived. Several enemy warships are anchored in Beihai, intending to use Weizhou Island as a base for military operations. The landing in Beihai may have to wait until next week, when the enemy's plans are fully prepared, or they will begin to stir. Our army is defending along the Zhao River. If the enemy invades, we will certainly strike hard.

[Guilin, Central News Agency, 8:00 PM, 12th] A large number of enemy soldiers are concentrated in Sanshui, and there are about five companies in the vicinity of Guangzhou.

### Government Spokesperson Denounces Enemy Propaganda, Our Internal Unity Grows Stronger, Enemy Methods are Ridiculous

[Chongqing, Associated Press, 12th] The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun has spread rumors that Madame Chiang Song Meiling has gone to Hong Kong to demand an immediate divorce from Chairman Chiang. Chinese people here have strongly denounced the absurdity of this news. A spokesperson said that Chairman Chiang and his wife are the most happy couple. The Japanese news has no basis and is completely malicious propaganda. Madame Chiang has not only not been to Hong Kong recently, but she also met with foreign reporters in Chongqing yesterday.

[Chongqing, Associated Press, 12th] A spokesperson for the National Government denied that Education Minister Chen Lifu had gone to Shanghai to join the Wang Jingwei faction. Chen was resting at home because he had caught a cold last week.

[Chongqing, Associated Press, 12th] A spokesperson for the National Government said that the content of the Nanjing puppet Reformed Government President Wen Zongyao's request for the Chinese people to accept the Konoe peace conditions was not worth criticizing. Wen was the most corrupt official in the Beijing government before Chairman Chiang's Northern Expedition in 1926. Not only did he smoke opium himself, but his daughter, Mary, participated in a major international drug trafficking organization several years ago, transporting opium to the United States and spending it extravagantly, eventually being arrested in New York. This shows a glimpse of Wen's character and his family management. The National Government continues to resist Japan with determination, while the Nanjing puppet government claims to rule twelve provinces in mainland China, but in reality, its orders barely leave the New Asia Hotel in Shanghai, and that hotel is under the strict protection of the Japanese army.

[Tokyo, Associated Press, 12th] A spokesman for the Japanese Navy said that the Japanese Navy attaches great importance to reports that the United States plans to establish a naval base in Guam. He also said that the American warship Luzon was escorted to Shanghai by a Japanese warship from the Yangtze River. The American warship officials made a statement to the press, stating that the Japanese escort ship fired indiscriminately at the banks of the Yangtze River, and its purpose was obviously to make Americans believe that the Yangtze River was unsafe.

### Guo Moruo Tells Foreign Reporters that the Doomsday of the Japanese Clique is Near, Domestic Masses are Frequently Agitated, Prelude to Cabinet Reshuffle

[Chongqing, Associated Press, 12th] Guo Moruo, the director of the Third Department of the Political Department, known as the "Japan expert" in the Chinese army, said to foreign reporters today, "The Japanese Hiranuma Cabinet is now doing its best to turn capitalist Japan into fascist Japan, and at the same time doing its best to implement the National Mobilization Bill. The intention of the bill is to seize the country's resources from the hands of the Japanese people and capitalists and transfer and concentrate them in the hands of young military officers. The Konoe Cabinet was the last line of defense for Japanese capitalists. Hiranuma's plan will naturally arouse the resentment of the Japanese people. Since the end of last year, the Japanese masses have been frequently agitated. In short, the Japanese Empire, under the internal and external attacks of its people's resistance and international sanctions, is not far from its demise. The recent cabinet reshuffle is only a prelude to its final collapse."

Because we have no urgent use, we have all politely declined. A certain friendly nation recently offered to lend us 20 million pounds, which we also did not accept. Although the War of Resistance has reached today, we are not short of money. Borrowing more money is a waste, so it is better not to borrow. British credit loans have purchased many vehicles, which have already been shipped.

### Military, Political and Diplomatic Developments Before the Start of the Second Phase of the War

— (Continued from yesterday's Chongqing dispatch in this newspaper)

Zhu Shaoliang and Jiang Dingwen were appointed to be in charge of the Northwest region. A new Northwest Headquarters was established in Xi'an, holding full responsibility for Northwest military affairs. In addition, Chen Jicheng, the director of the Central Military Academy's education department, was appointed as the head of the National New Recruit Training Center. 1.2 million new recruits will be trained in Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan provinces for replenishment of various armies and to recover lost territories. In accordance with the new strategy, it was decided that one-third of the national forces would penetrate deep behind enemy lines, one-third would defend key points on the front line, and the remaining one-third would be prepared for training and deployment as fresh troops for future decisive battles. Simultaneously, two war zones would be established in the enemy's rear to develop guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. Various tasks behind enemy lines would be strengthened, and a special agency would be established by the Military Affairs Commission, concentrating the power of the Party, government, and military to jointly counter the Japanese army's political offensive and destroy all traitors and puppet organizations. Chairman Chiang personally drafted the key points of the Second Phase of the War of Resistance: "Politics is more important than military affairs," "The rear is more important than the front," and "The people are more important than the soldiers." Chiang also believed that a revolutionary war must take a long time to be completed, and this war is ten times more important than any revolution in history. Even if it takes ten years, it is not too long, but in order to implement the planned goals, we are now limited to completing the great task of resisting the war and building the country within five years.

Political Developments

Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, our country's political situation has gradually improved bad systems. Furthermore, due to the urgent demands of the people of the whole country and the trend of the world, it is gradually moving towards democracy. The unanimous cooperation of all parties and factions in the country and the convening of the two National Political Consultative Conferences have achieved good results. Now, the provincial, municipal, and county councils are also being organized one after another. In the future, the decision-making of our country's national policies and the implementation of important political affairs will be decided by the people of the whole country, so as to promote the power of the people to meet the needs of the present situation. However, there are recent rumors that the central political situation is to be reorganized to strengthen the organizational structure and enhance administrative efficiency. However, the act of Wang Jingwei leaving the country will not have any impact on the central political situation. The original national policy and the consistent plan for resisting the war and building the country will not change due to Wang's departure.

Cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party

The cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, after several meetings and talks between Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the heads of the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, etc., the opinions have become more harmonious, and the cooperation has made progress compared to the past. The Communist Party decided to follow the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, unanimously supporting the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, supporting the National Government, believing in the Three Principles of the People, and supporting Chairman Chiang. The entire Communist Party unanimously accepts the guidance and orders of Chairman Chiang. Regarding the Three Principles of the People Youth League, which is presided over by the Kuomintang, the Communist Party also expressed its willingness to join. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China will submit the list to the Kuomintang. At present, both parties are discussing that the Eighth Route Army's Zhu De and Peng Dehuai troops are completely under the jurisdiction of the Military Affairs Commission and do not act independently. As for the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region administration under the Communist Party, the Communist Party will hand it over to the central government in its entirety, and the border region government will be abolished in order to unify the consistent loyalty of the Chinese people. Chairman Chiang will also discuss with the Communist Party to temporarily cancel the propaganda of Marxism. According to the current situation, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have become completely integrated without any estrangement.

Diplomatic Situation

The diplomatic route of our government was quite divergent in the past, without a definite goal. Therefore, since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the effectiveness of foreign aid has been minimal. It has been greatly rectified, and major changes have been made. In addition to Japan, we are doing our best to enhance friendship and promote diplomatic relations with all countries in the world. Especially after the establishment of British and American loans and the announcement of the Sino-American Silver Agreement, China's diplomacy has changed from a slow donkey to a downhill run. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now planning to further use diplomatic channels to obtain joint collective assistance from friendly countries to China. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is making the greatest efforts to adjust relations with various countries.

### Overview of the Week's Battle Situation —From January 2nd to 8th—

— Minister of Political Affairs Chen Cheng

The situation in Japan is that due to the general social conditions in the country, it has become restless. The true face of its outward strength but inner weakness will soon be revealed. The collapse of the Konoe Cabinet is a sign of this. Therefore, the warlords of the whole country are in a hurry. On the one hand, they are creating an atmosphere of peace, and on the other hand, they are actively transferring the exhausted shrimp soldiers and crab generals from Central China to Guangdong and Shanxi, attempting to cut off our international transportation lines in the Northwest and Southwest. However, Sima Zhao's intentions are well known to everyone, and how can they deceive us? Regardless of their strategy, tactics or offensives, the deeper the Japanese army penetrates into our interior, the more difficulties they will encounter, and the deeper they penetrate into our interior, the more advantageous it will be for us. This is because we have infinite power and can always deal with these clowns jumping around. At this time in the Second Phase of the War of Resistance, the Japanese invaders have penetrated deep into our interior. We must not only prevent them from advancing further, but also launch a full-scale counter-offensive, drive out the Japanese invaders, and recover our beautiful country. We hope that people in the world who sympathize with justice will wait and see. The following is a brief overview of the battle situation this week.

Guangdong Area

The main force of the Japanese army in Guangdong is about 20,000. Recently, no active actions have been discovered in the suburbs of Guangzhou, but they have been busy building fortifications in the suburbs of Guangzhou for days, as if they are determined to hold Guangzhou. The highway from Huaxian to Taipingchang has been automatically destroyed by the Japanese army, which proves their fear of our army's southward attack. On the 31st, the Japanese army on the Guangzhou-Conghua highway was intercepted by our strike team at Rongshupu near Taipingchang, killing a Japanese army second lieutenant and 20 soldiers, and capturing many rifles and military supplies. Then, about 1,000 Japanese soldiers. On the morning of the 1st, they advanced from Taipingchang to Dafanling Shuizao. By noon, more than 100 people had arrived at Shabai Village, about 500 people near Kuangcun, about 300 people near Chicao, and more than 400 infantry and cavalry near Sanbaidu Goumu. Their artillery fired hundreds of shells at our positions, covering the infantry's advance, and engaged in fierce battles with us. On the morning of the 2nd, the Japanese army could not hold on and retreated along the original road. In this battle, more than 100 Japanese soldiers were killed, and our casualties were only more than 20 people. The Japanese army in Zengcheng and Shetuling was attacked by our strike team on the night of the 1st. The Japanese army stubbornly resisted with fortifications. After a fierce battle at midnight, Shetuling was surrounded. Another unit broke into the north gate of the city and engaged in street fighting with the Japanese army. On the morning of the 2nd, the Japanese army rushed to support from Shitang Guangzhou. Our army had reached its mission and withdrew to its original position. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered about 90 casualties in Shetuling, and we captured more than 20 machine guns and many other steel helmets and gas masks. About 70 Japanese soldiers were killed in Zengcheng. In both places, our total casualties were two platoon leaders and more than ten soldiers. On the night of the 1st, our army attacked the Japanese army at Duanhekou in Nan'e, captured two machine guns and more than 70 boxes of gasoline, and the Japanese army suffered more than 70 casualties. In short, on New Year's Day, the Japanese army outside Guangzhou was attacked by our army from all directions and suffered heavy losses. As for the Beihai Weizhou Island, three Japanese warships arrived, including an aircraft carrier with about 300 Japanese soldiers. They have landed on Guozhou Island, and the Japanese army is looting and committing all kinds of evil, and the people are suffering unspeakably. Recently, Japanese warships have been gathering in the East China Sea, and it seems that they are planning to invade Jiangmen Siyi again. We are closely guarding against this.

Northern Hunan Area

The battle situation in northern Hunan is very quiet. Since our army attacked Taolin Fengjiacun on December 27th and killed several Japanese soldiers, the Japanese army has been very panicked. The Japanese army has been mobilizing from Taolin to Xitang for days. The road from Xitang to Qijiaju is being built, and it has now been completed. More than 100 Japanese soldiers in Shanglongwan are stationed around the area with barbed wire densely laid out. More than 300 civilians have been massacred before and after, and the people are fleeing in droves. On the 4th, our army destroyed three Japanese cars near the Kangwang Bridge east of Xinkaitang, killing more than ten Japanese soldiers, and capturing three rifles and many other military supplies. Another unit ambushed near Jiangshanping west of Xinkaitang, killing more than 20 Japanese soldiers and capturing four war horses. The Japanese army in Yueyang retreated eastward yesterday, and all the Japanese warships on the river also retreated to Bairuoji. Now Yueyang is just an empty city, and our guerrillas are advancing towards Yueyang. Southern Hubei is also very quiet. Our guerrilla troops only annihilated many Japanese soldiers in Xianning Yang area on the 1st, and captured three Japanese soldiers, Sato Ichiro, etc., and countless other military supplies.

Hubei Province

There are only small contacts. The Japanese army in Tianmen Jingshan Zaoshi Yangjiachang area has mostly withdrawn. Our army is pursuing the Yangjiachang area and has advanced to Chenglinggang, not far from Hanchuan City, and is still advancing. The Japanese army in Luoyangdian, Sui County, had a fierce battle with us on the 27th of last week. After being repelled, the Japanese army near Xihe and the Zhuangjiahe bank became restless again. On the 2nd, they used artillery to start a full-scale test firing at our positions, and then used more than 200 infantry to invade under the cover of their artillery fire. The Japanese army near Dashushan has increased, and it looks like they are going to invade Liu'an. We are prepared to give them a head-on attack.

Jiangxi and Anhui Areas

The Japanese army in Yongxiu Dean in northern Anhui was attacked by us on New Year's Day, and we captured a lot of them. Baisuo was once recovered by us, and we captured many steel helmets and other military supplies. The Japanese army north of Zhanggongdu shelled us on the 4th and also used poison gas. More than a dozen of our defending soldiers were poisoned and killed or injured. Our guerrilla troops attacked the Japanese army on the Jiuxing Highway on the night of the 4th. The Japanese army responded in a panic and was eventually killed by us by hundreds of people, and we captured more than a dozen rifles, a light machine gun, and many military supplies such as binoculars and bicycles. The Japanese army in Dangtu in southern Anhui attacked our Hongshipu with more than 200 infantry and cavalry on the afternoon of the 1st, but was repelled by our guerrilla troops. More than 300 Japanese soldiers also attacked our Guolongshan, but were also repelled by our defending soldiers. Therefore, the situation has been very quiet in recent days. The Japanese army in central and northern Anhui has been mobilizing frequently recently, and we are closely monitoring them.

Shanxi and Suiyuan Areas

The battle situation in southwestern Shanxi is very tense recently. The Japanese army in southern Shanxi is about 30,000. In view of the failure of the previous attack on Zhongtiao Mountain, they have recently adopted a defensive posture in Yongji, Jiexian, and Anyi. Another part of the force rushed to support Hejin and pursued Xiangning, Jixian, Daning, and Yonghe in western Shanxi, attempting to break through our base in the Shanxi-Suiyuan army, and then advance north to threaten, and then seize Yudu to realize their dream of invading Shaanxi. However, after our defending army launched head-on attacks, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses. They are still in a mixed war. In late December, more than 3,000 Japanese soldiers attacked Jixian from Linfen Hejin. On the 31st, they captured Jixian and stationed more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers in Jixian. One day later, they divided into three groups and invaded west, one towards Mafentuo, one towards Longwangba, and one towards Xiaochuanwo. Our troops on both sides of the river are attacking from both sides. In addition, the Japanese army in Longwangshan, Jixian, has increased to more than 1,000, and Xiaochuanwo has reached 600 to 700 Japanese soldiers, and the artillery battle with the eastern and western troops is quite fierce. A part of the Japanese army in Daning, hundreds of people, went south on the morning of the 3rd and engaged in a fierce battle with our army. The Japanese army on the highway was attacked by us on the night of the 30th of last month, and the Japanese army suffered more than 300 casualties. Our army is intercepting from all directions. Until the 7th and 8th, our full-scale counter-offensive was a great victory. Jixian Daning Xiang was successively recovered, and we are now pursuing the Japanese army. There have been no battles in Suiyuan so far. The Japanese army is urgently building an airport in Baotou Lafu. There have been troop mobilizations recently, and the situation is very tense, but they are secretly coming and going, just making a show of force.

Other Areas

Two giant Japanese warships recently arrived at Hui'an Xiuzhen Port in Fujian. On the morning of the 3rd, they fired 70 shells to cover the Japanese soldiers, attempting to land, but were repelled by our defending army. The Japanese defending soldiers in the Beijing Anti-Japanese War retreated to the Beijing-Hangzhou Highway. Our guerrillas have been very active recently. Liyang County was captured by the guerrillas, and they are now attacking Jurong Nanjing and other places from all directions. The Japanese army's attempt to sweep away our guerrillas has failed again. The Japanese army in Suqian Shaobo in northern Jiangsu has been restless recently, and we are preparing to meet them. The Japanese army in Lianyungang has repeatedly attacked Sunjiashan, but was eventually repelled by our army and is still confronting each other near Sunjiashan. In Linyi, Juye and other places in southern Shandong, our army has frequently launched attacks recently and captured a lot of them. About 800 puppet troops in Juye are fighting against the garrison in the city. There have been small contacts between guerrillas in Hebei, but there have been no major changes.

### Chamberlain's Sincere Speech at the Venetian Palace Banquet British and Italian Sides Continued Talks Yesterday Difficult to Achieve Substantial Results

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 12th] British and Italian senior officials have held their first meeting, lasting more than an hour, to allow British Foreign Secretary Halifax and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano to hold direct negotiations. British diplomats had smiles on their faces after the meeting, which is a good sign for the talks between the two countries' prime ministers and corresponds to the optimism expressed by the British and Italian newspapers in recent days. Although the start of the negotiations was full of friendly atmosphere, there is much speculation in London and Rome about the actual outcome of this meeting. The main issues of this meeting are still the Spanish issue and the Franco-Italian relations issue. It is believed that during the first meeting, the ministers of the two countries will explain their respective countries' views on specific issues. British officials have indicated that the British ministers do not want to obtain any specific results. If this meeting can produce a good atmosphere to achieve clarification of Mediterranean relations, it will be a major success. Recently, the official announcement is as follows: "British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano in the Italian Prime Minister's study for one hour and twenty-five minutes, and will continue to meet at 5:30 pm on Thursday."

[Reuters Rome, 12th] British Foreign Secretary Halifax, accompanied by Sir Cadogan and other advisors, visited Italian Foreign Minister Ciano at "Chigi Palace" at 11:00 am today. Prior to this, the official announcement stated that no important talks would be held. Halifax's visit was purely a courtesy visit. However, the two men met for about an hour. It is generally believed that Ciano has expressed Italy's views in order to contribute to peace, and this view can give the UK a full understanding. Ciano may have mentioned Franco's success in attacking Spain, urging the British side to pay attention, and Mussolini's concerns about the United States' request to mediate the Jewish refugee issue. After Halifax made a courtesy visit to Ciano, Chamberlain went to the tombs of the Italian emperors to present wreaths to express his respect and received enthusiastic cheers from the crowd. Later, Chamberlain and Halifax paid tribute to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The car they were riding in was led by six red motorcycle guards. The Governor of Rome and many senior Italian naval and military officers welcomed them at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. After Chamberlain paid tribute to the Unknown Soldier, he drove to the Quirinale Palace to pay homage to Italian Emperor Emmanuel and had lunch with the Italian Emperor at the palace.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 11th] After the first talks between British and Italian cabinet members, well-informed sources said that Mussolini had mentioned Italy's various demands on France. Chamberlain immediately refused to discuss them at length and suggested that the Italian authorities should stop the irredentist movement in the newspapers and negotiate directly with France. Once substantial progress is made, the UK is willing to help establish a smooth solution. Political figures said that the various demands made by Italy must be implemented, and Germany will definitely fully support them. Mussolini will do his best to seek British support for Italy's claims to the territory of Somalia in East Africa, the southern part of Tunisia in North Africa, and the revision of the border between Italy and Libya.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 12th] A French spokesman said that if Italy can make legitimate demands on France with a good attitude and without resorting to threats of force, France will be willing to discuss them with Italy. French government officials all believe that the talks between the former British Prime Minister and the French Prime Minister were very satisfactory. Also, when the British Prime Minister went to Italy, he would not only refuse to discuss the demands made by Mussolini to France, but also refuse to assist in the Italian proposal to convene a three- or four-power conference to discuss the Italian demands.

[Reuters London, 12th] The "Daily News" correspondent in Rome said, "Foreign diplomats stationed in Rome believe that Chamberlain's toast at the banquet was more sincere and complete than Mussolini's toast. Mussolini is now keeping his true intentions to himself. So far, the two men have agreed to pass matters of a moral nature in order to carry out some surprising things."

Grand Welcome

[Reuters Rome, 11th] Chamberlain and Halifax arrived here by special train from Genoa. They arrived at Rome Station at 4:25 pm (local time) yesterday. The station was newly decorated and dazzling. When the special train arrived at the station, the bugles sounded loudly. Mussolini and Ciano personally welcomed them and shook hands with Chamberlain and Halifax warmly. The crowd shouted loudly to express their joy. The Italian Grenadiers first played the British national anthem "God Save the King." The British expatriates on the scene sang loudly, almost drowning out the rhythm of the band. After the British national anthem was played, it was followed by the Italian national anthem. Mussolini arrived at the station ten minutes before the special train arrived, wearing a black coat of the Fascist Party military, surrounded by 30 guards of the musketeers. During the waiting period, Mussolini spoke freely with Sir Percy, the British Ambassador to Italy, Count Grandi, the Italian Ambassador to the UK, and the South African Minister to Italy, looking quite happy. The warm sunlight of the past few days has disappeared, and the sky is cloudy, but the climate is still good. Mr. Chamberlain still carried his famous umbrella, smiled, bowed to the welcomers, and waved his hat in greeting. After inspecting the guards of honor, he stepped into the waiting vehicle and drove to the famous Villa Madama for a rest amidst the cheers and waving flags. According to observers, no less than forty to fifty thousand people gathered on both sides of the station. After resting at Villa Madama for about twenty minutes, Chamberlain and Halifax took a car to the Quirinale Palace to sign the golden registration book. By 6:00 pm, the two men went to the Venetian Palace to attend Mussolini's reception. In the square outside the palace, crowds of no less than one hundred thousand people cheered in unison, and the situation was very warm. Chamberlain frequently waved his top hat in response. Because there were no military police present at the time, it seemed to be very sincere. The welcome of the citizens of Rome to Chamberlain and Halifax was a sincere expression, because the Italian government did not require the people to welcome them in advance in the newspapers. It can be seen that the people came spontaneously and voluntarily. Chamberlain and Halifax saved European peace in September last year, and the Italian people have not forgotten it.

Chamberlain's Speech

Chamberlain said at the banquet at the Venetian Palace, "Mr. Mussolini, you have expressed deep friendship to me personally and to the United Kingdom. I am very moved. Mr. Halifax and I are also deeply grateful for the warm welcome from the officials and people of Rome. We are very happy to revisit the new Italy and witness Italy's increasing strength and progress under Mr. Mussolini's guidance and influence. I am here today representing a great country, and this great country wholeheartedly hopes to maintain friendly and even close relations with another great country. Mr. Mussolini said that I was able to obtain a solution during the September incident last year, which is an overstatement. In fact, Mr. Mussolini made a contribution to the peaceful conclusion of the Munich Conference. We should be deeply grateful for his assistance and cooperation. My policy is to be friends with everyone and not to be enemies with anyone. The purpose of coming to Rome this time is nothing more than to practice this policy and seek a fair and peaceful solution to international problems through negotiation. It is gratifying that the governments of the United Kingdom and Italy can embody this policy in the Anglo-Italian Agreement. After the conclusion of the Anglo-Italian Agreement, the two governments began to exchange military intelligence, which is the first effect of the agreement. We firmly believe that the interests of the Mediterranean are of great importance to both countries, but there is no reason for conflict. The Anglo-Italian Agreement has opened a new era of friendship and trust between the two countries, and it will show its effectiveness for future stability. I hope that the two countries can cooperate with each other for the permanent peace of Europe." After Chamberlain finished his speech, he raised his glass to wish "His Majesty the King of Italy and His Majesty the Emperor of Abyssinia" a long life and hoped for the prosperity and prosperity of the Italian people.

Mussolini's Speech

Mr. Mussolini then stood up to return the toast to the health of Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Halifax, and warmly welcomed this "most popular guest, the representative of a great friendly country." He also said, "The Italian people express their sympathy for the efforts of Mr. Chamberlain and the British government. I still remember that in September last year, the fate of Europe was tied to the solution of several problems. Mr. Chamberlain personally went to mediate peace with a thorough and resolute spirit, and finally obtained a fair solution to the problem. Afterwards, he continued to work hard to follow a procedure of seeking understanding and peace, making repeated efforts and never giving up. Your spirit and perseverance have deeply moved our country, because our country has always believed that peace should be based on justice, and the policy of Fascist Italy is based on this as the ultimate goal. The recently implemented Anglo-Italian Agreement has placed Anglo-Italian relations on a solid foundation. This will not only rebuild the friendship between the two countries on the understanding achieved in the Mediterranean and Africa, but also open up the way for further cooperation between the two countries. This kind of cooperation is an essential element for European peace, and the people of Italy firmly hope that European peace will be maintained forever. I am deeply moved by your friendship." The attendees at the meeting were only Mussolini, Ciano, Chamberlain and Halifax. The atmosphere was very harmonious. Afterwards, it was heard that this first meeting was of a general nature and could be likened to "sightseeing." A continued meeting may be held at 5:00 pm tomorrow.

### German Military Reorganization Completed; After Annexing Austria and the Sudetenland, Strength Increases to Eighteen Army Corps; Shipbuilding Program Temporarily Inactive

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 12th] According to official reports, the German army, since its reorganization last year due to the situation, had a total of eighteen army corps by the end of the year, including thirty-nine infantry divisions, three mountain divisions, four light mechanized divisions, five mechanized divisions, one cavalry brigade, and multiple border guard units. The former Austrian army was organized into two divisions, the 17th and 18th, stationed in Kostermarkt, under the jurisdiction of the Fifth Military District in Vienna. The Sudetenland was incorporated into the nearby military district for suppression. The increase in manpower in the Sudetenland led to the formation of the 46th Division and a mechanized unit there. The headquarters of the 6th Army Corps is located in Hanover, the 14th in Magdeburg, the 15th in Jena, and the 16th in Limburg, for the sake of nearby command.

Before this batch of submarines is completed, new submarines cannot be started. The newspaper also stated, "German Führer Hitler estimates that it would be very appropriate for Germany to have one-third of the strength of the British Navy, because Germany does not want to conquer the colonies of North and South America and establish hegemony in the Mediterranean."

Brief Comments

### A Great Victory on the Northern Front

Our northern front, especially in Shanxi province, has won several major victories in the past few days, breaking the long-standing stalemate.

Starting in late December of last year, the Japanese, in coordination with the Konoe Declaration and Wang Jingwei's defection, launched a large-scale "Shanxi Sweep" war, on the one hand, attempting to take the opportunity to emphasize their "anti-communist" propaganda, and on the other hand, wanting to test our strength, and also wanting to take us by surprise and seize the base for attacking the Northwest. However, after two weeks of our heroic resistance, not only did the Japanese's attempt not succeed, but on the contrary, they suffered a serious blow from us. Important war zones in Shanxi, such as Jixian, Daning, Xiangning, and Puxian, were successively recovered by us. The Japanese army's fatalities accounted for one-tenth, and the number of wounded, scattered, and captured was countless. After this victory, the Japanese army's plan to invade Gansu will have to be completely changed. And the great strength of our Northwest military under the leadership of the consolidated united front has also been newly proven. This is the most glorious and important victory in our second phase of the war of resistance, and we must do everything in our power to protect and develop this victory, especially to consolidate the Jin-Cha-Ji border region, the anti-Japanese base in North China, to replenish the strength and equipment of the anti-Japanese troops in North China, to unify and link the command of the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare in North China, and to promote the excellent style of mutual trust and cooperation between the Central Army and the Eighth Route Army in North China under the united front policy to all war zones in the country!

### Crushing the Propaganda Tools of Capitulationists

Since the Central Government's decision to severely punish Wang Zhaoming, the traitorous party of capitulationists, for harming the country, the cultural circles in Chongqing and other places have launched a movement to clear out the propaganda tools of capitulationists in order to thoroughly stop all conspiracies that advocate ceasefire, pro-Japanese sentiments, undermine unity, and hinder progress. Now, Wang's words and deeds, which violate the public opinion of the entire country, can no longer be concealed, and it is said that the government has approved an order to arrest him and bring him to justice. For Wang himself, we can temporarily stop wasting words. However, Wang's secret activities, especially the intensified evil of his propaganda tools, cannot be ignored. On the one hand, because it is continuing to serve the Japanese invaders loyally, fabricating rumors, and sowing discord; its performance is almost exactly the same as that of Japanese newspapers; and on the other hand, because this kind of propaganda continues to hide under the shelter of "resistance," such as using "XX" to refer to "Japan," and even clearly advocating ceasefire and surrender, it will take advantage of phrases such as "tens of millions of displaced people" and put on the guise of "caring for the people's livelihood" in order to poison the people with its schemes. This kind of traitorous propaganda tool, which those with clear minds will certainly detest and despise, but for the sake of the general backward masses, we must appeal to the cultural circles in various places, especially the educators, to immediately be vigilant, to make accurate criticisms and denunciations, to rectify the discipline of the cultural and public opinion circles, to eliminate the few degenerates who are willing to be used by traitors, to persuade some deceived people to quickly turn back, and to strive together for justice, for progress, and for the final victory of the war of resistance and nation-building.

### A Review of the Work of the China Anti-Aggression Association in the Past Year (Continued)

— Yu Yan

However, in Europe, the branch set up a standing delegation, and in the past, they did a lot of work for the branch in promoting and liaising. However, of the five representatives, Tao Xingzhi and Wang Lixi have already returned to China, and we don't know if the work of the delegation there will be suspended because of this.

Now we can review the past year's propaganda work of the branch. Their work is divided into two spheres: internal and external. Objectively speaking, their work in both of these areas has not been done well enough. According to their work reports, on the internal side, they translated famous sayings and sound arguments from foreign newspapers and sent them to various newspapers in China for publication; they published two anti-aggression series and several pamphlets; they held anti-bombing rallies in Wuhan and various provinces and cities; they also received reporters from various countries who sympathized with China's war of resistance and came to China.

However, we must point out that the above-mentioned work is limited to the major cities in China, and it is limited to the upper classes in the major cities. Because China's newspaper industry is not developed at all, there are no local newspapers in the countryside, and the newspapers in the major cities have not been widely circulated in the countryside. Therefore, even if there are any famous sayings or great arguments, the people in the countryside simply have no chance to read them, let alone appreciate the possibility of their magnitude and limitations.

Originally, the series and pamphlets published by this association could have made up for this shortcoming. Because their prices are quite low and they are quite convenient to carry and transport. However, because the writing is dry and difficult, the workers and peasants, and even the small shop assistants, cannot accept them. In this way, their published books (including the translated articles reprinted in newspapers) are the same as the publications of ordinary large bookstores in China, and they can never flow to the lower classes. As for general welcome meetings, demonstration rallies, etc., their scope of activities is also limited to the cities, and the effect is naturally minimal!

The writer does not object to the approach of the branch, I only feel that its scope of activities is too limited, that it ignores the broad masses, and goes around in circles in the upper class society.

Regarding the external aspect, the association's work report lists nine items. Because of the domestic anti-aggression environment, although it is a small "nine," we dare not be too demanding, but what the writer wants to say is to offer a principle that we hope the branch will adopt. This principle is to concentrate manpower and financial resources on the collection of actual materials, such as the 1,200 photos collected by the association, which is a good example. However, the so-called "collection of physical objects" is not limited to photos. "Facts speak louder than words." May I ask what propaganda tool is more profound and more moving than physical objects?

(III) Prospects for the Future

In summary, we hope that the association will take advantage of the current stage of improvement in the international situation to launch a universal and in-depth anti-aggression movement throughout the country. Our working objects should be middle and primary school students and the general lower and middle classes who are only superficially literate. The so-called "well-known figures in society" are mostly unnecessary. The reasons are: (1) well-known figures in society do not necessarily have correct ideas, such as Wang Jingwei; (2) organizations with a celebrity-based approach often cannot flow to the lower classes. We still put forward an old saying: organizations should be from the bottom up. The reason why the branch's work has not had a great impact in the past, in my opinion, is very related to this point. We very much hope that the workers of the branch will consider this point.

In order to realize the idea of bottom-up, we hope that the branch will do more work on the two types of local organizations: district branches and liaison offices. The branch in the provincial capital is not very necessary. If the townships and cities are doing well, is there no way to deal with the provincial capital?

As for the direction of work outside the organization, we should make the people of the whole country realize the opposition of the two international walls. Today, when Wang Jingwei responds to Konoe's call for "joint anti-communism," we must expose the masks of the Japanese and its accomplices, Germany and Italy. We should clear out traitors and all kinds of seemingly correct theories internally. We should start from the board of directors of the branch and first clarify the situation and remove the elements who advocate taking the "German-Italian route." People have recalled their ambassadors, but we have a XX who is willing to lose face. Assuming that the Chinese branch does not quickly handle these tasks as soon as possible, then the words "International Anti-Aggression Movement" seem to be a bit "misapplied"!

I remember that when I met Mr. Zheng, we talked about the branch's attitude towards Germany and Italy. He said that of course we would not pay attention to them. —— If you are not a friend, you are an enemy, not to mention that they have all recognized Manchukuo and have actively helped Japan in its practical actions of invading our country!

### US President to Cruise the Atlantic, Inspect Naval Exercises

### Hong Kong Authorities Prepare for War; Expand Construction of Air Raid Shelters; Major Buildings Have Already Established Bomb Shelters and Intensified Anti-Gas Equipment; Plans to Evacuate Hong Kong Residents When Necessary are Under Consideration

As international winds become increasingly dangerous, in addition to strengthening military preparations, countries are also actively engaged in air defense movements. Therefore, the British government specially sent Steel-Brooke-Kins to Hong Kong to serve as the Director of Air Defense. Since taking office, he has been actively implementing air defense arrangements. In addition to holding two air defense exercises, he has also organized various air defense posts, appointed air defense inspectors, and trained air defense rescuers. Yesterday morning, this reporter visited Mr. Steel and asked about Hong Kong's air defense equipment. His responses are as follows: [Reporter] Is the government building gas shelters and air raid shelters to allow residents to take refuge? [Steel] The government has approved the large-scale construction of air raid shelters. As for residences with gardens, it is also appropriate to build them themselves in case of emergencies. [Question] What kind of air defense plan does the government plan to adopt? [Answer] The experience is derived from China and Spain. During bombings, civilians suffer more from bullets and falling objects. The number of people killed or injured by direct bombing is one in ten thousand. [Question] Will the government order private houses that are suitable for being bombed to be opened to civilians for refuge? [Answer] Yes, it is already underway, inspecting various suitable houses. [Question] Are the major buildings in Hong Kong, such as the Shanghai Bank and the Gloucester Hotel, suitable for refuge? [Answer] The above-mentioned buildings have all established basements and bomb shelters for the use of staff and guests. [Question] Will the number of air raid shelters in the future be able to supply all Hong Kong residents? [Answer] It is difficult to determine the increase or decrease of the population. According to statistics, each acre of land can build an air raid shelter that can accommodate 1,250 people. It is predicted that in the event of an emergency, in addition to evacuating the population as much as possible, and adding sturdy buildings, the number of air raid shelters will be limited. [Question] In the event of an emergency, is it better to stay indoors or gather in air raid shelters? [Answer] It is better to stay at home. [Question] Are the construction of gas shelters and bomb shelters by residences and shops paid for by themselves or does the government provide subsidies? [Answer] Air defense equipment should be borne by private individuals. If it is an industrial center, the government may consider providing economic subsidies. [Question] Are the major commercial firms and factories in Hong Kong jointly building gas shelters or bomb shelters? [Answer] Indeed, it is necessary for all shops that employ more than 100 employees to cooperate. The government has also instructed the principals of various commercial firms to pay attention. [Question] How much does it cost to build a gas shelter or a bomb shelter? [Answer] The equipment for a gas shelter costs no more than one dollar. If you build your own air raid shelter, which is about ten feet long and can accommodate six people, it will cost 600 yuan. [Question] Are there any completed air raid shelters in Hong Kong now? [Answer] The ones built by the government are not yet available, but there are already several private ones. [Question] What about gas masks? [Answer] The government has paid close attention to the supply of gas masks. [Question] Will the government force the construction of gas shelters when approving building plans in the future? [Answer] This depends on the engineers. The authorities have advised them to add basements and gas shelters when designing. Government houses under construction all have this equipment. [Question] How to deal with crowded locations in the event of an emergency? [Answer] In addition to vigorously implementing evacuation, take refuge in air raid shelters and place sandbags on various streets to reduce the danger of bullet fragments flying in all directions. [Question] Is there a plan to evacuate the Chinese to the New Territories and nearby small islands when necessary? [Answer] The entire evacuation plan is currently under consideration. [Question] Are there designated places specifically for British women and children to take refuge? [Answer] Not yet. [Question] What is the best way to put out incendiary bombs? [Answer] The method of putting out incendiary bombs has been announced some time ago. According to experiments in the UK, each incendiary bomb can continue to burn for ten to twelve minutes if it is not extinguished. If extinguished by appropriate methods, it can be extinguished in two minutes. The method of extinguishing should avoid water. The simplest method is to extinguish it with sand. The weight of the incendiary bomb is not large, and it is dropped from an airplane. It can only penetrate the roof and fall into the room. At this time, it is advisable to quickly remove the inflammable objects. [Question] If the fire brigade encounters a large fire in four places, can it send people to rescue at the same time? [Answer] The fire brigade has intensified training in this regard. [Question] How many alarm bells are there in Hong Kong now? [Answer] There are fourteen in total. The signal sent will be an emergency intermittent sound wave for three minutes. The relief signal is also three minutes, but the sound wave is stable and uninterrupted. The Hong Kong Air Defense Department has also scheduled to release incendiary bombs at the Volunteer Force Headquarters at 11:45 am tomorrow and instruct the Air Defense Women's Association on how to put them out.

### The Shenzhen Reception Center's Relief Work Gradually Becomes Disciplined; Facilities Are Increasingly Complete; Over Two Thousand Refugees Are Housed in Four Reception Centers; the Facilities Inside Are Quite Complete, and Medical Care and Medicine Are Provided

The Hong Kong Community Relief Committee for South China Refugees will move all refugees in the New Territories to the Shenzhen Reception Center for unified relief. Through the committee's efforts in recent days, various facilities in the center have become increasingly complete, and relief work has gradually become disciplined. Yesterday, the reporter and the person in charge of the committee went to Shenzhen to inspect everything. The current handling situation and various construction progress in the center are recorded as follows:

Two Thousand Refugees in Four Reception Centers

The Shenzhen Reception Center was initially handled by the Emergency Refugee Relief Committee. Due to time constraints, all facilities were simple, and the number of people was small. Later, the Hong Kong government authorities entrusted the Joint Relief Committee of All Sectors to manage it. The committee's relief team then actively built berths and gradually moved refugees from various stations in the New Territories. Now, the center has been completely arranged and organized. There are a total of four reception centers that have begun to house refugees, with a total of more than two thousand people. The management of refugees is very orderly. The refugees' residences are divided into men, women, and families, and chaos is not allowed to maintain order. The first of the four centers is the largest. The site is the former site of the Shenzhen Theater. The ground floor and the second floor have extremely large spaces. Currently, more than 500 berths for men and women have been built, accommodating more than a thousand refugees.

The Facilities in the Center Are Quite Complete

The layout of the center is extremely clean, with ample light and air. Two refugees share a bed, and the straw mats and cotton quilts are very comfortable. The second center is located at the former site of the Qinhuai Restaurant, the third is the unfinished shop of the Yousheng Company, and the fourth is the former site of the Chaoran Pavilion, which can accommodate about three to four hundred people. All layouts are the same as the first center. Each center is equipped with a manager to be responsible for all affairs of the center. The fifth reception center is currently being arranged, and the location is the former site of the Yousheng Company's staff dormitory. The house is quite spacious and has two floors. More than 200 berths have now been built, which can accommodate more than 200 people. There is still space nearby that can be continuously arranged, but the relief team has temporarily set up five centers because the number of refugees moving in from the New Territories has not been crowded. Some of the above-mentioned houses were destroyed by the No. 92 typhoon disaster the year before last, and have been completely repaired, so refugees can avoid the suffering of wind and sun during their stay. The accommodation situation has been described above. Regarding clothing, refugees wear only single clothes and thin trousers when they enter the center. When the weather is severe in the past few days, the committee will distribute cotton clothes. Many groups have donated cotton clothes to the center in the past few days, so there are plenty of cotton clothes, and the refugees are no longer in danger of being cold.

Building a Dining Hall and Serving Meat for Dinner

Regarding the supply of food, refugees are usually supplied with two meals of rice and vegetables a day. Those who are sick and cannot eat rice can replace it with sweet potatoes or rice noodles. Due to time constraints, there were no dining hall facilities before. Refugees had two meals a day, only on the open space next to the theater and on the embankment of the small river, eating on mats on the ground. In the past few days, construction has started on building a sunflower shed in the square, and half of it has been completed yesterday. The area is extremely wide. After the dining hall is completed, it can accommodate 40 tables, about 4,000 people. There are plans to build long wooden tables and chairs there so that refugees can rest. Because the places in the center have been abandoned for a long time and no one has cleaned them, there are piles of abandoned wood everywhere. The manager has actively cleaned them and selected those who are strong among the refugees who stay to take on this kind of work, and pay them wages appropriately. The place has gradually become clean.

Setting up a Free Clinic and Starting to Dispense Medicine

The medical problem in the reception center has now been solved. Refugees who are sick are treated by Chinese and Western medicine. A part of the upstairs of the first center has been designated as a temporary ward, which is responsible by the ambulance team. There are more than a dozen beds in the temporary ward. The light and air in the room are particularly good, so that sick refugees can recuperate. Those with more serious illnesses will be sent to the temporary hospital of the St. John Ambulance Brigade of Yousheng Company for medical treatment. Regarding Chinese medicine, active arrangements have been made in the past few days and have been completed. The location of the free clinic and medicine dispensing center has been selected as three houses next to the police station. Medicine stoves and medicine cabinets have been prepared. The doctor who will be responsible for the service will arrive at the center today and can start providing free medical treatment and medicine. The ground floor is divided into a consultation room, a waiting room, and a medicine drinking room. The second floor is a Chinese medicine hospital, so that refugees with more serious illnesses can stay in the center for medical treatment.

Water and Electricity Facilities and Fire Protection Will Be Provided

The water supply in the center is still taken from nearby well water, but transportation is extremely inconvenient. The Joint Relief Committee has previously negotiated with the Hong Kong government to connect water pipes from the New Territories to supply drinking water. The water machine has now arrived and will be installed in about a week. Electric lights have been installed and supplied yesterday. The most urgent problem to be solved in the center at the moment is fire protection. All things in the center are flammable. At this time when the north wind is blowing and the weather is dry, it is most likely to cause a fire. There is also a lack of water sources. If we do not find a way to prevent it, it would be unimaginable if an accident occurred. The committee has now paid attention to this point. In addition to strictly prohibiting refugees from smoking and making fires in the center, it is also planning temporary fire protection equipment. It will collect a large number of water buckets and fire extinguishers from enthusiastic people from all walks of life in preparation for rescue in case of fire. In addition, the committee also posted wall newspapers in the center to report war news, the general situation of the association, and communication between refugee relatives and friends. It hopes to set up a reading room within the possible scope and hopes that people from all walks of life will donate various newspapers and magazines to relieve the refugees' loneliness.

### Hong Kong's 98th Anniversary of Cession! Hong Kong Officials Are Preparing to Celebrate the Centennial Anniversary on January 25, 1941

The Hong Kong government announced yesterday that January 25, 1941, is the Centennial Anniversary of the opening of Hong Kong. It is learned that Hong Kong was captured by British Commander Elliot on August 23, 1839 (this year is the Centennial Anniversary), but it was not formally ceded to the British until the Opium War in 1841. According to the research of Hong Kong historians, based on the report of British Commander 　德華at the time, it was determined that the Centennial Anniversary would be on the 25th. The report is recorded as follows: "Our army landed at 8:15 am on January 25, 1841. All officers and generals raised their glasses to remotely wish our Emperor. The next day, the entire fleet arrived and raised our flag." The Hong Kong government authorities are now discussing with Hong Kong celebrities to prepare to celebrate this important anniversary, but there is still no organizing committee. After asking the British capital authorities for instructions, they will actively proceed. At the same time, the Centennial History of Hong Kong will be carried out this year. The history has been drafted by the former Secretary of Education, Mr. Shaw, and is now undertaken by Mr. 祝德of the Central British Boys' School. In the future, the British capital may send a member of the British royal family to Hong Kong to participate in the celebration.

### Hong Kong Authorities Prepare for a Population Census to Be Held Once Every Ten Years; the Expected Minimum Is 1.25 Million People

The population census in the United Kingdom and its territories is usually held once every ten years. Hong Kong will hold it in 1941. According to reliable sources yesterday, the preparations for this matter are now underway. It is learned that the last population census in Hong Kong was held at 12:00 pm on Saturday, March 7, 1931. At that time, the person in charge of this matter was 　利, the current Secretary for Chinese Affairs. The survey items were (1) the names of all residents in the house, (2) the relationship with the household, (3) whether they were married, widowed, or divorced, (4) age and gender, (5) nationality and place of birth, (6) ethnicity, (7) time of residence in Hong Kong, (8) level of education, (9) occupation. However, this time, in accordance with the instructions of the Court of Colonial Affairs, the survey items will be broader than the last time, in order to understand the level of education of children over five years old, and what percentage of the population can write and read their native language or English. Also, according to the last survey results, the general population of Hong Kong was 821,492. Due to the war this time, it is believed that the minimum will reach 1.25 million people.

### Connecting Emotions, Reviewing Work; A Record of a Gathering of Young Reporters

— 奇車

Mr. Tao Xingzhi Talks About the New Guangxi in the War of Resistance

A Glimpse of the Venue

The restaurant of the Great Eastern Hotel, with glass mirrors on both sides reflecting each other, seems to enlarge the venue dozens of times. The crystal-clear electric lights, the snow-white tablecloths, the still cutlery, the active members... everything is reflected in the glass mirror. This "diverse world in the mirror" is as interesting as the diverse society seen by reporters.

After signing in, everyone started talking as soon as they met. Although everyone is a fellow colleague, they are all busy, and getting together for a pleasant chat is a rare opportunity. Some are meeting for the first time, new partners. It is also a strange and interesting pleasure to go from the spiritual friendship and imagination on the newspaper to the friendly association and conversation in person. Last night, the Young Reporters Association held its first New Year's gathering and dinner in this beautiful and lively environment.

Attendees

More than 50 people attended, including Jin Zhonghua, Guo Butao, Liu Simu浮, and Wang Jiyuan. The newspaper offices they belonged to included Shen Bao, 星　Daily, Ta Kung Pao, Li Pao, Pearl River Daily, 大衆日报, and Hua Chiao Yat Po. The news agencies they belonged to included: Central News Agency, News Agency, 民革社, and 大陆社. There were only three women, three long gowns, and only three Zhongshan suits. This is Hong Kong, and most people are dressed in suits and leather shoes. The women, long gowns, and Zhongshan suits that attracted attention in the venue were very interesting and related to the number "three".

Although the name is Young Reporters, in fact, there are quite a few people in the news industry with a long history and experienced seniors. Mr. Guo Butao is one of the old seniors in the news industry, and one of the members sitting opposite the reporter is an old man with a bald head.

"Youth" Is the Age of Thought, Not the Physiological Age

Young people respect the old and cherish the wise, as long as the elders can trust and guide the young people. At the beginning of the meeting ceremony, everyone unanimously elected Mr. Guo Butao, the editor-in-chief of this newspaper who was not forced by × people's forces, as chairman. Mr. Guo's humble resignation × however, the warm hall sound ran to the chairman's seat. - The "youth" of young reporters should be the age of thought, not the physiological age, which is also a concrete explanation here.

Mr. Guo explained in his speech that this dinner has two meanings:

One is to connect emotions and review work:

The second is to welcome Mr. Tao Xingzhi and invite Mr. Tao to give a lecture, so that we can have a further understanding of the current situation at home and abroad.

Next, Mr. Tan Siwen reported on the association's affairs on behalf of the board of directors of the Young Reporters Association.

Report on Association Affairs

Mr. Tan said that the association has done the following important work since its establishment more than two months ago: (A) Held two board meetings and held standing meetings every week; (B) The preparation of the training institute for news workers will be successful; (C) The publication of週　has been published in two issues; (D) Organized a war zone interview team and a war zone newspaper supply team, (E) Academic research is divided into five groups: editing, writing, interviewing, sports, and art, which members can freely choose to participate in. He also attached the difficulties in the development of the association's affairs and the hopes for the members.

Mr. Tao Xingzhi's Speech

In the warm applause, Mr. Tao began his popular and meaningful speech.

Mr. Tao said calmly: "This year is worth being happy and rejoicing. First, the Hengshan Conference decided that: politics is more important than military affairs, the rear is more important than the front, the people are more important than the soldiers, and guerrilla warfare is more important than regular warfare. This is really a sign of China's resurrection.

Second, the Anglo-American loan was successful, Roosevelt's ability to oppose aggression is becoming more active, and the Neutrality Act will be amended.

Third, 汪精衛 this 　　has been eliminated, the blood of our Chinese nation has been cleared, and no one can make trouble in politics, so we can unanimously deal with foreign countries.

Fourth, your association's work and spirit are very meaningful and full of progress. Your evergreen symbolizes the eternal green of the Chinese nation.

The above four things are all very happy and rejoicing to us. Now, I will report to you the good phenomena that I have seen and heard in Guangxi in the past month. .

First, after × bombing Guilin, the people of Guangxi not only did not lose heart, but also strengthened their determination to resist ×

Second, Guangxi has a population of 13 million, and 400,000 soldiers have been sent to fight against ×. If all provinces in the country follow the proportion of Guangxi, the country will have 14 million soldiers who can fight against ×　　, and the territory will definitely be complete.

Third, after General Bai 　禧 brought the essence of the Hengshan Conference back to Guangxi, Guangxi showed a more vigorous atmosphere. In the political aspect, in addition to the village representative assembly in the past, the township and town representative assembly was held at the end of December. After the establishment of the county temporary council at the end of February, the provincial council will be established. The director of the Provincial Civil Affairs Department said: People without organization are like people without people. Guangxi's politics has been advancing on the road of democratization.

Fourth, the operation of Guangxi's politics is very rapid. After the Dasen bombing, there were notices everywhere guiding the people where to stay, where to receive money, and where to eat... This is a rare phenomenon in other places. If you don't help each other in times of trouble, you will be punished by law.

Fifth: When fleeing, young people should help the old and young. Each traffic station is equipped with tea and rice to facilitate the evacuation of the population. Those who do not believe it will go from suspicion to admiration after on-site inspection.

Sixth: The economic aspect pays great attention to production. The province's main product is tung oil. 60% to 70% of it is shipped to the United States every year. Now the authorities limit each county to plant 3,000 plants, each village should plant 2,000 plants, and each township should cut 1,000 plants to increase production.

Seventh: The foundation of national education is generally and grandly covered in all places. The principal, village chief, and regimental leader are three in one.

Eighth: The rapid completion of the Xiang-Gui Railway is beyond words.

Ninth: Discover from mountain education:

Go to the common people,

Lead the common people;

Go like escaping,

Come back and fight back.

- This is the principle of mass education during the war.

Tenth, what is even more gratifying is that your association members, young reporters - many people live together in Guangxi like a family; they have a plan to seek knowledge and progress, like a wartime school. They encourage each other, like a service team. This is a very good phenomenon.

I now have a purpose, which is to report the benefits of various places to encourage colleagues to do good and get rid of evil, such as the charity sale in Hong Kong, the patriotic child "Li Guoping" and about Zhao Lao　太... etc., will also be brought to other places to promote..." After Mr. Tao finished speaking, the audience responded with a burst of warm applause.

Responding to the Debt Repayment Campaign and the Theory of Sanctioning Traitors

After Mr. Tao's speech, there was a discussion. Mentioned responding to the one-yuan debt repayment, and more than 60 yuan was raised on the spot. The denunciation of 衛's treason and the theory of sanctioning traitors also aroused heated discussions.

It's getting late, call out goodbye, and leave happily. Everyone returned to their posts and took on the sacred work of "manufacturing" today's "spiritual food" in Hong Kong.

### Two Fishing Boats on the Sam Mun Chau Sea Were Robbed Again; One Was Robbed and Its Whereabouts Are Unknown; the Whereabouts of Two of the Crew Members Are Also Unknown

Recently, × warships and armed fishing boats have frequently wreaked havoc on our fishing boats in the waters off Damgan Island and Sam Mun Chau. In the past ten days, as many as ten boats have been robbed by them. Unexpectedly, on the 10th of this month, another扒艇 was taken away by a × iron tugboat in the waters off Sam Mun Chau. Thirty people on board were brutally ravaged. Only 28 people were able to 　survive. Two people were still drifting at sea and their whereabouts are unknown. The boat owner returned to Hong Kong yesterday to report to the Fishermen's Advancement Association. The stolen扒艇 was No. 565HA, and the boat owner was Li Shengli. He left Hong Kong to go fishing at 1:00 am on November 20th of the lunar calendar (ie January 10th of the Gregorian calendar). Unfortunately, at 5:00 pm, when passing through the west of the Sam Mun Chau sea, a × iron tugboat suddenly came head-on with a fierce momentum. Li wanted to raise his sails and escape at this time, but he was eventually caught up by the × tugboat. Li and others shrank back and did not speak. When × threw himself close to Li's boat, he immediately threatened to drive 30 people on board down to the three small sampans, and then took away Li's 扒艇. The three small sampans drifted with the waves, and after several hours, they drifted to the nearby sea. They were rescued by a Xingzhan boat (boat owner Liang Fangfeng, 452HA), so they used a sampan to carry 14 people to Tap Mun, and another 14 people to Hong Kong. Some of them have returned to Cheung Chau, and the remaining six people will stay in Hong Kong to wait for relief. Another small boat with an unnumbered number, carrying Li Gen and Li Bing, was also robbed by × at the same time in the waters off Sam Mun Chau. Every time the sea is 　, eight boats are scattered and displaced. How the situation is now is still unknown. The boat owner drove back to Hong Kong at noon yesterday and reported to the Shau Kei Wan branch.

Transportation and Travel

### Gushan in Fuzhou (3)

— Shao Yanqing

White Cloud Cave is located at the northern end of Gushan, only seven or eight li away from the summit. Among the eighteen caves of Gushan, it is said to be the best. We followed the original path down the peak, passed the Guanyin Bodhisattva stone we had just seen, and turned towards the western side of Qianhuai. Scattered pebbles covered the hillside. After walking for less than half a li, the pebbles disappeared, leaving only barren, uninhabited yellow earth hills. Presumably, eager to finish lunch, everyone lowered their heads and hurried forward, climbing up and down, unknowingly crossing several hills. Gradually, the clear and verdant field scenery unfolded. From the thatched huts along the road came bursts of the scent of leaf stalks, as if reminding me that this was a small village. Our journey stopped in front of a white bungalow. It faced west with its back to the east, and had only a small door in the front. Above the door was a horizontal inscription of four characters: "White Cloud Crouching Hermitage." The layout of the hermitage was simple, with a rural flavor. Entering through the small door was a spacious hall. At either end of the hall were monastic rooms and a kitchen. In the middle of the hall, there was a glass shrine, in front of which were placed a wooden table and four benches. There was nothing else. It was already past noon, and the slanting sun shone through the cracks in the door, illuminating the entire room. We ate some sweet potatoes and vegetables freshly picked from the garden in the hermitage. Looking out from the door, we saw the fields, thatched huts, and vast distant mountains reflecting in the autumn sun. At that moment, the life of the farmers added boundless poetic and artistic feelings to my heart.

Leaving White Cloud Crouching Hermitage, it was already past two o'clock. The mountain gradually changed from flat to rugged. In many places, the road was built on the edge of cliffs. Scattered strange rocks were piled on one side, some seemingly unable to support their own weight, threatening to tumble down. On the other side was a deep valley hundreds of zhang deep, a perilous situation. Fortunately, some of the cliffs were covered with wild grass and trees, obscuring the dangerous scenery and giving us tourists boundless comfort. As we approached halfway, there was a rock about ten zhang high by the roadside. On the rock were the four characters "Wind-moved Falcon." At the top of the rock was a large, grayish stone, shaped like a startled crow perched, with a vivid form.

Continuing forward, we passed Shuofa Terrace, Tengyun Cave, Qinglong Cave, Haiyin Cave, and others. The mountain path along the way twisted and turned, rising and falling. At times, it gradually ascended, and looking out, the mountains and rivers were vast and indistinct. At other times, it gradually descended, with mountain peaks on both sides, and strange rocks towering. The most captivating part was the stone steps leading to Haiyin Cave, with towering rocks on both sides, covered with weeds and trees. We supported ourselves with bamboo canes and climbed step by step under the intertwined branches and leaves. Arriving at Haiyin Cave, we saw that the door of the cave was tightly closed. Above the door was a horizontal plaque with the three characters "Galandha Hall." Peeking through the wooden grid, we saw that there was no one inside. After lingering at the entrance for a while, we descended to White Cloud Cave. This was a narrow stone staircase. On the right stood a large, unparalleled high rock, with many branches, leaves, and flowers growing out of the rock soil. On the left, the cliff was covered with dense forests. The layers of purple-green colors, after being illuminated by the sunlight, became various shades of light and dark, reflecting on our faces and clothes, forming a beautiful natural picture. After passing this section of stone steps shaded by flowers and trees, we zigzagged downwards for about dozens of steps, and saw a white house built against the cliff. As soon as the sunlight was blocked by the mountain wall, the scene suddenly became gloomy. Several bamboo groves were sparsely arranged by the roadside, as if foretelling that this was a secluded and extraordinary place. This rock house was White Cloud Cave.

We stepped in through a small side door, passed through the kitchen and bedroom, and arrived at the Buddha hall. This Buddha hall was not very large, but because of its simple layout and bright, open windows, it felt spacious on all sides. In the center of the wall at the back was a Buddha shrine. In addition to Guanyin, Galandha, and Weituo, there was also a golden statue made of flesh, said to be the Chan master Wuzong, who opened up White Cloud Cave. Above the shrine was a horizontal plaque with the four characters "Protect the People." A dimly lit glass lamp hung from the top, just above the Buddha shrine. In addition, on the rocks on both sides of the shrine were inscribed the phrases "Doctor in the Deep" and "Eternal Bliss, True Self, Purity." On the left side of the wall was a couplet that read, "In the deep and secluded green mountains, white clouds conceal the cave." Being in this quiet mountain valley and reading these moving sentences made one feel an infinite sense of loneliness and emptiness. In front of the hall was a small patio. Standing in the patio, one could see the three characters "Conscience" written on the lintel of the door. According to this name, the meaning is profound. During this national crisis, it seems necessary for the monks and nuns of our country to come here to reflect.

Passing through this Buddha hall was a triangular stone platform. The rocks covering it from above and supporting it from below had reached their end. Walking here, one suddenly realized that the rooms one had just passed through were built in the crevices between the two rocks. Standing on the stone platform and looking out at the high mountains opposite, they seemed to be right in front of one's eyes. One could see thousands of cliffs and valleys rising straight up, the kind of majestic and towering aura that even the summit peak paled in comparison to. The most interesting thing was that the foot of the mountain opposite and the foot of the mountain on our side connected, forming a secluded and extraordinary mountain valley. As a result, a sharp sound emitted from this side of the stone platform echoed four or five times in the mountain valley. It is said that setting off firecrackers here can produce more than ten echoes. Unfortunately, we had not thought of it beforehand and were unable to try it. The rock walls inside the stone platform were engraved with many moving phrases, such as "Buddha Cave Immortal Terrace," "Suspended in the Air," "Thousands of Rocks Competing in Beauty," "Ten Thousand Valleys Striving to Flow," "Cloud Sea Pine Waves," "Echoes in the Empty Valley," "Pillow High on White Clouds," etc. The handwriting was vigorous and refined, adding much color to the rocks.

### Proclamation from the Shipping Administration Office

Yesterday, the Shipping Administration Office issued a proclamation stating that on the 15th of this month, underwater cables would be repaired at Stonecutter's Island in the West Ring Bay. At that time, boats and barges would be hired for the work. All vessels passing through the area should pay attention to slowing down.

### Special Shipping Report

The Glen Line, represented by Jardine Matheson Shipping Company in this port, travels to the West, London, Tianjin, Durban, Hamburg, Venice, Singapore, Colombo, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Japan, and other places. Each month, one or two vessels arrive in port. Recently, the company has considered that with the increase in traffic on the Far East route, it is necessary to add more vessels. Therefore, it has commissioned the Taikoo Dockyard in this port to build two new vessels, and has ordered six more in England. The new vessels will be of new design and will be capable of sailing at a rate of eighteen nautical miles per hour. It is currently known that the Breconshire, which is being built at the Taikoo Dockyard, will be launched on February 3. The other vessel, the Glenochy, will also be completed soon. As for the several vessels ordered in England, they may begin sailing east one after another in the first half of this year. It is reported that the construction cost of these new vessels is approximately eight million pounds.

### Ships from Macau to Hong Kong No Longer Need to Enter Quarantine Waters

(Special Interview) The Hong Kong authorities, in order to actively prevent the spread of cholera, previously required ships from Macau to enter quarantine waters for inspection before being released. According to news from yesterday, ships from Macau to Hong Kong no longer need to enter quarantine waters. This will reduce a lot of trouble for people traveling between Hong Kong and Macau.

### Returning from Changsha (3)

— Lü Dongren

Nanning was formerly the capital of Guangxi Province. As soon as we arrived at the station, our luggage was unloaded, and we registered our names at the inspection point. Then, we were thoroughly inspected and questioned by the police and soldiers. They questioned us two young men particularly carefully, probably because young men were not allowed to leave the country. After tidying up the luggage that had been messed up during the inspection, we went to a hotel to check in, took a bath, ate a bowl of wontons, and rested. Not long after, two policemen came and inspected our tidied-up luggage again. They came and went like a whirlwind. We just smiled, not surprised, and answered their questions sympathetically. Finally, they left, knowing that we were pure. Although this was so troublesome for us, it was also their duty. The streets of Nanning were very clean, and the buildings were well-constructed. Lush trees were planted on both sides of the road, and the air was fresh, making people feel happy and refreshed. Another point worth emulating is that everyone should observe cleanliness and not litter the streets. Therefore, there were waste bins placed by the roadside for pedestrians to dispose of their garbage. There were many large bookstores here. We went to the Cangwu Bookstore and bought two or three books. The owner of the Cangwu Bookstore was an old friend of my brother. We only found out about this through conversation. There were no publications published here, only the Quanmian Zhan and Nanning Daily. We stayed there for a day. The next evening, we took a steamer to Longzhou. Originally, there were buses available, but at this time, all the vehicles were used for military transport.

The third-class fare from Nanning to Longzhou was only three yuan, but meals were not included. We did not initially know that the steamer also had to tow wooden boats, so the progress was very slow. The crew told us that it would take four days and nights to arrive. How could we pass such a long time of four days and nights? Fortunately, we bought some books in Nanning, and we read to pass the time when we were bored. The passengers on the boat were very crowded. Among these unfamiliar passengers, we got to know two friends through conversation. One was named Li, who had fled from Guangzhou. The other was an Englishman, who had lived in Nanning for a long time. He had pharmacies in Guangzhou, Hankou, and other places. He and his wife went to Hong Kong to avoid the war. The steamer was laboriously moving slowly in the rapid river. Sometimes, because the water was too strong, the steamer's turning power was insufficient, so four or five more crew members had to be added, using poles and exerting force to help the steamer move forward. Almost every day, we had to exert such effort several times. On both sides of the river were stone mountains, the stones being formed by layers upon layers, which we had never seen before. We stopped at several small market towns along the way. Some passengers disembarked at these small market towns, but the few of us went all the way to Longzhou.

It was a clear and sunny morning when we arrived in Longzhou. After disembarking, our luggage was inspected. Mr. Li, whom we had just met, went back to his own home. The English friend also went to another place. Only Mr. Yang and the two of us stayed at a hotel. Longzhou is a small town, with a small river flowing through the middle of the town, dividing it into east and west banks. A sturdy iron bridge was built in the center of the river. There was a French consulate here. In addition to the French consul, there were Chinese and Vietnamese staff working there. There were very few bookstores, only one or two used bookstores. The cultural aspect was naturally not worth mentioning. There were only primary schools, but the general public's anti-Japanese sentiment was very high. Street cartoons and anti-Japanese slogans could be seen everywhere. There was a Zhongshan Park here, with beautiful trees and flowers. There was a natural stone pavilion in the pond, where people could go for a stroll. There were vendors selling food in the park, and a sports field for visitors to do various exercises. But what we did not see were the birds and animals. Now, let's talk about obtaining a passport to go to Annam. Who would have thought that this passport would give us a great difficulty. When we arrived at the Governor's Office, the officials asked us very strictly, because we were two young men, so they paid special attention. Finally, they said that we had to have a local shop as a guarantor in order to obtain a passport. We were at a loss. How could we find someone who would be our guarantor for life? We hardly knew anyone there. Who knew what kind of people we were? Who would trust us and take on such a heavy and life-related responsibility to guarantee us? Just as we were in a dilemma and had no way out, we thought of someone, Mr. Li, who was on the same boat as us. He said he was a local, so we went to his house to try. We told Mr. Li everything frankly. After accepting our request, he immediately took his seal and went with us to the Governor's Office. Mr. Li was very reputable in Longzhou, so he solved this great difficulty for us. Although Mr. Li was a friend we had met only once, a casual acquaintance, he was able to disregard his own heavy responsibility and do his best to help his friend in need, which was truly admirable. This passport, which was only a few pages long, cost us seven yuan, six yuan to the Governor's Office and four yuan to the French Consulate for signatures. At the same time, we had to attach four two-and-a-half-inch photos. Only then did we complete all the procedures. We were delayed for three days because of obtaining a passport. On the morning of November 4, we left Longzhou and headed for Lang Son in Annam.

From Longzhou to Lang Son, we took a bus, which cost only three yuan. The seats were very good, but when boarding the bus, the luggage had to be inspected by customs. The gentle morning breeze blew against our faces, and we felt very comfortable. This section of the road was full of high mountains and steep ridges. The road was narrow and uneven, winding and twisting. When two cars met, they could hardly pass. At one point, we were almost buried in a mountain pit, ending our two little lives. A car was coming from the front. Because neither side saw each other, the two cars collided. Fortunately, the driver was agile enough to save the lives of twenty or thirty people. After a short drive, we arrived at Zhennanguan. This was just a small town wall running horizontally. The place was not very big, and there were police and soldiers guarding it. After passing Zhennanguan, there was a customs checkpoint for passengers and luggage leaving for Vietnam. Here, there were French and Vietnamese officials, which marked the border between China and Vietnam. As soon as we left this place, we felt an endless sense of emotion. By arriving here, we were separated from our motherland. This was our temporary departure. We must work harder in this departure. Everything in this foreign land was not unfamiliar to us. Although we had not been to Lang Son or Hanoi, we could understand the language of the foreign land very well. Because the language was not a barrier, there were no troubles in various matters. After the luggage was inspected, we continued to move forward. We arrived in Lang Son at noon that day.

Because the Chinese hotels were all full, they were all high-class refugees who had fled from the country. Many of them went to Yunnan after Hanoi. We had to stay at an Annam hotel. Lang Son is a Qingya small city, with lush trees planted on both sides of the street. The air is fresh and the roads are wide. The French people pay great attention to the construction of the local area. Most of the business of Lang Son is controlled by Vietnamese. There are very few overseas Chinese. We stayed there for one night. The next morning, we took the train to Hanoi. The train was covered with dust, which was the coal stove ejected from the front of the car. Looking along the way, there were vast fields and thatched huts inhabited by farmers. This was obviously a rural scene in Vietnam. We arrived in Hanoi at one o'clock that afternoon. When we were about to arrive, people from the Tianran Hotel came to greet us. All the luggage was moved up to the hotel by the hotel for us. The Tianran Hotel has been there for a long time. He specializes in those passengers who come from home or Hong Kong. The hospitality is OK, but the price is slightly expensive.

### After the Ministry of Finance reorganized the transit tax, it increased to more than 50 million last year. Although it was in the midst of the fierce Sino-Japanese War, it still increased by more than double compared to the previous year.

After the transit tax was reorganized by the Ministry of Finance, tax revenue increased significantly. Although 1938 was in the midst of the fierce Sino-Japanese War and trade between China and foreign countries declined, the transit tax was still better than the previous year. According to statistics from the Inspectorate General of Customs, the total transit tax for all ports in the country was 55.84 million yuan, an increase of 35.69 million yuan over the 20.15 million yuan of the previous year, more than doubling.

[Our Correspondent] The north wind blows across the wild, its color entering the border landscape. In these days, Hong Kong, which lives forever in its mountains and rivers, has lost its mildness and taken on a cold face.

The stronger the north wind, the more intense the football affairs in this "Shangri-La." Let me tell you that the preliminary round of the Li Wah Cup football competition, where four teams contend for the championship, will be held next weekend.

On the 21st, the Western Civil Servants United team will play against the Army United team at the Kowloon grounds. On the 22nd, the Chinese United team will play against the Navy United team at the Hong Kong grounds. It is believed that these two major events will cause a sensation.

The China United representatives have already been selected. However, South China is on tour in Vietnam and will not return in time. With the key battle imminent, thoughts turn to the traveling players. Therefore, only two South China players have been selected for the team: Leung Wing-chiu and Tam Kwan-kan, who have stayed behind.

Chan Tak-fai and Mak Shiu-hon originally intended to rush back in time for this match, but yesterday Lam Chung-ho received a letter from Mok Hing in the air, stating that Mak will be retained by the Vietnamese hosts for a charity match on the tenth, making it difficult to leave the team midway. Therefore, Chan and Mak are not named in the China United lineup.

Eastern occupies the starting lineup, Kwong Wah two players, are all football country days, group or army, strength is quite strong, but South China's first-class players are not included, really feel a little short.

The Western Civil Servants lineup was decided yesterday after a general meeting with the relevant committee members of the team. However, it is still subject to the consent of the relevant associations. If there are no changes, it will be finalized. The two teams' lineups are listed below. (Football Field Grand Duke)

### Tung Wah's Good Fortune: Resurrected from Despair. Scores Two Goals in the Last Three Minutes. Miraculously Reverses Defeat, 6-5 Against St. Francis.

[Shanghai Correspondence, 9th] Tung Wah and St. Francis's West League Division A football league match took place at Yih Garden yesterday (8th). Tung Wah, in the face of despair, was resurrected and scored two consecutive goals in the last three minutes to reverse the defeat with a score of 6-5. The team was so lucky that fans called the win an unexpected bonus. In the first half, Tung Wah took the lead three times, but the score was tied at 3-3. In the second half, St. Francis took the lead, first 4-3, then 5-4, creating a seesaw battle. Unexpectedly, Tung Wah's victory came out of the blue. Tsui Shing-hun and Man Yeung-wah scored consecutive goals, securing the victory and leaving St. Francis bewildered.

Seesaw Battle, Tied at 3-3

Tung Wah attacked first with great momentum, and the St. Francis team had little resistance. Ng Ping-ho and Ka Yau-leung made two crosses, but Man Sheung-wah missed the opportunity both times, which was a pity. In the seventh minute, Sheung-wah picked up the ball, and Ah Dai made a show of strength. Shum Sze-yin dived and headed the ball from five yards out, bouncing off Kai Buck-to's shoulder and into the net. Tung Wah took the lead. A series of attacks put St. Francis in danger. After a quarter of an hour, St. Francis's Lai Ke-fu-si-ki broke through. Cheung Siu-peng missed a tackle, and Kai Locke Rich tried a long shot from 25 yards. Chow Tat-wan rushed out of the goal to intercept, but missed and the ball slipped through his hands into the net, tying the score at 1-1. Tung Wah then attacked and achieved results. Five minutes later, Tung Wah's luck arrived. Ng Ping-ho cut in from the wing, and Tai Lin-king and Shum Sze-yin charged up together. Shum Sze-yin knocked Kai down, and the ball went into the net along with him. Tung Wah took the lead again at 2-1. Five minutes later, Yan Da-ye shot, Tat-wan was out of position, and Siu-cheung retreated to kick it out. However, Tsui Shing-cho accidentally fouled, resulting in a penalty. Ford scored to tie the score at 2-2. In the 34th minute, Tai Lin-king's shot was blocked, Ng Ping-ho took a low shot, Kai blocked it but fumbled, and the ball went into the net. Tung Wah took the lead for the third time at 3-2. But Hui Yi-chi shot and the ball bounced off the goalpost into the net, tying the score at 3-3 at the end of the first half.

Out of the Blue, Two Consecutive Goals

In the second half, both Tung Wah and St. Francis had opportunities. Soon, Cheung Siu-peng was injured and left the field, but returned shortly after. After a quarter of an hour of stalemate, Pun Tak-sun fouled Siu-cheung, resulting in a free kick. Kai Locke Rich dived and headed the ball into the top right corner. Tat-wan was unable to save it, and St. Francis took the lead at 4-3 for the first time. But just one minute later, after Tung Wah kicked off from the center line, Ah Dai took a low shot near the goal and immediately tied the score at 4-4. After another quarter of an hour of mutual attacks, Ford crossed, Siu-cheung intercepted, Yan Da-ye intercepted, only a foot away, and shot into the bottom corner, taking the lead again. Tung Wah, seeing the seriousness of the situation, attacked with all its might. St. Francis defended desperately. The stalemate lasted until the last three minutes, and Tung Wah still had not made any progress. The audience was already standing up, but unexpectedly, Tsui Shing-moved and unleashed his skills, as if out of the blue, scoring a goal and tying the score at 5-5. After unexpectedly scoring a goal, the attack suddenly intensified. In the last minute, Ah Dai hooked the ball, Ka passed it to Man, Sheung-wah took a low shot, and the ball went into the net, making the score 6-5. Tung Wah immediately turned defeat into victory. Although Sheung-wah left the field due to injury, it no longer mattered. With a loud whistle, Tung Wah defeated St. Francis 6-5. Fans congratulated each other on Tung Wah's "good luck".

Our school community has made small contributions to the ship donation work in the past, and we are even more eager to respond to this one-dollar debt repayment movement. Regarding the motion proposed by members of the Standing Committee Tang Chi-ching, Wong Tat-hang, and Chan Fong-lam to launch the Hong Kong Student Debt Repayment Movement, after discussion, it was decided that your association is a joint body of the Hong Kong branch of the Overseas Chinese Education Association and the Kowloon Education Association. If you can lead the schools to organize the campaign, it will be more effective. It has been decided to send a letter to your association to lead the organization. We respectfully request that you handle it and provide guidance.

### Tsang Chor-chi Returns from Overseas, Joins Eastern

[Special Dispatch] South China joined the Division A League in 1934. At that time, the team captain, Tsang Chor-chi (center forward), had good leadership skills. Many fans recognized him. In 1936, Tsang went to Malaya and was invited to play for a team, changing his position to inside forward. After two years of hard work, his football skills improved compared to before. When he returned to Hong Kong last month, he was given a certificate. It is heard that Tsang has joined the Eastern Club. In the Shen Group League match between Eastern and Kowloon Club next Saturday, Tsang Chung-wan is reportedly feeling unwell and will rest. Tsang Chor-chi will be transferred to the inside forward position.

However, because the commemorative plaques for the teams could not be made on time, the ceremony was delayed. The association has recently held a meeting to discuss the matter. Once all preparations are completed, the awards will be presented in a short time. The men's team champion is the Confucius Hall, the women's team champion is the Silver Star, the men's singles champion is Siu Siu-kau, and the women's champion is Yeung Wai-pan.

### Watson and Colorgan to Leave Hong Kong

The British transport ship "Dilwara" will return to England from Hong Kong on the 23rd of this month. Many members of the Far East military community, some who have completed their service and some who have been reassigned, will return home on this ship. The captain of the Division A Middlesex football team, Watson (right inside forward), right winger Colorgan, and left back Hicks (water polo team center forward) of Division B will also leave Hong Kong on this ship. The departure of Watson and Colorgan will weaken the strength of the Middlesex team and the Hong Kong football community. Watson and Colorgan are outstanding players in this football season and are highly likely to be selected for the interport games. Many foreign fans are sad to see them leave. There are also many good cricketers and swimmers returning home on the same ship.

### 電影戲劇

Entertainment…The Counterfeit Aristocrat

Lord Jeff

Is a film with educational significance that will greatly interest every parent and general youth.

Freddie Bartholomew, who once moved every member of the audience in "David Copperfield," plays an orphan who has been spoiled and is exploited by a pair of cunning con artists. They train him to impersonate the son of a nobleman and travel around swindling people. Later, he is arrested and sent to a reform school for delinquent boys, where he is forced to learn nautical skills. The story tells of his life with a group of classmates of his kind. One of his classmates is played by the brash and lively child actor, Mickey Rooney, who has already risen to the rank of junior officer at the school. The counterfeit aristocrat is captured during an attempted escape, but they later become friends.

We still remember these two child stars, who once collaborated in "Captains Courageous." Although they portray very different personalities, they complement each other well and make an excellent team. Now they are a little older, and their acting has matured along with them, especially in portraying the personalities of young people. This, combined with an interesting story and the children's sincere, enthusiastic, and courageous performances, enriches the film's content.

Queen…The Voluptuous Woman Chases the Navy

Give Me A Sailor

The previous collaborations between Martha Raye and Bob Hope have all been very successful, and they give even more outstanding performances in this film, proving that they are a very suitable team. The film is full of endless laughs and is an ideal work for audiences looking for entertainment when watching movies.

The story depicts the wild and unrestrained life of some American sailors on leave. Among them, a pair of close friends serving on the same ship make a lot of jokes because they pursue the wrong love interests.

Martha Raye is the central figure of the film's humor. She plays a neglected but self-amorous young woman and maintains an excellent performance from beginning to end. Bob, with his funny facial expressions and humorous and timeless lines, can be called doubly brilliant.

Also co-starring is Betty Grable, a beautiful and lively actress who also has a clear and melodious singing voice. The film has a total of four new songs, all recent works by famous musicians, sung by the two of them, adding a lot of entertainment to the film.

Peace…Carnival Queen

Carnival Queen

A film set against the background of a carnival fairground, the story tells of the orphaned daughter of a former fairground owner who seeks to revive her father's business. She changes her name and participates in carnival performances. Due to internal discord, many disputes arise. At the same time, the film interweaves a story of thieves and detectives, because a group of actors are actually thieves in disguise, using this as a hiding place. This film has no star value, the fairground is not lively, and the carnival performances are not exciting.

Oriental…Little Tough Guy

Little Tough Guy

This film features a small star from "Dead End." The content of this film is similar to the former and is a very good educational film. The performances are very diligent.

Dahua—The Hurricane

The Hurricane

The story is very moving, depicting a youth of color who is sentenced to imprisonment for hitting a drunken white man. Unable to bear the oppression, he escapes from prison several times, resulting in a sixteen-year sentence. In the end, a flood breaks out. The camera techniques are very successful, the actors are well-coordinated, and the performances are very good.

Jingxing…The Skating Bride

Happy Landing

The entire performance has no disappointing elements, especially the several song and dance scenes. The song "A Gypsy Told Me" is very beautiful. Sonja Henie's skating skills and performances have shown significant progress. Don Ameche and Cesar Romero are also competent.

Central…Love's Tears of Blood

Sound Film

This is an adaptation of Luo Chen's original work. I remember that when Lianhua Film Company raised the banner of "Reviving National Cinema," it was once made into a silent film called "Love and Duty." This time, Xinhua Film Company has made it into a sound film, directed by Shi Wan Cang, who can be said to be experienced in this area. The male lead is still played by Jin Yan, only the female lead and the remaining supporting roles have been replaced by Yuan Meiyun and Mei Xi.

In a simple sentence, the story depicts a woman in a feudal society who struggles repeatedly and ultimately ends her life with self-sacrifice.

In terms of performance, it can be said to be a satisfactory work. Many of the scenes of Yang Naifan and Li Zuyi's love are concise and humorous. After Yang elopes, Li encounters obstacles everywhere and eventually dies. The gradually intensifying emotions are well-grasped. However, the "Adorable Mother" opera scene is too long and disrupts the mood of the entire play. Jin Yan, Yuan Meiyun, and Hai Xi's performances are all satisfactory.

New World…Spring Passionate Fire

Cantonese Film

This film describes the dark side of a large hotel and the strange and bizarre social dynamics, exposing the deformed development of society. It evokes great emotion in the viewer. This film is the first production of Justice Company, starring Kuang Shanxiao and Chen Yunshang.

Beihe…Cantonese Opera

### A Novel Expansion in the Sports World, Sent by Liren from The Hague

[European Correspondence] Mr. Liangcai, the former curator of the Shenbao Museum, had a famous saying: "The newspaper is a mirror of society." It means that the written spirit progresses with the society's emotions and thoughts. The New Year's editions of major newspapers in advanced countries are usually dominated by "Sports Specials," occupying a significant portion of the publication, standing side by side with major events tables and retrospectives of the past year. This shows that powerful nations favor action and rely on strong physiques to enhance the national spirit. Today, all kinds of sports and games, and all programs that are widely discussed, have united organizations and worldwide unity. Special competitions in countries such as England, America, and France have become popular pastimes deeply welcomed by the masses in certain regions or societies. The reason why they can innovate and stand out mostly stems from the mutual integration of two sports. By observing the following sections, one can silently understand the evolution of new sports techniques.

(1) "Ice Hockey" with ice skating blades added to the soles of shoes has been seen in winter world sports events and world championships have been held.

(2) Ice surface tennis, with ice skating wheels attached to the soles of shoes, is still rare in various countries.

(3) Water surface slalom, imitating slope sliding and passing through flag gates, is a kayak competition. This method was created not long ago and involves using a paddle to propel a small, light boat (kayak) in a zigzag course across the water surface, passing through very low gates. In terms of speed, it cannot compare to the swiftness of skiing down a slope, but it is very strenuous because it must pass through many difficult obstacles like a brick running race.

(4) "Aqua-Plane" is a variation of skiing where a skier holds a long rope connected to a speedboat and uses the power of the speedboat to move quickly. The Chinese translation of "Aqua-Plane" means "flying down and spreading wings in the air." This was created seven years ago by Norwegian skiing champion Petrsen and is now popular on the French Riviera. The skis must reach a speed of 60 kilometers per hour (that is, travel 60 kilometers per hour) on the water before they begin to float. At this time, the person speeding through the waves can stand upright. If the speed of the speedboat is not high enough, the person standing behind may lose balance and fall into the water.

(5) Swimming face down and using both arms as paddles to race on the water. The body should lie prone on the center-rear half of a longboard so that the rear half sinks slightly and the front half is slightly raised. This sport is suitable for summer, trying it on water surfaces with waves that are neither too strong nor too weak. Those who are proficient can prepare themselves to practice. It is said that the water towns of America have held three-mile (five-kilometer) arm-paddling speed competitions. The winner relied on shoulder strength to win the championship, which is truly commendable.

(6) Standing upright on a non-paddle kayak that is difficult to balance is a water surface balancing act. Extend both arms to the left and right and quickly turn to act as a propeller. The progress of the boat is very slow, and it is very difficult not to fall into the water. This is a kind of "Intermezzo" program used for competition breaks, only for entertainment.

(7) "Motorcycle Football" is a way to test football with each driving a motorcycle. This is a technique for machine foot painting, other sports, and a table. For example, American stuntman Bud Hamilton even took the risk of riding a motorcycle to perform the "High Tower Grain Water" trick, which amazed the audience.

(8) "Water Dragon Football," which is just a name without the reality. Members of German water fire associations play football using a water-spraying ball, using the force of the water jet to carry out the government's orders.

(9) The waiter race through the streets of Paris is held every year. For the last kilometer, each participant must carry a tray of soup. The first to arrive with the soup not spilled wins the top prize.

(10) Two people riding a tandem bicycle is popular in British Australia. In the tandem race, the man is usually in the front and the woman is in the back.

### Shanghai East China Rising Up, Due to West Force Being Transferred

(Shanghai Correspondent) West Force, the current leader in this year's West League football competition, has dominated since being transferred to Shanghai. It is now known that the team has received orders to transfer from Shanghai within two weeks and return to their homeland of Scotland. From now on, there will be one less strong team. East China is currently in second place, with a great hope of taking over.

(Note) West Force is the former Shifu, who was stationed in Hong Kong the year before last. When they were in Hong Kong, they were already a strong team in the football competition, so it is no wonder that they dominate in Shanghai.

### The ×× Movement in the Realm of Public Opinion

— Chen Yimin

When Jingwei's telegram of treason was issued, anyone with a bit of national consciousness rose up to condemn and attack his theory of compromise that would lead to the destruction of the country. However, some "non-national failure theorists" who claimed to be "concerned about the country and the people" were still publishing articles in their official newspapers to support their "Vice President Wang."

They reiterated the suggestions of their "Vice President," embellishing its form, enriching its content, emphasizing its significance, and elucidating its purpose. After the Central Party Headquarters explicitly ordered the permanent cancellation of their "Vice President's" party membership, they made a grand, impassioned "protest" filled with tears. Amidst the strong calls of the people across the country to resist to the end without compromise or surrender, they actively elaborated on their theory (which was, of course, their "Vice President Wang's" theory). Thus, in their official newspapers, they talked a great deal about "peace and war," "stance," and "outlook."

They brazenly concealed themselves, distorted others, and used all sorts of clever "logic" to prove their theories. They wanted to use sophistical, large and small characters, with neat circles added to the side, to confuse the masses, but they instead revealed their "hairy hooves" in their articles.

First, they attempted to conflate "peace" and "compromise" to confuse the public. They cunningly misinterpreted the true meaning of peace in the declaration of the Provisional National Congress and affirmed their theory of compromising and destroying the country through "peace."

They said that we should now negotiate for peace under the good conditions—"without harming China's sovereignty and territory"—because "we do not have the ability to fight any longer," because "peace" is the goal of our resistance, and because the result of all wars is "peace," and China cannot be an exception. Therefore, they advocated striving for the "initiative" of "peace" according to the suggestion of their "Vice President Wang" (because such a suggestion is "in principle" "harmless" to China's sovereignty and territory and is beneficial to the country and the people). They are simply "national destruction theorists"! (not just national failure theorists) They not only want to destroy the country, but also want to "actively" destroy the country!

They also said that "Mr. Wang" sees everything and says everything, and can be compared to Clemenceau of France and Lenin of the Russian Revolution. The extent of their sycophancy is perhaps directly proportional to the thickness of their skin, turning an opportunist who sells out the country and the nation into China's "Clemenceau" and "Lenin"—what an excellent joke! They also conflated Wang Jingwei's appeasement proposal with Lenin's signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, deliberately ignoring the differences in the nature, circumstances, basis, and conditions of the war at that time and the current Sino-Japanese War. This kind of "fooling people with cheap tricks" is really disgusting!

They also said that "Mr. Wang's" telegram was only a suggestion, which would be approved by the conference, otherwise it would be shelved or rejected, and should not be subject to such a punishment of expulsion from the party. At the same time, they also mumbled about the unreasonableness of the expulsion procedure. They are really "too clever." They simplified the facts, concealed Wang Jingwei's crimes of harming the country and the people, and hoped to deceive all the indignant compatriots. However, the facts do not allow them to sophistize. Wang Jingwei's traitorous actions are already publicly known. His compromising remarks are the basis for his actual betrayal of national interests. All the collusion, instigation, and subversive conspiracies are based on this basis. They want to distort and reduce the facts, and faithfully execute ×××××××××, this pitiful appearance cannot withstand the public's contempt and attack.

These ×××××× are annoying. In addition to the above, they are constantly working to undermine the united front, constantly "anti-Communist, anti-Communist." Perhaps this is an implicit "pro-Japanese, pro-Japanese!"

Let us launch a broad ×××××! Purge the national destruction theorists, and purge the pro-Japanese traitors and Trotskyites in our realm of public opinion. We must give a powerful blow to those who still call themselves "Vice President Wang"!

### "Fearless"

— Du Luoer

Mr. Wang's "fearless" spirit of "jumping into the fire pit" is indeed "great." In fact, his "greatness" does not lie in "jumping" over the "fire pit," but in treating our current resistance as "jumping into the fire pit" (that is, suicide). I remember that when the Japanese army began to occupy various strongholds in North China, Hitler's news agency sighed and said: "The Japanese soldiers' offensive is an unstoppable force," meaning that although China is resisting this time, it will eventually not avoid the destruction of the country. From this, it can be seen that Mr. Wang's greatness is something that Japanese soldiers should admire.

Well, since someone is cheering, it wouldn't hurt to be a little more "fearless." Look, his henchmen are now elated and cheering because of Wang's rebellion. They say that Wang's "fearless action" is a "virtue" with "a long-term vision" and "unprecedented emotions." It is said that this "fearless action" "is either unique or overturns the status quo; either reforms society or destroys violence; it offends the complacent psychology of mankind and attacks the tyranny of power."

These words look quite beautiful and are quite "fearless." It's just that they are not "fearless" enough. If they could abandon the dodge and evade tactics and say bluntly, "Either it destroys the resistance, or it overthrows the current government." I think that this would undoubtedly gain even more "fearless" or even "dauntless" cheers.

It is not a miracle that humans can say the above words. It is a miracle of our country that people can be as stubborn and shameless as dogs. Mr. Wang is strongly opposed to people giving him the hat of "defeatism," but his henchmen immediately put a "fearless" crown on him. Our resistance today is seen as "complacency" and "defeatism" by a "fearless theory" author in a certain newspaper, while his master's rebellion and harming the country is "offending the complacent psychology of mankind." Mr. Wang actually wants to use the "fearless" act of colluding with ×× to harm the country to "offend the complacent psychology" of our resistance today. Think, except for a ××××××, who would say such shameless words? Who else could say it?

Is it reasonable that our entire people's resistance movement is called "violence" by traitors? Is it right that our government's determination to eliminate rebels is called "tyranny of power" by traitors? Wang's future "fearless" actions will be to unite with the ×× puppet government to "attack the tyranny of power." That goes without saying. ××××× is so "fearless" to such an extent, it is really shocking.

However, the "fearless" ferocity of the traitors is not limited to this. Please take another look at their "fearless" ranting! The author of the "fearless" theory continued: Wang's departure this time is clearly an act for the benefit of mankind, because conflict with violence is called bizarre; it is clearly an action to seek national liberation, because conflict with violence is called rebellion, and even "fearless" is called "cowardice," and "cowardice" is called "fearless"...

The Japanese said recently that they want to use the imperial army and traitors to "establish a new order in East Asia." Wang's followers now also say that they want to use the splitting movement and the "fearless" action of colluding with ×× to beg for peace to "seek liberation for the nation." This is the process of the traitors' "fearless" turning into "dauntless." Although the "fearless" spirit of the traitors is originally such a set, it cannot be said that it has no real "fearless" aspects. For two or three unworthy people to actually rebel against 450 million people, this is the so-called real "fearless."

### The Disaster of the Maple Trees

— Su Geng

—One of the dispatches from the rear

Just as the breakfast call was blowing, a × plane air raid alert was received. So the brothers cursed and put down their rice bowls, ran to their respective bunks, took their guns and bullets, and evacuated to the orange groves in the fields in front of the troops. Second-class private Hu Laowu, a machine gunner, hurriedly carried the machine gun and ran to the orange grove. He ran and thought about the two cents of chicken he had just bought that he hadn't taken a bite of yet, regretting that he hadn't brought the chicken out.

The sound of × planes, the sound of motors, was already rippling in the air. A tense atmosphere enveloped people's hearts. Hu Laowu didn't dare to breathe even a little, watching the three × planes fly over. He silently loaded the bullets into the gun chamber and hung the machine gun on the branches of the orange tree.

"Hey, Laowu, what are you doing?"

Huang Zuocai stretched out a hand and gently pushed Hu Laowu, saying in a low voice. A tense atmosphere flashed across Hu Lao's face, making his eyes even more piercing. He pushed Huang Zuocai's hand away with his wrist, lowering his thick voice and said:

"Don't talk, the × planes are flying overhead."

Saying that, he grabbed the machine gun's button, staring like an ox at the × planes overhead. The red medicine sign of the × planes was clearly reflected in his eyes. The deafening machine gun excited every corner of the earth. Hu Laowu's hand tightly grabbed the machine gun's button, and never let go for a moment.

The × planes flew overhead, circled for a while in the sky above the village four or five miles away, and then flew back. Hu Laowu, who had already relaxed his heart, had to become nervous again. He shook his body and moved the machine gun to face the belly of the plane.

"Hey, Laowu, this old field frog is upside down" It's a little wrong."

Huang Zuocai leaned his gun against the orange tree and hid under a larger orange tree.

"Damn those three old things, if they drop big eggs on my head, I'll bet this row of bullets against him."

Hu Laowu scratched his head and said angrily, but he never loosened the thing he was holding in his hand.

The × planes flew around the lower sky of the small town for a week, and then flew to the lower sky of the troops to reconnoiter. People became nervous with the sound of the planes. Suddenly, two × planes turned their tails and made a somersault. They dropped two bombs beside the highway three hundred meters away. The strong explosion shook the earth, Hu Laowu's heart beat wildly, he tightly grabbed the machine gun, nervously watching the sky. The × planes in the sky circled around the small town and the surrounding space again; then, they flew east.

After the × planes left, people put down their nervous hearts and ran out of their respective shelters. Hu Laowu stretched and retreated the bullets from the gun chamber, picked up the machine gun, and walked out. Now he was thinking about his two cents of chicken again.

Xie Haishan, a soldier in the stretcher platoon, jumped over from the highway, excitedly shouting:

"Two bombs destroyed three maple trees."

Second-class private Hu Laowu shouldered the machine gun, smiled and raised his left hand.

"Hey, Lao Xie, don't care about what the hell the planes destroyed the maple trees, let's go eat chicken."

Hengshan Ten Communications

### Even Girls Secretly Slipped Away

— Xiao Yin'e

Hengshan—a key point on the Yuehan Railway, a place where soldiers gathered, and an important county in the rear during the four periods of the War of Resistance. The women of Hengshan understood this. They rose up. On the streets and in the alleys, there were their clear and resounding songs of national salvation. In shops and societies, they conducted individual visits. In backward rural villages, they adopted theatrical propaganda methods to inspire backward masses. In their lives full of enthusiasm and energy, they were developing their ambitions to save the country.

Social traditions could no longer restrain their strong will to save the nation or extinguish the fire of anger for national salvation. They still struggled in the darkness, wrestled in pain, and under strict surveillance, they secretly ran out to discuss with the sisters of national salvation staying in Hengshan and consult with the county party headquarters, to formally establish a theater troupe with a minimum of living expenses and regular operating funds, so that they could have better work performance and gain the trust of society and their families.

Organization

Enthusiastic sisters and young people staying in Hengshan gathered nineteen people. They organized the First Theater Troupe of the Hengshan County Party Headquarters. To avoid friction with the stubborn remnants of feudal forces, the theater troupe was nominally divided into male and female teams, with one head, divided into several sections: propaganda, drama, and general affairs. A supervisor was also appointed, a comrade from the Political Department's Eighth Drama Team, whose main responsibility was to improve their general technical level and strengthen their political awareness!

Mother and Daughter Together at the Meeting

In the meeting hall of the county party headquarters on a clear midday, a rectangular table was set up, adorned with many snacks such as peanuts and melon seeds. Old ladies holding children, old men leaning on crutches, and a group of energetic young people gathered together. Some held records of the atrocities of the enemy, page after page of blood debts flowing through their eyes, questioning with sorrow! It was revealed between their eyebrows, the flames of anger burning in our hearts! A sincere and short welcome speech began in a solemn atmosphere! A burst of applause echoed around the venue. A comrade from the Political Department's Eighth Drama Team forcefully said; "...Such a great unity of old and young, men and women, is the main factor in our struggle for final victory and a powerful weapon for us to strike the Japanese devils. If we want to win the battle, we must each do our best and take on the work we should do..." These words from the hearts of everyone who did not want to be a slave resonated throughout the audience, and applause filled every gap. The old man excitedly replied; We are also willing to work together, fight guerrillas, and do everything. As long as we drive away the ××××, and everyone can live in peace, who wouldn't want to do it?

### The Distance Between Two Eras

— Meng Qi

That tearful farewell became the eternal farewell between us, father and son.

When the Shanghai War broke out last year, I sent a letter home from Guangdong, outlining three strategies: the best strategy was to move back to our old home in Anhui, the middle strategy was to move to Shanghai, and the worst strategy was to take refuge in the countryside. My father wrote back very firmly:

"...Our army's morale is strong, and the Japanese invaders will definitely find it difficult to succeed. I have more information here and have my own ideas. You don't need to advise from afar... There are quite a few villagers staying here, all watching my actions to decide their own. I have no other way to repay the country, at least I should maintain a calm attitude to help stabilize society..."

Later, the situation on the Beijing-Shanghai line suddenly changed, and my father finally failed to escape, falling into the occupied zone. He usually had a very strong sense of justice, and seeing the kind of ×××× of the × people, I'm sure he must have been filled with anger. Given the difficulty of finding a doctor when the illness worsened, and the various difficulties of going from the countryside to the city, the letter contained only a few words, the situation of which can be imagined—all of which contributed to his inability to recover from the illness. My father was not directly killed by the × people, but indirectly, he was ×××××××!

My father can be considered to be at rest, but resting in the land occupied by the ××, he certainly would not be able to close his eyes in peace.

Now, as I flip through the letters, I found these words on my father's last letter:

"...It is great luck that we can still survive in the world after the flames of war. You don't need to ask about other things, asking is useless... The mountains and rivers are still the same, but everything about people has changed, and it is impossible not to be sick... You don't need to worry too much, you should focus on your work with thoughts of home. Although I cannot see you, my heart is very comforted..."

Father! Your words are obscure, but I understand the meaning. I vow to follow your "last command" and "focus on my work." One day, I will be able to freely return to the place where you rest. At that time, you will surely be able to close your eyes in peace, Father!

Note: In our hometown's customs, on the lunar New Year's Eve, the younger generation must pay respect to their elders once, called "bidding farewell to the year."

(The End)
