### "Friends of Soldiers" Movement

The National YMCA Military Service Committee has recently launched a nationwide campaign to solicit "Friends of Soldiers." In advanced civilized countries, this kind of movement is a regular organization, and it is of particularly important significance for soldiers of oppressed nations resisting aggression. This is because the soldiers of oppressed nations engaged in the battle of resisting aggression are, in terms of both material equipment and spiritual education, even more dependent on the assistance of the people from all walks of life, which is naturally more necessary and urgent. Our country's current War of Resistance against Japan is a war in which a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country resists a modernized capital imperialist country. Our soldiers, in order to win the final victory, are even more dependent on the sympathy and assistance of the people. Therefore, the supreme leader has repeatedly instructed the whole country that "people's strength is more important than military strength," and leaders from all sides have repeatedly encouraged each other with "final victory depends on the people" and "thoroughly realize cooperation between the military and the people." In fact, since the start of the war twenty-three months ago, whether in North China or Central China, whether it was the Battle of Taierzhuang or the Battle of Dahongshan, the importance of the people's assistance to the military can be seen in the great victories won. As for the widespread guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, the significance of the military relying on the people is self-evident.

Since the War of Resistance, the National YMCA Military Service Committee has established sixteen branches in various war zones to carry out comfort, rescue, training, and propaganda work. Judging from the achievements of the past year, the number of soldiers served by the association has been no less than four million. Recently, the association also plans to expand the sixteen branches into forty locations, with an additional 250 service personnel. The current launch of the nationwide campaign to solicit "Friends of Soldiers" is to seek the unanimous assistance of enthusiastic people from all walks of life, so as to jointly work hard to actively promote this work. Its purpose is: (1) to implement cooperation between the military and the people; (2) to enhance the strength of the War of Resistance; (3) to fulfill the national duty; (4) to revive the martial spirit. In short, its work is nothing more than to do its duty as a friend to the soldiers resisting the war, to support the military service work, and to provide spiritual, material, and general economic assistance. Enthusiastically participating in this kind of movement should not only be the patriotic duty of every citizen, but also should be recognized as the right of every citizen to love the country. We should not only enthusiastically participate in this kind of movement to promote our great national spirit and national virtues, which have been passed down for five thousand years, but we should also, on a national scale, in the rear, in the war zone, and behind enemy lines, intensify and expand internal and external propaganda, and establish tens of thousands of organizations of "Friends of Chinese Soldiers!" The arduous struggle of Chinese soldiers today is not only for the liberation of China, but also for the defense of world peace, culture, and justice. We believe that this kind of movement can be widely launched!

### It's Not Easy to Live in Shanghai　Rice Price Reaches Twenty Yuan Per Dan　Enemy Puppets Plan to Control Fruits Again

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] Shanghai News: The price of rice here is becoming more and more expensive due to the enemy puppet monopoly and the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants. Now each dan has reached 20 yuan, and the people of the whole city are quite panicked about food. The concession authorities are now dealing with general manipulation by unscrupulous merchants with strict means.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Shanghai News: The enemy puppets are again attempting to control fruits. They organized the so-called Shanghai Central Fruit Production Market Combination in Zhabei. The Shanghai Fruit Industry Association held a special meeting on the 15th and decided to unanimously refuse to participate, and signed an oath to show their determination.

The Incident on the Taixi Road is Resolved

[Reuters, Shanghai, 18th] Yesterday, a large team of puppet police in western Shanghai, fully armed with pistols and wooden sticks, tried to cause trouble near the Public Concession. The British also dispatched a large team of British soldiers to rush to the scene, and the situation suddenly became serious, with a touch of hair trigger. Fortunately, after the British army negotiated with the puppet police officers, the puppets immediately withdrew, and the British army also withdrew, leaving only a few sentries on guard.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] Shanghai News: The strike at the Shanghai Lun Chang Textile Factory, because the enemy puppets are instigating behind the scenes, has not been able to resume work. A few days ago, the puppet side suddenly invited the Westerners from the factory to meet with Zhu Yuzhen, the puppet district commissioner, expressing their willingness to mediate the resumption of work. At that time, the Westerners from the factory stated their solemn position and rejected all the puppet side's conspiracies, and still followed reasonable methods between labor and capital to resolve it.

### The Enemy is as Overbearing as Ever　The Situation in Tianjin is Becoming More Serious　Concession Authorities Ban the Export of Food from the Concession　Enemy Shoots a Russian, Large-Scale Anti-British

[Reuters, Tokyo, 18th] According to a certain Japanese news agency, Japanese officials claimed that if the British government takes "urgent and effective steps" to protect its interests in China, Japan will be forced to take all necessary measures to cope with the new situation. The Japanese government said that the British declaration was trying to "wash away the big mistake" caused by the British authorities' stubborn refusal to hand over the murderer who should have been extradited for murdering the Tianjin Customs Supervisor, and said that the British side hoped to invite a third country to intervene in this incident. However, Japan cannot accept it in principle. Japanese officials pointed out that the suggestion was made so late, which was completely inappropriate for the actual environment. The Japanese side also mocked that the expectations caused by this incident were that the British authorities in China would thoroughly "improve" their policies, and that the British policy was not related to the policies of other countries enjoying interests in the Far East, and that what was said in the British declaration was not true.

Fifth Day of Blockade

[Our Newspaper, Shanghai, 18th, Special Dispatch] According to Japanese sources, the severity of the Tianjin Concession dispute is increasing: (1) The concession has adopted self-sufficient measures, banning all flour owned by Japanese people from being transported outside the concession; (2) The Japanese side is sending traitors to give speeches in Tianjin's downtown areas and theaters to incite anti-British sentiment; (3) The Japanese side is still inspecting and making things difficult for pedestrians entering and leaving the concession. On the morning of the 17th, they also shot a Russian.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 18th] According to Japanese telegrams, the Tianjin British Concession authorities yesterday ordered a ban on the export of flour from the concession, saying that this move aggravated the situation, because the Japanese side did not prohibit the export of vegetables, which is tense. This ban includes the transport of rented vegetables and other kinds of food into the concession for Japanese people and everyone else in the territory. [External News from Hong Kong] Tianjin News: On the 17th, a Russian person was storing flour and was considering dealing with such a situation when he was about to enter the British Concession. He was immediately killed by Japanese soldiers when he set up an obstacle at the Japanese solution. The Japanese authorities also heard that the English side was blocking the what the army was doing, was a serious provocation, and the Japanese soldiers are angry but that the Russian person was about to enter the Concession when he was shot and killed by the Japanese soldiers. British soldiers and Concession police were also present at the time, but they were unable to help.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Tianjin News: The Tianjin is scheduled to hold large-scale anti-British propaganda on the 17th and 18th, giving speeches on the streets, and holding a meeting at the Guomin Theater on Dongmalu. At that time, it will be broadcast by the puppet Tianjin Radio Station.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Tianjin News: The British and French Concessions are still under the enemy's continuous blockade and siege in Tianjin. Therefore, the inspection at the various intersection points is as strict as ever. Passengers traveling back and forth must go to the intersection points in advance at 3 am and wait until 5 am before the inspection begins. There are many people waiting for inspection at the British Concession International Bridge. Because they are exposed to the scorching sun, more than a hundred people have suffered heatstroke and fainted. When the inspection stopped at 6 pm, there were still people who had not been able to pass. The enemy's cruelty and disregard for humanity is truly indignant. The Italian Chamber of Commerce has packaged and transported some goods into the city, and has dredged through the enemy soldiers at certain places outside the intersection, but only a small amount can be transported in. However, due to the lack of natural ice and the hot weather, the vegetables, fish, and meat stored in the concession have all rotted, and the catering industry has suffered the most losses. Even foreign businessmen are suffering, and everyone hates the enemy. All the wharves and factories have been suspended because the workers have been blocked outside the concession. Hundreds of thousands of residents in the urban area and the Japanese Concession who used to make a living in the British and French Concessions have now completely lost their livelihoods. Some enemy merchants have been isolated from the British and French Concessions, and the sales of goods have also been interrupted, so people's hearts are greatly panicked. The has taken great pains to maintain law and order.

Fourth Day of Blockade

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Tianjin Foreign News: Yesterday was the fourth day of the Japanese blockade of foreign concessions. Various restrictive measures around the concession are more severe than before, which has made the food problem even more serious. Japan originally prohibited Chinese people from transporting food into the concession. Yesterday, it sent speedboats to patrol the rivers outside the Special Zone, and ordered all those carrying food to the British Concession to turn back. The Japanese side has also implemented strict restrictive measures on the southern border of the British Concession, and the required food can no longer be transported in from that side. At present, the vegetables stored in the concession are becoming increasingly scarce, and pork is also in short supply. Therefore, the Japanese restrictions are making the situation more serious. The temperature in the concession is currently around 100 degrees, and ice is extremely needed, which cannot be considered a luxury. In fact, the source of ice has also been cut off. The original ice storage will inevitably melt very quickly under such hot temperatures. Artificial ice plants are not fully equipped and cannot meet the current urgent needs of all parties. This is a very noteworthy event in the Japanese implementation of a "bloodless siege" of foreign concessions. Today, a large number of Chinese people are densely packed outside the concession, arranged in rows waiting for the Japanese to check them in order, and then allow them to enter the concession. In addition, everything in the concession is still calm. According to several Chinese people who entered the concession, they witnessed several farmers carrying burdens and baskets on the evening of the 16th, standing in line outside the concession, waiting for the Japanese to check them, hoping that the Japanese would allow them to pass, so that they could sell their hard-earned agricultural products to the concession. However, they have been waiting until now, for two days and two nights, and the Japanese have not yet allowed them to pass. It is estimated that only 200 Chinese people are allowed to enter the concession at each entrance every day. When Reuters visited Changzhi Vegetable Market, only empty stalls were seen everywhere, and only a few withered vegetables were arranged, which no one asked about. Meat shops only have a small amount of mutton left, and whether it is still fresh is questionable. There is still about 50 pounds of fish in the vegetable market, but because there is no ice to preserve it, buyers turn away after seeing it. During this Japanese blockade of the concession, the Japanese side does not hinder any Chinese people in the concession who wish to move out, especially those who wish to move to the Japanese concession. However, although the Japanese side has provided so many conveniences, the number of Chinese people moving out of the concession is still not large. This phenomenon is worth noting. The Japanese side has recently opened up a new road connected to the British Concession, which used to be rarely visited by pedestrians and has now become the main passage. The dense crowds are not scattered all day long. Rickshaws, handcarts, donkey carts, and trucks are also constantly on the road, because the road is accessible in all directions, not only connected to the British Concession, but also from this road to the Special Zone to the Japanese Concession and Chinese territory. British people in the concession are unwilling to be insulted, to lose their dignity, or to be harassed, so they are unwilling to leave the concession. However, there are still a few British people who must leave the concession due to their duties.

### British Warships Sail to Quanzhou　To Protect Merchant Ships　Enemy Ships Prevent Passengers on Ships from Landing

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 18th] Yesterday, Saturday, a certain British merchant ship, loaded with passengers from Xiaoluson, attempted to sail to Quanzhou Port north of Xiamen, but was approached by a Japanese warship, which requested the British shipowner to pass the Japanese warship. However, the shipowner refused its request. Only a small number of passengers were able to land, because the coastal fortress prevented them during the day, and the Japanese army fired shots at the passenger barges at night. The British naval commander has now ordered a British destroyer anchored in Xiamen to sail to Quanzhou to maintain the British ship and sail it back to Xiamen.

### Wen Zongyao and Others　Unconscious　Poisoning Case at the Japanese Consulate General in Nanjing　Enemy Puppets Frightened Residents

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Shanghai News: People from Nanjing said that after the poisoning case at the Japanese Consulate General, the traitors such as Wen Zongyao are still unconscious and their lives are in danger. The Japanese side conducted a large-scale search, and the puppet police extorted a lot of money. If they are not satisfied, they will be arrested. The situation is tense, and the residents are uneasy.

### Delegation of the National Comfort Association　Departs for the Front to Offer Comfort　Telegrams to the Whole Country Request Response

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] The General Association of the National Comfort Committee for War of Resistance Soldiers telegraphed the provincial and municipal party headquarters and the provincial and municipal mobilization committees on the 18th, saying: The soldiers at the front have been fighting bloody battles for nearly two years. In addition to regularly transporting comfort items, the Association has specially organized two frontline comfort delegations, which have been assigned senior personnel to participate by Chairman Lin and Chairman Jiang of the Central Standing Committee, and personnel have been sent by relevant agencies and groups to join. They are scheduled to depart from Chongqing on June 20. Ma Chaojun and Xie Zuomin have been appointed as the head of the Southern Delegation, and Guo Moruo and Wang Dayu have been appointed as the heads of the Northern Delegation. The Association has now prepared banners, clothing, medicines, publications, comfort letters, etc., and 240,000 yuan in cash to purchase comfort items locally, which will be transported to the front lines with the delegation. In order to expand the impact of comfort, we hereby telegraph your provincial and municipal party headquarters and mobilization committee. If the local people donate comfort items temporarily when the delegation passes through, it will be even more meaningful to participate in the event. However, please inform the local people's groups that the Association has limited transportation, so we hope that they will find their own way to transport the comfort items they donate, so as to avoid difficulties. The National Comfort Committee for War of Resistance Soldiers, printed in Chongqing on the 18th.

### × "Prospects with the Asia Development Board"

—Increasingly Sharp Internal Conflict—

[People's Revolutionary Society, Jinxi Correspondence] Since the so-called "Asia Development Board" of the Japanese fascist military clique was established in mid-December of last year, personnel and other organizational issues have attracted the attention of the general public in Japan. The main reason is whether the "Asia Development Board" can replace the Special Affairs Department. However, among the matters agreed upon by the × Cabinet, one item is that after the establishment of the "Asia Development Board" in China, it will immediately take charge of all political, economic, and cultural affairs. The military Special Affairs Department and other agencies should hand over the above-mentioned affairs immediately after the establishment of the resident agency in China. Therefore, the Japanese military's agencies stationed in China need to determine their relationship with the "Asia Development Board," but whether the Special Affairs Department agencies can completely hand over political, economic, and cultural affairs has become a difficult problem for the × Cabinet to deal with.

The difficulty for the × people is that even if the former resident agencies in China of the three provinces of the navy, army, and foreign affairs are brought together, their policies and intentions cannot be consistent, which will inevitably reduce the effectiveness of policy implementation. Secondly, the work belonging to political and economic departments cannot actually be separated from war. If the "Asia Development Board Branch," which is directly under the Cabinet, has strong powers, friction will inevitably occur with local agencies.

This is a problem that the × bandit cabinet cannot cope with and is also a problem that has attracted the attention of the general public. However, this "attention" is excessive worry, as the × bandit warlords already have a plan "in mind."

Since Hiranuma succeeded Konoe in forming a cabinet, the power of the × bandit army has become even stronger than before. In order to use its new power, it must seize the greatest power in the struggles between the various factions in Japan. The Hiranuma Cabinet is actually still controlled by the Konoe Cabinet. Most of the original important cabinet members have not been replaced after Hiranuma took office and are still controlled by the military. Therefore, no matter what the organization and intentions of the "Asia Development Board" are, or what the conspiracy to build a new order in East Asia is, it is always aimed at the goals and interests of the warlords. In terms of personnel, the military is adopting monopolistic and dictatorial methods. The establishment of the "Liaison Department" is a concrete realization of this "method."

The main agency implementing the policies of the "Asia Development Board" is the "Asia Development Board Liaison Department." It was established simultaneously on March 1 in five locations: Beiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hohhot (Gui Sui), and Xiamen. "Liaison Department Branch Offices" were also established simultaneously in Kaifeng, Zhangde, Taiyuan, Nanjing, and Hankou. The heads of the Liaison Department are concurrently held by naval officers. It has now been decided that Kita Seiichi (降軍少將, a defector Major General) will be stationed in Beiping as the head of the North China Liaison Department; Sakai Takashi (陸軍少將, Army Major General) will be stationed in Suiyuan as the head of the Mengjiang Liaison Department; Toa Haruzō will be stationed in Xiamen as the head of the Xiamen Liaison Department; Shibata Yaichirō (海軍大佐, Navy Colonel) will be stationed in Qingdao as the head of the Qingdao Branch Office; and the Taiyuan Branch Office will be concurrently held by the head of the × Special Affairs Agency, Hagiwara Nahuao. The heads and deputy heads of the above-mentioned Liaison Departments are all filled by investigators from the "Asia Development Board."

From this, we can see the following facts:

1. The heads of the Liaison Departments are all important figures in the military, and the "Asia Development Board" is simply another agency controlled by the warlords.

2. Even if the Asia Development Board Liaison Department is established, the Special Affairs Agency still cannot completely hand over political, economic, and cultural affairs, which means that the Liaison Department cannot replace the Special Affairs Agency. Not only that, but the Special Affairs Agencies in various places even have a陰　 to expand their powers, and this attempt has already been realized in Shanxi.

In the past, Shanxi only had the Taiyuan Special Affairs Agency and the Yuncheng Branch Office to handle political, economic, and security-related events. Now, on February 1, the Taiyuan Special Affairs Agency was upgraded to the "Shanxi Special Affairs Agency," and all the county liaison officers previously established were incorporated into the newly established Special Affairs Agency. The Special Affairs Agencies established in various parts of the province have now been formally established one after another, and the newly appointed heads have all taken office.

3. The simultaneous existence of the "Asia Development Board Liaison Department" and the "Special Affairs Agency," two aggressive agencies under the control of the warlords　, will inevitably increase aggression and pressure on China.

4. The heads of the Liaison Departments are army personnel in Beiping and Suiyuan, and navy personnel in Xiamen and Shanghai, which further proves that the Japanese land and naval departments each have their own intentions. Although they try their best to avoid conflicts, the contradictions between them are deepening day by day.

Summarizing the above points, we can see the arrogance of the Japanese × warlords and the powerlessness of the × Cabinet. Therefore, the establishment of the "Asia Development Board" is merely another tool for the warlords to invade and exploit China. The so-called construction of a new order in East Asia is just a smokescreen. However, although the Japanese × warlords hold great power, their internal conflicts are also deepening day by day. The power struggle between the Liaison Department and the Special Affairs Department also adds another opportunity. At the same time, the people of × will not be blinded by them, and anti-war sentiment is rising day by day. The so-called "Asia Development Board" is just wishful thinking. (湧上)

Advancing Through the × People's Artillery Fire

××× Chen, the chief　, sincerely asked us to stay for dinner, but we had agreed to gather at Lychee Mound tonight, so we　　 Chen's invitation, and we arrived at Futian with the setting sun　.

Futian　 was also burned and bombed by the × people last year, turning it into a flat land, with only crises and ashes left. The fallen　　 some have already grown　　, two stores only have stairs left, these　　 scorched snake bones hang on the　edge, and gray rats crawl up there.　Apart from that　, there is a figure, and only when we arrived at the township office did we see　self　　, and a dozen armed civilians, who were strangers to us　.

Futian is simply a ruin. There are no people during the day, and the situation at night can be imagined. The creators of this ruin are now more than ten miles away from here, and they may come again to slaughter tomorrow. Five hours before we arrived here, they—the murderers in the sky—were still frantically dropping a few bombs.

The militiamen at the township office were very nervous, each carrying a gun and prepared for the arrival of the × people. Battalion Commander × gave us a message that a unit of × people in plain clothes had been discovered in the Lianhe area, fifteen miles from Futian. He hinted to us that there would definitely be fighting here by tomorrow at the latest. Indeed, they had already started using all sorts of things—using the terrain and features to set up various positions. After we relayed this message, everyone felt the same tension and excitement. At the same time, clear sounds of bombs and artillery were heard, "This is a signal that the × people are invading." The old　is judging the situation of ×. We are advancing through the artillery fire of the × people. Whenever we arrive at any corner,　our armed comrades must extend their emotional hands to ask us for passes　.

We turned a corner and returned to Lychee Mound. It was already dark, and they had prepared dinner for me. We first held an emergency meeting, distributed the condolences, and decided to have Comrade Yao lead the team and be prepared for emergencies　.

After dinner, all of our staff and the local Baojia leaders, a total of more than thirty people, went to ××× Chen's department to participate in a military-civilian get-together.

### The Situation in Tianjin Shows No Signs of Resolution; The British Government Formulates Retaliatory Measures; If Japan Does Not Repent, They Will Be Implemented

[Reuters, London, 17th] Cabinet ministers who are currently in Beijing for the weekend are maintaining close contact with the outside world to prevent the situation in Tianjin from deteriorating. Foreign Secretary Halifax, who is resting at his private residence in Yorkshire today, is scheduled to return to London tonight. If Japan insists on its demands, the British government will consider retaliatory steps. According to reliable sources, the British retaliation may be: (1) suspending Japan's enjoyment of the "most-favored-nation" treatment under the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty; (2) prohibiting Japanese goods from entering British territory; (3) imposing extremely high import duties on Japanese imports.

[Central News Agency, London, 17th] Foreign Secretary Halifax returned here from Yorkshire this afternoon and is still working in Beijing despite the weekend holiday. This shows the seriousness of the diplomatic situation, as the tripartite negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are underway in Moscow, and the Tianjin incident shows no signs of easing. The Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to meet on Monday to review the general situation.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 17th] Regarding the Far East situation and the tripartite negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, Foreign Minister Bonnet received British Ambassador Phipps this afternoon to discuss them. Afterwards, he also contacted the French Ambassador to Britain, Corbin, by long-distance telephone. It is reported that Britain, France, and the United States are currently informally exchanging views on the Tianjin incident, but responsible persons here attach great importance to the attitude of the United States, which is regarded as a decisive factor in future developments.

[Central News Agency, London, 17th] Regarding the Tianjin incident, cabinet ministers are currently waiting for continued reports. The Prime Minister left Beijing yesterday to　　spend the weekend holiday at　　　　, but he is still maintaining close contact with the Prime Minister's residence at Tang　　　. People close to diplomatic circles here hope that the Japanese government will　completely change its mind, conduct negotiations with Britain, and seek a solution, but if necessary, Britain will definitely take retaliatory measures　. As for the method, the commercial, financial, and foreign affairs departments have been studying it in the past three days and have prepared a report. It is preparing to be submitted to the cabinet for discussion.

[Central News Agency, London, 18th] Officials here stated yesterday that if the Tianjin situation has not improved by the end of this week, the British government may take three possible courses of action: (1) canceling Japan's original most-favored-nation treatment; (2) abolishing the 1911 Anglo-Japanese Treaty, in which case Japan will be out of the great market in British colonies; (3) imposing heavy tariffs on all Japanese imports. Japan's financial capacity　has been greatly affected by the two years of war. If the British government actually implements the above three measures, it will further give Japan's financial position a more serious impact. It is speculated that the authorities plan to issue a statement on this matter in the House of Commons tomorrow. In the past three days, the commercial, financial, and foreign affairs departments have successively discussed various countermeasures to deal with the current situation. The recommendations of the three departments have been drafted in the form of a report. If the Tianjin situation has not improved by the end of this week, the government will take various measures, including the above three methods.

[Central News Agency, London, 17th] Scottish Affairs Minister Colville recently delivered a speech in Milton城, Sutherland, stating that the British government considers the Japanese military's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, China, to be a serious matter. It is hoped that the Japanese authorities will understand this in order to achieve a reasonable solution. As for British military preparations, after recent expansion, the strength is extremely strong, but it should not be　regarded as a threat to any country.

Germany and Italy Secretly Discuss the Far East Situation

[Reuters, Berlin, 17th] The Japanese ambassadors to Rome and Berlin (Shiratatori and Shima, open supporters of the German-Japanese alliance) have recently held multiple meetings with German officials. It is reported that the situation in the Far East, especially the Anglo-Japanese dispute, was the subject of discussion. The Japanese ambassador to Italy arrived here five days ago. The "Foreign Affairs News," which first supported the Japanese military's actions in Tianjin, stated that countries that are ignorant of the times and consistently adopt reactionary foreign policies should know in the future that natural development cannot be prevented by stubborn and autocratic means.

[Reuters, Paris, 17th] The "Radical Newspaper"戰称 states, "According to Italian newspaper opinion, the Tianjin incident is actually the implementation of a plan by the totalitarian countries to destroy the democratic countries. However, the information received by London, Paris, and Washington is not like this. According to diplomatic circles, Japan has decided to limit its actions." However, the "Paris Times" did not dare to make optimistic criticisms. The newspaper stated in an editorial, "Whether true or not, we believe that Berlin and Rome both know that they cannot avoid fighting a war on two fronts. Therefore, they are trying to induce Japan to fall into a de facto alliance with Germany and Italy. The method　is to promote Japan’s apparent self-interest, incite an Anglo-Japanese conflict, and weaken the forces of the democratic countries."

Japan Attempts to Force Britain and France to Stop Aiding China

[Reuters, Moscow, 18th] According to local press criticisms of the Tianjin incident, "The Tianjin incident and other similar incidents involving British expatriates in China are pretexts used by Japan to create disputes. The real reason Japan is taking severe measures now is to drive Britain and the United States out of China and seize foreign concessions in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other ports."

[Central News Agency, Chongbian, 18th] A special dispatch from London on the 18th reported that a correspondent from the Manchester Evening News in Paris stated that one of the aims of the Japanese blockade of the British concession in Tianjin was to force Britain and France to stop transporting military supplies to China through Burma and Annam, to supply the Chinese army to fight against Japan. Therefore, all parties believe that the best way to deal with Japanese intimidation is to strengthen aid to China.

American Newspapers Urge Government to Take Active Action

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] The Republican "Washington Post" recently published an editorial on the situation in Tianjin, China, stating that the United States should not ignore it. The majority of Americans support the government taking more active actions. The problem that is currently occurring in North China is enough to affect the future of foreigners in China. Regarding the Tianjin incident, if Britain and France are forced to yield and accept Japan's demands as the price of stopping the blockade, it will create a precedent of special and significant meaning. The meaning is that the orders issued by Japan will have legal effect throughout the Far East. Foreigners must obtain Japan's tolerance before being allowed to reside in China and do business. Can this be tolerated? Japan's repeated acts of interfering with the legitimate rights and interests of foreigners have always lacked justification, especially this time. Therefore, all signatory countries to various treaties concerning the Far East must take responsibility and resist. In short, the United States has been increasingly confronting Japan in the past two years, and has great sympathy for China. Up to this point, Americans seem to think that in the current situation, the United States must take action.

French Figures Also Advocate Taking a Strong Stance

[Central News Agency, Landes, France, 16th] The French Colonial Issues Association held a conference here this afternoon, chaired by Oudry, the former Governor-General of French Vietnam. He made a speech strongly stating that Japan's actions in China directly threaten the security of French Vietnam. Since the Japanese military occupied Hainan Island, Haiphong Port has been threatened. The best course of action now is to build a military port in Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam, as a base for the French Far East Fleet. Colonial Minister Mandel is already carefully planning this matter. The conference then passed several key points: (1) advocating a strong stance to safeguard the rights that France maintains in the Far East, especially the French Concession and the International Settlement in Shanghai; (2) if the Japanese cause further incidents, Britain and France should prohibit Japanese merchant ships from using their ports in the Far East as a means of retaliation; (3) supporting the proposal to build a naval base in Cam Ranh Bay.

### American Congressmen Debate the Neutrality Act All Day; The House of Representatives Is Scheduled to Discuss It at the End of This Month; There Will Definitely Be a Ruckus at That Time

[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] The new Neutrality Act proposed by Bloom, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has been submitted to the House of Representatives for discussion after being reviewed and passed by the committee, with two reports attached: (1) the report of the majority party on the Foreign Affairs Committee, namely the Democratic Party, in which Bloom compares his proposed new Neutrality Act with the existing Neutrality Act, explaining that the new act does not have any actual arms embargo provisions for belligerent countries, nor does it apply to countries that have entered into armistice; (2) the report of the minority party, namely the Republican Party, in which objections are raised to Bloom's proposal to authorize the president to declare the existence of a state of war and designate war zones, because the power is too broad, and opposition is expressed to the cancellation of the current arms embargo provisions. In addition, Bloom has reportedly decided to ask the House of Representatives to select a date within a week after the 26th of this month to discuss the new Neutrality Act. At this moment, people in the congressional lounge are saying that the Republican congressmen are strongly opposed, and some Democratic congressmen who support isolationism will also join them, but Bloom's proposal will definitely be passed by a vote.

### Goebbels Has Arrived in Danzig

[Haitong News Agency, Danzig, 18th] German Propaganda Minister Goebbels arrived here on Saturday and entered the city theater.

The Japanese Side Actually Said They Did Not Know

[Reuters, Moscow, 17th] It is reported that the Soviet Union has lodged a protest with Japan because the Japanese recently instigated White Russians to forcibly seize the Soviet Consulate in Tianjin.

The 35,000-ton "Duke of York" military ship built by the shipbuilding company is scheduled to be launched in September of this year, and it is expected that the King and Queen will preside over the ceremony at that time.

### British-Soviet Negotiations Are at a Standstill; The German Side Has Repeatedly Transmitted New Soviet Demands; Guarantee the Eastern and Western States of Germany

[Reuters, Moscow, 17th] It is expected that the talks between the British and French representatives and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will continue on Sunday. The British envoy Sterron and the British and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union held talks this morning, but they will not meet with Molotov this week.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 18th] According to a report from Moscow late last night, the British-Soviet representatives' negotiations have been temporarily shelved and there is no progress at all. The British representatives are currently trying to resolve major problems due to the situation in the Far East. It is heard that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's new proposal is that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union must guarantee the eastern and western states of Germany. In other words, not only Belgium, Poland, Romania, Greece　, and Turkey, because these countries have been guaranteed, but also the Baltic countries should be treated equally if they wish to be guaranteed.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 18th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and the British and French diplomatic representatives will continue talks on the tripartite anti-aggression agreement tomorrow.

### The British King Tours St. John's; The Fishermen Give Him a Warm Welcome Again

[Reuters, St. John's, 17th] The British King and Queen landed in Electra today and received the warmest welcome from the local people. The scene was like a fishing village on the coast of Scotland. Dozens of fishing boats were around the pier, and the fishermen were all dressed in neat clothes to welcome the King and Queen. The harbor was quite foggy and there was light rain. The King and Queen felt extremely pleased with the sincere welcome. After the Mayor of St. John's delivered a welcoming speech to the King and Queen, the King laid a wreath at the war memorial. Officials and the administrative committee formally held a ceremony to see off the King and Queen. The King also personally performed the knightly　ceremony, which was a historic first in Newfoundland. Then the King left here at 8 p.m. (standard time) and returned to the country. A guard of honor saluted and saw them off at the shipyard. The warm hospitality of the people of Newfoundland to the King and Queen came to an end.

[Reuters, Ottawa, 17th] Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie returned here today and said in a speech, "I know that the King's visit to the United States and Canada will be a success, but I have not yet fully understood the greatness of this success. After the King's visit to Canada, I have seen the full cooperation of the provinces and cities of Canada, which is truly a great achievement. I have never known such complete unity before."

Small Review

### "The Work of the Wang Clique"

Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th: It is heard that the assassination of Qu Shao Yi, editor of the Shanghai Shen Bao on the 17th, was the work of the Wang clique. Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th: Shanghai report, another seven or eight thugs broke into the Dao Bao on the 17th and opened fire, which is related to the Qu case.

Echoing the atrocities of the Japanese in Tianjin, Wang's henchmen are creating terrorist incidents in Shanghai again!

The targets of the Wang clique's rampant terrorism are the Shen Bao and Dao Bao, and their staff, which are generally trusted to uphold justice, seemingly in an attempt to blind the world. Regardless of how base and shameless their behavior is, the result will only increase the hatred of the Chinese people!

All people with backbone will spit on hearing "the words of the Wang clique." Now, please, countrymen, pay more attention to "the deeds of the Wang clique!"

Deputy Chairman Feng said: "Wang is a piece of rotten meat." Are we still tolerating the spread of germs by this piece of rotten meat to harm the people?

### Moving the Mausoleum South

According to a Central News Agency report, the mausoleum of Genghis Khan has been moved solemnly, passing through Yulin southward on the fifteenth of this month, with personnel dispatched by the central government escorting it along the way.

This news fully proves that under the frenzied invasion of the Japanese aggressors, all Chinese people have united firmly and closely.

For the past two years, the Mongolians have been fighting for the liberation of the great Chinese nation, creating a glorious page in history. This southward move of Genghis Khan's mausoleum further proves the Mongolian people's determination to support the unity of the Chinese nation and the sustained war of resistance. It further proves that all the plots of the Japanese and Mongolian traitors to incite chaos have failed to have any effect. It further proves the bright future of China's war of resistance and national reconstruction.

Even so, we must earnestly and thoroughly realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of nationalism and closely promote equality and cooperation among all ethnic groups in the country. We must, in the shortest possible time, pay homage to the mausoleum of the Mongolian ancestors, pay homage to the mausoleum of the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and raise the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun at the Yalu River!

### Romania Leans Towards Anti-Aggression, Germany and Italy Try Their Best to Intimidate, and Prevent it from Concluding an Agreement with Turkey

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 17th] It is reported that Turkey and Romania will establish a military agreement, and the relationship between the two countries is becoming increasingly close. Romania will tend towards the group of England, France, and Turkey. Therefore, German political circles have issued warnings to Romania. Berlin claims that if Romania concludes a military agreement with Turkey, "the neutrality of the Balkan Entente countries will come to an end." The German United News Agency attacked King Carol of Romania for joining a policy that encircled Germany, and said that Italy would have something to say about it. Today, several semi-official Italian newspapers in Rome warned Romania, saying, "Italy will not tolerate the combination of countries to threaten the freedom of the Eastern Mediterranean."

### Shantou City Under the Cloud of War

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Bai Qun

Due to the tense situation caused by the attempted landing by the Japanese on the 7th and 8th, the already deserted Shantou city has become even more deserted. Many large companies and shops are completely closed. In the morning, only grocery stalls are selling goods. The population has thinned out to only two or three out of ten. Only a few pedestrians are dotted on the road, which is exceptionally lonely. The reporter, braving the slight drizzle, walked on the road and even hearing the bell of a rickshaw seemed hot and piercing.

Military police patrols are very dense. The military police supervision office has also sent several groups of people to check travelers coming from the port to prevent spies and traitors from infiltrating and engaging in activities. After the destruction of the Chao-Shan Railway, the only means of transportation in Shantou is by boat. To avoid attacks by Japanese planes, the ships sailing to various places depart in the early morning and evening. They take safety into consideration but cannot consider convenience, which is an unavoidable method.

Under the suffocating atmosphere of gunpowder, cultural undertakings in Shantou city have also been severely hit. Most schools are closed. Of the few remaining newspapers, Lingdong Min Guo Daily, Shang Bao Xinghua Daily, have also shrunk as much as possible. Printing half a page every day is already righteous, but news materials are also quite scarce, and paving the road has become an issue. However, in times of war, under the dual pressure of financial and material resources, we cannot be too demanding of them. Their ability to persist in their work is still an example of tenacious struggle.

It is an exaggeration to say that the Japanese are advancing on Shantou. The frequent appearance of Japanese planes in Shantou, on the whole, seems to be posturing in coordination with the blockade of the nine ports. The morale and strength of the people of Chao-Shan, under the instigation of Commander Hua, are quite high. I remember that General Weng Zhaoyuan, the founder of the Chao-Shan Self-Defense Corps, said to me when he passed through Huizhou a few days ago that the foundation of the military force of the Chao-Shan people is very solid and will not slacken their enthusiasm and determination to resist Japan due to the terrain. If the Japanese dare to risk landing, they will definitely cooperate with the army to launch a strong counterattack and destroy the Japanese. Finally, the reporter passed by Yu Shanhou and saw a Japanese shop that had been sealed up long ago. Recalling the Shantou of the past, the business and power of the Japanese and Taiwanese were quite strong. Now, the owners of each shop have not only abandoned the business they built with blood and sweat, but some even have to go to the battlefield to die. How cruel is the treatment given to them by the Japanese warlords! Therefore, the Japanese warlords are not only the enemies of China, but also the enemies of the Japanese laborers and small business owners! We must encourage them to resist. The Japanese anti-war slogans of the Political Department of the Kuomintang aroused the reporter's sympathy. Let us rise up and work together to overthrow the Japanese warlords! Japanese people! (Sent from Shantou on the 12th)

Spring and Autumn

### Private Detective

One of the 360 Professions

One day, in an apartment in New York, a woman, introduced by a friend, asked a female worker to try on a corset. The female worker found that this woman could walk, sit, and bend over like a normal person. This woman had sued the car owner in court for being hit by a car, claiming that her body had become paralyzed and demanding compensation for the loss. However, shortly after the female worker left, the court ruled against the plaintiff. The reason was that the female worker was a secret agent sent by a private investigation agency to collect evidence for the defendant's lawyer.

A few years ago, a wealthy man hired a private investigation agency to search for his 19-year-old son. The investigation agency discovered that his son was with a group of dissolute rogues and had become inextricably linked with a waitress. The investigation agency sent someone a few years older than the young man to befriend him and make him focus on music. Before long, this new friend gradually introduced the wealthy man's son into a group of more morally upright friends, finally leading him away from the wrong path, making him a musician in a band, and breaking off his relationship with the waitress.

You can't imagine where private detectives carry out their duties. Once, a real estate developer wanted to buy a piece of land, but the landowner refused to sell. So, he hired a detective to open a pig farm next to the real estate. Before long, the landowner had no choice but to welcome the real estate developer to buy the land.

There was a woman in Washington who suspected her husband of having an affair. Once, her husband went to the patent offices in Philadelphia and Washington on business, but she thought her husband had gone to a hotel with a female secretary. When her husband returned home, she questioned him and made a lot of noise. Although her husband firmly denied it, his wife refused to believe him. The next day, the husband took the matter to a private detective, who agreed to take on the case and told him, "In two days, you will go to the patent offices in Philadelphia and Washington again, and take your wife with you. But you should wear a white suit, tie a blue tie, and put a blue flower in your buttonhole." Two days later, when the couple got off the train in Philadelphia, a man came up to him, took off his hat, and said, "Hello, sir, would you like to put a mark on your luggage, like you did the day before yesterday?" His wife was still a little suspicious. But when they arrived at the patent office in Washington, the waiter at the door said to him, "Mr. Smith, you were just here the day before yesterday, why are you here again today?" Only then did his wife realize she was wrong and immediately asked her husband for forgiveness.

The detective's job, like other businesses, also has experts. The lowest-level personnel are tailers. Their job is to monitor the person being investigated at all times, mostly standing on street corners on rainy days or renting a room opposite the person's residence, looking out the window all day and night with a telescope. After their surveillance mission is completed, they write a very detailed report, which is revised and embellished by the staff in the office before being handed over to the client.

In contrast to the tailer is the enticer. He tries to cater to the person being investigated in every way to gain his trust. Once, a young man whose job it was to entice became acquainted with an elderly man who was being investigated. The two soon became very close, and the old man often invited him to his home to play. In this way, he saw some secret documents.

Whether lovely or hateful, female enticers in detective agencies often operate in ships, trains, hotels, offices, and factories.

The part-time secret agent is a specialist in both tailing and enticement. Their actions are spread throughout American industrial and social organizations. They mix among engineers, clerks, stenographers, and workers, and you can't tell that someone has worked in a factory for twenty years without being suspected by his colleagues. These people submit reports to their superiors every day, and sometimes what they say may just be empty talk for months, but sometimes the result of the report will cause those who are not diligent, dishonest, or troublesome employees to lose their jobs.

Detectives are the first-class figures of private detectives, and their income is the best. One detective once worked as a taxi driver in a divorce case, parking his car in front of the office of the person being investigated. The person being investigated was very satisfied, and every day he had a quick, lovely, and sensible driver to take him to his lover's residence, so he gave him a very considerable tip each time.

The wife of a millionaire in San Francisco suspected that her husband was keeping a singer, so she hired several detectives to tail him. They tracked him to a house outside the city, which was the singer's residence, but they could not enter the house, and none of the servants could be bribed. They cut the telephone line, and one detective pretended to be a repairman to repair the telephone in the house, but found no evidence. Finally, the detectives set up a food stall across the road, selling bread and sausages. The millionaire saw through this trick and decided to move his lover to a secluded place. But to the millionaire's surprise, the movers were also "accomplices" of the detective agency. These movers obtained all the evidence needed for a divorce from some letters and bills on the singer's writing desk.

Who is doing this ingenious work? There are all kinds of people. Whatever kind of person is needed, the private investigation agency will hire them, from linguists to mechanics, from seductive enchantresses to black dockworkers. The little hooligan who wanders around on the street may be spying on your actions for the benefit of his employer. If you are a bank teller, perhaps the well-dressed woman outside the counter is paying attention to your behavior. If you attend a luxurious wedding with all kinds of valuable gifts on display, perhaps a gentleman in a tuxedo is staring at you and all the guests. These are all things you wouldn't expect.

### One Person a Day

Franco, the product of Hitler and Mussolini, has now surprisingly joined the ranks of the victorious dictators. Short stature, a Napoleon-like face, anyone would think he is another demon; but in reality, he does reveal a certain naiveté.

When the Spanish Civil War was raging, an American reporter visited him and had the following conversation:

Q: General Franco, where did you get your cannons?

A: German goods.

Q: What about your planes?

A: Italian goods.

Q: What about your troops?

A: Moors and some foreign mongrels.

Q: So, isn't there anything Spanish in your camp at all?

A: There is something, those who are used as targets, aren't they all Spaniards?

### Sea Storms

— By Captain Lawton, translated by Ji Bi

Previous excerpt: In the autumn of 1914, the German-American ship "Ke Long Bo Qi" was carrying six million gold bars to Germany. Jack, the wireless operator of the Qiukes Company, and Bill, the mechanic, also took this ship to travel in Europe. On the ship, they met the French aviator, Lumon Garot, and Bauer, the German wireless operator on the ship. Jack, while working as a substitute, received a strange message saying that Britain and Germany had declared war and that British warships were coming to intercept the ship. The ship then ran wild aimlessly...

The captain rejected the suggestion to reduce speed, entrusting everything to fate. He said he would rather the ship encounter any danger and be destroyed, but he would not want to be captured by the enemy. A new anger spread throughout the ship. Groups of people gathered again to condemn the captain's attitude. Later, many people went to see the captain again. He treated them very politely, but no matter what, he would not reduce speed and would not turn on the lights.

At this time, Jack was guarding his post. Bill was willing to accompany him through the long night. The captain had already issued an order that all radio messages were forbidden to be sent or received, for fear that the enemy cruisers would find the ship's location.

Therefore, Jack had almost nothing to do, just comfortably leaning in his chair, hanging the earphones on his ears, casually talking to Bill about the current situation, and time passed by. But suddenly, it made him perk up. In the radio, the voices of two ships talking to each other came through. He listened for a while and knew that they were two British ships, "Calidonna" and "Marisa".

But what they said made him a little worried.

"What's wrong again?" Bill noticed Jack's expression. "If the cruisers come, I don't care, because only Germans and Austrians will be taken as prisoners. I'd rather be chased by them."

"This is worse than being captured," Jack said, his voice a little miserable.

"Then what is it?"

"Icebergs," Jack said bluntly.

"At this time, there will be icebergs?" Bill did not believe it, because on the shipping lines, there are very few icebergs blocking the road in August.

"That's the thing. The Calidonna is warning the Marisa that there are very thick icebergs in the northwest. You must remember that the route we are currently sailing is very far north of the usual route, so it is not surprising to have icebergs at this time."

"This is really unlucky! What do you plan to do now?"

"Report to the captain immediately," Jack decided, then got up and took off his earphones.

### Weather Station

The weather in Hong Kong is really unpredictable. Yesterday, the Hong Kong Observatory predicted that the weather would be good. The weather station also said it wouldn't be bad. But, as a result, yesterday, there was wind, rain, clouds, and humidity again. This is what is called ever-changing, unpredictable weather. The only way is to talk less about it in the future, unless there is something particularly noteworthy to report.

Today, there are several good news items to introduce. Every night, leaving the newspaper office and walking on the street, if you are not careful, you will step on people. The homeless compatriots are really densely packed. Now it is said that the authorities have decided to move homeless women, children, and the elderly to refugee camps to work, which is truly a great merit.

The second is that it has been decided to rebuild a new camp for the isolated troops, with an estimated cost of HK$120,000, of which 100,000 yuan in legal tender is subsidized by the Chinese government.

Finally, regarding the armed fight in Tai Hang, it is heard that "the police authorities are very angry and believe that if they are not severely punished, it will not be enough to maintain law and order." Well done. Well done.

I hope to often report such good news in the future.

### Small Problem

There were three greedy people who went into the forest to pick pears, filled their baskets, and returned. At night, A got up to count the pears, divided them into three portions, and there was one left over. He ate it and hid one portion. Later, B also got up, took the remaining two portions, divided them into three shares, and there was also one left over. He also ate it and hid one portion. Later, C also got up and did the same, and there was also one left over. He ate it and hid one portion. At dawn, the three divided the pears equally, and there was also one left over... How many pears did the three pick in total?

This small problem was submitted by the reader Xu Niang. A special reward is offered for answering. Respondents please provide their addresses and send them directly to "Xu Niang, Cai Zhizhai, 8 Beida Street". The first three to arrive will each be given six rice dumplings for the Dragon Boat Festival as a small token of appreciation. Readers, why not go eat rice dumplings! The answer will be published in three days.

### Snippets

A robber broke into a tall, modern bank, pulled out his gun, and said to a teller by the window: "Hey, get all the money out." The teller half-ignored him and pointed to the third window on the left with his pen: "The third window on the left." After he finished speaking, he continued to draw circles on the counter.

The robber was confused:

"What do you mean? Don't you have a lot of banknotes here? Why do I have to go to the third window on the left?"

The teller became impatient:

"You're so annoying. I'm telling you, this is the deposit window. The payment window is over there."

### New Measures for Legal Tender Exchange

— Long Jia Lin

(III) The Significance of the New Measures

Under a managed currency system, the foreign exchange rate of a country's currency is not fixed. If an exchange rate is no longer suitable for the national situation, then forcibly maintaining it is not only useless, but also harmful. Especially in Shanghai, the economic center of the occupied area, the government has lost its ability to govern politically, and there is room for consideration in the unlimited supply of foreign exchange to the black market. We have said this long ago. Recently, with the establishment of the puppet "Huaxing Bank" and the attempt to use the old trick of the "United Reserve Bank" of North China to exchange legal tender for foreign exchange in Central China with counterfeit money, we feel that the government needs to further control foreign exchange (see my book "The Issuance Policy and Future of Huaxing Bank"). It is now heard that the government intends to adjust the exchange rate and stipulate that in the future, legitimate merchants who cannot apply for legal foreign exchange from the Central Bank may purchase foreign exchange from foreign banks without restriction with their order forms. This move is in line with our intentions. Analytically, it has at least the following four values:

1. Adjusting Trade

In recent months, one point is quite noteworthy in the trade of various commercial ports in China, that is, all ports under government control have a trade surplus, while major commercial ports in the occupied areas have a huge trade deficit due to the government's lack of power. This division is very obvious. According to customs statistics, in the first quarter of this year, the main ports under government control, Mengzi had a surplus of 8,121,000 yuan, Qiongzhou had a surplus of 285,000 yuan, Leizhou had a surplus of 2,448,000 yuan, Shantou had a surplus of 5,038,000 yuan, and Wenzhou had a surplus of 4,032,000 yuan. In total, these five places had a surplus of about 20 million yuan, but the deficit in the occupied areas of Shanghai and Tianjin alone reached more than 90 million yuan. Although the government cannot correct this phenomenon directly, it is indeed a clever way to temporarily withdraw support from the foreign exchange equalization fund in the market and then find a suitable exchange rate to stabilize it. Today, the government cannot use political power to control trade in the occupied areas, and this may be the only effective way.

2. Reducing Imports of Japanese Goods

In view of the exhaustion of Japan's gold reserves, in order to absorb foreign exchange, it is doing its best to sell a portion of its surplus goods (that is, those that cannot be sold overseas at a fair price) to the occupied areas of China. But they are unwilling to recover the Japanese yen and military notes in China, so they use these banknotes to exchange for legal tender and then transfer foreign exchange. Recently, the export control in North China has limited the export of certain native products to be settled in foreign currency, which is also the reason. The result of selling surplus goods is a sharp increase in Japanese exports to China, reaching as high as 70 million yuan in the first quarter of this year, ranking first among the values of exports from various countries to China. This huge legal tender reserve for imports has been absorbed by the Japanese. If the Foreign Exchange Equalization Council restricts the purchase of foreign exchange with legal tender, then Japan's exports to China will not be able to obtain foreign exchange (referring to US dollars, pounds, etc.), or will have to be exchanged for foreign exchange at a higher price, then Japanese goods imported into China can be invisibly reduced.

3. Preventing the Acquisition of Foreign Exchange with Counterfeit Currency

The establishment and issuance of banknotes by the "Huaxing Bank" in Central China in the middle of last month was undoubtedly one of the reasons for this new measure. We remember that when the "United Reserve Bank" of North China was established last year, the government immediately implemented the foreign exchange application method. Then, with the establishment of "Huaxing" this time, the government has once again strengthened its control, which is not surprising. Although the current circulation of "Huaxing Bank" banknotes is still limited, we have various reasons to speculate that the "Huaxing banknotes" will inevitably expand in the future. In order to prevent problems before they happen, it is necessary to take precautions against the old trick of using counterfeit banknotes to absorb legal tender to obtain foreign exchange.

### Where Do Young People's Old Hobbies Come From?

— Xiao Ren

A few years ago, someone copied the words of old literati from the "May Fourth Movement" era to guide young people, saying: "If you want good new literature, old literature must have a foundation first!" In the era of the "May Fourth Movement," this was originally a clever trick by old literati. At that time, because the new literature had triumphed, the old literati felt the danger, so they came up with such a sentence, wanting to hold on to the old literature on the one hand, and on the other hand, to send a flirtatious glance to the new literati who had become famous. But now, there are also people saying this, and they are "genuine" new literati. The effect is as if, because some young writers are writing better than them, they are impatient and raise up old literature to intimidate them, meaning: "Don't be complacent, that kind of writing will ultimately not work!" Naturally, this does quite secure their own position, but it really doesn't benefit young people. In the past, old literati used this sentence to lure a group of new figures to climb up, become sages, and talk about "national heritage" in a smoky and murky way, opening a few so-called catalogs of national studies books. But this time, it can only make young people feel dejected and dare not write again. This is called "each generation is not as good as the previous." In the end, besides making young people acquire some old hobbies that even they themselves don't understand, nothing else is left.

At the same time, square poems also appeared. That is new poetry, and the authors are mostly people who have studied foreign languages, and they even declare that they are imitating some kind of foreign style. But readers are very strange and cannot appreciate that kind of art. They have to doze off to read it. This secretly confirmed the prediction of old literati in the past: "Chinese literature is fundamentally different from foreign literature, and imitating foreign literature will make it look out of shape!" And the fact is indeed correct. The poetry has been written into squares, and there is no poetic flavor! Then, it is better to have five-character and seven-character poems, which are much more straightforward. So, some new literati came out and slapped themselves, saying that whether new poetry can be established is really still a question. As a result, old poetry really raised its head. You write one poem, I write one poem, and everyone rolls up their sleeves and starts writing. In the end, besides making young people acquire some old hobbies that even they themselves don't understand, nothing else is left.

I don't know how it happened, but suddenly there was another quarrel between the "Beijing School" and the "Shanghai School." The conclusion of the quarrel was: the "Beijing School" is good, the "Shanghai School" is not good. So, the "Shanghai School" rose up and followed the "Beijing School." From then on, a great trend was produced. "Xingling Literature" is the true literature, and "Aphorism Literature" is the advanced writing style. The ancestor of "Xingling" was originally the Ming people's essays, but soon it expanded to the so-called "rare books." Naturally, this is good, but some "books" are actually not "rare." Later, even Ye Shaoyuan's half-true and half-false collection of poems compiled for his wife became a treasure that young people must read. "Aphorism Literature" is not like the "verbose babbling of vernacular literature," which is certainly also good, as it can save some paper, but the paper saved is used to print classical Chinese poems. And the strangest thing is that the master of the "Xingling" school actually praised "A Rustic's Idle Talk." This trend really makes people dizzy. In the end, it goes without saying that, besides making young people acquire some old hobbies that even they themselves don't understand, nothing else is left.

On the teaching side, the "Beijing School" elders also initiated a movement. If students wrote a wrong word in the exam, the examiners would start writing and ridicule them greatly, and the method of ridicule was also to write old poems. This also made the "Shanghai School" juniors admire them. So, they advocated that young people should look for vocabulary in ancient books. In the end, whether young people found them or not, it seems that no one has investigated yet, but judging from the tone of the advocates, if they don't look for them, they will have points deducted. And in fact, it's really no wonder. Many university entrance exam questions are copied from ancient books, either the "Book of Changes" or the "Book of Rites," as if the more ancient they are, the more suitable they are. In fact, the people who set those questions may not be able to know everything without looking up the books. If they were made to take the exam as students, they might even hand in a blank paper. But in short, the result is, needless to say, besides making young people acquire some old hobbies that even they themselves don't understand, nothing else is left.

These are all the achievements of our celebrities. Calculating it, naturally, it's not much, but these few things are already enough to pull some young people onto the reverse gear.

I agree with Mr. Shangqing's suggestion a few days ago that all teachers should seriously give young people some good guidance. But is it actually possible to do it?

### Winter Night Scene in the Countryside

— Yu Saif

On those plain and snowy days, I used to weave many endless stories by the side of a blazing charcoal stove. And that listener, quietly tilted her head and stared at my face with wide eyes.

I really don't like people staring at my face, so I said impatiently:

"Are my stories painted with colors?"

The listener blushed and said unhappily with a pout:

"Yes, that's why they are painted with colors!" She no longer looked at me. She just used a chopstick to stir the red-hot charcoal.

I put on my coat and quietly walked away.

Under the vast night sky where the wind was rolling the snow and the snow was rolling the wind, I took a deep breath of the clear and cold air. I ran in the white wilderness until my shoes were completely wet, and then I quietly crept back into the house.

The fire in the charcoal stove in the house had gone out; it seemed that those stories I had woven were still tangled in every corner of the house. However, that listener had left, leaving me a note:

--Kezhi, you said that the Japanese devils' aiming is better than ours, I don't believe it! You said that the Japanese devils can use terrain and terrain features, I don't think we can't do it either... Also, your set of weird temper, I don't think the Japanese devils can match you...

These words were written very vaguely and hastily, because they were written in pencil. Under the oil lamp, it took me a long time to make out the handwriting. I couldn't help but laugh to myself.

The bugle sounded, and many dark shadows were lined up on the pure white wilderness. Everyone was silent and solemn, without a bit of noise.

The forest was boasting a lonely and cold tune, the forest was shaking in the wind and clouds, the forest became old, it was draped in white hair, and the night sky gave it a sternness.

All the thatched huts were covered with pure white quilts, and there were no more little red fires inside. ... People were lined up on the pure white wilderness, and a skating-like slippery sound spread far away:

"One, two, three, four..."

On the empty and simple wilderness, the dark shadows of people turned into deep rose color in the snow...

"Stick out your chests, comrades, don't be afraid of the cold! Let's see if there's anything we forgot to bring? Comrades, think about whether the people's door panels are safe?... "

As soon as the sharp voice stopped, it was completely rolled away by the wind and snow. That listener of my story who had just stared wide-eyed! Like all the soldiers, she carried her bag, and she also had a "Browning" hanging on her belt. Seeing me, she said bluntly:

"It is not acceptable to underestimate or overestimate the × people!"

I didn't continue to say anything. I just gently told her: "Comrade, you know it's time for a night march." She lined up in the team.

Snowflakes that fell on our faces would melt before long. The wind dried the snow on our faces, so our faces had bursts of stinging pain.

Icicles had already hung on the treetops. The distant white snow-capped mountains seemed to be watching our group of guys, but I fantasized: I thought, if these huge mountains could sing one day...

So, spring - the projection of this bright and cheerful season - emerged in our rustling steps.

This is how we live.

### The Rushing Spring

— Ding Di

"Glorious spring! May my heart be as new as yours, persistent. Upward, never-ending." - Lonell

Rushing spring, I love its powerful surging.

Not the black, stagnant, moldy green water, not the stagnant waves that are always so still in a narrow river, not as gentle, frivolous and weak as lake water, nor so flat, only spreading to both banks; it surges upward, with bursts of force, surging upward, constantly expanding, the air cannot suppress it, rushing, twisting like a swimming dragon, long days and months dragging through a gray hazy shadow, the sound of the spring plays a constant joyful song in the haze. In the haze, there are golden scales flashing.

There is no time to stop, the water will never dry up. In the mountain streams, in the open valleys, among the withered vines and chaotic leaves on the hillside, go and look for it, there will always be a surging, vast, emerald green ripple, in the deep depths of the secluded and endless small cliffs, hanging down a silver light like a training, shining the sun, and also mixed with the red flowers, small grasses and leaves in the mountains, the rushing waves, expressing the great joy of nature, a high-spirited song of life.

Exploring the endless source of the spring, what you feel is not disappointment, not vagueness, but you will thereby further expand the realm of life.

The sound is like saying that life is a torrent. Life should have a core, which is like saying that when we eat apples, pears, or walnuts, don't they all have a disgusting core? Exploring this core is no better than us casually tearing off a fruit peel, or smashing the hard shell of a dried fruit. Pursue the truth of that life, which is like saying, explore the final source of the spring.

But is it said that truth never exists? I know he has a core. "Pursue that truth."

I say, "I love that spring."

I remember the scenery I saw two years ago.

It was outside the mountain gate of Tiger Spring. New green was dotted on the hillside. A clear echo floated up, and the mountain mist brushed my eyebrows. My eyebrows spread out. In the cracks of the rocks, by the side of the earth cliff, there was a row of trees on the cliff, somewhat irregular, and somewhat chaotic. The shade of the trees covered the spring water, and the sound of gurgling, a continuous sound, pierced through the shade. Like a rope tied to the ear, the sound of the spring water followed me, climbing up the stone steps...

Also in Hangzhou, in the dark and silent camphor forest, going to the Nine Streams and Eighteen Ravines, turning a few corners on the road, I entered a suddenly different realm. The surging contains implicit force, flowing through the narrow cliffs, a few spirals, impacting the mountain rocks, splashing open grains of water droplets. Looking back, I gradually walked away, looking at the white stone, I thought, when should it have started flowing? I calculated for him.

In cold and hot weather, he keeps moving, surging upwards, flowing downwards. Now I will calculate for him, and he is still flowing. Flowing into meandering streams, from the mountains and valleys; low and hidden among the withered branches and chaotic leaves, carrying red boats, and then flowing to the unknown. Maybe returning to the mountains and valleys?

When leaving Hangzhou, calculate for myself, it has been a full two years. The old spring water has already been flowed to who knows where, and even a small fountain made in my goldfish bowl at home has long been destroyed without a trace. Am I disappointed? No, I know that the spring water is still flowing, flowing every minute and every second, tireless and without rest.

Blocking it with stones, maybe you see the misfortune of the spring water stopping temporarily, but when the large amount of spring water bursts through the obstacles, you know that it is more powerful than before. Grasp the long-term life, the spring water will never die.

No one has ever subdued the spring water, we know that many stones have rotted away.

### Three Chapters Written at the Camp

— Jin Xi

The Precious Sword

The precious sword on the wall is long, outside the window is the dreary drizzle, the books on the table, farewell! I want to abandon the dreams of poetry

and the fantasies of songs, go to the scorching hot camp, spit out the flames of resentment, often be with the precious sword, and imitate the laughter of the warriors.

The Camp

Last night's dew was cold; this morning's frost was heavy: the bugle is loudly raised, facing the distant mountains and forests. Shaking off the thin ice on my battle clothes, I shouted: "Distant parents! Your son is waiting for battle, his heart is full of hope."

The War Horse

My war horse follows me, as if it were a good friend, when I charge and am wounded, it stands upright beside me, its nose sniffing me, as if saying: Come on! Warrior, you have not yet repelled the enemy, you must charge again."

### From Chengdu to Xi'an

— Lin Huanping

6. National Heroes

They sleep on the floor in shifts. Only a handful of wheat straw is laid on the floor, and only a felt blanket is covered on top. How can they withstand this freezing weather! At night, coughing sounds rose everywhere. When some cough severely, I suspect they are simply spitting blood. Suffering from hunger and cold like this, it is natural to suffer from coughs. Many warriors, therefore, had to withdraw from the team before they even reached the front line. But there are countless people who value wealth and glory. Even during this period of resistance against Japan, their material enjoyment is as good as heaven. These comparisons lingered in my mind, and infinite emotion stirred my soul, and I lost sleep again that night.

The army got up at four o'clock in the morning, cleaned up the wheat straw, cleaned up once before eating, and after eating, the brothers all went out to the street to gather, then cleaned up again, and moved the moved bed boards and tables and chairs back to their original places, making them clear and clean. The newly trained army after the War of Resistance has also made progress.

I also got up at four o'clock, watched the brothers set off, checked my luggage, asked the porter to take it to the car, and set off from Ningqiang at nine o'clock, heading towards Hanzhong.

The distance from Chengdu to Ningqiang is 440 kilometers, and the distance from Ningqiang to Hanzhong is 125 kilometers. Not far out of Ningqiang County, it is climbing high mountains again. The mountain is called Wudingguan, one after another, towering into the clouds, and very dangerous. When descending the mountain, on the north side of a high peak, we turned sixteen bends on the winding mountain road before reaching the foot of the mountain. It is said that the Yunnan-Burma Road in Yunnan turns twenty-four bends in a mountain ridge before reaching the foot of the mountain, which is probably even higher and steeper than here. From the terrain here in Chongqing, it seems that the vicinity of Chongqing is the top point of the plateau, sloping down to the Yangtze River. After passing through the Rongchang border, it gradually slopes downwards. When it reaches Chengdu, it is a vast basin with no end in sight. After leaving Chengdu and entering the Jianyang County border, there are continuous hills, one layer higher than the other. Wudingguan is the highest point. After that, it gradually slopes downwards, sloping down to the Han River, and from Mian County onwards, it is the vast plain of Hanzhong.

At half past one in the afternoon, the car arrived at Wuhou Town. The town is old and dilapidated and is located next to the Han River. Outside the north gate of the town, there is the Wuhou Temple, which is built in the ancient temple style. Some of the brick and tile walls have already collapsed. On Mount Dingjun on the other side of the Han River, there is the tomb of Wuhou, where Zhuge Kongming, a hero of a generation, is sleeping. At this critical moment of the War of Resistance, lamenting the old traces of Zhuge Wuhou is also worthy of much sighing.

Wuhou Town used to be the seat of the Mian County Government. Years ago, because there were too many bandits, it was often surrounded and looted, so it was moved to Caiyuanzi, more than ten miles north of the town. From Ningqiang County to Mian County, there are many blockhouses along the way. According to a Northeastern comrade who is familiar with this road, there are three reasons why there are so many blockhouses: first, there are many bandits; second, the warlords used to occupy a few counties with a division commander stationed in them, fearing that they would be invaded by others, so they had to take defensive measures; third, the Red Army passed through the border years ago, competing for self-defense. Now, although the situation is completely different, the blockhouses are gradually showing signs of decay. (To be continued)

### Indian Father and Son Bravely Fight Robbers Near Sai Ying Pun Police Station; Western-Clad Robber Escapes With Head Wound; Victim Shot in Jaw, Loses Over 30 Dollars

At five o'clock yesterday morning, an Indian doctor's residence near the No. 7 Police Station in Sai Ying Pun was broken into by a robber, intending to rob. The victim discovered the robbery and bravely resisted. The father and son, along with a friend, fought together and used a kitchen knife to wound the robber. The robber also fired a gun, resulting in the victim being shot in the jaw and losing more than 30 dollars. When the police were called to investigate, the robber was nowhere to be found. Only a pistol was left behind and was picked up by the detectives. The details of the incident are recorded as above.

Incident Location: Near the Police Station

The incident occurred on the second floor of No. 284 Des Voeux Road West, which is close to the No. 7 Police Station. The robbers are rampant and dare to commit robbery there. The location is the residence of Indian ophthalmologist Sama Wenmou Mohammed. The old brother Lin Eye Hospital is located on the ground floor and was founded by Mohammed. The clinic on the ground floor is open to the public. At night, only a maid and a servant guard it. Mohammed's residence is on the second floor, where he lives with his son Anmo Deli. Mohammed also has a Chinese assistant named Chen Shitang, who assists in the clinic during the day and returns to his residence in the back street at night. The place where Chen lives is close to Mohammed's clinic on the second floor, and they can echo each other. The clinic's business is quite developed. Every day, many people come to the clinic to see their eyes, which attracts the attention of robbers.

Not Satisfied With Stealing 30 Dollars

Besides Mohammed and his son, there was also Mohammed's friend Heyazi sleeping in the building the night before, a total of two people. The incident occurred at 4:50 yesterday morning. At that time, everything was silent. Mohammed and his son were in their sleep. At that time, all the doors and windows in the room were locked. Suddenly, a robber broke into the building from an unknown place, first cut off the power lines in the building, and then groped around the walls in the room. Mohammed's coat was hung on the wall before going to bed, and there were more than 30 dollars in cash in his pocket, which was stolen. After stealing the cash, the robber pulled out a pistol and searched Mohammed's bed. Mohammed and his son had already been awakened by the sound of searching, but they saw the robber carrying a pistol and dared not move, pretending to be asleep. The robber thought that the Mohammed's had not woken up and pointed a gun at them and ordered them not to shout, threatening Mohammed to hand over the safe key.

Victim Wakes Up and Fights Back

Taking advantage of the robber's unpreparedness, Mohammed suddenly woke up and pushed the robber hard. His son Anmo Deli and his friend Li Yazi also woke up and fought back. The three of them fought the robber together, helping each other and tangling with each other. The robber, outnumbered, resisted while retreating into the kitchen. The three of them pursued him relentlessly. Mohammed saw the robber holding a pistol and about to fire, and quickly grabbed a kitchen knife and砍向the robber, wounding his head on the spot. The robber then fired four shots, and Mohammed was shot in the jaw. His son helped Mohammed back to bed while shouting for robbery. Only Heyazi was left fighting the robber. At that time, the robber's head had been wounded, and blood was dripping down, but he was still struggling desperately, arguing with Heyazi in the kitchen for a long time.

Robber Escapes After Being Wounded

At this time, Mohammed's assistant Chen Shitang was awakened in his residence by the noise and heard the shouts of robbery. He rushed over frantically. Li Yazi went to the stairs and opened the door to let him in. He initially thought that the robber had nowhere to escape in the 中. Unexpectedly, when he went out, the robber climbed out of the kitchen window and escaped after jumping down. Li Yazi and Chen Shitang returned to the kitchen and found that the robber had escaped. They went downstairs to chase him but were unable to catch up. They immediately reported the robbery to the No. 7 Police Station. Chinese and Western detectives, led by Bang, arrived at the scene to investigate. Nearby residents were all frightened. The police first sent the injured victim to Mary Hospital for treatment. They also investigated the scene of the incident and found a pistol left behind by the robber in the kitchen. There was still one bullet that had not been fired. They also found a pair of yellow leather shoes and socks at the place where the robber jumped out behind the house, and took them to the police station for investigation. The injured Indian Mohammed was not seriously injured. One of his teeth was knocked out. The bullet was removed from the hospital at 4 pm yesterday. There is no major problem. The robber who committed the robbery was about 30 years old and was wearing a suit. The police are strictly investigating and pursuing him.

### Air Defense Authorities Decide to Proceed with Deepening Aberdeen Bay to Allow Warships and Large Vessels to Dock, Dispatching Marine Police to Order the Relocation of Boats and Vessels

Previously, the Hong Kong air defense authorities, considering the deep waters and steep mountains of Aberdeen Bay (i.e., Aberdeen and Ap Lei Chau) suitable for docking warships and as a military port, planned to deepen the bay to facilitate the docking of warships and large vessels. There were widespread rumors that fishing boats and small vessels docked in the bay would be ordered to relocate, with Wong Chuk Hang in Aberdeen designated as the gathering place for them. Now, the air defense authorities believe that deepening the bay is imperative. However, the large and small vessels docked in the bay have not yet moved. A notice was sent to the Marine Police Station, which dispatched two marine police boats on the morning of the 17th to warn the vessels, ordering them to relocate to Wong Chuk Hang. Those who dared to disregard the order and refused to move would be arrested. On the 17th, after receiving the warning, the vessels successively relocated. The authorities will proceed with deepening the bay once all the large and small vessels have been relocated.

### New Territories Crude Industry Association Plans to Develop New Territories Agriculture; Implementation to Begin Step-by-Step Once Sufficient Funds Have Been Raised

The New Territories Agriculture Association of Hong Kong, in order to improve the lives of farmers and enable Hong Kong's agricultural products to achieve self-sufficiency, has formulated a plan to develop New Territories agriculture. However, implementation will begin step-by-step only after raising the proposed credit loan fund of $20,000. According to the association's secretary, Mr. Tie Tesu, the association's activities have often been hindered due to a lack of regular income, and many plans have been forced to be shelved due to a lack of implementation funds. The association's proposed plan for developing New Territories rural areas includes increasing rural production, teaching farmers to adopt new methods of farming, and providing small rural credit loans to enable poor farmers to use the loans to purchase machinery and seeds, etc., to develop agriculture.

### Careless Storage Leads to Theft; A Maid Wins the Summer Lottery, $2,000 in Prize Money is Stolen; Paper Money Hidden Under the Bed Suddenly Disappears; Suspected to be the Work of a Friend of Another Maid

In recent years, the Hong Kong lottery seems to have benefited maids the most. There have been several first prize winners, amounting to no less than two or three hundred thousand dollars. They jointly purchase tickets, each contributing only one dollar or several dimes. After winning, they divide the winnings equally, each receiving tens of thousands of dollars, which can be said to be extremely lucky. However, blessings do not always come without a catch. Careless storage leads to theft. Last year, after a group of maids won the first prize in the spring lottery, they returned to their hometown to thank the gods, only to encounter thieves and be robbed of everything. This time, after the summer lottery was drawn, the first prize of over $80,000 once again fell into the hands of a group of maids. One of the maids, named Zhu Yang (19 years old), lives in a rented bed space at 83 Xiang Street, Kowloon. This time, she received a share of the prize money totaling $2,333, all in hundred-dollar or ten-dollar bills. She put all of it in a rattan basket and stored it under her bed. Unexpectedly, when she woke up at one o'clock yesterday morning, she discovered that the basket had disappeared. Greatly alarmed, she knew that she had been robbed and loudly alerted the people in the house. There are a total of 20 men and women living together, and five of the maids also hold some shares of this first prize, receiving a considerable amount of prize money. After Wu Yang searched and found nothing, she went to the police station to report the case. Everyone in the house has now been summoned for questioning. As a result, no one has been detained. It is now suspected that a friend of one of the maids, who came to visit a few days ago, learned during the conversation that Zhu had a large sum of money stored away. Perhaps tempted by the sight of wealth, they secretly stole it. The person is now also missing. It is reported that Zhu also won about a thousand dollars in the spring lottery this year.

### Graduation Examination Measures for Registered Secondary Schools in Hong Kong; Superintendent Zhang Distributes Them to Each School for Preparation

All registered secondary schools in Hong Kong, according to the order of the Guangdong Education Department, are scheduled to hold graduation examinations from June 26th to July 4th, as reported in previous news. Superintendent Zhang received detailed measures regarding the graduation examination sent from Shaozhou on the 17th and immediately distributed them to each school to follow the various measures set by the department.

The rest is handled according to the above rules.

11. If a certain subject is required for the graduation examination, but the student borrowing from the area has changed the score of that subject, and it is included in the unpaid grade, the "Graduation Examination Grade" of that subject will be the "Graduation

### Hainan Vocational School Held a Basic English Speech Contest Yesterday

Excellent Results Achieved Using Eight Hundred and Fifty Basic Words

As the summer vacation is approaching and the seasons are changing, the vast student population has a desire to appreciate the scenery of the country and schools. The society is also very willing to know about these materials.

Yesterday, the reporter took advantage of the invitation from Hainan Vocational School on Tai Po Road, Kowloon to attend the English speech contest of the Basic English Department of the school's Vocational Supplementary Class. I went to the school before 12 o'clock to visit. When I arrived, I saw that the competition had already started. An atmosphere of inquiry filled the classroom. The students all used the 850 basic words made by British O Gden to give speeches. After several months of training, they have achieved quite good results. The topics of the speeches of each competitor include "A Comparative View of Chinese and English Learning," "Determination to Win the Anti-Japanese War," "Health and Reading," etc., covering many aspects. Mr. Liu Weige, a famous English professor from John's University, was invited to preside over the evaluation. As a result, the male students Liang Hanji and Zhang Xianhong, and the female student Lu Ruizhen won the awards, and each received valuable book prizes. At the same time, Mr. Liu also gave a speech on "The Necessary Conditions for Learning Basic English," elaborating a lot on the methods and experience of learning English. The participants were all very excited for a while. According to Mr. Fang Xiaoyue, the principal of the school, "According to the experience of running this course for several months, I feel that this kind of basic English is a rational crash course, but scholars must also have considerable determination and diligence. The more crash courses, the more effort must be doubled.

The school will add a general junior high school department after the summer as a basis for entering the vocational high school of the school. Fang said, "Because I feel that junior high school students with a not very good foundation are entering a specialized vocational high school, and both teaching and teaching feel difficult. Therefore, a general junior high school department is now specially set up, hoping to be a good foundation stone. At the same time, a summer class is attached to tutor the students in this department, without charging extra fees."

Regarding the feelings of vocational schools, Fang also said, "Recently, the Third National Education Conference decided to increase the establishment of vocational schools for overseas Chinese education. This resolution is very valuable. As far as Hong Kong is concerned, the children of overseas Chinese feel difficult every year due to the problem of further education, and in this extraordinary period, people who are displaced and lose their studies and jobs are in serious trouble, all of which need practical relief. The so-called out-of-school people are those who have graduated from elementary school or junior high school, or who have such a considerable level that they do not want to spend more energy on ordinary subjects, and are willing to quickly obtain a specialized vocational skill, and are wandering on a fork in the road for this problem. The so-called unemployed people are those who are determined to engage in a profession, who are suffering from the lack of a skill, or who have been in school for many years, but are empty and have nothing to gain, and although they want to take a job, they suffer from the lack of tools to overcome it. These people, the former should enter vocational schools, and the latter should enter vocational supplementary classes. Recently, Mr. Gibson, an American vocational education expert, said in his book "American Extracurricular Vocational Guidance" that education is guidance rather than indoctrination. Not many students in society can go to school, and schools mostly focus on a large amount of homework indoctrination, and do not pay attention to individual skill guidance. This is wrong. What Gibson said about the situation in the United States is also a lesson for us to move towards this new trend in education. In addition, the famous academic system of Hu Anding of the Song Dynasty in the history of education in our country has a so-called 'governance' department, which is equivalent to the current vocational education. His spirit of learning and applying immediately and responding to world affairs is also a good model for education in the past. These are all things that vocational educators should pay attention to and strive for."

In addition, it is heard that the school's vocational supplementary class has added a Chinese shorthand course. Chinese shorthand is urgently needed in society. However, those who want to learn this technology are still suffering from no way to enter. Except for the Chinese shorthand class of the Shanghai China Vocational Education Association in the past, there is no such teaching. The school has recently hired Huang Chuanbin, the inventor of Chinese shorthand, as a professor. Huang's invention has been registered by the Ministry of Education and is completely in accordance with the national language standard. It is the most effective subject in Chinese shorthand. At the same time, those who are not familiar with the national language can also take this opportunity to learn the national language. It is said that many people in various social institutions should learn.

As for the school's vocational high school department, in addition to the journalism and agriculture departments being run as usual, many vocational supplementary classes have now been added, such as the family industry class, the accelerated agriculture class, the journalism supplementary class, the Chinese shorthand class, and the Chinese and English public document class, etc. Enrollment will be held at the same time in the coming days, and tuition fees will be reduced as much as possible, and many free places will be expanded to provide relief. The professors invited are all carefully selected experts with special experience.

### Student Relief Association: Girls' Student Corps Officially Established Yesterday; Inaugural Meeting Held at the YMCA; National Oath Ceremony Held Simultaneously

Students from various girls' schools in Hong Kong, feeling the need for a closely-knit organization to promote women's rights, after a long period of preparation, the Girls' Student Corps of the Hong Kong Student Relief Association was finally established. Yesterday morning at eleven o'clock, the inaugural meeting and national oath ceremony were held in the auditorium of the YMCA. Ms. Wang Xiaoying, a leader in the women's movement, was invited to preside over the oath and give a speech. Several hundred guests and members of the Girls' Student Corps attended. The meeting's proceedings were as follows: (1) Formalities; (2) Chairman announced the reason for the meeting; (3) National Covenant Oath; (4) Speeches by representatives from various women's circles; (5) Awards for membership recruitment competition; (6) Singing; (7) Report on the organizational process; (8) Open speeches; (9) Election of officers; (10) Shouting slogans; (11) Adjournment. The details are recorded below:

Women's Circles Unite; Liberation Struggle

Chairman Liang Huanxiao began by announcing the reason for the meeting, stating briefly that in today's second stage of the all-out war of resistance, the establishment of the Girls' Student Corps has a significant meaning and mission. In the past, women's organizations lacked a solid organizational foundation. In particular, female students must bear the heavy responsibility of organizing lower-class women who have not received education. However, Hong Kong female students have a particularly strong feudal mindset due to their unique environment. Therefore, the most crucial tasks after the establishment of this Corps are to develop the women's movement, support student movements, and promote collective living. It is hoped that under the leadership of women's pioneers and teachers, efforts will be made for the nation and the country. There are many female students in Hong Kong, but only over two hundred have joined this Corps. In the future, continued efforts are needed to achieve greater results, and so on. After the speech, the national oath was taken, presided over by Ms. Wang Xiaoying and witnessed by Student Association Chairman Li Zhengyao. All members raised their right hands and recited the oath, the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic.

Ms. Wang Xiaoying's Speech: Hopes for the Girls' Student Corps

Immediately afterwards, speeches began. Ms. Wang Xiaoying's speech stated briefly that she was extremely happy to see such a great women's organization established in Hong Kong. Based on her decades of experience in the women's movement, she would like to share with everyone that there are two weaknesses of those who have been engaged in the women's movement in the past: one is being too eager for leadership, but every women's organization cannot produce a large number of leaders, and bad practices arise from this; the other is not criticizing people's actions face to face, but whispering behind their backs, which will inevitably cause adverse effects. Therefore, today she has three hopes for the Girls' Student Corps: (1) After today's election of officers, those who are leaders should lead by example, avoid "showing off", and sincerely guide the public; (2) All members should treat public affairs as their own; (3) Understand the importance of their responsibilities and engage in practical work after the establishment, and not just talk empty words. In short, everyone should know that as citizens of the Republic of China, they should understand their due obligations and strive for the status of women with all their strength, and so on. Following this, Li Peiwo, representatives from the Women's Department of the Morning Mirror Society, representatives from the Women's Department of the Seamen's Union, and Li Zhengyao of the Student Relief Association spoke successively, expressing their gratification at the establishment of the Girls' Student Corps and hoping that it would initiate and promote the women's movement in Hong Kong.

Awards for Membership Recruitment Competition; Li Xiuqiong Wins First Place

Immediately afterwards, awards were given for the membership recruitment competition, which included two categories: number of members recruited and funds raised. In terms of the number of people recruited, the champion was Li Xiuqiong (Lizhe), the runner-up was He Xiuyun (Taoxiu), and the third place was He Zihuan (Zhengfeng). In terms of funds raised, the champion was Li Xiuhuan, the runner-up was He Xiuyun, and the third place was Liang Huanxiao. Ms. Wang Xiaoying presented the awards. Afterwards, the chorus team of the Four Women's Associations' Training Class performed, and the atmosphere became tense. Then, Lin Yuping, a member of the Girls' Student Corps, reported on the organizational process, followed by the election. Liang Huanxiao was elected as the corps leader, and Lin Yuping was elected as the deputy corps leader. Li Bing, He Xiuyun, Li Xiuqiong, Chen Biting, Mo Wanzhen, Mai Huizhen, Li Yanhua, Li Huiwen, Huang Hui and other nine people were elected as executive members of the general corps headquarters. Around 2 p.m., slogans were shouted and the meeting adjourned.

### Feat of Beauty: Sailing Across the Atlantic; Sailboat Built in Hong Kong, Departure in Mid-November

American navigator Ke Kenni arrived in Hong Kong two months ago, planning to build a sailboat in Hong Kong for the feat of crossing the Atlantic Ocean back to the United States. After Ke arrived in Hong Kong, the plan for the proposed sailboat had been finalized, and construction began at the Yakin Shipyard in Causeway Bay. The style of the sailboat built by Ke himself is similar in appearance to the famous Fuzhou sailboats of China, while the interior is similar to that of a modern yacht, measuring ninety-six feet in length, twenty-four feet in width, and one hundred and twenty tons in net weight. According to Ke, the ship has not yet been named and is expected to be completed by mid-November of this year. As for the future navigation plan, it is planned to first travel around the South China Sea for about seven months before arriving in Singapore. After a short stay in Singapore, it will sail past the Cape of Good Hope and the northeast coast of South America before heading to the Bahamas. Fifteen Chinese sailors have been hired, and in addition to himself and his nephew, there will be three or four American crew members. They will come to Hong Kong from the United States after the ship is built, it is said.

### Our Army Counterattacks Jiangmen and Xinhui; Major Battle About to Unfold; Once Charged into Huimin Gate and Engaged in Close Combat; Our Mechanized Units Arrive on the Xinhe Line

(Changsha Express News) Our army on the Jiangmen, Xinhui, XinKai, JiangFo lines has launched a counterattack on Jiangmen and Xinhui. On the 16th, it once assaulted Xinhui City, and fighting continued on the 17th. Our morale is high, and we have won successive victories. The enemy is terrified. Currently, our large army is still moving to the front lines to participate in the battle. It is expected that a major battle will unfold in that area. The military situation is recorded below:

Counterattack on Xinhui City; Fighting Continues

On the 17th, our army guarding the Shadi, Dayunshan, and Kuifengshan areas continued to attack the enemy positions. Our artillery also displayed great power, covering the attacking troops and constantly bombarding the enemy. The enemy in Xinhui City also fired artillery to resist stubbornly. Fighting continued. However, the enemy, feeling threatened by our artillery fire and the bravery of our troops, was extremely frightened and only dared to defend to the death, not daring to charge out to meet the battle. According to telegrams from the front, certain regiments of Deng Longguang's forces have arrived in Daze. On the 17th, they joined the front lines alongside Yang Jigan's Security Forces to advance towards Xinhui City. Large-scale fighting will continue to unfold. On the evening of the 17th, our rapid advance team charged into Huimin Gate and engaged in close combat with the enemy, holding out for twenty minutes and eliminating twenty or thirty people. However, due to being an isolated force, it was easily ambushed by the enemy and automatically withdrew.

Mechanized Units Deployed for Combat

The military authorities in the western region have long been determined to counterattack Jiangmen and Xinhui. It has been learned that some of our mechanized units have recently arrived on the Xinhe Road and are distributed in the Jinggen and Dugen areas, fully armed and ready to attack the enemy. It has been learned that the enemy has detected our army's renewed attack and is busy replenishing supplies, so the fighting on the Xinhe Road has been relatively quiet. Also, on the night of the 16th, our guerrillas lurking between Jiangmen and Xinhui carried out large-scale activities, destroying many sections of the Ningyang Gangzhou West Road and destroying several enemy telegraph poles, cutting off enemy military transportation and coordinating with our army's counterattack on the outer lines.

### Enemy Impersonates Our National Army; Harasses the Populace; Fourth War Zone Ordered to Strictly Guard Against

(Shaoguan Express News) It has been reported to the Fourth War Zone Command by Commander Zhang of a certain army that the enemy in the Conghua Taipingchang area of northern Guangdong is wearing our military uniforms and carrying out activities everywhere. The insignia are marked with three kinds of characters: "Chinese Revolutionary Army," "Guangdong Revolutionary Army," and "National Revolutionary Army." It is feared that the ignorant masses will be deceived and fooled, which will greatly affect our army's reputation and operations. The War Zone Command issued a special notice to commanders of all levels and guerrilla commanders yesterday, ordering them to inform their soldiers and the populace to be aware and strictly guard against being misled by the enemy's poisonous scheme and to send personnel at any time to inform the military and civilians within their jurisdiction, exposing the enemy's conspiracies to prevent the enemy's scheme from succeeding.

### East River Guerrilla Warfare; New Developments Expected Soon; Xiang Hanping in Charge of Anti-Japanese War on the South Bank; Enemy Building Fortifications Along the Shilong Coast

[Shaoguan Express News] Acting Commander Zhang formally ordered yesterday that the guerrilla columns of the Third and Fourth Districts be placed under the command of Deputy Commander and Director Xiang of the □ Group Army, with Chi Zhongkuan relieved of his concurrent post as commander of the East River South Bank Detachment. The Eighth Security Regiment, led by Deputy Commander Zhai Rongji, will continue its forward mission and remain under the command of Director Xiang. The operational areas have also been delineated, with the area below Heng of the East River being the responsibility of the Guerrilla Command Post and the north bank of the East River being under the command of the Sixty-sixth Army. However, for the convenience of operations, the Third Column of Luo Fengxiang's forces, currently on the north bank of the East River, will temporarily be placed under the nearby command of the Sixty-sixth Army and will still be the responsibility of Director Xiang.

Internal Appointments; Commanders at All Levels

The organization of the Guerrilla Command Post and its internal commanders have also been fully determined and appointed. The Command Post will be divided into three sections: Staff, Adjutant, and Quartermaster, and a Political Training Office. Zhang Wen will be the Chief of Staff, Yang Youmin will be the Chief of the Staff Section, Lin Zhuliang will be the Chief of the Adjutant Section, Huang Xianting will be the Chief of the Quartermaster Section, and Xiong Lue will be the Senior Advisor. Chen Xinrong and others will be appointed as Advisors. The personnel of the Political Training Office will be appointed separately, and it is stipulated that the salaries of the guerrilla columns of the One, Three, Four, and Six Districts will be distributed by the Command Post starting in June to ensure uniformity.

Enemy Troops in Shilong; Building Major Fortifications

On the 16th and 17th of this month, enemy military vehicles traveled back and forth on the GuanTai and GuanLong lines, all covered with black canvas tarpaulins. According to reports from the Strike Guerrilla Team, there are currently about 900 enemy troops in Shilong, with more than 400 enemy troops stationed in the town, including more than 100 cavalry, more than 100 artillery, and 200 infantry. Their unit numbers are Qiteng and Lai Tian. There are more than 300 enemy troops stationed in Xihu Jingshan, with more than 20 artillery, and their unit numbers are Nakajima and ZuoDao. In addition, there are 200 troops from the Kawada unit in the northeast. Five or sixty enemy speedboats and electric boats are patrolling the river, appearing to be ready to take advantage of the rising tides.

Enemy Compels Populace; To Be Driven by Them

In addition, the enemy troops in Guancheng are forcing our populace to participate in military service to be driven by them. In addition to conscripting villagers to organize fake self-defense teams, joint defense teams, and plainclothes pistol teams, they are also organizing a fake "Pacification Army," conscripting able-bodied men who have not yet escaped, with He as the captain appointed by the enemy. It has been learned that the fake army has recently been deserting due to the enemy's failure to pay military salaries. Makino, the enemy commander stationed in Guancheng, was furious and ordered He's dismissal, with Zhang appointed to succeed him. Also, the enemy chieftain recently forced Zhang, the head of the Dongguan fake security council, to forcibly conscript able-bodied men from various shops and escort them to Guangzhou for training. In recent days, more than a hundred people have been escorted by the enemy, it is said.

### Sanshui Enemy Rampages; Artillery Destroys Dozens of Villages in the Northern District; Thousands of Refugees Flee to Lubao

[West River Decisive News] Lubao, which belongs to Sanshui County, is located on the Xiaobei River channel. Since the enemy army occupied various places in the southwest of Sanshui, it has been thinking of taking further advantage. Recently, the enemy army's Matsuno unit in the West River carried out so-called "sweeping operations" in order to "suppress" the guerrillas in the nearby villages. On the 12th and 13th of this month, they wantonly bombarded and harassed the villages, and dozens of villages, including Lucun, Yangmei, Nanbian, Baoyuetang Langang, and Xinliangting, were bombarded and destroyed. Among them, Lucun, Yangmei, and other six villages were particularly severely damaged and have become scorched earth. The villagers in these villages, realizing that the enemy army is so brutal, have fled to Lubao. According to statistics from the Lubao Police Station, about 1,300 refugees have entered in the past ten days. County Magistrate Tian Zhuseng has taken measures to provide relief to the refugees. Furthermore, Lubao is a place coveted by the enemy army, and enemy aircraft come to bomb it from time to time. In order to prevent the refugees from suffering losses from air raids and to prevent Chinese traitors from taking advantage of the opportunity to mingle with the enemy, the police station was specially ordered yesterday to cooperate with the garrison troops to strictly investigate and register all incoming refugees in order to prevent traitors from taking the opportunity to infiltrate and carry out activities, it is said.

### Earth-Shaking; Our Army Counterattacks Wenchang City; Perishing Together with the Enemy; Soldiers Prefer Death to Dishonor, Almost the Entire Battalion Dies Heroically; Wang Yi Requests Commendation of the Loyal Martyrs to Inspire Others

(Xuwen Express News) In the late part of last month, our army on Qiongzhou Island launched a counterattack on the enemy and once recovered Wenchang City. Among them, there is a moving and tearful event that will be eternally remembered in the history of the nation. In that battle, more than 400 enemy troops were killed, while more than 300 of our attacking troops almost all died heroic deaths, with only 32 returning to the team. On the 25th of last month, a certain battalion of our security regiment received an order to attack. The entire army was invigorated and set off from Jiaji City at dusk and advanced towards Wenchang County overnight. Because of our familiarity with the local terrain, we detoured, and the enemy did not notice. Around 5 a.m. the next day, we had approached the outskirts of the city and were discovered by an enemy sentry, who fired at us. However, he was killed by us in an instant. Rushing forward, we first attacked the enemy camp at the county middle school. The enemy was caught off guard and hastily fought back. Our hand grenades rained down, and most of the more than 200 enemy soldiers were killed. Seeing that the great success had been achieved, we divided our forces and searched for the remaining enemy troops in the city. As soon as we encountered enemy troops, we stabbed them to death. However, soon enemy reinforcements arrived and surrounded the city on all sides. Because we were outnumbered, we used machine guns as vanguards to cover the infantry's breakout. Halfway through the assault, we were intercepted by the enemy. Under the command of Battalion Commander Liu, the company charged back and forth, killing many enemies. Then, the enemy gathered more and more troops and surrounded the company. Realizing that there were no reinforcements, Battalion Commander Liu desperately charged out, fighting and retreating, and only 32 people returned to the original location. All the others sacrificed their lives. More than 200 people who could not break out of the city launched repeated attacks, but all failed. Casualties were heavy. More than 80 people retreated to a high-rise building in the city to resist. The enemy tried to induce them to surrender, but the valiant soldiers were determined to dedicate their lives to the country and vowed not to submit. The enemy then launched an attack, and we defended ourselves by relying on the terrain. The fighting was fierce, lasting for five hours. Only 14 warriors remained on our side. Knowing that nothing could be done, but unwilling to be humiliated by the enemy, they all committed suicide by slitting their throats. At the end, they still shouted Long Live the Republic of China, and the enemy chieftain was moved. Wang Yi, the garrison commander of Qiongya, believes that the battalion's loyalty and courage in their duty are commendable, and the heroic deaths of the warriors are especially shocking to heaven and earth and move ghosts and gods. He has sent a telegram to Commander Zhang requesting that the personnel who contributed and the martyrs who died for the country be commended to encourage others, it is said.

### Yesterday's Public Baseball Game; South China Mr. Loses After Winning; You Bei Defeats Hong Kong and Sets a Scoring Record

Yesterday, under the scorching sun and oppressive heat, two public baseball games were held as scheduled. In the first game, South China Club unfortunately lost to the Western Club by a score of 5 to 10. The reason for South China's defeat was that the coordination was not close enough, and Ye Beihua and Zhu Guolun performed poorly. However, catcher He Xiancheng was very skilled, and pitcher Zheng Kangyong lacked experience. However, their most fatal injury was that they conceded six points in the third inning. However, although South China lost this battle, there are still issues. It is said that South China will appeal to the Federation. This issue occurred in the fourth inning.

In the fourth inning, when South China was on the offensive, it was Situ Bi's turn to bat and he got a "free first base." He Xiancheng continued to get on base. When Situ Bi stole third base, the pitcher threw the ball to the third baseman to stop him. The umpire Liu Guozhang ruled that Situ Bi had safely reached the base, but the chief umpire, De Jili Shi, said that Situ Bi would be killed and ruled him out. South China protested in vain and claimed to appeal. South China was disheartened by this setback and had no intention of fighting. Huang Yaodong and Wu Bangzhen were killed successively, and this inning collapsed.

In the fifth inning, Tang Rongguang first got "free in innings" and took advantage of Zhu Guolun's "safe hit" to advance to second base. Zheng Kangyong swung his bat with great power, got a safe hit, sent Tang Rongguang back to home base, and scored one point. Pala Ci even threw "four balls" in a row, letting Chen Yutian board first base. At this time, Zhu, Zheng, and Chen occupied third, second, and first base respectively, forming a "full base" advantage. When Ye Beihua came to bat, he hit a high fly ball. Zhu, Zheng, and Chen risked running the bases. Unexpectedly, the high fly ball was caught by Birodu, who first eliminated Ye Beihua, then threw to first base to kill Yutian. Yaluweili threw the ball to the catcher and intercepted Zhu Guolun, resulting in a "triple play." South China then left the field dejectedly. Western Club scored four points in the fourth, fifth, and sixth innings, plus six points in the third inning, for a total of ten points. South China only scored five points in the entire game and was defeated.

In the second game, You Bei played against Hong Kong Club. There was not much to see. Hong Kong Club made a lot of mistakes, and both offense and defense were improper, resulting in a one-sided game. You Bei team finally won by 23 to 0. It can be said that they broke the scoring record for baseball in Hong Kong over the years. The results of yesterday's games are recorded below.

### From Ancient Greece to the Various Aspects of the Olympic Games

— Ding Lao

A Precious History of Sports

(2) Daius of Sparta, a three-time winner of the games, was arrested for committing the great crime of rebellion, but the citizens voted to spare him from the death penalty.

(3) Callias, because he won first place in the horse race and the excellent performance of his fourth horse finishing second, was ranked equal to those who restored the freedom of the country.

(4) An old man named Dagosas had two sons who both won victories. He was so overjoyed that he died of happiness.

Criticism of Greek Sports

First, regarding the accusations of philosophers against the winners of the games, as mentioned above, the winners of the Olympic Games could enjoy such glory and be so loved by the people, but this also aroused the doubts of philosophers. Because in Greece during the heyday, there was freedom of speech, and the spirit of opinion was critical of the games. The most fair critique was from the philosopher (Xenophanbe) 570-480BC, who was born in Colophon in Asia Minor. He criticized the gods generally believed in at the time without any scruples. He believed that the thoughts of gods were definitely not like those of humans, and that the winners of the games were not incarnations of gods. It was absolutely impossible to know in advance who would win. He himself had rich experience in sports and was not just standing by and talking nonsense. He only felt that this blindly enthusiastic thought of sports contained dangerous elements, so he said, "She feels that being excellent in sports is not the happiness of life. The reason why humans are superior to dogs and horses lies in the reputation gained from intelligence. Otherwise, it is just a traditional and foolish habit. For example, being good at boxing, wrestling, pentathlon (the pentathlon at that time was running, wrestling, jumping, javelin throwing, and discus throwing), and running fast may be a matter of reputation, but no country has become strong because of this. Winners may satisfy the desires of the citizens, but there is no fact that the citizens have benefited from it." Of course, no one paid attention to him in the crowd who were enthusiastic about sports. A hundred years later, Curipidei influenced him, "Sparta promoted national defense and rewarded sports, which cannot be regarded as active promotion of physical education." At this time, the Greek games were in a golden age of prosperity, with no professional athletes or professional disputes. Philosophers had keen senses and sharp observations, and faintly discovered the seeds of decline lurking in the shadow of the competition, and sowed the seeds of national demise.

Second: Regarding the results of the games, the Greek records are untrustworthy, because they proved that the excellence of the athletes was a manifestation of divine power, and deliberately boasted to their conquered slaves to make them tremble and dare not betray. For example, Phaylles' long jump was eighteen meters, Skylliao's diving record was five kilometers, and even Sparta's Fobas traveled a thousand miles a day, and the strong Milar killed a cow with one punch at the age of four, which became a myth.

Third: Regarding the theory of physical education; the multitude of sports equipment now is something that the Greeks could not have dreamed of. The same is true for the research of theory. For example, the physiologist Platon, who was known as a great scholar at the time, only wrote casually based on his feelings. Even Aristatles, who was called the father of science, said that muscles were only materials filled between bones and should not be regarded as motor functions. In short, ancient Greek physical education was only due to the grace of natural geography, and it was an activity of the childhood of mankind. Therefore, it only had experience but no scientific research, and its implementation was only limited to a small number of nobles and not popularized to the majority of the people. Once the nobility declined, physical education also ended.
