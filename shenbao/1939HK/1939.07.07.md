### Second Anniversary of the War of Resistance: Chairman Chiang's Address to the Nation's Military and Civilians. He Points out that the Day of Victory is Approaching, Based on Two Years of Actual Events. He Denounces Traitorous Scoundrels for Betraying the Party, the Nation, and Selling out the People. He Encourages Chinese Sons and Daughters to Step Forward on the Bloodstained Footprints of the Martyrs.

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 6th] Chairman Chiang issued an address to the nation's military and civilians on the second anniversary of the War of Resistance. The original text is as follows: Soldiers and compatriots of the entire nation! Today is the first anniversary of our War of Resistance. Compared to this day last year, the war zones have expanded, and the battles have become more intense. Our national military and civilians have an even stronger and more courageous resolve to sacrifice for the defense of our country. The weaknesses of the [enemy] are becoming more and more apparent day by day. Because of this, their desperate struggles are becoming more and more rampant, and their revolutionary war's treacherous schemes and poisonous plans are emerging endlessly. Our battle is to defend our independence and survival and to uphold public justice and righteousness. The revolutionary war has no time limit. We must carry out our purpose of resisting aggression and building our country! We must overcome thousands of difficulties and dangers and move towards the goal of ultimate victory! I think of the heroic sacrifices of the martyrs who died for their country, the brave labor of the soldiers at the front, the displacement of countless people, and the grief and pain of our suffering compatriots... We mourn the dead, and we must not forget the responsibilities of those who survive. We recognize the pain and danger of the entire nation, so each of us must be determined to work hard to avenge this great shame and complete our sacred mission. On this tragic and great anniversary, I, Chiang Chung-cheng, would like to say a few simple words to the soldiers of the country and our compatriots at home and abroad.

On July 7th last year, I explained the situation and future of the War of Resistance to the nation's military and civilians and pointed out the tasks we should undertake. I will not repeat what I have already said today, but it is still sufficient to provide our soldiers and compatriots with material for reflection. I ask the nation's military and civilians to reread this message and compare what was said at that time with the reality of today, a year later. This will further prove that what I said is entirely accurate.

First, let's talk about ourselves. We have gone through several hardships and trials this year, but our will is becoming stronger and stronger as we fight. The spirit, will, and actions of our national people are united more thoroughly under the Three Principles of the People. The entire nation is willing to die for the War of Resistance and to strive to complete the national revolution and establish a country based on the Three Principles of the People. We have a clear understanding of the country's intentions and an unlimited optimism about the future. The entire country is fighting forward with one heart, and we will not hesitate to die for the cause. The results of our battles on the battlefield are greater than in the early stages of the resistance. The activities of the [enemy] are more courageous and agile than in the previous year. The efficiency of all work related to resisting aggression and building the country has improved. In particular, the general public's awareness of the War of Resistance is higher and more determined. Recently, the [enemy], exhausted and running out of strength, has been indiscriminately bombing our cities and burning and killing our people everywhere. The result is only to strengthen our hatred of the enemy and the puppets, and our determination to win the War of Resistance to the end.

In short, many of our shortcomings have been substantially corrected. The concerted efforts of our military and civilians have indeed made progress compared to last year. This is something that I, in my position as commander-in-chief, should feel excited and gratified about for the nation and the people. Looking at the international situation, the application of the sixteen articles of the covenant, which all countries had been hesitant to use a year ago, was passed this year. The League of Nations has determined the [enemy] to be an "aggressor." Governments, people, and public and private organizations of friendly countries around the world are either opposing aggression or providing assistance to China, whether it is providing aid supplies, medical assistance, refusing to transport [enemy] goods, or refusing to buy [enemy] goods. All of this has been demonstrated more enthusiastically this year. The number of people who understand us and sympathize with us has increased tenfold or a hundredfold. The relationship between some friendly countries and us has improved further. Material transportation and technical assistance are more active and open, and no longer subject to hesitation. Not only is their sympathy for us growing stronger day by day, but their aversion to and opposition to the [enemy] are also becoming more and more apparent day by day. We are, of course, grateful to the governments and people of friendly countries around the world for their assistance, but we are especially gratified that the forces of public justice and righteousness are rising day by day.

Let's see what the situation is with the [enemy]. The first thing I want to tell our compatriots is that since the Lugouqiao Incident, the [enemy] has invaded our country up to July 7th last year, a total distance of 1,800 kilometers. But from July 7th last year to today, this year, they have only advanced 310 kilometers. In the same amount of time, they have added several times more troops, but the results they have achieved are several times less than in the previous year. Then, the degree to which their military strength is exhausted and declining is clear without much evidence. This can also prove that our victory is approaching. According to various reports published by the [enemy] themselves before March of this year, the total number of casualties in their war of aggression in China in the past two years is more than one million people. This number of casualties is now cumulatively increasing. Although they have died so many people in these three months, they not only have not made any progress, but their so-called "mopping-up" operations in various places have encountered our more intense "counter-mopping-up" operations. The results of their self-proclaimed "April Offensive" and "May Offensive" are well understood by everyone. — This is only in terms of military affairs between the two sides. If we look beyond military affairs, the most important things are: In early spring this year, Konoe, whom they boasted was the only wartime cabinet, could not stand and collapsed. Economically, [they] are exhausted, unemployment is increasing, rural areas are more exhausted, prices are soaring, and gold reserves have been exhausted. In terms of morale, anti-war sentiment is becoming more and more widespread. Professors and intellectuals in universities, thousands and hundreds of them, are being denounced, imprisoned, and killed. Not only domestically, but even in the [enemy]'s troops in China, anti-war sentiment is brewing and anti-war actions are taking place everywhere. Diplomatically, they are becoming more and more isolated and dangerous day by day. They want to attach themselves to Germany [and Italy] to increase their power, but because their strength is weakening day by day, they are unreasonably making trouble with Britain, but they also want to use empty words of not joining the German-Italian alliance. They must also continue to provoke and intimidate to carry out their actions. We can assert that their past policies of threats and inducements in the international arena have obviously failed, and in the future, they will trend towards the greatest and final failure. The [enemy]'s current state of madness is intensifying day by day, which is a reflection of their suffering without a way out and their risky and opportunistic mentality. It is also because they know that the end of the road has come and there is no cure. They are drinking poison to quench their thirst, seeking temporary relief, and hastening their own demise. The [enemy] today is not only despised by the whole world, but the day when they will be punished by the whole world is not far away. (To be continued tomorrow)

### National Support for the Ministry of Finance's Measures. The British Government's Attitude Remains Unchanged: Emphasizing the Stability of Our Legal Tender.

[Chongqing, Tonghai News Agency, 6th] Yesterday, the local Chinese [newspapers] jointly published articles criticizing the new orders recently issued by the Ministry of Finance, saying that the Chinese people enthusiastically support them, saying that this is enough to give the Japanese a direct blow. Although China's national currency has been constantly [fluctuating], it is still as stable as ever. The publication also said that this move is enough to increase the production of domestic goods and the quantity of exported goods, so that a huge amount of trade surplus can be made up, and at the same time, it can consolidate China's finances. Although the promulgation of this [law] seems to be a little late, in any case, it is extremely popular with the people. Until now, the prices of various goods have not risen, which is enough to show that the people recognize the necessity of this step and cooperate with the government.

[Chongqing, Haitong News Agency, 6th] This morning, according to a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Finance, China has not issued any new regulations. The national business community is satisfied with the Ministry of Finance's policies and is prepared to assist the government within the scope of its capabilities. The Ministry of Finance originally controlled the export of 24 kinds of goods, but has now abandoned control of some of them, leaving only [tung] oil, pig [bristles], and minerals. The spokesman also said that if exporters suffer losses due to purchasing foreign exchange at government-stipulated prices, they can apply to the government for compensation. Finally, the spokesman said that the Ministry of Finance's instructions will not only have good results during the war but also in peacetime.

[London, Central News Agency, 5th] Labour MP Mr. Brown asked in the House of Commons yesterday about the value of Chinese legal tender. He asked whether the British government's policy was to consolidate the foreign exchange value of Chinese legal tender. Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon said that the government believed that, from the perspective of the economic and financial interests of Britain and the countries related to overseas Chinese, the stability of Chinese legal tender was extremely important. I have not seen any reason for the government to change this view. Mr. Brown continued, whether the government's view is the same as when the previous bill to consolidate the Chinese Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund was passed. In other words, whether the government intends to consolidate the foreign exchange value of Chinese legal tender, that is, to hope that its foreign exchange value will change slightly compared to when the government provided a guarantee. Whether the government still maintains its original intention. Mr. Simon said, I have already answered the questions raised by Mr. Brown. The government believes that the stability of Chinese legal tender is extremely important. As for what measures the government will take in the future, I do not intend to make any statement at this time. Mr. Brown then asked whether the government still intends to consolidate the foreign exchange value of Chinese legal tender and whether the Ministry of Finance has sufficient funds specifically for this purpose. Mr. Simon said that the measures mentioned by Mr. Brown have been stipulated by the government in legislation. As for what measures the government intends to continue to take, I am currently unable to announce it.

### [Enemy] Planes Attacked Chongqing Yesterday: Repelled by Our Anti-Aircraft Artillery. Foreign Church Hospital Bombed.

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 5th] More than 30 [enemy] planes, in four batches, raided Chongqing City at 1:00 AM on the 6th. When the [enemy] planes sneaked in in batches, because it was late at night and they were subjected to fire from our anti-aircraft artillery, the [enemy] planes indiscriminately dropped many bombs and incendiary bombs, and then fled back the way they came. According to subsequent investigations, although there were two fires, they were quickly extinguished by the fire brigade.

[Chongqing, Haitong News Agency, 6th] Last Wednesday night, twelve Japanese planes passed over Chongqing City and dropped bombs downstream. Before long, a second team of twelve planes rushed into the city's airspace and dropped a large number of heavy bombs. At 2:00 AM, a third group of three planes dropped incendiary bombs. There were two fires in the city. The air raid alarm was lifted at 2:50 AM.

[Chongqing, Haitong News Agency, 6th] According to unofficial reports, when Japanese planes carried out an air raid on Chongqing City last Wednesday night, the Canadian Church Hospital in the city was hit by two bombs. The extent of the damage is unknown. It is said that the hospital had evacuated patients earlier. Also, several heavy bombs landed near the former German consulate, causing serious property damage. There were also two fires in the city, but fortunately, they were quickly extinguished. There has been no official report on the losses from this air raid.

### The Ugly State of the Puppet Show: The Guangzhou Puppet Organization

[Guangzhou, Reuters, 6th] The puppet maintenance association here is now making extensive preparations to hold the second anniversary of the July 7th Incident and to call July 7th "Reconstruction Day." Tomorrow morning at 10:00 AM, a mass rally will be held here, and a parade will be held, passing through Dongdi to Dongzhi. It is reported that the Japanese authorities have prohibited the parade from being held on Sha Ji, which faces Sha Mian. The Japanese residents here will gather at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall tomorrow to commemorate the second anniversary of the July 7th Incident. Martial law was suddenly imposed here at 3:00 AM this morning, but it was lifted after only two hours. A Japanese spokesman said that this move was of no particular importance.

### A Message to the Japanese People: Do Not Be Deceived by the Warlords' Propaganda. You Should Join Hands With Us to Fight the Common Enemy.

On this day last year, I spoke to the Japanese people. The key words were: "China's War of Resistance is not only for self-defense and survival, but also to realize the future happiness of the people of China and Japan. Your country's violent military is not only the [enemy] of the Chinese people, but also the common [enemy] of the Japanese people." The military [faction] has continued to invade China for another year. How can I represent the nation's military and civilians and declare that we still hold this view towards the Japanese people? Moreover, we have a deeper understanding that the Japanese warlords are the common [enemy] of the Chinese people. Therefore, I think that on this second anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction, I should announce a few points in more detail to awaken the Japanese people:

(1) Exposing the deceptive propaganda of the Japanese warlords. Japanese people, in the two years of your warlords' invasion of China, especially in the past year, I deeply know that the Japanese people must be in great mental pain. Why? Your warlords originally claimed that they could defeat China in a few months, but in fact, it has been a few months, a year, and two years. Your burden is increasing day by day, and your domestic control economy is tightening every moment. General foreign relations are also becoming more complex and tense. You can't help but think in your hearts: What will be the result of this war? I think that any Japanese people with a little knowledge will at least think about these questions, but they will not get a suitable answer. I am the commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the Republic of China and the president of the Chinese Nationalist Party, so I can give you an answer to this big question. Below, I will talk to you in as much detail as possible in several sections, and I hope to achieve these two goals: First, to awaken you from deception and oppression; Second, to point out a sure and correct path for you. For this reason, I first expose the deceptive propaganda that your warlords have made to the public. Since the outbreak of the war, your warlords have probably been making the following kinds of propaganda:

First. Japan's invasion of China is because China has adopted resistance to Japan as its national policy, so it has no choice but to resort to war. Some propaganda even claims that the invasion is Japan's self-defense. These words are childish and absurd, and are not worth refuting. Let me simply state a few sentences. You try to think, is there any country in the world that specializes in viewing another country as its national policy?

It's a joke. China takes peace as its national policy, which has been the case since ancient times. The basic ideology of the Chinese people is peace. The essence of nationalism in the Three Principles of the People lies in upholding China's freedom and equality, but never infringing on the freedom and equality of other countries and peoples. This is our basic national policy. We respect the freedom and equality of any country and people in the world. Why should we single out the [nearby] Japan for hostility? This is absolutely unreasonable. But at the same time, you think about it; if there is a country that invades Japan with force, will you resist? You will definitely say, of course we will resist! Then the problem is clear. After your warlords invaded and occupied our Northeast Four Provinces, they launched an attack on Lugouqiao two years ago today, and then occupied our Peiping and Tianjin. We Chinese people are the same as you, people of flesh and blood. Moreover, China is such a great country with a rich culture and a long history. At the same time, it is a new country that is striving to complete the revolutionary construction of the Three Principles of the People. Can our government and people sit idly by and watch your warlords' military slaughter without resisting? If you think about it calmly, you cannot but admit that you are the aggressor and we are defending ourselves. Of course, the aggressor is the [enemy]. This does not need much explanation. As for saying that Japan is self-defense, it is even more ridiculous! Self-defense can only be said when a country's or people's survival is threatened by invasion. How can Japan say it is self-defense? China has never invaded Japan, and will never want to. But Japan is actually invading China on a large scale. If Japan says this is self-defense, then even as Tanaka Memorial said, conquering Asia [and the world] is nothing more than the exercise of the right of self-defense.

Second, your rulers constantly propagate that Japan has no territorial ambitions towards China, no hostility towards the Chinese people, and that they are willing to cooperate with China and do not harm China's independence. You think about it, if this propaganda is true, then you can ask your government, then why mobilize more than a million troops and spend nearly one trillion yen a year to wage such a large-scale war of aggression? This question will expose the truth. You think about it, if Japan has no ambitions, no hostility, does not harm China's independence, and is willing to cooperate with China, this is exactly what China is asking for. How can it not be happy to shake hands? Let me expose it to you! You must firmly remember one thing, your rulers, especially in the past few years, have been completely lying. What they say is completely contrary to the facts, just like the ideology of opposing expression in Rachi Ryogi's book. Saying there is no ambition is having ambition; saying there is no hostility is having hostility; saying they are willing to cooperate, in fact, they are unwilling to cooperate; saying they do not harm China's independence; is harming China's independence. Read your rulers' propaganda towards China from the opposite meaning, and you will never be deceived. Japanese people. I say this entirely based on facts, without any prejudice. Of course, according to your rulers' explanation, the so-called not harming China's independence may be true. Because they sincerely want to make the great Republic of China an independent country like the pseudo-state of Manchukuo. Speaking of the contents of the pseudo-state, you know at least as much as we do. You think calmly, the so-called emperor of the pseudo-state, and the power of its government, do they have the functions of the head of an independent state or government? In our Northeast Four Provinces, no matter who it is, do they now have the political and economic freedom that the people of an independent country must enjoy? In principle, people should tell the truth and not tell lies. If a large group of people are treated as slaves, they should not be said to have been given freedom. If a part of China's territory is forcibly occupied, it should not be said that an independent country has been established. Since today two years ago, your military, with its successful means and philosophy in Manchuria, is equally independent. You think about it, isn't this the greatest ambition, the greatest hostility, the most extreme non-cooperation?

Third. Your military also has a common propaganda, saying that China is going to be communist, and that fighting China is to prevent communism. This kind of [nonsense] has been promoted for many years and is already so stale that it is not worth laughing at. But in order to make you understand the facts, let me simply refute it: You think about it, for example, if China is indeed a country that practices communism, then so-called anti-communism, although there is no reason, is still not without a cause. Now China is clearly not a communist system country, but a country based on the Three Principles of the People. How can it be said that invading China is to oppose communism? Moreover, fundamentally speaking, a nation has the absolute right to self-determination in its internal affairs. This is what is called sovereignty. Therefore, the internal affairs of any country are not allowed to be interfered with by foreign countries. For example, we have never wanted to interfere in Japan's internal affairs. What system Japan is willing to implement is the freedom of the Japanese people. We have no intention of interfering and do not feel any pain. If Japan is anti-communist, it can take measures within its own country, but it must not interfere in China. Interference is to despise sovereignty. Moreover, China has no so-called communism. Since the Chinese Communist Party declared its support for the Three Principles of the People two years ago, in fact, the thoughts and actions of the Chinese people have been completely unified under the Three Principles of the People. The highest principle of Chinese national law is the Three Principles of the People. All actions that do not violate the Three Principles of the People are legal, and all people who take legal actions are equally protected by law. Today in China, all parties and factions are under the leadership of the Chinese Nationalist Party, obey the law, and are loyal to the War of Resistance. The fact is so. Therefore, your military's anti-communism propaganda, in addition to distorting the facts and despising China's sovereignty, has no reason whatsoever. To be honest, your military's "anti-communism" is completely a smokescreen. To invade China, you have to find a more pleasing reason to the Japanese society as a cover. What you have chosen is anti-communism. If you say it bluntly, it is not worth refuting. Our government in the past, in order to uphold the Three Principles of the People, to maintain national unity, and to prevent social division, (the code here is unclear) taking advantage of my danger, occupying the Northeast, threatening the police, (the code here is unclear) hindering the success of China's unification, and launching this two-year war of aggression, in short, it is anti-China, not anti-communism. If you hear your military's true intentions, it is precisely afraid that China will not be chaotic. What does it care about communism? Because the more internal chaos China has, the easier it will be for your military to realize its ambition to destroy China. What it is dissatisfied with is only because China's unity and solidarity are contrary to its hopes.

Fourth, there is one more point. Your military also said that Japan's purpose is only to overthrow the anti-Japanese Chinese government, and to cooperate with the pro-Japanese Chinese government. This is also extremely insulting to China and deceiving to most Japanese people. I can tell you clearly that China has only one National Government, and our National Government is supported by 400 million people and exercises the supreme power of the state. Your warlords want to overthrow our government, which is to fundamentally eliminate our country. The matter is clear and there is no doubt. The duty of our government is to safeguard sovereignty and implement national policies. Fundamentally, there is no such thing as anti-Japanese or pro-Japanese.

### Appeal to Allied Nations, Governments, and Peoples: We Are Determined to Strive for World Peace and Hope Allied Nations Will Share This Sacred Task

Today marks the second anniversary of China's resistance against Japan's military aggression. I wish to take this memorial date to express the collective feelings and expectations of our soldiers at the front lines and our people throughout the country, and to convey our earnest words to the governments and peoples of our allied nations!

The Japanese militarists originally sought to conquer the world by conquering China, making this their national policy. Concealing their wild ambitions, they began with the invasion of China, determined to satisfy their desires by conquering the world. Before the July 7th Incident, many in the world were still skeptical about this, but now it has become an undeniable fact. Moreover, the current state of lawlessness and anarchy in the international community was, in fact, initiated by Japan's forceful occupation of our Northeast Three Provinces in the September 18th Incident of 1931, a fact now universally recognized worldwide. Since the announcement of the "New Order in East Asia" by the Japanese Konoe Cabinet on December 22nd of last year, it has become even clearer that their invasion of China, regardless of the pretense, is actually aimed at eliminating the rights and interests of European and American countries in Asia and achieving their goal of dominating the Pacific Ocean. China, as the country directly invaded, should, of course, spare no sacrifice and fulfill its obligation to safeguard its independence and survival. We also firmly believe that the effectiveness of China's war of resistance against Japan lies not only in protecting China's independence and survival, and thwarting Japan's attempts to disrupt East Asia and exclude the rights and interests of our allied nations in the Far East, but also in having a significant impact on the future order of the world and the future welfare of all humanity. In light of this, although the Japanese militarists have exhausted their brutality and madness over the past two years, our entire military and civilian population has become increasingly aware of their ambition and increasingly determined to resist aggression. Going forward, our country will not consider the extent of sacrifices or the length of time required, but will continue to use military force to strike at the military aggression of the Japanese warlords in order to defend the independence of our nation and uphold all international agreements. Unless the aggressors thoroughly abandon their policy of aggression, our war of resistance will never be reconsidered or stopped, no matter what sacrifices and suffering it entails.

Since the end of the European War, our friends in various countries have made their greatest efforts for human peace. The crystallization of these efforts is the three major covenants known to the world today: the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty. Japan's military actions against China are destroying these covenants. What our country, from top to bottom, finds deeply gratifying today is that the allied nations that originally proposed and established these three treaties have not changed their enthusiasm and lofty aspirations for upholding the dignity of treaties and opposing wars of aggression. Although the Japanese warlords have recently repeatedly threatened various allied nations, vainly attempting to exclude the rights and interests of our allied nations in order to establish their so-called "New Order in East Asia" and adopting the cunning strategy of "divide and conquer," they have not only humiliated the overseas Chinese of various allied nations and plundered the property of various allied nations in China, but have also blindly bombed and harmed all religious, cultural, economic, and other undertakings of our allied nations in China and their service personnel. In fact, they have essentially provoked our allied nations and are willing to be seen as the head of an army. However, for the past two years, thanks to China's war and struggle, the enemy has been exhausted and has no remaining strength to oppress other countries. The threat of Japan is actually just a bluff, a mere empty threat. We firmly believe that the peace-loving and justice-upholding allied nations will not be deceived by Japan's boastful words or intimidated by its extremely evil and mad behavior, and will not underestimate their sacred responsibility under justice and treaties.

The sympathy and assistance that the governments and peoples of our allied nations have given to China's war of resistance in the past two years will be remembered and cherished by our entire military and civilian population forever! However, since China's war of resistance is not only fought for the fate of China itself, we today make a more unified request: that the allied nations invoke the authority of sacred international covenants and implement effective economic sanctions against Japan; that the governments and peoples of the allied nations also consider this to be justified and no longer delay its implementation. People in various allied nations all know that the money from the sale of Japanese goods and the petroleum, copper, iron, and other military raw materials purchased by Japan are sufficient to increase Japan's violence. The increase in this violence not only helps it slaughter innocent Chinese people but also endangers the public and private property and lives of various allied nations in China. If various allied nations can immediately implement effective economic sanctions and, at the same time, strengthen material assistance to China, then, with China's own strength and the power of world justice demonstrated by this international sanctions, the collapse of the Japanese militarists can be forced in a short period of time, the effectiveness of various international covenants can be restored, and the lasting peace of the world and the happiness of all mankind can be promoted.

Covenants and justice must be defended with strength. World peace is indivisible. Therefore, countries that love peace and justice should not only clearly distinguish between right and wrong, but also recognize their own interests. They must act righteously, establish trust, actively cooperate, build a common front, and act with a just attitude and resolute actions in order to be effective. If they remain hesitant or retreat in order to seek temporary self-preservation, they will be colluding with war and aggression, which is by no means the way to maintain world peace. China has also exercised extreme patience in seeking the path to peace, tolerating it for a long time before finally being forced to resort to war, because the ambition of the aggressor is limitless and their desires are boundless. The so-called "giving them whatever they want" will never be enough to satisfy their desires, no matter how far we retreat or to what extent we endure. We urge our allied friends to reflect on this lesson and be alert. At the beginning of the September 18th Incident in 1931, if the allied nations, signatories to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty, had taken resolute action, we dare say that there would not have been the raging fire of today, causing anxiety to the entire world. However, it is never too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. If the allied nations can rise up quickly today and jointly impose sanctions, it is not too late, but rather the right time. If they miss this opportunity, the future international war and the disasters of mankind will be unspeakable. The crimes of the aggressors are unforgivable, and our allied nations will not be able to escape their historical responsibility.

Finally, I would like to add one more word to our allied nations: China is a nation that has loved peace for five thousand years. In the future, we will make even greater efforts for world peace and justice and fulfill our due responsibilities. Knowing our national categories, we only uphold justice and trustworthiness, and we will never fear any military aggression or oppression. Today, our people are poor and exhausted, and what they expect from their allied nations is only to fulfill their responsibilities and obligations, and we do not harbor extravagant hopes or excessive demands. China and our allied nations are all members of the international community and of humanity. We must depend on each other, fulfill our respective responsibilities, and uphold justice to the end. I believe that China, with its 450 million people, will be able to make a great contribution to the order and prosperity of the world, and will never fail the assistance and further cooperation of our allied nations today. Whether today or in the future, not only does China need our allied nations, but our allied nations also need China. The Japanese invasion has already lasted two years, and its狂暴 attempts are becoming deeper and more obvious every day. Therefore, we hereby declare the purpose and determination of China's resistance to aggression, and deeply hope that our allied nations will fulfill their obligations in a timely manner and fulfill their sacred responsibilities in order to eradicate the aggressors' delusion of establishing a so-called "East Asian Order" and restore international order, ensuring lasting peace in the world. This is what the entire Chinese people hope for, and it is also the victory of human civilization!

Be Loyal to the Country, Be Filial to the Nation, Be Kind to Compatriots: Break the Selfish, Self-Interested, Capitulating, and Submissive Attempts

### In the Area South of Guangzhou, Our Troops Launch a Counteroffensive. A Military Conference Was Held in Shaoguan Yesterday. Peace and Tranquility in Lingdong, Chaozhou, Jieyang, and Chenghai.

[Special Dispatch from Shaoguan, This Newspaper, 6th] Chairman of Guangdong, Li Hanshun, went to Chongqing to report on his duties and listen to important matters. After staying for a month, he recently returned to Shaoguan. An important military conference was held here today, chaired by Li to discuss and resolve to strengthen the performing arts team and intensify the offensive against Guangzhou, Zengcheng, Jiangmen. The Guangzhou puppet regime is promoting "peace" and claiming that a fake organization will appear on this year's Double Tenth Festival. The Guangdong authorities' anti-Soviet tactics will serve as a wake-up call for these people.

[Reuter's, Chongqing, 6th] A Chinese military spokesman stated yesterday at a reception for journalists that the Chinese army has now launched a counteroffensive in the area south of Guangzhou, attacking Japanese positions in the Xinhui and Jiangmen areas. The Japanese army recently sent the 5th Division to China, but this is a replacement force, not reinforcements.

[Central News Agency, Zhaoqing, 5th] Our advancing troops, attacking Jiangmen and Xinhui, broke through the enemy lines and advanced to the north of Xinhui City. Another unit passed through Baishi (north gate of Jiangmen) and captured many enemy soldiers. At 12 o'clock that night, a sudden fire broke out at Xuyang Bridge (northwest of Jiangmen), and residents fled to Baishi, creating a chaotic situation.

[Central News Agency, Xingning, 4th] No trace of the enemy in Dahao, peace and tranquility in Chaoyang, Jieyang, and Chenghai.

### The Enemy at Nanlin Bridge Attempts to Break Out Unsuccessfully; the Enemy Forces on the Baibai Highway Suffer Damage.

[Central News Agency, Pingjiang, 5th] At around 10 a.m. on the 3rd, a unit of the enemy, approximately 200 strong, besieged at Nanlin Bridge, attempted to break out and fiercely attacked our positions. After our front-line troops and the attacking troops coordinated and counterattacked, a fierce battle ensued for about an hour. The enemy was unable to withstand the attack and retreated to the town area, dug deep trenches, built high walls, and no longer ventured out. We, with the authority of our mission, in addition to continuing to surround the enemy, also cleared the battlefield, discovering more than thirty enemy corpses. We seized fourteen rifles, one machine gun, and dozens of other spoils of war.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 4th] A large part of the enemy forces on the Baibai Highway concentrated in Quandian. One day, more than 700 enemy soldiers advanced south and engaged in a fierce battle with our forces in Nanniushi, Qinsu. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and is still engaged in battle. In addition, the enemy in Anze invaded Beiping Town (north of Anqi) on the 27th. After our strenuous counterattack, we recaptured the area on the 28th and then recaptured Daxiaonan (south of Beiping Town) on the 29th, killing more than 100 enemy soldiers. The remaining enemy soldiers fled to Anze in defeat.

(Central News Agency, Xi'an, 4th) The enemy forces near Gaoluo, starting from the 26th, were fiercely attacked by our two armies in Majiagou and Liulinli, resulting in the death of more than 500 enemy soldiers, with corpses strewn across the field. The enemy angrily fled towards Qixian and Wenxi. We are currently pursuing and attacking them.

### Debate in the British Parliament Regarding the Situation in Tianjin: The Deputy Foreign Secretary Declares Efforts to Protect Overseas Chinese; Japan Still Detains Tianjin-Qinhuangdao Customs Revenue.

[Reuter's, London, 5th] In the British House of Commons, Liberal Party member Mr. Dada asked about the incident on the 2nd of this month in Tianjin where a British national, Mr. Anderson, was stripped and searched by Japanese soldiers, and about the situation in Tianjin. Deputy Foreign Secretary Butler replied that he had reported on the Anderson incident on the 3rd of this month and had nothing further to report at this time. Since the 27th of last month, no other incidents have occurred at the blocked road crossings. However, since the 1st of this month, only a small amount of milk has been transported into the British concession for hospital use. The British Consul-General has made representations to the Japanese Consul-General. The situation in Tianjin remains the same as reported by Prime Minister Chamberlain on the 28th of last month. Mr. Mann asked whether the government would do everything possible before the Tokyo talks to ensure that British nationals in Tianjin were not subjected to Japanese humiliation and were able to obtain all the food they needed. Mr. 界次 replied that the government would do its utmost to achieve this goal. Subsequently, a member asked the British government to guarantee that it would not hand over the four Tianjin criminals until a voucher was presented. The Deputy Foreign Secretary replied that he had replied to this matter on the 3rd of this month and had nothing further to report at this time. Subsequently, Labour Party member Mr. Becker asked the government to bear in mind what kind of resentment it would cause in China, India, and the entire Far East if it did not make this guarantee. The Deputy Foreign Secretary replied that this was one of the issues in the Tokyo talks, and the issue of handover could not be discussed before the talks. Then, Labour Party member Mr. Peng asked whether the Lord Chancellor had referred to this matter on Tuesday evening and whether he was speaking on behalf of the government. The Deputy Foreign Secretary replied that he did not think so. Mr. Manda then asked the Deputy Foreign Secretary to guarantee that the Tokyo talks would be limited to the local incidents in Tianjin. The Deputy Foreign Secretary asked Mr. Mann to pay attention to Chamberlain's report, which stated that local incidents would be discussed. The Lord Chancellor's speech mentioned by Mr. Peng refers to the one delivered by the Lord Chancellor Moham at the Mayor's banquet for the judges. When Moham gave a toast, he said that under the British flag, everyone is treated equally by the law. To cite a most obvious example, "If the government of a powerful country thousands of miles away requests the transfer of certain foreign suspects within the former imperial zone, we believe that this kind of request is not legal and should not be carried out until true evidence is presented. We believe that this is the right way to handle things. From a legal point of view, the laws of our country should be more important than temporary expedients."

[Reuter's, London, 5th] At today's meeting of the British House of Commons, a member asked Deputy Foreign Secretary Butler to explain whether customs revenues in Tianjin and Qinhuangdao were still being detained, or whether the obligation to remit foreign exchange to support North China had been abolished. Butler replied that the Japanese authorities were still detaining these revenues, and that the Chief Customs Secretary Gu Yi was temporarily depositing the funds in the Zhengjin Bank. In addition, Colonial Minister MacDonald reported that the Sultan of Terengganu had contributed 50,000 yuan to the British Empire's defense expenses and the Sultan of Brunei had contributed 100,000 yuan, saying, "The British government has accepted these donations, and I would like to take this opportunity to express the government's deep satisfaction with the further practical cooperation between the rulers of the Malay states and the British Empire in strengthening the security of the British Empire."

### Do Not Forget the Front-Line Soldiers Fighting with Blood; Negotiations Between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union Are in Progress; The British Cabinet Discusses Countermeasures Against the Soviet Union; The Three-Nation Agreement Is Still Under Negotiation.

[Reuter's, Paris, 6th] The British Cabinet held meetings yesterday morning and last night. The main agenda was the Moscow talks. Paris News commentator Peter Li discussed the progress of the talks, saying, "Mr. Steed was asked to stay in Moscow and present a definitive answer to the Soviet side within 24 hours. If the British-Soviet talks break down, France will..."

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 5th] Officials have recently stated that there has been very good progress in overcoming the difficulties in the negotiations on the anti-aggression treaty between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and it is firmly believed that the three-nation treaty will be concluded in the shortest possible time.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 5th] Authoritative sources here have recently stated that the rumors circulating abroad that the anti-aggression treaty between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has been concluded and will be formally signed in the near future are generally credible. It is true that there has been progress in the negotiations between the two sides, but it is not known whether the defense issues of the Baltic countries have been resolved. According to well-informed sources, the reply recently submitted by Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov to the British and French representatives contains a counter-proposal that needs further discussion.

### To Help Countries Against Aggression and Rebuild Armaments, the British Government Plans to Launch a Credit Loan of 100 Million Pounds.

[Reuter's, London, 6th] According to political visitors, the British government is now planning to launch a credit loan of 100 million pounds to assist countries against aggression and countries in rebuilding their armaments. It is understood that Poland, Romania, Turkey, and Greece have all requested assistance. Decisions were also made at last night's British Cabinet meeting.

### Poland Has Decided on an Action Plan, But It Will Not Take Action Immediately, and Neither Will It Send a Note to Danzig Soon.

[Reuter's, Warsaw, 6th] A certain newspaper here published an authorized statement saying, "The Polish government has decided on a plan of action, but this does not mean that it will take action immediately. The government is currently planning to inform the people of this plan. Only one thing can be specifically pointed out, that is, the government has not yet sent a note to Danzig." This statement also mentioned that foreign warships will sail to Guinea and that reports from Poland and abroad about the Polish Finance Minister's loan in London were inaccurate.

### An Analysis of the Danzig Problem

— Translated by Zhang

Original author: Mr. Platrazu, former member of the French Cabinet

People all over the world are now watching the development of the situation in Danzig. Rumors that Hitler will take new actions are spreading everywhere. Germany's aggressive ambitions and the democratic countries' determination to resist may lead to actual war. The situation of outward expansion and internal tension continues to be maintained, and the fear of war among the European people exists every day and cannot be removed.

Whatever changes occur in Danzig, it is only a revision of the peace treaty. In fact, such revisions began immediately after the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, and have been increasing daily. From 1918 to the present, the victors of the last European War have forgotten the course and development of the war, and have divided and distrusted each other due to different interests. Therefore, they have unknowingly agreed to the destruction of the treaty one by one.

The victorious countries of the European War believed that they had created world peace, and finally established an international order based on the principles of peace and law. However, in fact, their attitudes and actions did not achieve the expected results. On the contrary, a new world war is about to sweep through again, which is the cruelest for literary humanity.

The 1919 treaty may be inappropriate and should be revised, or it may be a fair and reasonable treaty that should be strictly implemented and observed. This was certainly easy at the beginning, but as time went on and the environment changed, difficult problems have arisen one by one. If this treaty needs to be revised, it should be implemented quickly and without delay, to avoid further revisions after being threatened by force, because the revision of a treaty is often an encouragement for the use of force in the future.

I am not here to state the destruction of the peace treaty and the responsibilities that general politicians should bear. These politicians in leading positions in various countries have increased the instability of the international situation due to improper actions, and there is even the possibility of a new war. If we are speaking of an international massacre, we should know how to act in order to achieve more favorable results, whether now or in the future. This is extremely important.

The world's war and peace, just like other human problems, have their methods and management problems. The method problem is worth noting. Hitler loudly condemned Britain and France for implementing an "encirclement" policy, which is turning black and white upside down and distorting the facts. In fact, Britain and France are only opposing aggression. For twenty years, the sacred treaty has been repeatedly rejected and destroyed unilaterally. This is Germany's consistent method. The victors of the last European War could no longer tolerate it and formed a united front to resist new atrocities. This is also a method against aggression.

But can this method of resisting aggression work? Will the Treaty of Versailles no longer be destroyed? Can those who have been destroyed be restored? Can an international alliance be formed to guarantee collective security? Do all countries in the world understand that international life requires political cooperation in addition to economic ties? If a new international order is to be established, what will it look like? I raise these questions not to answer them one by one, but to remind people not to cause war with aims and without knowing the real cause and benefits of the war. If war can be avoided but is not avoided, destroying the lives and property of millions of people and shattering all good prospects, this is the real great sin in life.

Some countries, like individuals, have the instinct to control other countries. The difference in political systems is irrelevant. If a new world war breaks out, then the Germans will be in this whirlpool and will certainly fail. It is very likely that the German people will become communists. But no matter what the outcome of the war, the entire people will not be completely wiped out. Therefore, if the fundamental problem cannot be resolved, there is a danger of launching a war every so often. This considerable period of time, in the current situation, is twenty years.

Danzig will be the fundamental problem to solve disputes. The military strength of Britain and France is no longer comparable to that of the Munich Conference last year. Poland has also expanded its military strength. The European War is no longer something that Hitler can easily seize. The Danzig problem can be resolved through negotiations based on the principle of equality, in order to avoid a human massacre.

If the Danzig crisis continues to exist, then one day war will come. But democratic countries love peace. They will use strong military force to prevent the occurrence of aggression; at the same time, they will work harder to adjust the European situation and try to avoid war in order to maintain world peace.

Seventh Anniversary Memorial Essay

### China's Wartime Finance and the Interests of Friendly Nations in China

— Kong Xiangxi

China's sacred war of resistance has now lasted for two years. Those who, at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese war, predicted that China's finances would collapse along with its military are now utterly disappointed. Over two years of arduous resistance, China's finances have not only remained stable but also demonstrably possess the capacity to sustain a prolonged war. The complexity of China's wartime finance is universally acknowledged, but there are reasons why China's finances have been able to support a long war far beyond what foreign observers had predicted. This lies in the meticulous planning and active measures taken in the years before the war to strengthen its

financial foundations and economic institutions. These significant advancements have enabled the nation to implement various plans to overcome wartime financial difficulties and enhance the national economy to meet the demands of the war. Furthermore, the increasing national inclination toward political unity, coupled with a burgeoning patriotism and ardent support for the government's established national policies, has further strengthened the government's ability to manage the nation's wartime finances.

China's economic life, based on agriculture and a simple self-sufficient system, has suffered less damage in the war compared to Japan's highly industrialized organization. Moreover, China possesses a vast hinterland, abundant manpower, and rich resources. Its people are also exceptionally

capable of enduring hardship, enabling them to quickly recover and allowing the government to establish a solid foundation for resistance and national reconstruction, thereby upholding its policy of protracted warfare. More importantly, there is a widespread, spontaneous global expression of sympathy for China's righteous cause and a growing recognition that Japan's unjust and aggressive policies not only threaten China's freedom and independence but also jeopardize the economic interests and political security of third countries. This recognition is a crucial factor in stabilizing China's finances. The recent financial and economic assistance provided by the United States, France, Britain, Russia, and other countries, coupled with the closure of world financial markets to Japan, further demonstrates this trend. This can be seen as powerful evidence of China's promising financial prospects and international creditworthiness.

Maintaining foreign exchange is not only a crucial factor in the successful operation of China's wartime finances but also of paramount importance to foreign commercial interests. Like any other country, China inevitably faces various financial difficulties arising from war and must adjust its economic and trade conditions accordingly. Fortunately, the currency reform implemented in November 1935 laid a solid foundation for maintaining exchange rate stability to an admirable degree, and it has also been highly successful in resisting the Japanese and puppet governments' attempts to undermine China's finances. Since the start of the war, China's legal tender has consistently maintained its status throughout the war zones and the rear, partly because the general public prefers to use legal tender over the banknotes that Japan and its puppet governments seek to circulate, and also because China's legal tender has the ability to be freely converted into foreign currencies. What has been truly astonishing over the past two years is not only that

China's currency has calmly coped with the war and the significant pressure exerted by the enemy's attacks despite repeated setbacks, but also the demonstration of its capacity to inspire confidence in China's financial prospects among both Chinese and foreigners is beyond doubt. In this regard, the friendly assistance of Britain and the United States is particularly noteworthy. The United States, through its purchase of Chinese silver and the granting of a US$25 million credit line by the Export-Import Bank last December, and Britain, through export credit guarantees and the establishment of a £10 million stabilization fund jointly with Chinese banks, have provided material assistance that has enabled China's monetary policy to proceed smoothly and has been of great benefit to their economic interests in the Far East. Another notable feature of China's wartime finance is the government's policy of resolutely repaying debts, which is of utmost importance to friendly nations. At a time when debt repudiation and wholesale defaults frequently occur in international financial markets, China has still managed to consolidate a batch of debts accumulated by the former Beijing government over the years, demonstrating China's outstanding creditworthiness. Moreover, since the outbreak of the war, China has continued to pay off all its debts without interruption, demonstrating its determination to repay debts. Despite the urgent need for war funds and the difficulties caused by the war, the government still meticulously maintains its debts, demonstrating China's outstanding debt creditworthiness in domestic and foreign markets. The continued need to repay debts increases the difficulties for the government and the people, but because the government is determined to maintain its creditworthiness, it has no choice but to endure the pain and make repayments. Twenty-one days after the start of the war, China cleared more than 53 million in domestic and foreign debts. This is even more valuable due to

Japanese interference with customs and salt taxes (the main guarantees for Chinese debt) and its attempts to disrupt China's monetary economy. From July 1937 to December 1938, the government had to transfer 175 million yuan from other sources to repay the principal and interest of various debts guaranteed by customs duties due to the occupation of certain areas and the cessation of tax revenues. Furthermore, due to Japan's forceful occupation of transportation hubs in occupied areas and tax collection agencies, especially in Shandong and Shanxi provinces, China had to temporarily suspend payments on the "Crisp" and Anglo-French loans last September. Moreover, due to Japan's forceful seizure of customs revenue in the war zone, disregarding its initial wartime guarantee to continue to remit the tax revenue from the occupied customs offices to pay off the debts, China had no choice but to take appropriate countermeasures on January 15 of this year after repeated negotiations failed to yield results. From that date, the Ministry of Finance no longer allocated funds to repay bonds guaranteed by customs duties and ordered the Customs Service to open a special account at the Central Bank to deposit a portion of the funds for repaying long-term debts, the amount of which was proportionate to the revenue from areas not affected by Japan. For the same reasons, the government took similar measures for debts guaranteed by salt taxes on March 26. It is gratifying that financial markets have shown sympathy and understanding for these temporary measures, which were compelled by circumstances. Currently, the Chinese government is making every effort to continue repaying debts despite unprecedented wartime difficulties. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance announced on March 26 that the government has begun negotiations, aiming to reach a reasonable and practical solution that will enable China to continue repaying debts, and is eager to achieve a satisfactory outcome as soon as possible, so that the interests of Chinese creditors can be protected. While the front lines are making astonishing progress, large-scale economic development in the rear is also advancing rapidly. This should be welcomed by friendly nations. Developing agriculture, industry, commerce, and transportation to overcome wartime difficulties is not only an urgent need during wartime, but also leads to the development of new economies in China's vast northwest and southwest regions. This kind of significant progress, with the potential to rapidly transform everything that has not yet been developed, is of equal importance to both Chinese and foreigners. As China defends itself against a powerful enemy, it is simultaneously implementing a great plan of economic development. The government welcomes financial and technical assistance from friendly nations, in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of international joint development of China, which serves as the compass for China's current and future construction policies. China seeks foreign cooperation not only to maintain financial balance during the war but also to solve the larger problem of economic recovery after the war. I hope that the European and American powers, in particular, cannot ignore the undisguised illegal acts and international pillaging that Japan has engaged in during the current war in the Far East, which have created a real and serious threat, affecting the major political and economic interests of the powers. The powers should understand the great international significance of this move, because Japan's attempt is to realize its established policy of first conquering China as the first step towards realizing its ambition to dominate Asia, and then to dominate the Pacific Ocean, and ultimately to control the world. Regardless of the impact of this policy on world peace and democracy, if Japan succeeds in its current adventurous ambitions and manages to control China's vast manpower and natural resources, it will further strengthen its ability to dominate European and American rights in the Far East. Can foreign rights in China be guaranteed by Japan, a militarist country that is unjust and aggressive? Or will it be safer to be protected by a new China that is undergoing orderly progress due to the war, is peaceful and willing to cooperate with friendly nations, and loves to develop the common interests of the world and its people? During the past two years of war, Europe and the United States have witnessed their rights and interests in China being trampled on, ignored, and destroyed by the enemy without compensation. The answer to this question should not be difficult to find.

Firmly Believe that We Will Win the War

### Anglo-Japanese Negotiations Remain Uncertain, Japan Does Not Relax Blockade of Concessions, Anti-British Rally Held in Tokyo

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 5th] Tokyo dispatch: According to sources, Anglo-Japanese negotiations are limited to the Tianjin incident. This morning, the British Embassy told reporters that the Anglo-Japanese dispute could be resolved through negotiations and not by force. They said that the date of the negotiations has not been decided, as the Japanese military representative from Tianjin has to return to Japan by train.

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 5th] Tianjin dispatch: Sugiyama came to Tianjin from Peiping yesterday and returned to Peiping this morning. He told reporters that the traffic restrictions on the British concession in Tianjin would not be relaxed, regardless of whether there was progress in the Anglo-Japanese negotiations.

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 5th] Tokyo dispatch: An anti-British movement mass rally was held here recently. Nagai, the leader of the Minsei Party, spoke, saying that the main issue in the Tokyo negotiations was Britain's support for the Chinese government. Nagai denounced Britain's entire Far Eastern policy since the Opium War, and said that every Japanese must regard himself as an "unarmed soldier" and confront Britain until Britain abandons its current attitude towards East Asia. During the meeting, large banners were hung with slogans such as "Down with Britain's hypocritical policy," "Abolish foreign concessions that harbor East Asian bandits," and "Conclude a Japanese-German-Italian military alliance."

[Reuter's, Peiping, 6th] The Japanese-run newspapers in North China continue to carry out propaganda defaming Britain. Yesterday, a newspaper claimed that the British authorities are secretly instigating Chinese bandits to disturb the Japanese army's rear and supplying them with military equipment, etc. However, the newspaper did not explain how this was possible, as the concessions have already been blockaded. In addition, much of the Japanese propaganda is directed at the British Consul General in Tianjin. According to reports from British missionaries who have arrived here from Shanxi, it is very clear that the anti-British actions there are being directed by the Japanese, as at least three Japanese were seen participating when the bandits robbed the British church's property. Some missionaries have been directly intimidated, and anti-British slogans have been posted on churches and chapels. One document even advocated "taking the 1900 approach" to deal with Britain. (Note: 1900 refers to the Boxer Rebellion). According to reports, the Japanese have arrested a senior British P&O Line officer and detained him on the grounds that Mr. Winterbotham has committed "insulting acts." The British Consulate and the P&O Line were unaware of Winterbotham's arrest beforehand, and Mr. Winterbotham has not returned to the ship.

### International Briefs

[Reuter's, New York, 5th] For the US Independence Day holiday, the nation was off for four days. During these four days, a total of 612 people died in accidents (compared to 517 during last year's Independence Day holiday period), including 248 from car accidents, 26 from train accidents, 145 from drowning, 6 from plane crashes, and 30 from fatal shootings. In Haiti, a sudden flood occurred in the coastal area, with the number of drowned victims often between forty and fifty. At least one hundred houses were destroyed, and two other cities are completely isolated, having become a swamp.

[Reuter's, Tokyo, 6th] Soviet Charge d'Affaires in Japan, Mr. Smetanin, has now set off to return home. Domei News Agency claimed that his recall was believed to be for "political reasons."

Small Comments

### What About Today?

Today, July 7th, is the second anniversary of the "War of Resistance and National Reconstruction Day" as designated by the Central Government. In the motherland, the entire nation is holding enthusiastic commemorations to mark this national holiday with actions of steadfast unity and steadfast resistance. Internationally, our friendly nations Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union have also successively held China Week and various movements to aid China and sanction Japan, commemorating this great festival against the aggressor. How will we, the compatriots who are exiled and residing on Hong Kong Island, spend this day?

Various overseas Chinese organizations, newspapers, schools, and enthusiastic people from all walks of life are prepared to become more tense and active from today onwards, fulfilling our responsibilities as citizens. We must show the same respect to these enthusiastic, patriotic compatriots who are fighting for the nation and the people as we do to the soldiers on the front lines, because overcoming new difficulties and striving for victory after the war depends even more urgently on the entire population and overseas Chinese!

What experiences and lessons have we gained from the great two years? What new difficulties and crises have we encountered? How should we strive to win victory after the war? We hope that everyone will carefully study the Supreme Leader's instructions, and patiently and sincerely explain them to your compatriots around you, so that the day of final victory will be closer! The international and domestic situation is more optimistic! We must further enhance our self-esteem and self-confidence, and increase our vigilance against traitors and puppets, and become even more tense and serious!

### Conscience Test

The sacred war of resistance has already entered its full second year. Soldiers at the front lines are fighting heroically in bloody battles, risking their lives, while people in the rear are displaced, unyielding. But what about us overseas Chinese here? We don't want to be overly demanding, we only hope that everyone who is still a citizen of the motherland can take ten minutes at noon to reflect and test their conscience with the following questions.

1. Have I consistently believed in the belief that "we will win the war of resistance, and we will succeed in national reconstruction" without wavering for the past two years?

2. Have I absolutely obeyed the Supreme Leader, supported the united front, and participated in practical work that helps "resist the war and build the country" for the past two years?

3. Have I contributed money and effort as much as possible? 4. Do I always remember the interests of the country and the people ×××××××××××?

4. Have I consistently refrained from reading the propaganda and newspapers of the enemy and traitors, and disbelieved their false rumors?

### Weather Station

What day is today? I hope the compatriots in Hong Kong will always remember today, and always live a day like today. The Supreme Leader has published three documents, hoping that every compatriot, every friendly person, and even every enemy person will study them.

Contribute your strength, contribute your money

You must have seen it! The Webster's English Dictionary is truly a huge work! You might think that Mr. Webster, the author of this great dictionary, must be a bookworm buried in his desk; ha, you'd be wrong!

When Old Mr. Webster was in elementary school, he was extremely naughty, not only not working hard, but also terribly dirty. Being scolded by the female teacher had become commonplace.

One day, that female teacher came to check cleanliness again, and asked him to hold out his hand to look at. Little Wei quickly spat on his right palm, and desperately wiped it on his pants. Naturally, it was of no use. The female teacher thundered:

"Look, is there anything dirtier than your hand here? If you can find something worse than this hand, I won't punish you to stand in the corner."

Little Wei immediately pulled out his left hand from his trousers.

### Maritime Storms (26)

— By Captain Lawton, Translated by Yang Bi

Summary of Previous Chapters

In the autumn of 1914, Jack, the wireless operator, and Bill, the mechanic, of the Cox Shipping Company traveled to Europe on a German ship. Because England and Germany declared war, British warships were coming to intercept the ship. The ship fled wildly. With great difficulty, they escaped the tiger's mouth and returned to American territory. Jack and Bill went back to New York to see Cox. Cox then asked them to supervise Mr. Wilson's son on the ship "St. Patrick". On the ship, Jack refused to send a coded telegram for a man named Johnson. It turned out that the guy was the German spy named Lavicky...

Jack jumped up with a start, fire burning in his eyes.

"Listen here, Mister," he roared, "you can take all the money in Germany and give it to me, but I don't want it. Now, if you don't have anything else to say, I'm asking you to leave this cabin, lest I——"

The young man rubbed his hands together furiously, his eyes turning red. A very vicious look appeared on Mr. Johnson's face, but he decided to tolerate it.

"Don't be so foolish," he coaxed, "think for your own good, you are involved with Germany——"

"Are you going to say, you don't understand?" Jack interrupted.

"Yes, I have to say that I——"

"No need to say anything more," Jack said in uncontrollable anger, "Now, Mr. Johnson, or Mr. Lavicky, I must ask you to leave."

For a moment, Lavicky seemed to be suffocating, his face turning purple, his hands clenching and loosening, unsure of what to do, sweat breaking out on his pointed head.

"What do you mean?" he opened his mouth.

Jack leaned forward, looking at him aggressively.

"That's what I mean, professor, no matter how you have this dyed false beard, I recognize you. You thought you had disguised yourself, used a false name, now, how do you feel."

"You——you——" the man was so anxious that his words became blurred, unable to speak clearly.

"From now on, we will pass many British ships along the way, if you come to cause trouble again, I will reveal your true face. It's settled, go now."

Lavicky had nothing to say, heavy, stumbling, turned around and left the cabin, Bill Nanno, just happened to come in, and bumped into him. He glared hard, this was Jack's old companion.

"Get out of here, and don't slam the door!" Bill joked loudly.

"You, damn you————" Ravi was so angry that his throat was choked, and he couldn't find the words to finish the sentence for a moment, he just raised his fist and made a gesture towards the two young men.

"Alright," Lavicky left, Bill grumbled angrily, "Jack, it looks like you exploded a broad bean once."

"Isn't that right?" Jack smiled, "I'd rather that German friend be good for a while."

### Siamese Tennis Players to Come to Hong Kong for Competition, Expected to Arrive Late This Month or Early Next Month

The Hong Kong Lawn Tennis Association recently received a letter from the Siamese Lawn Tennis Association, stating that it would send a total of four male and female players to Hong Kong for competition at the end of this month or early next month. These four players are currently in Japan, and their itinerary includes Manila, Saigon, and Singapore.

China After the War of Resistance Against Japan: Soong Ching-ling

To answer the various questions recently raised to me by many American friends, I would like to say a few words today, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Republic of China's War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to inform all friends in the democratic world of the purpose of our current national resistance. Almost everyone knows that China was unprepared for the terrible attack of Japanese imperialism. The organization of the people and the unity of the nation were only developed as the war progressed. The brave Chinese people, especially the armed soldiers, held back the modern Japanese war machine along the coast for up to five months. After the fall of Peiping, Tientsin, Tsingtao, Shanghai, Nanking, and Hangchow, our soldiers were still able to concentrate their forces and prevent the Japanese army from joining forces in the north and south within four months. During this period, China won the victory of the Battle of Taierzhuang. In the following six months, although the front line grew longer, the Chinese army still fought the invaders in the middle of the Yangtze River, fighting against the superior naval and air forces. At the end of this period, Guangzhou fell and Wuhan was evacuated, because these cities were within range of Japanese naval fire, and China had no naval defense. From last December to the present—about nine months—Japan has not made any real progress on any front, except that it occupied Nanchang at the end of March. At present, China's counter-offensive has trapped the enemy in Nanchang, and China has also broken through the enemy's offensive in the northwest of Hankow and the south and west of Shanxi, achieving important victories. At the beginning of the war, China's casualties were several times higher than Japan's. Recent casualty records show a ratio of one to one. This phenomenon, as well as many other phenomena, indicates that Japan's fighting quality is declining, while China's fighting quality is increasing.

Perhaps no one understands the decline of Japan's military position better than the Japanese government itself. Japanese imperialists are trying to eliminate the Chinese army, which is no longer a mercenary force, but is increasingly forming a national military force. This hope has been shattered. It is now trying to plot against China with political conspiracies. What it hopes for will still be an illusion. For example, it wants to collude with traitors such as Wang Jingwei to sabotage our national united front. After failing to weaken China with the slogan of peace negotiations, which is equivalent to surrender, Japanese imperialists and their servants are using anti-communist slogans to carry out their malicious propaganda. This kind of madness cannot deceive anyone. Wang Jingwei was expelled from the Kuomintang in January of this year, and was declared wanted in June. After he and his gang of traitors are eliminated, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China will be able to cooperate more closely. Even the soldiers in various provinces, whom the enemy has always tried to lure away from the National Government, have also telegraphed to request that Wang Jingwei be arrested and brought to justice.

Many foreigners in China ask: What will happen after the war of resistance? How is China changing during the war of resistance? Will China return to its old semi-feudal state? Or will it inexplicably turn red? Neither of these will happen. From the very beginning sixteen years ago! The Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China recognized Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People as the common program of the nation. When the war of resistance began, the two parties resumed cooperation, and this common program was reaffirmed. In fact, the leaders of both parties are determined to maintain a national united front, and to promote this common program during and after the war of resistance. They will continue to unite after the war of resistance and work together for national construction, with the goal of establishing a Republic of the Three Principles of the People, a new era independent nation governed according to democratic principles and focusing on the people's livelihood.

What kind of republic will this be? Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated that the Republic of China should be a republic directly governed by representatives elected by the people. The county is an autonomous unit and an electoral district for electing representatives to participate in the National Assembly. This system can only grow on the basis of fully promoting the exercise of civil rights. The National Assembly should be the highest organ of power, and the central government produced by it is responsible for governing under mandate. The current system of provincial divisions will be thoroughly reformed, and the traditional division of local troops will be completely abolished. The surface area of the new provinces will be much larger, which will be more convenient for administration and will improve efficiency.

The organization of the National Army is purely based on the needs of national defense security. In order to fulfill international obligations, such as international collective security. We must naturally have the necessary military equipment. Retired soldiers will be given jobs under a comprehensive national construction program. We want to develop a complete national conscription system, and the implementation of the conscription system will be based on democratic principles. The united front of the national war of resistance, the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the military unification under the leadership of the chairman, and his leadership in the government all represent an important forward development in the process of central centralization. This process and the growing democratic system are the most basic prerequisites for our national revolution. It would be wrong to think that these are just "wartime tactics." War has accelerated the advancement of this trend, it is true, but it is itself part of the necessary historical process, which will continue to develop even after the victory of the war of resistance. The fact that it is currently growing so vigorously proves that our national revolutionary movement, without a national united front, without the cooperation of the two major parties, without the combination of the army and the anti-Japanese mass movement, and without resolutely resisting Japanese aggression, it would be impossible to win the final victory. The conditions that have evolved from previous struggles are the reason for our success to date. Further national unity and democratic improvement will strengthen this foundation that has already been laid for the new China of the future.

Free Talk: Commemorating "July 7th" and the Anti-Traitor Movement by Huang Sheng

The biggest task in commemorating "July 7th" this year is to eliminate traitors and scum, strengthen the power of resistance, and strive for the final victory.

First, the traitorous elements led by Wang Jingwei have accepted the orders of their masters and are actively preparing to organize a puppet government? Attempting to establish a regime in our occupied areas to deceive the people in the occupied areas, this shows the military failure of the enemy and is being remedied by political tactics, but this strategy will still fail. The Wang Kemin and Liang Hongzhi puppet regimes are useless and have already been proven. Wang Jingwei will certainly not be able to put on any good show. This is not in the personal reputation and ability department, but in the fundamental contradiction of the enemy's policy. The enemy wants to "appease" the occupied areas, and the purpose is of course to occupy the occupied areas; but if the occupied areas are to be destroyed, the occupied areas cannot be "appeased". The enemy is powerless to solve this fundamental contradiction. Therefore, the emergence of the Wang Jingwei puppet regime is in fact the more violent beginning of the enemy's exploitation of the occupied areas, and it is also the beginning of the people in the occupied areas more clearly recognizing the faces of the traitors. From this point of view, winning over the people in the occupied areas, uniting the people in the occupied areas, and our advantages are still on our side. In the occupied areas, there are our guerrillas, and there are our brave people who serve the country. The enemy's and traitors' conspiracies only facilitate our development of guerrilla warfare, and only urge us to step up military and political work in the enemy's rear in the occupied areas. We must strike at the traitors with practical actions, eliminate the traitors, and eliminate all traitorous attempts by the traitors.

Second, traitors and scum are not only active in the occupied areas, but also in our complete areas. They collude with evil elements in the village to obstruct all progressive reforms, reduce the power of resistance, and spread rumors to confuse the public, but this is their skill, so we must always guard against and eliminate the activities of traitors and step up political propaganda work among the people. Here we must first improve the people's lives. This slogan has been shouted for a long time, and there is also this provision in the National Reconstruction Program for the War of Resistance Against Japan. Improving the people's lives is originally an important task for exerting the power of the people and supporting the War of Resistance Against Japan. It is also the only way to eliminate the traitors' conspiracies and cut off the traitors' roots. Therefore, in today's world where traitors and scum are rampant, changing the people's lives should not only be a slogan, but should be implemented practically. Secondly, we must fan the flames of combat in every place, and make the combat atmosphere in every place tense and thick. We do not deny that in the second phase of the War of Resistance Against Japan, because large-scale battles were rarely seen and the enemy's offensive was weak, some places, especially our rear areas, relaxed a little on combat work. This should be corrected immediately! We know that a relaxed situation will give traitors and scum opportunities to move around and give them a place to hide. In the fiery combat atmosphere, traitors and scum have no use for their abilities, and it is easy to expose their true colors. Therefore, in order to eliminate traitors and mobilize the people to support the most difficult second stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan, taking advantage of the start of the third year of the War of Resistance Against Japan, there is a need to prescribe a dose of combat stimulant in every place.

Third, traitors and scum are not only active in the mainland, but also active in overseas places. In addition to publishing their own newspapers, they also buy up backward newspapers and backward writers to be their echoers and loudspeakers, spreading fabricated news and confusing the public. Then, attacking the traitors' remarks and eliminating the traitors' remarks, this responsibility falls on the shoulders of our cultural people. We must admit that our past anti-traitor work seems to have done a lot on the surface, but in reality the effect is not great. Our power can reach the general intellectuals, but it has not penetrated into the vast industrial and commercial masses. Instead, the poisonous things are taken by the general public to quench their hunger and thirst. This cannot but be our great mistake! We have already discussed the issue of winning over the reading public. Yes, if we can win over the reading public, our goal of attacking traitors and eliminating traitors' remarks can be achieved. At this time when Wang Jingwei's traitorous regime is about to emerge, our work in this area must be especially intensified! Recently, many friends have advocated popular literature and art. This new path for cultural work is worthy of attention. We must not only write our works on paper, but also speak them, sing them, and sing them, so that they can be close to the people and penetrate into the people, and be able to start from among the people - to develop strength and eliminate toxins - on the day when the third year of the War of Resistance Against Japan begins, may all metamorphic workers unite more closely and fight for eliminating traitors and scum and increasing the power of resistance!

Burning the Red Chain Snake (Part 2) by Mingzhi

—The Story of the Old Granny—

"Many have been bitten to death; even more have been bitten. They are truly hateful! But we have also killed quite a few of them, and we beat them whenever we see them," the old woman continued to speak eloquently. "We beat them whenever we see these fiery yellow things. Sometimes there are too many of them, and we don't have time to beat them, so we wait a while, wait for them to spread out a little before we beat them again. After killing them, we burn them with wheat husks and wheat straw, burning them without a trace, not even ashes remain. You know, if we don't burn them like this, their rotten bones are poisonous, and dogs will go crazy if they eat them..."

"I know this," I interjected, expressing my local understanding.

"Recently, I don't know why," she continued, "although this place doesn't produce red chain snakes, it often produces some white-spotted snakes and gray bald snakes. They are really annoying, and they, together with the foreign red chain snakes, make it impossible for people to live in peace. We have already killed many of these snakes too..."

They were about to continue talking when he saw the people in the barracks coming out, so he walked over to them. It seemed that someone whispered something to him, and then he shouted sternly:

"Old woman, come over here, there are more questions to ask you!"

The old granny knew what this was about, so she walked over without hurrying.

"Who else is there in your family?" the man asked, looking at his face after hearing the whispers from the people next to him, his expression very different from before.

"There are also my son and daughter-in-law," she answered quietly.

"Where did they go?" the man asked again after whispering to the people next to him.

"My son went to Qingzhen to thresh wheat; my daughter-in-law is at her mother's house."

"It seems that many people have lived in your house!"

"Yes. A few days ago, when the fields were busy, we hired a few more workers."

"Unreliable!"

She didn't answer, perhaps because she felt she had nothing to say.

Then they asked a few more questions, and she answered a few sentences that she could answer, and if she couldn't answer, she didn't say anything, letting him go.

After a few more whispers, "they" all stood up and prepared to leave.

"Old woman, be careful; if there is even one bandit here, everyone will be killed, and the houses will be burned down!"

This was the farewell message. The old granny ignored them! She just watched "them" leave the village without saying a word. When "they" had gone far and could not be seen, she shouted: "Aming, go fetch a bucket of water."

Soon after the fire was extinguished and the smoke cleared, Captain Wang Mingyuan led us down the mountain and back to our original place. Because we knew that "they" would return to Qingzhen on the same day after going to the countryside to make a detour, and would never turn back.

When Captain Wang saw the ashes on the field, he said, "It's a pity, some fuel was wasted."

"There's nothing to pity," the old granny said with a smile. "If there really were red chain snakes for me to burn, I would be willing to tear down the house to use as fuel!"

Under such an inquiry, the old granny told us about the conversation just now.

"Yes, this is simply a poisonous red chain snake, I didn't expect you to think of it!" We all laughed and said. "We don't need to use any other name for our work in the future, just call it 'snake beating'."

"You beat, I burn," the old granny said, sweeping the ashes with a bamboo broom, with a happy look on her face. "Those who beat, beat, those who burn, burn, if there is not enough fuel, I will use my old bones if I have to!"

We resumed the work of threshing wheat, and at the same time, we talked more about the work of "snake beating" in the future. (The End)

May Everyone Stand Firm by Lun Ting

After the storm, it has not yet passed, but its evil forces are increasing. During this period, if you are not careful, there is a danger of falling, or you may go astray and fall into a trap.

The reason why evil forces are evil forces is clear to even a three-foot-tall child. Unless they are insane, or eager for wealth and must live an excessive life, they will recognize the thief as their father, follow the evil forces, not only follow them, but also add fuel to the fire and increase their power. For this kind of self-indulgent people, we naturally still hope that they will reform and repent of their past mistakes, otherwise, may law and morality naturally come to sanction them.

Self-indulgent people are of course a minority, but we cannot deny that besides such a minority, there are still many people who are panicked and whose feet are shaking at this time when the evil forces are increasing. I do not hesitate to repeat the old saying and want to shout loudly, may everyone stand firm!

Most young people are full of energy. Unless they do not recognize things as true, once they recognize them, they will resolutely persevere to the end and never compromise. Now, they have all recognized what are evil forces, and they will never be subdued by them. In this way, in addition to praising them and encouraging them, I am completely relieved and will not say anything else.

I am a little worried about middle-aged people. They certainly recognize things as true, but they mostly bear the responsibility of family life. In the process of this difficult life, they have to struggle hard to find a way out. In order to find a way out, they cannot but embark on the road of drinking poison to quench their thirst. This is really dangerous, and I hope they will make a decision not to be fooled, and those who are about to be fooled will rein in their horses and turn back immediately!

The most difficult thing is for the elderly. Some have been unsuccessful in their lives and want to take this opportunity to vent their anger; some have forgotten the ancient訓 of "be wary of getting what you want" and want to fill their desires. Of course, in addition, there are also those who have no choice but to do so because of the pressure of life. I want to say to them, this is a dead end. Not only will you not be able to vent your anger, but you will also leave behind a legacy of thousands of years. You will never get rich, and what you gain through evil means will definitely be lost through evil means!

The evil forces of the storm are desperately attacking us, and we can only stand firm and desperately resist. If we cannot win for a short time, we will eventually win the final victory; if one or two individuals die trying their best, we will eventually save most people who stand firm and live. We don't have to worry, just stand firm!

It seems that new blows are coming one after another, and some expected pressure may indeed appear. If we want to be human, to be someone who can stand tall and have nothing to be ashamed of, we must stand firm, not surrender, and not compromise!

Hurry Up by Xu Qing

"Old Ling! Cheer up! There will be a village after we cross this mountain ridge."

Two hairy arms supported me. I was dizzy, sweating, and the sweat was cold. I was trembling, even though it was a hot summer.

White clouds were hiding in the corner of the western sky, and the wilderness was silent.

Climbing a low slope, crossing a mountain ridge, there was no sign of human habitation, not a drop of water.

"Old Liu! I'm going to die!" I gasped, like a wounded stray dog.

"Ling! Don't worry, look at the shimmering water over there. Where there is water, there will be people!"

I opened my half-dazed eyes and looked over. There were verdant mountain peaks lined up, and a clear stream like mercury sparkled under the scorching sun.

"Then, we have hope!" I smiled, and my spirits lifted, although this was just a vague hope.

Old Liu has been my comrade in adversity for two years. He is a head taller than me, and his shoulders and wasp waist are almost in a triangle. His whole body is purplish-black skin, and inside it is a pure white soul. He can carry a wounded friend for dozens of miles, endure hunger and give a hard piece of food to others, while he pretends to be very quiet and says, "No! I have enough!"

This mission requires us to travel a long distance, and the road is deserted. When I open my eyes, there is only Old Liu and me. Under the scorching sun, under the guidance of the Big Dipper, we walked and walked, and our feet blistered countless times.

"Old Liu! I'm so dizzy!" Finally, I fainted on the slope.

Water splashed on my chest and forehead, and I woke up again.

Then I drank a lot of water, drinking all of my water, and all of Old Liu's water.

"Old Ling! Cheer up! There will be a village after we cross this mountain ridge!"

I was dizzy, sweating, and the sweat was cold again.

The sun hung on the corner of the mountain, and the road was covered with a layer of gloom. In the twilight, a group of salt vendors walked down the mountain slope.

"Hey! Fellow countrymen; excuse me! Is there an inn?"

The leading man pointed and said:

"Isn't that Yaoji Village over there?"

"Great! Hope is finally realized!"

Evening smoke rose from behind the hill, reaching out towards the motherland.

Reaching Out to the Motherland by Jin Yi

—Another Story of a Girl—

Qingfen listened to him, and at this time, she also felt a person wriggling beside her, and turned over.

At this time, the voices had already quieted down, the clattering of the machines sounded, and the anti-aircraft guns were also firing loudly. Three or five enemy planes skimmed across her eyes, and snow-white fireworks bloomed around them; but they could not, as she had hoped, make those murderous fellows fall from the sky.

Gradually, the sound of the planes became louder and louder. She looked carefully and immediately found that there were five or six planes hovering over her head. Suddenly, a very sharp sound of piercing through the air, she clearly saw a plane falling downwards. When it reached a considerable height, it dropped a bomb, and in the sound of the wind sweeping away fallen leaves, there was a sound that would shake people's eardrums.

The ground trembled, her body seemed to jump up and fall flat again, and then dense machine guns rang out.

A cloud of smoke rose into the sky, and she thought that someone must have died, but she did not shout, he did not groan. Then the second bomb fell, and her body was covered with upturned mud.

She did not remember whether she was dead or still alive, and her tense nerves felt sore in the two joints under her neck. But her heart was very calm, and she felt that facing death was unexpectedly easy. The place where the bomb fell was near her, and she would often think that maybe she would be hit by it sooner or later.

At this time, she felt a woman wriggling her body, and a hand stretched out, tightly grabbing her clothes. She almost screamed in terror, but that very familiar voice had already said: (To be continued)

Local News: Hong Kong Compatriots to Hold Anti-Japanese War of Resistance and National Reconstruction Second Anniversary Commemoration Today

Two years ago today, in order to realize its aggressive ambitions, the enemy launched an attack on us. Our great Chinese nation, in order to win independence and freedom, and to protect world peace, rose up heroically and resisted the aggressors. With a single shot at Lugouqiao, the entire nation's war of resistance was launched. It has been two years since then. During these two years, with our courageous spirit and great strength, we have shattered the enemy's aggressive intentions.

The compatriots all over the country are guarding this order very quickly and deeply, but what is the situation of the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong? We are willing to take this opportunity to make an interesting liquidation of these luxury goods on the occasion of the second anniversary of the "July 7" War of Resistance Against Japan and National Reconstruction.

### Military Affairs During the Two Years of Resistance

— Chen Cheng

— In Commemoration of the Second Anniversary of the War of Resistance —

I. Introduction

The Lugou Bridge Incident of July 7th two years ago sparked an unprecedented war of resistance against the brutal Japanese aggressors. We fight to resist aggression and protect the survival of our Chinese nation; we also fight to safeguard world peace and uphold human justice. The war has spread to almost the entire country. It has been two years since the start of the war, and the brutal acts of the Japanese invaders and the heroic resistance of our army are evident and have been witnessed by the world. Last year, this publication discussed the first year of the war in "Military Affairs During the First Year of Resistance," and reported the progress to the people of the country as a warning and encouragement. Now, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, I will summarize the progress of the war in the past two years, so that the Chinese people and the people of friendly countries will know that the Japanese are becoming weaker as they fight, while we are becoming stronger as we fight. And I hope that the people of our country will become more invigorated and move towards the path of victory together, to complete the great task of resistance and national reconstruction.

II. The Outbreak of War

In order to implement their traditional continental policy (as recorded in the Tanaka Memorial, first occupy Manchuria and Mongolia, and then attempt to invade all of China, and even monopolize Asia and conquer the world), the Japanese aggressors, after occupying the four northeastern provinces, constantly resorted to threats and enticements, attempting to control North China as a base for implementing their continental policy. However, they were repeatedly and sternly rejected by us, and they ultimately failed to achieve their goals. On July 7th, 1937, a detachment of the Kawabe Brigade of the Japanese North China Garrison conducted night exercises near Lugou Bridge, and under the pretext of searching for a missing soldier, attacked Wanping City. At that time, the Jixingwen Regiment of our 29th Army, with the responsibility of defending the territory, refused to comply, thus triggering the conflict, which is the so-called Lugou Bridge Incident. After the incident, the Japanese invaders successively increased their troops from the four eastern provinces and their own country into Shanhaiguan, openly attacking our Tianjin and Beiping. Having suffered from the Japanese aggressors' schemes for decades, we could no longer tolerate it. At the same time, the entire country, from top to bottom, held the determination not to seek temporary safety at the expense of national integrity and to fight to the death, vowing to use the human and material resources of the entire country to fight a decisive battle with the Japanese invaders, to seek independence for the country and strive for survival for the people, and to maintain peace and justice for all mankind. The war thus began. This is the course of its outbreak.

III. A Review of the War Achievements Over the Past Two Years

(1) The Battles of Beiping, Tianjin, and Nankou

In late July 1937, no fewer than 100,000 Japanese troops entered Shanhaiguan, attacking Beiping and Tianjin in four routes. After fierce resistance from our army, Beiping and Tianjin fell one after another due to the disparity in numbers and the unfavorable terrain. Judging from the terrain and the equipment of our army at the time, it was unrealistic to defend Beiping and Tianjin. After the Japanese occupied Beiping and Tianjin, in order to remove the threat to their flanks, they temporarily adopted a defensive posture on the Pinghan and Jinpu lines, and shifted their main force to attack the PingSui line, where a fierce battle occurred at Nankou. After inflicting heavy blows on the enemy, we were forced to abandon Nankou on August 25th due to the overwhelming disparity in numbers.

(2) Battles on the Northern Sections of the Pinghan and Jinpu Lines

After the Japanese occupied Nankou, they shifted their forces to attack southward along the Pinghan and Jinpu lines. Considering the flat terrain of the northern sections of the Pinghan and Jinpu lines, we avoided decisive battles to preserve our strength and engaged in a sustained war according to our predetermined strategy. Successive resistance was carried out at Zhuoxian, Baoding, Zhengding, Shijiazhuang, Anyang, Yangyi, Jixian and Xinxiang on the Pinghan Line, and at Machang, Yaoguantun, Cangzhou, Botouzhen, Meizhou and Douhai River on the Jinpu Line, and then withdrew to the south bank of the Yellow River, spending two months in total. Thereafter, a stalemate ensued.

(3) Operations in Shanxi

Since the successive occupation of Zhangjiakou and other places from Nankou, in addition to the southward attack along the Pinghan and Jinpu lines, the Japanese also advanced towards Huailai and Zhuolu, attacking northern Shanxi and occupying Datong. In late September, the Japanese sent their main force from Laiyuan and Lingqiu to launch a fierce attack on our Pingxingguan, and a part of their force broke through from Guzhikou, attempting to occupy Fanshi. After fierce fighting, we transferred to Wutaishan and Daixian to continue our resistance. In early October, the main force of the Japanese army, about 50,000 men, advanced towards Xinkou and Yuanping, attempting to directly attack Taiyuan. A battle took place near Xinkou, where we inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese and achieved an unprecedented victory. Later, after the Japanese troops on the Pingjin Line occupied Shijiazhuang, most of them turned to the Zhengtai Line to coordinate with the Japanese army's invasion. On October 26, Niangziguan was breached by the Japanese, affecting the favorable situation in northern Shanxi, and we had to combine the troops in northern and eastern Shanxi to directly defend Taiyuan. After successive resistance and inflicting considerable losses on the enemy, we abandoned Taiyuan on November 9 and moved to the mountainous areas of western and southern Shanxi, launching large-scale guerrilla warfare that still leaves the Japanese in a dilemma.

(4) Operations in the Shanghai and Nanjing Area

On August 13th, 1937, the Japanese initiated hostilities in Shanghai under the pretext of the "Hongqiao Incident." In order to maintain the economic center of Shanghai and the interests of various friendly nations, we resolved to counterattack the aggressors. We engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese on the line of the North Railway Station, Liuhang, Baoshan and Yuepu for three months. Through strong resistance, we inflicted great blows on the Japanese, thus establishing the belief in sustained resistance and winning international approval. Later, as the Japanese frontal attack was deadlocked and their casualties were heavy, they landed a part of their forces from Jinshanwei. Due to strategic considerations, we could not focus solely on Shanghai, so we gradually shifted westward and resisted step by step, all the way to Nanjing. At this time, since our capital had already moved westward, Nanjing no longer had the necessity to be defended from a military and economic perspective. After inflicting considerable damage on the Japanese, we abandoned Nanjing on December 13 and made an orderly retreat, leaving the Japanese with nothing. The Japanese then transferred a part of their troops to Hangzhou. It is estimated that the battles in the past few months had attracted 300,000 Japanese troops, and the Japanese suffered over 200,000 casualties, which was beyond the expectations of the Japanese.

(5) Battle of Southern Shandong

After seizing Tai'erzhuang and Nanjing, the Japanese wanted to open the Jinpu Railway from both the northern and southern sections, cutting off Shanghai. However, their attempt was detected by us, and we repeatedly inflicted severe blows on the invading Japanese from both the northern and southern sections. Later, the Japanese occupied the counties of Daixian and Tengxian in the northern section, and approached Taierzhuang. The situation was critical. In order to take advantage of the Japanese's sudden advance, we concentrated our forces to launch a fierce attack, resulting in the Taierzhuang annihilation battle. It is estimated that 30,000 Japanese soldiers were annihilated, and the remnants fled to Tengxian, where they stubbornly resisted. After this disastrous defeat, the Japanese transferred forces from various battlefields to the northern and southern sections of the Jinpu Railway, attempting to encircle Xuzhou from western Shandong to save their declining momentum and to avenge the shame of the so-called "Imperial Army's" defeat. However, we had already detected the Japanese's scheme. Adhering to our established policy, we abandoned Xuzhou on May 19 and transferred to southern Henan. The Japanese encirclement plan failed. At the same time, the 14th Division of the Japanese Army, led by Toihara, was attacked by us near Lanfeng, and many were annihilated. Later, as the Japanese troops advancing westward along the Lanfeng-Haifeng Road had reached Qixian, Guide, and Kaifeng, and the Yellow River levee had also been bombed, our attacking forces felt threatened on their flanks and backs, so they abandoned the attack and transferred to western Henan on June 2, adopting a defensive posture. The Japanese also stopped their westward invasion and shifted their forces to the Yangtze River area, waiting for an opportunity to attack Wuhan.

(6) Battle of Wuhan

After occupying Xuzhou, the Japanese actively prepared to attack Wuhan, attempting to annihilate our main force, force us to surrender, and achieve their goal of a quick victory. On June 12, the Japanese naval and air forces began to attack Anqing from the Yangtze River, advancing westward along the river. They also drove their main forces from both the north and south banks, advancing westward to encircle Wuhan. We took advantage of the favorable terrain, relying on the Dabie Mountains in the north and the mountains of Hubei and Jiangxi in the south, to resist step by step, gradually depleting the enemy's strength. The fierce battle lasted for four months, and many Japanese soldiers were killed. The defeats of the Japanese at Guangji in Jiangbei and at Wanjialing and near Wuning in Jiangxi echoed the victory at Taierzhuang. After suffering heavy losses, the Japanese occupied Guangzhou on October 21 to remotely support their Wuhan operations. The significance of our defense of Wuhan lies in delaying the advance of the Japanese army, depleting their strength, and covering the construction of our western and southwestern regions, as well as the transfer of weapons, materials, and industries. After months of fierce fighting, the number of Japanese personnel depleted by us in the outer defenses of Wuhan reached the expected goal, and all preparations had been completed. The Wuhan core area no longer needed to be defended, so we resolved to abandon Wuhan. On October 25, we carried out an orderly retreat for the sake of a long-term plan. However, the Dabie Mountains and the Mufu Mountains and Jiugong Mountains in the border areas of Hubei and Jiangxi were still in our control, establishing extensive guerrilla bases. The Japanese only clung to the strongholds, barely maintaining their existence.

The above battles belong to the first phase of the War of Resistance. According to the result of sixteen months of resistance, the number of Japanese army consumed reached 700,000 (number of Japanese casualties), and its delusion of "not fighting and surrendering" and "quick victory" was shattered by us. This is our harvest in the first phase of the war of resistance, and strategically speaking, it can be said to have achieved absolute success.

(7) Operations in the Current Phase (Second Phase)

After our army's withdrawal from Wuhan, the military affairs of the War of Resistance entered the second phase, that is, the stage of turning defense into offense and turning defeat into victory. However, after the Japanese occupied Wuhan, they not only gained nothing, but their difficulties increased day by day. The Japanese initially disregarded everything and drained the pond to catch the fish, repeatedly increasing their troops, originally seeking a quick victory. But although they achieved the goal of capturing Wuhan, they still failed to resolve the war. Because the war zone was too large, their forces were increasingly dispersed and exhausted, weakening their combat power. Moreover, they were restrained by us everywhere, and they were exhausted by running back and forth to provide support. In fact, the areas they occupied were only some urban strongholds on the transportation lines. However, they were constantly attacked by us, and they were unable to take a step beyond the fortified towns. The vast countryside still completely belonged to us, and all administrative powers were still exercised as before. The Japanese, seeing the failure of the war, the collapse of the domestic economy, and the exhaustion of military resources, were unable to increase their troops, so they occupied Hainan Island on February 10 this year, attempting to form a Far East base to threaten Singapore, Vietnam, and Britain and France, in retaliation for the sympathy and assistance of various friendly nations to our War of Resistance. However, the result was still a failure, which further aroused criticism within their own country, causing their own people to become increasingly bored and pessimistic about the war. In order to further cover up and shift the attention of their own people, the Japanese successively occupied Zhongxiang in western Hubei and Nanchang in February, only to increase their own tragic sacrifices, with no way to progress. On the other hand, our army's strength is increasing day by day. In April, all war zones launched large-scale counterattacks, successively inflicting heavy blows on the Japanese in Kaifeng, Anqing, southern Shanxi, Nanchang, and along the Jinghu Line. In early May, in order to defend against the counterattack of our army in western Hubei, the Japanese deployed three divisions of troops in the Yingcheng and Zhongxiang area, attempting to make trouble. As a result, they were again lured into the mountains between Dahong and Tongbai, causing huge damage to them and creating the victory of our Suizao Campaign. The Japanese then retreated toward central Hubei, admitting defeat. Recently, in order to threaten international actions, the Japanese landed in Shantou on June 21, but were still fiercely attacked by us. This kind of action by the Japanese only further disperses their forces and increases their painful burden, so the situation of the War of Resistance in the future will be more and more favorable to us.

IV. Conclusion

The Japanese have long harbored the intention to destroy our China. At first, they tried their best to undermine the unity of our country, sow discord, and use the policy of "using Chinese to control Chinese", and various threats and tricks, in an attempt to subjugate our country without fighting. However, in recent years, the unity of our whole country has become increasingly consolidated, and the preparation for national defense has also been improving. The Japanese, seeing that there was no way to implement their scheme, provoked incidents in various ways and forced us to start a war, attempting a quick victory. They once made the arrogant statement that three divisions could resolve the China problem in a week. However, since the start of the war, they have been met with our heroic resistance and fierce attacks. Yet, they still thought that 15 divisions could end the war within three months. Little did they know that the corner of Shanghai alone made the Japanese increase to twelve divisions and spend three months of hard fighting. Now the war has been going on for two years, and the Japanese have used more than 30 divisions, with casualties of more than 800,000. Their arrogance and wild words are really a laughing stock for the world. The current state of the Japanese is not only unable to resolve the war for a long time, but also trapped in a quagmire and falling into a dead end. Therefore, they do not hesitate to use various base means, attempting to seduce us to surrender halfway, and issued the so-called Konoe's absurd statement, raving about the so-called "New Order in East Asia." After our leader refuted them with strict correctness, and responded to their sinister schemes with repeated counterattacks, the Japanese then followed us in advocating a long-term war, "sustaining the war with war," repeatedly contradicting themselves, outwardly strong but inwardly weak, which is enough to see a glimpse of their failure and their situation of exhaustion.

In recent months, due to the fact that the military affairs in all directions have been unable to progress, and the situation has become unsustainable, they have become increasingly tyrannical, carrying out indiscriminate bombings of our undefended towns and rear cities, committing inhumane atrocities. These actions are enough to greatly increase the hatred of our entire nation for the Japanese and strengthen our determination to resist. Moreover, our entire nation's war of resistance is not limited to a few cities. The behavior of the Japanese in bombing cities is really not enough to weaken our strength in the War of Resistance in the slightest.

In short, the result of our two years of War of Resistance is that the first phase has already achieved our strategic goal of protracted attrition, giving the aggressors a painful lesson. The second phase (that is, the current phase) has already cultivated the strength to turn from defense to offense and demonstrated the fact of turning defeat into victory. And from the comparison of the combat skills, morale, and popular sentiment of the Japanese and us in the past two years, it can be proved that the Japanese are becoming weaker as they fight, and we are becoming stronger as we fight. Japanese officers and soldiers often surrender to us, hating the tyranny of their military and being ignorant of the future of the war. Therefore, we only need to adhere to our consistent policy and continue to resist to the end, and the Japanese will surely lead themselves to collapse, and the final victory will ultimately belong to us.
