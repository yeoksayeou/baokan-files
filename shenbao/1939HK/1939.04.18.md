### The Great Significance of President Roosevelt's Peace Plan

President Roosevelt of the United States, who has repeatedly condemned global aggressors and advocated for collective sanctions, once again adopted an extremely courageous and sincere attitude on the 15th, sending a telegram to Hitler and Mussolini, proposing a peace plan. Its content roughly includes three key points: first, exposing that aggressors repeatedly advocate for peace while in fact repeatedly annexing other people's countries; second, clarifying that the attitude and intention of the United States lies in compassion for the world's humanity, rather than weakness, timidity, or fear of war; third, specifically proposing a joint guarantee of the security of 31 countries worldwide. In today's era when the aggressive nations of Germany, Italy, and Japan are strengthening their policies of gradual encroachment and annexation, President Roosevelt's peace plan carries extremely significant meaning.

Recently, due to the escalating actions of Germany and Italy, Britain and France have also become more proactive in convening an anti-aggression coalition. Judging from the general situation, the formation of a global anti-aggression alliance is gradually becoming concrete. Not only have the small countries of Eastern Europe gradually come under the leadership of Britain and France, but military cooperation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has also shown a positive trend. Britain is eager for the Soviet Union to participate in the "Anti-Hitler Alliance," preparing to establish an air defense agreement with the Soviet Union, and France is also negotiating a new agreement with the Soviet Union to enable the Soviet Union to provide automatic assistance. At this time, the attitude and policies of the United States play a very significant role in the organization of this anti-aggression alliance. The trend of events may lead to the European anti-Hitler movement concretely transforming into a global anti-aggression front.

Why do we say this? Isn't President Roosevelt's proposal a plan for global peace? President Roosevelt's peace plan will absolutely not gain the approval of Hitler, Mussolini, or even the aggressor Japan in the East. Although Hitler, Mussolini, and others are still studying it carefully after President Roosevelt's peace plan was issued, German and Italian newspapers have almost unanimously criticized it maliciously. A Berlin dispatch on the 17th even stated: "Hitler, after discussing with Ribbentrop and Mussolini, immediately decided to reject President Roosevelt's proposal." The German side has further expanded the propaganda of the so-called "London terror against Germans."

The likely effect of President Roosevelt's peace plan is to more concretely and rapidly facilitate the successful conclusion of an anti-aggression alliance among peaceful nations. The greatest reaction to the peace plan is the response from the countries most actively opposed to aggression. Soviet newspapers unanimously and enthusiastically welcomed the peace plan. Political circles regarded President Roosevelt's proposal as a practical and effective step in maintaining world peace. The Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee, Kalinin, even sent a special telegram to President Roosevelt expressing his congratulations. Secondly, public opinion and political circles in anti-aggression countries such as Britain and France also welcomed President Roosevelt's proposal with extremely excited attitudes and tones.

This peace plan of President Roosevelt targets aggressors, including those in the East, making the anti-aggression alliance global, rather than limited to Europe. The peace proposal mentioned that the Japanese aggressors' occupation of China was an oversight. We hope that the United States, which plays a pivotal role in maintaining peace in the Pacific, will have another opportunity to reiterate this point. At the same time, the conclusion of the future global anti-aggression alliance must include the East, making it a complete "system of collective security." Currently, the actions of the aggressive countries have very clearly become closely linked, and they echo each other in the East and West. Regardless of whether some within the Eastern aggressor themselves do not approve of hastily joining the military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, the collusion and conspiracy of the three aggressive countries are undeniable facts.

China has recently launched large-scale counter-offensives on various battlefields in the North and South and has been winning victories steadily. This should have extremely significant meaning for the concrete formation of a global anti-aggression front that includes the East. Any proposal for a global anti-aggression plan should not forget that China is one of its pillars.

### China's Economic Diplomacy During Wartime

— Zhang Xiaomei

Dr. Zhang Xiaomei is a well-known economist both in China and abroad. He has served as the director of the Economic Research Office of the Bank of China and has also presided over the National Institute of National Economy of China. It is said that Dr. Zhang has also been appointed as the Deputy Director of the National Southwestern Economic Research Institute, which is currently being prepared for establishment.

(1) The Key to Success or Failure in Modern Warfare

During the World War in 1914, Germany stood alone against all sides, fighting for four years, and ultimately failed: not because of setbacks on the front lines, but because of the inadequacy of the rear. Based on his experience in the Great War, the famous general Ludendorff advocated the theory of total war, believing that in modern warfare, there is no distinction between the front and the rear; the outcome is determined not by the quantity of military equipment, but by the strength of the nation's resources. This no longer limits itself to the clash between the two sides' armies, but becomes a struggle between two major nations.

The ancient saying "victory and defeat are common occurrences for military strategists" is especially true today. After all, temporary gains and losses are hardly sufficient to determine the key to victory. The duration of the war, leading to final victory, truly depends on the resilience of the entire nation, the consolidation of the entire national economy; especially the latter as a prerequisite for long-term war resistance in terms of materials.

Furthermore, modern international relations are intricate and complex; disputes between two countries are often sufficient to initiate conflicts of interest for related third countries and even the entire world. China, which is known as a semi-colony, has always been a battlefield for the great powers to compete. Japan's war against China is undoubtedly aimed at excluding European powers from the Far East, blockading China's door, so that it can enjoy it alone. Therefore, since the September 18th Incident, the Sino-Japanese dispute has long become a major performance on the international political stage. Since the July 7th Incident developed into the August 13th Battle, although the great powers have not performed actively due to various reasons, their sympathy and assistance to China in spirit and material have already been of considerable use. Especially today, after Japan's ambition to swallow China alone has gradually been seen through by the world, it can no longer sit idly by. For example, Britain and the United States have successively issued tough diplomatic notes to Japan and resolutely moved from spiritual sympathy for China to material assistance. Our country is fighting for independent survival and has national resources hundreds of times greater than Japan's as its backing. Whether or not we can obtain foreign resources is not enough to sway our determination to resist the war and our strength to win. However, being able to obtain foreign resources during wartime can indeed make our war resistance strength more substantial. Moreover, our country's industry is backward, and the modern military industry has no foundation to speak of. Therefore, striving for overseas resources is also an indispensable procedure for the great cause of war resistance. The European War ended with the participation of the United States. On the surface, it was because the Allied Powers had the addition of this new force that they were able to defeat the exhausted German army. In essence, it was due to Germany's scarce resources, which made it even more impossible to use overseas resources to make up for them, leading to its rapid collapse.

Our government, in view of this, ordered the stabilization of finances at the beginning of the war, on the one hand, engaged in the relocation of industries inland, promoted industrial cooperative movements, and built the Southwest; enlightened resources and rectified the domestic economy. On the other hand, it maintained creditworthiness, recognized the principle of open doors, expressed welcome to foreign investment, and strived for economic cooperation with friendly countries. Now, after one and a half years of the war, the currency system is stable, the economy is stable, and the consensus of opinions of various countries is praiseworthy.

(2) The International Development of Resisting Aggression

Resisting aggression is based on our resolute resistance to the war, leading to the final victory. If friends from friendly countries can take economic sanctions against the aggressors in accordance with the principles of justice and humanity, then the effort will be twice the result with half the work, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, at the beginning of March, the Chinese delegation in Brussels published the economic conditions for resisting Japan's aggression against China as follows:

(1) Prohibit the supply of military or industrial raw materials to Japan, because Japan's military and industrial raw materials are mostly supplied from abroad; if countries stop supplying, even if limited to a small number of major items, it will inevitably give it a serious blow.

(2) Boycott Japanese goods and Japanese ships. Japan's international balance of payments relies on the export of industrial products and its shipping income to balance it; if countries boycott Japanese goods and Japanese ships, it will not only put its industry to death, but also destroy its entire national economy.

(3) Refuse to extend credit to Japan. Japan's war expenses are huge, and its domestic resources are limited. Without foreign credit, it will not be able to take care of itself, let alone develop the gains of aggression; if countries refuse credit, it will not only make it impossible for it to profit from the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, but it can also strengthen the effectiveness of points one and two.

(4) The economic measures of a considerable number of countries. Because the supply of Japan's raw materials and credit and the market for its exports are concentrated in a small number of countries, these few countries, including the United States, the British Empire, France, and the Andu, Holland, and East India, Belgium, etc., if they break off economic relations with Japan, then Japan will be like a fish out of water and cannot be active.

(5) Assist China, so as to strengthen China's ability to resist the war and resist international aggressive forces, then all peace-loving countries should expand their assistance to China and broadly conduct military and financial assistance.

On the other hand, in early February 1938, the International Executive Committee passed a resolution to aid China, reiterating the resolution of the previous conference: requesting countries to do their best to aid China. At the same time, the international peace movement convened an international boycott conference in London, attended by representatives from twenty countries, who unanimously passed the boycott resolution: severely punishing aggressive behavior. Later, a conference of the international peace movement was convened in Paris, unanimously opposing Japan's indiscriminate killing of innocent people, resolving to boycott Japanese goods, stop the supply of military supplies, encourage loans to China, and resolving to designate the China Aid General Association in London as the central hub of the international China aid movement; from October of the same year, the association also issued an international China aid newsletter once a month to communicate and promote the development of China aid work in various places. Currently, the international China aid work supported by these international peace organizations is generally moving forward along the following three major lines: (1) urging governments of various countries to implement the resolutions of the League of Nations on sanctions against Japan? (2) Expanding the movement to boycott Japanese goods, (3) Donating money, donating medicines and clothing, and providing relief to Chinese wounded soldiers and refugees.

(3) The Achievements of Our Country's Economic Diplomacy

The aforementioned China aid work is all automatically carried out by fair-minded people around the world and is implemented in the form of civil groups, and cannot be regarded as the harvest of our country's economic diplomacy. What is promoted by our government and can be regarded as economic diplomatic work is the effort to win financial assistance from various countries to China. Among the various countries at present, the three major democratic countries of Britain, the United States, and France are the most sympathetic to us and play a pivotal role. These are described separately below.

China and the United States are on both sides of the Pacific Ocean and have always been friendly. Since the signing of the Nine-Power Treaty at the Washington Conference, they have become even more cordial. When the September 18th Incident occurred, former Secretary of State Stimson strongly upheld justice and ran around to appeal, and the League of Nations ultimately passed the non-recognition resolution. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, the people of the country looked up to the United States very much. Although there were isolationists and absolute pacifists in American public opinion, most of them condemned aggression and sympathized with resistance, especially those with a slightly longer-term vision, such as Mr. Stimson and Emory Lucck D. ochD, pastor of the Shanghai International Church, etc., all unanimously advocated the moral responsibility of the United States in the Sino-Japanese war, advocating for active behavior. The famous Far East commentator Nathaniel Pleffer, after observing the results of China's one-year war of resistance, also changed his original position of isolationism and advocated that the beauty should not cooperate with the aggressive country: "Don't buy (Japanese goods) don't sell (military supplies) don't borrow (credit)"; at the same time, cooperate with non-aggressive countries: give them various conveniences). From this, the American public opinion's sympathy for China can be seen.

The post-war Sino-American economic relations that deserve attention are the silver problem and the credit problem.

In 1934, the United States began its silver purchase policy, raising silver prices, and even to the point where China could not maintain the silver standard. In November 1935, it announced the suspension of the silver standard and adopted a managed exchange rate system. In the spring of 1936, our banker Mr. Chen Guangfu was entrusted to visit the United States and signed a silver agreement with U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, in which the United States purchased 50 million taels of Chinese silver at a value of 45 cents per tael.

In July 1937, the first Sino-American agreement expired. At that time, Minister of Finance Kong attended the coronation ceremony of the British Emperor and then visited the United States, and renewed the silver agreement, exchanging silver for gold, for our country's exchange reserves and export credit guarantees.

In July 1938, the agreement expired again; in the next sentence of this month, the Japanese side spread rumors, saying that Britain had plans to convert China's gold currency reserves into international co-management. The U.S. Treasury Secretary officially declared that the U.S. purchase of Chinese silver agreement had been extended; the conditions were largely the same as before.

According to the Citibank Monthly in August. In May 28, the Chinese government asked the U.S. government to continue purchasing silver to help stabilize Sino-American currency relations. The two sides immediately established a rollover agreement, agreeing to exchange Chinese silver for U.S. dollar credit or gold. In the first half of 1938, 140 million taels of Chinese silver were shipped to New York, worth 63 million U.S. dollars. Since October 1937. A total of 190 million taels of silver were shipped, worth 84 million U.S. dollars. Since 1934, the United States has purchased a total of 300 million taels of Chinese silver, and the proceeds from the sale were partially marked as gold and partially used as bank deposits. This is a glimpse of Sino-American monetary cooperation.

However, the destruction of war is infinite, so it is not enough to talk about long-term war resistance unless we strive for construction and enlighten resources, let alone post-war restoration, and it is necessary to utilize foreign credit.

In late September 1938, the Chinese delegation arrived in the United States, still led by banking magnate Mr. Chen Guangfu. On the one hand, they negotiated with the U.S. industry for the supply of military supplies and credit, and on the other hand, they discussed with the U.S. government for loans.

On October 20, the U.S. Treasury Department declared that the negotiations with the Chinese delegation had made progress.

On December 16, the Sino-American $25 million loan was announced, and at the same time, there was good news about the establishment of a Sino-British loan. This credit is for a period of five years and is purely commercial in nature, and most of it will be used to purchase trucks and gasoline.

Sino-British. Since the full-scale war of resistance was launched, our country's coastal ports have been threatened. Tianjin and Shanghai bore the brunt. The focus of foreign trade initially shifted to South China, relying on Hong Kong as its lip and teeth. However, the situation in Guangzhou was precarious and ultimately could not be guaranteed. Therefore, the government from the beginning was eagerly opening up another waterway, opening the "back door," so that foreign supplies and native products could still flow unimpeded.

The Yunnan-Burma Highway has long been under discussion, and the British side's intention to open up trade in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has also been brewing for a long time. However, it must wait for the promotion of the war of resistance before tens of thousands of people work day and night to complete the entire line in a few months and open it to traffic in July 1938. Therefore, Sino-British economic cooperation can take a further step.

Since the Yunnan-Burma Highway was opened to traffic, it has been widely rumored that Britain will borrow money to build the Yunnan-Burma Railway. As Japan openly overturned the Nine-Power Treaty and proposed the so-called East Asia New Order, clearly excluding the rights and interests of foreign merchants, Britain and the United States took joint action and had discussions on retaliation against Japan. The Yulin Times of London reported on December 6 that the Chinese government plans to build 1,000 miles of railway in western China and has ordered 850 steel plate cars from Leeds Company in England, and has also ordered 25 miles of rails for construction, ready to first connect Kunming Dali and then seek to expand.

On December 15, Havas News Agency in London confirmed that a Sino-British loan had been agreed in principle, allocating a loan of £10 million to the Chinese government for the construction of the railway from Xiaguan (near Dali in Yunnan) to the Yunnan-Burma border. The railway plan is entirely managed by British merchants and assisted by the Export Credit Guarantee Department. However, it is heard that the railway cost is only £6 million, and the remaining £4 million can be used to purchase other railway materials and heavy vehicles. In addition, it is rumored that last year's British credit to China was only £500,000, and the recently established Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund of £5 million is the first step in Britain's decision to help China with financial resources.

Although British and American loans are commercial in nature, they also have political implications. Therefore, the national public opinion unanimously welcomes them, such as summarizing them into five points: (1) At this time when the war of resistance has entered the second stage, foreign loans, regardless of size, can encourage the people and inspire morale; (1) Show British and American friendship; (3) Consolidate our determination to respect credit. (4) The political nature of which is quite noteworthy; (5) It is bound to arouse the opposition of the Japanese side, but we are increasingly convinced that we are strong enough to break the dreams of the invaders in Asian empires.

Sino-French. Sino-French relations have always been very good. According to the May-July issue of the Millard's Review, in the article "Southwest Welcomes Foreign Guests" (author Wong Hin), it is said that "a French silver company has established a loan with the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company. The railway management is entirely under the responsibility of the Sichuan-Guizhou Company. Only during the construction period, two French experts are hired to supervise the project. All village materials are purchased on the open market; the loan guarantee is guaranteed by the China Construction Bank (entirely operated by Chinese people) as the only guarantor. The debt revenue and expenditure matters are guaranteed by the Debt Committee organized by the railway company." According to the New York's famous Far Eastern magazine Far Eastern Survey of September 28, in the article on French rights and interests in China, it indicated that this loan is a total of 34.5 million yuan of Chinese national currency, of which 7 million yuan is paid in cash, and the remaining 27.5 million yuan is used to purchase materials.

The above loan method is purely a commercial investment and removes any additional conditions, which is a precedent for Sino-foreign economic cooperation. In the Southwest Railway plan, there is one from Guangxi Nanning to the Vietnamese border, which is of the greatest concern to French interests. Now that British and American loans have set the stage, France has responded.

In the midst of war destruction, we have still obtained the credit and assistance of the great powers, and the Japanese side's activities in the world have only received unanimous condemnation. This is because of the achievements of our country's wartime economic diplomacy. It is also because our country's war of resistance is a mission that any nation should have for independent survival; and it is an indispensable element for ensuring peace in East Asia and even world peace. Therefore, the cooperation of countries around the world with China's wartime economy should be progressing steadily.

### The Current Situation of the New Provincial Capital of Xikang

[Kangding Correspondence] The reporter has been traveling here for nearly two months. After several days of inspection in the provincial capital, I have a rough understanding of the local situation. Now, I will record what I have learned from the investigation as follows.

A Casual Talk About the Past. Kangding was formerly the land of the Sanwei, the Western Qiang during the Shang and Zhou dynasties, and the Maoniu Kingdom during the Han dynasty. In the sixth year of the Jianyuan era of Emperor Wu of Han, a county was established, under the jurisdiction of Qinghai. During Zhuge Liang's southern expedition in the Shu Han Dynasty, Guo Da was sent to Tong'an to appease the region. Da set up furnaces in the mountains of Kangding to make arrows. This is the origin of the name 打箭鑪 (Dajianlu, meaning "arrow-making furnace"). During the Jin Dynasty, it belonged to the Western Rong. During the Tang Dynasty, it was under the jurisdiction of Tubo, and the tea-horse trade became increasingly frequent. This continued from the Five Dynasties to the Song Dynasty. During the Yuan Dynasty, it belonged to the Xifan Changhexi Pacification Commissioner's Office and other offices. In the fifth year of the Yongle era of the Ming Dynasty, the chieftain Awang Jiantai was awarded the title of Ming Zhengzhang for his follow-up expedition, and he was in charge of the two Tusi of Yutong and Yu. He was also the Pacification Commissioner of Ningyuan Military and Civilian Affairs, a hereditary post. In the thirty-ninth year of the Kangxi era of the Qing Dynasty, the Tusi Xila Zhakeba was killed by Tibetan officials Chang Ce Jilie and others. The Governor of Sichuan sent troops to quell the rebellion, and his son Shen Qin Tiande succeeded him. Later, Dajianlu Subprefecture was changed to Tongzhi Hall, under the jurisdiction of Yazhou Prefecture, and the Tusi under its jurisdiction. Ming Zheng was the most respected. In the thirty-first year of the Guangxu era, Feng Quan, the Deputy High Commissioner stationed in Tibet, was killed by Tibetan mobs in Batang due to his obstinacy and self-use. The Qing court appointed Zhao Erfeng as the Border Affairs Minister and led troops to quell the rebellion. After a year of conquest, in the thirty-fourth year of the Guangxu era, Dajianlu was changed to a directly subordinate hall, under the jurisdiction of Jianchang Circuit, and generally in charge of the six grain routes outside the pass. In the third year of the Xuantong era, the land of the three Tusi was changed to counties. In the early years of the Republic of China, Yin Changheng led his army on the Western Expedition and changed Dajianlu to Kangding Prefecture. A Pacification Office was established in the prefectural city, with various departments set up, and he served as the Pacification Commissioner, commanding the various armies and administering the various counties. In the second year of the Republic of China, because the Ministry of Internal Affairs standardized the national administrative regions, it was changed to Kangding County, and Anliang County was merged into it. In this year, the establishment of Xikang Province was realized, and it was immediately made the provincial capital. The provincial government was established here, and the county government remained the same. The Kangding Municipal Committee is now established. Xikang belongs to Sichuan and Yunnan internally, controls Tibet externally, connects Myanmar to the south, and connects Qinghai to the north. Since ancient times, it has been a key area in the western border. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, Li, the Qing court believed that the situation in Tibet and Tibet was critical, with strong neighbors coveting it externally and border people rebelling internally. Therefore, Zhao Erfeng was specially appointed as the Sichuan-Yunnan Border Affairs Minister to actively manage and prepare for the establishment of a province. Zhao was able to obtain sufficient assistance from the central government and the assistance of neighboring provinces. He handled the reform of the entire border, and the military power made the barbarian tribes submit. Within a few years, more than thirty counties were established. At that time, Zhao was stationed in Ba'an, believing that the city had a mild climate, abundant products, and an important situation, no less than the southern border fence. He planned to set it as the capital, and all the planned provincial plans were centered on Ba'an. People from Sichuan Province and the British and French people who preached to Ba'an rose up in large numbers, and Ba'an had already taken the shape of a provincial capital. However, due to the overturning of the Qing court, the Tibetan bandits took the opportunity to commit crimes internally, and more than a dozen counties in Kangxi were successively lost. The people in charge of border affairs have been changed repeatedly, perfunctory and tolerant, and the situation has deteriorated. After the 24th Army Commander Liu Wenhui's troops took over the defense, they immediately recovered Dengke, Dege, Baiyu, and Shiqu counties by force, completing the ruling situation east of the Jinsha River. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the bandits have entered deeper and the territory has shrunk. Xikang is not only a barrier to the southwest, but also the center of international transportation. Kangding has always been the hub of Sichuan-Tibet transportation. Now, it is the provincial capital of Xikang, and the military and politics are both important, and it has formed an important town in the western border.

### Valiant Charity Worker - A Friend of China in China (9)

— Ye Juesun

On one hand, due to the convenience of the headquarters' car, and on the other hand, thanks to Section Chief Liang's introduction that there were several foreigners serving at the Hexi Hospital, Li Meng and his wife wanted to visit them. The hospital was located west of Qujiang in Shaoguan, so everyone called it "Hexi Hospital." But its real name was "Methodist Hospital." It was founded by the British Christian Church. The car crossed the wooden bridge over the Qujiang River, followed the riverside road, and after six or seven minutes, arrived at the hospital gate. It was surrounded by large trees, backed by mountains and facing water, with extremely beautiful scenery. Upon entering the hospital, all the facilities, equipment, and displays gave us an impression of cleanliness and order. On the walls hung many new-style plaques such as "Miraculous Hands Bring Back Spring" and "Hua Tuo Reborn"... The inscription next to the mirror indicated that they were gifts to Dr. Xia Dao-xi. Unexpectedly, this Xia Dao-xi, who was called "Hua Tuo Reborn," was the foreign doctor we wanted to see. His English name was Roy Horgetl. I became very interested in this "Foreign Hua Tuo." I really couldn't imagine what kind of person he was. After a while, Dr. Xia came. Like the other two people I had met today, the first thing I noticed was that he also had a small mustache under his nose. He wasn't a tall fellow, wearing a white doctor's uniform, holding a pipe in his hand, his face full of smiles, and his eyes constantly looking at us shrewdly. One look and you knew he was a very capable character. After introducing ourselves to each other, Mr. Xia Dao-xi invited us to sit on the porch in front of his room. The porch was covered with a thin carpet. The five of us sat on small rattan chairs around the table, on which were placed several English magazines and newspapers. I hadn't seen such things for a long time, and I couldn't help but be happy to see them again. Mr. Xia also took out two photo albums for us to look at. There were many images of enemy planes diving straight down from high altitude while bombing Shaoguan, and many tragic scenes after the bombing, including children with broken legs, and corpses of mothers and children lying together... Looking at them made our hair stand on end, and our hearts were filled with indescribable anger. Later, Dr. Xia pointed to two damaged Chinese planes parked on the airfield, and said: "We cannot but admire the bravery and composure of the pilots in these planes. When this plane was engaged in an air battle with the enemy in Nanxiong, although it had victoriously shot down the enemy, it had also suffered considerable damage itself. According to ordinary reasoning, the pilots would most likely have parachuted down to protect themselves. However, this pilot was still able to bring the plane back to the base with the greatest courage. This kind of skill and this great spirit are indeed worthy of respect from pilots all over the world..." He spoke with great enthusiasm, and we listened with great interest. Then he said: "Since Shaoguan began to suffer from air raids, many privately-run hospitals have successively closed down. Only one military hospital and our place are left. The military hospital only treats wounded soldiers and military personnel from the front lines, so for a year, all the civilians injured in the air raids have been treated here. Because of our hospital's funding, we still charge a considerable fee for patients, including food and lodging. First-class wards are one yuan a day, and second-class wards are 75 cents in national currency per day. For this reason, many very poor people are still unable to be hospitalized. We feel very uneasy about this, but we are powerless to do anything about it..." This "Hua Tuo Reborn" foreign doctor was right. During this period, on the one hand, he was serving, and on the other hand, he was actually learning. He said: "The injuries of civilians in the bombing are very different. If you rely solely on what you learned in school in the past, there is no way to cope with them. In the new era, treating diseases really requires diligent research and the use of various different methods. In this year, I have seen many unexpected ways of getting injured, and therefore I have also learned many new treatment methods..." As for medicine, Li Meng and his wife and I are all complete "laymen," so apart from sitting quietly and listening attentively, like a primary school student in class, there was really no way to interrupt. I felt that his experience was indeed very precious. When China is in the midst of a great era of turmoil, not only doctors, but people from all walks of life, must have the spirit of serving and learning at the same time. Otherwise, the changes of the times are too fast, and the changes in the environment are too many. Relying solely on old methods will definitely not be able to meet new demands.

Just as we were talking happily, there was a sound on the stairs, and then a very handsome blond foreign man ran up. Like Xia Dao-xi, he could also speak fluent and authentic Cantonese. He had been in China for two years longer than Xia Dao-xi, for a full nine years. Xia got up and introduced us to each other. He was a pastor at the local British church, named W. H. Alton, with the Chinese name Qu Dao-bi. This gentleman paid great attention to his posture when speaking, with the demeanor of Hollywood. Like the color of his hair, his small mustache was also golden yellow, sparse and soft, and looked very interesting. I thought to myself, why is it so strange today? Everyone I've met has a mustache. Could this be the feng shui of Shaoguan! The servant called to Xia Dao-xi, "The refreshments are ready!" So we ran into the living room, which was decorated quite exquisitely, and the refreshments were also very elaborate, with good canned milk, sugar cubes, and cakes, said to be mostly from Hong Kong.

After the refreshments, Xia accompanied us to visit the wards, pharmacies... Although there weren't many rooms, they could only accommodate about five or six hundred people, but the orderly and tidy appearance was lovely to see. Here, apart from Dao-xi, all the doctors and nurses were Chinese. Their relationship was very good, and their skills were also excellent. According to Xia, the standard of these nurses was no lower than that of nurses in many large hospitals in England. Later, we also visited a nurse's bedroom. The whole room was a snowy white. On the wall hung photos of Shirley Temple (transliteration, please use the most common one) and Xia Dao-xi. The innocent smile of this child star made the air in the house particularly relaxed and lively. I thought that if this beautiful girl's room was placed on the pages of a book about the entire situation in China, it would be like a pair of butterflies full of vivid emotions and beautiful colors, fluttering around the muzzle of a cannon filled with gunpowder. After leaving this "little paradise," on the opposite side, we could see many stoves that had been unused for a long time. It was said that in the past, family members could accompany patients into the hospital, and these stoves were used for the family members to cook for the patients. Now, because the hospital is crowded, the patients' family members cannot stay in the hospital, so these stoves have gradually become deserted! In the equipment room, there were many new glass cabinets and medical equipment. We asked Dao-xi in surprise, "Now that transportation is so difficult, how were these things transported here?" He replied, "This is entirely done by the local workers themselves." Learning in the War of Resistance, the workers' skills have also improved rapidly. We took a photo with the nurses and doctors in the hospital, and then shook hands with this valiant charity worker to say goodbye. Before leaving, I asked this "Friend of China" to write an article for our International News Agency, with his work experience as the theme. He agreed and said, "I'll hand it in tomorrow."

### Mobilizing the Power of the Entire Nation - President Chiang's Broadcast Address - Demonstrating the Great Significance of Spiritual Mobilization - To Be Fully Implemented Starting Next Month

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] The Second Term of the Second Propaganda Week, President Chiang was respectfully invited to deliver a broadcast address at 7:00 PM on the 17th. The original text is recorded as follows: Compatriots across the country, we are now implementing the National Spiritual Mobilization. Starting next month, we must all follow the "National Spiritual Mobilization Outline" and its "Implementation Measures" promulgated by the Central Government on March 12th across the country. We will hold "National Monthly Meetings" to declare the "National Covenant" and also follow the various regulations stipulated in the "Outline" to encourage and supervise each other, and earnestly implement them. Everyone must know that this is the most important event related to the survival of the country, the life and death of the nation, and the success or failure of the War of Resistance. I ask our compatriots across the country, especially leaders from all walks of life, to pay special attention to this major event and sincerely promote it. Why is it necessary to implement "National Spiritual Mobilization"? This is already stated very clearly in the "Outline." What I want to emphasize again is that first, we must acknowledge that the greatness of spiritual strength surpasses all material forces and all military power. Second, we must reflect on the shortcomings in our spiritual aspects in the past. What is spirit? Our Founding Father said it most succinctly. Our Founding Father said, "Everything that is not material is spirit." However, our Founding Father did not say that spirit and matter are absolutely separate, but that the two are united and mutually supportive. Our Founding Father also said, "If humanity loses its spirit, then it must not be a completely independent person." Everyone, think about it, what a shocking lesson this is. If an individual loses his spirit, he is not a completely independent person. Then, if a nation loses its spirit, wouldn't it be a nation unworthy of independent survival? The art of war says, "Attacking the mind is paramount." The so-called attacking the mind is to strike at the opponent's spirit. Therefore, the success or failure of all struggles in the world depends entirely on the strength and weakness of the spirit. Tangible material or military strength cannot determine victory or defeat. Our Founding Father theorized about the use of weapons, which depends entirely on the spirit of the people. He once said, "Comparing the two, spiritual strength accounts for nine parts, and material strength only accounts for one part." All comrades who have participated in battles can cite countless examples to prove that this saying is accurate and irrefutable. We only need to look at since the War of Resistance, on our front lines, there are often less than a few soldiers who can resist the ×'s for several days, and even be able to repel ten times more ×'s. There are also old, weak women who can resist violence and kill × in self-defense with their bare hands. Many things that were usually considered unimaginable or impossible can become reality beyond expectations in difficult and dangerous situations. Therefore, only those who have lost their spirit can only see material things and not see spirit, only estimate tangible strength and ignore intangible strength. In fact, to defeat the ×'s and successfully build our country in this war, we must rely heavily on giving full play to the spiritual strength of every member of our nation. Moreover, the closer we get to victory, the more difficult, arduous, and dangerous our environment will inevitably become. We must mobilize the entire spiritual strength of our nation to seek final success. Therefore, at this critical juncture of life and death, success or failure, our compatriots must affirm the greatness of spiritual strength. This is the first point I want to explain.

### The "Hong Kong Telegraph" Publishes an Article: "Look at China!" - Praising Our Counter-Offensive Power - Shattering the ×'s Conspiracy for Peace

Yesterday, the English "Hong Kong Telegraph" published an article titled "Look at China!" praising the power of our army's counter-offensive. From the exposure of the ×'s weakness, it revealed the victory of our country's future. The original text is as follows:

Three important pieces of news were released in Hong Kong last week: (1) British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, hurriedly returned to Chongqing from Shanghai; (2) The Chinese army launched a simultaneous counter-offensive in five provinces, achieving significant success in at least three provinces; (3) The sudden transfer of the American "Great Fleet" (totaling 120 ships) to the Pacific. Kerr hastily returned to Chongqing after meeting with Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, in Shanghai, leading to rumors of British mediation in the Sino-Japanese War. Craigie has affirmed that the content of the conversation with Kerr did not discuss mediation. However, why did the two suddenly meet thousands of miles away? Kerr refused to announce the purpose of meeting with Craigie and refused to meet with Hong Kong reporters on this trip, an unprecedented act since Kerr's arrival in China. Some observers here deeply believe that the three pieces of news mentioned above are directly related to the situation in Europe.

The Chinese army's active counter-offensive last week dispersed the Japanese army's strength, and its impact on Japan's finances and economy has obviously become increasingly heavy. China has been fighting alone so far, and the assistance given to China by the West is very small. However, China is still able to be indomitable. If the major Western democracies can provide large-scale assistance from now on, then the future embarrassment of the Japanese will be unimaginable. The result of China's heroic resistance to Japan's violent aggression has invisibly caused a major blow to the totalitarian group. Although Japan intends to respond to Germany and Italy in any disputes, given its current situation, it is powerless to do so. If it is absolutely necessary, it can only temporarily control the North Pacific, which is of no help. If the major Western European democracies can fully assist China and the Chinese army can exert its greatest power, then Japan will no longer be a threat to the European situation. Because under this circumstance, Japan is too busy to take care of itself, how can it provide any assistance to the Allied countries in Western Europe?

### Madam Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, Arrived in Chongqing Yesterday Morning

[Our newspaper, Chongqing, 17th Dispatch] Madam Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, flew back here from Hong Kong this morning.

### Our Army Launches a Large-Scale Counter-Offensive - Fierce Fighting Outside Xuzhou - The Eighth Route Army Occupies Shijiazhuang - Successes on All Fronts in Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, and Hubei

[Our newspaper, Chongqing, 17th Dispatch] In eastern Shandong, we have attacked the × for days, killing over 300 ×. We occupied Yao Gou, Yi Jia Chang Zi, and other stations on the Jiaoji Railway, setting them on fire and demolishing the rails, disrupting transportation. In western Shandong, we attacked × Cheng, annihilating over 30 × at Zhang Keng, capturing 28 people, and a large amount of military supplies.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 17th] According to Chinese reports, the Eighth Route Army, in cooperation with Shi Yousan's troops, has eliminated hundreds of small Japanese units in the Shijiazhuang area and occupied key military strongholds, sufficient to control the entire city. Several sections of the Pinghan Railway have also been destroyed by the Chinese army to cut off the Japanese army's reinforcement route in Pingjin. A Chinese army unit has also stormed into the city, re-occupying Shijiazhuang Railway Station. The fighting there is the most intense. According to another report, 70,000 Chinese troops are counter-attacking Xuzhou, and fierce fighting is currently taking place outside Xuzhou. Several sections of the Longhai Railway have been destroyed by the Chinese army, causing the front-line Japanese army to lose contact with the rear. The Chinese army's artillery has been bombarding Xuzhou, and undercover troops have entered the city to participate in the fighting, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese army.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] Shanghai news, news of the Chinese army's victorious counter-offensive continues to be received here. According to the latest reports, Liuhe at the mouth of the Yangtze River has been recaptured by the Chinese army. Another message says that 20,000 Chinese troops are currently attacking Xuzhou in three directions.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 16th] A certain unit of our army in northern Henan detoured and launched a fierce flanking attack on the side of the ×, who fled towards Bo'ai. Our army is now advancing towards Zhuan'ai.

[Central News Agency, Zao Yang, 16th] After our recapture of Shijiatian and Zhujiatian, the remaining × fled back to Xinyang. Our army pursued and attacked, arriving at Xian Mountain (three or four li west of Xinyang) on the outskirts of Xinyang at six o'clock on the morning of the 15th and launching a fierce attack. The battle was extremely fierce. Our army fought bravely, killing many ×. The fighting continued fiercely into the night.

[Our newspaper, Chongqing, 16th Dispatch] In central Hubei, our × has been engaged in fierce fighting with the × at Xiaojiadian on the Jingzhong Road for three days, killing over 200 × and destroying 5 × vehicles. Over 600 × are now resisting stubbornly on the high ground near Wudangdian. About 500 × in Zhongxiang City are actively blocking intersections and are very panicked. The × cavalry repeatedly attacked Majiaji from Jingqiao to attack our flank, but were defeated.

### The Japanese Army in North China is Besieged on All Sides - Intense Fighting in the Zhongtiao Mountains - Anti-Japanese Democratic Governments Established One After Another - Sino-Soviet and Other Countries Jointly Form a Bank

[Xingji Electric, 17th] The situation is going smoothly as our army launches an offensive in various parts of North China. Yesterday, a telegram from Wuyuan reported that our guerrillas in northern Suiyuan launched another fierce attack on Bailin Temple, inflicting heavy damage on the ×. Conflicts between the Mongolian army and the × also occurred nearby. In addition, our army in northwestern Shanxi launched a counter-offensive on Jingle on the 11th night, attacking into the north gate. Fierce fighting is still ongoing.

[Yuanqu Electric, 16th] The × in the Zhongtiao Mountains has suffered extremely heavy losses in the fighting for days. In order to reverse the decline, the × even released a large number of toxic gas shells, mostly sneezing and suffocating toxic gases. The intensity and bravery of our army's counter-offensive operations in the Zhongtiao Mountains for a week can be compared to the "Battle of Xinkou." What is different from the Battle of Xinkou is that this time the action is entirely our army taking the offensive, and our army is the initiator. A telegram from the front on the 15th stated that our army's artillery exerted great power when attacking Xia County on the 13th, killing and wounding a total of 500 ×. The × in Yicheng is also under our army's encirclement. Over 1,000 × in Quwo planned to rescue Yicheng and encountered our army at Nanfan Town and Dajiao Town. After fierce fighting until noon, the ×, due to heavy casualties, fled back to Quwo in a panic, and part of them fled to Yicheng. Our army has now advanced to the line near Yicheng and is engaged in fierce fighting with the ×. The number of × in Wenxi has increased to over 2,000. On the morning of the 15th, they launched a full-scale counter-offensive against our army in Ruyi Shangxia Chao (southeast of Wenxi). The war was extremely fierce, and the confrontation is still ongoing. Our army is also sweeping up the × in Zhangzhen and Weiguozhen (southeast of Wenxi), and another unit is continuing to attack the mountain temple.

[People's Revolution Society, Xingji Electric, 17th] According to news, the cultural circles' North China troop comforting delegation, Zang Yunyuan, recently presented flags to Commander-in-Chief Yan Xishan of the military region, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, and various guerrilla detachments in North China on the western battlefield. They have now arrived at a certain place. It is said that cultural work in the × region is progressing rapidly. In many guerrilla base areas, the prototype of democratic politics has been completed. The people in the × region have been armed with both spirit and physical strength in the arduous struggle over the years, and are fully capable of dealing with the × for a long time.

[People's Revolution Society, Xingji Electric, 17th] According to news, the Sino-British-American-French-Soviet Five-Nation Joint Bank has its headquarters in Tianjin, and branches have been established in Shijiazhuang and Baoding. The Taiyuan branch is under preparation. Recently, banknotes of the bank have been found in a certain place, but the × strictly prohibits their use. Outside the new south gate of Taiyuan, someone has been shot for using the banknotes. The background color of the banknotes is pink, and the images of the leaders of the four countries of Britain, America, France, and the Soviet Union are printed in the four corners, with the image of Chairman Chiang in the center.

### British Ambassador Clark Kerr Will Go to Chongqing Tomorrow to Return to His Post - Says There is No Special Mission

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 16th] British Ambassador Clark Kerr came to Yunnan from Vietnam yesterday. The reporter visited this morning. According to the conversation, this trip to Chongqing is to return to his post. In addition to maintaining close contact with the central government at any time, there is no special mission. The rumors that I met with Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie in Shanghai to discuss the Far East issue are not true. It is heard that the ambassador will fly to Chongqing on the 19th.

### We Purchased 1,300 Heavy-Duty Trucks - Driving on the Yunnan-Burma Road

[Kunming Correspondence] Since its opening to traffic, the Yunnan-Burma Road has been extremely convenient for military transportation and foreign trade. However, there has recently been a shortage of vehicles on the road. The Central Purchasing Committee will order 1,300 three-ton and seven-ton heavy-duty vehicles from various countries to meet this need. The payment will be allocated from the British credit loan to China established in December.

### Hashimoto, the Leader of the Youth Party, Was Removed from His Post by the Japanese Military Department

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 17th] The "Mainichi Shimbun" here stated that the Japanese Military Department has dismissed Colonel Hashimoto. According to reports, the artillery team under Colonel Hashimoto fired on the British warship "Ladybird" in Wuhu in December 1937. He is also the leader of the "Greater Japan Youth Fascist Party."

### The Fall of Xinhui and Its Aftermath

— He Xiyao

(1) The Situation Before the Fall

Since Daliang and Ronggui successively fell, the path of the × invaders' attack clearly indicated an attempt to control the Five Counties. However, the Xinhui County government and the public remained remarkably calm in this grave situation. On March 28th, the people of Xinhui were still living peaceful lives; merchants carried on with their business as usual, and students attended school as normal. Only the local military and volunteer police forces showed some signs of tension. Around 10 PM that day, news arrived that × forces had been spotted on Pig Head Mountain outside Beijie. Knowing that things were not looking good, many people rushed around to inquire whether the news was true or false, and many others began to feel anxious and uneasy. At this point, due to the urgency of the situation, the authorities prepared to evacuate the population, and shops began hiring boats to move goods. However, since it was already late at night, not much could be done, so most people waited until the next day. Still, a few left overnight, heading back to their villages. The 29th was the Huanghuagang Memorial Day. By morning, the situation had become extremely serious. The roads were jammed with fleeing crowds, carrying the old and the young, their clothes dishevelled and untidy, their expressions panicky. Most carried only some cotton bedding and a few items of everyday clothing. In Jiangmen and Xinhui, some shops were closed and boarded up, while others were only half-open, and business was almost at a standstill. That day, fourteen or fifteen × aircraft constantly circled the skies above Jiangmen, and bombs exploded non-stop near Jiangmen's county seat, often in batches of over a hundred. The fleeing people anxiously speculated about the unfortunate fate awaiting Jiangmen and its county seat. That day, people could only try to survive under constant bombing. The highway between Jiangmen and Xinhui was automatically destroyed and burned. Only the stone roads in the various villages were passable. Ferries to and from the villages were overcrowded, and countless people hired their own boats to escape. On this day, the population evacuated from Jiangmen and Xinhui exceeded fifty percent. On the 30th, Jiangmen unfortunately fell. Those in the Xinhui county seat who had not had time to escape, or who had remained calm and not yet thought about fleeing, now successively fled to the countryside. The county seat had become a ghost town.

However, it should be specifically pointed out here that in the hour before Jiangmen and Xinhui fell, all intersections were guarded by volunteer police, and public order was still very good. By the 31st, the sound of gunfire could be heard in the Xinhui county seat. However, what was most surprising was that even then, some hawkers were still doing business, and vegetable and pork stalls were still set up in the market. However, rice had become a precious commodity. On April 1st, the sound of gunfire became clearer and clearer. On the morning of April 2nd, the sound of gunfire was deafening, and people anticipated that engagements had already occurred on the outskirts of the county seat. Around 11 AM, Xinhui county seat, following Jiangmen, was declared lost. By 2 or 3 PM, × armored vehicles were driving down the streets of the county seat.

(2) A Platoon Leader's Account

When the Xinhui county seat fell, this reporter immediately braved the rain and fled to the countryside. Here, I met a platoon leader of the Xinshun Special Task Force. The reporter immediately inquired about the progress of our army's resistance, because the Xinshun Special Task Force had established many glorious achievements in this resistance in Xinhui. The following is a record of his report:

We supported Jiangmen and Xinhui for three or four days in this resistance against the × forces, and have already sacrificed many brothers. If there were no traitors guiding or collaborating from within, we are confident that we could have held out longer, even with our inferior weapons. These traitors are mostly a small number of local thugs and vagrants. This may be due to the inadequacy of our political mobilization work.

However, Commander Zhou, with tears in his eyes, said to the whole team of brothers, "It is not worth it to lose Jiangmen like this." At that time, I almost cried too. Later, Commander Zhou ordered us and the volunteer police force to defend the Baisha defense line to the death. We were even more determined to die, doing our best to prevent the × forces from breaking through. However, they finally used armored forces to break through. There were twelve armored vehicles in total, followed by several hundred cavalry. In order to preserve our strength, we were forced to withdraw from the first line of defense and hold fast to the Dahui village in the second line of defense. There, we used the favorable terrain to set up machine guns and hastily build fortifications. At that time, we only had ×× hundred people, including the volunteer police. That night, Commander Li Wuzi instructed the able-bodied men from various villages in Dongjia to destroy the section of highway from Dahui to Guabao Temple. However, because of the urgency, only half of the road was destroyed overnight. The purpose of destroying this section of highway was to stop the × armored vehicles from advancing. Soon, the security team came to reinforce us. Two cannons were set up in the mountains of Dahui village, and they thundered, firing at the × positions. The × forces must have suffered considerable casualties. On this defense line, the × army launched four offensives after several reinforcements, but they could not break through. However, what made us most excited was Commander Li Wuzi. For the sake of resisting the × forces, he didn't close his eyes all night, personally supervising the battle.

Later, in the midst of a fierce wind and heavy rain, we found ourselves in an unfavorable situation. We knew that we had to fight to the death, so we fixed bayonets and charged forward. Because the × forces had the cover of armored vehicles and cavalry, we fought and killed hundreds of × and puppet soldiers before reluctantly withdrawing and shifting our position, holding fast to the east gate of Xinhui county seat. But we couldn't hold out for long. × troops then encircled us from Huimin Gate, and we had to reluctantly retreat along the highway to Daze and other places, preparing to counterattack at any time. In short, the × forces attacking Jiangmen this time were mostly miscellaneous troops with very weak combat power. When the × forces came, the armored vehicles led the way, followed by the cavalry, and then the miscellaneous troops brought up the rear.

(3) The Tragedy of Xinhui

On the 30th, after Jiangmen was lost, the stores along Changdi were unable to move their goods due to the suddenness of the event, and many were looted. At night, local thugs and thieves in Hetou Mayuan, near the countryside on the Henan side, rose up, smashing doors and destroying houses. Even bed boards and furniture were looted clean. Because there was so much looting, some used boats to carry the stolen goods, while others used army towing vehicles. Raw oil, peanuts, and soybeans were spilled everywhere. It is said that a fellow in Pengjiang was shot dead by × soldiers for being unable to find a girl for them. The situation in Beijie was the same. Fortunately, when the × soldiers came, many women had fled. After the Xinhui county seat fell, the situation was like that in Jiangmen city. Stores were occasionally searched and robbed, but not often. The worst affected area was Chan Court Street, because it was close to the river and neighbors and local bandits entered through the back door, using boats to carry stolen goods. However, because the Xinhui county seat fell later, stores had some time to move some goods, so the losses were somewhat smaller. Those who had people guarding their doors fared better. Those who were unguarded were often smashed and destroyed. All roads were guarded by × or puppet soldiers. Pedestrians had to bow when they saw them, and even a few cents in their pockets would be searched and taken away. In the first day or two after the Xinhui county seat fell, people were rounded up everywhere to carry corpses, fill in roads, and build fortifications. After the work was done, they were given a dime or two. From this chaotic state, we can see how the × forces entice our people and the importance of our work in mobilizing the people. Moreover, the looting by ruffians and local thugs before and after the fall is a distressing situation, and it must be considered a major political lesson. In the second phase of the war of resistance, Chairman Chiang declared: "Politics is more important than military affairs, and propaganda is more important than combat." This is something we should redouble our efforts on.

The × Advance Team is currently stationed in Cen Richu's mansion. The × cavalry is stationed in the Dayunshan civilian hospital. The county government has been converted into the × Command Headquarters, heavily guarded. Passage is only allowed after 8 AM during the day, and no one is allowed to enter or leave after 6 PM. At night, it is a world of thieves. The × army even instigated the Advance Team to issue announcements pacifying the people, which was all nonsense. Because the people were not deceived, they then ordered the shops to reopen, otherwise their property would be confiscated. Some shopkeepers, who still had some goods left, had no choice but to half-open their doors. In order to restore prosperity, the × army gave some small favors and small amounts of money to the people. Sometimes they could buy seven or eight sheng of rice for a dime or two. At the Nantian Teahouse on Daxin Street, the × army gave several packs of biscuits, telling the staff to open for business. Gambling dens were rampant in the area around the southern corner of Daxin Road. Shops along the road that were guarded were forced to hang × flags, with the words "Welcome the Great Japanese Imperial Army" written on them.

In recent days, the × army has been busy building defensive fortifications in various places in the suburbs of the city. Sandbags have been piled up everywhere. Places like Xihekou and Dayunshan are all garrisoned by × troops, and passage is not allowed. Currently, our army is preparing a counterattack in a certain location. In the progress of this counterattack, we must overcome the errors of insufficient past political mobilization. Because if we can mobilize the people, all traitors can be eliminated, all local thugs and thieves can be cleared, and we can also build a strong people's force to drive the × forces out of Xinhui. The × forces are increasingly collapsing. The soldiers and civilians of Xinhui, let us get up and take action! Overcome our mistakes, launch a heroic and bloody battle, and defend our homeland!

### Significant Gains in Northern Jiangxi, Successful Guerrilla Warfare in Western Zhejiang, Our Forces Continue to Advance in South China

[Chongqing, 17th] In the Jiangxi battlefront, our forces have now firmly established an advantageous position. Our guerilla forces are extremely active in the suburbs of Nanchang. Our main forces are currently approaching Liantang and Xiangtang, causing extreme panic among the ×. It is reported that about a thousand × troops stationed in Nanchang city are plundering civilian property and massacring the people. Many corpses are exposed along Zhongshan Road, Zhengzhong Road, and Guohuo Road, and no one has buried them to this day. The situation is extremely tragic. On the night of the 14th, the × forces from Gao'an fired artillery shells at the southern bank of the Jinhe River and set off smoke bombs. At the same time, dozens of × soldiers attempted to cross the river in civilian boats. They were discovered by our forces and immediately engaged, sinking several boats and killing more than thirty × soldiers. Also, according to Shanghai news, our air force has been active on the eastern front recently. At the end of the month, they carried out a night raid on the Qiaotou Airport in Hangzhou. The × side suffered heavy losses. On the afternoon of the 13th, our planes again flew in formation to attack Hangzhou, dropping multiple bombs on Qiaotou Airport and conducting reconnaissance over the city for a week before safely returning to base. At that time, the × side used anti-aircraft guns to fire wildly into the air, but no × aircraft took off to intercept them.

[Central News Agency, Jinhua, 16th] Our guerilla forces in Zhejiang have become even more active recently, focusing on impeding the × main forces on the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway. The area southwest of Wuxing is particularly intense. Our infantry and artillery forces cooperated to bomb Wukang, Sanqiao, and Shantang on the 11th, killing hundreds of × soldiers. Our forces have been engaged in fierce battles for days in Qingshan City and Shijiaqiao, eliminating over three hundred × soldiers.

[Wengyuan, 17th (Special Dispatch)] Our forces on both sides of the Zengjiang River have been besieging Zengcheng for days, achieving successive victories. On the night of the 13th, a commando unit occupied the north gate and charged into the city. Our main forces continued to advance, and on the 14th and 15th, they defeated the × forces which had repeatedly advanced from Shitang to the north, attempting to encircle us in the west gate area of Zengcheng. The troops immediately turned to Zengcheng to assist with the attack and occupied the city on the night of the 15th. The remnants of the × forces fled to Xiangluogang. In this battle, many × officers and soldiers were killed, and countless firearms, ammunition, and other military supplies were captured. Our forces also suffered considerable casualties. However, the Zengcheng city has been completely burned down by the × forces and reduced to rubble. In order to expand the victory of mobile warfare, our forces have advanced towards Taipingchang, flanking the invading × army.

### The Battle of Mabudashan (Report 2)

— Zhang Changren

Until March 20th, the brothers of the Third Battalion did not encounter strong resistance, yet they were ready to strike the enemy with considerable force at any moment. Five months of replenishment and training had given even a new recruit the air of a battle-hardened "old soldier," brimming with saturated battle intent. They searched, and the local people also searched. Everywhere were our eyes, everywhere our snares. Every day, the brothers brought farmers from several or more than ten miles away to report enemy activities to Camp Commander Cheng, inspected the intelligence gathered from various sources, and learned that the total number of enemies in the three strongholds was less than two thousand. The × troops in Yuegui city numbered no more than four hundred. Camp Commander Cheng decided to use the strength of two companies to attack Guozhen City in a plunging fashion, with one company as a reserve force, guarding against × forces outflanking our right wing from the direction of Xinkaitang near Maolipu.

The × forces, knowing their own weakness, attempted to defeat our advancing troops one by one. At 10:00 AM on March 31st, the × forces gathered 1,300 troops south of Guozhen City, supported by ten artillery pieces, to launch a counterattack against our forces advancing to the northern foothills of Mabudashan. Camp Commander Cheng immediately ordered the companies to occupy superior terrain and await the opportunity to attack.

The soldiers who had participated in several battles felt that a war without a free sky above them could not be called a war. Each of them had confidence in their ability to deal with the × forces and felt that a great achievement was at hand. They carefully concealed themselves in the pine forests, gullies, and dead angles of the × fire, only revealing the dark, round muzzles of their guns.

The × artillery began firing. In less than a quarter of an hour, more than a hundred rounds were fired. Camp Commander Cheng sat not far behind between the First and Second Companies, calmly observing the explosions of the enemy shells. His eyes revealed a smile, feeling that the × artillery had regressed again, either overshooting or falling short. He picked up a piece of shrapnel that had fallen behind him and found the inscription "Made in March of the 13th Year of Showa." "Haha, let's see how many shells you have left," he couldn't help but laugh.

Shells continued to explode to the left and right, in front and behind of the position. The dust and the smell of gunpowder mingled, and some were incendiary bombs, setting fire to the grass and trees of the spring wilderness in places. The soldiers held their guns in one hand and broke off pine branches to put out the fire with the other. Private Wang Yuanming had a large piece of shrapnel fly into his chest. He opened his uniform, pulled it out with his hand, and tightly stuffed his uniform into the wound to stop the bleeding, continuing to focus his bloodshot eyes on the creeping × forces. He gripped a hand grenade with his trembling right hand and used his left hand to pull open the safety.

In front of the positions of the First and Second Companies, there was a dead angle. But they could see each other. When the × forces entered the dead angle of the First Company, the brothers of the Second Company shouted loudly, "First Company, Japanese ××× are hiding under your position, throw hand grenades quickly!" So the brothers of the First Company pulled the safety pins, "One, two, three," and threw them down together. The Second Company shouted again, "Good, five dead, there are still eight live turtles!" Another burst of "Beng," "Beng," and the "Imperial Army" let out a groan, dying like "Turtle Taro." When the × forces approached the Second Company, the brothers of the First Company shouted in the same way, serving as the death knell for the "Imperial Army."

The × army's machine gunners were accustomed to firing in three-round bursts, "Da, da, da," meaning, "Are you afraid or not?" Our Czech-style machine guns immediately answered with two-round bursts, "Da, da," saying, "Not afraid." Then they asked him again, "Afraid or not!" Individual firing also began. Sniper Zhang Qingxiang and a Japanese soldier were shooting at each other, neither giving way, dodging each other's shots within a hundred meters for more than ten shots. Finally, Zhang Qingxiang lost patience. He no longer dodged, and they fired simultaneously. After this shot, the other side did not raise his head again. He re-selected another target to shoot. Old Zhang was a good shooter who often scored thirty rings (note). This time, he was wounded after shooting his thirteenth × soldier.

Mortarman Li Hualong was from Shandong, as strong as an ox. He took the mortar barrel off the stand, clamped it under his arm, and had another brother observe in front, specifically targeting the × army's machine guns. In one breath, he fired thirty or forty rounds, making the × army's machine gunners only hate that there wasn't a hole to burrow into. He was too excited to fire when an × artillery shell pierced his chest, and he fell down like a small mountain. He lost too much blood and gasped, "Good brothers, I've already made a profit. I'm useless now. Please give me a finishing shot!" Camp Commander Cheng crawled over with tears in his eyes. Seeing that his intestines were also coming out, and there was no hope of saving him, he painfully ordered a brother to give him a finishing shot, and immediately sent a stretcher to carry him to the rear for burial.

There was an eighteen-year-old "good boy" from Baoji, Shaanxi. The brothers only called him "Little Chicken." He didn't care about his real name. He was hit by five machine-gun bullets in both calves. The brothers tried to persuade him to go down, but he angrily said, "Why won't you let me kill Japanese devils? I still have eight hand grenades. Whoever tells me to go down, I'll blow them up first!" He used two, killing nine × soldiers, and finally collapsed.

The fierce battle extended to 4:00 PM. There were no less than two hundred × corpses in front of our position. The × forces began to use artillery to assist the infantry attack again, and ten cannons fired wildly at the same time, shaking even the mountains. Camp Commander Cheng calculated that this was the × forces' last five minutes of struggle, and a purplish complexion shone on his oily black face. He stood up and shouted, "Brothers, are you afraid?"

There was then a burst of angry roars of "Not afraid!"

"Those who are not afraid, charge!" Camp Commander Cheng raised his … (To be continued)

### German and Italian Naval and Land Forces Concentrate in Spain, Britain and France Closely Monitor, Poland Protests German Aircraft Crossing Border

[Reuters, London, 17th] The Times' diplomatic correspondent says that the British government's transfer of troops stationed in Palestine to Egypt and the dispatch of the Welsh Guards to Gibraltar both indicate that Britain and France are paying close attention to the Mediterranean and Spain. Large quantities of German military equipment have been shipped to naval ports and airfields along the northwest coast of Spain. Britain has also tightened its scrutiny of reports of Italian military actions in Spain, especially regarding when the Italian army's victory parade into Madrid will be held. The date was originally set for April 20th, then changed to May 2nd, and now to May 15th. The British government is clearly not satisfied with these changes.

Rapid Efforts to Strengthen the Peace Front

[Associated Press, London, 17th] Britain is now taking major steps to bring the Soviet Union into the "anti-Hitler" group. France is also engaged in concluding a new agreement with the Soviet Union to provide automatic assistance in the event of a German invasion. The content of the new agreement will be that if France joins in resisting a German invasion, the Soviet Union will immediately provide assistance to Poland and Romania. Britain is also preparing to establish an air force agreement with the Soviet Union. However, the terms under which Britain and France will exchange for the Soviet Union's promise to assist Poland and Romania are not yet known. The new agreement will also stipulate that British and French military supplies for Poland and Romania will be transported through Soviet territory, via the Black Sea and the North Sea to Soviet ports. The Soviet ambassador to France has been instructed to begin negotiations with France, and the general staffs of both countries may hold joint discussions in the future. The British ambassador to the Soviet Union has also been instructed to hold discussions with the Moscow authorities.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 16th] People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov received British Ambassador Sir Seeds this afternoon and held a half-hour meeting. Officials from both Britain and the Soviet Union have refused to disclose the content of the meeting.

[Reuters, Paris, 16th] Negotiations on the "Peace Front" with the Soviet Union and Turkey have made satisfactory progress. Informed sources predict that methods of cooperation between democratic countries in Eastern and Western Europe can be quickly achieved, and it is reported that Turkey's responsibilities have been determined. However, the Soviet Union's scope of work is larger, and detailed discussions are still needed on how to assist Romania and Poland in resisting aggression. Negotiations on this aspect have not yet reached a decisive stage.

[Haitong Agency, London, 17th] According to today's London Daily Telegraph evening edition, Soviet Ambassador to London Maisky has now been recalled home to consult on various aspects of the current situation.

### U.S. President's Peace Proposal Unanimously Supported Nationwide; Soviet Union Prepared to Participate in Cooperation; Important U.S.-Soviet Talks to Be Held

[Reuters, London, 17th] The Washington correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" reports that President Roosevelt's courageous anti-aggression actions have garnered unanimous support nationwide. Although a minority believes that negotiating with dictators is futile and criticizes the President's adoption of an "appeasement policy," with some even criticizing the President for interfering in foreign affairs unrelated to the country, the unanimous tone of newspapers, the atmosphere in Congress, and especially the telegrams received by the White House, all demonstrate fervent support for the President's plan. What is particularly valuable is that even isolationists support the government. Senator Nye, one of the drafters of the neutrality law, stated that the government's actions at this time are a glorious move. The U.S. government is not discouraged by reports from Rome and Berlin. While they do not expect an immediate enthusiastic response from Germany and Italy, they believe that the dictators, recognizing the prevailing trend, will not shut all doors. The U.S. government believes that even if it ends in complete failure, its actions are entirely justified.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] The U.S. State Department may not receive replies from the German and Italian governments regarding President Roosevelt's telegram within the next few days. According to well-informed sources, we do not acknowledge that the President is advocating that democratic countries should trust totalitarian countries, or should again adopt a policy of appeasement. Last September, when the European situation was tense, the President anticipated that the relevant countries would convene a meeting for discussion, but unexpectedly, the result was only a four-power conference, which abandoned a sovereign and independent country (referring to Czechoslovakia), and that country had no representative present at the meeting. According to U.S. officials, the President is now advocating that relevant countries hold talks, including the United States. Informed sources here wish to pay attention to the term "talks." They believe that "talks" do not necessarily mean convening a meeting immediately, but will first involve an exchange of views among all parties, and the establishment of an expanded and dignified non-aggression guarantee by each country. If there is a violation of this guarantee, other countries may cease providing economic assistance to the violator. Authorities here state that if the Axis countries can consider world opinion, they will not reject President Roosevelt's request.

Kalinin Cables Congratulations to Roosevelt

[Reuters, Moscow, 16th] Today, Soviet newspapers published the full text of President Roosevelt's appeal to Mussolini and Hitler in a prominent position, without commentary. Political circles view the telegram as a practical and effective step towards maintaining world peace, and have clearly defined the aggressor countries, expressing their welcome. Although there are pessimistic views here regarding the future responses of Mussolini and Hitler, it is deeply believed that the Soviet Union will be prepared to participate in the international conference proposed by Roosevelt, and declares that the consistent policy of the Soviet Union is to mobilize all peace-loving countries to take collective action. The U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union will meet with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov today to continue the talks that began yesterday, but the content is still unknown. Kalinin, Chairman of the Soviet People's Commissariat, has sent a special telegram to Roosevelt congratulating him on his appeal to the dictators and expressing his gratitude. The telegram expresses the warm welcome of the entire Soviet people for the appeal and explains that the Soviet people are deeply concerned about the work of safeguarding world peace.

British Public Opinion Expresses Great Welcome

[Reuters, London, 16th] The British press has expressed great welcome for President Roosevelt's proposal, publishing it in newspapers with large headlines. Last night, hopes for this proposal were extremely high, but later, due to Germany's cold official attitude, hopes faded again. The importance of the U.S. fleet's deployment to the Pacific is second only to Roosevelt's proposal. "The Observer" commented in an article that in this century, Central Europe has launched two acts of provocation against freedom, and these acts all originate from the same source. However, Britain, separated from Europe by three thousand miles, does not easily let them go each time. "The Sunday Times" stated that people around the world are paying close attention to the future responses of Mussolini and Hitler, but if they do not have the determination to keep their promises, it would be better not to respond. "The Sunday Dispatch" stated that the President's proposal can be seen as a significant contribution by an individual to mankind in history. "The Sunday News" believes that totalitarian countries will reject Roosevelt's proposal, and the United States will further amend the neutrality law so that the victims of aggression can enjoy its benefits more. Garvin, the editor of "The Observer," recently published an article stating that the current situation is as perilous as it was last September. "If we can safely pass through the next few weeks, then we can obtain a long period of peace, but it is difficult to foresee what kind of events will occur in the next few weeks. The best way to prevent problems is still to make open preparations so that opportunists know there is a limit. We must also prepare to resist actions to occupy key points, whether in the East or in the West, whether by force or by other means."

[Reuters, London, 17th] The Times said today, "The most important question for the German and Italian people is whether they have the right to convey the intentions of themselves and the people of other countries to their rulers. Intelligent British policy has never rejected the opportunity for peaceful discussion; on the contrary, it has resolutely obtained this opportunity, and has recently moved forward step by step, and has arrived at a time when we can declare, like U.S. President Roosevelt, that we speak of peace not because we are afraid or weak." And the "Daily Mail" said, "President Roosevelt's call for peace may cause the dictators to suspend their actions temporarily, but it will not cause them to abandon force and politics. If we want to achieve this goal, there is no other way than the force of democratic countries."

Germany and Italy Confer but Remain Unrepentant

[Associated Press, Rome, 16th] According to authoritative sources here, Mussolini and General Göring, after conferring in Venice for an hour this evening, immediately drafted a reply rejecting Roosevelt's proposal to express the positions of Germany and Italy. Reliable sources said that during the day, Mussolini and Göring spoke with Hitler twice before finally deciding to reject Roosevelt's proposal. Italy's formal reply will be delivered to the U.S. government within three days. Political circles here believe that the replies from Germany and Italy,

### Romanian Foreign Minister to Visit Germany; Will Meet Beck While Passing Through Polish Territory to Discuss Mutual Assistance Issues

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 16th] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu is going to Germany for a visit and to offer congratulations to Hitler on his birthday. When he passes through the Polish city of Krakow tomorrow, Foreign Minister Beck will be there to greet him, so that they can discuss the extent of mutual assistance between Romania and Poland in the event of one or the other being attacked in the future, and consider the issue of unified military orders.

[Reuters, Rome, 16th] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu left for Berlin this evening for an official visit, scheduled to end on Wednesday. After that, before Gafencu continues to Belgium and Britain, he may stay in the German capital for a few days in a private capacity.

### Hungarian Prime Minister and Others Depart for Rome Yesterday

[Haitong Agency, Budapest, 17th] Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki, accompanied by Foreign Minister Csaky, set off for Rome this morning for an official visit to the Italian government. This trip by Hungarian political figures has been planned for a long time. Those traveling with them include Hungarian Ambassador to Rome Villani and several senior officials from the Hungarian Foreign Ministry.

[Haitong Agency, Budapest, 17th] According to a local evening newspaper, sources close to the Romanian government said that King Carol of Romania boarded the Romanian ship "Danube" today to go to a certain place to meet with Prince Paul, the Regent of Yugoslavia, to discuss international issues, especially those related to the Balkans, due to Italy's annexation of Albania.

### Saito's Ashes Arrive in Yokohama Yesterday

[Associated Press, Yokohama, 17th] The U.S. cruiser "Astoria," carrying the ashes of the late former U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Saito, arrived here at 8:00 this morning. Both the U.S. and Japanese ships fired salutes to pay tribute to the deceased envoy. The U.S. ship, escorted by three Japanese destroyers, sailed into the port, berthed at buoy No. 10, and lowered its flag to half-mast in mourning. Other ships berthed in the port also lowered their flags. The Japanese Emperor has sent a telegram to U.S. President Roosevelt expressing his gratitude. Japanese newspapers praised the move, saying, "The U.S. government's transport of the ashes of the late Ambassador Saito back to his country shows the greatest respect for a foreign diplomat." Although they are completely different, individual replies should be adopted.

[Associated Press, Rome, 10th] According to reports, Mussolini and Göring have now decided to take a firm stance on Roosevelt's proposal. Once both sides have thoroughly discussed it, they will present Roosevelt with a strongly worded reply. People here believe that Mussolini advised Hitler to give Roosevelt a reply for the sake of international procedures. It is generally believed that Mussolini informed the Italian King of his decision this morning after accepting the Albanian crown. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, Ciano discussed the encirclement of Germany by foreign countries with Göring. It is said that Göring paid close attention to Italy's air transportation. Ciano informed Göring in detail about the recent situation of Italy's air force transporting Italian troops to Albania.

[Reuters, Rome, 16th] The full text of President Roosevelt's telegram was published in today's newspapers, but none of them commented on it, and only reprinted news of the negative reaction from Berlin below the text. Considering the current situation, even those in moderate political circles who once tended to welcome the telegram yesterday now find it difficult to expect President Roosevelt's wishes to be fulfilled. The telegram is considered by some to be "poorly drafted, weak in judgment, and petty in attitude, which is truly laughable."

### Hitler Returns to Berlin Yesterday

[Reuters, Berlin, 17th] Hitler has scheduled a Reichstag meeting for the 28th of this month, at which time he will present his response to the U.S. President's telegram.

[Associated Press, Munich, 16th] Hitler returned to Berlin by special train at 9:00 this evening, and is expected to arrive tomorrow morning. Before Hitler left, he held talks with the Foreign Minister. People here believe that Hitler will not send a reply to Roosevelt before his birthday.

[Reuters, Berlin, 16th] The "Frankfurter Zeitung" wrote in an editorial tone, "Germany and Italy's work to revise the Treaty of Versailles has not yet come to an end. They will continue to use their own strength to achieve their goals." The "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" carried an article titled "Terror Against Germans in London," reporting on the mistreatment of Germans in Britain. [Associated Press, Berlin, 16th] The diplomatic mouthpiece "Diplomatische Korrespondenz" declared today that Germany will resolutely reject Roosevelt's proposal. The newspaper accused Roosevelt of supporting the encirclement policy of Britain and France, and said that the countries of Central Europe do not trust Roosevelt's telegram. As for when Hitler himself will reply to Roosevelt, it was not specified.

However, it is said that the King is very keen to realize this trip.

[Central News Agency, London, 17th] The British King and Queen, Prime Minister Chamberlain and his wife, U.S. Ambassador to Britain Kennedy and his wife, and other dignitaries traveled by car from Windsor Castle to Hooke Weave yesterday to inspect a balloon factory.

Currently, they have obtained permission from the military authorities to return to Albanian territory.

### U.S. Fleet Returns to Pacific; Japan Surprised; British Newspapers Say It Is a Planned Action; More Than 200 Ships Will Be Stationed

[Reuters, London, 17th] The Times correspondent in Washington, commenting on the movement of the fleet to the Pacific, said, "This movement of the fleet, as well as the import of tin and rubber into the United States, is clearly planned. This decision has made it impossible for the entire fleet to participate in the World's Fair in New York. After the fleet passes through the Panama Canal, about 270 of the 357 warships will be stationed in the Pacific."

[Reuters, Tokyo, 17th] Naval circles here are deeply surprised by U.S. Navy Secretary Swanson's order for the U.S. fleet to move from the Atlantic to the Pacific. They believe that U.S.-Japan relations have only recently improved, and that with the situation in Europe becoming increasingly tense, the U.S. fleet should remain in the Atlantic to prevent emergencies. The Ministry of the Navy has declined to comment.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 10th] The "Kokumin Shimbun" described President Roosevelt's telegram today as a "telegram war," saying that the world situation will not be affected by this telegram.

### Impressions of the Guannan Guerrilla Army (Part 2) (Continued from the 14th)

He is willing to contribute his own strength to build a new, independent and free China! Those brave soldiers he leads are equally admirable. They have left factories, classrooms, and farms, and bravely stepped onto the anti-Japanese battlefield. The hot blood they shed will irrigate a flower of freedom.

In addition to our love and support for these soldiers who defend the motherland, we would like to offer the following hopes from the standpoint of anti-Japanese comrades:

Chief Gao said: "The military discipline of the Guannan Guerrilla Army is precisely the art of war used by famous generals at home and abroad, and this valuable experience should be promoted and carried forward." However, we must further recognize that this war of resistance against Japan is different from other wars. Previous wars were mostly for the sake of the great achievements of one family or one person, and the purpose of the war was not dared to be told to the army and the people, so only strict laws and harsh punishments were used to force execution. This war is to drive the Japanese out of the country and establish a free and happy new China, and it is also for the liberation of the Japanese people and the masses and for world justice and peace. This bright and upright purpose of the war must not only be told to the anti-Japanese soldiers over and over again, but also be explained in detail to the backward masses, and even more, efforts must be made to carry out in-depth and extensive propaganda to the traitorous puppet troops. We cannot win by simply fighting with weapons against the Japanese today. Only by using this political war, internally, turning the officers, soldiers, and people into soldiers with a high degree of political awareness, so that officers and soldiers are united as one, and the military and civilians cooperate; and externally, disintegrating the soldiers of the puppet troops, so that they stand on the revolutionary front with us and work together, can we defeat the fierce Japanese! For example, regarding the phenomenon of desertion, as long as we do our political work well, they will not run away even if they are told to run, and even if there are occasional deserters, we can still use reason to persuade them. Therefore, in governing the army today, political work comes first, and strict laws and harsh punishments only play a supplementary role. In fact, only by doing political work well can military discipline be maintained. Chief Gao said: "We already have a political training department." This is a fortunate thing. We believe that under the leadership of Commander Du, a very good political work system will be established soon. Chief Gao also specifically mentioned that there have been misunderstandings with various parties in the past, and expressed his deep regret. We believe that in the war of resistance against Japan, "not only one must run fast, but everyone must keep up!" Because the work of resisting Japan is arduous. Only by mobilizing the efforts of the entire nation can we succeed. All officers and soldiers of the Guannan Guerrilla Army have a very strong anti-Japanese sentiment, and they can't wait to drive the Japanese away and immediately see the new China appear, so they have adopted a somewhat impatient attitude towards the masses, organizations, groups, and friendly forces in some places. However, historical habits are not easy to change, and social relations are even more complex. Everyone who does salvation work can only grasp the highest principle of "resistance to Japan is above all else, and everything is subordinate to resistance to Japan," and treat the masses, organizations, groups, and friendly forces with a polite and humble attitude, so that they can help each other, develop together, unite sincerely, reduce friction, and wholeheartedly deal with the common enemy - Japanese imperialism. Chief Gao said: "We already have a teaching department, and from now on we can contact all parties!" Yes, we believe that political work can overcome all difficulties.

Let these two paragraphs be my gift to the Guannan Guerrilla Army. In fact, these gifts have probably already become the tail of the facts, because all the officers and soldiers of the Guannan Guerrilla Army that we respect, under the leadership of Commander Du, have already been moving towards this goal.

A Short Comment

### Look at China!

The English-language "Hong Kong Telegraph" published an editorial yesterday entitled "Look at China," detailing the relationship between China and the European situation, and vigorously praising the recent counter-offensive power of our army. We believe that what should be noted is:

First, it proves the new recognition and trust of friendly countries in China's war of resistance forces. It points out that the international situation will increasingly tend towards a favorable future. It refutes the "peace" compromise and mediation arguments of a few, which are really not suitable for China today!

Second, it proves that the recent rumors spread by Japanese traitors that the British ambassadors to China and Japan are holding talks to resolve the war are groundless rumors. It also corrects the fact that the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, who is on his way to Chongqing, not only has no intention of "mediation," but will also help increase the friendly relations between China and Britain in response to the European situation. The international anti-aggression front is developing, and we must thoroughly smash the rumors and conspiracies of Japanese traitors for compromise and mediation!

Third, it further points out that in the past twenty months or so of China's war of resistance, it has created achievements that can be admired by the world, but China's great achievements are entirely based on its own efforts, and the foreign aid it has received is very weak. Therefore, it calls for if the democratic and peace-loving countries can give China more active support in the future, the Japanese aggressors will be unworthy of a fight. This is also a fact, and we must intensify our efforts to win greater and more sympathy and assistance from the democratic and peace-loving countries!

Look at China! It has grown stronger from the unprecedentedly difficult and bloody battles. It will no longer worry about the smokescreens of anti-communism and peace and the tricks of mediation from the Japanese and traitors - every Chinese who does not want to be a slave should strengthen their self-confidence and resolutely support united resistance!

### French Government Announces Wartime Measures; Is Recruiting Reserves; Plans to Evacuate Population of Paris

[Haitong Agency, Paris, 17th] France is gradually recruiting reserves into the army, and the teams are assembled very early in the morning. This move seems to contain some secrecy. The wartime measures taken by the French government have been announced in various newspapers, including the supply of gas masks and plans to evacuate the population of Paris. "Paris-Soir" reported that the authorities will issue leaflets informing people where they can obtain exit permits. The permit indicates the name of the railway station and the time of the train departure. The newspaper also stated that the evacuation order will be issued within 48 hours after mobilization. Special plans are also being made for the evacuation of groups of children in families and schools. Gas masks will be distributed after the sandbags are distributed. This has already been implemented in several places.

### Actively Strengthening Hong Kong's Air Force; Preliminary Expansion Plan to be Completed This Year; Anti-Aircraft Authorities to Establish Anti-Aircraft Station in Wan Chai; Change of Commanders for the Hong Kong Navy; Paddon to Succeed

The Hong Kong government has been actively strengthening Hong Kong's defenses in recent years. However, the expansion of the air force does not appear to be progressing rapidly. According to Western news sources, the British Air Ministry has adopted a proactive policy toward expanding the Hong Kong Air Force. However, due to the tense situation in Europe, the defense of the British mainland is of greater importance, which has led to delays in various colonies. Nevertheless, the British mainland's air force equipment will soon be fully completed. It is expected that the preliminary expansion plan for Hong Kong will be completed within this year, with several squadrons of first-line aircraft being transferred from Britain to Hong Kong. The second batch of aircraft will be supplied by Australia. As for Hong Kong's anti-aircraft artillery defenses, they have already reached a considerable level of strength. Furthermore, the Hong Kong anti-aircraft authorities have divided Hong Kong and Kowloon into 22 anti-aircraft zones, and experienced air defense personnel are teaching anti-aircraft knowledge to reduce the danger of enemy air raids. Classes are being conducted in each zone in turn. The Wan Chai District anti-aircraft training class also held its opening ceremony at the Dunmei School last night. Anti-Aircraft Bureau Chairman Pinli, Anti-Aircraft Commissioner Mr. Sparkin, Anti-Aircraft Committee Member Xie Jiabao, and others also personally provided guidance. According to Mr. Shi, the anti-aircraft authorities will establish an anti-aircraft station in the Wan Chai reclamation area so that residents living in Wan Chai can be protected in the event of war. Colonel Dickens, the British Naval Commander in Hong Kong and Commander of HMS Tamar, has recently been reassigned. The vacancy has been filled by the Naval Department with the appointment of Mr. Paddon, who will also serve as Superintendent of Naval Dockyards and Naval Construction. At the same time, the Naval Department specially appointed Lieutenant Reed of the training ship HMS Vindictive as Mr. Paddon's secretary. According to naval authorities, Britain has recently completed two shallow-water warships named HMS Dragonfly and HMS Firefly, both of which have been launched and placed under the command of the British Naval Commander in China. The two ships have already arrived from the Eastern Mediterranean. Each ship weighs 585 tons, slightly smaller than HMS Scorpion, the recently designated Yangtze River flagship after HMS Bee, but larger than the shallow-water warships built after the European war. There are currently two more ships under construction, with the same design as the aforementioned two ships, which began construction in England last year.

According to the notice issued by the Municipal Health Bureau some time ago, interviews with merchants bidding for stalls in the market were originally scheduled for 2:30 PM today (the 18th) to finalize the lease procedures.

Premature Interview with Some Merchants

However, according to a report in the "Hong Kong Daily Press" yesterday, their reporter learned that the Health Bureau suddenly interviewed a portion of merchants yesterday (the 17th) ahead of schedule. These merchants were the ones who had received prior notification from the Health Bureau. The circular stated: "Dear Sir/Madam, the bidding for some stalls in the Central Market is scheduled for 2:30 PM on April 17th. This bidding is limited to those with the following two qualifications: (1) those who previously leased stalls in the Central Market; (2) those currently operating in the South section of the Sheung Wan Market. Other merchants cannot bid today (the 17th). The above-mentioned bidding merchants must attend the Health Bureau in person. Those who win a stall must pay five or six months' rent in advance. The date of commencement of business will be announced publicly in May. This type of stall is only for retail sales; wholesale merchants cannot operate in the new market." The opening date announced in this circular contradicts the date announced by the authorities some time ago, which was 2:30 PM this afternoon. The reporter tried to investigate how many stalls remained today after the authorities interviewed the merchants yesterday, but had no clue. However, it is believed that those who bid early were only a portion of those who received preferential treatment and were seen first.

Most Merchants Feel Unfairly Treated

The merchants who were not interviewed by the authorities yesterday felt quite unfairly treated by the authorities' decision to conduct the interviews ahead of schedule. It is said that they are now appealing to the Governor, lodging a protest. This is because many of these merchants wanted to bid for the stalls in the Central Market, but they were never informed of the authorities' premature interview. The authorities never issued a notice of change of date beforehand; only a portion of merchants were notified. Some stallholders have engaged a barrister to submit a statement to the Municipal Health Bureau, questioning the reasons for the specially prioritized interviews. At the same time, fruit and vegetable vendors are also questioning whether the authorities' advanced date for the interviews applies only to chicken and duck stalls, and whether vegetable stalls would be similarly interviewed ahead of schedule. The authorities have not yet responded to this. Furthermore, a month ago, merchants intending to bid for the Central Market stalls submitted a statement to the health authorities, inquiring whether there would be any discrimination against bidding merchants when the market stalls were opened for bidding in the future. The authorities replied that there would be absolutely no distinction between them.

### Reservoir Water Increases After Days of Heavy Rain; Total Gain Exceeds Three Inches

Since the heavy rains last Saturday, the water level in Hong Kong's reservoirs has risen sharply, with a total rainfall of over three inches. The total rainfall this year is eight inches and nine cents and four mils, exceeding the normal record by two-thirds of a mil. However, to solve the water shortage, continued rainfall is necessary, as the rainfall in Hong Kong last year was too low. There was also light rain yesterday, which should have increased the water level in the reservoirs. According to the Hong Kong Observatory's forecast, Hong Kong will have easterly winds and light rain in the morning. The temperature in Hong Kong was not affected by the rainfall. The highest temperature yesterday was 75 degrees, and the lowest was 69 degrees. The humidity reached 90 percent. An anticyclone is spreading over North and Northeast China and Japan, its momentum is slow, and blowing south into East China. A low pressure area is in the Ryukyu Islands and Tokyo Bay.

### Siam Suddenly Increases Cigarette Tax; Sales of Chinese and British Cigarettes Hit; British Tobacco Merchants Planning Remedial Measures

The Siamese government recently imposed new taxes on imported cigarettes in order to reorganize its tax revenue and increase its financial resources. In addition to increasing the tax rate on imported cigarettes, it also issued stamp tax seals. All retail cigarettes in the market must obtain a seal before they can be sold, similar to the past tobacco tax measures in Guangdong. Otherwise, they will be punished for tax evasion. Since the promulgation of this new regulation, cigarette prices in Siam have increased, and the market has been in turmoil. However, in the Siamese cigarette market, the products of British-American Tobacco Company and Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company and other Chinese-funded tobacco companies occupy an important position. The annual sales of various cigarettes to Siam are huge, especially from the British side. Therefore, the Siamese government's promulgation of the new regulation increasing the cigarette tax rate has directly hit the sales of Chinese and British cigarettes, affecting business significantly. According to news from British tobacco merchants in Hong Kong, British tobacco merchants are paying close attention to this and are currently planning remedial measures, hoping to cope with this new environment to avoid any impact on the Siamese market. People in the British tobacco industry have reported to the government authorities and requested negotiations with Siam for improvement. The British Minister to Siam has had several contacts with the Siamese Minister of Finance, but the outcome is currently unknown.

### The World of Bandits; Armed Robbery Occurs Again in San Tin Village, Lok Ma Chau Yesterday; Five Robbers Break into House While People are Sound Asleep and Loot Everything; Total Stolen Cash and Jewelry Reaches Over $300

For months, the New Territories have become a world of bandits, with armed robberies occurring frequently. Although the police have been conducting special investigations, they have not been able to curb the trend. At 1:30 AM yesterday morning, in San Tin Village, Lok Ma Chau, New Territories, a widow named Chen Lian was robbed by five armed robbers who broke into her house and looted everything. The total stolen cash and jewelry reached over $300, amounting to daylight robbery. The following is a record of the investigation:

Sound Asleep Under Quilts; Five Robbers Break into House

A house without a door number in San Tin Village is inhabited by a widow named Chen Lian, 58 years old, along with two young daughters and two female relatives. Ms. Chen has quite a few savings, and her jewelry is dazzling, often catching people's attention. However, this attracted the attention of bandits, who suddenly launched an armed robbery. At 1:30 AM yesterday morning, Ms. Chen and her two daughters and two relatives were sound asleep. Ms. Chen was suddenly awakened by the creaking sound of the door, knowing that something must have happened. She quickly got up and woke up her two daughters and two relatives, lit a lamp, and shouted to ask who was there. Unexpectedly, before she finished speaking, the door collapsed with a loud crash, and five men in black clothes rushed in, each holding a pistol and a flashlight, shining them on Ms. Chen and her companions, threatening them not to make any noise, otherwise the bullets would be merciless. Ms. Chen and the other four women were all women, and seeing the fierce momentum of the robbers, they were forced to remain silent, huddled in a corner, and wept softly. One of the five robbers was covering his head with a white cloth, making it impossible to see his true face, which suggested he was an acquaintance.

Wanton Looting; Leaving Quietly

Seeing that no one in the house dared to resist, the five robbers calmly took out iron wires and rags they had brought with them from their pockets and tied the hands and feet of each person one by one, stuffed their mouths tightly, and pushed them onto the bed. Then they searched each person one by one, robbing them of all the cash and jewelry they had with them. They pushed each person back into bed, covered them tightly with quilts, and had one robber stand guard with a gun. The other four robbers then began to search, rummaging through boxes and cabinets, leaving no stone unturned. As it was deep at night, the neighbors were all asleep and did not realize that the robbers were searching the house. After more than an hour, the cash, jewelry, and clothing in the house had all been looted. Each person carried their loot separately and quietly left the house, disappearing without a trace.

Untied and Reported; Police Detectives Investigating Traces of Bandits

Before leaving, the robbers warned Ms. Chen and the others not to call the police, otherwise there would be consequences. Long after the robbers left, Ms. Chen and the others struggled with each other, untied themselves one after another, and then shouted loudly about the robbery and rushed to the Lok Ma Chau police station to report the crime. The officer on duty immediately dispatched Chinese and Indian police officers to search for traces of the bandits and telegraphed the police stations in various districts of the New Territories and Hong Kong to request assistance in the investigation. One party accompanied Chinese detectives to Ms. Chen's house to investigate everything. According to Ms. Chen, $34 in Hong Kong currency and $48 in small bills were stolen from her person. The gold rings, earrings, etc. of her two daughters and two relatives were all looted, and the gold and silver objects in the boxes and cabinets were also searched and emptied. The total loss this time was approximately HK$353.

The Hong Kong Fishermen's Association recently received donations from overseas Chinese in the Philippines to assist fishermen and built four fishing boats to support unemployed fishermen. The four new boats have now been completed and launched. According to the person in charge of the association yesterday morning, the association has scheduled a launching ceremony for the four boats at 12:00 noon on the 23rd of this month and has respectfully invited Ms. He Xiangning, a member of the Central Committee, to preside over everything. The location will be at the Xiangdao Theatre in Aberdeen, Hong Kong. The four boats were built with donations from overseas Chinese, so all figures are public. The names of the four boats are Spirit, Unity, Self-Reliance, and Renewal.

### National Bank Reduces Capital; Original Amount of HK$1 Million Reduced to Over $1.9 Million

The National Commercial Savings Bank specially retained lawyer Lo Man Kam and hired barrister Pott to apply to the High Court to reduce its capital of $5 million to $1,923,080. The value of the bank's preferred shares remained unchanged, while the ordinary shares were reduced from $10 per share to $1 per share. According to Mr. Pott, the plan had been unanimously approved by all creditors. The debt without collateral, which had been ordered by the court in 1936 to be repaid in installments over six months, will be extended for one year. The purpose of the new plan is to concentrate the bank's debts to facilitate business operations. The bank has now repaid the fourth installment, but all creditors have agreed to the extension of the debt repayment period.

### National Christian University Holds Educational Conference in Hong Kong; Conference Scheduled for One Week, Started Yesterday; All Twelve University Presidents Arrived in Hong Kong to Attend

The National Christian University Educational Conference is being held in Hong Kong. This conference will decide on future educational and administrative methods for Christian universities, and its nature is extremely important. University presidents and professors have arrived in Hong Kong one after another, including twelve schools: Yenching, St. John's, Soochow, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Union, Ginling Women's College, Lingnan, Qilu, Jinling, Ginling Women's College, and West China. The president of Huachung University was unable to attend due to urgent matters.

Conference for One Week; The conference began yesterday at the Bishop's House and will be held continuously for one week, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM each day. The conference will close on the weekend. Yesterday's and today's agenda items include reporting matters, with each university reporting in detail on their school affairs over the past year of the war. Discussion items will begin tomorrow. In addition to convening general meetings every day, separate groups will review various proposals in order to comprehensively present them for discussion.

Arduous Efforts; Since the war, all Christian universities across the country have been working hard in difficult circumstances, either because their campuses are in occupied areas or because they have been destroyed by bombing. For example, Yenching University in Beijing continues to operate in the occupied area. The four universities of St. John's, Soochow, Shanghai, and Hangzhou in Shanghai are jointly holding classes in mainland Shanghai. Jinling, Jinling Women's College, Qilu, and West China are also jointly operating at the campus of West China University in Chengdu. When reporters visited Dr. Miao Qiusheng yesterday, Dr. Miao said that the past and future educational policies of Christianity are based on two major principles: (1) the lives of faculty and students are protected, and (2) educational freedom. If these two principles can be preserved, then universities will continue to operate in difficult circumstances; otherwise, they would rather suspend operations. Dr. Miao gave a more practical and clear explanation of the second principle, saying that if education can be carried out in accordance with the educational policies set by the central government, then it will continue. Regardless of whether one is a Christian or not, it is gratifying that there have been no Christian students who have become traitors since the war.

### Chen Xilin Fails to Appeal in the Lin Bosheng Assassination Case; Original Sentence of Fifteen Years in Prison Upheld

Lin Bosheng, the manager of the Hong Kong Nanhua Daily, was previously shot at on Avenue Central. The suspect, Chen Xilin, was charged with two counts of attempted murder and assault. The case was heard by Judge McKinley in the High Court last month, and he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. Chen appealed to the High Court through lawyers Luo Shibi and Mai Nan Mana, requesting a reduction in the sentence. The case was heard yesterday morning at 10:30 AM by Judge Lian Su and Legal Secretary Chuanli Shayanzhi. Deputy Legal Secretary Bao Landisi and barrister Liao Yali Mata represented the government. The defendant's lawyer first stated the reasons for the appeal, saying that the injured person was hospitalized for only one month, which showed that the injuries were not serious. If the defendant had intended to commit murder, he would have seriously injured the plaintiff and then removed his hat while he was lying on the ground before shooting him in the head. The defendant did not do this at the time, and the testimonies of the witnesses were also exaggerated. Therefore, the original sentence of fifteen years in prison was too severe. He then cited legal precedents to elaborate on the reasons. After reviewing the case, Judge Lian stated that the testimonies of the witnesses proved the circumstances of the defendant's crime in great detail and that the defendant was guilty of (1) loitering in the road with malicious intent and (2) possessing a weapon. Therefore, the original sentence of fifteen years in prison was not excessive, and the appeal was dismissed.

The Hong Kong Government Strictly Prohibits New Territories Residents from Cutting Down Trees Without Authorization; Carrying Knives and Axes Prohibited When Climbing Mountains to Collect Dead Branches

Due to the impact on the source of firewood in Hong Kong, there has been a firewood shortage, which has hit the general residents hard. Those who run firewood businesses have certainly made huge profits. Due to the urgent demand, many men and women have abandoned other operations and climbed mountains to collect various dead branches or cut down trees privately to sell to residents. For months, countless men and women have been climbing mountains every morning since dawn through the mountain paths of Pok Fu Lam, Happy Valley, and Shau Kei Wan to collect firewood. The New Territories are even more active. For months, peninsula firewood merchants have been going to the New Territories to collect firewood and transport it to Hong Kong for sale. The recent use of multiple trucks transporting the firewood daily is a clear illustration of this. According to reliable information, the Forestry Bureau believes that the cultivation of forests in the New Territories is closely related to the prosperity of local agriculture and should not allow local residents to cut them down at will, causing serious damage to the forests in the New Territories and indirectly impacting local agricultural production. Yesterday, it issued a notice to police stations throughout the New Territories, ordering police officers to conscientiously crack down on local residents climbing mountains to cut down trees. Anyone climbing mountains to collect dead branches is strictly prohibited from carrying knives and axes and other sharp objects; otherwise, they will be arrested and severely punished in accordance with the law. On the other hand, prohibition notices were printed and posted on public walls in various villages and at the entrances to various mountain forests, advising the general public not to break the law. Therefore, the transport and sale of firewood from the New Territories to Hong Kong will be greatly reduced in the future, and the source of firewood in Hong Kong will be somewhat affected.

### Yesterday's Regular Meeting of the Various Circles Relief Association: Donating Rice to Aid Mainland Refugees, Allocating Aid to the Sze Yup and Heshan Two Overseas Chinese Groups: 370 Bags of Rice Distributed

Attendees included Liu Qingxuan, Lu Guomian, Zhu Shaohua, Zhou Xingchi, Lu Fulin, Pei Sheng, Ye Lanquan, Zhao Ruolan, and others. The meeting discussed the following matters: (1) A letter from Wang Wensheng requesting that 100 able-bodied individuals be selected from among the refugees to be taken to Guangxi for land reclamation. It was resolved that refugees in Hong Kong are uniformly sheltered by the Hong Kong government, and the request could not be granted. He was asked to recruit in the mainland. (2) A letter from the Zhongsheng Charitable Society requesting that the General Assembly inform the China Travelers Drama Troupe to reschedule their charity performance to avoid conflicting with the General Assembly's Huanghuagang charity performance to avoid impacting revenue. It was resolved that the War Relief Association would handle this matter with the Queen's Theatre. (3) A letter from the Heshan Chamber of Commerce requesting the allocation of 200 bags of rice and sacks from the General Assembly to aid refugees. It was resolved that the General Assembly had a total of 300 bags of rice in storage. After allocating 100 bags to the Sze Yup Chamber of Commerce as previously agreed, over 100 bags remained. It was decided to allocate 170 bags to the Heshan Chamber of Commerce and the remaining 28 bags to the Red Swastika Society. Additionally, the thousands of sacks stored by the General Assembly would be allocated, with 1,000 sacks each to the Heshan Chamber of Commerce and the Sze Yup Chamber of Commerce. (4) Regarding the issue of awarding commemorative badges to the volunteer staff of the Shenzhen Refugee Camp, it was resolved that each volunteer would receive a commemorative badge, and each station chief would receive a commemorative mirror frame. It was also proposed to request Xu Shiying, the long-term representative of the Central Accounting Association, to inscribe a mirror frame for Director Lin Peisheng. All the above proposals will be submitted to tomorrow's General Assembly for discussion and approval. The 44th General Assembly is scheduled to be held at 3:00 PM tomorrow at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce.

### Our Various Army Divisions Advancing Rapidly: Guangzhou Expected to Fall Soon: Gunfire Heard Within Guangzhou: Western River Forces Striving to Hold Firm

[Special Dispatch from Shameen, Guangzhou] Our Northeast and Northwest armies have been fiercely attacking Guangdong for days, making rapid progress. Since the recapture of Zengcheng, the military's morale has greatly increased. Fourth War Zone Commander Zhang Fakui personally went to the front lines to command in an effort to recapture Guangzhou in one fell swoop. The Northern Route military operations are led by 12th Group Army Commander-in-Chief Yu Hanmou, who personally led the army southward. After several days of fierce fighting, the [enemy] could not hold on and retreated in disarray. Our vanguard is now approaching Guangzhou, only a dozen miles from Guangdong, and gunfire was heard in the market on the 16th. The [enemy] in Guangzhou is being deployed to the front lines for reinforcements. The defense of the suburbs is the responsibility of the puppet army led by Li Heyi, and only a small number of military police and civil defense corps remain in the city to maintain order.

Eastern Front Situation

After the recapture of Rizeng, we immediately took advantage of the victory to press on towards the [enemy] in the Shiqilong and Shitan areas, resulting in another fierce battle with the [enemy], the most intense in months. Subsequently, our large reinforcements arrived and attacked the [enemy] on three sides. The [enemy] could not hold on and retreated in disarray towards Shilong, where we surrounded the [enemy]. This battle completely cut off the [enemy]'s lines of communication. We have now established contact with our forces in Huaxian and are launching a major counter-offensive towards Guangzhou.

Northern Front Situation

After our recapture of Xinjie, the [enemy]'s flanks were attacked by us, causing the front and rear to lose contact, and they retreated in disarray towards Jiangcun and Shijing. We then divided our forces into two routes: one advanced south along the Guangdong Road, directly towards Guotang and Jiangcun, approaching Guangzhou, and the other moved east from Xinjie, circling around to attack south. After a day and night of bloody fighting, the forces had completed a large encirclement of Guangzhou by the morning of the [16th]. The [enemy] forces were extremely panicked and transferred forces from the Western River back to fortify Guangdong in an attempt to make a final stand. The order within Guangzhou is extremely chaotic, and guerrillas are often found in various locations.

Western River Situation

After days of active deployment by our Western River forces led by Deng Longguang, and with the assistance of the Guizhou army moving east, military morale has been boosted. Recently, with the successive victories of our Northeastern and Northwestern armies' counter-offensive, we have taken advantage of the momentum to launch a fierce counter-offensive against the [enemy] forces. The fighting on the Ningyang, Jiangmen, and Fuo lines has been extremely intense. The fighting near Zhuang is particularly fierce, with a bloody battle lasting a day and night, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of [enemy] soldiers. As of the morning of the 16th, the fighting was still ongoing. The various heights around [blank] Tangxia have been captured by us, and the [enemy] has been subjected to significant threats. In the [blank], Hecun area, the [enemy] forces have suffered heavy casualties due to repeated attacks by our military and civilians and are in a state of being overwhelmed. Yesterday, they forcibly recruited civilians to help build fortifications in an attempt to defend to the death, so the war in the Sze Yup region has become calmer.

### Zengcheng-Guangzhou Area Battles Still Fierce: Our Vanguard Units Only Separated from the [Enemy] by a River: [Enemy] Forces from Shitan Rushed to Support Zengcheng and Were Heavily Attacked

[Express Dispatch from the Eastern River] After our Eastern River army recaptured Zengcheng on the 15th, in order to eliminate the remaining [enemy] forces, they immediately dispatched part of their vanguard to pursue the retreating [enemy] forces on the Zengcheng-Guangzhou and Zengcheng-Shitan highways. As a result, fierce battles broke out again with the [enemy] in the Zhucun area of the Guangzeng Highway. News was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Continued details of the military situation are as follows:

Battles on the Zengcheng-Guangzhou Highway Still Fierce

According to local military authorities, a telephone call received from the front line yesterday stated that our forces pursuing the remaining [enemy] forces on the Zengcheng-Guangzhou road had surrounded the [enemy] in Zhucun on the 15th. Subsequently, a large [enemy] air detachment arrived, and the [enemy] forces used the aircraft for cover, launching a counter-attack against our army. The two sides remained deadlocked all day. The outcome has not yet been decided. Furthermore, at around 5:00 AM on the 16th, approximately 400 [enemy] soldiers from Guangzhou, equipped with over ten steel cannons and several tanks, arrived from Guangzhou along the Guangzeng Highway to provide support. Upon receiving the report, our army took advantage of the [enemy]'s instability and concentrated its strength, launching a sudden attack on the [enemy] forces with swift tactics. The [enemy] was caught off guard by the counter-attack, and the formation was thrown into disarray. They stubbornly resisted and engaged in a bitter struggle with us. From the night of the 15th to the spring rain of the 16th, the sky was hazy, and the [enemy] aircraft could not operate extensively, so our army's operations were relatively smooth. However, the [enemy] continued to struggle bitterly. Therefore, the fierce battle continues, and they are still fighting in the Zhucun area. Our army is continuing to send reinforcements.

[Enemy] Forces from Shitan Rushing to Support and Suffering Heavy Losses

It was also found that on the same day, the [enemy] forces being pursued by us were in an extremely precarious situation at the time. The [enemy] forces in Shitan mobilized their entire force of over a thousand men, circling around the southwest of Zengcheng in an attempt to attack our army from both sides, to relieve the siege of the Zengcheng-Shitan and Guangzhou-Shitan routes. Upon receiving the report, our army secretly dispatched a certain unit to lie in ambush near Tingzigang, waiting in strict formation. After a while, the [enemy] indeed led with tanks, followed by over two hundred cavalry, covering a large number of [enemy] infantry, advancing rapidly. When the [enemy] approached, our army issued a command, attacked from all sides, and engaged in a fierce battle with the [enemy] forces. The [enemy] forces used tank cover and came on fiercely, but they ultimately could not break through our army's solid line of defense. After several hours of fierce fighting, the [enemy] forces were defeated. As a result of this fierce battle, both [enemy] and our casualties were heavy. Our main forces have now successively arrived in the Mou Mou area to block the [enemy] forces, preparing to inflict a heavy blow on the [enemy] if they invade.

Chi and Wang Set Deadline to Capture Shilong

Chi Zhongkuan and Zhai Rongji, commanders of the Southeast Coast responsible for the lower reaches of the Eastern River, and Wang Ruozhou, commander of the Fourth District Guerrilla Column, believed that our main forces had recaptured [blank] Guangdong and occupied a dominant position. The [enemy] forces in Dongguan were indeed fundamentally shaken. With further pressure, success could be achieved. As Shilong was the most prominent [blank] on the Eastern Line, making it difficult for the [enemy] forces to defend, they decided to advance from this route. On the 13th, they specifically ordered the teams from Shangxia Nanshan, Shanpaitou, and the Guangzhou-Kowloon Line to continue advancing, setting a deadline to capture Shilong. After receiving the order, our teams advanced in the rain. The vanguard units had reached the Shuinan and Wangwuzhou areas by the afternoon. It was found that the area was only separated from Shilong Town by a river, and the sounds could be heard. The [enemy]'s movements could be seen. The [enemy] forces entrenched in Shilong had destroyed all the bridges to prevent our crossing and counter-attack. At the same time, they used concentrated steel cannons to bombard our army's positions in an attempt to stubbornly resist. Gunfire could be heard in Zhangmutou, Tangtou, and Xiake.

Zhang Fakui Sends Telegram to Encourage Liang Baoren

It was also found that in order to contain our counter-offensive troops in Dongguan Shilong, the [enemy] had previously dispatched 300 infantry, divided into more than 20 electric boats and speedboats, to invade Shi'an. Liang Shiren, commander of the Fourth Detachment of the Fourth District Column Headquarters, led his troops to bravely counterattack, defeating the [enemy] forces and killing their commander, Major Yongtian, and over ten [enemy] officers and soldiers, securing Bao'an and eliminating the threats to the flank of our army. Their contribution was significant. Fourth War Zone Commander-in-Chief Zhang Fakui, upon receiving the report, believed that Liang's command was effective and highly commendable. Yesterday, he sent a telegram to encourage Liang, urging him to continue his efforts. It has been found that since the [enemy] invaded Bao'an and suffered a severe punishment, they have been dormant in Taiping in recent days, daring not to act rashly. Therefore, the defense of Bao'an is unusually peaceful, and the villagers in each district have mobilized to prepare to assist our army in the counter-offensive.

### Panyu Braves Bitterly Attack Traitors: Puppet County Magistrate Chen Temporarily Suffers Five or Six Knife Wounds: Overseas Chinese Township Head Dai Dies from Injuries

[Dispatch from Panyu] Since the fall of Panyu County, the [enemy] have instigated traitorous scum to organize puppet maintenance associations in various occupied areas, and pulled local tyrants like Li Mou to serve as puppet county magistrate, establishing a puppet county government, implementing its "appeasement policy" in an attempt to anesthetize the people of our various townships. However, recently, the people of these townships and nearby guerrilla teams have been extremely active, often launching attacks against the [enemy] troops, causing disorder in the various districts. The [enemy] side responsible for the county believes that the puppet county magistrate and the various puppets cannot maintain order. In addition to detaining and punishing some of the puppet maintenance association puppets, they have also decided to replace the puppet county magistrate. Upon hearing this news, the county's ugly mob attempted to compete for power and began fawning upon the [enemy] and lobbying the puppets of the puppet maintenance associations in various districts, recommending them to the [enemy]. Therefore, recently, the ugly mob of traitors have been running around lobbying in various directions, extremely busy. Chen Mou, the puppet township head of Shilou Township in District One of the county, set up a wife's residence at Zhongming School in the township at 6:00 PM on the 11th of this month, inviting the [enemy] in the county and the puppet leaders of various districts and townships. However, the young braves of the township learned of this and gathered more than twenty people, sneaking into the Dajingtou Street area near the school, waiting until late at night, around 9:00 PM. When the ugly mob dispersed from the banquet, they drunkenly left the school. When they reached Dajingtou, the young people lying in ambush there, taking them by surprise, raised their knives and wildly slashed at Chen, the traitor. With the fall of the knives, Chen, the traitor, was seriously injured. The puppets who were traveling with him fled in panic and were surrounded and beaten severely by the youth lying in ambush in Lizhiwei. The puppets shouted for help, but no one responded. Then, the young people, their goals achieved, left calmly. It was later heard that those who were injured included Chen, the traitor, who was severely injured by five or six knife wounds on his hands and feet, and five or six puppets who were severely beaten, including Dai Mou, the puppet township head of nearby Chishan Township, [blank] who died from his injuries. Since this incident, the traitors there have been extremely frightened, like frightened birds, not daring to go out at night, and begging the [enemy] to send more [enemy] troops for protection. The situation is truly pitiful and laughable.

### Li Hanhun Focuses on the People: Sends Personnel to Tour Guerrilla Areas: Promulgates Six Instructions to Strictly Prevent Malpractice: Shexun Team Reorganized into National Self-Defense Force

[Express Dispatch from Shaoguan] During this second phase of the War of Resistance to win the initiative, Li Hanhun, chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government and commander of the Military Control District, pays close attention to the armed people, especially to the value of military-civilian cooperation in the counter-offensive military operations. Therefore, he decided to reorganize the guerrilla teams in Guangdong. After sending personnel to various districts to supervise, he also reorganized the Shexun Team to increase its strength in order to win victory.

Inspectors on Tour Li has issued an order to the inspectors in various districts to provide on-site guidance and has sent Su Yuquan, Wu Junsheng, Yu Zuming, Xu Junyan, Liu An, Shen Ziqing, Peng Jiyi, Ma Dasan, Yang Guojun, and others to inspect the strength of the various teams and assist local officials in organizing and training.

Six Instructions After the inspectors received their orders, they traveled to various districts to quickly reach work in each district. Before the inspectors departed, Chairman Li issued six instructions: 1. Strictly investigate those who embezzle funds, seek personal gain, or hinder national and provincial tax revenues. 2. Strictly investigate those who use force to protect gambling dens. 3. Strictly investigate those who falsely report numbers and embezzle military funds. 4. Strictly investigate those who do not distribute funds as required. 5. Strictly investigate those who resist conscription by enlisting in the Self-Defense Corps. 6. Strictly investigate those who rely on power to act recklessly and domineeringly. They are also instructed to report the situation of the Self-Defense Corps in the subordinate counties and cities at any time for evaluation.

Reorganizing the Shexun Team Chairman Li has also decided to reorganize the Shexun Team throughout the province to eliminate malpractice and achieve practical results. He specifically ordered the Shexun Teams in various places to be reorganized into the Military Training Department of the National Self-Defense Corps upon receiving the order. Yesterday, a telegram was sent to various places to comply, stating: Order to reorganize the Shexun General Team into the National Self-Defense General Team in accordance with the wartime national military training program. As for the implementation methods, they will be issued separately.

### Investigation of Losses from the Bombing of Liancheng: Total of Seventeen Bombs Dropped: Many Civilian Houses Destroyed

[Dispatch from the Southern Route] Recently, air raid alerts have been frequent here. [Enemy] aircraft often fly in groups over the airspace to attack Yunnan and Guizhou provinces. At around 8:00 AM on the 9th, the air defense command issued another alert. Eight [enemy] aircraft took off from the Weizhou area, flying in batches to San Niang Wan, Qianli, and other places for reconnaissance. At 10:20 AM, they entered the airspace of Liancheng City and dropped bombs. Our air defense forces immediately opened fire to shoot up, and the [enemy] aircraft also opened machine guns to return fire. A total of seventeen bombs were dropped. Because the county residents had taken shelter in advance, there were fortunately no casualties. The locations and losses from the bombing are as follows: A total of two bombs were dropped on Qinzhoutou Xiang Street, outside the city. One hit the open space next to Zhenxing Society on the left, and one hit the left side of the Zhong Family Shrine. Only two chickens were killed, and there were no other losses. The fourth bombing of Dabei [blank] Street resulted in a total of three bombs dropped. One bomb hit Deng Residence at No. 7 and Li Residence at No. 9, and the two residences were destroyed. Wu Residence at No. 7 was also affected and collapsed. One bomb hit the open space in the backyard of Jiang Residence at No. 18, destroying several sections of the surrounding wall. One bomb also hit the rear of the Zhuyuan area, destroying two houses. The Zhongshan Road County Fourth Elementary School teaching building was hit by one bomb, completely destroying the school office and reception room. Several nearby houses were also destroyed. The German Dehua Elementary School was attacked again, with one bomb hitting the playground and destroying the surrounding wall, affecting a young girl. One bomb hit the open space in Zhongshan Park, causing no losses. One bomb hit the side of Kuang Residence at No. 23, Xiasha Street, outside the city, completely destroying the main building and destroying the rear building.

### Shantou Evacuates the Elderly, Weak, Women, and Children: Evacuation to Be Completed by the End of the Month: Boat and Train Fares Are Half Price

[Dispatch from Shantou] In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, the authorities are determined to implement the evacuation of the population and the relocation of materials. The municipalities of Shantou and Chao'an have decided on specific evacuation measures. To expedite matters, the families of public officials have been evacuated in advance. Yesterday, Hua Zhenzhong, commander of the Chao-Shan Garrison, issued an order to the two municipalities to step up the promotion of evacuation: 1. Women, children, the elderly, the weak, and the unemployed are required to be evacuated by the end of this month. 2. All factories and schools must be relocated by the 12th of next month. 3. People who fail to evacuate by the deadline will be drafted into wartime units to assist in the task of the War of Resistance and will not be allowed to move freely. 4. If factories fail to evacuate by the deadline, all machinery will be moved and managed by the government. 5. Starting from the 16th, all boat and bus companies operating from the city to designated evacuation areas will offer half-price fares, but fares from the mainland to Shantou will be increased by 50% (e.g., a boat or bus fare from Shantou to Location A is one yuan, reduced to five mao; from Location A to Shantou is increased to one yuan and five mao). The families of the employees of the Chao-Shan Railway have also begun to evacuate.

### The Lessons of the Fall of Jiangmen (Continued)

— Yu Yun

The poor organization of the political workers themselves led to their retreat in the face of battle. As for the other public officials, they also had the same problems. A few days after the war, several district chiefs were found to have fled. The corruption of the political institutions had long been revealed to us. We can cite an example. If we are not forgetful, we will remember the news in the Hong Kong newspapers about the "Detention of Electric Boat Carrying Comfort Goods." Because in addition to the comfort goods, there were also many other goods such as cloth, sugar, and noodles, which no one claimed and were suspected of being smuggled. I think, at least, public officials were also engaging in "seeking small profits." What time did they have to mobilize the people? Secondly, we know the situation of conscription in various villages. Of course, many people were hired to replace them, but the [blank] department in charge of conscription made many difficulties when checking the qualifications of the drafted men. If "money was used to replace people," there was "no doubt."

The lack of political mobilization in Xinhui also had other reasons. Everyone knows that when Guangzhou fell, perhaps because of military expenditure problems, a trick of gambling was carried out, taxes were intercepted, and 200,000 anti-war fees were collected. Later, it was gradually banned by the wise authorities. But unfortunately, when it gradually entered the "good state," the [enemy] had already entered the hall.

The author unwittingly said a lot about the dark side of Xinhui. But Xinhui is, after all, a rich area. In the past, to prevent bandits, many civilian guns were purchased, and the people were brave. If the organization of the militia was strict, it could exert great power. In this counter-offensive victory, we hope that the authorities will quickly improve Xinhui's political mobilization and defend the key to the West Southern Road - Jiangmen.

### Movies Are Also Drama: Guo Pei'er's Leisurely Mood: German Propaganda Minister Promotes Himself: Decided to Produce a Film This Year

German Propaganda Minister Guo Pei'er has decided to personally produce a film this year. The script has also been drafted, and the tentative title is "Powerful Peace Lovers." The content will, of course, exaggerate the efforts of the German people for peace and will also try to portray the Jews as an extremely greedy and despicable nation. There are two main characters in the script, both of whom are lame. One is a pure Aryan who became a wealthy man because of his lameness, while the other, of Jewish descent, became a beggar because of his lameness. Some say, "This is Guo Pei'er's self-promotional film," because Guo Pei'er himself is a lame person of pure Aryan descent.

### Talking to Movie Stars by Telephone — As Difficult as Ascending to Heaven —

Hollywood is a city full of "wrong telephone numbers."

To get through to a movie star's home is harder than a camel passing through the eye of a needle.

It is not very difficult to make a phone call to the President of the United States and get an answer. At least, even if the President does not answer himself, you can get a written reply. But it is extremely difficult to make a phone call to Joan Blondell. Not only does she often move, she also constantly [blank] her phone number, and she is at home very, very little.

Years ago, a decent young man did not have a fixed occupation, but his life was very comfortable. His only method was to bet with people that he could telephone the German Emperor living in Holland. He did make one or two calls, but if he were asked to call Errol Flynn, it would stump him. Errol Flynn's phone number is kept secret even from his manager and closest friends.

You can tell the telephone operator that you want to talk to the American oil tycoon, and you may be able to get a reply, but the same operator will simply tell you that she cannot connect you to James Cagney because, "This subscriber has instructed us not to disclose his number."

Movie stars only use the telephone to talk to their managers. Managers get a special reward for not telling people the phone numbers of the stars they represent. A few years ago, Win Morris was only a waiter on an Australian ship. It was easier to call him when the ship was four thousand miles from the coast than it is to call him in Hollywood now.

Someone who is familiar with the situation in Hollywood can call the restaurant where a certain star is if he knows that the star is in that restaurant and ask that the star come to the phone. Most stars will not refuse.

Only when their contract is about to expire will movie stars let others know their phone numbers, but once they have signed a two-year, five-year, or seven-year contract, they will feel that the phone will only bring them misfortune, and they would rather not use the phone.

### Movie City Tidbits

Li Yuan, originally cast as the lead in "Pearl Shirt," was temporarily replaced by Mr. Jun due to a scheduling conflict. Therefore, Xinhua has now assigned him to co-star with Jin Yan in "Snowy Night Revenge."

Following "Wu Zetian," Fang Peilin plans to direct a children's film, likely influenced by "Orphan's Paradise."

The young star Mu Ling plays Lu Ming's childhood in the new film "Mysterious Lady."

Yuan Meiyun recently appeared before Wang Yin with a combative attitude.

Elder Sister Yin Qiu, since marrying Xiao Wang, already has two copies, one male and one female.

Zhou Xuan and Yan Fei, aunt and niece, have been very close recently.

Han Langan, because his black license plate car was being repaired, took a public bus on Avenue Joffre yesterday and suddenly encountered a pickpocket. Langan was quick-eyed and quick-handed, grabbing him immediately. The pickpocket hurriedly begged, "Mr. Han, please forgive me!" It turned out the pickpocket recognized this slapstick star. As for the "endangered" wallet, it contained nothing but an identity card. Mr. Han told me, "As for money, I hide it elsewhere."

Paramount's new film, "Prison in Hiding," is based on the latest work by J. Edgar Hoover, director of the Washington Detective Bureau. This is the first time the detective bureau director's "G-Man" type of work has been brought to the screen.

Anyone who has seen "Fishing Boat Bloodshed" will have noticed the sea dog, Sleek, who played the friend of Dolores del Rio and George Raft.

In "Gold Rush Fishing Song," Sleek also plays an important role. Unexpectedly, during filming on the San Francisco waterfront, Sleek imitated Gandhi and went on a hunger strike. This worried his owner, Mr. Winsten, who, recalling how he loved to eat when filming "North Sea Fishing Light," quickly sent a telegram to a fish market on the Columbia River to have fresh fish flown in. Only then did Sleek happily resume filming.

The life of Constance Bennett, the "Flirtatious Female Ghost," can be divided into three parts: movies, cosmetics manufacturing, and household management. In addition to acting in films, it is said that most of the cosmetics she uses are manufactured by herself. In Holmby Hills, she likes to personally handle all matters, big or small, and she manages everything in an orderly manner.

Harry stared at her in astonishment, "Where did you learn those codes?"

"Ah, I wasn't born dancing either. I attended the University of Vienna and… I worked with Mr. Freud and Mr. Joss. They were all famous teachers."

"From the University of Vienna to this Omaha Idol!" Harry whistled, "That's quite a leap!"

"Mr. Van, this is my whole life," she said solemnly, "Today, on the top of a mountain, tomorrow, perhaps in the Dead Sea."

"Okay, I guess you're right, little darling. But you still haven't explained why you want to help Shirleyka."

"I did that just because... because I accidentally became a little interested in you. I... I think you have an outstanding mind."

Harry, already very agile, avoided her gaze, changed his clothes, and after hearing her say such words, curiously glanced at her. "So, you observed that, did you?"

"Yes," she nodded seriously, "I also have an outstanding mind."

"And an outstanding way of speaking," Harry said mockingly, "Because a girl hangs all the turbulence of her life on her teeth."

"I was born a seeker of excitement," she said thoughtfully. "I have already experienced many surprises and dangers. Before my death, I will encounter even more such things."

"So, you're all prepared," Harry shook his head, "Well, are you planning to have dinner?"

### South China and Navy Championship Battle Changed to the 22nd Asahi Cup Third Game Held After the Inter-Port Team Returns to Hong Kong The Runner-Up of the Second Division League to be Decided Tomorrow in Kowloon

(Our Special Correspondent) The 1938-39 football season is coming to an end. Of the six major championships, the remaining unresolved items are the First Division League and the Asahi Cup.

The last game of the league is South China vs. Navy. Since the scores of these two teams are higher than all others, and the difference is only one point, this last game is equivalent to the final.

In order to end the season early, the game was originally scheduled to be held at the Navy field last Saturday, but the heavy rain on that day caused the field to be flooded and unusable, so the game was postponed.

Yesterday afternoon at about 5 o'clock, the members of the General Association Management Committee held a meeting to discuss the rescheduled date for the South China vs. Navy game. It was decided to hold the game at the Navy field at 4:30 pm on the 22nd of this month (Saturday).

The third game of the Asahi Cup, South China vs. Navy, was originally scheduled to be held on the 22nd. However, since the South China vs. Navy game has been changed to that day for the league championship battle, the Asahi Cup game has to be postponed and will be held after the inter-port team returns to Hong Kong. However, the date has not been set, probably in early May.

The exhibition match between the First Division League champion team and the inter-port team to the Philippines is scheduled to be held at the South China field in Caroline Hill at 4:30 pm on the 23rd (Sunday). If South China wins the championship, its players who are selected as representatives of the inter-port team will still play for South China. At 3:00 pm on the same afternoon, there will be an additional exhibition match between the Second Division League champion South China team and the Allied team at the same location. After the next game is over, the award ceremony will be held immediately.

The Asahi Cup is jointly organized by South China, Navy, and the Garrison Club, so the third game can be postponed until early May without conflicting with the closing date set by the General Association.

The runner-up of the Second Division League has not yet been decided, because the scores of Middlesex and the Fifth Battalion are equal, and a final must be held to determine the ownership. It is heard that it has been decided to hold the game at 4:00 pm tomorrow (Wednesday) at the Kowloon venue.

The General Association responded to the request of the Philippine side to send referee O'Ma with the inter-port team to the Philippines. It is found that O'Ma himself is also going to the Philippines for business and will leave first this Thursday. (The Football Field Authority)

### Last Night's Basketball Game, Star Island Defeats South China, South China Brothers Both Beat Police

In the open men's basketball game last night, the First Division South China fought Star Island. Both teams are strong teams in this competition and are ambitious for the championship, so at this crucial moment of decisive victory, they both came to the battle with elite troops. The battle was fierce, unprecedented since the start of the competition. Star Island was strong and powerful and adopted a wheel-style strategy. After a hard fight, South China was repeatedly broken and lost with a score of 21 to 35.

Star Island's Dai Fucheng used his skills freely and repeatedly made miraculous achievements. Pan Yaojun's sneak attacks under the basket were ingenious. Liang Guoxian was brave and commendable. Li Peiyan and Li Shijie were both able to coordinate before and after. However, Zhong Zhiqiang's progress was slightly slow and no good work was seen.

Although South China's Huang Zhaode was brave, he was closely monitored by Star Island. It was difficult for one palm to clap. Chen Zanen and Chen Zanfu repeatedly advanced and retreated. Although Li Xiao and Zhong Ling were able to respond thoughtfully, Star Island's defense and offense were consistent, so it was difficult to avoid defeat. After Huang Zhaode was fouled out, he was even more surrounded. In general, the failure of South China was also due to insufficient strength.

After the two sides engaged in battle, Chen Zanen scored a penalty shot. Xin Yalang, Dai Fucheng, and Pan Yaojun were unwilling to show weakness and launched an offensive, winning repeatedly. South China's counterattack was also successful, and the score was tied at 8 to 8.

Seeing that the flames of war were spreading, Star Island invited Zhong Zhiqiang and Lu Zhenxuan to join the army. The military power was greatly enhanced. Li Peiyan and Pan Yaojun frequently launched cold arrows. Chen Zanfu and Zhong Xian also tried hard to catch up, but in the end, in the first half, South China lost by two points, 16 to 15.

Changing places to fight again, Liang Guozheng joined the battle, with a turbulent momentum. Dai Fucheng and Xin Yajun were seen advancing on two routes and scoring shots. At the same time, South China's Chen Zanfu and Huang Zhaode also broke through and made achievements under the basket. However, Star Island mobilized all its forces and the offensive was in full swing. Liang Guoxian and Dai Fucheng made a comeback and scored again. At this time, the score was 27 to 21, which was very tense.

South China's counter-attack gradually turned around, but Star Island again transferred the new force Li Shijie to the field. In addition, South China's Huang Zhaode was fouled out and the formation shook again, falling into a situation of being surrounded on all sides. At the end of the game, they lost with a score of 21 to 35.

In the next First Division game, South China fought the police. Both sides fought fiercely. The police took the lead bravely, and South China coordinated well. Shi Zhenzhi and Shi Zhenda shot with 100% accuracy and were invincible. Chen Xinquan shot from near and far, and his hands were like spring. Qian Jinghui, Zheng Yukun, and Jie Min advanced and defended, threatening the police fiercely.

The police officer Na Lianxing was extraordinarily brave, shooting from afar and capturing from near, with frequent reports of victory. Chen Jinkui also repeatedly made good works. Zeng Tingkai was monitored by the other side and could not make progress. Ba Baoxing guarded well and was able to fulfill his responsibilities. However, South China coordinated the entire army well and shot accurately. After a brave battle, the police lost with a score of 32 to 42.

### France Selects Ten Best Tennis Players Betara Ranked First

The French Lawn Tennis Association recently selected Betara as the best tennis player in France. The reason for Betara's acquisition of the old position of Puseys is that he has achieved excellent results in the Taiwan Cup, British, and American competitions recently. Puseys is ranked second, but is still above Stymers, who is on par with Betara. The remaining seven of the ten best players are fourth, Brill, fifth, Fleire, sixth, Bilisha, seventh, Generno, and tenth, Geld Smith. British female athletes for next year's World Games

### British Female Athletes Focus on Appearance Selections to be Held Mid Next Month

### Yesterday's Tennis Match Postponed Due to Rain

Today's public lawn tennis match between Da Linzhen and Lin Tiande, originally scheduled for singles between He Jialiu and Xu Runpei yesterday, was postponed due to continuous rain and accumulated water on the court, making it difficult to play. If there is no rain today, there will be another singles match between Da Linzhen and Lin Tiande. Although Da Linzhen is not as brave as he was in his youth, he is very experienced and especially good at close combat. Lin is young and strong, and his volley is his forte. It is unpredictable who will win today's contest.

### Hong Kong-Macau Port Team Football Match Hong Kong Team Wins 2-0 Over Macau Team

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The 12th Hong Kong-Macau Port Team Football Match, held in Macau, saw a group of twelve players from Hong Kong take an early boat to Macau on the 15th. They arrived at noon and officially clashed with the Macau team at the dog racing track at 3 pm. There was a large crowd of about three to four thousand spectators. The two teams also fought fiercely.

After the start of the game, the two sides attacked and defended each other, the situation was tense, and there were many exciting moments. However, the Hong Kong team was a notch higher and often created scoring opportunities, but many shots hit the post and bounced out. The ball luck was particularly bad. Later, Ho Sik finally scored a goal and finished the first half.

Changing sides to fight, one side wanted to maintain the victory, and the other side wanted to reverse the defeat. Everyone had their own thoughts, and the battle became even more spectacular. After all, the Hong Kong team was stronger, and Shang Sik made another contribution. As a result, the Hong Kong team won with a score of 2-0. Goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai's performance was excellent.

In the previous two games, the Macau team won. However, in those two games, the Hong Kong team was represented by Second Division players. This year, at the request of the Macau side, First Division players were selected to go, so they won and returned.

Several players, including the regular starters Dehui, Zhuo Shijin, and Baijia, were unable to travel temporarily due to personal reasons. Holland Shih Hao was selected to supplement the team, and the team was able to win. As for Chen Guangyu, the inner guard of the Police Association, the team leader wanted to invite him to play because he had arrived in Macau in advance, but in the end, it was not possible, and Li Anna, who was traveling with the army, was still used as the right inner guard. The formations of the two sides during the war were as follows:

### Under Special Circumstances Customs Administration Destroyed Those with Difficulties in Implementation Should Reply According to Reason Export Tax Rates Should Be Handled in Accordance with Government Regulations

(Shanghai Dispatch) Luo Fu, the Customs Commissioner of the Shanghai Jianghai Customs, was forced by the environment to change the import tax rates under these special circumstances. As for the export tax exemption exceeding the collection tax, it is due to the government's encouragement of the export of domestic goods exempt from tax. The details are as follows:

Shanghai Customs Tax Exemption Exceeds Tax Collection

Jianghai Customs' export tax collection in August 1938 was 6,300,620 yuan, tax exemption was 14,894,263 yuan. In September, tax collection was 9,474,771 yuan, tax exemption was 18,145,985 yuan. In October, tax collection was 8,241,598 yuan, tax exemption was 14,660,309 yuan. In November, tax collection was 10,026,600 yuan, tax exemption was 20,193,813 yuan. In December, tax collection was 10,435,115 yuan, tax exemption was 17,514,399 yuan. In January 1939, tax collection was 11,384,241 yuan, tax exemption was 19,422,184 yuan. In February, tax collection was 10,531,048 yuan, tax exemption was 18,641,536 yuan.

Measures Under Special Circumstances

A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with the Customs yesterday and learned that after the National Army withdrew from Shanghai, the tax revenue of the Shanghai Customs was intercepted and changed to be held by the Japanese-owned Zhengjin Bank. Japanese customs officers were added, the flag was forcibly changed, and import tax rates were reduced. In name, it is still a Chinese customs, subordinate to the General Tax Administration, but in reality, the customs administration has been destroyed. Regarding the export of native goods, the settlement of foreign exchange, and the investigation and prohibition of goods supporting Japan, the General Tax Commissioner Mei Lehe, after receiving orders from the Ministry of Finance, ordered the Shanghai Customs to comply. Because Customs Commissioner Luo believed that there were difficulties in reality, he replied that he could not comply with the process. It is heard that he has obtained the understanding of the General Affairs Department.

Encouraging Tax-Free Export of Domestic Goods

The value of export goods from various customs in our country, the tax collection is more than the tax exemption, but the Shanghai Customs is the opposite. The outside world does not know the truth. But in fact, the export tax of Jianghai Customs has not been changed after the war. The tax rates are handled in accordance with the government's regulations. Because Shanghai has always been the center of industry and commerce in the country, there are many domestic goods processing factories. It is now a place where domestic goods are concentrated for export. Now the government encourages the export of machine-made domestic goods and major native goods, and all orders are allowed to be exported tax-free, so the export goods of Jianghai Customs, tax exemption exceeds tax collection. Among them, 70-80% of the tax-free goods are machine-made domestic products.

### Wartime Currency Situation in Fujian Province: Circulation Volume of National and Provincial Banknotes

(Yongan Correspondent) Fujian Province has long been connected with overseas regions, but its commerce has not yet been modernized. Most of the currency is hoarded, and the velocity of cash circulation is far behind that of Western countries, and even inferior compared to the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately investigate the amount of currency in circulation. However, since the central government issued a general order in November of the 24th year to implement the new currency system, thanks to the efforts of the provincial authorities, the amount of banknotes in circulation has greatly increased. After January of the 25th year, the amount of banknotes issued by various banks in Fujian Province also saw a sharp increase. Taking the Central Bank as an example, the monthly amount often reached around 12 million, breaking the record for the highest amount of banknotes issued in Fujian Province.

In August of the 26th year, the Shanghai Battle broke out, and the whole country fell into a state of war. The demand for currency in Fujian's market was unusually urgent. The monthly issuance amount of the Central Bank once exceeded 13 million. Although it soon stabilized, it was still enough to indicate the wartime commercial situation in Fujian Province and the consolidation of the legal tender's credit among the people. In addition to the Central Bank, there were also the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Joint Savings Bank, which were designated by the government as national banks. Their issuance amounts have increased since July of the 24th year. As of August of last year, the Bank of China had increased from 741,000 yuan to 53,083,000 yuan, the Bank of Communications had increased from 309,000 yuan to 2,487,000 yuan, and the Farmers Bank of China had increased from 222,000 yuan to 2,743,000 yuan. Among these four national banks, the Central Bank had the largest amount of banknotes issued, followed by the Bank of China, then the Farmers Bank of China, and finally the Bank of Communications. Since the implementation of the new currency system, the China Industrial Bank, because it was not designated by the government as a national bank, gradually withdrew the banknotes circulating in the market. By March of the 26th year, there were only 33,000 yuan in the entire province. However, since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the market lacked currency, and as a temporary measure, the issuance of banknotes was still allowed. The bank's issuance amount increased to 63,000 yuan, but compared to the past, it was less than one-third. The face value of the banknotes of these five banks, except for the Central Bank and the Farmers Bank of China which occasionally had subsidiary currency notes, the lowest was one yuan, which was convenient for large transactions, but small transactions were greatly inconvenienced. This shortcoming needs to be remedied by local banks. (To be continued)

### British Sports Tax Reaches One Million Pounds Annually

[London Correspondent] The British Treasury receives as much as one million pounds annually in tax revenue from sports. If a player is transferred from one club to another, the Treasury receives another payment. In this way, the entertainment tax on sports amounts to one million pounds annually.

Take Jones as an example. When he was transferred from Wolverhampton Wanderers to Arsenal, the transfer fee was 14,000 pounds. However, Wolverhampton Wanderers is a thriving club, and whether they sell Jones or not, they make money. They sold Jones and gained an extra 14,000 pounds. However, even so, Wolverhampton Wanderers did not actually receive 14,000 pounds in benefits. Out of these 10,000-plus pounds, they only received 14 shillings and sixpence per pound. That is to say, out of these 14,000 pounds, 4,000 pounds went into the tax collector's safe.

However, strangely, although the Treasury receives 4,000 pounds from the transfer of Jones, sometimes a struggling Third Division team, when selling a player even better than Jones for 15,000 pounds, may not receive a single penny, because the sale of a loss-making club is not taxable. In this way, when they sell a player for 10,000 pounds, they actually receive 10,000 pounds. However, a club cannot put all the money it makes this season into improving the stadium and report that the money has been used up and no profit has been made, because only expenses for maintaining the current state are considered legal. If you put the profit into improving the stadium, the tax collector will not recognize that you have not made a profit. At this time, the income tax from selling players will still have to be earned from your own pocket.

Therefore, you must not understand what is going on. Wolverhampton Wanderers sells a player for 6,000, 7,000, or 8,000 pounds, or whatever amount, but receives less than three-quarters of the amount. But at the same time, a small club sells a player for 6,000 pounds and puts every penny of it into its pocket.

Therefore, if Wolverhampton Wanderers buys a player for 10,000 pounds, they only receive something worth 7,250 pounds (if they can only get that amount when they sell). But if a small Third Division club buys a player for 5,000 pounds, they actually receive 5,000 pounds worth of "goods."

As for the one million pounds in entertainment tax, half of it (450,000 pounds) is obtained from football (football, English rugby, rugby league). In addition, about 20,000 pounds from cricket, 250,000 pounds from horse racing, and 270,000 pounds from other sports such as racing and greyhound racing. Tennis, boxing, gymnastics, ice hockey, etc., account for about 100,000 pounds.

Out of the 24,000 pounds in revenue from the Football Association Cup final, almost 5,000 pounds is for entertainment tax.

### The Revelation of Children

— Zu De

On Children's Day, I bought two toys—a machine gun and a tank—and gave them to two little children. Unexpectedly, both of them wanted the gun and the tank. I said that fighting a war requires division of labor and cooperation, each performing their own duties: the one firing the gun doesn't drive the tank, and the one driving the tank doesn't fire the gun. However, unexpectedly, they said: "Put the gun on the tank, one hand drives the tank, and the other hand fires the gun—bang, bang, bang—won't we wipe out all the ×× together?" I had nothing to say, so I had to buy another set for them.

Modern children are truly much smarter. Regardless of whether putting the gun on the tank is reasonable in combat, they do not follow old ways, are not deceived by your words, and are full of creativity. This is a new trend of 20th-century children, worthy of our attention. Moreover, they do not demand things from people in a forceful way. They use their thoughts and words to say things that make you praise or admire them and love them, so you cannot help but buy things for them. What sophisticated methods these are! They are only six or seven years old, yet they already exhibit such behavior. This is a positive result of modern elementary education. Compared to the effect of us reading the "human hand foot knife ruler" textbook in our childhood, it is much more brilliant; and compared to reading the "Three Character Classic" and "Hundred Family Surnames," there is a world of difference. I firmly believe that in ten or twenty years, our country will definitely not have lazy and incompetent people who blindly follow old ways, or fools who are deceived but do not think and still act recklessly, becoming social parasites and willingly becoming sinners of the nation.

One day, the two of them were "charging into battle" on the balcony. Suddenly, one of them cried, crying very sadly; the other one said very straightforwardly: "I'll pay you back, I'll pay you back!" It turned out that one child had broken the other child's tank.

Why was he crying so sadly? A tank isn't worth a dollar. Think about it: he never even thought about the issue of money. He only knew that his beloved toy was damaged, causing him sadness. Because in his pure heart, some traces had already been deeply imprinted—guns and tanks, or rather, a part of their little souls had already been poured into their beloved toys. How could he not be sad? Therefore, the direction in which a child grows depends entirely on the environment they are in and the things they come into contact with, which stimulate and elicit responses. Therefore, the foundation created by using this "childlike innocence" is difficult to be influenced by external forces. According to news reports, children at the Xuying Academy in Xiamen wrote slogans such as "Down with ××, Return Our Rivers and Mountains" during Children's Day, which is a very good piece of evidence. Recalling famous sayings such as "Early childhood education and elementary education are the lifeline of the country" and "The responsibility of the country lies on the shoulders of elementary school teachers," we cannot but be vigilant!

Furthermore, that one child was very frank. He broke someone else's toy and would only compensate! He did not lie, did not forget his responsibility, and believed that "one person is responsible for their own actions." He did not "insinuate" and shift blame onto others. This attitude is much more upright than those who clearly do something wrong but do not admit it, and instead go against the grain and stubbornly persist in their own way. However, there are many people in the world who wear masks, from high-ranking officials to peddlers, putting on a show and echoing each other. Today they write an "Essay on ××," and tomorrow they "give an example." This kind of behavior is truly inferior to that of children. Even the words in the song that children sing, "I live for China, I die for China," they misunderstand or even do not understand at all. Although they have spent decades drinking ink, it is to no avail. From this, I say: "They should learn from the children!" Recalling the two old sayings, "Having ambition does not depend on age, being ignorant is in vain even after a hundred years," I cannot help but applaud!

### Moonlit Night to Xuzhou

— Li Qiao

——Reminiscences of the Breakthrough from Xuzhou

Tong Village is a rather large village with about forty to fifty households. The spacious tile-roofed houses are more numerous than the sorghum-thatched cottages, a rare phenomenon in the North. It is about thirty miles away from Xuzhou, but for some reason, all the common people have fled. Every room is so empty, the furniture is casually arranged, and the thin dogs that have lost their owners and have been hungry for many days are timidly curled up in the corners, sleeping. They no longer dare to jump up and howl when they see strangers.

When we were in southern Shandong, the female comrades of the several war zone service groups who had been sent back returned to the team because the Longhai Railway was cut off. We heard that Xuzhou was in great danger and that there were no common people left. However, everyone still hoped to get to Xuzhou quickly, to defend that important military town and prevent the × people from trying to open up the Xupu Railway through Xuzhou!

× planes circled in the sky all day long, so the people and horses remained holed up in the houses, letting them waste more gasoline and ignoring them.

At 7 PM, we set off again, carrying a mortar shell and advancing along the highway in the darkness. The yellow dust flew up in thick clouds, covering people's bodies in a thick layer of yellow dust. Their nostrils were filled with mud, and people kept coughing. ...

A small village, bisected by the highway, was completely destroyed by the × planes. A thatched cottage was burned down by incendiary bombs, leaving only two fire-reddened earthen walls standing upright in the ruins. People were buried under the rubble, emitting a foul odor.

As if we had seen some kind of ghost, the nauseating stench was unbearable, and we couldn't help but run forward.

The moon slowly rose from the dim wilderness, and trees and villages emerged from the darkness. The clear moonlight shone palely on the sleeping wheat, which was still and motionless, enjoying the warmth of the moonlight.

Because we were waiting for the distribution of flour, the brothers stopped in a long line on the highway, preparing to receive the flour at Xidian before the team slowly continued its advance.

Because we couldn't wait for the flour, we shouldered the mortar shell and decided not to take the flour. In the bright moonlight, we walked for more than two hours on the thick yellow dust-covered highway, passing several protruding small hills, and arrived in Xuzhou.

This was no longer the Xuzhou we had passed through a month ago. At that time, Xuzhou was hot and bustling. Now, Xuzhou was dead. The houses on both sides of the street were like they had contracted some kind of infectious disease, all collapsed. Rubble lay on charred rafters, and the walls without roofs stood straight, as if complaining about the brutality of the × people. There was not a single person on the street. The rough footsteps did not even elicit a howl from a stray dog. The whole scene was one of desolation and terror, as if we had walked into some kind of dead city.

Suddenly, a car loaded with flour came running from the front. We hurriedly stopped it and asked for ten bags of flour. However, everyone saw that there was no way to carry it away, so we piled the flour and the mortar shell on a broken cart by the roadside, and seven or eight people pushed and pulled it along. It took a lot of effort to push it to the outside of the south gate, but we couldn't push it any further. We had no choice but to hide the ten bags of flour in a small thatched house by the roadside, and carry the mortar shell. In a burst of urgent gunfire, we hurriedly caught up with the team in front.

Da-da-da... the clear sound of machine guns rang out, and the rumbling sound of artillery also echoed. The air was so tense that it seemed about to explode. The people and horses just advanced quickly.

Sweating and laboriously shouldering the heavy mortar shell, I walked behind the team. Although I was a little surprised that the × people had already reached the outskirts of Xuzhou, I didn't expect that this would be the last day for Xuzhou, and that the next day (May 19th) the × people would enter Xuzhou.

We walked silently. When a dim dawn broke that day, a × plane flew in from behind, and the team hurriedly scattered into the wheat fields. It disappeared. The × plane flew away, and the people and horses once again formed an iron stream, surging forward.

### "Little Devils" in the Northwest - They Serve as Buglers, Messengers, Cooks, and Odd-Job Workers

More than 20,000 homeless Chinese refugee children, coming from all parts of China, have joined the Eighth Route Army in the Northwest to fight against Japan. Most of these children are between eleven and sixteen years old, so they are still too small to handle military equipment, but they serve as buglers, messengers, cooks, performers, and odd-job workers. Generally, people call these children "little devils." In every military camp, they are the happiest. They wear motley discarded military uniforms, often mismatched, and receive the same monthly allowance as regular troops, one yuan. One sunburnt-faced child told people that being a "little devil" is much more interesting than being a starving ghost in the fields in the Japanese-occupied areas. He left his hometown at the age of twelve and joined the army commanded by General Zhu De. Now, this child is generally considered very important, because he is the only one allowed to stand guard at the headquarters of the Eighth Route Army. Not many of these children have received education, but after joining the Eighth Route Army, they receive literacy education every morning.

They are known for their endurance and hard work. One fourteen-year-old child followed a team of officers on horseback for a day, walking forty-three miles. By 9 PM, the camp was set up, and he was still busily preparing beds for the officers like a squirrel.

In the evenings, these children often sit together and earnestly discuss various issues related to military science or political science that they have heard from the teachers during the day.

In every military camp, the "little devils" have their own military organizations and elect their own officers. One of the codes of honor they swear to uphold is similar to that of the American Boy Scouts.

Hundreds of children who joined the Red Army long ago during the civil war are now officers in the Eighth Route Army.

After undergoing military training, the "little devils" are the most reliable element in the combat force. For this reason, military commanders often choose their own guards from among them.

In addition to the "little devils," there are also thousands of Chinese youths, both male and female, in the Eighth Route Army, recruited from secondary schools and vocational schools all over the country. Now, they are engaged in various relief efforts behind the Chinese defense lines. Along the battlefield, from the front lines to the rear, there are hundreds of service stations. These young people are members of the Three Principles of the People Youth League. The service stations have medical equipment, books, magazines, kitchens, stoves, utensils, a small amount of rice, and boiling water. Many of the young people working at the service stations themselves admit that they ran away from home in order to fulfill their responsibilities to the war.

### War of Resistance and Poetry

— Xu Ting

Why has poetry after the Three Kingdoms era been so particularly developed in the literary world? Perhaps it is because of the great chaos in the world, and that writers and authors were all on the battlefield or wandering from place to place, and no longer had the time to bury themselves in books to write longer works. However, even in that chaotic era, people's emotions never disappeared, but rather grew in a special way, filled with tragic and stirring passion and lingering and mournful sorrow. As a result, this short and highly expressive form of poetry was greatly utilized and developed.

Now, the national War of Resistance: a great era has been unfolded. The literary world is currently preoccupied with the question of "why there are still no great works of art." I do not think this is so. I believe that this should be an era of great poetry creation.

According to an editor of a certain supplement, poems account for a very large number of the submissions received by literary publications, and this is precisely the reason why. However, every publication (of course, except for poetry publications) is restricted by the rule that poems should only account for one-eighth of the total content, and writers are also constrained by this, so poetry cannot be expanded. This is also the reason why modern poetry is not as developed as it was during the Three Kingdoms era.

We know that poetry is not inferior to other forms of literature; on the contrary, it is more convenient to write and has more emotional power. In our country today, writers are naturally like the writers of the Three Kingdoms era, on the battlefield or wandering from place to place. Even if they are temporarily settled, they are constrained by the need to use the format of essays to launch fierce attacks on the × people, traitors, and all corrupt elements, or to explain the meaning of the War of Resistance to the public in a thorough way. Therefore, although they have good subject matter, they do not have the time to engage in the creation of great works of art. However, the creation of poetry is not hindered; the short form is rich in emotional expression. If these publications can break the one-eighth rule, poetry will undoubtedly make rapid progress.

Let us sing the praises of the great achievements of this great era!

### Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

——The former is for her, and the latter is for him; between the two, although there is the same welcome and the same sincerity, the words and tones are mismatched and contradictory. Therefore, she regarded those who pinned their hopes on the fate of the motherland as enemies. Were these youths, who looked like rich men, the valiant soldiers who were engaged in arduous struggles? Were the touching photos of impoverished valiant soldiers that she had kept merely a deceptive miniature of them? Was the donation she had given to the valiant soldiers given to these extravagant spendthrifts of the wealthy? Her erroneous imagination went to infinitely far. She wanted to shout to them:

"You liars, I have been deceived for too long!" Because she did not know that their beautiful clothes were rented and temporarily borrowed, a false exterior. Her simple heart and eyes had not experienced the complex world.

Those strangers whom she had mistaken for wealthy youths, spendthrifts, and liars, surrounded Yu Wen, held his hands and feet, lifted him up high, and then swayed him in the air, expressing their gratitude and celebrating the success of his work. In their almost frantic swaying, his hat fell off and was trampled out of shape, and the buttons on his clothes came undone, revealing a torn shirt. He was like a child's toy - being played with to the highest degree, almost to the point of being damaged. Their laughter and the sound of shoes hitting the floor merged into one, making it difficult to distinguish. At this time, the world seemed to have only this one indistinguishable sound. They swayed him, spinning around the room, from one corner to another, and from one corner to the middle of the room. The room was no longer large enough for their activities. Only the simple tables and chairs were crowded and could not find a suitable place to stand still for even a moment, as if they had a sense of feeling and jumped along with them. Their revelry seemed to be the old motherland's moment of happiness.

In this revelry, she alone was neglected, under surveillance as if an abandoned orphan, unheeded. So, she beat her own chest with her fists and jumped up and down; in this way, she seemed to be able to relieve her stifled breath.

When Yu Wen saw this, he understood - he had forgotten her in his own revelry, exacerbating her annoyance and aversion. So, he immediately broke free from the hands of his comrades. He ran over, threw himself at her, wanting to hug him - the only acquaintance she now had, the only protector in her imagination. She couldn't help but pour out her complaints to him:

"If I had known you were bringing me to such a terrible place, I would rather have died in the street!"

He pulled her closer, gently stroking her shoulders with his fingers, and smiled at her, as if coaxing a child.

"Look, who dares to bully you!" Then, he said to all his comrades:

"From now on, no one is to upset Miss Zhu Lin. Treat her as our own little sister!" He turned to her and said, "If anyone makes things difficult for you, tell me, and I'll take responsibility!" (40)
