### Reflections on the Public Opinion of the Philippine People: Independence, Democracy, and a New Policy of Peace

— By G. Capadocia of Cabaduc, Philippines

The issue of Philippine independence is currently under debate in various circles. The general public holds diverse views on this matter. Some advocate for immediate and complete independence, while others favor a self-governing protectorate or an expanded autonomous republic. The happiness and prosperity of the Philippine people, as well as the nation's security, hinge on this issue. The Communist Party of the Philippines, in order to fully express its stance on this issue, hopes that every Filipino can understand and adopt it as their own opinion.

1.  Democracy and Fascism

We cannot separate the destiny of our nation from the destiny of all mankind, because the world today is divided into two main fronts engaged in struggle. Mad, fascist warlord aggressors are launching attacks on people who love democracy and peace. Italy has already occupied Abyssinia and is waging a war of aggression against the Spanish Republic. After seizing Manchuria, Japan is waging a war to conquer all of China, threatening the autonomy and peace of all Asian and Malay peoples. Japan, Germany, and Italy are the manufacturers of war, attempting to destroy all the progress of mankind over the centuries.

Opposing fascism are the forces of democracy and peace. Peace-loving people around the world have the glorious historical mission of stopping aggression, safeguarding peace, and paving the way for democracy. The people of the venerable Spanish Republic are resolutely waging a heroic war against those traitors in their country who have betrayed the nation and accepted the help of German and Italian fascist aggressors. At the same time, the Chinese people are also waging a similarly heroic war of resistance for their national survival, for our democracy and independence. Currently facing all mankind is the opposition of democracy and fascism, the opposition of peace and war, the opposition of progress and reaction. To develop our democracy, ensure our national security and the welfare of our people, and achieve complete national independence is inseparable from the global struggle of democracy against fascism.

Our country is also inevitably threatened by the conspiracies and aggression of fascist countries. Franco's henchmen, who are also the largest monopolists in the Philippines, are freely organizing to aid the rebels in Spain, while simultaneously establishing fascist organizations in the Philippines. Since the establishment of the alliance between Tokyo, Rome, and Berlin, Franco's henchmen have undoubtedly colluded with the lackeys of these three fascist countries in an attempt to destroy our autonomous republic.

If we do not recognize that we are under the threat of Japanese fascist aggression, then we will first fall into the danger of national suicide, because after Japan's fascism colludes with Germany and Italy, it is preparing for a new world war to destroy world democracy, and as a result, it will easily make the Philippines its military base to invade other nations in the Far East. Japanese warships and spies are active along the Pacific coast and in various straits. Japan has stationed heavy troops in Taiwan, close to the northern part of the Philippines. Its navy and air force directly control traffic between the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Its air force can intrude into the Philippine archipelago from its mandate in the South Seas, and has already invaded the Dutch East Indies and Borneo. Japanese officials brazenly regard themselves as the masters of the Philippines, treating the Philippine government and people with arrogance, just as they treat the Chinese government and people. Tokyo has repeatedly threatened the Philippines with a terrible fate if we have any movement opposing Japanese imperialism's interests in the Philippines. Their diplomats interfere strongly in Philippine internal affairs, even restricting our democratic rights, demanding the prohibition of our movements of sympathy and assistance to our heroic Chinese brothers. Japan has already regarded itself as the powerful master of the Philippines, only waiting for the opportunity to collude with Filipino rebels to turn the Philippines into a second Manchuria, Korea, or Taiwan.

Therefore, we cannot ignore this immense threat to national independence and security, because we bear a tremendous responsibility to our people and world democracy. Centuries of struggle for freedom, the heroic struggle against Spanish tyrants and American imperialism, the struggle to restore national sovereignty, the struggle to obtain more political freedoms, and the struggle to seek early national independence demand that we continue this spirit of struggle until we achieve complete freedom and liberation. The revolutionary martyrs Burgos, Rizal, Bonifacio, and Luna demand that we continue to wage a persistent struggle for freedom and democracy. The Communist Party of the Philippines has always revered these revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed themselves for independence, and believes that the common task is very sacred and must not allow irresponsible and adventurous ideas to mix into the independence movement. The Filipino people should take appropriate steps to ensure that they can protect themselves, defend the nation from Japanese aggression, and strengthen the forces of world democracy, so that the independence of the nation is based on democracy and security to resist foreign aggression.

2.  True and Guaranteed Independence

The Communist Party of the Philippines believes that the Filipino people cannot casually abandon their rights to self-determination and independence, because these rights were acknowledged through the Filipino people's long-term, heroic, and resolute struggle. The progressive government of the United States explicitly recognized in the Independence Act that the Philippines would be completely independent in 1946, after a plebiscite by the Filipino people. This is our victory, so we should defend it with the utmost enthusiasm. Because it is very clear that this right to independence is already under threat from fascist aggressors. We should exert our greatest efforts to defend these rights as a prerequisite for achieving the complete victory of democratic independence in the future. Whether we can maintain our rights to independence and whether we can obtain freedom does not depend on the Japanese fascist warlords and their allies, but on practical cooperation with the democratic countries of the world. Seceding from the United States does not stipulate that we immediately sever all relations with it. Whether the Filipino people are completely independent or whether we wait until 1946 should be determined by the special national environment in which we find ourselves. If waiting until 1946 to completely separate from the United States is more guaranteed, then in the current environment, immediately separating from all relations with the United States cannot guarantee the public greater democracy and true complete independence. Immediately severing all relations with the United States is equivalent to abandoning one of the largest democratic countries in the Pacific, causing serious setbacks to the nation's independence, peace, and security. The welfare of the Filipino people is based on cooperation with the United States and other progressive forces and democracy-loving people, and not on pleasing those fascists who attempt to invade the Philippines.

The tradition of the Filipino people, yearning for freedom, is the power of democracy; we must also be wary of those who advocate for immediate and complete independence at all costs. Whether these people are ignorant or ignorant tools of fascists, they are always urging us to blindly sever all relations with the United States. Fascist bandits are most adept at creating internal chaos and dividing the masses within the countries and nations they want to invade, for the sake of their aggression. These tools of Japanese fascism in the Philippines, under the guise of the slogan "Asia for Asians," exploit the Filipino people's desire for freedom, falsely claiming that Japanese fascism is a liberator of freedom. But the Filipino people will not and do not want to fall for this dangerous propaganda, because this dangerous propaganda has already enslaved several nations in East Asia and is continuing to carry out a conspiracy to conquer all of Asia. Those who carry out such propaganda among the Filipino people are being instigated by Japanese fascists to undermine and oppose the Philippine autonomous republic and the United States. The role they play is the same as that played by the tools of German fascism in Austria, allowing Germany to annex Austria. These Filipino fascist tools are traitors who betray the independence movement and are public enemies of the Filipino people. If their betrayal of independence is not stopped, it will sell out the Filipino people to the fascist warlords who rule Japan, forcing them to live like cattle under their iron hooves.

At the same time, the Communist Party of the Philippines opposes long-term bondage under the United States. American monopolists in the Philippines, with the support of a few Filipino sugar merchants and other businessmen, are tied to American interests and are taking advantage of the actual environment in which the Philippines finds itself to vigorously persuade the Filipino people to be ruled by the United States for a long time. But the main issue at present is not immediate independence versus long-term rule by the United States, but protecting the security of democratic countries against the aggression of fascist warlords. Therefore, we believe that under the current oppression of domestic and international reactionary forces, the Filipino people have no reason or need to blindly clamor for immediate independence, autonomy, expansion of the autonomous republic, and long-term rule by the United States. Under the current environment, under the Independence Act, we can strive for the welfare of the people, protect and expand democratic rights, and seek the early realization of national independence. Therefore, we strive to protect these stipulated Independence Acts, as well as the rights already obtained in the constitution of the Republic: a democratic republican system of government, a higher degree of self-government than we have enjoyed in the past, and recognition of the right to national independence. We should strive to defend these rights against the interference of domestic fascists and foreign aggressors. We strive to preserve the nation's wealth from being plundered by monopolists, and to protect and develop our resources and industries.

At the same time, before the implementation of the Independence Act, we should strive to expand democratic politics and seek fuller autonomy. In fact, the more the democratic relationship between the United States and the Philippines develops, the more it will enable the people of the two countries to cooperate in a friendly and voluntary manner. Under the current relationship, it is also possible to obtain fuller autonomy, seek the welfare of the Filipino people, and seek equal rights for Filipinos in Hawaii and the United States with Americans. If it comes time to amend the Independence Act, the Communist Party of the Philippines will encourage the Filipino people to establish a Philippine independent democratic republic, to form political treaties of friendship with the United States and Britain for the sake of mutual self-defense, mutual assistance, and mutual benefit in commerce. On this point, the Filipino people can vote in a plebiscite to decide, so that they can enjoy full rights.

3.  Struggle for Peace and Democracy Against Fascism and War

Our freedom issue cannot be separated from the issue of war and peace. We cannot bear to see our cities and villages subjected to the barbarous burning and killing of fascist aggressors, like the burning and killing in Guernica, Barcelona, Madrid, Shanghai, Nanjing, Xiamen, and Guangzhou in Spain. Some people tell us that if we continue to maintain such a relationship with the United States, the Philippines will become a target of attack by invaders and turn into a battlefield. Thus, according to their view, immediate and complete independence will guarantee our neutrality and prevent us from being drawn into the vortex of conflict. Do they really believe that Japanese fascists would not immediately seize the Philippines as a base for invading China, the Dutch East Indies, Indochina, and the United States? Are they not madly thinking that the Filipino people would submit without resistance under the iron hooves of the Japanese fascist warlords? We want to assure them that the Filipino people will bravely fight resolutely against fascist aggressors, just as they have fought for freedom in the past, and will stand on the side of democracy and progress to fight resolutely against reactionary fascism.

Although it is still possible to avoid the world war that fascist warlords are preparing for or have already launched, the way to avoid it is not to simply submit to their threats and aggression, but to actively inflict serious blows on the aggressors. In the past, China simply submitted to the threats and aggression of Japanese fascism, dreaming of sacrificing everything to seek compromise, and as a result, it lost Manchuria, created Japan's ruling position in North China, and continued to make unreasonable demands on the Chinese people. Only the great unity of the Chinese people formed on the basis of the united front of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has a strong resistance, so that Japan has to pay a great price for every step it takes, and it has suffered several major defeats, showing the heroic fighting spirit of the Chinese people in front of the world, and making the world believe that the final victory belongs to China.

The great path to defending and restoring peace is a collective security system, with the peace-loving people of all countries cooperating to jointly punish the instigators of war. The reason why fascist warlords dare to be so arbitrary and tyrannical is due to the indecision and wavering of democratic countries, which fail to impose collective sanctions on aggressors in a timely manner. But the people of the democratic countries, especially the people of the United States, are eagerly demanding that the government adopt a collective security policy to sanction aggressors. The President of the United States also declared in his speech on October 5, 1937, that all the people of the Philippines should join the people of these democratic countries to jointly protect and promote the security system to sanction fascist aggressors.

It is no accident and not surprising that such reactionary forces opposed to progressives can be found among American isolationists, just as it is no accident that some people in the Philippines are clamoring for immediate and complete independence from the United States. For example, Congressman O'Malley is trying hard to play the role of an anti-imperialist, clamoring for the Philippines to take immediate action and adopt an isolationist policy. Senator Borah, the most reactionary leader of the Republican Party and the spokesman for monopoly capitalists, always opposes every new policy that is beneficial to the people and also demands immediate and complete independence for the Philippines. Hoover, the spokesman for big businessmen, pretends to be a demagogue who cares about democracy and freedom, using this to cover up his fascist face, attacking Roosevelt as a dictator, and at the same time, when American progressive forces are fighting, he tries his best to help the fascist forces launch a barbaric attack on the democratic forces. These reactionary fascist elements, monopolists, and big businessmen in the United States are fiercely plundering the American people's democratic rights and standard of living, and at the same time, they are the resistance that prevents the United States from adopting a collective security policy abroad. These elements are the masterminds and successors of the imperialist President McKinley who sent troops to seize our country when we were winning the revolutionary war for independence from Spain. It is also these elements who collude with fascist warlords to condone the Japanese, German, and Italian fascist lackeys, violating the will and wishes of the vast majority of the American people, dreaming of the victory of fascism. At the same time, these most reactionary elements are doing their best to instigate the Filipino people to separate from all relations with the United States and become independent at the present time, using this as a reason to demand that their government withdraw from the Far East and refuse to establish a collective security system and act in concert with democratic countries.

On the other hand, the labor movement in the United States, which seeks to improve the living conditions of the people, and the democratic movement to defend democracy against fascists and monopolists, both support President Roosevelt's progressive policies and demand that he strengthen the power of the collective security policy to combat the instigators of war. These people have always been loyal to American democracy and continue the mission of the American People's Party and the Anti-Imperialist League. When McKinley sent troops to occupy the Philippines, they demanded that we be independent. The democracy-loving people in the democratic countries of the Western Hemisphere—Canada, the United States, Mexico, and the Latin American countries—have already united to fight for peace, democracy, and security against the fascist elements within these countries and the conspirators from fascist countries abroad. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy is intended to foster better relations between the United States and these countries and has been accepted and implemented by the people of these countries to counter reactionary fascism. The Filipino people are directly threatened by the brutal Japanese fascist warlords. In order to protect the nation's autonomy and guarantee future independence and security, they should form a democratic front with the people of the democratic countries of the Western Hemisphere.

The destiny of democracy and the independence movement are inseparable from all the pressing needs of the broad masses of the people, just as the struggle for freedom is inseparable from the struggle to improve the living conditions of the people. Therefore, full democracy should give the people the right to demand better living conditions and to fight for them. Once the people have full freedom to fight to improve their lives, the democratic forces will also be strengthened. Therefore, the government should not prohibit the people's movements, but should encourage them and give them practical assistance. Because the prevalence of mass movements can best guarantee democracy, defend national security, and establish a free democratic republic.

We are striving to pursue the free development of democratic political institutions, but fascists and adventurers and pro-Japanese elements are doing their best to harm them. These pro-Japanese elements and Franco's henchmen and supporters, the fascist-leaning monopolists in the Philippines, and some Filipino reactionary elements collude with each other to threaten to destroy Philippine democracy, forcing the Philippines to commit suicide and unite with the reactionary forces of the world, while using the issue of Philippine independence to attack progressive and democratic forces.

The Communist Party of the Philippines clearly points out that the main issue at present is the issue of democracy against fascism. We vow to stand at the forefront of the people and do everything in our power to defend democracy and eliminate the reactionary forces that attempt to harm it.

In order to achieve this goal of protecting and developing democracy and promoting independence, the Communist Party of the Philippines believes that a national organization is needed to defend the Philippine autonomous republic against aggressors. This is a necessary step to achieve a fully sovereign independent country. Our national defense construction should advance simultaneously with national industrial construction, so national defense construction can only be based on the level of economic development, otherwise it will increase the burden on the people. We should accept American technical and other assistance on the one hand, and emphasize upholding the collective security system as an effective strategy to stop aggressors and defend peace. Cooperating with the democratic and progressive forces in the United States with this strategy, and further cooperating with China, the Dutch East Indies, France, and especially the Soviet Union, which is willing and able to protect the security of the Philippines. Although the Filipino people can bravely resist aggressors, if we cooperate with these democratic countries, it can reduce our sacrifices and make it easier to defend our autonomous republic. Only those isolationists, who are willing to give away our country to Japanese imperialism for nothing, boast that the Philippines is already sufficient to defend itself and is not easily attacked. This statement is intended to deceive the Filipino people, making them unaware of the current danger and abandoning the policy of collective security. If we really follow these people's words, thinking that it is sufficient to take an isolationist policy, then the security of the Philippines will be in serious danger, and if the autonomous government implements such a dangerous policy, the result can only be an attempt to build up armaments that its national strength cannot afford. How dangerous is this!

However, while supporting national defense construction and the collective security system, the Communist Party of the Philippines particularly pointed out that the burden of national defense cannot be placed on the masses. When President Quezon first took office, Congress began to take all possible steps to amend the tax laws. Although progress is very slow, for the sake of national income and the happiness of the people, taxes on large corporations, inheritances, and high incomes should be increased, while reducing the burden on the poor.

### Supporting the War of Resistance and Unification - The 10th Anniversary of the Jinan Massacre

Ten years ago today marked the beginning of Japanese ××-ism's armed intervention in the Chinese Revolution and the beginning of its armed invasion of China.

Ten years ago today was also the day the Chinese nation suffered the shame of humiliation under the pro-Japanese Huang Fu and others' line of humiliatingly seeking peace.

In the 17th year of the Republic of China (1928), the National Revolutionary Army overcame Lincheng and advanced towards Jinan. The Japanese Tanaka Cabinet, in order to support feudal warlords and reactionary corrupt regimes to prevent the resurgence of the Chinese revolution and achieve its ambition of conquest, immediately decided to send troops to Shandong. It dispatched 50 warships and 50,000 soldiers, with Fukuda as the commander. On the 29th of April, the Northern Expeditionary Army of the National Revolution arrived at Jinan City, and Fukuda's interventionist army also arrived in Jinan that day to confront the Northern Expeditionary Army. On May 3rd, they actually launched an attack on the Northern Expeditionary Army and massacred civilians and soldiers. At that time, Cai Gongshi, the Special Commissioner of Foreign Affairs in Shandong, was brutally tortured for refusing the unreasonable demands of the Japanese side, his eyes were gouged out, his ears and nose were cut off, and then he and more than a dozen staff members of the diplomatic commissioner's office were shot to death. Starting on May 8th, they launched a general offensive, searching residents everywhere, looting property, massacring soldiers, and shooting pedestrians. More than 10,000 innocent civilians were killed. At that time, the pro-Japanese Huang Fu, under the pressure of the Japanese army, humiliatingly sought peace, agreed to all the demands of the Japanese army, and ordered the Northern Expeditionary Army to withdraw from Jinan. At that time, the revolutionary soldiers, although they had united with the workers in the city and the citizens in the nearby suburbs to oppose the humiliating treaty and bravely resist the Japanese army, finally retreated completely on the 11th with great sacrifices due to running out of ammunition and supplies.

From that day on, Japan dared to take large-scale military actions to invade China, ×××××, even affecting foreigners in China and their legal rights and interests. Also from that day on, every Chinese person began to recognize that the Japanese invaders colluded with Chinese feudal warlords, traitorous politicians, and all reactionary forces, and the angry tide of opposing Japan × and opposing traitors also began to surge in every city and village.

However, because there was no unity within China, because the policy of compromise and seeking peace by pro-Japanese elements in China had not been shattered, and especially because the people of China had not automatically and actively united to resist Japan × and traitors, the countercurrent of pro-Japanese traitors has been able to proceed unhindered for ten years, and the iron hooves of Japanese ×× have moved from Shandong Province to the three northeastern provinces, from beyond the pass to deep into our hinterland, ×××××, ××××, and all the tragic and unbelievable events have been continuously staged on our Chinese territory, until the Lugouqiao Incident in July and the Shanghai Incident in August two years ago, until the Kuomintang and the Communist Party declared cooperation and the whole country united to resist foreign aggression ×, the × behavior of Japan × and traitors encountered comprehensive and resolute resistance for the first time.

Ten years later today, the iron hooves of Japanese ×× have penetrated into various parts of our northern, central, and southern regions, and the bombing cannons of Japanese ×× ××××× have even plunged all our beautiful mountains and rivers, the embroidered fields, and the newly emerging cities into a bloody, terrifying, and dark state! As we reflect on the pain, we deeply feel that the following points deserve the attention of the whole country:

First, we must recognize that the Japanese invaders' attack is the implementation of a plan to destroy China that was decided as early as ten years ago. Their target is all of China, the entire Chinese nation, and every Chinese person who is unwilling to be a slave. The Japanese army's massacre of civilians and the killing of Mr. Cai Gongshi in the May 3rd Massacre in an attempt to eliminate our people's spirit of resistance is enough to imagine. Therefore, today we must step up our efforts to enhance national self-esteem and self-confidence, mobilize the vital forces of the entire people, support the central leadership, strengthen national unity, persist in the war of resistance by the whole people, and strive for final victory.

Second, we must recognize that the Japanese invaders are the obstructors of the Chinese national liberation and rejuvenation movement. They try every possible means to attack our Chinese revolutionary movement and revolutionary forces in seeking independence, freedom, and equality. Because when our patriotic movement and revolutionary forces rise, the actions of the Japanese invaders will be subject to sanctions, so they try every possible means to eliminate our patriotic movement and revolutionary forces, first of all, to attack the leaders of this movement and forces. At the time of the May 3rd Massacre, they used the slogan of "preventing redification" to attack the Kuomintang's unification of China. Today, ten years later, they are still using the slogan of "anti-communism and anti-Chiang" to undermine the united front of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Therefore, today we must step up our efforts to resist this attempt by the Japanese invaders, and we must also strengthen our internal unity, and develop our patriotic movement and revolutionary forces. The first priority is to enrich and develop the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, which lead China's war of resistance and national construction, and to consolidate and expand the anti-Japanese national united front. Only in this way can we effectively smash the × people's attempts.

Third, we must also recognize that in its destruction of the Chinese liberation and rejuvenation movement, the main strategy of the Japanese invaders is to use the political conspiracy of "using Chinese to control Chinese" in coordination with its military attacks. ×××× at that time was the beginning of the dual poisonous strategy of Japan × using both political and military means. At the time of Fushi, on the one hand, they used military force to assist feudal warlords and corrupt and reactionary regimes, and on the other hand, they used political conspiracies to exploit wavering and compromising elements in the revolutionary camp, especially pro-Japanese elements. Today, ten years later, they are not only using all the remnants of feudal forces, not only using all the dregs of the Chinese people, the backward warlords, bureaucrats, and politicians, but also using the wavering and compromising elements, stubborn and conservative elements, selfish and self-interested elements, and narrow-minded elements who do not understand the overall situation and do not care about the overall situation on the revolutionary and anti-Japanese front. They instructed ×× Wang Jingwei to advocate the anti-communist peace movement, although it has failed, but they are helping these traitors to establish a puppet central government and establish a puppet anti-communist army in an attempt to intensify the occupation of the occupied areas and intensify the conspiracy to destroy China, which has become even more serious! Therefore, we must not only fight against all feudal remnants, national traitors, and pro-Japanese traitors in action, but also fight against the words and actions that are lurking within the anti-Japanese front, intentionally or unintentionally spreading the "anti-communist peace" smoke screen for Japan × and hindering the war of resistance and national construction, theoretically and in all aspects. Only through vigilant and tenacious struggle can we overcome the × traitor's conspiracy and strive for final victory. Enhancing the strength to oppose traitors, puppets, and pro-Japanese elements, and enhancing the strength to oppose wavering and compromising elements, is the most urgent task at present.

"Do not forget the past, it is a lesson for the future." We would like to use the above three points to hope for the efforts of our government and various parties and groups, and to hope for the efforts of every Chinese compatriot who is unwilling to be a slave.

Puppet Troops Defecting in Large Numbers

[Central News Agency, Lihuang, 1st] Xun Jiayun, the puppet "bandit suppression commander" in Huaiyuan, who had been trapped on the × side and possessed over a thousand guns, has organized five brigades and recently defected, surrounding Huaiyuan. The puppet county magistrate, He Junxia, drowned himself in the river. Ye Jinye, a × special agent, drowned himself in the river on his way to Bengbu to ask for help, feeling ashamed of his responsibility. Puppet troops along the Huai River, upon hearing the news, are all inclined to defect. The puppet provincial governor is very panicked. Xun has sent a representative to Li.

### Spiritual Mobilization Association Sends Telegram to the Whole Country; As National Monthly Meetings Begin, It is Hoped That Local Leaders Will Lead the People

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The National Spiritual Mobilization Association has sent a telegram to the mobilization committees of various provinces and, through them, to all compatriots in the country, saying, "Since the time of Duke Zhuang of Chu, his monarchs have never failed to train the people and the army has never failed to reiterate its respect. This is a clear effect of encouraging the spirit of the army and the people to achieve prosperity. As the national monthly meetings of spiritual mobilization begin, the chairman himself is taking the lead and giving detailed instructions, so the people of the country should be alert and understand thoroughly. In the lower echelons, we should deeply feel encouraged. National monthly meetings are a universal and regular task. The key to the success of spiritual mobilization is whether it can exert its highest efficiency in the coming month. The responsibility for supervision is entrusted to party, government, educational personnel, and fair-minded people in the locality. They should practice what they preach and set an example for the people, to uplift their own spirits and awaken national consciousness. The main point lies here. The supervision and assessment of higher-level mobilization agencies, as well as mutual observation, are essential components for promoting the work. We should also pay close attention to the fact that the second phase of the war of resistance is in full swing, and the great cause of nation-building is in the middle of the road. We must concentrate our spirits to overcome the difficulties. The advocacy of spiritual mobilization has a profound meaning, and we should make thorough plans at the beginning. We should strive to recognize the goals, abide by the outline, unite as one, and move forward with efforts. The victory or defeat in the future depends on whether we are diligent today. We must make a transformation to create a national atmosphere of strength and perseverance. We hope that we will encourage each other to achieve complete success." Secretariat of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association

### A Powerful New Force in the War of Resistance: North China Railway Demolition Team

— Chen Zhengfei

This time, our country's heroic war of resistance began in North China. The North China battlefield was a month earlier than any other battlefield. However, it was the experience and lessons learned in this short month that allowed North China to make rapid progress. Whether in military affairs, political mobilization of the people, or even cultural education in the war zone, none were exceptions, and all unfolded with a new attitude.

The fact is clearly demonstrated that when the flames of war ignited at Lugou Bridge and set ablaze the entire country's resistance, due to the inferiority of our military equipment and the lack of experience in commanding large formations, the war situation in North China was in an extremely disadvantageous position. To the north, we lost Nankou in one battle, followed by the abandonment of Datong, Xinkou, and finally withdrew from Taiyuan and Linfen. To the south, we lost Baoding, Zhengding, abandoned Shijiazhuang, Niangziguan, and eventually opened Zhangde and Xinxiang... But no one could have imagined that in this critical situation, relying on our firm will to resist and our shattered mountains and rivers, we would rebuild a solid iron Great Wall. Not only did it stop the headlong rush of the **, but it also gave the ** countless serious blows. Even today, after one year and eight months, it has tied down a full ten divisions of the ** and more than 400,000 puppet troops, making the ** regard North China as its heartland. As for the various aspects of politics and economy, they have also been unexpectedly and rapidly reborn. When this reporter climbed over the Taihang Mountains, crossed one mountain city after another, the phenomena I saw were truly filled with endless joy and excitement. However, in this short dispatch, I will first introduce the North China anti-Japanese war's new railway demolition team, which is performing with a brand new attitude and using the most subtle power to give the ** the most serious blows.

This railway demolition team was spontaneously led by a Chinese worker ** who had participated in the European War. In the beginning, he only led fifty railway workers and more than twenty passionate young people, working hard. Now, it has developed into ** large teams, as well as personnel selected from the ** divisions to learn demolition work there, totaling over ****. Due to the establishment of this demolition team, the Daokou-Qinghua Railway has suffered the loss of 48 locomotives and 277 military, passenger, and freight cars. In the past year, the Daokou-Qinghua Railway has not been able to operate smoothly and safely. Finally, the ** people are unwilling to ride this "death train" and would rather walk on their two ** legs. (To be continued)

### Meritorious Generals Promoted: Chen Cheng and Others Promoted to Second-Class Generals; National Government Order Issued Yesterday

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 2nd] The National Government issued an order on the 3rd: (1) Lieutenant General Chen Cheng and Wei Lihuang, with the rank of Lieutenant General, are promoted to General, Second Class. This order: (1) Lieutenant Generals Zhang Zizhong and Sun Zhen are specially awarded the rank of General. This order.

### National Spiritual Mobilization Implemented: Chairman Chiang's Broadcast Speech

(Continued from yesterday) I especially hope that all our compatriots living far away in the rear, such as in the Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hankou concessions, as well as overseas and in Hong Kong, especially our young men and women, must remember the enemies and humiliations of your country. In spirit, you must be self-reliant and strong. In life, you must be self-loving and self-respecting. You must be responsible and know shame. This is because I have heard reports from Chinese and foreign people from Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou that there are still young people living in the concessions who are dancing, wandering, and do not know how to love themselves. I feel very heartbroken when I hear this. You should all know that you are lonely ministers and illegitimate children suffering under the oppression of the ** people, so you must be diligent, frugal, able to endure hardship and work hard, and especially take labor as your duty and service as your purpose. No matter where or when, you must be self-reliant and strong, and never be looked down upon by the ** people. More importantly, be respected by friendly nations. If they see that our young citizens can all understand etiquette, know integrity, have aspirations, have a sense of honor, and be diligent and thrifty, then they will have endless hope for the future of our country and will be able to enhance the personality of our country. This requires all our men and women across the country to unanimously fulfill the creeds of the National Spiritual Mobilization and practice the oaths of the National Covenant, which are: (1) Do not violate the Three Principles of the People; (2) Do not violate government laws and regulations; (3) Do not violate the interests of the country and the nation; (4) Do not be a traitor or a docile subject of the ** country; (5) Do not participate in traitor organizations; (6) Do not respect ** soldiers and traitor officers; (7) Do not work for the ** people and traitors; (8) Do not spy for the ** people and traitors; (9) Do not work for the ** people and traitors; (10) Do not use banknotes from ** people and traitor fake banks; (11) Do not buy goods from ** people; (12) Do not provide food and supplies to the ** people and traitors. In this way, we can arm ourselves spiritually, not be threatened by the violence of the ** people, not be tempted by the bait of the ** people, show our independence and self-reliance, not fear danger, and not be opportunistic in the face of difficulty, so that the ** people will be especially afraid and dare not look down upon and oppress us. In short, at today's critical juncture in the war of resistance, whether we are in the front or the rear, or even in any area that has fallen, we must implement national spiritual mobilization and strictly enforce the National Covenant, which is to thoroughly implement the new life of etiquette, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame. From today onwards, everyone must make this determination and be worthy of being an independent and self-reliant citizen. Compatriots, you must also know that the spiritual mobilization movement cannot be effective with just five minutes of enthusiasm. We must persevere and become stronger over time, so we must be persistent and continuous. The purpose of spiritual mobilization is not only to encourage each of us to struggle hard today but also to create a new life and a new spirit for our nation through sustained training. We must constantly examine ourselves, sharpen ourselves, and spur ourselves on. Tang's inscription on the basin reads: "If you can renovate yourself for one day, then do so from day to day, and again from day to day." We must have this awareness and determination to constantly renovate, constantly struggle, and constantly strengthen our human and material resources to break the brutal and arrogant aggression of the ** people and realize our great Three Principles of the People. Fellow compatriots, you must know that today's spiritual mobilization and national covenant are our invisible guns and the ultimate planes and bombs. In other words, this spiritual mobilization and national covenant are also the greatest weapons of the war of resistance, and the organization of our National Monthly Meeting is the spiritual fortress of our anti-Japanese people. Therefore, we must thoroughly implement it and maintain it consistently. The effect of such vigorous implementation will definitely be more valuable and powerful than any steel and concrete fortresses. Therefore, after the start of the National Monthly Meeting, we must not follow the old ways of doing things as before. We must eradicate the bad habits of temporary perfunctoriness and responsibility, and we must implement the program regulations in a practical and down-to-earth manner. It must be known that the National Monthly Meeting is the morning bell for our spiritual reform. Today, the ** people are invading our China, committing rape, arson, and murder everywhere. They are worse than pigs and dogs. This shame is more painful than the hatred of killing one's father. Each of us should constantly ask ourselves: "Have you forgotten the great hatred of the ** people invading your country and massacring your compatriots? Have you forgotten the shame of the ** people seizing your land, bombing your houses, killing your fathers, sons, and brothers, and defiling your mothers, daughters, and sisters?" If we can constantly remind and encourage ourselves in this way, reflect on ourselves, and encourage each other, we will naturally not do such foolish things as living in a drunken dream and seeking temporary ease. We must also further think about the strange humiliation and deep pain we have suffered in the past fifty years, and we will surely be able to invigorate everyone and inspire everyone to achieve the goal of revenge, wiping out shame, resisting Japan, and building the country. From today onwards, after the National Monthly Meeting begins, I hope that not only can everyone be sincere, take the lead, and set an example, but also sincerely encourage and supervise each other. We must create a new atmosphere. On the one hand, the pillars of society must set an example and take the lead in advocating, and on the other hand, everyone must supervise each other, correct mistakes, persuade people to do good, and encourage each other. Today, if each of us is only concerned with our own well-being, we will be saving the country. We must recognize that if a compatriot or a colleague cannot implement spiritual mobilization, it is a disgrace to our entire country. We must embrace a heart of public loyalty and enthusiasm, and not only be responsible for ourselves and abide by discipline, but also encourage fathers and sons to encourage each other, and jointly supervise each other to promote it. We must strictly implement assessment and supervision, learn from each other, and promote the inherent noble and great spirit of our Chinese nation. I hope that from today onwards, a new atmosphere of universal development and revival will be created in the country. The previous dynasties of our province, even during the creation of the country, had a kind of hardworking, resilient, vigorous, and enterprising spirit, and a spirit of worry and vigilance. If this spirit does not decline, no matter what, the country will not perish. Looking at the end of the Jin Dynasty, the Five Dynasties, and the end of the Song and Ming Dynasties, the court and the public were filled with a kind of drunken, dreamy, selfish, and self-interested atmosphere, and a situation of emptiness, dispersion, division, and confusion. We must constantly think about the lessons of the rise and fall of past dynasties, recall the difficulties faced by our ancestors in building the country, and make up our minds to struggle and strive to fulfill the responsibility of wiping out shame and revenge. We must be deeply aware that the national disaster at this time is entirely the result of our generation's indulgence, decline, and unwillingness to compete. If our generation cannot avenge ourselves and wipe out shame, we will truly have no way to face our ancestors above, and no way to face our descendants below. Today, there are actually a small number of traitors and degenerates, and people with weak wills and lost spirits, who are engaged in shameless acts of selling out the country. This is truly a disgrace and misfortune to our country. But every descendant of the Yellow Emperor with ambition and vigor must be determined to be loyal to the country and filial to the nation, which is to be loyal to their responsibilities, loyal to their duties, loyal to the laws, and loyal to discipline, to fulfill our bounden mission of resisting Japan and building the country. The rise and fall of our country for centuries, and the honor and disgrace of our country for thousands of years, will depend on whether we can thoroughly implement the creeds of national spiritual mobilization in this revolutionary era that is difficult to come by in a thousand years, whether we can vigorously implement the rules of the National Covenant, and whether we can earnestly implement the program for resisting Japan and building the country. If we can all implement it, then we will surely be able to jointly and consistently unite our spirits under the three major goals of "the country above all else, the nation above all else; military affairs first, victory first; concentration of will, concentration of strength," to smash the aggressive policies of the ** people, realize our Three Principles of the People, and complete our great cause of revolutionary nation-building. Fellow compatriots, goodbye! (End)

### German-Polish Relations Grow Tense: Beck to Respond to German Demands in Two Days; Resolution to Use Force to Prevent Annexation of Danzig

[Warsaw, Reuters, 2nd] The cabinet today passed a bill to grant the president additional financial powers to facilitate national defense matters.

[Paris, Haitong News Agency, 2nd] According to the Paris Evening News, before Colonel Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, delivered his speech, the Polish government sent a note to the German Foreign Ministry, conveyed by the Polish Ambassador to Germany, stating that the Polish government refused to negotiate with Germany on the Danzig and Polish Corridor issues.

[Warsaw, Reuters, 2nd] People here believe that Colonel Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, will deliver a speech in the Polish Parliament on Friday, responding to Hitler's speech, and will make counter-demands to Germany. Regarding the content of this demand, the Polish Ambassador to the United States has drafted a relevant statement, stating that Poland will demand guarantees of economic and other rights in Danzig.

[New York, Associated Press, 1st] The Polish Ambassador officially stated today that the Polish government has just issued a declaration, reiterating its determination to use force to prevent Germany from annexing Danzig. The Polish Foreign Minister will deliver a speech in Parliament on Friday to respond to Hitler's demands, and will also make counter-demands to Germany. The Polish Ambassador also said that Poland will maintain its position to the end and will not compromise.

[London, Associated Press, 1st] The Berlin correspondent of the "Daily Mail" reported that Hitler has given Poland fourteen days to respond to the demands he made in his speech last Friday, namely, to cede Danzig and for Germany to build a military road through the Polish Corridor directly to East Prussia. German newspapers have now intensified their attacks on Poland, especially focusing on Foreign Minister Beck. The German side is also constantly publicizing news of Polish people mistreating German expatriates. Diplomatic observers deeply believe that the current situation should be given close attention, and said that the gradual tension in German-Polish relations is deliberately created by the German side, and they want to take the opportunity to act swiftly. French political circles are closely watching Danzig, and French people are very worried about Germany's major attacks on Poland.

[Warsaw, Haitong News Agency, 2nd] According to well-informed sources, judging from the tone of the newspapers, Colonel Beck's speech will contain several sections attacking Germany. The semi-official "Polish Gazette" stated that if Danzig is returned to Germany, just like the Memel region, Poland's access to the sea will be cut off. Therefore, the Polish government may be forced to demand guarantees of the rights and interests of Polish people in the city. The "Polish Express" also has the same tone. The "Warsaw Transmission" reported that if Germany attacks Danzig, it will definitely not be as easy as taking the Memel region without spending a single soldier or bullet. However, if it is taken by force, a European war will break out.

[Berlin, Haitong News Agency, 2nd] Today, German newspapers commented on and refuted the new Polish demands regarding the Free City of Danzig, which were published in several Polish newspapers, saying that Poland's current tough attitude is the result of the guarantees made by Britain. The "Berlin Daily" stated that Germany had foreseen that Britain's guarantees to Poland would make the Polish government's attitude even tougher and would not be able to influence Poland to conduct reconciliation in an open and honest manner. The tone of Polish newspapers is nothing more than an expression of the Polish government's great desires.

Black Sea Group

French and Soviet Representatives Arrive in Turkey to Proceed; Soviet Union and Turkey to Join Peace Front

[Paris, Haitong News Agency, 2nd] General Weygand, the leader of the French delegation that went to Tehran to congratulate the Iranian Crown Prince on his wedding, arrived in Ankara yesterday and will discuss the current situation with Turkish political figures and meet with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin. French officials here attach great importance to Weygand's talks in Turkey and believe that they will do their best to persuade Turkey to join the anti-aggression front.

[Ankara, Central News Agency, 1st] Diplomatic activities here have been very noteworthy in recent days. The Turkish President yesterday received Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin, French Ambassador Massigli, and former French Army Chief of Staff Weygand separately. Weygand also arrived here today, all wanting to prepare for the establishment of a Black Sea Pact between Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, and the Soviet Union. If this pact is to be established, the issue of the Dobruja province between Bulgaria and Romania must be resolved (the province belonged to Bulgaria before the Second Balkan War and was assigned to Romania after the war).

[Ankara, Haitong News Agency, 2nd] According to political opinions here, General Weygand, the leader of the French delegation, will stay here for three days to discuss matters with the Turkish government, including the merger of Turkey and the Black Sea republics and the improvement of the Franco-Turkish agreement of July 1938.

[London, Associated Press, 1st] Negotiations to bring the Soviet Union and Turkey into the "Peace Front" are nearing completion. It is hoped that the results of negotiations in London, Paris, Moscow, Warsaw, and Ankara will enable thirteen active countries and four passive countries to form a united peace front, with Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Poland, and Turkey as the main members.

Anglo-Soviet Talks

Discussion on the Overall Situation; British Parliamentarians Pay Attention to Japanese Actions

[London, Reuters, 1st] After returning from Moscow, Soviet Ambassador Maisky met with British Foreign Secretary Halifax today. According to descriptions from Downing Street, the two had a "very long and extremely harmonious meeting." As for when the Anglo-Soviet talks will end, it has not yet been decided. It is heard that the participants discussed the overall situation involved in the recent negotiations, as well as the ways in which other countries cooperate in anti-aggression. Officials said that the British Ambassador to Poland did not discuss the implementation of British guarantees to Poland when he met with Polish Foreign Minister Beck in Warsaw, but only exchanged impressions of Hitler's speech, especially the part related to Poland, and the German proposals on the Danzig issue, as well as Poland's response. Authoritative sources also stated that the issue of British guarantees to Poland has been fully stated, and so far, no incident has occurred that would change or reduce its effectiveness.

[London, Reuters, 1st] Reuters diplomatic reporters have learned that neither side in the British-Soviet talks intends to involve the Far East. The goal of the talks is purely limited to Europe. British policy is to strengthen the strength of anti-aggression and to link with the Soviet Union, while also considering the opinions of Poland, Romania, and other countries. Another goal of British policy is to dispel Germany's so-called pretext of encircling Germany.

[London, Central News Agency, 2nd] During yesterday's meeting of the British House of Commons, members asked Foreign Undersecretary Butler whether Japan had notified the United States of the results of the recent German-Italian-Japanese talks. The Foreign Undersecretary replied no. In response to another question, he said that there were reports that Japan would also participate once the Axis powers were involved in the vortex of war. Foreign Secretary Halifax has paid attention to this. Another member asked whether what was reported in the newspapers was accurate. The Foreign Undersecretary replied that this was what was reported in the newspapers, and the government had not received a report.

[Tokyo, Reuters, 2nd] The "Kokumin Shimbun" here declared today that Japanese Ambassador to London Mamoru Shigemitsu warned British Foreign Secretary Halifax on the 27th of last month that the Japanese government was extremely concerned about Chamberlain's declaration that British-Soviet cooperation would extend to the Far East. It is heard that Shigemitsu also said that the United Kingdom's adoption of a united front with the Soviet Union in the Far East is the same as assisting the Chiang regime. Therefore, he requested that the United Kingdom abandon this policy. It is learned that British Foreign Secretary Halifax has replied that the British government has not adopted this policy and does not recognize the need to change the current policy towards China.

### Arab Brothers Sentenced to Death for Stabbing British Police Officer

[Jerusalem, Reuters, 1st] The military court here has sentenced two Arab Muslim brothers to death after a three-day trial for the recent stabbing of a British police officer. The British police officer was killed while performing his duties on April 19.

### British Industries Committee Announces Establishment of Committee to Conduct Industrial Promotion

[London, Reuters, 1st] The British Industries Association announced the establishment of a committee to find ways to promote British industrial news abroad and to consider how the association should assist the British government in conducting industrial promotion and promoting Britain's position in the world news community.

### French Foreign Minister to Visit Britain

[Paris, Haitong News Agency, 2nd] French Foreign Minister Bonnet is scheduled to go to Southampton, England, on the 12th of this month, on behalf of the French government, to participate in the Franco-British Friendship Festival, which is hosted by the French Federation to promote French culture.

### Belgium to Borrow from France

[Paris, Haitong News Agency, 2nd] Belgian Finance Minister Gutt and Commerce Minister Richard arrived here yesterday. According to political circles, the two Belgian political figures will conduct debt negotiations with the French Finance Minister to resolve Belgium's financial difficulties. In addition, diplomatic circles here are eager for the French government to agree to this loan, so that the friendship between the two countries will become closer. According to financial circles, if the negotiations are successful, it will also be a victory for French foreign policy and will enable neutral European countries to show sympathy for Western European democracy.

### Zetfield's Speech: Anglo-German Relations; If Germany Has No Plans to Invade, Britain Does Not Need to Guarantee Other Countries

[London, Haitong News Agency, 2nd] Minister of Defense Coordination Zetfield spoke last night, talking about Hitler's speech, saying that all British people should be comforted to hear Hitler's words admiring the British Empire. He also said that Germany actually misunderstood British foreign policy. Once war breaks out, Britain does not have to be Germany's enemy. Britain has indeed guaranteed the security of several countries, but if we are sure that Germany has no plans to invade other countries, then the British government does not need to guarantee any country. At the same time, Britain and Germany do not have to meet in battle, but Britain does not want to infringe on the independence and sovereignty of other countries.

### Roosevelt Asks Congress to Expedite National Defense Plans, Military Posts Established in Caribbean, Equivalent to Fortifying Panama Canal

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] President Roosevelt has requested Congress to expedite the implementation of national defense plans, and authorize the government to immediately allocate $20,650,250 to expand the Army Air Corps and strengthen the defense of the Panama Canal. Simultaneously, the government is authorized to allocate an additional $70,497,500 to increase the purchase of military supplies. The President also requested an allocation of $185 million to purchase Army aircraft and Air Force equipment, and further authorized the government to allocate $60 million to aircraft manufacturing plants to contract for the increased purchase of aircraft. These two items total approximately $250 million, which, added to the $50 million already approved by Congress, reaches $300 million. This will expand the strength of the US Air Force to 6,000 aircraft. Regarding the Panama defense budget, the original amount was $27 million, but the President now requests that $22 million be allocated for immediate use.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] The US Army Department has established military posts in the Caribbean Sea. This is tantamount to the United States establishing the first line of defense for the Panama Canal. President Roosevelt stated yesterday that the headquarters of the military posts will be located in San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico. According to the US Army Department, the establishment of the military posts is under presidential order. From July 1st, the military facilities on the US-owned islands in the Caribbean and nearby islands, such as the Virgin Islands (part of the US West Indies), will be managed by the military posts.

### Britain Announces Conscription Bill, Reserve Force and Supplementary Military Bill Also Released, Rapidly Submitted to Both Houses of Parliament for Review, Validity Period to Be Set at Three Years

[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] British Prime Minister Chamberlain formally gave the first reading to the Conscription Bill in the House of Commons yesterday. Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha also gave the first reading to the Reserve Force and Supplementary Military Bill.

[Reuters, London, 1st] The Conscription Bill, also known as the Military Training Bill, was released tonight and stipulates that the Navy and Air Force will also take a portion of the personnel called up for military service. It also authorizes the Navy Department to establish a special reserve unit to select personnel to join. The Air Force already has a special supplementary unit, so it is not necessary to establish another one. The bill stipulates that the British monarch may order the Cabinet to directly apply this bill to Northern Ireland and add some special provisions, but this will likely only occur during a special emergency or wartime. Irish citizens who "originally reside" in the United Kingdom, like citizens of other autonomous regions, are subject to the bill's constraints and may join the autonomous region's military. Those exempt from military service include: regular army personnel, those who have served in the military for six months seventeen years ago, those who have joined any reserve or supplementary force, and military school students. Approximately 200,000 personnel will be called up under this bill, to be summoned in four batches of 50,000 each. The bill also stipulates that employers should reserve the positions of employees called up for military service, with severe penalties for violators. There are also laws prohibiting the dismissal of employees approaching conscription age. If it is militarily necessary, privately owned land and buildings can be requisitioned, with procedures simpler than current ones. Those called up for military service will first train for six months, and then serve in the supplementary and reserve forces for three and a half years. Those aged 20 to 21 who have not registered for military service will be fined £5.

[Reuters, London, 1st] The Reserve and Supplementary Military Bill, recently released by the British government, simplifies the current legal procedures for calling up reserve forces. The bill authorizes the Navy, Army, and Air Force departments to call up reserve forces for defense when necessary, based on Cabinet orders. The Military Training Bill (i.e., the Conscription Bill recently passed) contains provisions for personnel allocation and penalties for workers who violate regulations. The Reserve and Supplementary Military Bill also has similar provisions.

[Reuters, London, 1st] The Military Training Bill and the Reserve and Supplementary Military Bill have now been rapidly submitted to both houses of Parliament for review without delay. The second reading of the Military Training Bill will be debated in the House of Commons on May 4th, at which time Chamberlain will deliver a speech. The validity period for both bills will be set at three years. If deemed necessary, it can be extended by a Cabinet order for one year, or repealed midway.

[Reuters, London, 1st] According to an official announcement, Northern Ireland Prime Minister Craigavon, at the invitation of British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Home Secretary Hoare, departed for London tonight to discuss several issues related to Northern Ireland in the current Military Training Bill.

[Reuters, London, 1st] The National Labor Congress has appointed a subcommittee to draft a reasonable declaration expressing the Labor Party's opposition to the current adoption of conscription.

### Japan Refuses British Woman's Visit to Hankou, British Government Investigating

[Reuters, London, 1st] In the British House of Commons today, Conservative Party member Mr. Moore asked, that Mrs. Unwin, a British national, has repeatedly requested to enter Hankou to meet with her husband, but the Japanese military authorities have consistently refused. What is the outcome of the Foreign Office's review of this matter? Foreign Under-Secretary Butler replied that the reasons for the Japanese authorities' refusal are still unknown and are currently being investigated. Mr. Moore then questioned, "Is the Minister aware that the Japanese side accuses Mr. Unwin of being anti-Japanese? After the Chinese army withdrew from Hankou, did Mr. Unwin not assist in removing the bombs buried by the Chinese army? Is this not sufficient proof that the Japanese claims of anti-Japanese sentiment are unfounded?" The Foreign Under-Secretary replied that the government will consider these facts when investigating the matter.

### Hull's Remarks: Germany Sends Hitler's Speech, Cannot Be Considered a Reply

[Reuters, Washington, 1st] Secretary of State Hull stated today that the German action of only sending a copy of Hitler's speech to the US Embassy cannot be considered a formal reply to President Roosevelt's peace telegram. Hull added that the German Foreign Office sent a copy of the speech to the US Embassy, followed by a telephone notification that this was the German reply. Hull also stated that regarding Romania's debt to the US war, he expects Romania to propose a solution within a few days.

Commentary

### President Chiang Kai-shek's "May First" Address

On May 1st, the National Spiritual Mobilization was universally implemented throughout the country, the National Covenant was strictly enforced, and National Monthly Meetings were held. The Supreme Leader President Chiang Kai-shek also gave a nationwide broadcast address, with earnest and sincere words that were inspiring and added to one's courage to fight for national and personal dignity.

We, who have escaped the bombing, robbery, rape, and pillage of the × people and are living under the power of foreigners, feel particularly moved and wish to especially bring the following three points to the attention of our overseas compatriots after carefully considering the leader's address:

First, President Chiang Kai-shek expressed deep concern for compatriots in the occupied areas. He also expressed deep respect and love for the arduous struggles of compatriots in the occupied areas. He said: "You endure hardship and persist in struggling to the death under the iron heels and violence of the × people, striving to uphold the various aspects of our Chinese national character. Every time I and all the soldiers and compatriots hear that you have killed a × person or burned a × product, we are more moved and happier than receiving news of victory from the front lines. Because your effect of killing a × person behind the × people's lines (that is, in our occupied areas) is greater than the effect of killing one hundred × people at the front!" These few words from the Supreme Leader not only make the people of the whole country pay more attention to and work harder in the battle behind the × people's lines; not only enable all the warriors in the occupied areas to work harder and redouble their efforts, but also can more seriously attack Wang Jingwei's poisonous plot of fighting guerrilla warfare after ×; and can also more solemnly point out the illusion of some reporters and people who underestimate the battle results in the occupied areas. In the future, we will not only add respect to the struggle of the Eighth Route Army in North China and the New Fourth Army in Central and South China, but also organize, enrich, and expand the vast rear of the × people with redoubled efforts.

Second, President Chiang Kai-shek expressed great sorrow for the young people residing in the concessions of Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou who dance around and wander without self-respect, and solemnly and earnestly declared to the whole country: "You should all know that you are a troubled and miserable orphan under the oppression of the × people, so you should be especially diligent and thrifty, hardworking and enduring, and especially take labor as your duty and service as your purpose. No matter where or when, you must be self-reliant and strong, and never be despised by the × people, but also be respected by friendly people." We believe that these words are like the admonitions of a loving father with blood and tears, and also like the admonitions to our compatriots living abroad, especially in Hong Kong. We know that in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and even Hong Kong, there are still many young people fighting for the motherland in hardship, and the situation is so moving and inspiring, but most of the "high-class Chinese" still live their extravagant and depraved lives without shame. The personal fall of such behavior is a small matter, but the damage to the reputation of the country and nation is great. Therefore, after carefully considering the leader's address, we not only hope that everyone will "repent if you have done wrong, and encourage yourself if you should," but also hope that everyone will use the power of organization and the power of public opinion to impose effective and strict sanctions anywhere and anytime. We must "not be despised by the × people, but also be respected by friendly people. And be able to improve the personality of our country!"

Third, President Chiang Kai-shek expressed infinite pain and anger at the actions of the × people and traitors, painfully stating that the × people "invade our China, rape, kill and burn everywhere, treating our Chinese people worse than cattle, horses, pigs, and dogs. This kind of humiliation is more painful than the hatred of killing a father." He further painfully stated that the traitors and pro-Japanese factions are doing the "shameless deed of selling out the country," "unable to face their ancestors above, and unable to face their descendants below." Therefore, he wants each of us to constantly ask ourselves, "Have you forgotten the great hatred of the × people invading your country and massacring your compatriots? Have you forgotten the shame of seizing your land, bombing your houses, killing your fathers, sons, brothers, and defiling your mothers, daughters, and sisters?" We men and women compatriots who have escaped from the bombing and looting of the × people, we overseas compatriots who have preserved our lives under the power of foreigners, we should follow the instructions of the leader. We should not only constantly reflect on ourselves!

Spiritual mobilization is not a idealistic empty talk, but a practical movement to mobilize the strength of the entire nation to support the war of resistance and national reconstruction. We must follow the leader's May 1st address, and we must use practical actions to support the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to resist Japan and build the country to realize the national spirit. Every compatriot who is unwilling to be a slave must not only do this himself, but also make the people around him do this! (Lang)

### An Unprecedented Feat in the Hong Kong Drama Scene, The Great National Revolutionary Historical Drama "Huanghuagang" Premieres Tonight, Three Consecutive Nights at the Taiping Theatre, Three Hundred Actors, Fundraising for the Relief Association to Support the Families of Fallen Soldiers

Special Report by This Newspaper: The seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang rang the blood bell of revolution with their lives. In order to fight for the freedom and liberation of the people, they had the heart to bid eternal farewell to their parents, wives, and children. Although the martyrs are dead, their heroic spirit will last forever. When we recall the passing of the martyrs, how tragic and moving it is, causing us to shed tears. Amidst the emotion and tears, we sincerely admire the spirit of sacrifice and struggle of the martyrs, and we heartily realize how heavy the task of those who survived is!

But what is the Republic of China that the Huanghuagang martyrs created with their blood and heads like? Rampant corruption, internal strife, and external remorse are unbearable to look back on. If the martyrs were aware, how could they rest in peace under the nine springs? This historical grievance and blood debt, until the start of the war of resistance, was finally thoroughly settled by our heroic soldiers with blood and heads.

Look! The heroic soldiers in the war of resistance are comparable to the martyrs of Huanghuagang, who came before. In order to rebuild China and "fight for national freedom and liberation," they finally "had the heart" to "bid eternal farewell to their parents, wives, and children." Only we who steal our lives and enjoy the fruits of their labor, only we who still have parents, wives, and children to look after, how ashamed should we be, how ashamed! In order to slightly reduce the unease within, in order to atone for one in ten thousand, performing "Huanghuagang" to raise funds to comfort the families of soldiers killed in the war of resistance is such a meaningful event.

Everyone knows that the Huanghuagang Revolution is the most tragic and greatest historical event of the Chinese nation, and is the prelude to this sacred war of resistance. The completion of the "Huanghuagang" revolutionary historical drama is the unprecedented work of twenty-two former writers. Today, when the war of resistance is in full swing and the light of victory is already shining in front of us, performing "Huanghuagang" to praise the spirit of the martyrs who gave up their lives to achieve benevolence and spread their names to future generations is intended to raise funds to comfort the families of soldiers killed in the war of resistance -- their parents, wives, and children whom they had the heart to bid farewell to -- in order to comfort the spirits of the martyrs in heaven and to encourage those who are alive to move forward on the bloody path. This is indeed the duty that we who are alive cannot shirk.

Under this great and sacred call, the Hong Kong All Circles Relief Association has painstakingly shouldered the heavy responsibility of hosting the performance. More than thirty drama troupes and more than three hundred backstage workers in Hong Kong have achieved unprecedented unity and are dedicating themselves to the drama for the sake of the country and to comfort the dead. More than twenty choral groups, totaling one to two hundred singers, will perform the magnificent songs together with the great "Huanghuagang" -- all the newspapers in Hong Kong have broken new ground and unanimously published special editions to promote the performance with advertisements. All of these are unprecedented efforts and unity, writing a fresh page in history in Hong Kong.

"Huanghuagang" was originally scheduled to be performed on the Flower Festival, but due to insufficient preparation and review arrangements, it was decided to perform it at the Taiping Theatre for three consecutive nights, starting today. This can further symbolize that although the Huanghuagang flowers have fallen, our memories and admiration for the martyrs will forever linger in our minds.

"Huanghuagang," a great revolutionary historical drama in four acts and six scenes, has more than one hundred actors. Together with the backstage workers, there are more than three hundred people, making the scale of the performance grand and the content wonderful, which goes without saying. The complexity and realism of the props and costumes also go without saying. This unprecedentedly great script, unprecedentedly great performance, unprecedentedly great unity, unprecedentedly great lineup, and unprecedentedly great service, how worthy are they of our praise and respect!

The directors Ouyang Yuqian, Hu Chunbing, Zhong Qinan, Huang Lin, Lu Dun, Tan Guochi, and other pioneers of drama movement, are all well-known experts in the drama world. For a month, they have carefully designed, diligently led, and directed without sparing any effort. The main actors of the China Travel, China Art Times, and other drama troupes have all taken on the leading roles in "Huanghuagang." The other actors are also the best chosen from various drama troupes in Hong Kong. Tonight's performance is bound to be a resounding success.

For more than a month, the play has been actively rehearsing at South China Middle School and China Art Troupe. The work is proceeding very intensely. The Relief Association's "Huanghuagang" Performance Special Committee has painstakingly prepared all the arrangements and is ready. A final preview will be held at the Taiping Theatre at noon today. Now, only one question remains: we, the Japanese compatriots in Hong Kong, must enthusiastically watch "Huanghuagang."

The ticket prices are set at four categories: five dollars, three dollars, one dollar, and thirty cents. Considering the strength of each person's contribution, how can there be any excuse to refuse? The martyrs shed blood to fight for national freedom and liberation, and the actors and workers have been working tirelessly to prepare, forgetting to eat and sleep. We have the opportunity to see the most advanced theatrical art and to receive the rare opportunity to be baptized by revolution. Is there still any room for stinginess?

Remember, remember, remember, starting today for three consecutive nights (7:30 PM to 12:00 AM) the premiere of "Huanghuagang," the greatest revolutionary historical drama at the Taiping Theatre. Remember, remember, remember, this is to raise money to comfort the families of soldiers killed in the war of resistance.

### Good News Amidst the Firewood Shortage, Two Thousand Tons of Vietnamese Firewood to Be Shipped to Hong Kong, A Firewood Merchant Writes to Taikoo Bureau to Charter Ships, Hong Kong Authorities Agree to Waive Taxes and Lend Land for Storage

Since the Japanese invasion of South, the transportation between Hong Kong and the mainland has been cut off, and the firewood supply on which this place depends has also been severely affected. The market price has suddenly soared, with only fifty odd catties per dollar. When Jiangmen fell, the problem became even more serious. Therefore, the general residents are all calling out in pain, and merchants in Nanyang and Vietnam, seeing the profit to be made, are flocking to Hong Kong to sell. It is noted that a Vietnamese gentleman surnamed Huang recently transported 2,000 tons of mountain firewood to Hong Kong, but because the quantity was too large, there were not enough ships for transportation at one time. Yesterday, he specially wrote to the Taikoo Ship Bureau to discuss chartering ships. It is reported that the merchant has been granted permission by the Hong Kong authorities to borrow land for storage and waive various taxes. After the batch of firewood arrives in Hong Kong, it will definitely be sold at a low price, and the firewood shortage problem in Hong Kong can be largely solved.

### Waters Near Humen Head, Firewood Boat Robbed, Eight Thieves with Sharp Weapons, One Thief Holding a Hand Grenade, Firewood Valued at 1300 Dollars Looted

The waters bordering China and England have always been a den for pirates. Recently, due to the current situation, pirates have become even more active and rampant. Ships traveling between Hong Kong and the mainland are often robbed by pirates mid-journey. At 3:00 PM yesterday (1st), another firewood boat registered with the Hong Kong Ship Administration Office, No. 1261, was robbed by nine pirates in the Chai Zhou waters off Humen Head. Yesterday morning, the boat owner, Zhang Yao, returned to Hong Kong and went to the Shau Kei Wan Police Station to report the case. According to him, he left the Chinese boundary on the morning of the 1st of this month, fully loaded with firewood, totaling ninety-four piculs, intending to transport it to Hong Kong for sale. At 3:00 PM that afternoon, when he sailed to the Jiangzhou waters opposite Humen Head, he suddenly saw a pirate boat flying over. The boat was carrying nine pirates, eight of whom were holding long and short guns, and the other was holding a grenade. They shouted for our boat to stop. I and my companions saw that the thieves were all holding murder weapons and were extremely fierce, so we had to obey and stop to avoid misfortune. The pirate boat drove alongside our boat, and eight thieves boarded the boat and threatened us, forcing us to drive the boat to the shore, driving us ashore, and the thieves drove our boat away. We had no choice but to return to Hong Kong on foot. The loss was ninety-five piculs of firewood, worth $150, the boat itself was worth $1200, and several sets of clothes were worth $3, totaling $1353. The duty officer at the station, upon receiving the report, immediately filed the case and telegraphed the various district bureaus to search for the culprits.

### Residents Attention! Cholera Strikes Hong Kong Again, Free Cholera Vaccinations

"Cholera," the prevalent epidemic in the Far East, has struck Hong Kong again. In order to prevent the spread of cholera, the local health authorities have launched a prevention campaign, urging citizens to get vaccinated quickly and pay attention to diet, especially drinking water, milk, fruits, vegetables, fresh fish, and ice cream, to avoid infection. Due to the dense population, the spread of cholera is particularly worrying in Hong Kong. In the past two years, there have been as many as 1,446 deaths, a shocking number. The symptoms of cholera are abdominal pain and vomiting, and the only way to prevent it is to be careful with your diet. The validity period of the vaccine is limited to only five months.

Citizens who wish to be vaccinated can go to the following locations, where doctors will vaccinate them free of charge. The free vaccination locations are as follows: Queen Mary Hospital, Old National Hospital, Tung Wah Hospital, Tung Wah Eastern Hospital, Kowloon Hospital, Kwong Wah Hospital, 105 Third Street, Medical Bureau in Western District, Shek Qu Lane, Wanchai Medical Bureau, Ap Lei Chau Street Central Public Medical Bureau, Shau Kei Wan Hospital, Gansu Street Yau Ma Tei Medical Bureau, Kwun Yum Street Hung Hom Medical Bureau, Medical Bureau Street Sham Shui Po Medical Bureau, Kowloon City Medical Bureau, Mrs. Bay Health Center, Central Fire Station, Kowloon Old Government Affairs Bureau, Yuen Long and Tai Po Medical Bureau.

### Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce Issues Annual Report Yesterday; The Number of British Rubber Shoes Shipped to Hong Kong is Astonishing; Totaling Over 5.4 Million Pairs Last Year; British Manufacturers Severely Affected and Unable to Compete

The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce issued its annual report for last year the day before yesterday, with a detailed report on the Hong Kong rubber shoe industry. It stated that the British rubber shoe industry had been quite prosperous since 1924, but was later hit by the dumping of Japanese goods. After the government imposed heavy import taxes, Japanese goods were unable to be sold. However, after the Japanese goods were frustrated, Hong Kong rubber shoes took the opportunity to be exported to Britain. Hong Kong products, due to preferential tax treatment, were much cheaper in price, and British products were unable to compete with them. This year, British manufacturers sent a representative, [Mr. So-and-so], to Hong Kong to try to reach a gentleman's agreement with Hong Kong manufacturers to voluntarily limit the amount of imports so that British products could regain some market share. Otherwise, British manufacturers, for the sake of their own interests, would take action to cancel or change the preferential tax treatment. The report stated that between 1934 and 1936, Hong Kong shipped about 2 million pairs of rubber shoes to Britain. By 1937, it had increased to 4.54 million pairs, and from 1938 to September, it had reached 5.428 million pairs. British manufacturers were even more panicked as a result. After the British manufacturers' representative arrived in Hong Kong, they further demanded that Hong Kong products increase their prices by one-tenth and voluntarily limit the amount of imports for a period of two years, with the annual amount decreasing: 4 million pairs of summer cloth shoes, 500,000 pairs of raw rubber crepe-soled shoes, 250,000 pairs of rubber shoes, and no other rubber shoes to be imported. In the opinion of the Chamber, this condition cannot be accepted because the British rubber shoe industry is more affected by high-quality Canadian shoes and less affected by Hong Kong shoes. However, the committee believes that maintaining price levels is beneficial to both Britain and Hong Kong. The report also advocated that Hong Kong manufacturers should control production.

### Major Theft Occurs on Peel Street; Over 600 Hong Kong Dollars Stolen

A resident surnamed [So-and-so] of the second floor of 162 Peel Street, Sai Ying Pun, reported to the police station yesterday morning that at around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, while he was sound asleep, thieves broke in and stole HK$850 by opening the safe. He requested that the case be filed and investigated.

### Tragedy Occurs at the Queen's Hotel Yesterday; Two Young Women Commit Suicide by Poison; One From Macau, One Quietly Arrived; Lysol Sent Two Souls to Heaven

A tragic suicide by poisoning occurred at the Queen's Hotel on the third floor yesterday. It was found that a traveler named Liao Zhen (28 years old) from Room [So-and-so] on the third floor of the Queen's Hotel at 159 Des Voeux Road Central had checked into the hotel the day before. She only had a swimming basket as luggage. She said she was from Macau. Before the incident occurred, the traveler had shown no other signs, so the waiter did not pay attention to her. It was not until about 5:00 PM yesterday that a young woman named Liao visited her. At 6:30 PM, the hotel manager noticed that there was no sound in the room, suspected something was wrong, and called for the door to be opened. However, after several minutes, there was no sound. The hotel manager informed the hotel owner and broke down the door. When they discovered the two women, they were already dead. The people in the hotel reported the incident to the police station and asked them to send a hearse to take the two bodies to the public mortuary. According to the people in the hotel, the two women committed suicide by taking Lysol.

### Mr. He Xiangning Writes a Special Poem for This Publication… Special Issue on the Joint Performance of 'Huanghuagang' by the Hong Kong Drama Community; A Lesson: The Performance of Huanghuagang

— Cai Chusheng

Under the auspices of the Hong Kong All-Circles Relief Association, more than 30 organizations and more than 300 drama workers have been mobilized to raise funds to comfort the families of fallen soldiers on the front lines by performing the great revolutionary historical drama "Huanghuagang." This is not only an unprecedented feat in Hong Kong, but also a rare event in mainland China, such as in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hankou, where drama workers have gathered in large numbers in the past!

We should especially point out that the significance and role of this joint general performance are not only to raise a sum of money to fulfill some of the responsibilities that our rear-area people should fulfill, but also a work of epoch-making significance in the Hong Kong drama and cultural movement.

We know how difficult it has been in the past for Hong Kong drama workers to establish a sound overall organization. This deeply reflects that our work still retains various unnecessary concepts of "sects," "factions," and "boundaries," which have led to division and fighting on our own. This will cause great damage to the entire drama movement.

Perhaps some people say that it seems too early to demand unity of will, consistency of pace, and organic coordination with the needs of the objective environment, with the most sensitive actions, rapid reflection, and rapid results from the Hong Kong drama and cultural movement, which is just beginning to sprout and has not yet fully entered its vigorous period. Perhaps there are some reasons for this. However, in our contact with some of the mechanisms of various drama groups, in addition to many things that deserve our respect and need not be said, it is also easy to find various errors in content and form. Works such as "art for art's sake," "love for love's sake," and "feudal consciousness" are still being staged, and the techniques of "civilized drama" (I have seen a few small theater groups that are indeed suspected of having this problem) are still being used. The existence of these shortcomings not only makes it impossible to "thrive," but also kills the "sprout." As for its role—effect—it is naturally directly proportional to this. How worthy of attention this is!

In "peaceful times," perhaps we can "each do what we see fit" and let them develop in a scattered manner. However, in the current situation, everything is changing so rapidly that we need to turn all cultural tools into effective weapons at all times. Even a country bumpkin who has received a few days of training as a conscript wants to go to the front line. We really have no time to wait any longer! In the sacred struggle for national freedom and liberation, apart from traitors and [Japanese], even enemies can be known as confidants. What's more, there are erroneous concepts of "sects," "factions," and "boundaries." Therefore, in addition to singing the praises of this performance with the greatest respect, I also sincerely hope that this great performance will enable the various drama fighting units to have a better understanding of each other, a better understanding of the road ahead, and to break down some unnecessary prejudices, and to continue the spirit of this great gathering, and to quickly establish a sound overall connection!

We know that the progress of all cultural departments is due to criticism and supervision. We cannot let errors continue. We cannot let those who have made progress stop because of "satisfaction." We cannot let the scattered status quo remain scattered. We should have strict collective criticism and supervision. We want to use the flowers of drama in Hong Kong, which was once a "deserted island," to go from "sprouting" to "thriving" to "flourishing" under a rigorous collective action!

In addition to paying the greatest respect to the workers who participated in this performance, I also hope that the performance of "Huanghuagang" will be a milestone in the era of Hong Kong drama and cultural movement! Written hastily on the night of May 2nd.

### Starting From the First Performance of Huanghuagang in Guangzhou

— Situ Huimin

A year ago, when Huanghuagang was first performed in Guangzhou, I happened to catch up with that heated atmosphere. Time passed quickly, more than a year ago. At that time, the warm taste of spring in the south was no different from before, and the sky above the tomb of the Huanghuagang martyrs. Maybe it's still the same now? However, the heated situation at that time can only be deeply left in our memories now. In the past year, the war of resistance has shifted from the first stage to the second stage, Guangzhou has fallen, and Huanghuagang and the place where Huanghuagang was first performed have been occupied by the enemy. If that theater has not been bombed into ruins now, perhaps the [Japanese] are grinning and having fun there. A year, a full year, the impression is still clear. When Huanghuagang was first performed in Guangzhou, playwrights from Guangzhou and playwrights who worked in Guangdong from various places participated in the writing of that great historical drama together. Under extremely rapid and excellent work, the script was produced and all the actors in Guangzhou participated in the performance, mobilizing a large number of citizens to participate in this performance meeting. That day, March 29, 1938, the evening of the anniversary of the martyrdom of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang, there was a torch parade in the city. The Taiping Theater in Xijiayuan performed this meaningful Huanghuagang. Under the threat of bombing by [Japanese] planes, the alarm had not yet been lifted, and our drama began to be performed amid enthusiastic applause from the audience. How many times in the history of Chinese drama movement can we get this large-scale and united performance? This drama showed the citizens of Guangzhou more than 20 years ago the great difficulties in creating the Republic of China with the sacrifice of the martyrs' hot blood and heads, and inspired the citizens of Guangzhou to defend the results created by the elite martyrs in times of crisis, and to defend the glorious land that promoted the voice of revolution. That day, during the performance of Huanghuagang in Guangzhou, the audience enthusiastically shouted, "In order to commemorate the spirit of the 72 martyrs, we must step up the defense of Guangdong!" But a year, a year later today, we commemorate that lost glorious land in deep grief, and the heated situation of Huanghuagang's performance in Guangzhou in mournful memories also makes us miss the respectable Guangzhou theater comrades who participated in the work at that time. Now they are either sacrificed under the bombing of the [Japanese] to defend that glorious land, or dispersed to various places, hoping to spread the undying seeds of drama everywhere, so that the spirit of great unity among drama workers can grow in the war of resistance.

Huanghuagang was brought to Hong Kong and taken over by the theater workers staying in Hong Kong for performance. This time, it is also a large-scale and united performance in Hong Kong. It includes all the drama workers in Hong Kong, as well as comrades who participated in the first performance in Guangzhou. Its significance should not be less than that of last year. The more fierce the [Japanese] attack, the more we can only strengthen the meaning of drama. When it was first performed in Guangzhou, we shouted, "In order to commemorate the spirit of the 72 martyrs, I will step up the defense of Guangzhou," but at present, a year after its first performance, the drama significance should be "In order to commemorate the spirit of the 72 martyrs, we must step up the counterattack against the enemy, and win back that lost glorious land, step up the counterattack against the [Japanese], and win back the theater where Huanghuagang was first performed, and wash away the shame of the [Japanese] insulting the martyrs' graves. I hope that the drama work comrades and the overseas Chinese compatriots staying in Hong Kong will encourage themselves with this united performance.

This year's performance of Huanghuagang also has a point that should be especially clarified. When Huanghuagang was performed last year, our anti-[Japanese] camp was still sneaking in traitors and [Japanese] who were disguised as patriots [censored]. They hung up the signboard of the old revolutionary party and deceived everywhere, acting as lobbyists for the enemy. But now this conspiracy has been broken, and Wang [Jingwei] embarked on the path of China's national revolutionary struggle in the same era as the Huanghuagang martyrs, but the martyrs sacrificed themselves [censored], glorious sacrificers, to make the Chinese people live a more tragic life of slavery than in the Manchu Qing autocratic era. Now everything has been revealed. When we are performing this Huanghuagang heroic epic in Hong Kong, these national revolutionary traitors who are plotting to sell out the party and the country are fleeing the borders of the war of resistance. Now they are carrying out large-scale activities everywhere, communicating with the [Japanese] publicly and semi-publicly. In order to strengthen the significance of the performance of Huanghuagang, we should especially clarify this significance to the overseas Chinese: In order to commemorate the spirit of the 72 martyrs, we must step up the eradication of traitors who betray the martyrs and sell out the party and the country, traitors in disguise [censored].

This large-scale and united performance of Huanghuagang in Hong Kong. Its significance in the drama movement goes without saying. This time, it created a historical record in the history of Chinese overseas drama performance. It can only be realized in the current stage and era of the war of resistance. In the past, there was a lack of contact between theater workers, and various private opinions were maintained between the people and individuals, and between groups and collectives. However, these shortcomings have been improved in the course of the long-term war of resistance. This performance, combined with the initial Guangzhou Huanghua Two performances in history, makes those who cannot unite abandon their former relationships. The drama work comrades should carry forward the valuable fact and consolidate it with blood. May 1, late at night.

### Also an Example

— Xia Yan

The moment I knew that friends in the Hong Kong drama circle were planning to stage "Huanghuagang," I didn't want to be pretentious, I couldn't get rid of a vein of dim, unbearable memories. Is the situation at that time last year not as clear as yesterday? And this year, dozens of people gathered to create the "Huanghuagang" script on the third floor of the Guohua Bank on Yonghan Road, and hundreds of people busy rehearsing in the Education Association Auditorium, those little friends who were busy nailing the scenery that once appeared, that one attracted tens of thousands of viewers The Taiping Theater, and even the master of this script—the tomb of the 72 martyrs who signed the Guangdong revolutionary spirit, are they not all occupied, dispersed, and trampled on by [Japanese] hooves?

However, the revolutionary spirit of Guangdong will not disappear because of temporary failures, setbacks, and occupations. The comrades who created and performed "Huanghuagang" are not to mention on the front lines of Guangdong, and those who have temporarily retreated to Hong Kong are still continuing to take the weapon of drama to [censored]? The main tactic of the second phase of the battle is to "attack the heart." Although "Huanghuagang" is not a complete work of art, it has a sharp use in the tactics of [censored] "attacking the heart."

In the moment before victory is about to arrive, we will often encounter the most difficult, the most unbearable environment. The martyrs of Huanghuagang used their own flesh and blood to break through the temporary difficulties and expressed to the national public an example of the confidence that the revolution will succeed. Use this example to combat all those who attempt to surrender and change their stance in times of difficulty.

### "The Chinese Are Indeed Geniuses"

— Gao Changsheng

For the staging of "Huanghuagang," Mr. Lu Fu asked me to request Mr. Guo Moruo to write an article, but timing-wise, it's already too late. "The Chinese Are Indeed Geniuses" is an article written by Mr. Guo for the Chongqing premiere of my humble work "One Year of Carrying," but the content broadly discusses Chinese drama and culture, so let's publish this article once in Hong Kong. Xia Yan. May 1st.

"The Chinese are indeed geniuses," these were the words of an old Japanese writer, Akita Ujaku, to me.

It was the spring of the year before last, when I was still living in Tokyo, Japan. Some of the students studying abroad were going to perform Qu Qiubai's "Sunrise." Playing the female lead was Miss Feng Hezi, who had just graduated from Fudan University and was going to Japan to study.

"Sunrise" was performed for a total of three days and was greatly welcomed by the Japanese. Miss Feng's photo was printed in almost every newspaper.

I went to see it on the second night and happened to meet Akita Ujaku, who was also watching it for the second time. He said to me very sincerely:

"The Chinese are indeed geniuses. A play of such a grand scale as 'Sunrise' is rarely seen in Japan, especially with an actress like Miss Feng, whom Japan has never produced."

I said to him, "Miss Feng is still a student."

"Yes," he replied immediately, "I talked with her for a long time last night, so the Chinese are indeed geniuses."

His white hair rippled with his sincerity.

Soon after, the Lugouqiao Incident occurred. I returned to Shanghai at the end of July and have been there for nearly two years. I have seen "Wu Zetian" in Shanghai, "The Death of Li Xiucheng" in Hankou, and "Long Live China," "Phoenix City," "National Glory," and "Battle" in Chongqing. I feel that these plays are even more advanced than "Sunrise," and the actors' skills have improved rapidly.

Every time I watch a modern drama, I always recall the conscientious old writer from Japan, and even more, I recall his sincere words to me.

Yesterday, I crossed the river and saw the rehearsals for "One Year" by my friends at the dormitory of the Central Photography Studio. Seeing the tireless efforts of my friends, the moving nature of their actions and voices, I couldn't help but think of Akita Ujaku and his words again: "The Chinese are indeed geniuses."

People like Akita Ujaku, who can see the merits of the Chinese as if they were their own, are extremely rare among the Japanese. Let me take Miss Feng Hezi as another example.

Miss Feng originally planned to study in Japan and pursue further education, but she couldn't bear the persecution of the Japanese and finally ran back before the Lugouqiao Incident occurred. She herself had complained to me many times that soldiers and military police were always bothering her there, always disbelieving that she was a student, always saying that she was a professional actress, and even suspecting her of being a female spy using acting as a smokescreen. When she went to Atami for hot springs, even going to the toilet and entering the bath were followed. Therefore, she really couldn't bear it and gave up the idea of studying abroad.

I consider this as—as "giving an example" to prove that we Chinese are indeed geniuses, while the Japanese who generally harbor ill intentions towards China are jealous of us and do their best to hinder our development.

But we must not be discouraged in the slightest, nor should we be complacent. We Chinese are not only geniuses in acting but are also endowed with genius in every aspect. With genius, we must strive to develop it. Having genius but being unwilling to work hard is exactly what the malicious Japanese are secretly hoping and praying for.

Friends, let us all make a resolution and work hard diligently. We must provide various achievements to contribute to human culture, so that people all over the world will say with sincere conviction:

"The Chinese are indeed geniuses!"

### The Opening Act of Struggle

— Fei Mu

Romain Rolland wrote "July 14th" for the French Revolution; we Chinese have "Huanghuagang."

No country's revolution, like China's, after overthrowing the autocratic court, established a republic, liberating China from the rule of the fewest nobles among ethnic minorities; at the same time, it is carrying out thorough reforms in various aspects of society and culture. Guiding China onto the path of building a modern nation, and evolving to today's vigorous national unity for independence, freedom, equality, and resistance against Japan to build the nation, these twenty years of consistent revolutionary flames.

The fighting spirit and the raging revolutionary flames sprang from the red blood of the seventy-two martyrs of the Xinhai era.

On March 29th of the second year of Xuantong, the first torch of revolution was lit. This torch still illuminates all of China and the entire world.

This illustrates the fighting spirit and irrepressibility of the Chinese nation.

The Huanghuagang martyrs were only seventy-two in number, but after these seventy-two martyrs, countless unknown heroes sacrificed themselves for the revolutionary struggle of the country and the nation. In today's war of resistance against Japan, this spirit of sacrifice has been carried to the extreme.

In the long span of twenty-eight years, no matter how vicissitudes change, China has always been advancing towards the bright path, and no labor can stop it.

The public performance of "Huanghuagang" contains much of the meaning of expressing the martyrs and commemorating the national revolution; but it cannot be seen merely as a historical drama, because it is still a historical fact of our time, an opening act of a national liberation struggle: (Most of the revolutionary predecessors who participated in the March 29th Uprising are still alive today.) In the psychological time, that is, at the starting point of history, it is as fresh and relevant to reality as national defense dramas such as "Taierzhuang" and "Eight Hundred Heroes."

Grateful to be able to see the performance of "Huanghuagang" at this time, and wishing it success. May 1st, in haste.

### Editor's Note

— Lu Fu

In just a few days of extreme haste, I finally finished editing the fourteen "Huanghuagang" special issues. Although I could barely get two or three hours of sleep each day, and although I was in extreme busyness and fatigue every day, facing these over 700,000 words of work, thinking of this unprecedented lineup, unprecedented unity, and unprecedented service, I was deeply moved and unaware of fatigue.

### Continue

— Lu Jiao

The organization of a united front for all Hong Kong drama workers has undergone several meetings and discussions. But unfortunately, each gathering has become a waste, and the result is always no follow-up and dispersal!

This time, thanks to the call of a day with great historical significance and the sincere cooperation of comrades, this unprecedented feat was indeed accomplished. This is worthy of joy and celebration!

This pioneering initiative is indeed unprecedented and has its significant meaning, but it is only a large-scale joint performance. The entire unified organization has not yet been established. This is not only an imperfection but also a major regret!

If we frankly and without concealment review the working process of this joint performance, we cannot help but feel the disorganization, the lack of close contact between the various departments, which affects the slowness of work development. This is because there is no sound unified organization.

Especially at present, the drama movement in Hong Kong is developing vigorously, and the organization of drama troupes is constantly increasing. This is certainly a gratifying phenomenon. However, on the other hand, several larger professional drama troupes are struggling in extreme hardship due to the limitations of theaters and other objective conditions. From this situation, we can see that drama in Hong Kong has not yet achieved a stable social position and has not gained a wide audience. These are always serious problems for the future of drama, and these problems cannot be solved by one or two groups fighting alone, because this is the problem of the entire drama industry, which must be solved by the joint efforts of all workers. Then, for the future of the drama movement that is rising and developing, for establishing the status of drama in society, especially for the decision of the road ahead... a unified organization is indeed necessary and urgently needed!

Although this joint performance has its shortcomings in organization, it is because all the workers have a clear understanding of the meaning of this work and hold the same purpose, so in the process of working, they are still very affectionate, close, and harmonious, which is the most pleasing thing.

However, today is the performance, and in two days, the work will be finished. Then this temporary organization will end and disintegrate, and from now on, the harmonious and affectionate emotions of the past ten days or so will also be lost and can never be regained. This is a very regrettable thing!

Therefore, I hope that this joint performance will not stop at the first joint performance, but hope to continue to maintain the spirit of unity this time, and immediately establish a sound and permanent unified organization. I firmly believe that all the workers who participated in this joint performance will have this requirement!

The final victory of the War of Resistance will surely belong to us, and similarly, the future of drama will also be bright!

### The Story of the National Revolutionary Historical Drama "Huanghuagang"

— Hu Chunbing

The great revolutionary historical fact of Huanghuagang has been inscribed for eternity. What is written in the play is only a "dramatic" part, the poetic truth.

Premier Sun, from the year of Yiyou when China was defeated in the Sino-French War, resolved to overthrow the Qing court and create a republic! After the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, there was the Guangzhou Uprising of Dingwei, and after the Eight-Nation Alliance entered Beijing in Gengzi, there was the Huizhou Uprising of the same year; the background is self-evident. After that, there were the Pingli Uprising, the Huanghuagang Uprising, the Huizhou Uprising of Yiwei, the Qinlian Uprising, the Zhennanguan Uprising, the Hekou Uprising when the chieftain's war slave mother and son died, the Anqing Uprising, the Guangzhou Uprising, and the Gengxu Guangzhou New Army Uprising, all of which had the background of the Three Principles of the People, that is, stimulating the vigorous advancement of the Three Principles of the People. All party members adhered to this principle, preceding and succeeding each other without the slightest discouragement. The Russo-Japanese Entente was formed, and thus there was the Guangzhou Uprising on March 29th. The Huanghuagang martyrs' willingness to die as if returning home was all under the influence of this principle, without any difference. However, it was carried out by party members from one or part of one province. After that, it was carried out by party members from home and abroad. Moreover, the elites of the party sacrificed purely for the principle, which was even more shocking to the country, making the people unanimously support the revolution. Before a year passed, the Republic of China was declared. Therefore, this battle can be said to be the Huanghuagang martyrs sacrificing for the Three Principles of the People, that is, using the spirit of sacrifice of the Huanghuagang martyrs to spread the Three Principles of the People among the people, and the Republic of China was able to be created. On March 10th of the Xinhai year, on the day when the flying boat was demonstrated in Wuhan, Wen Shengcai, who had returned from Nanyang, was preparing to assassinate Governor Li Zhun.

Wen Shengcai: Lao Huang, what exactly is going on?

Huang Xiayi: Last night, the headquarters held an emergency meeting and decided to postpone the launch.

Wen Shengcai: Postpone? Today is already March 10th, when is it postponed to?

Huang Xia: March 28th.

Wen Shengcai: So late.

Wen Shengcai, filled with righteous indignation but lacking training, couldn't wait any longer. After the flying boat exercise was over, he saw a sedan chair of a high-ranking official coming and, thinking it was Li Zhun, rushed up and fired several shots. The person in the sedan chair was dead, and he was captured when he ran out of bullets.

Sedan carrier B: (To the commander) Reporting to the lord, Lord Fu has passed away.

Wen Shengcai: What, Lord Fu?

Defense Army: Haven't you heard of General Fuqi?

Wen Shengcai: What? Wasn't the person sitting in the sedan chair Li Zhun? ... Haha, Li Zhun, Li Zhun, consider yourself lucky. Poor Fuqi, you became Li Zhun's scapegoat; haha... Well, although it was the wrong person, killing one more traitor and one more Han slave will rid China of one less pest (Prologue)

Wen Shengcai sacrificed himself. At 8:00 a.m. on March 25th, in the secret agency at No. 8 Ganjiaxiang, Yu Peilun was making bombs, and the female comrades were working enthusiastically together. Some revolutionary comrades were waiting for Huang Keqiang's arrival. There were eight agencies in Xiguan—twelve in the eastern district. Eight in Henan. It is already has more than seventy guns, but the pioneers are eight hundred people. The large amount of military equipment transported from Japan and Annam will arrive on the 27th, they are going smoothly—at the same time, Comrade Yin Xuzonghan came to report that the governor's office ordered a house-to-house search of the entire city within five days, and the New Army will be transferred away at the beginning of next month.

When the Manchu police came to search, the female comrades all pretended to be Comrade Yin's family members. They got away with it! It was only because a list was in Chen Jingbo's hand that it almost caused the entire group to be wiped out.

Just as the crisis passed, someone knocked on the door. It turned out to be Lin Juemin's wife, who had come from afar to find him. For the sake of revolution, for the sake of work, he could not see his passionate and deeply affectionate wife. He could only avoid her, letting Peilun and Zhuo Yanxing fob her off.

Huang Keqiang came and gave everyone hope and courage. In the debate over whether to start the uprising sooner or later, he said, "In all things, when it is time to do something, there must be a great determination, that is, either succeed or perish," then there will be a harvest. If we postpone it again today, it would be equal to disbanding ourselves. How can we face the Premier in the future, how can we face our compatriots overseas? If everyone does not have the determination, I am willing to fight Li Zhun alone to apologize to my comrades." So everyone decided to start the uprising on the 28th (First Act)

In another camp, late at night on March 27th, in Zhang Mingqi's foreign-style flower hall, maids and male servants were flirting. Zhang Mingqi returned with his advisor Huang Guocai. Another scene reported that revolutionary party members smuggling military equipment had been arrested. He was wondering why the revolutionary party members could not be completely captured and killed, but the second madam came out and disagreed, for the sake of the adults taking care of their health. At this time, Admiral Li came to see him, explaining the serious situation and discussing the strategies to deal with it, "While the New Army is definitely investigating, send people to inspect the barracks in the name of inspection. When they go, they can take down the grips of the guns in the barracks one by one, and also order a house-to-house search throughout the city, strictly guarding against insurgents."

A traitor came to inform them. They learned of the news of the uprising on the 28th. Zhang Mingqi was so scared that his legs went weak. Li Zhun decided to transfer Wu Zongyu's patrol battalion back to consolidate the provincial capital, stationing two battalions to guard the Longwangmiao Heights, and the rest guarding the ships along the Jinghaimen River (Second Act)

Turmoil and tension.

At about 7 p.m. on the 28th, in another revolutionary agency, many male and female comrades were transporting military equipment. Lin Wen, Lin Yinming, Lin Juemin, Yu Zenglun, Zheng Kun, and Song Yulin mentioned the matter of the New Army being disarmed on the evening of the 29th.

Lin Juemin: That's right, victory will definitely be ours even if we ourselves are sacrificed. - In order to achieve victory, our sacrifice is necessary. As long as we have the determination to sacrifice, even if we fail this time, the impact on the general public will be indelible!!

Zheng Kun: Whoever is afraid of sacrifice is not worthy of being a revolutionary.

Huang Keqiang arrived and said that he had received a telegram from Hong Kong to start the uprising on the 30th. He had already replied that it was too late to change, and it was still set for the 29th. However, Hu Yisheng reported that the military equipment transported by a group of female comrades was seized. Chen Jiongming also came to report the news that two battalions of patrol troops had been transferred and three sentries were sent to guard the Longwangmiao Heights. Everyone asked to postpone it, and Huang Keqiang also agreed with anger and pain.

Xu Zonghan and Yu Peilun rushed over, and Li Wenfu and Lin Juemin were all in favor of starting the uprising as scheduled.

Huang Keqiang: Okay, then we will decide like this. Concentrate our strength and attack the governor's office tomorrow. We want to complete this glorious page in history.

Yu Peilun: The opportunity has reached the final moment. If we don't succeed, we will perish. We are all determined to die. There is no room for consideration now.

Huang Keqiang: That's right, if we don't succeed, we will perish. In order to achieve national liberation, in order to strive for the realization of the Three Principles of the People, we cannot hesitate in the slightest. We will not hesitate to sacrifice everything. We will use our blood, our flesh, and our heads to build a glorious monument.

At 5:30 p.m. on March 29th, while Zhang Mingqi and Li Zhun were interrogating revolutionary party members Chen Meixin and Rao Guoying in the Governor-General's Office, the revolutionary party members attacked. Zhang Mingqi and Li Zhun fled in panic.

Because of insufficient strength, many revolutionary party members were killed or injured. Huang Keqiang, Zhu Zhixin, and others were urged by their comrades to leave. Li Wenfu and others were arrested when they ran out of bullets. The seventy-two martyrs sacrificed heroically.

On October 10th of the same year, the Wuchang Uprising was successful and the Republic of China was established. (Fourth Act)

On March 29th of the twenty-eighth year, our overseas compatriots held a memorial meeting for the Huanghuagang Uprising. "Dear compatriots, comrades, after twenty-two months of the national self-defense war, we have progressed to a more serious new stage! To accelerate the victory of the War of Resistance, we must do our best to thoroughly complete the mission entrusted to us by the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang and the Premier! A new China is about to be reborn. The spirit of the Huanghuagang martyrs will never die! Long live the Chinese nation! Long live the Chinese nation!" (Epilogue)

Especially under the banner of South China, there are many talents. In past championship competitions, they have achieved outstanding results and were able to win the championship.

### English Middle School Inter-School Sports Meet: La Salle Wins the Overall Championship, Diocesan Boys' School Wins the Second Place, Central British School Wins the Third Place; Guo Tongxiong Breaks Old Record in Pole Vault

The Hong Kong English Middle School Inter-School Sports Meet held its finals at the South China Athletic Association Stadium at Caroline Hill yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. A total of nine schools participated: Queen's College, King's College, Central British School, Diocesan Boys' School, St. Joseph's College, St. Stephen's College, Wah Yan College, La Salle College, and St. Paul's College.

If he works hard, the results will definitely be more than this. He is a promising talent. The athletes of La Salle College bravely crowned the entire stadium, winning a total of 30 points, and winning the Governor's Shield and the Paul Chater Cup.

### Britain Actively Seeking to Host Next World Games; International Olympic Committee to Meet in June to Carefully Select Representatives and Vie for Hosting Rights

[London Correspondence] The British Olympic Committee has recently been actively seeking to host the 1944 World Games in London. It is reported that they are quite confident of securing the right to host the next World Games.

The British side has been preparing extensively for the selection of personnel to attend the International Olympic Committee meeting, which opens on June 6, to ensure that the representatives are appropriate and that it is advantageous to secure a vote for the location of the next World Games during the meeting.

The International Committee will be held at St. James's Palace in London. King George was originally scheduled to hold the opening ceremony, but due to his tour of Canada, the Duke of Gloucester will represent him instead. The British side has planned a number of activities involving the royal family and social circles. Therefore, it is predicted that cities such as Detroit in the United States, Switzerland, Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, or Rome will not be able to compete with London.

For the 13th Winter Olympic Games, Oslo in Norway and Montreal in Canada are both hopeful. Oslo could have obtained the 1940 Winter Olympic Games, but the World Ski Championships were also held in Oslo at the same time, so it had to concede to Switzerland.

Recently, the Mayor of London has officially written to the International Committee requesting to host the next Games and guaranteeing all funds. The British Olympic Committee also pointed out that London has not yet officially received the right to host the Olympic Games, even when it was held in London in 1906, it was only taken over by London because Rome suddenly gave up.

### Tonight's Men's Basketball: Eastern vs. Star Island; Even Strength Makes a Fierce Battle Inevitable; Second Division: Chun Cao vs. Taikoo, Pui Ying vs. South China

Three public men's basketball games will be held tonight (3rd) at the YMCA gymnasium. The first game, Second Division, is at 6:30 pm, Chun Cao vs. Taikoo; the second game, First Division, is at 7:30 pm, Eastern vs. Star Island; the third game is at 8:30 pm, Pui Ying vs. South China. Eastern is a strong team in this year's competition, with exceptional strength. It has many talented players, such as Feng Nianhua's breakthroughs under the basket, Sun Baoqing and Chen Zongqi's interceptions and long shots, which are unique skills. Huang Dingfen is also capable of both long-range and close-range attacks. Zhong Guoneng and Luo Jilian are able to coordinate well. In addition, Xu Hengnan has returned from his expedition, reorganized his team, and his momentum is even more exuberant. However, Star Island also has strong players. In an exhibition match, they once defeated Eastern, which shows their strength. Moreover, their combat experience is particularly good at detours and breakthroughs, and they utilize a man-to-man strategy. Zai Luncheng, Liang Guoduo, and Li Peiyan are all able to overcome obstacles and defeat generals. Xin Yalang and Lu Zhenxuan are also able to shoot accurately. Li Shichi and Pan Yaojun's sneak attacks under the basket always achieve success. The meeting of the two armies today will inevitably lead to a fierce battle. As for who will win, it is difficult to predict. In the Second Division game, Chun Cao vs. Taikoo, although Chun Cao is not a strong team, their fighting spirit is quite admirable. Taikoo is slightly weaker, and victory may not be easy to obtain. In the Pui Ying vs. South China game, Pui Ying's fighting power is quite strong. Since their debut, they have been invincible. South China is also a strong army in this year's competition and has been defeated once, but its strength has not disappeared. The two armies will hold each other tonight, and there will be a fierce battle, but Pui Ying's offense and defense are consistent, and they have a chance to win.

### Youth Association Organizes Elementary Basketball Training Class; Starts on the 11th of This Month

### Jianquan Cup Match: Amateur vs. Wah Hung Rescheduled

The Jianquan Lin Table Tennis Competition, the preliminary round ended successfully last week, leaving a good impression in the minds of people from all walks of life. It is found that the skills of the players are becoming more and more sophisticated and in line with science. For example, the rackets are changed to the rubber boards used by the champions, which are also very proficient. There is a tendency to improve by leaps and bounds. It is found that there is still one game left in the competition. Because the Amateur and Wah Hung teams of the 918 group have both lost three games, and the points are equal, the two teams will have another final to determine who will win the final. The association originally scheduled the final for tonight, but the Amateur team happened to coincide with the Three Banks Cup on Sunday, and the tournament must be held on time and they cannot be in two places at once, so they requested a change. Wah Hung has agreed. The association has approved their request and has now finalized the final to be held at its holy meeting at 7:30 pm on the 5th of this month. The two teams have their own experts, and who will win or lose is impossible to judge. The public will draw lots to form groups at the school's ballroom at 8:30 pm that evening.

### Without Violation

— Ya Lu

Not violating the Three Principles of the People, not violating government laws and decrees, not violating the interests of the nation and the people. These are the opening three of the twelve national covenants in the Outline of the National Spiritual Mobilization. Anyone who holds the meaning of the National Spiritual Mobilization will certainly not ignore these three issues.

For conditions that are beneficial to the country and the people, there are no violating actions, which can be considered a good citizen. However, Weger said that only reaching the level of non-violation seems insufficient during this period of resistance. We must go further to earnestly implement the Three Principles of the People, government laws and decrees, and things that increase the interests of the nation and the people.

However, if we want to implement these three tasks, we must have a deep understanding of them. First, we must know that the Three Principles of the People is the doctrine of national salvation, because its goal is to seek national liberation, second is to seek the freedom of civil rights, and third is to seek the equality of people's livelihood. At present, the most important work in China is the war of resistance for national liberation. Once the nation is liberated, the freedom of rights and the equality of people's livelihood can be easily solved. However, if we want to implement the Three Principles of the People, we must recognize the status of our country, enhance our national consciousness, and have a spirit of loyalty to the country, loyalty to the cause, and loyalty to the people, and contribute our talents and money as much as possible to the struggle for national liberation.

The second point concerns the government's laws and decrees, which not only must not be violated but must also be implemented to the best of our ability. The National Spiritual Mobilization Law is the most urgently needed to be implemented at this stage. Chairman Chiang has already said: "After the war of resistance entered the second phase, the enemy was already in a military dilemma, becoming more and more embarrassed and more and more bewildered day by day; recently, the enemy has focused on political manipulation, fabricating facts, and alienating the people, in order to subdue our spirit first, decompose our spirit, and then conquer our entire nation..." Therefore, with this National Spiritual Mobilization Law, it should be enough to inspire the people's ambition, increase the people's understanding of the country, strengthen the people's belief in victory, and invigorate the people's spirit of resistance, so that the enemy's political conspiracies, shaking and anesthetizing methods cannot be used.

The third point is to implement the issue of enhancing the interests of the country and the nation. Placing personal interests above the interests of the country and the people is really a selfish concept. The ancients said: "If the skin is not there, what will the hair attach to?" This means that the people and the country have a relationship of interdependence. If the country is destroyed and cannot survive, the people will not be able to enjoy the benefits of living and working in peace, and will be treated as slaves. Therefore, the interests of the country should be regarded as higher than everything else. China is now fighting for survival in the war of resistance. We should concentrate our efforts on doing all work that is beneficial to the country. Because after the country is restored, the people will enjoy endless benefits.

The war of resistance will surely be won, and the founding of the nation will surely be achieved. We must earnestly implement the National Spiritual Mobilization, not only without violation.

### Many Roads

— Ding Di

When sailing in the winding Qujiang River, with many islands and turns, or on an ancient road without carriages, with many crisscrossing ruts, a traveler is often saddened by the many roads due to not being able to distinguish east from west.

It is not a straight and smooth road, without road signs, without maps, without anyone to guide you, and the sky is very gloomy, and a mountain rain is about to come, with dark clouds filling the sky. You cannot climb high and look far, nor can you observe the details. You will have no intention of being calm and composed, standing alone on the crossroads. The livestock are tired, and people are hungry and thirsty. Lest you are robbed by bandits, lest you entrust yourself to wolves and tigers, you should take a break and find your lodging for tonight. Therefore, you have to choose the road you should take from several crossroads.

Everyone has their future, and everyone has a "break" point. The livestock are tired, and people are hungry and thirsty, and dusk is approaching, so you cannot stand still at the crossroads or sleep in the wilderness. Therefore, travelers each support with poles and oars, feed the horses and grease the carts, each climbing the hillside, crossing the plain, rushing to the shoal, surrounding the harbor, and each encountering adverse currents and favorable winds, difficulties and smoothness, dark roads and sheep intestines, life, death, misfortune, and happiness.

The road is unpredictable. It is difficult to predict your comfort and hardship based on the flatness and danger in front of you. A smart and upright traveler must not forget his future for the sake of temporary comfort.

The many roads also determine the fate of many paths. Often a happy road is buried in thorns, and an evil road is full of pulp. Friends, how will you choose your path?

Will you drink that pulp? Or will you let the thorns pierce your feet? There is no happy road from the beginning, no unsweet olive, no eternally peaceful life. Life, a reverse journey of heaven and earth, isn't it also a variable crossroads? The torment of poverty, the whip of power, the sweet enticement of profit, often make you lose your own opinion. You cannot calm down and take care of your honor and disgrace, your life and afterlife, your ancestors and descendants. Therefore, you enjoy the sweet pulp and abandon the thorns.

The sadness and happiness in front of you are all illusory. Short-sighted people cannot see through the illusion, so they each experience the current sadness and joy.

Sadness and joy are often impermanent. The current success is inevitably the future frustration. A smooth road to success is to fall into a mud pit; greedily drinking pulp is to kill yourself with poison; people who are full of confidence in sleeping safely at night are also buried in wolves and tigers, with a stupid smile still remaining on their lips. Greed and temporary comfort have been exchanged for cruelty and misery.

Changes happen in an instant, is there any change less than that of many roads? Happiness, misery, darkness, light, righteousness, evil, crisscrossing, all placed in front of you, allowing you to choose. Each road has its own destiny. The road is many-forked, and the fate is also many-forked. Let you choose. You can take disaster because of this, or you can gain blessing because of this, you can also leave regrets for thousands of years, or you can leave a good name for generations.

Perhaps you clearly know that you are heading for your future, but you are afraid of taking the thorny road ahead. People are tired, hungry, the road is long, the body is cold, there is nothing to wear and eat, there is nothing to play with, you can't help but be powerless, and you can't help but be tired. Naturally, you can't help but steel your heart and say fiercely, let's do it recklessly, so you embark on the evil road, you say it is for life.

That's right, everyone has to live. Stepping on the evil road, you are living now. Not only living, but also being able to indulge in evil, you are proud of the present, but have you ever looked at that distant, Soshan and the other side? Can you point out to me the joy beyond those few arrows, the final ending?

You are delighted with color, can I not be saddened?

So I shudder, open my eyes, and focus on the high places and the distant forces: I recognize the confused roads. Finally, I find that there are only two: the present suffering and the present joy.

I look for a mountain peak again and see higher and further, and what I see is still two: eternal suffering and eternal joy. The current suffering and joy are not the same as eternity, but are opposite.

The many roads also determine the fate of many roads. Choose, you and I should be on the road.

The mountain rain is about to come, and dark clouds fill the sky. Dusk is approaching again. Isn't it when you are hungry, tired, and swaying?

Many roads, difficult to identify in the vastness, you must be cautious about where you go.

### Package

— Dongfang

Knowing that the Propaganda Team Leader wants to invite him to go on patrol outside the city in the first month, Zhou knows that he is very unwilling. Then, he takes a bowl of white fungus soup, and keeps stirring it with a wooden silver spoon, staring blankly at the white, hot air in a daze. Aunt Wang leaned against the door, watching with interest. She reached out and turned off the light switch with a "pat", and the room immediately went dark. Zhou was startled, pushed the bowl to the table, stood up and wanted to hide. Suddenly, he heard a series of delicate laughter, and then he knew it was Aunt Wang. Then the lights came on again, and he sat down again. Aunt Wang fluttered over, dressed in flowery clothes. Zhou picked up the bowl again, and said, both angrily and affectionately:

"These kinds of jokes can't be made. The police chief was just assassinated, and my life is hanging in the balance. Don't you just know how to mess around..."

"Don't say that. Who told you to take this smelly job!" Aunt Wang leaned over, opened her mouth, her pink face was white and red, and then asked: "Is it sweet enough?"

Zhou handed over a spoonful tremblingly, and sent it to Aunt Wang's mouth. Zhang Ma lightly called from outside the door: "Master."

Zhou pushed away Aunt Wang in a hurry, put down the bowl, and asked solemnly:

"What's the matter?"

Zhang Ma solemnly held a paper package, walked to the side of the table, and handed it to Zhou with both hands. Aunt Wang took it, but immediately put it on the table, and said with a sharp mouth:

"Oh, it's so heavy!"

Zhou inspected the package while listening to Zhang Ma.

"The doorman sent it in, saying it was sent by a young man. When he asked him if he wanted a receipt, he said no, no, turned around and left."

A young man, not wanting a receipt, with no words on the package, and so heavy. He shook his head carefully to understand the rope, but the rope was tied so tightly that he couldn't untie it for a while. Aunt Wang was impatient, and rushed over to tear it, heavy-handed and heavy-footed. Zhou became anxious and quickly held Aunt Wang's hand:

"Gently, gently, be careful it's a bomb."

When Aunt Wang heard this, she was so frightened that she withdrew her hand and rushed over to hug Zhou, her pink face changed color, writing to Zhang Ma:

"Why didn't you ask clearly where it was sent from? What's inside? You just held it in so confused..."

Zhou frowned, stretched out his finger and wanted to untie the knot, and kept saying:

"Don't make noise, don't make noise, what's that! If it's not a bomb, won't people laugh to death! If it spreads to the team, they will have more to ridicule. The fight room is also absurd, why didn't you ask clearly?"

Aunt Wang blocked him with both hands, not allowing him to move, and the two of them wrestled into a ball.

Suddenly, the telephone on the wall rang. Zhang Ma went up to answer it, raised the microphone high and called:

"Master, it's a call from Counselor Zhao from Zhao's residence."

Aunt Wang jumped up, let go of Zhou, rushed over, took the microphone, pressed it to her ear, and said while panting:

"Oh, it's you, yes, it's me... Who sent it? What?... Da Ting's braised beef?... Okay, okay, I received it, but I haven't opened it yet. Why didn't you bring it yourself?... Oh! Okay, is Master there? He's asleep..."

Zhou rushed in, and she had already hung up the microphone, and patted Zhou's shoulder while laughing, and said:

"Xiao Zhao came from Beijing and brought Da Ting's braised beef. He asked his nanny to send it to his son. That child is inexperienced, so he put it down and left without asking for a receipt. He was worried, so he called to ask."

Zhou breathed a sigh of relief, and Zhang Ma understood. She took the white fungus soup bowl and quietly withdrew.

### Burial

— Liu Lan

A vast curtain of night was pulled from the edge of the sky, obscuring the entire wilderness. The firmament was like a black, boundless sea, without a single star, not even a sliver of moon, all submerged in the depths. Cold, desolate, and silent, only the chill of the night stirred.

This place had once been a fertile field, exuding fragrance. Golden rice ears swayed in waves of abundance. Mornings and evenings, wisps of blue smoke rose from the thatched roofs, slowly blending into the milky white morning mist and crimson twilight. Gurgling streams meandered around the dwellings, a tranquil, peaceful village.

Now, lying silently are crumbling walls and broken tiles. The rugged earth emanates a musty, rotten smell, tinged with the stench of blood. Even the sound of the wind seems to wail. The world is buried under the heavy weight of death.

A group of dark figures slowly moved toward this place, like a small snake, stubbornly crawling, finally coming to a halt. Resting by a small stream, there were about thirty or so men. Carrying assorted rifles, Arisakas, Mausers, and various other weapons, they wore different kinds of clothing: military uniforms and short jackets. They had different faces: square ones, round ones. However, their hearts were not "each as their face." Belief and will had forged the brothers into a single piece of steel. Struggle was the anvil, tempering them to be purer and stronger.

"He's dead," the two comrades at the rear of the group placed down a crude stretcher, touched the wounded man, and uttered these two simple words. Their tone was somber and low, flowing through the night sky. The news twisted everyone's faces, causing spasms of grief. Pain lodged in the hearts of all the men, like crows perched on a tower in the setting sun, but not a dazzling sunset, rather a desolate, deep night. Suddenly, the black door of death opened, snatching away another tenacious soul, one who had been playing with death all day.

Silence enveloped the group, no one spoke. Three comrades silently dug a pit, shoveling away the earth, as if scraping away at their own hearts.

The biting night wind caressed their faces, like playful, unknown insects, making them drowsy. But these men remained still as bizarre rocks. Excessive grief had numbed their senses.

Under the solemn gaze of more than a dozen pairs of eyes, the martyred warrior returned to the earth. He was buried. Resentment burned in the hearts of the living. Sparks of revenge burst forth in their minds.

"Today, in a battle, a comrade sacrificed himself. The death of a partner certainly makes us sad, but sacrifice is inevitable. We must have the courage to face death. Freedom and liberation must be exchanged for blood. For the eternal survival of the nation, we will not begrudge individual lives. Comrade ×'s death is glorious, great," the captain suppressed his own emotions, saying each word forcefully and resolutely. "We should commemorate the fallen comrade with a more tenacious and sustained struggle!"

A white dove fluttered its wings in his heart, wanting to fly out of his chest. The final sentence stirred the dove's wings, tempting it to fly.

In the deep night scene, the figures moved forward again, finally disappearing into the endless darkness.

From the distant sky, the sharp sound of gunfire cut through the long night's silence.

### Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

In order to interrupt her notion of buying a newspaper, he had no choice but to respond to her friendly teasing with friendly jest.

"Am I some kind of 'Miss' that I can act high and mighty?"

"Who are you kidding, who's a 'Miss'? You can't not tell me today!"

She erupted with childishness; this childishness was a deliberate attempt to be endearing. In front of her, he also deliberately pretended to be a child, saying:

"I just won't tell you today, I want to see what you can do to me!"

"I'll do whatever I want to you, you don't believe me, just try me!"

"You dare!"

"See if I dare, I must make you afraid of me this time!"

"Me afraid of you? Hmph, I'm afraid you'll cry!"

"Damn you, will you say it or not? Who are you calling 'Miss'?"

"You, you!"

"I'm not, I'm not, not a hundred times!"

"You're not? Then you just ask people to buy a newspaper for you so casually!"

"Then I'll go out and buy it myself, will you read it?"

He blocked the doorway with his hand, teasing her. She pushed him a couple of times, unable to break through, so she simply punched him and went back. He asked:

"You got your money's worth this time!" (55)
