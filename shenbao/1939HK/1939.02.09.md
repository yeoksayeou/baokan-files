### Repelling the Japanese ×'s Political Offensive

Japan's invasion of our country has encountered difficulties in its military progress. Consequently, it has had to resort to political conspiracies to orchestrate peace, attempting to divide our country's anti-Japanese front and weaken our resistance. The goal is to end the war on conditions of victory. This would not only allow them to digest the benefits they have already gained, but also dismantle our country's unity, returning our internal affairs to the state of division before the war. This would then provide them the opportunity to engage in further aggression. Though this conspiracy has been repeatedly shattered by our country's strong anti-Japanese front, it has not only persisted to this day, but has intensified proportionally to the increasing difficulty of Japan's military progress.

Since the anti-Japanese war entered its second phase, Japan's military operations in China have not only made no progress, but have become increasingly bogged down. To attack the Northwest, they were defeated once in Western Shanxi and again in Southern Shanxi, their attempts to cross the river becoming mere pipe dreams. To open the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, they have been stalled in both the north on the border of Hunan and Hubei, and in the south at Huaxian Xin Street. To attack the Southwest, they have been unable to cross Beihai and Sanshui. Meanwhile, in various guerrilla zones, our guerrilla forces are exceptionally active, launching attacks at any time and any place, leaving them exhausted from responding and in a dilemma between advancing and retreating. Moreover, since the start of the war, Japan's domestic finances have been drained, with runaway inflation, soaring prices, and widespread suffering. Anti-war sentiment is rising, with many university professors arrested for opposing the war. The Communist Party has also launched large-scale anti-war movements among the people of Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. These facts have made Japan's rulers acutely aware of the disadvantages of a protracted war with China. They have thus resorted to orchestrating peace as a way to survive in a dead end. On the one hand, they took advantage of the British ambassador's inspection of North China, using the names of North China mass organizations and non-official celebrities to issue telegrams calling for peace. On the other hand, they used the "Axis of Germany and Italy" to send Matsuda, a member of the House of Peers, and Kurazono, a member of the House of Representatives, to China to approach the Italian ambassador to China, asking him to mediate the Sino-Japanese War. At the same time, Germany, eager for Japan to achieve victory in China, spread the smokescreen of "German-Soviet amity" and the impending demise of the "Anti-Comintern Pact" in Chongqing, attempting to sow discord between Chinese-Soviet friendship and relax our country's resistance efforts.

The reason Japan wants to take advantage of the British ambassador's inspection of North China, using fabricated names to telegraph for peace, is not only to divide our country's anti-Japanese front, but also to try to change the perceptions of third countries towards China's resistance. This is because Britain has recently taken a more active stance on our country's resistance. It has not only been consistent with the United States and France in protesting Japan's violation of international treaties and the forceful occupation of foreign interests in China, but has also provided loans to our country for economic assistance, dealing a considerable blow to Japan's invasion of China. Therefore, it has had to fabricate facts to confuse public opinion, hoping to reduce British sympathy and assistance to our country. However, the people of North China are well aware of its treacherous schemes. In addition to sending telegrams to the whole country to reveal its conspiracies, they also sent letters when the British ambassador arrived in Tianjin, declaring their unwavering support for the National Government's resistance to the end and that they have no absurd illusions of calling for peace, in order to dispel falsehoods and correct public perception. As for its conspiracy to use the "German-Italian route" to lure a few wavering elements in the anti-Japanese front who do not understand the great cause and disregard the facts to divide our country's unity, thereby making it impossible to continue the resistance, it is also a fruitless endeavor with no effect. This is because after Wang Jingwei and others ××, those who advocate the "German-Italian route" have temporarily disappeared from sight, not daring to show their faces.

For nineteen months, the hard sacrifices of our people have made it clear to the entire nation that to achieve national liberation, we can only achieve our goal by uniting and resisting until the end. Our country is fundamentally an oppressed and invaded nation. This resistance is entirely out of unbearable oppression and aggression, and we have risen up to defend ourselves. It is also for the sake of national survival and national liberation that we have made a great and painful decision and embarked on the path of resistance. War is self-defense, and not fighting is surrender, is submission, is leading oneself to destruction! Now, the prospect of our country's victory is becoming brighter day by day. Building a mountain requires nine trips filling baskets with dirt. How can we be willing to stop short of success? We deeply hope that all Chinese citizens will develop a spirit of hard and unyielding struggle, and promote and assist the government. Domestically, we must step up the political mobilization work of unity and cooperation among all anti-Japanese parties and groups, accelerate the improvement and progress of political, military, party affairs, and people's movements, and intensify economic construction in the rear and the rear's × combat force. Externally, we must thoroughly eliminate the "German-Italian route" of capitulationists, strengthen the close cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union, and strive to win more practical and extensive assistance from the democratic countries of Britain, the United States, and France. Only by doubling our efforts to apply these principles of internal and external struggle to repel the Japanese ×'s political offensive can we ultimately and most thoroughly defeat the × invaders!

### The Youth National Salvation Movement in Chaoshan

— Zhang Wenqiang

Recognizing the severity of the national crisis and unwilling to be slaves of a fallen nation, the youth of Chaoshan launched a national salvation movement among the people of Chaoshan even before the July 7th Incident. Because the government's national policy of resistance had not yet been decided, the political environment did not allow the vigorous development of the people's national salvation movement. The activities of the youth in Chaoshan appeared in a vague and obscure manner. Many youth groups, such as the Shantou New Script Research Association, the Esperanto Society, the Hai Chao Drama Society, the Literary Symposium, and the current affairs discussion groups of various school groups, all aimed to unite youth, train youth, educate the people, awaken the people, and prepare them to shoulder the arduous task of saving the country when the great era arrived. When the Shantou Hai Chao Drama Society was preparing to organize, regarding the issue of the name, someone proposed "National Defense Drama Society." At that time, everyone thought that the meaning of the two words "national defense" could best express the content of the work and was the best possible name. However, the environment did not allow us to talk about national defense. What we feared was that people would know too much that we were doing national salvation work, so everyone agreed to adopt a more neutral name. The decision of a drama society's name may be a small matter, but it fully illustrates how the youth of Chaoshan at that time were working hard in a difficult environment to promote the national salvation movement. After about a year of silent growth, the national salvation movement of the youth of Chaoshan had laid a fairly solid foundation.

Before the war of resistance, the national salvation organizations of the youth of Chaoshan all died young due to the oppression of the harsh environment. However, the youth of Chaoshan constantly innovated, and after one organization disintegrated, another new organization emerged. After the Xi'an Incident, Chinese politics began to improve, and youth activities were relatively free. Therefore, the Literary Symposium, which began to be organized in the spring of 1937, still existed when the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred and continued to develop. After the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, the Literary Symposium immediately expanded and transformed into the Shantou Youth National Salvation Comrades Association—later renamed the Youth Anti-× Comrades Association—becoming the core of the vigorous youth national salvation movement in Chaoshan since the war of resistance.

The Chaoshan youth national salvation movement is the backbone and essence of the entire Chaoshan people's national salvation movement. The scope of activities of the youth of Chaoshan is not limited to Chaoshan. In the northwest, southeast, and various battlefields, there are heroic youth from Chaoshan studying and fighting. The Chaoshan Youth National Salvation Movement deserves attention!

Widespread Expansion and Unification of Organizations

The Shantou Youth National Salvation Association was established not long after the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred. The anger of national hatred that had been brewing in the hearts of general zealous youth since the September 18th Incident for six years seemed to have obtained sufficient nourishment. It immediately ignited a strong flame, and all gathered under the flag of the Youth National Salvation Association, working hard and loudly calling for action, setting off a climax of the Shantou Youth National Salvation Movement.

Shantou is the center of Chaoshan's economy and culture. Any social movement that occurs in Shantou will have a leading and driving effect on the entire Chaoshan region. The climax of the Shantou Youth National Salvation Movement quickly spread to the entire Chaoshan region. The organizations of the Youth National Salvation Comrades Association were established in various counties in a short period of time. Now, the organizations of the Youth Anti-× Association are widespread in counties, districts, townships, and towns. The youth of Chaoshan have already been organized.

At the beginning of the war of resistance, only a small number of youth with a relatively high degree of political awareness and a relatively strong patriotic enthusiasm participated in the Chaoshan youth anti-enemy organizations. The members of the Youth National Salvation Associations in each county and city numbered only forty or fifty, and at most two hundred. The total number in Chaoshan was less than three thousand. Although they were all youth with a considerable level of knowledge and a considerable level of working ability, and their performance was also quite good, and they promoted the people's national salvation movement to a considerable extent; however, there were still many youth wandering outside the national salvation circle, unable to follow the ranks of advanced youth, and move together towards the great road of national liberation, which inevitably buried the precious youth power, and was a shortcoming in the Youth National Salvation Movement. Filling this shortcoming is the urgent task of the advancing national salvation youth.

When the flames of the war of resistance resounded throughout the country, why couldn't the youth of Chaoshan on the national defense front unite together to prepare to repel the approaching × invaders? Subjectively, it was because the style of the advanced youth made mistakes and did not pay attention to attracting backward youth... Objectively, it was because the environment had not yet improved greatly, and the evil forces hindering youth activities still existed.

After the shortcomings were exposed by the facts, everyone felt that they should be overcome immediately. The youth of Chaoshan had a shortcoming in the past, that is, their attitude to work was too advanced. Not only did it make it impossible for peasant and worker youth to approach, but also most of the intellectual youth with slightly weaker enthusiasm, because they did not receive the power of attraction, thought that they could not keep up with others, and did not want to keep up with others, and stayed outside the national salvation circle. A part of the advanced and enthusiastic youth, like a locomotive that had derailed from the train, moved forward by leaps and bounds. Although its speed was fast, its effect was small. However, it also seemed like a commando team that had broken away from the main force. The more it rushed into the × formation, the more it felt the isolation of its strength. It could not help but slow down slightly. Only by cooperating with the broad team can it overcome the current great ×. When the Youth Anti-× Associations in various places in Chaoshan held a representative conference last August 13th, reviewing the members of their own teams, they were only a part of the advanced intellectual youth. The vast majority of young people had not yet joined the ranks of national salvation, and they deeply felt that they were in a dangerous situation of fighting alone. Therefore, they immediately decided to attract the vast masses of youth and expand the organization of the association as an important task for future work. After August 13th, the Youth Anti-× Associations in various places in Chaoshan were working hard to expand the organization of the association. Although the objective environment had only made some progress, and the forces hindering the youth movement still existed, after the subjective weaknesses were considerably overcome. The ranks of national salvation youth have already been rapidly expanded. The Shantou Youth Anti-× Association has grown from 200 to 600 members, and the number of members of the Youth Anti-× Association in Chaoshan has surged to over 15,000.

In the war of resistance, the responsibility of the youth is not only to enthusiastically shoulder the anti-war work of various departments, but also to mobilize tens of millions of peasant and worker masses to bravely rush to the battlefield of national liberation. Although the ranks of the Chaoshan national salvation youth are gradually becoming broader and stronger, the vast peasant and worker masses, who are the basic force for protracted resistance, have not yet been mobilized. It has only done the work of enriching its own strength, and it is still quite far from the true goal of the national salvation movement—arousing the broad masses. Therefore, expanding the organization to factories and fields, and closely linking youth with the peasant and worker masses has become the current working policy of the Chaoshan youth to expand the organization.

The organization of the Chaoshan youth national salvation organizations was very scattered and unsystematic at the beginning. There was no unified leading agency above the counties and cities. Within a county. The County Youth Anti-× Association was not connected to the District Youth Anti-× Association, and the District Youth Anti-× Association was not connected to the Township Youth Anti-× Association. Each Youth Anti-× Association was an independent unit, only subordinate to the local People's Anti-× Support Association, and slowly under the leadership of the Support Association. Therefore, the comrades of the Youth Anti-× Associations in various places were fighting alone. There was only spiritual connection between each other, not organizational connection, and only spiritual leadership, not organizational leadership. The Shantou Youth Anti-× Association, whose work performance was relatively good, has invisibly become the leading agency of the Chaoshan Youth National Salvation Movement. However, this leadership is unsound. (To be continued)

### Most of the Yarn Factories in the Occupied Areas Have Been Robbed by ×, and the Distribution and Sale of Yarn and Cloth in the Area Is Also Monopolized, Resulting in Huge Losses to the Coastal Textile Industry

[Shanghai Correspondent] Chinese yarn factories are mostly concentrated in a few coastal cities and have suffered the most from the impact of the war. The factories in the war zones have been robbed for refusing to cooperate, and machinery and equipment have been moved without permission. The goods produced by Chinese factories in the concessions rely entirely on consumption in the southwestern provinces. The sale of yarn in the Japanese-occupied areas is monopolized by the Japanese, and cotton is also subject to unified distribution and sale. The details are as follows:

Thirty-Eight Yarn Factories in Operation

Yarn factories in operation in Shanghai: (1) Chinese: Shenxin No. 2 Textile Factory, Shenxin No. 9 Textile Factory, Xinyu No. 1 Factory, Xinyu No. 2 Factory, Hongzhang Textile Dyeing Factory, Yong'an No. 3 Factory, Tongyi Textile Company, Qinfeng Textile Factory, Datong Yarn Factory Limited Company, Heji Zhenye Yarn Factory, totaling 12 factories with 354,272 spindles, 31,360 thread spindles, and 1,700 cloth looms, accounting for 32.3% of the original yarn factories. (2) British: Jardine Matheson, Ewo, Yangshupu, Lun Chang, etc., 4 factories with 4,976 spindles, 3,640 thread spindles, and 3,265 cloth looms. (3) Japanese: Nichiwa, Shanghai, Naigaimen, Donghua, Tongxing, Gongda, Dakang, Toyota, Yufeng, etc., 24 factories with 1,114,316 spindles, 290,824 thread spindles, and 14,554 cloth looms.

Consumption of Chinese, British, and Japanese Yarn

The goods produced by Chinese, British, and Japanese factories are entirely dependent on consumption in the southwestern provinces for the Chinese factories. The British factories supply their own weaving factories in Shanghai. Japanese yarn is priced lower than Chinese and British yarn and is supplied to various weaving factories in Shanghai for sale in the occupied areas. The transaction volume of spot yarn in Shanghai in November last year was 2,050 bales to Yunnan, 1,994 bales to the inland, 1,586 bales to Shantou, 1,315 bales to Dalian, 219 bales to Ningbo, 350 bales to the Northern Gang, 394 bales to Fujian, 80 bales to Wenzhou, 52 bales to Quanzhou, 40 bales to Yantai, 40 bales to Sichuan, 85 bales to Jiangxi, 25 bales to Southeast Asia, 35 bales to Haiphong, 6,208 bales to the Four Banks, 10 bales to Luzhou, totaling 14,483 bales.

Raw Material Control and Soaring Prices

The raw material for yarn factories is cotton, which is usually purchased from the cotton-producing areas of Jiangbei and North China. Now, because the above-mentioned areas have fallen into enemy hands one after another, the puppet "North China Provisional Government" and the puppet "Central China Reformed Government" have been ordered by the Japanese to implement unified control over the distribution and sale of cotton. Therefore, the raw materials required by Chinese yarn factories are quite difficult to obtain. Although the cotton harvest in various places last year was abundant, it was all controlled by the Japanese and transported to Japan and the leased territories of Kwantung, Korea, and Taiwan, etc., with a total value of approximately 89,897,717 yuan in national currency. The price of cotton, such as the average price of Huoji cotton in November last year, was 52 yuan 89 cents, the average price of Lingbao cotton was 84 yuan 5 cents, and the average price of Tianjin American cotton was 88 yuan 11 cents. The prices of the above three types of cotton are the highest since 1932.

Robbery of Chinese Yarn Factories in the War Zone

The Japanese sought to seize the Chinese yarn factories in the occupied areas, and designated Japanese manufacturers such as Naigaimen, Shanghai, Nichiwa, Tongxing, and Gongda within the Textile Industry Association in Shanghai to take over the Chinese factories, nominally for cooperation, in an attempt to rob them. Because the terms were too harsh, the factories refused to cooperate unanimously. The Japanese plan failed and they simply robbed the machinery and equipment of the factories and moved them elsewhere as their own. For example, most of the Chinese factories in the war zone on the outskirts of Shanghai have been destroyed by artillery fire. Even those that have been spared have had their internal machinery and equipment removed, making it impossible to restore them for the time being. In total, 21 factories, including Hengfeng, Dafeng, Zhentai, Baoxing, and Shanghai, have 760,136 spindles, 91,306 thread spindles, and 24,919 looms, accounting for 67.7% of the original yarn factories.

【Reuters, London, Day】The news of China's payment of the March interest on the 1898 loan was greatly appreciated here. Customs loans have risen by more than half a point. It is generally believed that China will still agree to continue paying customs loans, but this issue is closely linked to further economic assistance.

This year's total army military expenditure is 5.4 billion yen (i.e., 22.5 million pounds). Next year's army budget plan is based on a "two-power standard" to enable Japan to simultaneously cope with China and the Soviet Union, maintain the strength of the Japanese army in China, increase the number of Japanese troops stationed in "Manchukuo," strengthen the air force, and adjust the supply of military supplies. This large army budget plan will inevitably be reduced somewhat by the Ministry of Finance, but not below 5 billion.

Navy Aims to Compete with Britain and the United States

The Ministry of the Navy has not yet released its request, but Navy Minister Yonai recently declared that Japan must implement a plan to control the seas and compete with the naval construction plans of Britain and the United States. It is rumored that the army and navy are in fierce dispute, because the army's request for budget funds is extremely large, which affects the navy's development. In previous years, the budget funds of the Japanese army and navy were increased in a balanced manner, but now the army must request huge funds to cope with the "China Incident," which has affected the navy's funds and must be reduced somewhat.

Special Budget Figures are Astonishing

The Navy's budget for the next fiscal year is 653 million yen (3.8 million British pounds), which is 270 million yen less than this year's naval expenditure, because the expenses incurred by the Navy in China are paid from the special budget. It is reported that the Navy's special budget is about 1.2 billion yen (70 million), so the total Navy budget for the next fiscal year will reach 1.85 billion yen (about 11 million pounds). Based on these figures, it is estimated that the total budget of the Japanese army and navy for the next fiscal year will reach 7.35 billion yen (400 million and 30 million).

Navy Minister Yonai Responds to Questions

【Associated Press, Tokyo, 8th】Navy Minister Yonai declared to the Diet that Japan does not need to establish naval bases on the coast of China again and the government is unwilling to do so. A member asked him whether Japan would sign a military agreement with China after the Sino-Japanese War. The Navy Minister replied that this is what Japan wants most and it will greatly help the establishment of a new order in East Asia. However, it is still impossible to predict how future events will develop.

### Last Year's National Tea Exports Broke Records Totaling Over 25 Million Expected to Increase Again This Year

【Kunming Newsletter】Tea is a special product of our country, and foreign trade accounts for an important sales channel. In the past, Shanghai was the main export station, resold to various countries in Europe and the United States. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, tea-producing areas in eastern China have been ravaged by ×, and exports have been greatly affected. Therefore, the China Tea Company specially came to Yunnan to open another tea factory for large-scale production. According to what is known, the current tea export total has been transferred from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Before the Guangzhou un-ceded guerrilla area, all the tea in central China, such as Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces, was transferred to Hong Kong via the Yuehan Road for export. Since the retreat from Guangzhou, this road is impassable. Currently, most of the national tea is transported from various provinces in the mainland to Yunnan Province, then transported to Hong Kong via Hanoi, or directly to Yangon from this province. According to the survey, the production of national tea has not decreased in the past year. More than 590,000 boxes were transported from Guilin and Yunnan to Hong Kong for transshipment and export, which can be sold for more than 25 million national currency. Moreover, exports of green tea have also increased to 250,000 boxes, while in previous years it was only 200,000 boxes. In addition, 120,000 boxes of Qimen black tea have been shipped out in the past ten months, while in previous years it was only 70,000 to 80,000 boxes. In total, last year's export tea in our country has broken all previous records. It is expected that after Yunnan expands its tea factories this year, sales will definitely increase more than last year.

### Kunming Cultural Trends

— Four Dreams

(IV) Theater Troupe, Punishment Object

Following the development of the War of Resistance, theater troupes in Kunming also sprung up like mushrooms after rain. The first one established was the Jinma Drama Society, which was organized by local youths who loved drama. The society's address was in the Public Education Center, and it has performed no less than a dozen times. The scripts were all highly inflammatory works, such as "Night Light Cup" and "Black Hell", which have won some good reviews. Not long ago, the Shanghai Film Troupe also came from Sichuan. People were shocked by the names of the stars, and the appeal was not small. They performed for more than a month, including "Night Light Cup", "Thunderstorm", and "Sunrise", all of which were progressive works. In addition, the performance was exquisite and realistic, which was really an invigorating agent for the culturally backward Kunming. In addition, many schools organized theater troupes, including the Southwest Associated University Drama Troupe and the Yunnan University Drama Troupe. Two months ago, they had a cold clothing performance to raise money for cold clothing and propaganda, and the results were very good. In the culturally backward Yunnan,

It is already very difficult to have these theater troupes working hard, and they are still growing, so the future achievements are unlimited.

There are many publications in Kunming, including New Trends, Today's Review, South, Wartime Knowledge, New Yunnan, Youth Public Opinion, Cultural Post, Southwest Frontier, etc. Some are dedicated to current affairs, and some are pure literature and art.

"Today's Review" and "New Yunnan" are the most recently published. The editor of "Today's Review" is Professor Qian Duansheng of Southwest Associated University. Most of the articles are written by professors from the Associated University, and the sales are quite good, a bit like the past "Independent Review". The creation issue of "New Yunnan" sold a lot of copies after publication, with articles by Mu Muda, Ma Zihua, etc. This publication has a lot of potential for development in the future.

From all aspects, Kunming's culture is indeed starting to leap forward.

The district office specially sent them to Yong on the 6th to report to the county government. The fathers, brothers, sisters, and brothers of the district set off firecrackers and followed them along the way, and the enthusiastic sentiment was touching. The procession arrived in the afternoon. Wu Shixian, the magistrate of Yong'an County, and all the staff, the director of military service, the captain of the standing team, and the soldiers all came out of the government gate to greet them. Immediately, a welcome meeting was held, and the whole scene was filled with thunderous applause, which showed the firm will of our people to resist the war, and the outburst of national spirit, which has not been seen in thousands of years, and is especially sufficient to guarantee the ultimate victory of the War of Resistance and the ultimate success of nation-building.

【Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 7th】There are many people in the vagrant art training institute in this city, most of whom are young people.

【Central News Agency, Huaiyin, 7th】The counties in the northwest corner of Jiangsu Province have been isolated from news. The provincial government sent personnel to inspect them, and they recently returned to report that the power of the counties has been laid a foundation after the hard struggle of the county magistrates, and the broad masses of people have been mobilized to establish anti-Japanese forces. Now the traces of the × pseudo have disappeared in Xiao-Pei counties, and Fengxian city has been captured and abandoned several times. The × are trapped in the city and dare not leave the city. The suburbs of Xuzhou city are ten miles away from the activity area of ​​our guerrillas. Currently, the anti-Japanese forces in the counties are scattered in various villages, organizing farmers, and attacking the × from time to time. Puppet organizations automatically disband, traitors have turned against them, the rich donate food to help the army, and the poor are eager to serve. The atmosphere is full of anti-Japanese spirit, which is a significant improvement compared to a few months ago.

[Kunming Aviation News] The first phase of the Yunnan Province Volunteer Conscript Police Training is coming to an end, and the first phase is being continued. It is also heard that the Pacification Headquarters and the Provincial Government, in order to transfer funds and quickly form the self-defense army of the people in various counties, will send a telegram to all cities and counties in the province, so that those who have not sent to training in the first phase will be exempt, and the second phase will be postponed.

### Glorious Attack on Hu Town

— By Bai Wei

— Travel Notes from Returning to Hui, Part Seven —

Arriving at Hu Town, the reporter couldn't help but think of the glorious attack on Hu Town. So, I immediately visited the old hero Hu Zhunan, who assisted in the battle. Fortunately, I met him at a shop in Jili. Old hero Hu is already over seventy years old, but his piercing eyes and grizzled iron beard still retain the spirit of a young man. After paying my respects, I sat beside the roaring fire and listened to old hero Hu recount the glorious battle.

"It was in early December, when the × people started to withdraw, with vehicles passing by continuously," old hero Hu began briskly.

"At the time, Battalion Commander Lian Shuying of the 157th Division, who was stationed near Hu Town and responsible for guerrilla warfare, decided to launch a surprise attack and discussed the plan with me. We decided that his battalion would be divided into three groups, ambushing in the mountain ravine two or three miles below Xiangang Bridge, while I would cover the rear."

"Sure enough, we hadn't been ambushed for long when the × people's vehicles came in formation. We waited until more than ten vehicles at the front of the × convoy had passed, and then the central group immediately launched a sweeping attack, overturning four vehicles on the spot. The left and right groups also sprang into action. When the × people saw the ambush, they immediately stopped all the vehicles and lined them up within the firing range of our central group, totaling over a hundred vehicles. Under our intensive fire, another eight vehicles were overturned. The × soldiers inside the vehicles scattered like birds and beasts. Later investigations revealed that about a hundred were killed. The troops on our left and right wings, seeing the central group firing so enthusiastically, actually abandoned their guard duties and ran to the central group to fire as well. The × people then dispatched about a thousand soldiers from the front and rear vehicles, dividing them into two groups to encircle us. Our entire army unknowingly fell into the × people's encirclement."

In this situation, the reporter couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat for our brave troops. But old hero Hu continued calmly:

"Fortunately, I led eighty or ninety local men to scout on the mountain behind. Seeing the × soldiers spreading across the mountains in separate groups, I rushed to the rescue from a small path behind the mountain, leading the troops that were in operation to break out of the × people's encirclement via a small path."

"Then our troops didn't suffer much loss, right?" Although the reporter's heart was much relieved, I couldn't help but worry.

"Loss? The loss was very small. Two brothers were injured, and a squad leader named Chen died in battle!"

Mentioning squad leader Chen, the old hero's tone became somewhat choked. He said, "Squad leader Chen was truly a great warrior of the Chinese nation. Initially, he was in the central group, holding a light machine gun and taking the lead, strafing the × vehicles. Later, he felt that strafing was less effective than direct fire, so he crawled forward and faced the embankment of the road, aiming the machine gun at the front of the vehicles, so that the bullets entered straight through the front, pierced through the interior, and entered the neighboring vehicle. In the cacophony of gunfire, I don't know how many × soldiers' lives were taken. After shooting for about ten minutes, the × people discovered his position. In the concentrated counterattack of several × machine guns, he suffered several serious injuries to his legs. But this still doesn't show the greatness of squad leader Chen; there was an even greater deed later!"

"At that time, Battalion Commander Lian heard that his machine gun was silent and knew he must be injured, so he called several brothers to risk their lives to rescue him and carry him to the rear. But he said to those who rescued him, 'Brothers, I'm finished now. Carrying me back is useless. You can take this machine gun back, uncover the lids of two hand grenades and give them to me, so that I can exchange my dying life for a few more × people!' Those brothers asked him several times to go back to the rear, but he refused. So, they gave him two hand grenades and left with tears in their eyes. The next day, after the × people retreated, we went to find his remains. Although his remains were bloody and unrecognizable after being blown apart by shrapnel, there were two large patches of blood on the grass near his body. Sir, isn't this great deed 'startling to heaven and earth, and moving to ghosts and gods'? So, we chose a site on the mountain beside Xianggong Bridge that day and buried him publicly."

"The green hills are fortunate to bury loyal bones." I think squad leader Chen's heroism not only makes the green hills magnificent but also makes the mountains and rivers magnificent.

### British Prime Minister's Declaration Unanimously Approved by Parliament Adequate Response to US Stance Definite Warning to Germany and Italy

[Reuters, London, 7th] The British House of Commons adjourned early yesterday, and it was impossible to fully express opinions on Chamberlain's declaration of British-French solidarity in the National Assembly of Political Affairs. Today, the opinions of the members of the National Assembly have become clear. Judging from the speeches made by representatives of various parties, Chamberlain's declaration has been widely approved. Opinions from all parties are generally as follows: In view of the fact that some countries still have doubts about Britain's attitude towards France in the current situation, Chamberlain had no choice but to issue this declaration on Monday. Some people even believe that this declaration should have been issued months ago. The attitude of the United States has become increasingly clear recently. Members of parliament believe that Chamberlain's move is adequate to respond to it. The opposition Labor Party even asked the government to take further steps to promote cooperation between all democratic countries, especially the United States. All parties expressed satisfaction with the UK's current guarantee. Strengthening relations with France is considered an inevitable result. Members of parliament opposed to the government had previously severely criticized government policies, but they unanimously approved this declaration. Furthermore, the most sufficient proof that the declaration has achieved good results in Congress is that the opposition has decided to temporarily cease opposition. They have also been working hard to promote the government's recent declarations.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons, stating that Britain would assist France in the event of war in the future. U.S. diplomatic circles expressed deep satisfaction upon hearing this, and said that the British government authorities have never made such definite statements regarding the British-French alliance. Therefore, if France were to be attacked in the future, Britain's attitude is now clear. These people also believe that this is the most definite warning to German Head of State Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and it is sufficient to strengthen the similar warning issued by President Roosevelt last week. Generally speaking, the London side has already received reports that Germany is preparing to threaten Western Europe before advancing eastward. Chamberlain issued a firm statement in order to strike first, which, in short, greatly satisfies the alliance between Britain and France. It is believed that this move not only strengthens the power of the British and French governments, but also serves as the most important factor in maintaining peace in Europe.

### Bonnet's Speech France's International Relations

[Reuters, Paris, 7th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet delivered a speech in the House of Representatives today on France's international relations, saying that in recent weeks, France has maintained close contact with the U.S. government, and the U.S. government understands France very well. He said, "The three major democratic countries are extremely clear about their material and spiritual strength. They know their position on Earth and in history and their economic power, and they also know that no country can force them into a certain political system. However, the friendship between these democratic countries does not harm anyone, nor does it want to harm anyone. What they demand is peace and development for these three major countries." "No country, large or small, needs to think that these three major countries will be their enemies." Referring to Hitler's speech on January 30, in which he said that Germany does not want to export National Socialism, Bonnet said, "We can also make the same guarantee. Democratic countries do not want to engage in external propaganda, let alone external aggression." Bonnet also said that he has worked hard to eliminate misunderstandings between France and Italy and believes that the goodwill between the peoples of the two countries is sufficient to arouse friendship between the two countries. "I cannot imagine that Italy will invade France. I really cannot imagine that France and Italy are connected by blood, language, and culture." He also solemnly stated that the French government will not allow any other government to endanger the integrity of Spain. Italy has assured Britain that it has no territorial ambitions in Spain. What France hopes for is the fulfillment of this promise. He then mentioned that in the past few weeks, rumors spread that the solidarity between Britain and France was not very strong, saying, "I have already had this question answered by Mr. Chamberlain, the most loyal and great friend of our country." Bonnet then quoted Chamberlain's declaration in the House of Commons amid enthusiastic applause from the audience and said, "Gentlemen, you must understand the full meaning of this declaration." After Bonnet finished his speech, members of parliament from all parties, except the Socialist Party, applauded unanimously.

[Associated Press, London, 8th] "The News Chronicle" wrote today, "Chamberlain's words are extremely important and clear, and it is unlikely that they will be misunderstood by any foreign country. The solidarity among democratic countries is gradually increasing, and President Roosevelt has provided good leadership."

### US Anti-War President Reber's Speech Opposes Fortifying Guam

[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] Dr. Reber, president of the National Anti-War Association, recently delivered a speech to the Faison Committee, criticizing the plan to expand the military on Guam as an unnecessary act of hostility towards Japan, which could have serious consequences. He said, There are twenty-nine places where members can serve as military bases. Why choose Guam alone? The conclusion stated, "If Japan establishes a base off the coast of Mexico for five million or only one million yuan, or Germany establishes a base on the Caribbean coast for 500,000 yuan, both will be the greatest threat to the national security of the United States."

### Italy's Neutral Military Law Revision Completed Mussolini's Report

[Central News Agency, Rome, 7th] It is reported that Mussolini submitted a report to the Supreme National Defense Committee that Italy's neutral military law has been completely revised.

### British House of Commons Questions Loans to China

[Reuters, London, 8th] Yesterday, a member of the British House of Commons questioned Overseas Trade Minister Hudson, "Regarding granting China credit loans to promote trade with China, can your minister report on this?

British cotton textile exports to China and Hong Kong have increased by 18 percent.

### Zhang Pengchun's Lecture Our New War Strategy Future Indicates Japan's Strength is Declining Enthusiastic Applause in the British House of Commons

[Reuters, London, 8th] Dr. Zhang Pengchun of China gave a speech yesterday at the House of Commons to the China Committee of the Conservative Party's Foreign Affairs Committee. A large number of people attended the meeting. Dr. Zhang discussed the future of China's new strategy in great detail. He said that this new strategy is about to begin. China's past strategy was defensive. The Japanese army repeatedly tried to encircle and annihilate the Chinese army, but all attempts failed. There are now far more Chinese troops than at the beginning of the war. They have been fully trained during the war, so their combat effectiveness is stronger. After describing the nature of the upcoming anti-Japanese war plan in the coming months, he proceeded to discuss the international situation and pointed out that after Japan's war against China, its strength not only did not increase, but greatly weakened. His speech impressed the audience deeply and received enthusiastic applause after the speech.

### Britain and France Maintain Spanish Integrity Seek Peaceful Withdrawal of Italian Troops Geta Expresses Four Demands

[Associated Press, London, 8th] The British and French governments are trying hard to prevent the overthrow of the Spanish government, because if the rebels win, Spain will become a base threatening British and French territories. Spanish government troops are retreating into French territory in a continuous stream. It is generally believed that the time to make demands on Italy is approaching. Germany will also assist Italy's demands in order to simultaneously raise its demands for colonies. Since the beginning of the Spanish War, Britain and France have long sought to prevent Italy from gaining a foothold in Spanish territory in order to avoid affecting its communication with its colonies. Therefore, Britain and France decided: 1. Britain and France will not recognize the rebel government or provide it with economic assistance until Franco has completely expelled German and Italian troops from Spanish territory. 2. Prevent Italian troops from occupying Menorca. 3. Jointly demand that the rebels not approach the French border. Britain and France are determined to seek peace and withdraw Italian troops from Spanish territory, but Franco's firm demand for unconditional surrender by the government army has dealt a major blow to this effort by Britain and France.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 7th] An Italian evening newspaper published an article written by Geta yesterday, in which he listed four points that he believed must be implemented before Italian volunteers withdraw: (1) All Spanish Republican troops who retreat into French territory must be demobilized to avoid threatening the stability of the National Army. (2) Restrict the activities of Republican government leaders who fled to France. (3) All government troops inside and outside Spain must surrender unconditionally. (4) The Republican government must return all treasures and cash from the Spanish bank that it stole and transported to France. Secondly, regarding British Prime Minister Chamberlain's official statement in the House of Lords yesterday that Britain and France have an alliance, it is requested that even if a war occurs, no one in Italy is unaware that Britain will assist France. However, what the Italians suspect is whether Britain will pay for France's tough policy under any circumstances, because this policy is the opposite of Chamberlain's policy and is likely to cause international disputes.

### Spanish Government Statement Continue the War of Resistance

[Reuters, London, 8th] According to an official from the Spanish Embassy in Britain, "Spanish Prime Minister Negrin, accompanied by many cabinet members, has arrived in France and will return home soon to continue the war of resistance. He and his cabinet members will establish a government in Valencia to continue the war of resistance to the end. There are about 300,000 refugees who have arrived in France."

[Associated Press, London, 7th] The Spanish government has now rejected the mediation of Britain and France and announced that it will return to Valencia soon to continue the war of resistance in southern Spain. The Spanish Embassy in London announced that Mr. Negrin has decided to fight to the end in the Madrid and Valencia regions with General Ugi's Central Army. The area includes nine provinces and about 47,000 square miles. The land is extremely fertile. It is understood that Mr. Negrin is currently planning to leave one or two cabinet members in Paris to manage refugee issues. General Magy has a well-trained army of about 400,000 men, currently stationed in Madrid, Valencia, Cartagena, and Alicante. At the same time, rebel personnel regard this statement as nonsense. They believe that Franco's army can resolve the Spanish government army in six or eight weeks.

### Rebel Army Officially Claims Determined to Advance South Again

[Associated Press, London, 7th] The Spanish rebel army officially announced that General Franco will send a large army of Spanish Moroccan troops and Italian troops, about 300,000 men, to advance south from Catalonia to attack Madrid and Valencia together with the Central Army. The official pointed out that Franco will adopt a flanking attack between Madrid and Valencia to cut off traffic between Madrid and the Mediterranean Sea. Now both Britain and France are willing to force Spain to compromise with each other, so there is a risk of being involved in international disputes. Therefore, while striving for peace, they are still trying to maintain their own security.

[Associated Press, Perpignan, 8th] Spanish rebels have captured the towns of Figueras and Rosas. The government fleet was forced to retreat, either sailing to French ports or along the coast of Valencia. Also, the morale of the government troops in central Spain is very low, and there is a fear of imminent collapse. British and French diplomats are prepared to mediate peace talks.

### Dutch National Policy Foreign Minister Announces in the Senate Maintaining Friendly Relations with Germany

[Central News Agency, The Hague, 6th] Foreign Minister Badtinh presented a memorandum to the Senate, emphasizing the need for the Netherlands to maintain good relations with Germany. Since the major powers have no determination to maintain international order in accordance with the law, the Dutch foreign policy is based on the League of Nations. As far as German-Dutch relations are concerned, German Head of State Hitler stated in his speech on the 30th of last month that his country is willing to maintain good relations with the Netherlands. The Dutch government should also avoid any actions that may hinder these good relations. At this time, ideological trends and political trends are intertwined and interacting with each other. If we want to restore normal relations among the various ethnic groups, we must adopt a moderate attitude. Since the European War, Germany has striven to improve and its national power has been greatly enhanced, which the Dutch nation admires very much.

### Palestine Conference: Negotiations Encounter Difficulties; Arab Delegations Refuse to Cooperate; British Government Hopes to Avoid Disputes

[Associated Press, London, 7th] The Palestine Conference, convened by the British government and the Mufti party, showed signs of breakdown today. In protest against the National Defense Party's negotiations in London, a general strike occurred in Palestine, accompanied by acts of terror. The Arab delegation refused to cooperate with the National Defense Party to form a united front for discussions with the British government. It is reported that the Mufti party cannot represent Palestine; therefore, despite the British government's invitation, there is no need to come to London. The Mufti party also claimed to be the true representatives of the Palestinian Arabs. The National Defense Party stated that they only wished to have the right to express their views; therefore, in the event of a stalemate, they insisted that the formation of a separate delegation for them should not be opposed. The British government hopes, if possible, to avoid making the discussion situation complicated and fraught with disputes, and is even willing to transform the discussions into trilateral consultations. The main policies of the Mufti party and the National Defense Party differ only on the terrorist policies implemented by the National Defense Party against the Mufti party. On other points, both sides agree: 1. Stop Jewish immigration and prohibit the sale of Arab land to Jews; 2. The British must abandon the plan to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine; 3. The British must abandon the Balfour Declaration and the British Mandate plan; 4. Establish an independent, self-reliant Arab government, with Italy and France guaranteeing the current Jewish minority.

[Reuters, London, 7th] Today, Prime Minister Chamberlain addressed the Jewish delegation attending the Palestine Conference, saying that during the extremely difficult situation in Palestine, the Jewish residents' spirit of self-restraint and strict adherence to order was admirable. The Jewish talks are expected to begin tomorrow.

[Reuters, London, 7th] At the opening of the Palestine Conference today, after Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a welcome speech, Prince Saif of the Hashemite family responded, expressing gratitude to the British government for its efforts for truth and peace. He said that Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent efforts to resolve international disputes are evident in his welcoming speech, which will be the greatest basis for resolving the Palestine issue, which has long been of concern to all Arabs and Muslims. We admire Chamberlain's spirit of resolving all disputes with humanitarian sincerity and truth, and hope that this enlightened policy will always be successful.

[Reuters, London, 7th] Talks on adjusting the opinions of the Arab Mufti Party and the National Defense Party continued today. Colonial Secretary MacDonald met with the National Defense Party for a very long time, with only one break from evening to night. It is believed that MacDonald visited the Prime Minister at that time.

### Brief Commentary: Traitors and "Japanese Traitors"

The China Central News Agency (Chongqing, 6th) reports: "Many Japanese serving as guidance officials and advisors in puppet organizations have recently been found to sympathize with China's resistance against Japan. These Japanese are called 'Japanese traitors.' The Japanese military intelligence department has now begun a general investigation of all Japanese employees in the puppet organizations, and anyone suspected will be dismissed immediately." Furthermore, a Tokyo dispatch on the 7th stated: "According to foreign news, a 'new spy' panic is occurring in Japan, and these 'spies' are mostly serving China." The emergence of "Japanese traitors" and the resulting panic among the Japanese government are sufficient evidence of the crisis in Japan's invasion of China, which is intensifying. Conversely, it also shows that China's united resistance against Japan is becoming increasingly bright.

However, these so-called "Japanese traitors" cannot be viewed "equally" with China's traitors. Why? First, let's talk about Chinese traitors, which now generally refers to all Chinese who betray the interests of the Chinese nation, willingly serve as tools for the × people, and undermine the united resistance against Japan. They use the smokescreen of "anti-communism" and "peace" to carry out their conspiracies of sowing discord and undermining the united resistance; or they use defeatist and surrender theories to numb and erode our national self-esteem and confidence; or they act as spies for the × people to deplete and destroy all our nation's living and inanimate forces. Such people are traitors and spies to the Chinese nation; at the same time, because China's resistance against Japan is a war to defend human civilization and maintain world peace in the international sense, these Chinese traitors and spies are also public enemies of the world.

Conversely, the "Japanese traitors" discovered by Japan are implementing defeatist strategies within the Japanese invasion camp, carrying out sabotage of the war effort, and using various means, under very difficult circumstances, to instigate incidents from within Japan and the invading army, increasing the difficulties for the Japanese invading authorities and assisting the progress of China's anti-Japanese war. Such people are, of course, regarded as spies and traitors by the Japanese invading authorities; in the Chinese and international sense, they are heroes alongside Chinese soldiers in defending human civilization and maintaining world peace. Even from the perspective of Japan itself, because Japan's war of aggression against foreign countries is only for a small number of militarists and plutocrats to gain profit, not only is it of no benefit to the vast majority of the Japanese people, but it will also cause the Japanese people to lose their minimum living conditions in a long and continuous war. Therefore, the work of these "Japanese traitors" completely meets the urgent need of the Japanese people to seek liberation, and they should not only not be regarded as Japanese traitors, but are actually heroes fighting for the liberation of the Japanese nation!

China's defeatists and anti-war activists are enemies of the Chinese national revolutionary front and also enemies of the Japanese people. At the same time, Japan's defeatists and anti-war activists are friendly forces of the Chinese national revolution and also loyal and brave soldiers of the Japanese nation. We must expand propaganda to show that Japan's war of aggression against China is also a war that harms the Japanese nation, and that China's war of resistance against Japan is not only seeking its own national liberation but also helping the Japanese nation to liberate itself. We must welcome and support the anti-war movement under the difficult leadership of the Japanese Communist Party and all righteous and progressive people, and we must further eliminate the anti-communist and anti-war movement of defeatists lurking in China, for the liberation of the Chinese and Japanese nations, and for the sake of defending world peace and human civilization.

### The German-Japanese Espionage Alliance

Every day at noon, a Japanese dignitary would drive to the German military headquarters on Betle Road, pass through the saluting guards, and enter a solemn office. Inside, a German officer would be waiting, and after bowing to him, would hand him a very heavy box.

The Japanese dignitary would say "Farewell," and the German officer would respond with "Farewell." The Japanese dignitary, carrying the box as if a mother holding a baby, would then walk out of the gate, get into his car, and return to a solemn and magnificent Western-style house on Zoo Road. The Japanese dignitary was none other than Colonel Oshima, the military attaché at the Japanese Embassy in Germany. From January 26, 1936, he personally collected this box from the German Army Headquarters every day.

The box contained copies of reports obtained by German intelligence agents sent to foreign countries. According to the agreement, the funds used by the German spies to collect secret intelligence were borne by Japan. The collected intelligence was then handed over to the special agency stationed in Berlin. This peculiar agreement was signed at the same time as the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact.

Colonel Oshima signed this agreement on the instructions of Araki of the Japanese military and the notorious Japanese spy Doihara, in order to reduce the obstacles faced by Japanese spies in their activities abroad.

Although the Japanese government spent five million yen annually on intelligence work, the authorities believed that the materials obtained were not only insufficient but also not necessarily entirely reliable. The appearance of Japanese spies often caused them great difficulties in their work. The world saw these yellow-faced youngsters traveling abroad as spies, which often made it difficult for those who were actually engaged in gathering intelligence to be seen.

Doihara, seeing through this shortcoming, had no choice but to turn his attention to those whose faces were not so easily distinguishable as spies. He sent people to recruit many impoverished White Russian officers in nightclubs in Shanghai and Singapore, forming espionage teams. He sent some of them to sneak into Russia to do transmission work, sending reports back to Changchun. He set up this organization with an expenditure of one million yen. The staff members were all Soviet Russian employees working on the Chinese Eastern Railway. The main person in charge was Arlbar, who went to Weichun every week to report on the work of the White Russian spies. Doihara also had a group of Western spies who, under the guise of tourism, traveled to the Americas, trying to get close to officers in the army, navy, and air force.

Many times, they cooperated with American officers.

In 1935, the Soviet Union's secret police uncovered Arlbar's conspiracy and arrested him on his way to Changchun. He provided a list of Japanese spies operating in the Soviet Union, and as a result, none escaped, and they were all executed in 1936. The American officers who cooperated with them were also arrested in the United States, and the US Army's counterintelligence department used this opportunity to completely wipe out the entire Japanese espionage network in the United States.

The collapse of this espionage organization was to be expected, and the Japanese government was not surprised by it. Politicians close to Araki and Terauchi believed that hiring untrustworthy White Russians as spies was a dangerous policy. They advocated the establishment of a reliable espionage organization, and the head of this group was Nakano Seigo, the leader of the fascist organization Toa Renmei.

Nakano believed that Japan and Germany should form an alliance, with the naval and military departments of both countries jointly funding intelligence work. He sent a young man, Futaki Kita, to Berlin to explore the possibility of cooperation. In 1932, he personally traveled to Berlin to directly negotiate this matter.

Upon arriving in Berlin, he presented his plan to key figures in the German military, but the late General Schleicher and Colonel Plietzsch, the head of the intelligence department, expressed no interest in cooperation. Schleicher's secretary, Walter, was very enthusiastic and introduced Nakano to Goebbels and Colonel Nikolaus of the Nazi Party's intelligence department. A Japanese intelligence office was established within the Nazi Party, and the exchange of intelligence began.

In 1933, Hitler came to power, Schleicher was dismissed, and Nakano's proposal was reconsidered by the German military. It received the support of Lieutenant Colonel Lichner, a protégé of Schleicher. Walter, who was then a major, submitted a report to the authorities, which was adopted by the government. In 1934, he was sent to Japan as a military attaché at the embassy, ​​responsible for German-Japanese espionage work. On June 30, 1934, Schleicher and Plietzsch were killed during the Nazi Party's purge.

Nakano returned to Japan and invited Doihara, Araki, and Army Minister Terauchi to a meeting at his home. Walter also attended and spoke extensively, declaring that Germany was very willing to implement Nakano's plan and also establish a joint anti-Soviet treaty. They sat on the carpet, drinking green tea, and forged this German-Japanese espionage alliance, publicly recommending General Araki to be responsible for gaining the support of conservatives in the army and navy for this plan. In 1935, the authorities of both the army and navy agreed to Nakano's plan.

Soon after, Oshima, a henchman of Doihara, was sent to Germany to take charge of affairs. In 1936, he telegraphed Nakano, saying that this agreement had already been effective. (Zhu Wan)

The required military expenditure has also increased accordingly. According to investigations, in the ten years since 1929, Hong Kong's defense military expenditure has reached a total of 52,160,094 dollars. On average, each resident of Hong Kong, regardless of Chinese or Westerner, must bear more than 50 dollars. Among them, payments to the United Kingdom for imperial defense military expenditure account for 50,719,240 dollars.

During this period, the maintenance costs of the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps also reached 1,255,550 dollars. The Hong Kong Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve was established later than the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps, only four years ago, so the maintenance cost was only 143,304 dollars. The expenditure of the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps and the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve is increasing year by year. Last year, the expenditure of the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps was twice as high as in 1929, and the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve also increased by 70 percent compared to its establishment four years ago. At the same time, the burden of imperial defense expenditure has also doubled compared to ten years ago. The Hong Kong authorities have now obtained the government's agreement to stipulate that the said burden will be fixed at 6 million dollars per year in the future. In the past, Hong Kong's burden exceeding 6 million dollars only occurred last year and in 1932. The following is a list of Hong Kong's annual military expenditure burden in the last ten years:

### Overcrowding in Various Parts of Vietnam: Unemployed Overseas Chinese Wander and Suffer; Local Government Arrests and Repatriates Them in Large Numbers; A Message to Overseas Chinese: Do Not Rashly Emigrate to the South

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, compatriots in the country have been affected by the calamities of war and have flocked to overseas countries to make a living. In the past year, the number of people leaving the country through Hong Kong cannot be counted. However, the economies of various parts of Southeast Asia have not recovered, and commerce is still sluggish. As a result, there is a feeling of overcrowding. Recently, a large number of overseas Chinese in Singapore, Penang, and other places have been unemployed and forced to return to the country. According to investigations by reporters, more than a hundred overseas Chinese were also forced to return to the country from Vietnam yesterday due to unemployment. They spoke to reporters about the severe situation of unemployment among overseas Chinese in Vietnam. The following is a record:

Wandering and Suffering; The Situation is Extremely Miserable

It is reported that since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, a large number of compatriots from Fujian and Guangdong have gone abroad to seek a living in Saigon. Among them, people from Chaozhou, Quanzhou, Xiamen, and other places are the most numerous. Overseas Chinese stores in the local area are all overcrowded. Those who can obtain a livelihood are few and far between. The unemployed are everywhere. Because they have no relatives, a large number of them are wandering the streets, and some have even become beggars, begging everywhere. The situation is extremely difficult and pitiful. This kind of situation is rare in Saigon.

Authorities Issue Orders; Arresting Poor Overseas Chinese in Large Numbers

Last year, the Western Saigon authorities, in view of the wandering of our overseas Chinese, ordered them to return to their country freely and promised to exempt those who returned to the country in early January from paying this year's tax papers. At that time, a large number of people returned to the country. However, because of the lack of travel expenses and the wandering on the streets, there were still many beggars. Most recently, the French authorities, seeing that our overseas Chinese beggars were found everywhere, which was detrimental to the view, specially ordered the arrest and repatriation of more than a hundred people on the sixteenth of last month. Arrests are still continuing one after another.

Local Overseas Chinese; Find Ways to Provide Relief

After our arrests, the shipping costs and living expenses are borne by the various clan associations. It costs 8.8 dollars per person to return to the country from Western Saigon, including food, which is three times more than before the War of Resistance. Now that the number of refugees returning to the country is increasing daily and the prices of boats have also increased, the various clan associations are struggling to cope with the payment of travel expenses. Currently, they are trying their best to solve this problem. It is heard that they will set up a job introduction center to introduce jobs to poor overseas Chinese.

### Robbery Occurs on Jordan Road, Yau Ma Tei Yesterday; Three Thieves Enter a House Armed in Broad Daylight; The Sun Residence Loses Over 300 Dollars

The residence of Sun Shechuan on the second floor of No. 5 Jordan Road, Kowloon, was robbed by three thieves yesterday afternoon, resulting in a loss of 360 dollars. The thieves disappeared without a trace after succeeding. The authorities have ordered police stations in various districts to pay close attention. The details of the case are recorded below:

The residence that was robbed was the residence of Sun Shechuan on the first floor of No. 5 Jordan Road, Yau Ma Tei. The owner is Sun Zisheng, the housewife is Sun Zhangshi, and Sun has a son, Sun Yixing. In addition to these three, there are also three maids and two children in the house. Yixing is nine years old and is currently studying at the Yizhi Girls' Middle School branch, which is located in the Dongchang Bank in Kwan Chung. Yixing goes to school every morning at around 8:00 am and is dismissed at 12:00 pm for lunch, always accompanied by another maid, He Miaoyu, except on Sundays and public holidays. Sun Zisheng works in a large commercial firm and also leaves early and returns late every day, so the only people guarding the door at home are his housewife, Sun Zhangshi, and two maids. Yesterday at 12:00 pm, the maid He Miaoyu accompanied her young master Yixing home. When they reached the door, it was 12:15 pm. When ascending the stairs, Miaoyu went first, and Yixing followed behind. Unexpectedly, someone was following behind Yixing. That person pointed a small knife at Yixing's back and whispered, "Do not make a sound. If you dare to do anything, I will stab you in the back." Yixing, seeing the situation, was speechless and almost unable to take a step. When Miaoyu knocked on the door, she did not suspect that the person following Yixing had ulterior motives. When the door opened, Miaoyu entered, followed by Yixing, and then by the man. After the man, two more people rushed up. The door was already open, and there was no way to close it. The three men then rushed in together. After the three thieves entered the house, in addition to the first thief, who had a small knife, the other two thieves, one held a small sword and the other held a pistol. In addition to Yixing, who was a boy, everyone else in the house was a woman. Suddenly encountering this, they were all dumbfounded and unable to say a word. The one holding the pistol immediately drove everyone into a corner, and the one holding the knife cut the telephone line on the table. The one holding the sword then closed the door and stood in front of it as a lookout. After the one holding the knife cut the telephone line, he took out a bundle of thick rope and tied the women's hands behind their backs, and then stuffed their mouths with several gags to prevent them from calling the police. After everything was done, they then proceeded to search for valuables. As a result of the search, the thieves obtained a gold necklace, one foot and four inches long, worth 200 dollars; a pendant weighing seven mace, worth 70 dollars; a gold ring inlaid with a ruby, worth 30 dollars; a pair of almond-shaped gold earrings, worth 10 dollars; and two overcoats, worth 50 dollars, for a total value of 360 dollars. After the thieves succeeded, they still wanted to continue searching, but they heard footsteps on the stairs, fearing that the owner of the house had returned from outside, which would be bad, so they hurriedly collected the above-mentioned jewelry and left. After the thieves left, the women in the house, after struggling for some time, finally untied the ropes. Because the telephone line had been cut, there was no way to use the telephone to report the crime. They then ordered someone to report to Sun Zisheng and ordered the maid He Miaoyu to report the crime to the Yau Ma Tei Police Station. It was already 1:25 pm. The duty officer at the police station, after receiving the report, immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to the house to investigate the robbery and notified the various medical stations to send police officers to patrol in various places, hoping to arrest the bandits and bring them to justice.

Yesterday morning, he was charged in the Kowloon Magistracy with committing the crime on the 6th of this month, colluding with two men who are still at large, and using sharp weapons such as axes and awls to beat Qu Ji, intending to injure another person's body. The prosecuting officer requested that the case be adjourned for three days to allow sufficient time to gather evidence. The magistrate approved the request. It was also mistakenly believed that the incident occurred when Chinese soldiers in the refugee camp had once again attempted to escape, and that the guards had fired to stop them.

### Hong Kong News in Brief

Relief for Displaced Farmers

Mr. Chen Pishi led the commissioners of the Shenzhen Rural Work Executive Committee to convene a joint meeting with the magistrates of Dongguan and Baoan Counties in Shenzhen on Saturday, the 4th of this month, to discuss the relief of displaced farmers in the area. According to Magistrate Wang of Dongguan, an area of approximately twenty miles in length and width in Dongguan City and Humen Village was destroyed by aircraft bombing, preventing the farmers in the area from returning to their hometowns to cultivate the land. It was then decided to accommodate these displaced farmers on wasteland for cultivation to prevent vagrancy. The matter has been reported to Chairman Li Hanhun of the Guangdong Provincial Government for approval before implementation.

Crackdown on Drug Den

At 2:30 PM on the 20th of last month, Customs Officer Stephen and Customs Deputy Supervisor and Chemist Tai, acting on intelligence, led a group of detectives to search the third floor of 67 Dadao West. A large quantity of red pills, numbering 63,500, was found in the rear room of the floor. A suspected woman, Chen Benqi, was arrested on the spot. Yesterday afternoon, she was charged at the Central Magistracy, presided over by Justice of the Peace, with the offense of possessing red pills. The case was prosecuted by Government Counsel, Wei, and the defendant was represented by Lawyer Rollesby. As a result, the court ruled that the case be adjudicated.

### × Warships converge on Weizhou Island, Imperial Airways planes reroute to avoid the fate of the Delia

Recently, × warships have converged on Weizhou Island near Beihai, making threatening movements. Yesterday morning, Imperial Airways planes from Binjiang to Hong Kong, including the Dorada, the Danner Dallas, and the Delia, all rerouted to avoid that area, because the Delia was recently bombarded by × warships in the waters near that area. The first to arrive in Hong Kong was the Dorada, which arrived at 11:30 AM yesterday after circling south of the island. The other two planes, which were originally scheduled to arrive at 4:05 PM yesterday, also flew the same diverted route. The Dorada had not flown since its accident in Binjiang in November of last year. It was carrying 480 pounds of airmail from the UK to Hong Kong. This mail has been delayed for five days. The other two planes were also carrying a large amount of mail from the UK and Australia to Hong Kong. Also on the Dorada yesterday were Mr. and Mrs. Blandy of Jardine Matheson, who were returning from a trip to Calcutta, India. In addition, Mrs. Kerby came to Hong Kong to see her son, who is currently serving in the Navy. Mrs. Kerby will be staying in Hong Kong for several days.

### Great Sympathy: American doctor comes to China to serve, Frederick Hume arrives in Hong Kong, will go to the front lines for relief work

[Special report from this newspaper] Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese people have suffered misfortune. Those who have died under the aircraft and artillery of the × people number in the millions. People of the world feel anger and indignation about this, and there are many who uphold justice and aid China. Dr. Frederick Hume, a famous American doctor, has also expressed sympathy for our war of resistance, so he has come to China from America to join the International Red Cross and go to the front lines to participate in the relief work for our wounded soldiers and refugees. Dr. Cao departed from America last month on the French postal ship "Asia No. 10" and arrived in Hong Kong on the 7th. The location where Dr. Cao will serve will be determined after discussions with the International Red Cross. (Jun)

### Serving on the South Xun Frontline

— Qizhuo

Report by Wu Wenwei, Leader of the South Xun Rescue Team of the Red Cross Society

Salute — to the friends who go to the front to serve the soldiers fighting the war — your sweat and the soldiers' blood merge into an enthusiastic and powerful tide of national liberation, writing a brilliant and great history of national liberation. You, like the soldiers fighting the war, are the excellent children of the Chinese nation!

The Guangzhou Red Cross Society hosted reporters at the Swiss Hotel at 3 PM yesterday. Wu Wenwei, the leader of the South Xun Frontline Rescue Team of the Society, reported on the frontline rescue situation and war experiences. Upon hearing the news, the reporter took two steps forward as three steps and went to the meeting on time. In the meeting place, a man in a yellow military uniform with a Red Cross badge, full of vigor, was emitting light. It must be Captain Wu who has returned from the front line, the reporter hurriedly stepped forward to ask, and then asked several questions that the reporter wanted to know. Captain Wu also enthusiastically talked about it. Just as they were talking vividly, the guests were already full, and Captain Wu brought the conversation to a conclusion and formally opened the meeting.

Everyone sat around the rectangular table. Chairman Zhu Guangtao first reported on the general situation of the Guangzhou Red Cross Society's work in the inland areas. He learned that their spirit of service became more vigorous under the guns of artillery. In addition, several others gave speeches. The following paragraph is a quick summary of Captain Wu Wenwei's separate conversation with the reporter and the public report at the meeting:

Work Dynamics

The Guangzhou Red Cross Society's Frontline Rescue Team, consisting of more than 40 people, brought three ambulances and a large number of materials and equipment. They departed from Guangzhou on October 17 last year to serve on the South Xun route. The monthly cost is approximately 2,000 national currency, which is provided by the Guangzhou Red Cross Society. Under the crazy bombing of the × planes, the front line spread such a sentence: "The daytime is the × people's. The night is ours". Let the air raids be air raids, let us see how many bombs the × people have. However, from dusk to dawn the next day, it is time for our serious work.

The front needs soldiers, the rear needs the people, what about the middle? The middle needs liaisons to coordinate the front and rear. The team is responsible for such a great task. It is like rescuing wounded soldiers from front hospitals to the rear, and escorting soldiers who have been treated in rear hospitals to the front. On the South Xun route, with Nanchang as the center, there are many rescue stations along the road, in addition to rescuing wounded soldiers, and collecting wounded soldiers, they also supply tea and water at the rescue stations to help residents. Female team members also go to hospitals to take care of the wounded soldiers and repair their clothes. The local health work of various groups is also assisted by the team to the best of its ability. There are also rescue training courses to cultivate new cadres. Singing to the wounded soldiers and helping the people to organize joint parties… All of these are within the scope of their work.

Recently, they were ordered to go from the South Xun route to Xiangbei. Now, they are still active in the Changsha area.

Commendable and Touching Facts

The soldiers on the front line with flowers are, of course, a bit irritable, but their emotion of killing × is very high. When family members visit the wounded soldiers in the hospital, not only do they not show sadness, but they also comfort each other very kindly, which makes people unable to help but shed tears. In the Zhuang Ding training camp, when it is time to go to war, the old father encourages his grandchildren, and the wife encourages her husband. It is most decent for a man to defeat the × people, without any worries. Those who are watching are all moved by it. The transportation after the war of resistance is also making rapid progress. From any aspect, it shows that we are fighting stronger and stronger, and final victory is absolutely guaranteed. Therefore, when Wang Jingwei issued a surrender telegram, the soldiers and civilians on the front line were extremely angry and held forums to issue telegrams condemning Wang's treachery. — From this, we can see who is deviating from the demands of the people, and who is the one who is abandoned.

Three Difficulties and Prospects

Captain Wu also reported three difficulties and prospects of the work:

First, the lack of manpower — such a vast war zone, the strength of dozens of people is not enough to distribute. How to quickly transport the wounded soldiers from the front line to the rear? How to make the wounded soldiers shed less blood and reduce the pain? This only hopes that the people in the rear will actively go to the front line to serve.

Second, the lack of hygiene and medicine — it is important to save the wounded soldiers, and it is even more important to save the old soldiers, because they have rich combat experience and the emotions of resistance like the eruption of a volcano. However, the most common festering disease — and "dysentery"... the lack of medicine is deeply felt, and it is hoped that overseas Chinese will enthusiastically donate.

Third, the lack of transportation — an ambulance from the front line to the rear, it only takes five or six hours to go back and forth once, and only a few wounded soldiers are transported. The means of transportation is really not enough to apply. This also requires the help of overseas Chinese.

In response to this serious fact that personnel and medicines need to be supplemented, Captain Wu does not hesitate to travel hard from Jiangxi via Zhejiang and Fujian to Hong Kong. He will lead the second batch of 20 team members to Shaoguan during the day, serving in the Wu Qiwei troops in the Dongjiang area. The reporter sincerely hopes that the patriotic bridge compatriots, looking forward to victory and the glorious tomorrow, will provide this group of brave and hardworking rescuers with spiritual and material assistance. If the war of resistance is not over for one day, our responsibility will not be over for one day!

Transportation and Travel

### A Journey to Northern Fujian

— Recorded by Wang Qixi

In the spring of the 27th year [of the Republic], I and Mr. Zhao Zhiming accompanied a materials vehicle from the Jianyang Automobile Repair Factory, traveling directly from Fuzhou to Jianyang. At that time, both the Min-Gu Road and the Ou-Gu Road sections were not yet open to traffic (the Min-Gu Road runs from Fuzhou to Zhatian to Xi, and was not yet open; while the Ou-Gu Road runs from Gutian to Jian'ou and only recently opened to traffic). Therefore, the road surface was very rough, and coupled with the mud softened by the rain, the journey was difficult. Of the two vehicles traveling together, one broke down halfway and was stranded on the road for more than ten days. We also experienced many hardships before finally reaching Jianyang, which was considered fortunate!

After arriving in Jianyang, we went north to Chong'an to explore the scenic beauty of Mount Wuyi. It was the plum rain season, but fortunately, the weather was kind, and there were two days of clear skies, allowing us to see the famous mountain in the sunshine. On the way back south, we took a boat from Nanping along the Jianxi River, and got to see the perils of the upper reaches of the Min River. The experiences along the way were quite worthy of discussion. Now that the Fujian Provincial Government has relocated to the interior, the status of northern Fujian has become even more important, so our trip should be of interest to readers.

Day 1: Fuzhou to Gutian

This time, two freight trucks went to Jianyang, one a 'Benz' diesel truck and the other a 'Chevrolet' gasoline truck, both fully loaded with materials. Director Li of the repair factory had previously sent a letter inviting me to travel, and I then invited Mr. Zhao to join me. Mr. Wang, the material handler, and I rode on the diesel truck. The other truck was driven by Mr. Xue. Both trucks were originally supposed to depart at the same time, but due to different speeds, they gradually separated. Our truck took the lead.

It was drizzling lightly. The freight trucks had no seats or canopies. We were like cargo piled on the truck. We knew that traveling on an unopened highway would be difficult, so this trip would be arduous, but the hardship would be all the more enjoyable.

The truck left through the West Gate. The highway was mostly built along the mountains, and the project was 80-90% complete. The only remaining work was the road surface and bridges. Therefore, we were driving on a loose and unstable road surface and temporary bridges. Fortunately, the driver's skills were excellent, and the journey was relatively smooth. In the afternoon, the truck passed Xuefeng, where there is a famous large temple that we could see from the truck.

After passing Xuefeng, the highway mostly winds up the mountains. The construction project can be described as massive. When the truck reached the mountain top, it felt like ascending to great heights, and a little carelessness could result in utter destruction. Occasionally, rocks would fall in front of the truck, and we had to find a way to remove them before we could proceed. However, there were even greater difficulties. The sand and soil laid on the road turned into mud after the rain. It is not difficult to imagine the result of a heavy truck driving in the mud. We could only see the wheels slipping, and the truck could not move an inch.

However, we really could not allow the truck to break down, because even if it was stranded for ten days or so on this highway, it would be of no use. Every time, we had to get out of the truck and work on the road ourselves, either filling it with dirt or covering it with turf. Sometimes, we walked for several miles and hired villagers to help push the truck. Fortunately, each section of muddy road was only three or four yards long, and the difficulties could still be overcome. This kind of situation happened no less than five or six times in one day.

At 6 p.m., we arrived in Gutian and parked the truck in an ancient temple used by the highway construction team. We also borrowed their telephone to inquire about the other truck, and learned that it was still at Luoqiao.

Gutian is a major county in northern Fujian. It is said that there is a large waterfall outside the city, famous throughout the country, which can be used for hydropower in both provinces. That night, we stayed in a hotel in the city. The city also had electric lights, but the voltage was not uniform, resulting in varying brightness. When it was dim, it was only like a red thread, so we had to constantly switch to light bulbs with different voltages, or else add candles.

Day 2: Gutian to Jian'ou

We set off early in the morning in the rain, proceeding along the Ou-Gu Road. The highway wound up the mountains, turning and twisting, even more dangerous than the previous day. At noon, we passed a steep mountain road. The mud was slippery in the rain, and we could not move forward. We got out of the truck to build the road with our bare hands. The labor was hard but fruitless, and the wheels sank deeper and deeper, making it impossible to drive. We had not eaten since morning, and our stomachs were very hungry, so we rested in a cowshed and ate some dry rations, hoping for unexpected help, because there was no other way.

As expected, our wish came true. In the afternoon, seven or eight workers came, carrying tools and rice cookers, seemingly on a long journey. After inquiring, we learned that they were originally road construction workers on this section, and now that their work was completed, they were heading to Chong'an. This trip would take about seven or eight days. We discussed with them and agreed to let them ride in the truck to Jianyang after they helped us get the truck out of danger. This arrangement was mutually beneficial, because if they rode in the truck, they could build the road at any time, and their travel expenses and time would also be reduced several times.

This group of workers had tools, so they made rapid progress, like pioneers clearing the way. Moreover, they were very familiar with the nearby workers. Through their efforts, more than twenty people were gathered, and they pulled the truck out of the mud and continued forward.

After that, when there were road obstacles or excessively steep slopes, this group of workers would get out of the truck and push it to help overcome the lack of power. When the truck reached Yushan, it was getting late. The mountain was high and the wind was cold, and the sea of clouds was vast. The personnel at the highway office advised us to spend the night there, but we decided to continue forward due to various inconveniences, and drove at night with the lights on.

This section of the road was slightly flatter, and it was planned to open to traffic soon, so there were traffic signs along the way. Where there were curves, where there were slopes, where there were bridges, and where there were dangers, we could get advance notice. At night, this was better than a compass. That night, the truck arrived in Jian'ou at 8 p.m.

Jian'ou is an important county in northern Fujian, so at that time there was talk of the provincial government moving to Jian'ou. Its main products are rice, paper, bamboo, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and wood. Shiitake mushrooms are cultivated artificially. It is said that the mushroom cultivation workers are all from a certain county in Zhejiang, and it has become a hereditary specialized occupation. Every year when the mushroom cultivation season begins, no less than tens of thousands of these workers go deep into the mountains.

In addition, Jian'ou also produces a kind of square bamboo, which can be used for making tobacco pipes and walking sticks. It can be used for elegant play, and its price is also quite expensive, depending on the fineness of the carving.

That night, we stayed in a hotel in Jian'ou and chatted and laughed happily, because we had already overcome all kinds of difficulties, and we would be able to reach Jianyang tomorrow.

Day 3: Jian'ou to Jianyang

Jian'ou to Jianyang is 50 kilometers. This section of the highway had already been opened to traffic, and the driver was very familiar with the road conditions. We departed from Jian'ou at about 8 a.m., and at about 10 a.m., we saw a pagoda, knowing that we had reached Jianyang. The truck arrived at the repair factory, where Mr. Li and Mr. Shen greeted us. The two gentlemen had been my colleagues in Shanghai for many years, and we were very happy to see each other. We moved our luggage to the dormitory next to the factory for a temporary stay.

That day was Sunday, so we went to Mr. Li's house for lunch. Mr. Li was newly married and lived in Jianyang, very close to the factory. His wife treated us very warmly, which was deeply appreciated. After the meal, we heard a bell, knowing that it was an air raid alarm, but we did not see any planes.

In the afternoon, it was cloudy and rainy again. Led by Mr. Li, we took a car to see the road conditions in the city. The highways here are well-connected, running 118 kilometers south to Yanping and 61 kilometers north to Chong'an. To the west, it goes through Shaowu to Guangze, 110 kilometers. From Guangze to Nanchang in Jiangxi, it is 275 kilometers. To Pucheng, it is 117 kilometers, and from Pucheng to Jiangshan in Zhejiang, it is 112 kilometers. Jianyang is the center of all roads, so automobile repair is the best in northern Fujian, and the work is also very busy. Mr. Li said that every year during mountain floods, many bridges at the streams along the roads are washed away, causing vehicles to be unable to pass, and the work of the repair factory is temporarily suspended. However, the streams and bridges we saw at that time were still two or three yards away from the water, so we did not expect the floods to be so severe when they came.

Jianyang does not yet have a power plant, so the machines in the repair factory are all powered by their own generators. The work and management are successful, and it is said that another generator will be added soon. At night, it is very dark because there are no street lights. Mr. Li invited me to stay in his house in the city, but I politely declined, and stayed in the staff dormitory near the car factory, sharing a room with Mr. Zhao. Mr. Wang and Mr. Shen were both friends, so it was not lonely. The dormitory was upstairs. The joint security office was downstairs, and there were many pots of orchids in the courtyard. I remembered that the homes we had seen during the day also had simple decorations, because Fujian also produces orchids, of a special kind called "Jianlan," with broad and strong leaves, more than two feet long. In early autumn, flower stalks emerge, with several flowers on the upper part of the stem. They are light yellowish-green in color, and have a subtle fragrance. The orchids of Jianyang must be unique to the local soil, because orchids live in secluded valleys, and this place also benefits from the beauty of the mountains and waters.

Day 4: Jianyang

When I woke up in the morning, I did not see the sunlight, and the heavy rain of the night had not yet stopped. The planned trip to Wuyi could not be made, so Mr. Zhao and I went to visit the city. The city walls of Jianyang have not yet been demolished, but the area is not large. In less than half a day, we had visited the county government, the bus station, the four city gates, and the streets.

The local products of Jianyang include shiitake mushrooms, winter bamboo shoots, mustard greens, "kou lian" [lotus seeds], and tea. The mustard greens can grow to be two feet tall, and have a very rich flavor. "Kou lian" are lotus seeds without the bitter core, which has been sucked out one by one by female workers, hence the name "kou lian" [mouth lotus]. The tea is all picked from Mount Wuyi, and there are many varieties, such as Mingzhong, Baijiguan, Shuixianzhong, Dahongpao, and Tieguanyin. Dahongpao is the most famous and expensive. Mr. Zhao bought a two-ounce package for two yuan, which would be twice the price elsewhere.

In addition to local products, there are also goods transported from Zhejiang. We bought two umbrellas from a store, preparing to brave the rain to visit Mount Wuyi tomorrow. The paper umbrellas of Fuzhou are indeed very famous, but what we bought was an umbrella from Hangzhou, because since the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway opened to traffic, the transportation between Fujian and Zhejiang has become very convenient.

In the evening, Mr. Li and others hosted a banquet for me and Mr. Zhao. During the dinner, we talked a lot about Jianyang, and learned that there is a place where Zhu Xi [a famous Song dynasty scholar] studied, and we also planned to visit it if we had the opportunity. We also heard that Jianyang has a lot of malaria, and many workers in the factory suffer from this disease, so the factory always has medicine on hand, and the bottles of "aspirin" are always empty.

Day 5: Jianyang to Mount Wuyi (Chong'an)

Today, the weather cleared up, which was beyond our expectations. We took a truck to visit Mount Wuyi. Jianyang to Gongguan is 45 kilometers, and Gongguan to Chishi is another 8 kilometers. However, due to the long-term rain, the bridge at Chishi was washed away by the water. The truck could not reach Chong'an directly, and we had to cross the stream on a bamboo raft and walk four or five li to reach Chishi. Chishi is a famous tea market in China, but it has suffered from war, and nine out of ten houses are empty, showing a depressed scene. When we arrived in Chishi, it was almost noon, so we had some noodles and hired a local boy as a guide to enter the Wuyi Mountains.

Mount Wuyi is thirty li (Chinese miles) south of Chong'an County. It is the starting point of the Cathaysia Mountain Range. According to legend, there was a deity named Lord Wuyi who lived here, hence the name. The entire mountain range stretches for 120 li and has 36 peaks and 37 rocks. Along the way, we passed Toad Rock, Three Maidens Rock, and Umbrella Peak, and arrived at Yongle Chan Temple in Tianxin. This is the center of the entire mountain, and visitors must first come here. We were greeted by the guest master, Monk Qingxi, and stayed in a guest room in front of the temple.

After the meal, we toured Eagle Beak Peak, passed Daxin Ridge, and arrived at Liuguanzhai. We heard that the famous Dahongpao tea is produced here. Then we passed the Yanzhan Peak and arrived at the Water Curtain Cave. The rock is a hundred yards high, looking like a hanging curtain. A spring pours down from the top of the rock, creating a water curtain, like scattered pearls and jade, which is a wonder to behold. Next to it is Shentong Rock.

We passed Liuxiang Stream, which is full of fragrant grasses and secluded orchids, hence the name. We arrived at Seven Stars Rock, which has a suspended pavilion. It is said that it was once the residence of Taoists practicing here, but now it is deserted. The so-called pavilion is actually a small house suspended in the air. However, the dangerous rock is more than a hundred feet high, and there is no path to reach it. I don't know how this small house was built or how people lived in it.

Tea trees are planted all over the mountains, mostly less than a foot tall, and the tallest ones are only three or four feet tall. The tea gardens are all built on rocks, piled with mountain soil. Because of the beautiful environment of clouds and rocks, the world-famous rock tea grows here. When the tea season arrives in the spring, the mountains are full of tea pickers, singing mountain songs, which will be a completely different sight.

After returning to the temple, the monks offered us a rare variety of tea to taste. The guest master, Qingxi, was said to have come from the military, but his conversation was very elegant and zen-like.

Day 6: Mount Wuyi

The rock scenery of Mount Wuyi is best at Tianxin and Tianyou, and the water scenery is best at the Nine Bend Stream. Tianyou is currently building a central park, and we will visit it today.

In the morning, the monks hired a worker to guide us, and we passed Leishi Rock, which is named because three rocks lean against each other. Next to it is Leishi Jingjin. Then we went to Matou Rock, below which is Ningyun Taoist Temple. The peach blossoms and flowing water in front of the gate are extraordinary. An old Taoist lives there. Mount Wuyi is one of the thirty-six caves of Taoism, so there are many Taoist temples in the mountains.

Then we passed Wudao Stream, Huma Stream, and other places. At noon, we arrived at Tianyou, where there are many stone carvings with poems by ancient people. There was originally a Chan temple here, but it was destroyed by fire and is now being rebuilt. Climbing to the top, we could see the winding streams. Below were the scenic spots of Jinji Cave. According to its direction, it should be between the sixth and seventh bends.

After touring Tianyou, we returned to Tianxin Temple, passing Sanyang Peak on the way, which is the highest peak in the entire mountain. The peak rises three times, like the shape of a pen holder. The guide said that there is a dangerous cave on it, inhabited by Taoists practicing here, which is not easy to find. Is this the ancient poem that says, "Only in this mountain, but unknown where because of the deep clouds"?

At that time, there were more than ten children, playing drums and holding lanterns, traveling in the mountains. It was not lonely to have such companions on the mountain. Asking them, we learned that they were from Xingcun, and this trip was to offer incense at Tianxin Temple. Xingcun is more than twenty li away from here and is also a famous tea market.

In the evening, there was a sign of rain, and the mountain god came out for a tour. For several days, the monks of the temple had been very hospitable, providing tea, snacks, rice, and meals, all complete. At night, the atmosphere was very cold, and it even snowed. Mr. Zhao and I sat around the stove and chatted, and composed a poem together:

It is magnificent to see the famous mountains,
This trip is mainly to taste tea.
The water curtain of pearls and jade pours from the sky,
The essence of the rocks has been open since ancient times.
The green trees pick fragrance in the spring should be lively,
The legacy of the [Japanese] bandits makes the scenery sad.
Tomorrow we will buy a raft and say goodbye to the monks,
The Nine Bend Stream will be returned in one day.

Day 7: Wuyi to Jianyang

In the morning, it rained, so we braved the rain to tour the Nine Bend Stream. The stream is very shallow, with pebbles underneath. We had to float on a bamboo raft, and we could also appreciate the fun of traveling along the stream. Examining the Mount Wuyi map, there are many scenic spots along the stream. I have specially recorded them for reference:

First Bend - First Bend Painting Academy, Zhizhi Hermitage, Dengxian Terrace, Wuyi Palace.

Second Bend - Jade Maiden Peak, Lingxiao Peak, Yanxian Rock.

Third Bend - Five Tiger Peak, Dazang Peak, Xiaozang Peak.

Fourth Bend - Heavenly Pillar Peak, Gengyi Terrace, Li Xian Rock, Royal Tea Garden, Tongxian Gorge, Xiamakeng, Great Guanyin, Small Guanyin, Fangyin Stone, Jingtai, Shumo Stone, Erhui Stone, Shangchenggao, Xiachenggao.

Fifth Bend - Song Wengong Temple, Da Wenping, Xianzhang Rock, Fuhudong, Luohan Cave, Xiao Wenping.

### A Conspiracy to Eliminate Our Silk Industry

— Wu Ma

In short, although the conditions are only five, they are truly venomous and ferocious, enough to completely destroy the little silk foundation China has. If the operators of the silkworm egg farms in the war zone still have any conscience, if they can take a longer view, they should resolutely refuse. 3. Two Lines of Approach in the Future

I heard that after obtaining such favorable cooperative conditions, Da You Silkworm Egg Farm did not immediately accept them, but prepared to use the name of the Wuxian Silkworm Egg Industry Guild to petition the Construction Department of the puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government to express its opposition. It is certainly gratifying that the silkworm egg farm does not agree to cooperate with the Japanese side, but merely requesting assistance from the puppet government is not enough, regardless of whether this method is appropriate or not, solely in terms of its effectiveness. Because the traitors are too busy obeying "their masters," how dare they offer any opinions—this error in understanding seems inappropriate now, during the total war of national mobilization. Therefore, under such harsh pressure, how should the various farms cope? I can say that there is no other way except for absolute non-cooperation, but the so-called non-cooperation here does not simply mean closing down the silkworm egg farm and considering the matter finished.

### Prelude to the Hong Kong-Philippines Interport Game: Hong Kong Team Practice Match Today at 5 PM at the Navy Ground, Tickets Cost 20 Cents

[Special Report from This Newspaper] The date of the Hong Kong-Philippines interport football showdown is fast approaching, and the football fans will soon have a feast for the eyes.

The representatives of the Hong Kong Interport Team were selected on Monday evening based on the principle of choosing the best from the best by the selection committee of the General Association. Six Chinese players were chosen for the first team, and Lee Wai Tong was elected as the team captain. This is truly commendable.

The overall lineup has no unsatisfactory flaws. Although many people did not expect Zao La to be selected for the right-wing position, the reporter greatly agrees with this. As far as I know, the Filipino players are the most energetic and agile. They fear fast attacks and slow defense. Therefore, the Hong Kong team's front line must use one or two players who are good at sprinting to be the best strategy. Zao La was selected precisely because he is fierce in sprinting, and thus was appreciated by the selection committee.

The Navy team occupies two positions in the midfield, one is Dickson, and the other is Han Ni Wei Lu. The excellent skills of these two players have long been known to the general public. However, one point is worth noting: all of the Navy's midfielders prefer to dribble the ball and attack. Dickson and Han also share this style. In terms of football strategy, if the team does not use the third inside-forward method, then the center-back must attack to promote the advance of its own front line, but must still act cautiously. According to what I have heard, the Filipino team's front line is very fast and excels at surprise attacks. Therefore, Dickson and Han must be wary of this at the time.

At 5 PM today, the Interport Team will hold a practice match against the Hong Kong League Team at the Navy Stadium. In principle, the Interport Team should regard the Hong Kong League Team as its imaginary enemy, but its greatest goal should be to develop a consistent cooperative effort of the whole team and to understand the connections in each position's responsibilities. Only then will the meaning of this review not be lost.

This gathering of heroes will surely be pleasing to the eye. The ticket price is uniformly 20 cents, which is especially cheap. The lineups of the two teams are as follows: (Stadium Deity)

Interport Team

Tam Kwan Kan (South China Chinese)

Sze Hon (Middlesex), Lee Tin Sang (South China South)

Leung Wing Chiu (South China South), Dickson (Navy Team), Han Ni Wei Lu (Navy Team)

### South China Athletic Association Presells Tickets

The Hong Kong-Philippines Interport Football Match has been scheduled for the first, second, and fourth days of the Lunar New Year at the Navy Stadium. To avoid overcrowding when purchasing tickets at that time, the General Association has started selling tickets in advance and reservations can be made for seats. The South China Association has obtained the tickets for the best seats for these matches. They will be sold today at the association's billiard room in the Chinese Merchant Association Building and at the General Affairs Office of the association's gymnasium in Jia Shan to meet the needs of the members.

### Wing Yip Brand Mini-Soccer Tournament: Han Ying Wins, 3-1 Against Chinese Police

In the Wing Yip Brand mini-soccer tournament, the English team played against the police team at the Hutton Ground yesterday (8th) at 4 PM. After the start of the game, the Han Ying team's momentum was fierce, and they frequently attacked the Chinese Police team. Guo Yingqi and Zhang successively scored goals. In the first half, the Han Ying team took the lead with a score of 2-0. After the break, the teams switched sides and fought again. The Chinese Police, having already lost ground, tried to make up for their losses in the late stages of the game, advancing on two fronts. Eventually, Shi Shicai scored a goal. To secure the victory, the Han Ying team's morale was boosted, and Chen Bingtu added another goal, making it 3-1. After that, the two teams exchanged attacks, but neither had another chance to score. At the end of the game, the Han Ying team triumphed with a score of 3-1.

### Basketball Referees Association: Recruiting Referees

After the recent re-election of the Hong Kong Basketball Referees Committee, the members are actively improving the association's affairs. Yesterday, the association held a meeting to discuss the issue of basketball referee talent. Many foreign basketball referees have come to Hong Kong. To increase the number of referee talents, the association is inviting foreign basketball referees who are willing to serve the Hong Kong basketball community to submit a letter to the association with their resume. After the Referee Committee reviews and approves their qualifications, they can join as members.

### Next Year's World Games to Include 147 Events in Total, with Numerous New Events for Men and Women, Budget Estimated at 200 Million Finnish Marks

(Helsinki, January 3rd Dispatch) Since Finland has been actively preparing for the next World Games, progress has been extremely rapid. The parliament has already passed a special budget to enrich the preparatory funds, with a total amount of 200 million Finnish marks (according to the current exchange rate, approximately £1 million or US$5 million). The remaining amount, totaling 100 million marks, has been supplemented by the Helsinki City Government. The municipal government is currently constructing the Olympic Village, located in a lush forest area in the suburbs, with fresh air and convenient transportation. The athletes' dormitories consist of 29 new three-story buildings with a total of 2,500 bedrooms. The dining hall for all representatives will also begin construction soon. The village's general office will be located in a primary school.

At the last World Games held in Berlin, there were 129 events. However, the program for the upcoming games in Finland will increase by three events. The total will include 23 track and field events, 8 indoor sports events, 16 swimming and water sports events, 4 rowing events, 4 yachting events, 9 small boat races, 14 wrestling events, 5 weightlifting events, 8 boxing events, 5 shooting events, 7 fencing events, 6 equestrian events, 1 soccer event, 2 gliding events, and 1 modern pentathlon event. At the previous World Games, there were competitions in handball, field hockey, polo, basketball, and women's indoor sports. In the upcoming games in 1940, the above events will be discontinued and replaced with other new events. These new events include: (1) 10,000-meter race walking, (2) women's shot put, (3) women's long jump, (4) women's 200-meter race. In addition, there will be two new rifle shooting events at 300 meters and 50 meters. The gliding competition is also a never-before-seen event. Therefore, the total number of events has reached 132. Adding 15 artistic competitions, the total is 147 events.

When the competitions are held in the future, major newspapers and news agencies around the world will send reporters to cover the event and report the daily competition status to the outside world. The organizing committee has decided to set up 600 seats in the stadium for the "uncrowned emperors" out of courtesy. The allocation of reporter seats will be based on the proportion of athletes from each country.

### Famous Chinese Soccer Referees Join the British Referees Association

[Shanghai Correspondence] Two famous Chinese soccer referees, Yue Xiurong and Shen Huichun, were introduced by the Shanghai Westerners' Soccer Association and joined the British Soccer Referees Association as members. The association has approved their membership, and their 1938-39 membership certificates have been mailed to Shanghai. In the future, Yue and Shen can perform duties in any competition under the jurisdiction of the British Soccer Referees Association. It is said that the Chinese referees who will be officiating in the next Westerners' First Division Tournament will also be introduced by the association to join the British Referees Association. It is noted that several Chinese referees have been introduced by the National Sports Advancement Association to join the International Soccer Referees Association as members, but Yue and Shen are the pioneers of Chinese referees becoming members of the British Referees Association.

### The Effectiveness of Morning Exercises

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Since participating in the second symposium of the Guangdong Provincial Institute of Physical Education alumni association in Hong Kong, I have been pondering about the sports situation in Hong Kong. This problem has been on my mind at all times and cannot be suppressed. "Morning exercises" are one of the things I pay the most attention to. Compatriots, everyone think about it, Hong Kong is a place where every inch of land is precious, and there is definitely a major problem in terms of air quality. In the past reports, the number of deaths from tuberculosis accounted for the largest number, which is the most obvious proof. To solve this problem, we certainly cannot seek external solutions - eating medicine and injections are certainly not fundamental solutions, we must find and study internally to get the most appropriate method, which is the most important, and everyone should practice "morning exercise."

Compatriots, everyone underestimates the most important "morning exercises" too much, and even many schools cannot pay attention to it, which is the most regrettable thing. Although the environment for sports in Hong Kong is not good - there are too few places to practice sports - we should not be overcome by the environment, but rather make full use of the environment to practice sports. For example, rooftops and alleys can be used as our sports fields, which is not impossible, it just depends on whether we know how to use them.

Whenever I go to any school or group, the sentence I like to say to the students the most is, "Go to morning exercise on time every day, don't be afraid of things going wrong." I earnestly hope that compatriots and comrades in sports can put my seemingly unreasonable words into practice, but when you really have the courage to practice them, you must also follow the rules of "going to bed on time" and "getting up on time."

### Understanding the Physical Training of Children

— Wang Xuezheng

In this world where the fittest survive and the weak are prey to the strong, brutal wars are unavoidable. If we do not want to be the parents of slaves, we must, from today onwards, actively train the physique of our children to prepare them for future calamities. Therefore, parents today should actively promote sports, not only to seek survival for the country, but also to seek the greatest happiness for their descendants.

A strong country must first have a strong race. Today, all countries in the world attach importance to sports. Strengthening the race must start with children.

Physical training methods for children are different from those for adults. This is not entirely because children are not able to handle adult sports, but because children have different needs in terms of body and mind. For example, walking and cycling are good exercises for adults. Although children also have enough physical strength to handle them, these exercises are not very suitable for children, because these exercises only benefit a part or a small part of the body, and cannot make the whole body develop evenly. Therefore, for children, it will cause the harm of uneven physical development. This harm is enough to affect the normal development or growth of children's bodies, as well as their future physique.

The most suitable exercise for children is systematic freehand exercises. These exercises should also vary depending on age and physical strength. Freehand exercises have great effects on children in terms of physical and ethical training, and can train children's self-confidence, will, ability to adapt to the environment, friendship, loyalty, and other qualities.

Freehand exercises are the most economical in terms of "time," "place," and "things," but there are still many children who do not have this opportunity due to environmental factors. Therefore, some people think that to promote this exercise, the greatest effect cannot be achieved unless the government, public organizations, and educational authorities such as schools implement it effectively. Although this is not without reason, the most effective method is to promote it effectively by the above-mentioned organizations on the one hand, and to make this atmosphere permeate into the family on the other hand. Parents should also have a deep understanding of the importance of health and this exercise.

In the curricula of middle schools and primary schools, physical education is a compulsory course, and sports are promoted by means of guidance and compulsion. However, the results are not significant, and even the number of victims is not small. The main reasons are nothing more than improper guidance, staff members failing to perform their duties, lack of deep understanding of physical education, and neglect of the relationship between exercise and age or individual physical needs. For example, applying adult or adolescent sports to children is a major mistake. There are countless other mistakes in methods.

Physical training is more important for children than for young people, adults, and the elderly. Childhood is not only the foundation of our life, but also the time when our bodies are not yet mature. Although physical training is very important, if the exercise method is slightly wrong, it will have a major damage to the body, and it will also have a great impact on the future.

Most children are active, but there are also very few who are not interested in sports. For the former, we should of course guide them in appropriate ways. The most regrettable thing is that we do not know how many children who love sports have had their great futures buried due to improper guidance. For the latter, we should inspire their interest and study the reasons why they are not interested in sports.

Do not be afraid to correct mistakes. As long as we are determined to improve, it is never too late for anything. We must pay close attention to the factors related to health or body, especially in childhood. In this period, if we develop bad habits, it will be difficult to get rid of them in adulthood. Physical training is also the same. Moreover, in childhood, we should develop good habits in daily life, first establish a strong foundation, and prepare to cope with future heavy burdens or harsh environments.

The main purpose of children's exercise is to improve health, with emphasis on the training of the trunk and internal organs. Muscle development is secondary.

As for the development of the physical and mental aspects, no two people are exactly the same. Therefore, there is no fixed standard for children's physical training, and of course, the different needs or different physical and mental development of each person cannot be ignored. The same exercise should not be applied to all of them. (To be continued)

### Movies and Theater

Entertainment……Dream Lover

The Shopworn Angel

The film depicts a young man and woman tossed about by different destinies. One is a sincere and honest farmer's son, about to be sent to the front lines of a ruthless war. The other is a gold-digging showgirl, her soul deeply scarred and her fate uncertain. Both seek fulfillment of their "dreams" amidst a frightening reality, and their dreamlike "love" provides them with much encouragement and comfort.

Margaret Sullavan plays a worldly gold-digging showgirl in this film. She sacrifices the attentions of a wealthy man who woos her and, under special circumstances, accepts the love of a sincere young man who has already enlisted. Although she fully understands that a love between herself, accustomed to a life of luxury and indulgence, and this simple young man is almost impossible, she marries him just before his departure to fulfill his dream.

The film vividly and realistically depicts the mobilization situation when the United States joined the European war and the social dynamics full of tense wartime atmosphere. Margaret Sullavan's excellent performance in "Three Comrades" left us with an indelible impression. In this film, her suitable character also results in a very satisfactory performance. James Stewart's acting in the film is as excellent and moving as in "Seventh Heaven." Walter Pidgeon's performance is also commendable.

Empress & Peace Together……Youth Takes a Fling

Youth Takes a Fling

The film depicts a sentimental shop assistant pursuing the man of her dreams. Unfortunately, the man is somewhat dull and only interested in his nautical career, paying attention to nothing else. Women are no exception. No matter how affectionate and lovely the shop assistant is, she can't win his favor. Eventually, he decides to avoid her entanglements altogether. However, the pain of seasickness shatters his nautical dream and cures him of his heartlessness.

Although the film tries its best to enrich its content with various scenes, such as fashion shows and public swimming pools, it still fails to completely conceal the emptiness of its content. As for the actors, Andrea Leeds still has a charming performance. As for Joe McСrea, who plays the young man obsessed with sailing, although his portrayal of the character is a bit exaggerated, he is the central figure of interest throughout the film.

Oriental……The Divorce of Lady X

The Divorce of Lady X

Produced by Alexander Korda of England. The story takes place at a banquet in a large London hotel, where a heavy fog prevents the guests from returning home. They borrow rooms from the hotel, but because there are not enough rooms, a young woman breaks into a single man's room. This is how the story unfolds. The performance is very humorous and has an American flavor. Merle Oberon's performance is just right. The male lead is a British star and his performance is mediocre.

Great China……Bluebeard's Eighth Wife

Bluebeard's Eighth Wife

The famous director Ernst Lubitsch has always directed many romantic comedies with his light and wonderful style. This film, which appears before us, suits his special talents. He handles it with ease and skill, and the results are quite excellent. Furthermore, with Gary Cooper and Claudette Colbert playing the male and female leads, it is like icing on the cake, making this film worth watching. Originally, Gary Cooper was known for playing Western cowboys. In this film, it seems that his talents are not fully utilized. Although he has tried his best, he still seems to be a bit inferior to Claudette Colbert.

New World……Modern Woman Seeking a Husband

Cantonese Film

Adapted from the stage play "Modern Woman Seeking a Husband." The story tells of a millionaire with a million-dollar fortune who is extremely stingy. Not only does he refuse to contribute to any public welfare undertakings, but he also tries to take advantage of others. At this time, various circles initiate fundraising to establish a refugee industrial factory and want to ask him for help. However, as a result, he not only does not take out any money, but also helps himself to several pastries at the meeting. Therefore, everyone devises this "Modern Woman Seeking a Husband" plan to trick him and then use female charms to seduce him.

The main actors are the famous stage performers, Ma Sze-tsang and Tam Lan-hing. It also shows the producer's business acumen.

The directing technique is still quite flexible.

Central……Hu Huigan Fights in the Machine Room

Cantonese Film

Because of the extremely good box office results of "Fang Shiyu Fights on the Stage," smart producers saw the business opportunity. This film is produced from that motivation.

Hu Huigan is weak and incompetent and is bullied by the people in the machine room. After his father is killed, they even want to seize his wife and younger sister. Forced by circumstances, Hu Huigan decides to leave the machine room and go to Shaolin Temple to learn martial arts so that he can take revenge in the future. After many hardships and dangers, he finally returns one day and avenges his father's death. The plot of this film is that simple. The director has no technique to speak of. Kwong Shan-siu changes his style to play Hu Huigan, and his performance is still acceptable. Xu Renxin has been away from the screen for a long time. In this film, she makes a comeback, and her performance is good. The sets in the whole film are too simple, and the fight scenes are not tense enough.

Lee Theatre & Ko Shing Theatre Together……Hua Mulan

Cantonese Film

The plot depicts a modern woman who, because she has performed the stage play "Hua Mulan," always wants to be a modern "Hua Mulan." Sure enough, when the national crisis is severe, she realizes her ambition. The reason is that she discovers a well-organized traitor organization. Therefore, she and her lover Kwong Shan-siu work together to break this secret organization and steal documents. No one knows how many difficulties they have gone through, but they finally achieved their goal. Even the clever and confused traitors are moved by their great spirit and set off to the front lines together.

We do not deny that this plot is one of the better ones in South China, but it is still quite far-fetched. The director cannot utilize film techniques. The acting skills of Kwong Shan-siu and Chan Wan-sheung are very poor.

Taiping……The Heroic Children

Mandarin Film

Because there are no irrational elements like in monster movies, this film by Xinhua Company is not too bad, although it can't be said to be very good either. Many places in the play that should have been tense were passed over blandly. Koo Lan-chun, the actress who became very popular after the war, performed fairly well.

### View of Right and Wrong

— Mo Xie

This is right, and that is wrong. Right and wrong are inherently difficult to define. Some even say that right is wrong and wrong is right. What is right here may be wrong there, and vice versa. Women being fair-skinned and tall is considered beautiful in most civilized countries, but in Africa, black and short is the epitome of beauty. There are countless other examples.

Because each side insists on its own right and denies the other's, and because they cannot agree on what is right and wrong, disputes, quarrels, and even fights arise between individuals. Between countries, protests, severing ties, and even war break out over disputes about right and wrong, leading to "trouble."

But is there really no standard for right and wrong? Not necessarily. There is always a standard. As far as beauty is concerned, loving beauty and hating ugliness is universal, even though the standards of beauty and ugliness may differ. Furthermore, throughout history, both in China and abroad, there have always been many unchanging truths that define the scope of right and wrong, as unbreakable as the fact that humans eat food and dogs eat excrement. These unchanging truths include benevolence, righteousness, peace, justice, etc. No one dares to say, or will say, that these virtues are bad or "wrong," and that we should not develop but eliminate them.

However, "clever people"—who are actually shameless individuals—have the ability to distort facts and reverse right and wrong. They call aggression "friendship." They call selling out the nation "seeking national survival." They call monopoly and hegemony "maintaining common interests" and "open door policy." They call others their slaves, to be used by them, but say they are their friends, sharing glory and wealth. In short, they know clearly what is right and what is wrong, but they do not hesitate to make wrong into right and right into wrong. And they want others to be as ignorant of right and wrong as they are and blindly follow their version of right and wrong.

I think if they continue to act recklessly like this, perhaps one day it will become a habit. Their conscience will be extinguished, and they will genuinely recognize wrong as right and right as wrong. Therefore, when we want to eat food, they may say that food is inedible and that we should eat excrement instead, or that excrement is food, or even that they have always eaten excrement and will continue to eat it in the future.

Recently, it is said that this group of troublemakers is using their silver tongues everywhere, turning black and white upside down, and spreading their heresies, wanting us to "cooperate" with them and take their right and wrong as our own. I think, "The heart that knows right and wrong is in everyone." We are unlikely to be fooled by them. "Those who have no sense of right and wrong are not human!" Those who echo heresies become people who don't eat food, but dogs who eat excrement!

### Small Shadow

— Jin Yu

In the messy luggage, I found a small photo.

Looking at this small photo, a wave of emotion surges in my fragile heart, bringing to mind the beautiful and glorious early chapters of his life.

Under the bright lights, doesn't his youthful face appear? Who would believe that such a handsome warrior, fighting for justice, would have his life cruelly snatched away by a merciful God?

The bombing on the Izumo warship, the night attack over Taihu Lake.

Is that just a legend? The air battles to defend Wuhan, the long march across the East China Sea, how much glory did he win back for the people of his motherland! He had a good environment, he had a happy family, and his youthful years should have been so blissful. But for the survival of his country and people, he finally took his precious life and perished with the × enemy warships in the rolling Yangtze River!

Doesn't the inscription under the small photo clearly read: "I urged myself early to join the army, vowing not to return without beheading Loulan!" How is it that the ink of the inscription is still so fresh, while his precious life has left the world forever.

Amidst the cluttered review, a faint sadness inevitably surfaces in my heart. Besides regretting the brevity of his youthful years, I also feel that the people who live in the island country of cherry blossoms are a group of damnable things!

The heroic face in the small photo fills my heart with sorrow and hatred. The sounds of the anti-Japanese war seem to mock my weakness as pitiful.

### Unofficial History of Taiwan

— Zou Xiao

……Folk Novel

This book was written by Jiang Risheng in the early Qing Dynasty. It tells the story of Zheng Chenggong and his descendants. It begins with a preface by Chen Qiyong of Minyuan in Kangxi's Jia Shen year and a "Genealogy of the Zheng Family." There are editions published by the Qiu Wu Bu Huo Zhai, the Shanghai Shenbao Press, and the Wenming Bookstore's Stone-Printed Notes on Novels, totaling thirty volumes. Each volume is accompanied by a seven-character couplet, indicating that each volume is treated as a chapter. This is the only chapter-based novel included in the "Notes on Novels," but strictly speaking, if the seven-character couplet chapter titles are removed, this book is not very different from ordinary classical Chinese notes like "Stealing Anger Records."

Because this is a work from the early Qing Dynasty, perhaps to avoid falling foul of literary censorship, the person who wrote the preface inevitably shows bias towards the foreign race: "Chenggong was granted the surname of Longwu and fled overseas. For thirty-seven years, he upheld righteousness and maintained his integrity, almost the choice of Tian Heng. However, from the perspective of our dynasty, he was merely a surviving soul of the defeated kingdom, a desolate spirit in the corner of the sea. Judging him by the standards of resisting our rule, what more can be said? We respectfully observe our Emperor's divine achievements and sacred brilliance, surpassing all ages. Zheng was punished for rebelling and appeased when he submitted. We also look up to the Emperor's boundless benevolence and extraordinary grace, completing the unification of China and foreign lands, establishing the foundation for billions of years." I believe that even under the pressure of the environment, words like the above still exceeded the scope of tolerance. It seems that these few words were not said unwillingly, but rather with a flattering component. In this case, we have no way to defend Chen Qiyong.

Jiang Risheng is from Fujian, and writing about Fujian affairs from the perspective of a Fujianese, of course, there are many materials that people from other provinces would not know. Recently, Yu Zongxin's "Ming Yanping Prince's Taiwan Sea Kingdom Records" used this book as one of the important materials.

This book takes Zheng Chenggong and his descendants as the warp, and the turmoil at the end of the Ming Dynasty as the weft. Notable examples include Volume 4, which writes about Emperor Chongzhen hanging himself on Coal Hill, and Volume 5, which writes about "Huang Daozhou's Death in Nanjing."

Zheng Chenggong's part is only from Volume 6 to Volume 12. In these seven volumes, only Volumes 10 to 12 are relatively tense. Because it is written in classical Chinese and the imagination is not rich, there are few successes. Gan Hui, who is depicted with more effort, also cannot show his personality. But this book seems to be a little better than "Qifeng's Compilation."

Jiang Risheng's attitude is the same as the person who wrote the preface. For example, Volume 6 says: "Chenggong commanded Ma Xi, Gan Hui, etc., to attack Tong'an," "The power of the bandits was vast." Referring to Zheng Chenggong as a bandit, and considering Zheng Chenggong's desire to restore the lost land as invading troops crossing the border. Volume 10 says: "Liang Huafeng followed the sea bandits straight into Guazhen, then detoured to Jiangnan." Even in the tone of a third-person observer, Zheng Chenggong is still called a sea bandit, which is a regrettable thing. But the author does not have excessive insults towards Zheng Chenggong. Some people even say that the author "implies a subtle meaning of pessimism," which is somewhat comforting.

### Review

— Su Geng

—Behind-the-Lines Notes, Part Two—

Last night, I received a phone call from headquarters, saying that a certain commander-in-chief would personally visit City C today to review the civilian-dressed troops of Jin County. Therefore, the brothers got up especially early today.

As soon as the reveille sounded, the brothers got up one by one. Each person rubbed their sleepy eyes, put on their clothes, and tied their leggings. After that, everyone was busy tidying up their bedding, folding their blankets, and laying out their mats. Everyone was running around, and the entire unit was shrouded in a busy atmosphere. A rare solemn expression appeared on everyone's face.

Just as the clock struck seven, all the brothers in the large team were armed. After an inspection, they set off on the highway one or two li away from the team headquarters. The entire team was lined up on the highway.

Wang Sanzi, a vendor who set up a stall by the highway, was driven away by the soldiers who were sent out to maintain order. He moved his vendor's stall to an open space at the intersection of Chen Zhuang Road, staring blankly at the many people on the highway here, with a strange expression on his face. Yes, he still didn't know why the soldiers wouldn't let him set up a stall by the highway and drove him to this intersection. Moreover, the strange thing that so many people with guns suddenly appeared on the highway today also made him feel confused. However, based on his "intelligence" and past experience, he judged that some high-ranking official must be coming...

Before eight o'clock arrived, a long highway was already filled with armed soldiers. The noisy voices of talking echoed in the sunlight of the winter morning. The early winter sunlight, with golden light threads, warmly shone on the people. The people were enthusiastically restless under the golden light threads of the sun.

All the brothers of the Second Large Team gathered on the highway, waiting for the review by a certain commander-in-chief. As the waiting time grew longer, the brothers became anxious. The solemn atmosphere began to turn into relaxed conversation!

"Hey, Lao Hu. Why hasn't he come yet?" This was Xie Haishan's question.

"Hmm, he'll be here soon, don't be anxious." Lao Hu, standing in the front row of Xie Haishan, glanced at the highway ahead and answered him casually.

There were more people on the highway. All kinds of armed troops were gathered here. The stretcher teams also all set off.

A team wearing plain clothes, each with a hoe, rake, and iron shovel on their shoulders, marched in a mighty manner. Everyone was wearing a straw hat, and their rough and simple faces had a slightly flustered expression, causing the brothers to burst into laughter. Xie Haishan, standing behind Lao Hu, said with a smile:

"What are they doing here? Are we calling them to the front lines to farm?"

"The common people! The common people's… destruction team!"

"Destroy what?" Xie Haishan said, looking at their retreating figures.

"Des…destroy the highway! When the Japanese devils come, they destroy the highway." Lao Hu was relatively clear-headed. He knew the strength of the common people, so he did not doubt the strength of the destruction team, but he did not understand the role of the destruction team, so he could only use the words that Captain Wu told him the day before yesterday to answer Xie Haishan.

Suddenly, the firecrackers in front went off, and then the military music also sounded. The news that the commander-in-chief was coming was quietly transmitted in the team. The relaxed minds of the brothers became tense again. The noisy conversation was immediately replaced by a solemn atmosphere.

The commander-in-chief arrived at the station, got out of his private car, and slowly walked over with the welcoming officials. The military music followed behind them, playing leisurely. The brothers stood straight, and a solemn atmosphere enveloped the entire surroundings. The team was deathly silent, only the frantic beating of the brothers' hearts could be heard.

The sun was hanging in the sky, and golden threads of sunlight were floating in the sky. The commander-in-chief was welcomed to the headquarters, and the review ended. The brothers, with excited and weary hearts, walked back to the team headquarters. That team of destruction workers also each put on their straw hats, and carried their hoes, rakes, and iron shovels on their shoulders, and walked back to their old homes.

January 16, 1939, at the Eighth District Headquarters

### Ruins and Gunsmoke

— By Shiro Ozaki, Translated by Huanping Lin

Upon entering Poyang Lake, the color of the water changed as we watched. How many days had it been since we had seen clear water? The temperature was also hot. Just watching the long flow of the Yangtze River in a daze, my heart was extremely bitter.

However, here there were cloud shadows reflected in the water. I looked up at the sky. Gleaming cloud lines. It had never been so beautiful as it was today. The temperature did not suddenly drop, but the natural scenery that came into view was full of freshness, as if I was seeing it for the first time. I saw it everywhere. My heart was filled with a melancholic homesickness that could not be cut off or sorted out. In Hukou, there was the headquarters of the Yangtze River Fleet of the Navy. If Anqing was the first foothold in the upstream battle, then Hukou could be said to be the second foothold in forcing Jiujiang. As the port gradually approached, the antique charm of the town also emerged like a penetrating dye. The deep cliffs surrounded the town like city walls, and the color of the red earth seen under the rocks shone dazzlingly in the sunlight. Perhaps the most unbelievable thing was that it was more ancient than any city along the Yangtze River we had passed through so far. Anyone could see this at a glance. As soon as we arrived at the docking station headquarters, we were immediately led by Colonel Inoue to inspect the town for a week. The steep rocky mountain standing on the left-hand side was the famous Shizhong Mountain (Stone Bell Mountain). The National Government seemed to be desperately burying it as a military stronghold. The headquarters of the former Chinese Navy was there. The small port was piled high with small boats. Soldiers wearing tight-fitting clothes were loading and unloading cargo. Colonel Inoue pointed at them and said:

"Those are not conscripted soldiers, they are boatmen who volunteered."

That being said, the movement of the whole was expanding freely without being aware of it. Even if there were unusable points in the movements, the mood was good. The naturally generated control made every gesture and movement beneficial to survival, or so it felt to me. When the Japanese army landed, the residents of the town, like everywhere else, had all fled. Almost a month had passed today, and there were no signs of them coming back. All that was left were the temple keeper of Shizhong Mountain and an old servant woman with a child. No matter what we said, we couldn't communicate with them. They wouldn't eat anything we gave them either. The temple keeper devoutly held the small Buddha statue and worshipped it day and night. He was probably eating grass roots or something similar. By changing personnel and things, we tried to approach them, but they did not accept our kindness at all, so now, we simply ignored them.

Colonel Inoue, who was over fifty and had a beautiful, half-white moustache, said to me like this?

"So, are they spies?" I asked.

"—At the beginning, we were also wary: but we did not discover any signs of them being spies. I think that perhaps their will is strengthened by a long-term belief (—referring to the belief in resisting Japan—Translator)."

Besides this old woman living in the ruined city, only the family of the pastor remained in the French church. In addition to the troops responsible for security, there were also more than two hundred coolies used by the army. Although they were paid with military scrip, they could not use it because there were no residents. As for Japanese people other than the military, there were only a couple who had come from the mainland four or five days ago to run a photography business. The young couple seemed to have a very good relationship. Lieutenant Furutaka, who looked like a generous savage, laughed and said this:

"It's unlikely that they can do much business with the army as their target. In short, it's troublesome—seeing them sleeping in in the morning, it's also cautious, and at night, what is it like? Also cautious." (To be continued)
