### The Current State of the Youth Liberation Movement of Weak and Small Nations Worldwide

— Written by J. Gordon, English · World Youth Review ·

(I) The Deception and Incitement of Aggressors from Japan, Germany, and Italy among Weak and Small Nations

The youth in ×× are in turmoil. The youth and student movements in ××, ×××, and the ×× Islands are unfolding in a fierce struggle to eradicate poverty and ignorance, and to improve the future of democracy. They share the same views and participate in the same struggles as the youth of Western democracies. However, the fascist countries often use cynicism and treacherous tactics to turn them against their allies in the fight for freedom, peace, and against fascism.

Since ××× and ×× sold out weak and small nations in Munich, the German and Italian fascist governments have greatly intensified their demands for colonies. From specialized treatises explaining the "need for population expansion" to outright coercion and intimidation, they have exhausted every possible effort to expand this movement. However, while continuing their policy of aggression, they still attempt to gain the support of the colonial people. When Hitler demanded the return of African colonies, he pretended to be a protector of Arabs and Indians, but at the same time, in the same breath, he said that Jews, blacks, and colonial people are inferior races to the Aryan race. Mussolini demanded Tunisia on one hand, and on the other hand, styled himself as the protector of Islam. Japanese warlords massacred tens of millions of Chinese people on one hand, but on the other hand, called on the people of India, the Malay Archipelago, Siam, Annam, and Burma to unite behind them to oppose "Western white imperialism." Even General Franco occasionally professed himself to the Arabs as their protector. Most of this braggadocious propaganda is directed at the youth in the colonies, especially students.

Fascists have cast various baits among the Arab youth. Recently, Baldur Sohiradh, the leader of the Hitler Youth, traveled to the Near East to connect with the youth of Syria and Iraq. At a welcome meeting in Damascus, he called on the Syrian youth to adopt the methods and procedures of the National Socialist Party in their struggle for the people. Mussolini and Hitler spend thousands of pounds each month to buy Arab newspapers to spread their fraudulent propaganda to the Arab people. Through German and Italian universities, they send invitations to Arab students, inviting them to free holiday trips to fascist countries. Several newspapers published by the Italian Fascist Youth University often carry articles speaking to the Arab youth, and some are even published in Arabic. Arab students entering German and Italian universities can get special discounts, and even General Franco sends invitations to Arab students to visit the Spanish rebels.

In India, many university professors promote National Socialist propaganda, and newspapers often have essays praising the merits of German universities. Indian students who go to German and Italian universities to visit or study, like Arab students, can get special convenience and discounts. Since the National Socialist Party annexed Austria, the plan to establish an "Indian College" in Vienna was completed at the beginning of this year. The German Institute of Studies in Munich has set up several scholarships, calling on Indian students in German universities to participate in essay competitions with the topic: "The Origin of the Swastika in the Aryan Race and Its Common Usage in India and Germany." Japanese warlords also conduct similar propaganda work through the Asia Bureau. They contact the youth and students of Siam, Annam, Burma, India, and the Malay Archipelago, offer them study conveniences, praise their nationalist enthusiasm, and promise to do their best to assist their national struggles.

Fascism has long wanted to gain power among overseas students in the colonies. Several years ago, the organization of the Indian Overseas Students Association was influenced by Rome and Berlin. This association (which has now stopped) held its first meeting in Rome and its second in Berlin. Recently, when Arab students in Europe advocated holding a meeting to discuss the common problems of Arab countries, Germany tried its best to attract them to a meeting in Berlin. Japanese warlords are using various means to gain power among Malay Archipelago students in Japan.

(II) The Current State of Youth Movements in ××

However, despite this intense work and propaganda, despite thousands of pounds of fascist propaganda funds, despite cheap travel, special educational conveniences, the dispatch of delegations, the buying of newspapers, and intense fraud, the youth and students in the colonies can generally see through the selfish deception of fascism.

Now let's talk about the youth and student movements in ×× and its territories. The Pan-Arab Youth Congress will soon be held in Damascus. This conference will unite all Arab youth in the struggle to eradicate poverty and ignorance, and to defend national culture and democratic freedom. The All-India Students' Conference, in the two years since its establishment, has united students across the country on the basis of defending national culture and academic freedom. They have also participated in the national movement to fight for the welfare and freedom of the ×× people. In the Malay Archipelago and Burma, important youth movements are also growing. The opinions of all these youth movements - freedom and democracy, racial equality, sincere cooperation, the eradication of ignorance and illiteracy, opposition to aggression, and solidarity with the youth and people of the invaded countries - are all opposed to the aggression, racism, persecution of minorities, and so on advocated by fascism.

The youth in ×× know how the youth suffer in places where fascism prevails. They know that students in Manchuria and Korea have been deprived of the freedom of assembly and association. They know that the national education in these places has been completely destroyed. They know the persecution suffered by the youth of Libya and Tripoli, and the massacre suffered by the youth of Abyssinia. Therefore, they cannot believe the fraudulent promises of fascism.

Under the leadership of the ×× National Congress, the All ×× Students' Congress constantly condemns the aggressive policies of fascism. The youth and students of ×× have launched a broad movement to aid China and Spain: they donate money and sponsor the dispatch of medical teams to China. Students go to the countryside to promote boycotts of Japanese goods. In student publications, they express great warmth for the struggle of the youth of Spain and the International Brigades.

×× students studying in Europe have rejected the inducements of Berlin and Rome. The League of ×× Students in Britain (now expanded into the League of European ×× Students), established in January 1937, unanimously passed a resolution at its annual meeting held in April 1938.

"Denounce the actions of fascist aggressors and urge students from all countries around the world to unite to resist further aggression by fascist countries."

Malay Archipelago student groups similarly condemn fascist aggression, especially the Japanese imperialist aggression in China. In December 1938, they held their 30th annual meeting in Amsterdam. At this meeting, which was attended by about a thousand people, they explicitly condemned fascism and called on the people of the Malay Archipelago and the Netherlands to cooperate closely in the struggle against Eastern and Western fascism. They also raised money for China at the meeting.

Berlin's current attempt to gain power in the Arab Students' Congress in Europe has failed. Arab students decided to meet in Brussels. They passed a motion.

"Suggest that the Executive Committee contact international student organizations in order to introduce the members of the Islamic world and work together with them for peace, freedom, and culture."

Egyptian parliamentarian and President of the Islamic Youth Association Dr. Abdul Hamie Safd Bey recently issued a declaration saying:

"After trampling on the Arabs of Tripoli. The Italians have decided to turn Cyrenaica and Tripoli into provinces of the Italian Empire. The announcement of the Italian leader styling himself as the protector of Islam is still fresh in our memory." This declaration argues: "Egyptians and Muslims around the world should unite to oppose this fascist policy of eliminating Muslims to turn Tripoli into Italian hands. This is our sacred task."

Mr. Raif Khouri, who represented the youth of Syria and Palestine at the Second World Youth Congress in New York, recently published an article saying:

"The German and Italian fascist countries want to use Arab youth in imperialist wars. Fascism has lured a small number of Arab youth. But in general, Arab youth do not like fascism. They have sufficient reason to hate fascism. Fascism is the oppressor of their compatriots in Tripoli. It drives the Jews out of legitimate families to support Zionism… Finally, fascism is imperialism. Arab youth hate imperialism."

The fact that representatives from India, Arabia, and the Malay Archipelago participated in the World Youth Congress in New York, and that students from these countries all participate in the World Student Association, shows the desire of ×× youth to cooperate with world youth. ×× youth are uniting to protect their culture, to eradicate ignorance and poverty, and to fight for freedom and democracy. They eagerly hope for the assistance of the youth of the mother country, and they eagerly hope to work together with the youth of the mother country, because the youth of ×× and the youth of the mother country must carry out the common struggle to fight for and against fascism. Their united law is the guarantee of victory against fascism. (The End)

### Reflection of Public Opinion in the Philippines: A New Policy of Independence, Democracy, and Peace

— Continued from the second edition of this newspaper: Written by G. Capadocfa (Philippines)

Under no circumstances should the national army be used to suppress workers, farmers, and the people who are struggling to improve their lives. It should not hinder democratic freedom, nor should it interfere with labor organizations and strikes, or the people's rights to assembly and association, because the people do not trust a government that uses force to oppress itself. Therefore, our national defense force should be the people's army, and the education of the army should ensure that soldiers have the spirit to defend the country and democracy and can genuinely cooperate with the people. The Philippine Communist Party believes that a good army should be truly close to the people, so it suggests popular education, freedom of belief, and granting soldiers political rights.

The Philippine Communist Party opposes forced belief, as it is practiced among the Christian people of the Philippines. Such forced belief by the military only divides the people of the Philippine Islands and gives Japan or other aggressors the opportunity to interfere. We suggest that the Moro people be given equal rights, equal parliamentary representation, non-interference in their beliefs and cultural traditions, as well as freedom and the right to self-determination, and practical assistance to raise their economic level. If we do not guarantee these rights to the Moro people, they will continue to disrupt and hate the Philippine people, and be incited by reactionary fascists to secede from us, because reactionary fascists are intensifying their propaganda to them using the slogan of "liberation".

V. Democratic Front

The Philippine Communist Party is fighting for national independence and ultimately building a socialist society. We believe that the problems of the Philippine people cannot be completely solved unless in a free and democratic republic and the highest form of a democratic country - a socialist country. Look at the Soviet Union in a socialist society; the lives of the masses are improving day by day, there are no unemployed people, and land and industry are completely in the hands of the people. The new Stalin Constitution has been promulgated as the basic law governing the people's labor and rest, granting the Soviet people the most comprehensive democratic rights that mankind has never had.

We understand that the Philippines has not yet developed to the point where it can immediately build a socialist society, so this goal has not yet been endorsed by the majority of the people. We also understand that there are many different opinions even on the issue of independence, but at the same time, we also understand that the main problems at present are improving the working and living conditions of the people, defending and developing democratic freedom, and defending the autonomous republic from the ravages of war. The Philippine Communist Party wants to do everything possible to accomplish these tasks, first of all, it is necessary to unite the Philippine people based on democracy and common happiness. Therefore, we are willing to cooperate with all parties, political groups, workers and farmers, and friendly organizations. No matter how different our ultimate goals are, our common task at present is to establish a democratic front in the Philippines to improve our living conditions, defend and expand our democratic rights, defend peace and security, and promote the early realization of independence. If we are to accomplish these tasks, we need to unite. Dividing the Philippine people's need and desire for unity is betraying democracy and national independence in the Philippines.

We urge the political parties and organizations of the Philippine People's Front, the progressive and democratic individuals in the Nationalist Party, workers' and farmers' organizations, and youth and women's organizations to cooperate with us to establish the Philippine People's Democratic National Unity - the Democratic Front. We are willing to cooperate with President Quezon to organize the masses and complete democratic politics and legislative procedures on the road of democracy. We sincerely want to eliminate all past prejudices in the face of national crisis and make the Philippine people's great unity possible. On the basis of the Democratic Front, we foresee that in the near future, the Philippine people will be able to unite to support the government in resolutely implementing the program desired by the Philippine people.

March towards the Democratic Front of the Philippine People! Defend peace and democracy, oppose fascism and war! The Philippine nation will closely cooperate for democracy, peace, and security! Establish a free and democratic Philippines!

Editorial

### Reporter Oath Movement

Newspaper reporters are not only the voice and eyes of the people, but also the educators and close knitters of the people. This is true in foreign countries, and especially true in China, where education is not widespread and the cultural level of the people is relatively low. This is true in peacetime, and especially true in China, which is fighting for the survival and freedom of the entire nation.

However, when we review the work achievements of Chinese journalists in the twenty-two months since the start of the war of resistance, in the country, in the war zone, and in the enemy's rear, we do have many journalists who, in the guise of warriors, convey the suffering and opinions of the people, and at the same time strive to organize the people and educate the people. However, when we look around and ask ourselves, how many people can truly be worthy of the natural calling of "organizing the people" and "educating the people"? Are there not still a few people who still regard the central government's decrees and the leader's instructions as central, and ignore the responsibility of journalists in the war of resistance and national reconstruction? Are there not still a few scoundrels who brazenly accept the bribes of the enemy, traitors, and rebels, and shamelessly spread poisonous propaganda that betrays the country and deceives the people, such as "anti-communism, anti-Chiang, peace talks"? Are they not still carrying out traitorous espionage and terrorist acts (such as those recently carried out by the Wang clique in the Shanghai concession) to destroy China with the financial support of the enemy and traitors? We cannot be complacent because we ourselves are clean! Because the actions of these traitors, scoundrels, and collaborators in the journalistic community not only betray the central government, betray the motherland, betray all the people, but also greatly insult the personality of all of us journalists! Today, we must first wash away this insult, and we must regard the elimination of these scoundrels, traitors, and collaborators in the journalistic community as an important task.

The Hong Kong branch of the Chinese Youth Journalists Association has launched a signature oath movement for Hong Kong journalists in order to support the General Mobilization Program for National Spirit and its implementation measures. It seeks the participation of various newspaper offices, news agencies, and reporters stationed in Hong Kong. More than 150 people have already agreed to this move, and more will continue to join in the future. The association decided to hold the oath ceremony at Kong Saint Hall at 4:00 pm today (May 5). This is a glorious initiative by Hong Kong journalists, a spiritual declaration of war and an active demonstration by all patriotic, nationalistic, and honorable journalists against a small number of scoundrels, traitors, and collaborators. In particular, in the oath, in addition to the full text of the National Covenant, four items that journalists must abide by are added: (1) Do not publish articles by the pro-peace faction, (2) Do not publish advertisements for traitors, (3) Do not sell traitor newspapers, (4) Do not print traitor publications. This is the first time that Hong Kong journalists have expressed their support for the central government's policy of resisting Japan and opposing the pro-peace movement of traitors in an open and upright manner. This is the first time that Hong Kong journalists have taken heroic and resolute action to enhance the status of journalists and the authority of public opinion. This is also the first time that Hong Kong journalists have shown the power of a united front to earnestly fulfill the natural calling of journalists during the war of resistance and national reconstruction.

We sincerely support and participate in this sacred oath movement of journalists with infinite enthusiasm. However, we would also like to say a few words to our colleagues and compatriots from all walks of life:

First, there are definitely more than the 150 or 60 people who took the oath today who are patriotic, nationalistic, and love the people among Hong Kong journalists. We hope that everyone will hurry up and participate today. Those who are not fully prepared and cannot participate in the first oath are also expected to prepare quickly for the second oath. The Hong Kong Chinese Journalists Association replied that "it has already made a decision on this matter" when the Journalists Association went to discuss co-sponsoring it, which is the best thing. We are looking forward to an even larger and more serious and enthusiastic oath ceremony with more participants. Moreover, the four special articles for journalists must also be added to the covenant, especially the oath should be expanded from journalists to all news practitioners.

Second, the oath is the beginning of our efforts to support the central government's national reconstruction policy and strive for national liberation with a fighting spirit and practical work. We not only hope that every journalist will be strict with themselves and earnestly implement it after taking the oath, but also review each other, encourage each other, and expand the scope to earnestly fulfill the responsibilities of journalists in educating the people and organizing the people at any time and any place. The Youth Journalists Association already has regular group meetings, symposiums, lectures, etc. We hope that the association will redouble its efforts to improve in the future, and we hope that everyone will actively participate at any time. Only by participating in collective life can we improve our knowledge and cultivation, and only by participating in collective life can we guarantee the progress of our actual work.

Third, we know that journalists and newspapers are the power to educate the people and organize the people, but the broad masses of the people are also the power to educate journalists and newspapers, and promote their progress and hard work. Therefore, we hope that people from all walks of life, especially social leaders, will unanimously support the journalists who take the oath today, urge and encourage them from time to time, and pay close attention to and severely punish all newspapers that serve the enemy and traitors, as well as those scoundrels in the journalistic community who serve the enemy and traitors. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said, "The General Mobilization of National Spirit and the National Covenant are the greatest weapons of the war of resistance, and the organization of our National Monthly Meeting is the spiritual fortress of our people in the war of resistance." We must use the power of the group to consolidate this fortress, and we must work together to use this greatest weapon to completely eliminate the enemy and traitors and strive for the victory and success of the war of resistance and national reconstruction.

### Enemy Troops in Central Hubei Reinforce the Westward Offensive Zhongxiang Attempt to Cross the Xiang River in Vain Enemy Increases Troops in Northern Henan We are Closely Monitoring

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing by This Newspaper on the 4th] The enemy has been continuously reinforcing troops in central Hubei for days, attempting a fierce offensive westward. More than 400 enemy troops between Zhongbu Ferry and Shizikou near Zhongxiang used machine guns to fire fiercely at us early on the 3rd, covering more than a dozen motorboats and wooden boats to forcibly cross the Xiang River. They were repelled by our forces. Fierce fighting between our troops and the enemy continues near the suburbs of Nanchang. No changes in Gao'an and Wuning.

[Special Morning Dispatch from Chongqing by This Newspaper on the 4th] Eastern Henan has become quieter, but the enemy is still increasing troops towards Xinxiang and Kaifeng, showing intentions. We are strictly defending.

Enemy Forces in Hainan Stalled [Dispatch from Xuwen by the Central News Agency on the 3rd] Our army has launched a guerrilla war on Hainan Island. The enemy is unable to advance and has suffered heavy casualties. Changpo City in Qiongdong County and Fuba Flower Farm in Lingao County have been successively recovered by our forces, killing more than 30 enemy officers and soldiers. The enemy who landed at Bo'ao Port was ambushed by our forces in the Jiaji City area. All important strongholds in that area have been captured by our forces. The enemy is stubbornly resisting, but has no ability to advance further.

[Dispatch from Wengyuan by the Central News Agency on the 3rd] At 8:45 a.m. on the 3rd, eight enemy aircraft flew to Yu Ziwan, Guitian Village, Tianxi Township, Baisha County, Yingde County, and dropped more than 30 bombs, destroying more than 20 civilian houses and killing and injuring several villagers.

Tightening Along the Coastal Areas of Zhejiang and Guangdong [Dispatch from Shanghai by the Associated Press on the 4th] According to reports received here from the Chinese side, after continuous fierce bombing of Ningbo, the Japanese have now concentrated 18 warships in Hangzhou Bay and shelled Zhenhai Fort. The Chinese garrison also returned fire, so the situation in eastern Zhejiang is becoming more urgent. Chinese reinforcements are rushing to reinforce important strongholds to prevent the Japanese army from landing. Some highways and bridges have also been destroyed by the Chinese side.

[Dispatch from Shantou by Reuters on the 4th] Eight Japanese seaplanes attacked Shantou this morning, dropping many bombs near Wuqiao Bridge, killing and injuring many people.

In addition, Admiral Nobel, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, arrived here today on the British ship "Falmouth."

[Dispatch from You Tou by Reuters on the 4th] Multiple Japanese aircraft continued to bomb Shantou today, killing and injuring many people, and strafed areas near the coast with machine guns.

Recapturing Famous Cities in Jiangnan [Dispatch from Guangde by the Central News Agency on the 3rd] This morning, we recaptured Lishui, Yixing, and Baoyuan Honglanbu, which is a major victory marking a new phase in the eastern theater. Lishui is a barrier to Nanjing, and Yixing is an important stronghold on the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway. It has been 18 months since it fell to the enemy. We have launched several counterattacks, but all have failed. This time, we recaptured two famous cities in a few hours, indicating that the enemy army has no combat capability. The situation in Jiangnan is about to undergo a major development.

[Dispatch from Guangde by the Central News Agency on the 3rd] Our mobile unit attacked the enemy troops under Lishui on the night of the 2nd, taking advantage of the bright moon and gentle breeze. The enemy woke up from their dreams and desperately resisted, engaging in hand-to-hand combat for five hours. The enemy could not withstand it and fled to the north of the city. We recaptured Lishui at 4:00 a.m. on the 3rd and surrounded Honglanbu in the flush of victory. We captured countless spoils of war in this battle and are currently taking inventory.

### Fierce Fighting Along the Tongpu Railway Enemy in Western Suiyuan Repelled by Our Forces

[Dispatch from Tuanji by the Central News Agency on the 3rd] More than 400 enemy troops from Jishan, with five cannons, invaded the Beidong Village Mabigu Pass area. They were ambushed by us near Beidong, and a part of our forces attacked the enemy's left flank. After several hours of fierce fighting, the enemy could not withstand it and fled south. In this battle, more than 70 enemy troops were killed, and we suffered more than 10 casualties below the platoon leader level.

[Dispatch from Xingji by the Central News Agency on the 3rd] Since mid-last month, we have repeatedly destroyed the section of the Tongpu Railway south of Hanxinling and north of Linfen, demolishing more than 70 li of tracks and blowing up many bridges, culverts, and dangerous roadbeds. On the 27th and 28th, we also blew up the Chaizhuang Iron Bridge south of Linfen and thoroughly destroyed the tracks near Gaoxian Station (northwest of Quwo). We also intercepted and overturned a northbound train near Zhangjiazhuang between Dongguo and Wenxi. As a result, the southern section of the Tongpu Railway was cut off everywhere by us. According to a happy family conversation by a certain military officer, the southern section of Tongpu will probably not be able to transport troops within two months.

[Dispatch from Xingji by the Central News Agency on the 3rd] Starting on the 24th of last month, our troops on the periphery of Fushan launched another fierce attack, one route heading straight for Chengguan, one route attacking Tianfengli (east of the city), and one route advancing into Guanque and the North and South Han Villages (northwest of Fushan), cutting off the communication line to Linfen in the west. Fierce fighting continued overnight. By dawn, the enemy in the northeast corner and northwest of the city was also gradually unable to withstand it. They repeatedly used large amounts of poison gas to prevent our advance. As of the evening of the 25th, the enemy and us were still fighting.

[Dispatch from Xingji by the Central News Agency on the 3rd] At dawn on the first day, our army attacked Nanggou Valley west of Qiao'ershang near Heilongguan. More than 100 defending enemy troops stubbornly resisted. By noon, another part of our forces ambushed from Qikongyao in the north. The enemy retreated to Qiao'ershang, killing more than 30 enemy troops.

[Dispatch from Xingji by the Central News Agency on the 3rd] Since the latter half of last month, the highway communication line of the enemy within the Suiyuan border has been subjected to large-scale destruction by our self-defense army in coordination with the vast masses of the people. Near Bikqi, 10 kilometers east of PingSui Road, 7 hua of road was destroyed and more than 50 telephone poles were uprooted. Near Duo'erxie (17 li west of Chasuchi), 2 hua of railway was destroyed and 60 telephone poles were destroyed. Near She (east of Baotou), 6 hua of road was destroyed and 40 telephone poles were destroyed. East of Maiyuanzhao (west of Taosihou), 4500 meters of railway was destroyed, and one bridge and one car shed were destroyed. About 500 kilograms of electric wire were recovered. At Fangxiaying (east of Guisui), 2 yi of railway was destroyed, one small bridge was burned, and 3 hua of electric wire were burned. Several kilometers of the Wugongling area on the Guiwu Highway were destroyed and about 5 li of electric wire were destroyed. The enemy who attacked Wutie (25 kilometers northeast of Wuyuan) on the 22nd of last month was fiercely attacked by us. In the evening, they fled eastward. When we followed and pursued, the enemy released a large amount of poison gas to cover up their two-pronged attack. One route was from Heitanggou (5 kilometers northwest of Bikqi), and one route was from Zhuquangou (5 kilometers northeast of Chasu Pass). Our army fiercely counterattacked and resolutely failed to return. Our army is still pursuing.

### Japanese Side Asks Various Countries to Reorganize the Shanghai Municipal Council and Attempts to Falsify the Land Regulations British Spokesperson Refuses with Euphemisms

[Dispatch from Tokyo by Reuters on the 4th] Zetian, an official from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, submitted a suggestion yesterday to the British and American ambassadors, advocating the thorough reorganization of the administrative organization of the Shanghai International Settlement. Zetian strongly criticized the election system of the Municipal Council, believing that it violated democratic principles, saying that all important powers were monopolized by the British side, forming an oligarchy. Zetian also said that the most important "Land Regulations" must be changed to adapt to the new environment, and the Municipal Council must be reorganized to ensure that it can truly represent all relevant countries, especially the representatives of Japan, which must be increased. The ambassadors of the United Kingdom and the United States have now conveyed Zetian's views to their respective governments.

[Dispatch from London by the Associated Press on the 4th] After Japan requested the reorganization of the administrative institutions of the Shanghai Concession, a British spokesperson reiterated yesterday that the current administrative institutions are extremely fair. The spokesperson believed that the Japanese investment in Shanghai has increased, but the ratio of five British members and two Japanese members on the Municipal Council is very fair. He also strongly stated that changes to the Land Regulations must be agreed to by the Chinese government, which will definitely not agree. The spokesperson also specifically pointed out that the land tax paid by the British in Shanghai and the rent paid by the Chinese are almost double the amount paid by the Japanese. He also stated that the Shanghai puppet government's simultaneous request to change the land tax cannot affect the legal status of the Land Regulations of the Concession.

Setting Off Firecrackers to Scare Enemy Soldiers [Dispatch from Shanghai by the Associated Press on the 4th] Yesterday, the telephones of various newspaper offices, news agencies, and patrol houses in the city rang continuously, saying that Chinese army guerrillas were attacking the suburbs, and the Japanese army was extremely busy north of the Suzhou River. It was learned that it was all a rumor. It was caused by the Chinese people setting off firecrackers in large numbers to celebrate the lunar eclipse. The police tried their best to stop residents from setting off firecrackers, but it was not effective immediately. However, the police were very suspicious of where the Chinese people got such a large number of firecrackers, because setting off firecrackers is prohibited by the authorities.

Flag Hanging Problem Attitude of the Concession [Dispatch from Chongqing by the Central News Agency on the 2nd] A certain official of the Public Concession Municipal Council in Shanghai recently told a reporter from the Zi Lin Western News that the Municipal Council has no right to interfere with the county flag issue, and even if the Concession authorities have the legal power to prohibit flag hanging, they are unwilling to cause terrorist incidents and disrupt the order and security within the Concession. However, the Municipal Council authorities will absolutely not allow the Chinese to hang flags for movements with political implications, so they have decided to contact influential Chinese leaders to advise residents not to hang flags outside the prescribed eighth day.

### British House of Commons Discusses the Far East Issue Conservative Party Members Ask Questions One After Another Expressing Attention to Japan's Anti-British Sentiment

[Dispatch from London by Reuters on the 3rd] Conservative Party member Wilson asked in the House of Commons today whether the Chinese government is building a railway directly to the border between China and Myanmar, and whether the Myanmar side has obtained the consent of the Myanmar Parliament before implementing the construction of a railway to connect with the Chinese railway. Colonel Moore Handah said that he had received a report that the Chinese government did indeed want to build a railway from Kunming directly to the border between Myanmar and Yunnan and had started preliminary work.

Dredging the Huangpu River [Dispatch from London by Reuters on the 3rd] In the British House of Commons today, someone asked whether the Japanese authorities have now allowed the Shanghai Dredging Bureau to engage in dredging the Huangpu River. Foreign Minister Butler replied no. He also said that he is currently actively negotiating this matter with the Japanese authorities in Shanghai and hopes to resolve it soon. Subsequently, Conservative Party members Howard and Mina asked that, given that these negotiations are taking a long time and the Dredging Bureau is of great importance to international shipping, could the Foreign Minister negotiate further?

Foreign Minister Butler immediately replied on behalf of Chamberlain that the matter was as described. However, judging from a similar incident that occurred at approximately the same time, the Japanese side allowed the British to go on that occasion.

Tianjin Concession Conservative Party member Hantier asked whether Prime Minister Chamberlain had negotiated with the Japanese side to remove the defensive obstacles around the British Concession in Tianjin, and to what extent had the Prime Minister negotiated to restore order there to peacetime. Foreign Minister Butler replied that the situation there has not changed at present and is still as described on April 3. However, the government will try its best to find a way to restore the peacetime state as soon as possible.

The central district was located in the Military Affairs Commission Square, where torches from all sub-districts were ignited from this district. At the center of the central district venue was a glass fire tower, divided into three layers. The lower layer was octagonal, inscribed with the eight virtues: Loyalty, Filial Piety, Benevolence, Love, Faithfulness, Righteousness, Harmony, and Peace. The middle layer was quadrilateral, inscribed with the four virtues: Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Shame. The upper layer was triangular, inscribed with "Nation Above All, People Above All," "Military First, Victory First," and "Concentrated Will, Concentrated Strength." Participants in the ceremony included over a hundred people on the main platform, including Chairman Chiang, President Kong, President Gan, President Dai, Secretary-General Zhang, Madame Chiang, Wang Chongxi, and Chen Shaokuan, as well as over five hundred foreign guests and visitors, all wearing "Guest Passes," seated on a specially constructed high platform on the left, with an air of composure and elegance, as if watching a "Christmas" celebration. On the central field were over three thousand representatives from the Party, government, military, agriculture, industry, commerce, youth, and women, divided into eight teams, standing in the formation of the National Games emblem, arching around the fire platform in the center of the field. A blazing fire burned on the platform, with flames stretching out over ten feet long, creating an extremely enthusiastic and uplifting atmosphere. After the ceremony began, Chairman Chiang presided over the ritual, and observed three minutes of silence for the fallen soldiers and deceased compatriots. Then, Chairman Chiang delivered a speech via broadcast, stating, "Compatriots across the country, in order to promote the National Spiritual Mobilization, I, the Chairman, have specially organized this pilgrimage of fire during the commencement of the National Monthly Meeting today. This fire represents our spirit, symbolizing the burgeoning revival spirit of the entire Chinese nation, soaring into the sky and illuminating the universe. I hope that everyone can spread this spirit to all parts of the country, and promote and expand it infinitely. Now, let the fire be lit."

After the speech, twenty-seven men and women in white shirts and pants, holding torches, took fire from the fire tower and ran to the other eight districts. They were messengers of the fire, representing the transmission of the central will to the people. Chairman Chiang said in Wuhan that the Chinese people in the future must "receive the baptism of fire," and that everyone should have a bright mind and fiery behavior. Therefore, the National Spiritual Mobilization uses fire as a symbol.

Huang Renlin further reported that the total amount of contributions was 2,291,530.33 yuan, and due to being deposited in the bank, there was interest of 11,090.14 yuan, so the total contribution was 2,302,604.47 yuan.

At 8:00 PM, Chairman Chiang led the nation in swearing the National Covenant, and broadcast a speech, with everyone listening respectfully. After the speech, the military band led the singing of the Leader's Song, followed by the Pilgrimage of Fire. Participating teams all took fire from the fire tower in turn, parading the fire source, and singing the Oath Song, the Common Goal Song, and the Fight to the End Song. The songs were melodious and resonated throughout the sky, greatly uplifting the spirit of the entire audience. After the ceremony, a torch parade was held, led by Battalion Commander Yuan, passing through the commercial center, Central Park, the First Model Market, Chaotianmen, Fuzi Pond, and the parade grounds. At each location, participants joined the parade in sequence, shouting slogans and singing songs such as the Leader's Song. The parade did not disperse until 11:00 PM.

### Model Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Base – The Current Situation in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region

— Lin Huanping

[Ming Ge Agency Comprehensive Dispatch] In a small cave dwelling, on a one-丈 long pit, were spread the bedding of five or six people. They lived in such cramped conditions. Comrade Liu ××, member of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Administrative Committee and Director of the Education Department, was sitting on a rough black felt, along with the reporter and three comrades working on a low table beside the felt. We all wore cloth shoes and sat on the felt. This was the custom of northerners. As a result, the felt was splattered with piles of mud. After I explained the purpose of my visit to Comrade Liu and presented seven questions for his instruction, he looked at me with his sharp eyes and smiled:

"Comrade Lin! I am very grateful that you have come to our side, despite the hardship, to report everything here to our compatriots across the country. I am very willing to tell you in detail."

He smiled again, and his face, tanned by the sun and roughened by the wind and sand, combined with his large, thick glasses, fully displayed his fighter's stance, originating from the intellectual class.

"Let me answer your questions one by one," he added, and began his talk:

1. The Growth Process of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region

"The year before last, at the end of 1937, the comrades who remained in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region's rear area to carry out anti-× work, being out of contact with the provincial government, deeply felt the necessity of restoring political power, and actively made preparations for this. The preparations were completed in a short period of time, and a representative assembly was held on January 15 last year. After the assembly, a telegram was sent to the central government, which approved the establishment of the Border Region Administrative Committee. By the end of February, work was actively underway. The × people were very afraid of our development, and in March they began to encircle and attack us. But our heroic soldiers and civilians quickly crushed the × people's encirclement. By April, the work was progressing very smoothly. In October, we were again subjected to a ten-pronged encirclement by the × people. At that time, we implemented a scorched earth policy, withdrawing from the county towns to the villages, and counter-encircling the × people, not attacking large groups of × people, but specifically attacking the × people's supplies, forcing them to use airplanes to deliver meals. At this time, we judged that they would inevitably collapse. At that time, we attacked the × people's headquarters, killing several of their officers. The × people were even more panicked. Soon, they collapsed one after another. We intercepted the × people into several sections, giving them a fatal blow, annihilating more than 7,000 × people. One solid regimental commander and two detachment commanders were also killed by us. The loss of × people's officers was unexpectedly large. Our losses were only one-fifth of the × people's. We successfully crushed the × people's ten-pronged encirclement. The Border Region government became even stronger. Now we govern a total of seventy-four counties, fifty-four in Hebei, sixteen in Shanxi, and four in Chahar.

2. Politics

"Every time we are besieged by the × people, we feel that democracy is not enough in politics. If we want to thoroughly defeat the × people, only thorough democracy will do. The politics here is being advanced in this belief, following these lessons learned from experience. The political organizational system is village chief - district office - government - commissioner's office - border region government. The organization of the border region government is the Administrative Committee, with nine members: Song ××, Hu ××, Nie ××, Liu ××, Sun ××, Lü ××, Zhang ×, Lou ××, Li ××. Song is the Chairman, Hu is the Vice Chairman. Under it are the Civil Affairs Department, Finance Department, Industry Department, Education Department, and Secretariat. Hu concurrently serves as the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Song as the Director of the Finance Department, Zhang concurrently serves as the Director of the Industry Department, Liu as the Director of the Education Department, and Lou concurrently serves as the Secretary-General. In addition, there are the Living Technology Committee, the Work Experiment Zone, the Editorial and Review Committee, the Economic Committee, and the Inspection Committee. Village chiefs and district chiefs are all elected by the people, and some county chiefs are also elected by the people. There are even female village chiefs and female district chiefs. They are all very young, enthusiastic, and spirited. This is a progressive phenomenon produced by the War of Resistance. It is also a phenomenon rarely seen in other war zones besides our ×th war zone. We recently also plan to have all county chiefs elected by the people.

3. Military Affairs

"We have ××0,000 troops. All are commanded by Comrade ××, Commander of the Border Region. There are district commanders in the four administrative commissioner districts. We have our own arsenals, where hand grenades and other weapons can be manufactured. Many puppet soldiers have defected and joined our ranks. To date, there are almost 30,000 people. Our requirement for puppet soldiers to defect is this: first, we send people to the puppet army officers to explain the great righteousness that Chinese people should not kill their own compatriots, and ask them to express their attitude. If they express themselves well, we will directly carry out defection work with them; if they do not perform well, we will disintegrate their subordinates and eventually destroy them.

"The × people's butcher knives have taught the common people too well. Their national hatred and personal hatred have been unified. They are all willing to join the army. Parents will never forbid their sons to become soldiers. If the eldest son gloriously sacrifices his life for the country, they are not sad at all. They tragically send the younger son to avenge his brother!

"When the guerrillas destroy railways or highways, the common people will provide the greatest assistance. The × people repair them, and when evening comes, they do not go back. The villagers beat gongs and call on the common people to destroy the railways or highways. Those who are waiting there also join in to do the destruction work together. The × people make them guard the railways and highways, and they help the guerrillas to do the destruction work. After the destruction, they ask the guerrillas to tie their hands behind their backs, indicating that they have lost their freedom, so that when the × people come, they will be helpless.

"Our lovely common people joined the guerrillas and went into the electric lamp factory in Peiping to destroy the machines. But their knowledge level is very low. After they threw all the hand grenades, the engine still stood there intact. A foreign technician came out and asked them in surprise why they didn't destroy the engine? They said, we'll come again next time, and left.

"With such good common people, who says North China belongs to the × people, who says China will perish?

4. People's Movement

"Speaking of the goodness of the common people, we must talk about our people's movement work. The current people's organizations include the Workers' National Salvation Association, the Peasants' National Salvation Association, the Women's National Salvation Association, the Youth National Salvation Association, the Children's Corps, and religious organizations such as Christianity and Buddhism. These are based on occupational boundaries. All civil servants and freelancers participate in the "United Association for National Salvation against the Japanese," which is a purely united front organization with individual members and group members. Various people's organizations are launched from the bottom up and are independent. The funding is also planned by themselves. Those that are difficult and cannot be raised, our border region government also subsidizes them. The border region government never interferes in their activities. The government merely stands in a supporting position, helping them solve difficulties and correcting their mistakes. The connection between the government and the people's organizations is achieved through joint conferences. Under the principle of not violating the interests of the War of Resistance, all speech, publication, assembly, association, and belief are absolutely free. Precisely because we have adopted this very democratic policy, the people's movement work has been able to develop so easily and deeply. Is the enthusiasm and activeness of the common people accidental at all?

5. Economy and Finance

"In order to adjust the finance of the border region, unify the currency system, deal with the financial offensive of the × people to attack the legal tender and the Jin banknote, and combat counterfeit money, we established the Border Region Bank. We used the legal tender and the Jin banknote as reserves, initially 500,000, which can now be increased. We issued 3 million banknotes. The amount of issuance in the border region can actually be 30 million, but we have not issued that much. Our Border Region Bank banknotes have absorbed the legal tender and the Jin banknote scattered among the people. In this way, we shattered the × people's conspiracy to absorb and attack the legal tender and the Jin banknote. The × people used the issuance of counterfeit currency as a means of attacking the legal tender and the Jin banknote, but their issuance has exceeded the saturation point and is depreciating day by day. The × people used political pressure to force its use. The more they do this, the less the people believe in it, and the more it depreciates. Therefore, with the people's faith, and under the enthusiastic support of all foreign businessmen for foreign trade, who only use the legal tender and refuse to use counterfeit money, the power of the legal tender has reached Peiping and Tianjin. The position of the legal tender is becoming more consolidated.

6. Improving the People's Livelihood

"We do not provide passive relief to improve the people's livelihood, but strive for active relief. We opened factories and cloth factories, and exploited coal mines and gold mines, absorbing unemployed workers and farmers to work. We actively persuade the common people to engage in handicraft production. We rectified water conservancy, promoted the production movement, and expanded and increased agricultural products. Generally speaking, even under the × people's blockade and offensive, the people's lives are improving day by day.

7. Culture and Education

"The basic policies on culture and education are: 1. Restore existing schools; 2. Open new schools. Now the number of schools under the jurisdiction of our border region government has increased by one-tenth compared to before the war. There are now more than 7,000 schools and more than 320,000 primary school students; secondary schools are all cadre training schools; and each of the four commissioner districts has a national secondary school; there are cadre schools in the army; all people's organizations have cadre training classes; there is also an agricultural cadre training school; Pinghan Suidong has an Anti-Japanese College, divided into political and military and people's movement departments; currently planned to open are the Mongolian-Tibetan College and the Anti-Japanese National Construction College to be established in the west of the Pinghan Line. In short, we must make the greatest efforts to eliminate illiteracy, so that every common person, regardless of gender, will become a highly knowledgeable fighter for national salvation and construction!"

At this point, Comrade Liu had explained the seven questions raised by the reporter very clearly in one breath. The reporter felt exceptionally satisfied and said goodbye and left.

### Sudden Change of Soviet Foreign Minister – Resignation of Litvinov Approved – Replaced by Molotov Concurrently – Britain and France Greatly Shocked Upon Hearing the News

Litvinov

[Reuters, Moscow, 3rd] Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov voluntarily submitted his resignation, which has been approved, and he will be replaced by People's Committee Chairman Molotov concurrently.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 3rd] Diplomatic and political circles in London are greatly shocked to hear of the resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov. The news has been confirmed by TASS, which stated that Litvinov "has resigned voluntarily," and the vacancy will be filled by People's Committee Chairman Molotov. The reason for the change has not been explained. Since the Bolsheviks came to power in 1917, Litvinov has been the party's unofficial representative in Britain. The most interesting event in his life was a few months later, when he was exchanged for the British representative Lockhart, who was captured by the Bolsheviks, and returned to his country to serve as Foreign Minister for more than 20 years. His wife is Ibero, originally from Britain.

[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 4th] Molotov, who succeeded Litvinov as Soviet People's Foreign Minister, was originally named Skriabin, born in 1890, and joined the Communist Party as a member in 1906. He began his political activities in 1924 and served as a member of the Communist Party's Political Bureau. In 1930, he succeeded Rykov as Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee. It is said that Molotov has no deep understanding of foreign affairs.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 4th] British political circles believe that Litvinov's resignation as Soviet Foreign Minister is a great blow to Britain. The News Chronicle reported that Molotov will organize negotiations with Britain, but it is generally expected that the Soviet Union is currently attempting to completely isolate itself from European politics and may adhere to absolute neutrality. It is also said that the reason for Litvinov's resignation was a difference of opinion, as the British government refused to extend the guarantee to the Far East, fearing that it would provoke Japan to join the anti-communist countries with a military alliance.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 3rd] The news of Litvinov's sudden resignation came like a thunderbolt to this question, and the British Foreign Office was particularly shocked. Sources here said that Litvinov's resignation had nothing to do with Britain's reply to the Soviet Union's proposal, as the reply had already been drafted and passed by the cabinet on Wednesday, but had not yet been delivered to Moscow. Litvinov's resignation was entirely decided by Moscow, as the Soviet Embassy in London had not been informed of it beforehand. When reporters first went to the Soviet Embassy to inquire, the first secretary of the embassy denied it and said that if it was true, then Danjin would succeed him. After waiting for a long time, the Soviet Embassy officially confirmed that Litvinov had resigned, and that Molotov would succeed him. Political and diplomatic circles here have not yet been able to determine the reason for this change of Soviet diplomatic personnel, believing that Molotov has no political achievements and lacks special experience in European affairs. People close to official circles believe that there may be a drastic change in Soviet foreign policy.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 3rd] The news of Litvinov's resignation and Molotov's succession caused quite a shock in France. Political circles believe that there are two possible reasons for this change: one is dissatisfaction with Litvinov's Western European policy, and the other is that negotiations with Western European countries are progressing too slowly.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 4th] According to people close to the French Foreign Ministry, the reason for Litvinov's resignation is still unclear. It is also said that Litvinov's resignation may delay British-Soviet negotiations. It is also said that the new Foreign Minister Molotov has no diplomatic experience and will only follow Stalin's orders in the future.

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 4th] Newspapers here this morning commented on the sudden resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, saying that the reason for his resignation was the complete failure of the Geneva policy. According to the semi-official "Polish Gazette," Litvinov's resignation was due to a conflict of opinions among political leaders. At the same time, Litvinov was criticized for being incompetent in negotiating with Britain. It is also said that Litvinov's ideas have always been opposed by the military. The "Polish Express" said that Molotov was strongly supported by Moscow's top circles. However, London was very surprised that Molotov was appointed to this position.

### Germany Retaliates Against Britain – Expels Six British Nationals – Belgium Expels One German Reporter

[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd] Six British nationals in Germany have received instructions from the German government to leave the country immediately. This is a direct retaliation by the German authorities for Britain's expulsion of six German nationals. The British Embassy in Germany has notified them that they must leave Germany on the 24th of this month. The six British nationals are Mr. Green, the chief correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph," as well as a businessman, an engineer, a language teacher, and two company managers. It is obvious that if Britain expels German nationals again in the future, the German government will immediately retaliate. German government officials told the British Embassy that Green's expulsion was not due to any criticism of his reporting work or the newspaper's policy, but because the London correspondent of the German National News was expelled by the British authorities, so this was a retaliation.

[Reuters, Beijing, 3rd] The Belgian government has ordered the expulsion of one German reporter, who is the leader of several German organizations in Belgium.

### Britain Decides to Reply to Soviet Proposal – Advocates Signing Non-Aggression Pact – Currently Exchanging Views with France – United States Will Aid Britain and France in Resisting Aggression

[Associated Press, London, 3rd] The British government is currently negotiating with the Soviet Union on a joint anti-aggression pact, and is studying a detailed report on the Soviet Union's military strength to prove the strength of the Soviet Union and to silence those who oppose the Soviet Union. It is also trying to persuade countries such as Poland and Romania to recognize the necessity of the Soviet Union's military support in the anti-aggression front. Today, the British Cabinet has decided to submit a reply to Moscow. After France agrees, the Soviet Union can join the non-aggression pact. It is said that the British reply will reserve some military mutual assistance items.

[Reuters, London, 3rd] It is reported that the Cabinet today discussed the situation of the British-Soviet talks, but the British reply to the Soviet proposal has not been sent to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union. It is also reported that Britain and France are currently exchanging views on the negotiations with the Soviet Union.

[Associated Press, London, 3rd] Chamberlain replied to Henderson's question in the House of Commons yesterday, saying that the British government is prepared to consider giving Germany mutual guarantees of non-aggression, and denied that Britain has adopted a policy of encircling Germany. He also said that the British guarantee to Poland does not conflict with the naval agreement. Chamberlain's statement is actually a reply to Germany's reason for abolishing the British-German naval agreement. The British Cabinet has decided to submit a counter-proposal to the Soviet Union after France approves its proposal, hoping that the Soviet Union will join the small aggression agreement.

[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd] According to reliable sources, the German Ambassadors to Britain and France, De Niro, will return to office soon, and may depart tomorrow.

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] According to authoritative sources, President Roosevelt's only response to Hitler's speech is to submit a new "cash and carry" neutrality law to Congress. Once war breaks out, this bill will allow the United States to supply Britain and France with munitions, as Britain and France are both rich and can pay in cash. It is said that President Roosevelt has decided not to refute Hitler's remarks any further.

### Constitution Day in Poland Commemorated with Nationwide Marches and Demonstrations; Hitler Awaits Polish Foreign Minister's Response; Reportedly, Britain Will Allow Poland to Negotiate Freely

[United Press International, Warsaw, May 3] A million Polish soldiers have gathered on the German border, and the entire nation is fervently celebrating Constitution Day with marches and demonstrations, expressing national unity. Demonstrators are shouting, "Long live Poland, Down with the aggressors!" The celebratory mood is especially high in the Polish Corridor, where people are shouting, "We are willing to defend Poland's access to the sea with our blood!"

[United Press International, Berlin, May 3] German-Polish relations have further deteriorated. Today, German newspapers unanimously issued harsh warnings to Poland, urging them not to reject Hitler's demands.

[United Press International, Berlin, May 3] Hitler is currently awaiting the response of Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck to his parliamentary address. The official announcement has been made that Ribbentrop will visit Italy tomorrow. According to some neutral opinions, Ribbentrop's visit to Italy is an emergency one, aimed at explaining Italy's concerns about Germany's policies towards Britain. It is generally believed that the Italian government is quite worried about the increasingly tense German-Polish relations for three reasons: 1. Italy has always been friendly to Poland; 2. If Germany seizes Danzig, its position will become stronger, but this will not benefit Italy at all; 3. Germany's radical actions towards Poland may put Italy at risk of being drawn into a war unrelated to Italy. At the same time, German newspapers continue to coerce Poland. Diplomatic circles believe that Beck's speech tomorrow will still not completely close the door to negotiations with Germany.

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, May 4] A decree issued by the Polish President on April 19 was only announced yesterday and took effect simultaneously. Its content is to extend the military service period for officers who are about to retire with a pension or who have requested leave to resign. Currently, telegraph officers are only re-appointed for two years, and the training period is limited to four weeks, but the current period has been increased to ten weeks. In addition, the age limit for adjutants is 50, staff officers 56, and generals 62 before they can retire.

[United Press International, London, May 4] Regarding Poland's attitude towards Danzig, there is both anxiety and admiration here. British figures believe that Poland has the ability to decide on matters of interest concerning Danzig and the Corridor. It is generally believed that the Polish Foreign Minister is quite calm. Although his speech on Friday will certainly be resolute, it will still be moderate. All newspapers believe that Poland should make a request to turn Danzig into a Polish protectorate.

[Haitong News Agency, London, May 3] According to a diplomatic correspondent for the "Daily Mail," the British government will allow Poland to negotiate freely with Germany without interfering in decisions concerning Poland's vital interests.

### Four Nordic Countries to Hold Diplomatic Talks to Address the Expansion of German Influence

[United Press International, Berlin, May 3] Germany has begun to actively expand its influence in Northern Europe, starting today. The German government has also announced that Sweden and Finland have reached an agreement to prepare for the fortification of the Åland Islands (located in the northern Baltic Sea, between Sweden and Finland).

[United Press International, Berlin, May 3] According to reliable sources, Germany has proposed to Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia the signing of non-aggression treaties. Its obvious purpose is to stabilize the threat from the north, so that it can fully deal with other areas during wartime. According to an official announcement, if Sweden and Finland can strictly maintain neutrality during wartime, Germany will agree to the two countries strengthening the defenses of the Åland Islands. Germany's intention is to prevent the Soviet Union from seizing them as a naval and air base to resist Germany. If Germany completes the non-aggression agreement with the Nordic countries, then Germany can seize them at any time as a base for attacking the Soviet Union. Observers believe that Germany's plan to guarantee the security of the small Nordic countries is to allow German fleets to enter and exit the North Sea freely during wartime without being attacked.

[Reuters, Stockholm, May 3] The foreign ministers of Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland may meet here on May 9 to discuss Germany's recent proposal to conclude non-aggression treaties.

[Reuters, Oslo, May 3] The Norwegian Foreign Minister stated in a parliamentary debate today that Norway and other Nordic countries are now eager to do their best to maintain their right to neutrality. No one can deny us this right. Although the League of Nations cannot help us, it is still the center of justice and peace, and we cannot withdraw from it. Conservative MP Hambro said that Norway must not enter into guarantee treaties with any group.

[United Press International, Helsinki, May 3] The Finnish Foreign Ministry is now beginning to discuss with Sweden proposals for a joint agreement. An official statement will be issued in the coming days.

### Four Soviet Ships Sail to Singapore

[Reuters, Tokyo, May 3] The local "Asahi Shimbun" reported that four Soviet small mine-laying ships left their Black Sea base at the beginning of last month and are heading to Vladivostok. They are expected to arrive in Singapore tomorrow. The ships passed through the Suez Canal on April 11.

### London China Association Holds Annual Banquet; Ambassador Guo Personally Receives Foreign Guests; British Dignitaries Praise Our Country

[Reuters, London, May 3] The China Association's annual banquet was held tonight at the Claridge's Hotel, with more than 200 people attending. Foreign guests included British Minister for Coordination of Defence Lord Chatfield and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Morrison, Lord Gorell, Lord Cecil, Labor MP Snell, Labor MP Swan, Soviet Ambassador Maisky, Sir Milne, Sir Olwen, Mr. Streatfeild, Sir Fraser, Sir Adams, Major General Smallwood, Conservative MP Moreing, Astor, and 50 Chinese dignitaries, including Judge Zheng Tianxi of the Hague Court.

Ambassador Guo Chairs and Delivers a Speech. The chairman was Guo Taiqi, Chinese Ambassador to the UK. Mr. Guo raised a glass to toast all the guests and said, "This spring, we have the right to warmly celebrate the heroic resistance of China's front lines and rear areas. The strong unity of our compatriots and the close relationship between China and Britain have been further strengthened by Britain's recent cooperative actions, which will also benefit both China and Britain. I believe that all of you present will welcome the presence of Ambassador Maisky, whose country not only provides us with good neighborly assistance in this difficult war of resistance, but also serves as a pivotal link between Europe and Asia. We should make East Asia think of Europe and Europe think of East Asia at all times." Mr. Guo then greatly praised the actual sympathy and assistance given to China by Britain, listing the British government's statement on January 14, which clarified the British government's position on the Nine-Power Treaty. This move is an important measure for rebuilding international morality. He also mentioned the assistance in stabilizing the Chinese currency fund, the allocation of funds to relieve Chinese refugees through export credits, the donation of books and instruments by British universities to help China establish new universities in the southwest, and organizations engaged in assisting China's work. Mr. Guo continued, "The British nation's sympathy for China's war of resistance deeply moves me." Ambassador Guo extended a welcome to Lord Chatfield, saying, "Lord Chatfield is dedicated to the cooperation of various departments of British national defense, which is truly admirable. Just as China is now working hard for the cooperation of international joint defense, China is both resisting aggression and striving for construction, which has produced good results. China's contribution to preventing broader acts of aggression and preventing the degeneration of the world has been quickly and deeply understood by Western countries. The entire Chinese nation supports the proposition of its leader, Chairman Chiang, that justice will gain more support. China will always receive the assistance of friendly nations."

British Dignitaries Respond on Behalf of the Guests. Lord Chatfield then responded on behalf of the attending guests, stating the reasons for the close relationship between China and Britain, and using British idioms as examples to prove that China's words and deeds are consistent. Britain is also proud of maintaining the consistency of its words and deeds. "The important promises we have recently made, as evidenced by the events and resolutions of the past few days, show that they are truly valuable. What we admire most about your country is its profound culture and wisdom. I am fascinated by the scenic beauty of your country's paintings. I really do not want to see your country being ravaged by war. We know the arrogance of warmongering, but we also believe that we must make all kinds of preparations, not be negligent in the face of danger, and fight against the threats to our people and ideals. We express our deep sympathy for your country's arduous war of resistance. We admire the spirit of the people of your country who abandon their pens for swords and jointly resist foreign aggression. China will surely overcome these difficulties and gain new experiences and courage from the war of resistance. It is hoped that the disputes in the Far East will soon come to an end, and China's sovereignty will be fully restored, and friendly relations will be rebuilt with its neighbors on an equal footing. Finally, I must mention that under the leadership of its great leader, all the weaknesses of China have been eliminated. That leader not only possesses first-class military knowledge, but also has the best qualities of the nation, winning the unanimous admiration of the world. When the war ends in the future, he will be even more loved by the people of the nation and engage in construction. Since the Xi'an Incident, his selfless and compassionate spirit deeply understands that the greatness of China's future revival is based on China's past history and customs. This quality is truly a product of China. China is like an oak tree, deeply rooted. Although it is eroded by frost and snow in the cold winter, it will eventually sprout new branches and leaves. This may be related to the blowing away of Western trends, but its roots are nurtured by its homeland."

### British House of Lords Passes Motion to Present Address to the King, Expressing Loyalty and Concern

[Reuters, London, May 3] Lord Stanhope proposed in the House of Lords yesterday to present an address to the King before the King sets off for Canada and the United States, expressing the House's overall loyalty to the King and its concern for the King and Queen after their departure. The motion was unanimously passed. Lord Stanhope said that this was the first time in the House's history, and that it was also the first time that the King had personally visited a dominion. Lord Snell also supported the motion, saying, "The King and Queen's trip is of great significance. We want them to know that this trip has gained the love and support of their people." Viscount Elibank said that the people of the country all express a very deep sense of friendship to the people of the United States. The Prime Minister said, "The King's trip will make the connections within the Empire even closer, and the relationship between the people of Britain and the United States is particularly intimate due to their common language, ideals, and customs. This visit by the British head of state to the United States will be warmly welcomed by the people there." Labor leader Attlee said that at this moment, anything that can connect with the major Western democracies is worthy of being done.

[Reuters, London, May 4] The King expressed his gratitude for the "loyalty" address made by the members of Parliament.

Brief Commentary

### Two Topics Today

1. Commemorating Mr. Sun Yat-sen

Today, May 5th, is the 17th anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's inauguration as Extraordinary President.

Seventeen years ago (1921), Mr. Sun Yat-sen assumed the position of Extraordinary President in Guangzhou amidst the pressing internal and external troubles. What is particularly noteworthy is that it re-established the foundation of the revolutionary regime in the South, leading to the thorough reorganization of the Kuomintang from 1923 to 1924, and then to the establishment of the great Three Great Policies (alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communists, and assistance to farmers and workers), which laid the foundation for the Great Chinese Revolution from 1925 to 1927.

Today, as we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen's inauguration as Extraordinary President, in the situation where the revolutionary holy city of Guangzhou has fallen and the national liberation movement of the entire Chinese nation is facing a serious juncture, we must first uphold the spirit of Mr. Sun Yat-sen in establishing a revolutionary regime. On the one hand, we must strive to support the supreme leader and consolidate the Central Government's leadership in the anti-Japanese revolution. On the other hand, we must strive to establish a democratic and revolutionary regime in the war zone and behind the enemy lines, while intensifying the suppression of puppet organizations and traitorous regimes serving the enemy. Second, we must adopt Mr. Sun Yat-sen's decisive spirit of reorganizing the Kuomintang. Eliminate all wavering, corrupt, and stubbornly conservative elements on the anti-Japanese front, and massively absorb young and progressive elements who are determined to resist Japan and have prestige among the masses, enriching and developing the anti-Japanese united front. Third, we must promote and develop Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Great Policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communists, and assistance to farmers and workers, consolidate domestic unity, mobilize the power of the entire nation, and strive for greater international assistance to ensure the smooth progress of the war of resistance and national reconstruction.

2. Strive for Learning and Self-Cultivation

Today, May 5th, is also the 121st anniversary of the birth of Karl Marx, a world-renowned figure, the creator of scientific socialism, the mentor of the working masses' revolution, and a passionate supporter of the liberation movement of oppressed nations.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said, "The books written by Marx and the doctrines he invented can be said to be the culmination of thousands of years of human thought." At the same time, Marx, as early as nearly a hundred years ago, was the most loyal friend of the Chinese national liberation movement. He praised the patriotic and liberation movements of the Chinese people in many of his works, and he repeatedly sang and hoped for the birth of a "free, equal, and fraternal - Republic of China."

In this new and arduous stage of the national liberation movement, not only should every Chinese who does not want to be a slave arm themselves and participate in the cause of resisting Japan and building the nation, but we also especially need to arm our thoughts, doctrines, and intensify all revolutionary self-cultivation. Only by striving for learning and committing to self-cultivation can we overcome new, and perhaps even more difficult, obstacles and achieve final victory. We must use Marx's spirit of learning and the self-cultivation of Marxism to broadly launch the self-study and group study movement of the young masses, and at the same time increase our revolutionary self-cultivation in all practical work. "The task is heavy and the road is long, take it as your own responsibility." May my youth strengthen their theoretical weapons and coordinate with the practice of combat, not only for the war of resistance, but also for the needs of future nation-building.

### Respect to the Shanghai and Chongqing Press Circles!

Under the courageous submission of the Shanghai press circles to the authorities in the concessions, they have encountered new oppression. The "China Morning Post" has been punished with a temporary suspension for opposing the Wang Jingwei faction, and the "Translation and Reporting News" was forced to suspend publication for one day as a protest because it was forbidden to publish Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's May 1st instructions. We extend our most sincere and highest respect to the Shanghai press circles for their heroic maintenance of justice and the spirit of the press circles who bravely struggled after the withdrawal of the National Army from Shanghai, and wish them to achieve a glorious victory.

The Chongqing press circles suffered significant losses during the large-scale attack by Japanese aircraft the day before yesterday. It is said that the "Ta Kung Pao," "Xinhua Daily," "New Sichuan Daily," and "Sichuan Daily" were all bombed. The past struggles of various newspapers have always been valued by the Chinese people and the international community. Recently, they have been praised and reprinted by the opinion circles for supporting the central government's war of resistance and national reconstruction, supporting the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the united front, and opposing the Wang Jingwei faction's "anti-communism and peace". Now, after Wuhan, they have tragically suffered damage from enemy aircraft again. We express our sympathy and respect to our colleagues, and increase our anger and hatred towards the enemy and traitors. We must further clarify the road to liberation and the determination to fight.

In addition to sympathizing with and respecting our colleagues in Shanghai and Chongqing, we must launch a righteous assistance movement in the press circles of friendly countries! Today, the reporters in this port swore an oath, and hope that attention will be paid to it at the same time.

### Litvinov Resigns

Yesterday, all newspapers suddenly reported that Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov had resigned and his resignation had been approved. The vacancy has been concurrently filled by People's Commissar Molotov. This news will surely attract attention from all parties. We believe that Litvinov has contributed to the international peace movement in the past by implementing the Soviet central government's peace policy. This resignation, of course, does not imply any change in Soviet foreign policy, this is one. Secondly, the Soviet political structure is extremely complete, and its policies will never change due to any personnel changes, this is two.

What we need to pay attention to is that the "anti-aggression front" led by Britain has not made adequate progress in cooperating with the Soviet Union, which is not appropriate in the overall situation. However, the Soviet Union has long stated that it has completed all preparations to counter enemy attacks from both the east and west. The Soviet Union does not need any military alliances or any security guarantees. We hope that democratic and peaceful countries can recognize this point, enhance friendship with Britain, and obtain Soviet assistance. In particular, the anti-aggression front must include the Far East to truly guarantee European and even world collective security.

### League of Nations to Meet Mid-Month to Discuss Sino-Japanese Dispute; Foreign Ministers of Britain, France, and Others to Attend

It is reported that the Foreign Ministers of France, the Soviet Union, South Africa, and Poland will also attend. The only issue of the meeting is the Sino-Japanese War, but various dignitaries will take this opportunity to discuss the European political situation.

### The Tranquility of a Million Residents is at Stake; the Landlord and Tenant Ordinance Expires at the End of the Month; the Hong Kong Government is Considering Whether to Extend It; If Extended, Legislation May Need to Be Re-Enacted

Hong Kong is a small island with a dense population. The supply of housing has always been barely sufficient. After the Sino-Japanese War, the population suddenly increased by hundreds of thousands, and the shortage of buildings has become an inevitable result. Therefore, unscrupulous landlords took the opportunity to increase rents, seeking huge profits from refugees and making a fortune from the national crisis, causing social unrest. In June of last year, the Hong Kong authorities promulgated the Landlord and Tenant Ordinance, and residents were able to live in relative peace. However, the validity period of this ordinance is one year, and it will expire at the end of this month. It is particularly noteworthy whether the Hong Kong government will be able to continue to extend its validity in the future. Yesterday, the reporter visited Mr. Lo Man-kam, the Chinese representative, to inquire about everything. According to him, "Regarding the Landlord and Tenant Ordinance, I learned this morning (yesterday) after reading the Western newspapers whether the Legislative Council will discuss it next week. I have not yet received a report, and the authorities have not officially expressed their opinions. However, as far as I know, the Hong Kong government has been studying the Landlord and Tenant Ordinance for a month and will re-enact new legislation or continue the old one, which depends on the results of the research. On the government's side, the first principle is to obtain fair legislation to seek social security. The current protection regulations are not biased, but if new regulations can be updated and are more perfect than the current ones, I have no comments until the results of the research on the new regulations have been obtained. However, there is still one point that all sectors of society cannot ignore. When all parties receive news, there are tenants who increase rents to sub-tenants before the landlord has increased rents, and many of them have made huge profits. Therefore, the rental value of each bed in middle and lower-level houses has increased to more than five yuan. These people are even more vicious than landlords," etc. According to the reporter from the Daily Telegraph yesterday, who interviewed the Colonial Secretary Smith regarding the question of whether to continue the Landlord and Tenant Ordinance, he replied that the matter was under study and had not reached a decision stage. The reporter also interviewed a senior official, who replied that if it is necessary to continue the ordinance, the government may enact new regulations. This matter will be included in the agenda of the Legislative Council meeting next week.

### Hong Kong and Kowloon Students and Youths Solemnly Commemorate the "May Fourth" Movement Yesterday; Schools in Hong Kong Hold Individual Commemorations and Oaths; Schools and Associations in Kowloon Jointly Hold Commemorative Meetings

Tung Chi Middle School in Wan Chai Road held a National Covenant oath and Youth Day celebration meeting in the school auditorium yesterday afternoon. Principal Huo Kuai supervised the oath. More than 300 middle and primary school students participated in the ceremony, and the situation was extremely solemn.

Chinese Staff Burn Bonds

Since its establishment, the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants Association has spared no effort in promoting various patriotic movements. Yesterday, the association held a burning of public bonds to reduce the national burden, as a commemoration of the "May Fourth" movement as the beginning of the patriotic movement of Chinese youth, in order to implement the spirit of mobilization. The meeting opened at 7:00 pm, with more than 200 members attending. After the chairman Xie Jinquan led the ceremony as usual, Yan Renjun, president of Minsheng College, gave a speech on "The May Fourth Movement and its Impact." Then, the burning of bonds was held, including 455 yuan of national salvation public bonds and 75 yuan of Guangdong national defense public bonds. The Kong Huai Sports Association, organized by the drivers of the Phnom Penh Motor Company, also sent 115 yuan of bonds to participate in the burning, and the situation was extremely enthusiastic and tense. After the ceremony, an interesting gathering game was held. The association's request for the closing of members was also announced to be closed, with more than 300 people.

On that day, the Premier resolutely took on the heavy task during a very difficult period, and we should follow the spirit of the Premier to be unafraid of danger and create a more brilliant and bright history of the Chinese nation.

### The Hongliu Anti-Japanese War Theatre Troupe Is Out of Food in Enping; Appeals to All Sectors in Hong Kong for Assistance

Mr. Huang Ninglin, a well-known figure in the drama circles, has led the Hongliu Anti-Japanese War Theatre Troupe since its establishment in Guangzhou last year during the September 18th Incident. It immediately set out to the mainland to devote itself to the cause of national salvation. In the half-year since, it has passed through more than ten counties and deeply gained the sympathy of the mainland people. It has now moved to Enping, where its work is extremely diligent. However, the troupe has no fixed funding or subsidies, and all expenses are mostly borne by the troupe members themselves. They are now in dire straits and have been without food for two days. It is quite difficult to collect money by performing plays in the mainland, so Mr. Huang has been busy appealing to celebrities in Hong Kong, hoping that all sectors will provide assistance so that the troupe can continue to extend its spiritual mobilization and national salvation work.

### British Ambassador Kerr's Rumored Suspension of Flight to Chongqing; Chinese Affairs Secretary Denies Yesterday

Regarding the recent incidents of frequent harassment in the sky by enemy aircraft, the Hong Kong Telegraph reported the night before last that British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, initially planned to fly to Chongqing on a Eurasia Aviation Corporation plane. However, for safety reasons, he suddenly returned his ticket. This shows how much attention the enemy authorities are paying to the whereabouts of the personnel of the British Embassy in China, etc. Yesterday, many Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong translated this report. The Acting Secretary for Chinese Affairs, Mr. Callard, therefore met with reporters yesterday afternoon to make a responsible statement, saying that British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr did not suspend his flight to Chongqing on a Eurasia plane. The claim that the enemy authorities were paying attention to the whereabouts of the personnel of the British Embassy in China is even more unfounded.

### The Famous Play "Huanghuagang" Will Have Its Last Performance Tonight; Excellent Results Every Night, Audiences Are Numerous; The Plot Is Tense and Audiences Are Deeply Moved

The Hong Kong All Sectors Relief Federation, in order to raise funds to comfort the families of soldiers who died on the front lines, has jointly organized more than 30 drama troupes to perform the national revolutionary historical drama "Huanghuagang." The details have been reported in previous newspapers. This play is a great revolutionary historical drama collectively created by more than 20 writers, depicting the uprising of "Huanghuagang." It is慷慨激昂, and its content is extremely exciting, closely matching the current situation of the Anti-Japanese War. The props and costumes are all carefully designed and conform to the conditions of the time, with costumes from the Qing Dynasty vividly performed. The use of Cantonese is of great interest to overseas Chinese in Hong Kong. At the same time, more than 20 singing teams participated in the singing, making the venue even more tense and enthusiastic. On the previous two nights, the audiences were extremely crowded. Starting at 7:30 PM tonight, the last performance will still be held at the Taiping Theatre. Overseas Chinese should not miss this last good opportunity to comfort the families of the fallen soldiers, appreciate the drama, and receive revolutionary inspiration.

According to the latest news, when the play was performed to the "Finale" at 12:00 last night, the audience was deeply moved due to the tense plot. A young woman who had fled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong was so touched by the scene that she suddenly stepped onto the stage and gave a generous speech, encouraging overseas Chinese. The audience was stunned for a moment. Later, the young woman fainted due to overexcitement. This shows the greatness of the play's moving power. Due to printing time constraints, please read the special report in tomorrow's newspaper for details.

### Japanese Textiles Are Dumped in Hong Kong; This Spring's Sales Are Even More Alarming; Sales Have Reached 3 Million, Inventory Is 2 Million; British and American Textile Merchants Are Vigilant Against Japanese Goods Falsifying

The Hong Kong textile market has traditionally featured products from Britain, the United States, Germany, Japan, and other countries competing in Hong Kong, all with considerable sales volume. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the mentality of the citizens has changed, and the purchase of Japanese goods has decreased daily. Goods from Britain, the United States, and France have taken the opportunity to rise. Unexpectedly, since the beginning of spring, the situation has changed greatly. The inherent market of goods from Britain, the United States, and France has been encroached upon by Japan, and Germany is at the end of its rope. According to a certain magnate in the textile industry speaking to reporters, in the spring of this year, textiles from Britain, the United States, and France totaled less than 2 million yuan, a fold decrease compared to last year, while Japanese goods dumping reached more than 3 million yuan. The current inventory in warehouses is also worth 2 million yuan. It has been found that there are more than 40 textile merchants who have joined the Textile Association. They have taken a united step and stipulated that the business policy should be to specialize in selling goods from Britain, the United States, France, and domestic products, and issue certificates, but there are still many who have not followed suit. There are even more who have not joined the association, reaching more than 80. They take free action, and even under severe criticism from society, they can do nothing about it. Currently, manufacturers of goods from Britain, the United States, and France, in order to prevent counterfeiting and restore the market, have started recently to print the origin and manufacturer of a certain country on the selvage of every piece of cloth every one and a half yards. At the same time, the foreign firm managed dispatches secret internal staff to investigate the market. Once counterfeiting is discovered, they will be prosecuted.

### An Extraordinary Wedding: Simple but Splendid: Shu Jian Marries a Good Model; Ambassador Xu Shiying: Presents Two Words

Special Feature

Yesterday, the reporter attended a very extraordinary wedding, placing himself among high-ranking officials and wealthy merchants, prominent figures from the North and South, professors, writers, and artists.

It was the highly sensational Hu-Chen marriage in Hong Kong's upper class. The groom is the son of the great philanthropist and wealthy businessman Mr. Hu Wenhu, the young manager of this newspaper, Hu Haojun; the bride is Ms. Xiu Rong, the beloved daughter of the famous architectural designer Mr. Chen Xinghuang. The wedding location was the magnificent Tiger Balm Garden, towering on Tai Hang Road.

This palatial building had been filled with many guests from 2:00 PM onwards, and cars flowed like water on Tai Hang Road! (No horses like dragons).

Mr. Hu Wenhu stood respectfully inside the gate, greeting the arriving guests with a joyful expression. Among the various ladies and gentlemen, there were quite a few who had not visited this villa before, and they took the opportunity to tour under the guidance of the staff. The gardens outside the villa, under the rockeries, and by the pools were all locations for the tea party. I took the opportunity to conduct an informal observation, and various types of people were on display before my eyes. I discovered that this was a grand gathering of national celebrities.

At three o'clock sharp, the wedding officiant, Ambassador Xu Shiying, appeared among the crowd in the downstairs hall, wearing a neatly tailored Western suit with a bright red flower pinned to his chest. The wedding ceremony began, and the procedures were the simplest possible. After the wedding party, the officiant, and the introducer (Cai Huihong) signed the marriage certificate, the ceremony was completed.

If there was anything else, it was Ambassador Xu's congratulatory and encouraging remarks: He hoped that after the married couple were united, they would strive towards establishing virtue, words, and deeds, and contribute all they had to the motherland. He said that he wished this new couple much happiness, longevity, and many sons, and that all they had to contribute to the motherland. The reporter thought: Poor people only need happiness and longevity, and do not necessarily need many sons, but in Hu's case, it should be a common wish.

Among the countless guests, I met many famous people. To the best of my memory, there were He Xiangning, Song Ziwen, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Dongxuan, Luo Xuhhe, He Li, Liu Qingxuan, He Ailing, Hu Mulan, and others.

The above is the outline of the wedding. There is one more thing the reporter would like to briefly describe:

According to Mr. Hu Hao, this tea party only cost more than 200 yuan. The originally planned banquet fee of 3,000 yuan has been decided by his father to be donated to disaster relief for refugees, with 1,000 yuan allocated to the Relief Federation, 1,000 yuan to the Children's Welfare Association, and 1,000 yuan to the wounded soldiers' hospital. This kind of meaningful and frugal wedding is worth emulating.

### Political Department of the Fourth War Zone; Countermeasures to Deal with the Enemy's Appeasement Conspiracy; Orders Military and Political Authorities in Various Places to Regulate Supplies to Reduce the Burden on the People; Intensify Propaganda Efforts and Promote Covenants to Politically Strike the Enemy

[Qujiang Express News] The Political Department of the Fourth War Zone, based on reports that the enemy is using political tactics to win over the people's hearts, deliberately selling goods cheaply and providing money, has found that there are many ignorant villagers in various places who go to the enemy for transactions. These ignorant villagers are mostly forced by their livelihood. Recently, transportation in various places has been inconvenient, and the distribution of supplies has been uneven, resulting in a lack of daily necessities. Even if there are some, the supply does not meet the demand, and the prices are expensive. Villagers are forced by their livelihood to take risks, which is a great obstacle to the future of the war of resistance. In order to eliminate this phenomenon, specific countermeasures have been formulated and ordered to be implemented: (1) Military and political authorities in various places should find ways to regulate supplies and assess prices to ensure that supply meets demand and the burden on the people is reduced; (2) Intensify propaganda efforts to expose the enemy's conspiracy, and urge the people to earnestly fulfill the Anti-Japanese War Covenant; (3) Implement a blockade policy against the enemy area, and strictly inspect import and export trade and goods. If they are enemy goods, they will be detained and handed over to the local Anti-Japanese War Support Association for disposal, but they must not be disturbed under any pretext; (4) For private traffickers and merchants who sell enemy goods, once discovered, they should be severely punished according to the circumstances. After receiving the order, the department (1) Regarding the assessment of prices, the local defense army county government party headquarters and people's anti-Japanese support association, etc., should convene a price assessment conference based on the actual situation; (2) Regarding the detailed measures for urging the people to fulfill the Anti-Japanese War Covenant, further orders will be issued; (3) Regarding the blockade of the enemy area and the punishment of private traffickers and merchants transporting enemy goods, it should be earnestly promoted.

### Forced Ferry; Traveling on the Jiangmen-Guangzhou Line; Confiscate Boats and Operate During the Day

[Zhongshan Express News] The enemy in Jiangmen has been actively intensifying the construction of defensive fortifications in recent days to prevent our counterattacks. Many enemy soldiers are stationed at Shuinan, Zini, Jiaotou, and Kangzhou Road. The enemy is also forcing our merchants to resume business, arresting those who refuse. At the same time, they are forcing our ferries to resume the Jiangmen-Guangzhou route, confiscating boats in the Beijie area of Jiangmen, and preparing to start operating during the day in order to fulfill their dream of "prospering Guangzhou." However, our guerrillas are active near Jiangmen, which is causing the enemy great anxiety.

### The Enemy Invades Jiaji; Repelled by Our Fierce Attacks; Li and Miao People of Wuzhi Mountain Rise Up to Kill the Enemy; Enemy Ships in Qiongzhou Strait Have Decreased

[South Road Express News] Enemy troops in Qionghai recently launched a three-pronged attack on the left wing of Jiaji. The enemy troops advanced from the southeast of Chengmai, the right wing advanced from Huangzhu Dalu, and the central route advanced from Wenchang to Yandun. The three-pronged enemy forces suffered heavy casualties after being fiercely attacked by us and gradually showed signs of collapse. They have collapsed to Chengmai. At the moment, the Miao and Li ethnic groups in the Qiongya Valley have risen up to fight the war. More than 10,000 brave Miao and Li people have gathered in the Wuzhi Mountain area near Ding'an to assist our regular army in the war. In the Qiongzhou Strait, the number of enemy ships has decreased recently, presumably they have been transferred elsewhere. The situation in Xuwen has gradually eased from tension. Enemy ships docked at Haikou have been fully loaded with enemy soldiers and have been sailing east one after another, seemingly transporting reinforcements to Guangzhou.

### Enemy Ships Off the Coast of Haifeng; Troops Land from Liantian; Looting Food; Enemy Ships Then Sail Elsewhere; Authorities in Haifeng and Lufeng Strictly Suppress the Big Sword Society

[Bolo Express News] According to intelligence from the military authorities here, on the 2nd of this month, two enemy ships and five armored speedboats were spotted off the coast of Haifeng. More than 70 enemy soldiers landed from Liantian and looted food from nearby villages. They then fled back to the shore and boarded the boats. The enemy ships also sailed elsewhere. At 1:00 PM on the same day, two enemy aircraft reconnoitered over Bolo City for a while, then flew southeast, passing over the suburbs of Huiyang City, and continued to fly west. Furthermore, in the recent period, an illegal organization calling itself the Big Sword Society has been discovered in Hailufeng. Its members are active everywhere. The authorities have learned that this is the work of Han traitors, attempting to disrupt the security of the rear and seize the opportunity to act. Orders have been issued to strictly investigate and suppress them.

### Tense War Situation; Refugees Are Exempted from Poll Tax When Entering Vietnam; The Governor-General of Vietnam Stipulates Four Measures; Notifies Border Counties to Investigate

[Fangcheng Express News] Since the enemy's invasion of Vietnam, there has recently been a large-scale conspiracy to land in Qinlian and attack Guilin. The Vietnamese authorities, in order to unite with friendly countries, have specially stipulated four rules for accommodating refugees after the fall of neighboring counties and cities bordering Vietnam: (1) When neighboring border areas fall, refugees in various places may temporarily be exempted from paying poll tax and move to live within the Vietnamese border. The time limit is set at three months. After the deadline, they will pay poll tax in accordance with the usual entry procedures. However, within the deadline, refugees must find a local gang leader to guarantee them, submit a report to the local government, and request issuance, otherwise they will be charged with fraud and severely punished if found out in the future; (2) Refugees from the occupied war zones who wish to settle in Vietnam, in addition to those who are able to support themselves, will be housed by the local government in designated locations; (3) If counties, townships, and towns in neighboring border areas encounter air raids, flexible measures may be taken to allow them to enter the country temporarily to take refuge, but the defense areas are still limited to those designated by the local government; (4) After the air raid alarm is lifted, they must immediately evacuate the air defense locations. The Vietnamese Governor-General has ordered the commander of the First Military District of Mang Street to be notified of the above four refugee accommodation measures, and also to notify the Fangcheng County Government and the Dongxing Police Station to investigate.

### Wartime Food Management Committee; Circulates Rice in Various Places; Strictly Prevents Dishonest Manipulation

[Qujiang Express News] The Guangdong Wartime Food Management Committee believes that the rice in various counties has not been interconnected in the past, resulting in high rice prices and suffering for the poor. Moreover, due to procurement difficulties, the food supply for the military and civilians is sometimes insufficient. It is urgent to find ways to circulate it, especially to provide practical assistance for the procurement and supply of food for the garrison troops, and to strictly prevent dishonest manipulation that would aid the enemy, in order to maintain military and civilian use. Yesterday, it submitted a request to the provincial government to order the counties and cities to comply.

### National Production Conference Opens: Guangdong Province's Wartime Agricultural Plan

(Chongqing Airmail) The National Production Conference is scheduled to open on the 5th of May. Representatives from various provinces have already reported for duty before the due date, numbering no less than several hundred people. From Guangdong and Guangxi, Guangxi Province has the most proposals. The attendees are Construction Department Director Chen Xiong, Agricultural Management Office Director Chen Daning, and Liuzhou Branch Station Director of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station Ma Baozhi. From Guangdong Province, in addition to Industrial Management Office Director Wei Baoxiang, Gu Guifen, Dean of the College of Agriculture at Lingnan University, is unable to attend and has been replaced by He Boping, Commissioner of the Agricultural Products Promotion Association. Mr. He was recently invited by the authorities to come to Guangdong to conduct inspections and provide assistance. Mr. He has completed his inspection and returned to Chongqing to report, and has drafted an outline of the Guangdong Wartime Agricultural Plan, which is excerpted below:

Guangdong Wartime Agricultural Plan Outline - Introduction

We have been resisting violence, promoting justice, and striving for national freedom and equality in this war of resistance for over twenty months. Under the grand premise of "Victory First," we must not only mobilize the nation's manpower, financial resources, and materials to deal with the enemy, but also cultivate national strength and increase production to provide long-term support and secure the victory. Our country is founded on agriculture. Wartime agricultural production is the primary foundation of the war economy and should be vigorously developed to achieve success. Guangdong is a coastal province, and food production is particularly insufficient. At this moment, as the military situation is unfolding, we must take overall consideration and plan comprehensively to meet the needs of the wartime environment, reducing the central authorities' concerns and burdens. Since Guangzhou fell to the enemy, the relocation of people from the war zones and refugee relief have been of utmost importance. If we can improve agriculture throughout the province and cultivate all the districts, then disaster relief efforts will naturally achieve twice the result with half the effort, so as not to merely treat the head when it hurts or the foot when it hurts, while the problem remains difficult to resolve completely. Agricultural technology, in peacetime, requires both knowledge and experience, improvement and supervised implementation, all based on scientific principles, proceeding step by step to achieve the ultimate goal. In wartime, we should concentrate young people who are rich in agricultural knowledge and experience and can work hard and strive forward, delve into the countryside, thoroughly improve farmers' living habits, raise farmers' educational standards, stabilize the rural economy and finance, and at the same time, promote short-term crops with the results of scientific research, spread improved seeds, and advocate the widespread planting of miscellaneous grains, both considering academic theories and closely fitting practical needs, striving to improve quality and increase quantity, balancing supply and demand, to achieve the goal of consolidating the national economy and completing the great cause of resisting the war and building the nation. President Kong intends to convene a national production conference in the near future to promote national production and strengthen the war effort, with the aim of conducting a comprehensive review of national production and establishing a comprehensive development plan for balanced implementation. Based on this purpose, I have drafted an outline of the Guangdong Wartime Agricultural Plan, as detailed below, for adoption. These humble opinions may not be of much help. I respectfully ask for corrections from wise people at home and abroad.

(1) Improving Agricultural Administrative Organizations

The Ministry of Economic Affairs, considering that the administrative organizations in various provinces were complex, disorganized, wasteful, and ineffective, urged all provinces to consolidate all original agricultural agencies and establish agricultural improvement institutes for unified planning and greater efficiency. This province (the original Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry had a large organization and high expenses, focusing on science, while neglecting the promotion of agriculture in villages, wasting resources and achieving little effect, especially felt during wartime), should reorganize the bureau into the Guangdong Agricultural Improvement Institute (with a simple organization, strict management, and intensified supervision and promotion of agricultural work throughout the province) to meet the urgent needs of the environment. This aligns with the central government's intention to promote agriculture, and the method for subsidizing agricultural improvement expenditures in various provinces, announced by the Ministry of Economic Affairs on May 18, 1938, can be cited to apply for a subsidy of half of the institute's operating expenses, to facilitate its operations. Once the administrative organization is improved to perfection, all plans will be easily implemented.

(2) Actively Establishing Provincial Agricultural Extension Agencies

To increase agricultural production, develop the rural economy, and improve farmers' lives, we should disseminate the excellent results of our agricultural research and experimentation to farmers for improvement. To achieve this goal, an extension system must be established, with the Agricultural Products Promotion Committee responsible for supervising the implementation of agricultural extension affairs nationwide. According to the draft outline of the National Agricultural Extension Implementation Plan regarding provincial extension organization regulations, this province should have the Agricultural Improvement Institute set up agricultural affairs and implementation offices, and an agricultural extension office. At the same time, the Construction Department should, in conjunction with the Provincial Party Headquarters and other relevant agricultural extension agencies, establish a Provincial Agricultural Extension Coordination Association to jointly discuss and brainstorm, to increase work efficiency. What is particularly important is the completion of extension organizations in each county, which is the most important foundation of an extension agency. We should carefully consider the environment and handle it cautiously. The Agricultural Products Promotion Committee has drafted several different formats for the organization of extension agencies in each county, to be adopted flexibly according to local conditions, including: (A) those promoted and established by the provincial agricultural extension authority, (B) those promoted and established by the county government, (C) those promoted and established by farmers' organizations, and (D) those directly promoted and established by the central authority. It is believed that since the province has established an extension organization, it should be initiated by the provincial extension organization, in conjunction with the relevant organizations in each county and province, and request technical and economic assistance from the central government.

(3) Regulating the Marketing of Agricultural Products in Various Regions

Since the relocation of the war zone in this province, both exports and imports have been difficult. The agricultural products in various regions have either been lost due to panic or due to surplus, and have not been reasonably regulated. The Ministry of Economic Affairs considered food regulation to be of utmost importance and drafted measures for food regulation during extraordinary times, which were announced by the Executive Yuan last June and instructed all provincial governments and the Agricultural Products Bureau's adjustment offices to comply with. Recently, some counties in Chaozhou and Shantou in this province have experienced rice shortages. The reasons are complex, but the lack of a well-functioning provincial regulation mechanism has had a significant impact. This province urgently needs to establish a sound transportation mechanism, and the greatest efforts must be made in market management and traffic adjustment.

(4) Launching a Rural Financial Mobilization Campaign throughout the Province

Our people have traditionally had a habit of hoarding money, especially farmers. Farmers are willing to endure hardship, save on food and clothing, and accumulate gold and silver jewelry. Even when they are extremely poor, they are often unwilling to pawn the gold and silver jewelry they acquired at their wedding. Farmers are ignorant and often bury these ornaments underground, believing this is the safest way to store them. According to general estimates, there are at least hundreds of millions of dollars still stored in rural areas throughout the country. This province should launch a province-wide rural gold and silver mobilization campaign, conduct large-scale and effective publicity, ensuring that farmers understand the meaning of the war of resistance and the use of ornaments, and earnestly encourage them to purchase them through persuasion. Overseas Chinese, who have lived abroad for a long time, are very patriotic and have always been eager to help. We should encourage them to invest in rural production and establish clear regulations as a clear sign of credibility. As for adjusting rural finance, it is a matter of utmost urgency, which is the responsibility of the financial authorities, so I will not offer presumptuous opinions. (Continued tomorrow)

### Chaplin's New Film "The Great Dictator" Plot to be Officially Released at the End of September

"The Great Dictator," currently in production, is the most watched film right now. The scope of attention is not limited to Hollywood, but the world, and even Hitler is watching closely.

"The Great Dictator" is attracting attention for three reasons: first, it is Chaplin's first film in four years since "Modern Times"; second, Chaplin officially speaks in this film; and third, in this film, there is extremely humorous and sharp satire of the head of a certain dictatorship.

In the past, we only knew that the story of "The Great Dictator" would be set in a country under the rule of a certain dictator. Chaplin plays two important roles in this film, one is a prisoner in a concentration camp, and the other is the dictator of this country.

In early March of this year, the film officially started filming. A reporter interviewed him about the film's news and Chaplin's own opinions. At that time, Chaplin only said: "I don't want to tell you for the time being, but I want you to know that there will be a big scene in this film that requires many actors, and I want to use as many Jews and Germans as possible."

Now, Chaplin has publicly released the content of "The Great Dictator." The script was written by an unknown British writer living in Los Angeles, titled "The Great Dictator," and another title is: "The Story of a Small # in a World Full of Sharks." As for the plot, it tells the adventure story of a "fool" named Charlie.

The general situation of the story is as follows:

"In 1912, 'Bordamania' and 'Irie' went to war. 'Fool' Charlie is a private in the 'Bordamania' army. When the war ends, he is the only survivor of the team. When he returned to the capital of 'Bordamania', 'Bordda', everything had changed and was very different from before the war. One day, he was taking a nap when he was suddenly awakened by a team of advancing troops, who were whipping the people to 'support' the dictator of 'Bordamania', Hiegel. Startled, Charlie fled into a restaurant, where the restaurant owner gave him a free meal. As a result, all the restaurant's furniture was destroyed by the advancing troops, and Charlie was sent to a concentration camp by the army. But one day he escaped. From then on, he had good luck. That day, the dictator Hiegel was traveling incognito. Because the two looked alike, the guards recognized Charlie as their leader, while the real dictator Hiegel entered the concentration camp as a person pretending to be a leader. Charlie had good luck, and gave a speech to the people, and his beautiful speech made the people of the country very happy. The ending is: 'Fool' Charlie wakes up from his dream and finds that he is still detained in the concentration camp..."

After reading the content of this script, we already know who the satirical target of this film is. Of course, the jokes in the whole film must be very rich. No wonder Chaplin announced the general content of this film, and the entire American movie fans paid more attention to "The Great Dictator." This film started shooting in early March and will probably be released in September of this year. At that time, the happiness of movie fans and the # anger of the dictator must be predictable. Let's wait and see.

### Theatrical Activities in Chengdu

Last May, a "Sichuan Traveling Troupe" appeared in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, and set off to perform plays or sing in the border areas. In those places, some residents did not even know that China and Japan had gone to war, because these places usually cannot receive radio broadcasts and newspapers. After seven months, they recently returned to Chengdu.

The troupe includes thirteen male members and six female members, implementing a kind of collective collaboration and collective life. In seven months, they contacted about one million people. As for the lives of the troupe members, they are very hard, and each person only receives one yuan per month for pocket money.

The plays performed included "Put Down Your Whip," "The Sacrifice of September 18," "Defend Lugou Bridge," "Poison," etc., and the slogans shouted were "Those who have strength give strength, those who have money give money," "Total War of Resistance," etc.

After returning to Chengdu, they performed the play "Three Rivers," which tells the story of a person in "Manchukuo" organizing a guerrilla army. Later, they also performed "Crossing the Yellow River." Like them, similar troupes have now spread all over China. In terms of art, they are not necessarily the most advanced, but the actors are sincere and enthusiastic, making them extremely important figures in China's war of resistance.

In addition, under the name of the Ministry of Education, there is also a "Traveling Singing Troupe." Many of the leaders and members of this group are graduates of the Shanghai National Conservatory of Music. There are a total of eighteen young men and women. They are now traveling and singing in various cities in Sichuan, making people understand why China must struggle. The songs they sing are also rhythmic, and the meaning is to seek China's freedom and independence.

Universities from all over China that have moved to Chengdu, students also united and often perform ancient music dramas, collecting donations and contributing to the country. Among them, the Wartime Service Group of the Five Universities performed a play called "Goodbye, Tokyo," which was written by a Japanese student, describing the various oppressions encountered by Chinese students studying in Japan, and some Japanese scholars also expressed their dislike of the war.

### Husband, Wife, Friend (3)

He kept singing in front of the mirror as he entered the bathroom. The tune was even brighter. With a bang, the glass on the washbasin stand fell. His singing was cut off. He tiptoed back into the bedroom.

He was falling asleep when Doris cried, "Are you asleep?"

"Uh."

After a while, he said again: "Mother and Uncle Hugo have already come back tonight."

Leona was motionless for a while, then he lifted the quilt, turned over and sat on the edge of the bed. Doris's back was facing him, and he could see her clearly in the moonlight. "That's going to start again," he said softly. Alas, Hugo is back in Europe again!

She asked, "I don't understand what you mean."

"If I see that thing, Hugo, in the house, I will kick him out, you understand?"

"Understood, my love," she replied.

He lay down again. Hugo—that hateful singing teacher—Leona decided that Hugo's coming at this time would cause trouble. But he had a way to deal with it. Thinking of this, he fell asleep. Looking back on the matter afterwards, Leona never understood how it happened. He only knew that he didn't understand women's psychology very well.

After he sent Hugo out of the apartment, Doris still continued to learn to sing. Once Doris was going to perform at a concert at City Hall, he forced all his acquaintances to buy tickets, and sure enough, all the tickets were sold out? (To be continued)

### Doubles Tennis Semifinals: He and Li Achieve Glorious Victory, Overwhelming the Lin Brothers to Win the Finals

The Hong Kong Open Doubles Grass Court Tennis Semifinals took place yesterday afternoon between the Lin Brothers and He Jialiu and Li Rurong. On the eve of the great battle, no one could predict that the He and Li pair would win. Although their tenacity and strategy had driven away many famous players, when they met the Lin Brothers, who had been cooperating for many years and were strong and fierce, everyone thought that they were more likely to suffer a defeat. Unexpectedly, the fate of the Lin Brothers was similar to that of the Navy team, a strong team in this year's Group A football league. At this critical moment, they were defeated by the He and Li pair. Not only was there no hope for the championship, but even the runner-up position was lost.

Yesterday, the He and Li pair thoroughly understood the opponent's weaknesses, avoided the heavy and took the light, and adopted a strategy of overcoming strength with softness. Therefore, when the two good partners encountered the opponent's fierce shots, they stood on the baseline and steadily returned high balls that were soft and tough, making the two Lins dazzled. When there was a good opportunity, Old Li would rush to the net and use a soft horizontal or backhand to beat them, making it impossible for the two Lins to cope. Although Old He had some mistakes, it did not hurt the overall situation. His forehand sweep often had accurate landing points. When Da Linzhen encountered some trouble, he felt like an elephant being disturbed by a small mouse. At the same time, the tenacious defense method of He and Li was very strong, not afraid of being hit or pressed. The two Lins always adopted a soft way, which was exactly what they planned. This point made the two Lins defeated and lost all three sets.

The performance of the two Lins was not below their usual standard. Their good skills in blocking the net were performed as usual. Unfortunately, the violent pressure could not kill the soft counterattacks of He and Li. In the fierce battle, Da Linzhen's temper was tested by the opponent. Therefore, He and Li always sent the counterattacking ball to Da Linzhen's side, making him exhausted. Little Linzhen on the side could not help. Therefore, Da Lin's forehand fierce shot gradually weakened. In the life-and-death moment of the last set, he was unable to counterattack. Little Linzhen was also powerless, so he failed. He and Li thus won the final with the Xu brothers. Such a good work is also proud.

### Game Process

First set After the contest, Old He first showed off his power, and with Old Li's cooperation from the side, he took the first game. From then on, the battle situation gradually became tense. The fight was very interesting. When they held on to five to four, the two Lins still took the lead. Suddenly, Old He volleyed the ball and tied the score to five to five. Then it was six to six. At this time, Da Linzhen shot at Old Li's position, and Old Li was broken repeatedly. Fortunately, Old He was brave and good at fighting, attacking from far and near, and doing everything with ease. He held on to seven to seven and then recovered the critical situation, and its turning point was also based on this. Finally, under the repeated efforts, Old He performed uniquely, and Old Li also cooperated properly. He won two more games and won the first set with nine to seven.

Second set The two Lins lost the first battle and hoped to recover the lost ground, sometimes retreating and drawing from afar, and sometimes pressing on the net, coming fiercely. He and Li had to take a step back for the time being. However, Old He was experienced after all and saw the opponent's weakness, often attacking Da Linzhen's side. In addition, Old Li's pressure in front of the net was always advantageous. The situation turned for the better again. After tying the score to three to three, he achieved a complete victory in one breath and won the second set with six to three.

Third set He and Li took advantage of the victory and became more and more energetic, but the Lin brothers were not weak after all and still thought about reversing the situation. However, Da Linzhen was exhausted after two sets of hard fighting. He and Li refused to relax and specialized in opposing him, making Little Linzhen on the side unable to help. Therefore, when the battle reached four to four, the two Lins revealed flaws again. Even if they tried hard to struggle, they would lose as soon as they got it. The situation was extremely tense from five to five to six to six. Moreover, the two Lins were thinking about it at this time. The eagerness to win backfired and made things worse. They were suppressed by He and Li, and their footing was unstable, so the general trend was gone. At eight to six, He and Li completed the last set and won the glorious victory. The results are as follows

He Jialiu Li Rurong

win

Da Linzhen Xiao Linzhen

Nine to seven

Six to three

Eight to six

### South China vs. Sailors Rescheduled for Tomorrow

Today, a practice match was originally scheduled with the sailors of the British warship "Desperate" at Jia Hill. However, the sailors happened to have something to do today and had no time to play. With the consent of South China, it was changed to 4:30 tomorrow afternoon. The location is still struggling. (Tung Long)

### Swimming Pool Tour

(Special Report) The weather in the South, once the flowers bloom, the climate suddenly changes strangely. The sun hangs high in the sky like a fiery umbrella. The entire earth is steamed by hot fog, roasting people's muscles until they sweat. People of the bourgeoisie stage who are used to living in this comfort nest, everyone is willing to run to the beach to seek entertainment. So when the sun sets, the Seven Sisters and the coast of West Ring present an infinite and beautiful scenery. Look, the blue waves swaying in the light breeze, those pairs of lovers, tumbling in the waves, floating and sinking, are very happy. Sometimes, the delicate anger in the waves will make people fascinated, and sometimes there will be a wisp of clear song, and the lingering sound is lingering. This life in the sea country is really worth paying attention to. Now, all swimming venues have been opened in advance to meet the needs of men and women. The reporter spent a day yesterday touring the swimming pools and specially reported everything he learned to people who love swimming.

South China The South China Association Swimming Pool is the largest venue on the island. All the equipment is very complete. Especially this season, the venue has been decorated with a new look. The dressing room is also arranged in an orderly manner. Speaking of lifeboats, in addition to the dedicated sailors who are assigned to rescue in the middle of the stream every day in case of an emergency, a siren platform is also built on the bridge. If an accident occurs, the alarm bell will sound naturally. The administrator Zeng Boyuan said, "Although this venue is now open, there are not many men and women who come to swim every day. This is certainly because the weather is not too hot yet.

In this transition between old and new staff, there are still many things that have been put on hold. Once the new staff takes over, there may be various additions to this venue. The water games association will be held soon. "

Chinese The Chinese Swimming Pool was also opened in May. The venue is beautifully decorated. At night, the electric lights in the venue illuminate it as if it were daytime, and the colorful waves reflect each other.

This session has elected Zeng Hefu as the general manager, who is very serious in his work. The facilities of the venue are orderly and tidy, giving everyone who comes to the venue to relax a feeling of being in the Guanghan Palace. Especially when admiring the moonlit night with the sea breeze, sitting on the bridge and listening to the sound of the sea waves, it is really unforgettable.

Bell Sound The Bell Sound Swimming Pool has also been opened. The construction of the shed bridge is very complete, and there are also warp bars on the bridge platform, which are being decorated. Although the venue is in a corner of the West Ring, there are actually many people who come to swim every summer. Residents in the West Ring like to go to the venue for amusement because it is convenient to travel back and forth. It is said that this year it is stipulated that it will open at 8:00 am every morning and close at 11:00 pm.

China This season, China Swimming Competition is also actively reforming management. The bamboo bridge in the venue is currently being repaired quickly. It is said that the number of members who have joined this year has increased compared to last year, and it has been scheduled to open on the 7th of this month. A water games fair will be held at the time of opening, and it is a good place to enjoy the moment.

Others There are also swimming pools such as the Chinese Staff Youth Association, Wing On, Dahua, and Bank, which are all newly decorated, waiting for people who like to swim to come. In short, in the near future, the Seven Sisters coast will become a gathering place for young men and women again. The beach is full of fragrant clothes and beautiful shadows, which is a unique scenery. (Sanmu)

### Philippine Travel Notes

— —Hui Tang—

Introduction

This year's soccer events have come to a close. The Hong Kong Football Association has taken the opportunity to reciprocate and invite the Philippine team, so as to show respect for the courtesy of exchange. I recall that at the beginning of the year, the Philippine team came to us for the first time, communicating the voices of the soccer circles in the two places, strengthening the friendship between the two associations, and laying a permanent foundation for the inter-city competition, adding a golden page to the history of Hong Kong soccer. The contribution of the pioneers cannot be ignored. Although the team returned north with three defeats in Hong Kong, their fighting spirit is worthy of praise. Those who know the situation say that their level of soccer skill is similar to that of the Hong Kong side. I agree with this view. However, this time the Hong Kong team is invading the south, facing advantages of timing, location and popularity. Moreover, fighting under the lights at night is not what the Hong Kong people are used to. Enthusiastic people, both Chinese and foreigners, are worried about our team. Some even ask me, as the leader of the team, about the chances of winning this trip. Their concern is overflowing in their words. I said that competing in the Philippines is a bit too hot. The South China players all have considerable experience in night games and will not suffer too much. If there are no surprises, then considering the strength, there should be good news coming back to Hong Kong to comfort the soccer fans. However, soccer matches are always changing, and who can predict the outcome? Everyone should do their best and strive to achieve the goal. That is all I can say about judging oneself and others.

Setting Sail on April 27th

Our team's return trip to the Philippines has been planned and prepared in advance, and all passport procedures have been completed. We are scheduled to depart on the President Cleveland tonight at one o'clock. According to the shipping company, the team includes eight members of the National Army, two Portuguese soldiers, and four foreign soldiers. Little Shi has been excused due to a sudden illness of a colleague. The team leader "Limping" A-chi, and the association representative Jian Jin, are also with us. Counting them all, there are eighteen people. There are also my colleague and old friend Mr. Liang Zao-ru, and Ms. Gao Shan-nu, who are accompanying us on the trip. With such a harmonious group, this trip will not be lonely. After dinner, around ten o'clock, everyone boarded the ship. At the pier, there were staff members from the Hong Kong Football Association and the South China Athletic Association, reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers, and relatives and friends of the team members, more than a hundred people in all, sitting around in the smoking room, sharing drinks and having a good time. My six-year-old daughter Shan-shan, encouraged by her older siblings, performed dances, sword dances, and operas to entertain the guests, earning endless laughter. Someone said that she would become Hong Kong's Shirley Temple. I gave her a ten-dollar bill as a reward for her hard work, which she immediately handed over to her mother, and then jumped and cheered with pride. At midnight, the farewell party ended, and everyone shook hands and wished us victory, with great sincerity and earnestness. Fortunately, it was only a short separation, so there was no need to be too emotional. "The water in Kowloon Bay is a thousand feet deep, but it is not as deep as the affection of those who see me off." The friendship of relatives and friends is worth remembering. In particular, the eccentric in the soccer field "Silent Man" was reluctant to leave and repeatedly gestured to me, earnestly asking me to send him reports of the soccer matches. I appreciated his sincerity and nodded in agreement, and he left with joy. After the ship set sail, I realized that I had played tennis for almost two hours during the day, and then I had to pack my luggage. Both my mind and body were exhausted. I changed clothes and fell asleep as soon as I got into bed. Although the cargo ship was rattling and the sound was like spring thunder, it was not enough to disturb my good dreams.

### Drizzle

— Jie Jie

An unexpected drizzle started again, so fine that it was like the tip of an autumn hair, flying onto the glass window and blurring it.

The drizzle flew to the earth, and the tiny water droplets merged together, wetting the earth.

The drizzle flew onto people's faces, like steel needles, pricking the face painfully.

The drizzle also flew onto people's bodies, drilling into the gaps in their clothes, squeezing out water.

This drizzle falls again and again, continuously. What is it for after all?

The earth is covered with dust, dirt, meanness, and shamelessness. It suffocates people's breathing, obscures people's vision, taints pure people with filth, and suppresses noble people. The devil takes the opportunity to rampage, and the world is going crazy!

People, in this situation, completely lost their minds, as if they had taken an incurable drug, unable to distinguish everything, without any resistance, obediently prostrating at the feet of the devil, allowing the devils to play with them and bully them.

The careers that people are engaged in have all come to a standstill because they have lost their masters. What is destroyed is destroyed, what is defiled is defiled, and they can no longer emit the light that they once did to assist people. The entire society is immediately regressing, and will never move forward.

Darkness engulfs the whole world…

The drizzle cannot bear this situation, it does not want to endure it any longer, it wants to wash and purify the whole world, drive away the devil, so that dust, dirt, meanness, and shamelessness will never grow again. It gathers its courage, although its strength is so small. But it flies relentlessly, once, twice, three times, flying, flying, flying.

The glass window is blurred, it is making people wipe it, driving away the darkness and seeing the light again.

The earth is wet, it is making people wash away the dust and dirt, to obtain clarity.

People's faces ache, it is making people alert, not to dream anymore, quickly extinguish the external attacks and arrogance.

Drilling into the fabric of clothes, it is making people have the courage and perseverance to stop the devil's erosion, and to strive to resist!

Falling again and again, it is training people to have a lasting spirit to fight, not allowing them to stop in the middle!

Oh, the continuous drizzle, how great it is!

We uphold the spirit of struggle, we receive the suggestion of the drizzle, we come to purify our society, and apply it to the entire earth. The light is ahead!

The misty drizzle flying outside the window is the lamp to abolish darkness!

### The Destruction of Flattering Education

— Zuo Yi

The commercialization of schools, where knowledge is a commodity and students are customers, has become a common phenomenon in the education sector here. If it were not so, no one would care about your school. However, how to ensure that the customers you attract are all wealthy, and how to increase the number of customers day by day, has become a difficult problem that principals are painstakingly pondering. This has given rise to "business geniuses."

This place is full of gentlemen and rich people. When a gentleman or a rich person buys an item, the quality of the contents does not matter to him, it is the expensiveness and gorgeousness of the decoration that please him most. Good quality and low prices would make them feel that their status has been lowered, and would inevitably be met with their contempt and resentment.

Sending their children to school is no exception. Catering to the wishes of these gentlemen and rich people, educational opportunists put gorgeous shells on their shoddy goods. This can solve the difficult problem they were painstakingly pondering. What outstanding "business geniuses!"

In a school standing on the hillside, patriotic songs have disappeared and jazz music has taken its place. The music teacher said: Patriotic songs are not suitable in Hong Kong.

What kind of students does this kind of school educate? It is almost impossible to find a pragmatic and diligent one among them. Their extravagance in life is not inferior to the enthusiasm of their parents for enjoyment, nor is it less than their fathers and brothers. Teachers who dress simply will inevitably be despised by them. Even the simplest question is foreign to them. They will not only not be "the future masters of the country," but will be "harmful elements of the country's future." They cannot take on the responsibility of "the future masters of the country," but will only consume the country's production.

Since the fall of Guangzhou, many progressive schools have moved here from the mainland. Some students who still have reason have been awakened and have left the dangerous side and gradually moved towards progress. A struggle has begun to threaten the education of flattery. It is hoped that these progressive schools can, in their own solidness and strength, eradicate this education of flattery. Because this education is just a speculation that caters to the hedonism of the gentlemen and rich people. The direction is wrong, and the effect produced is harmful. Eradication is necessary.

### The Significance of Celebrating Youth Day (Continued)

— Li Zheng Yao, Xie Yu De

(5) The work is isolated, and there is no contact with student movements at home and abroad. In fact, the Hong Kong student movement was originally inseparable from the world student movement. Only by establishing close ties with the world student movement can the Hong Kong student movement have a bright future. In addition, the inability of participating students to adapt to the environment, abandoning schoolwork, and acting in opposition to their families are also shortcomings of the Hong Kong student movement.

With the increasing tension of the war situation, schools in the war zone and occupied areas have moved south to Hong Kong one after another. In this way, Hong Kong not only became an important city in the rear of our country during the war, but also became the center of the Chinese student movement. Therefore, our responsibility in the future is even greater. We should quickly overcome the shortcomings of our past work and take on the urgent tasks at hand.

The current tasks of the Hong Kong student movement are:

(1) Prepare for wartime work. The international situation is becoming increasingly dangerous, and a second world war is likely to recur today. Before the war comes, we should raise the awareness of Hong Kong students about the war and encourage them to participate in various wartime technical training classes, such as first aid classes, air defense and anti-virus classes, etc. In this way, even if the war unfortunately breaks out, students staying in Hong Kong can assist the Allied governments to strengthen the defense of the port. Those who return to the country will also have a skill that can directly participate in the national liberation war.

(2) Strengthening international propaganda and striving for international assistance is one of the important conditions for winning the final victory. Hong Kong is an area where Chinese and foreigners gather. On the one hand, it is close to the motherland, and on the other hand, it is connected to overseas countries. In addition, the foreign language level of students here is higher than that in the mainland. Therefore, strengthening international propaganda and making the atrocities of the invaders in China known to the world has become one of the most important tasks of the Hong Kong student movement in the future.

(3) Conscientiously promote the National Spiritual Mobilization. The National Spiritual Mobilization advocated by the Supreme Leader Chiang Kai-shek is the most historically significant movement of the Chinese nation. Students are the vanguard of the Chinese national liberation, and undoubtedly, they should promote this movement with all their strength. We should not only enable all students in Hong Kong to have a thorough understanding of the meaning of "national supremacy, national supremacy, military first, victory first, concentration of will, and concentration of strength," but also enable them to automatically correct their decadent lives, develop an enterprising spirit, break the attempts of selfishness and self-interest, and correct divergent and mixed ideas. In short, we must ensure that the phenomenon of "one side is serious work and the other side is debauchery and shamelessness" does not exist in the Hong Kong student community.

(4) Broadly develop various life interest activities and conscientiously promote the reading of books and newspapers. According to the different interests of the students in each school, broadly develop different organizations for each subject, such as singing classes, reading clubs, harmonica classes, travel groups, photography research classes, swimming teams, etc., so that all students in Hong Kong can unite in different interest activities for each subject. At the same time, natural sciences and emerging social sciences related to the War of Resistance and national construction, as well as new and progressive newspapers and magazines, should also be systematically introduced to the students in each school.

In addition, promoting central cultural cooperation and strengthening fundraising activities have also become the main tasks of the Hong Kong student movement in the future.

Dear students, the tasks placed before us are arduous. Let us unite, concentrate our strength, and accomplish our great tasks!

### Drifters

— Le Shu

It was a late afternoon, with a great deal of blowing sand, when we arrived at our destination, Tasha County in northwestern Jiangsu.

A long, flowing group advanced windingly forward. In the twilight, thousands of human figures drifted, stepping on the soft, powdery soil. One shadow touching another, connected into an endless iron great wall, the end of which, with its iron tail, was hidden from sight.

To reduce the size of the target, this iron torrent flowed into every village, spreading out into places that could mutually support each other.

I was a member of a certain unit. There were about twenty of us in total, and we found a place to rest in Jizhuang, a village about half a mile from Jieshan City. Preliminary work began in this ancient and simple village.

The common people did not cast horrified glances at the gray shadows, but rather expressions of excitement flowed from every simple face. Even the elderly would come, leaning on their canes, to offer warm greetings as if to their own sons. What they held within was a joyful heart. This could be sensed from every clear and hurried breath.

News spread quickly in the village. Within half an hour of our arrival, the courtyard was filled with dozens of innocent children, all of school age. Each child raised their head and opened their eyes wide, blinking repeatedly. They made no sound, paying attention, listening to every unfamiliar action and every unfamiliar word of our group, like paying attention in a classroom. Here we were, scrutinizing their lovable faces, how deeply impressed we were.

We began to chat haphazardly in Mandarin. They seemed a little strange to us changing to a different language, but understanding our generalizations without effort, they all quickly shifted their bodies into a more casual posture. In the dim starlight, their faces could faintly be seen blushing, and their eyes sparkled with crystal light, making them listen with even more excitement. They eagerly answered the questions we asked.

There was no sense of strangeness, no hesitation. We were as close as brothers reunited after a long separation.

They told us that they were still studying at the village elementary school less than two miles away, and that they were not shaken in their determination by the threat of gunfire. They told us their names, and the older children even explained the simple meaning of the current resistance war, which they had retrieved from the memory of what their teacher had said.

So we suggested a few songs that everyone knew and asked them to sing along with us. They understood simple rounds and even understood to watch the movements of my hand to determine the pitch and tempo of the sound.

The sharp singing resounded throughout this quiet village.

Small children, big children, men, women, flowed into a vast sea of people. The adults wanted to call the children to eat dinner, but they were captivated by the singing and did not speak their words. The children even forgot that their stomachs were hungry.

The majestic singing spread throughout the fields, penetrating deep into everyone's hearts.

### Intoxication

— Liu Yi

It is like a sweet smile, permeating people's souls, obscuring their reason, making them forget everything, even themselves!

As if gone mad, when people encounter that intoxicating dream, intoxicating wine, intoxicating laughter, intoxicating singing, and everything with seductive magic, they are like lost in a maze. They love this intoxication, this intoxication containing poison.

But people's hearts are so haggard that they cannot withstand the slightest anesthesia. When they are trapped in this abyss, they do not even know that they have entered the land of intoxication. They think they are still the most sober people.

Those who are intoxicated are not as good as those in a dream. That dangerous and precarious situation, that attraction hiding evil intentions, in their minds, they think this is the giving of an enthusiastic person, the most valuable prelude.

In the land of intoxication, all troubles are abandoned, all dangers are forgotten, and people are surrounded by joy!

That wine, that dream, that laughter, that singing... makes people obsessed with them, makes people dive into their whirlpools, that is intoxication.

Intoxication, no one sees that it is terrible, and no one believes that it has given people many unfavorable attacks. Intoxication has an "insidiousness" that makes people unexpected. This is intoxication, the most terrible thing in the world, the most to be avoided!

### Manchurian Snow

— Shu Qun

"Hey, don't be angry, wait a minute."

He hoped she would see for herself, which would have the opposite effect of reading the newspaper. He was afraid that after opening the door, she would be humiliated and his secret would be revealed, so he had to guide her eyes to the keyhole next to the door for a furtive peek. The moment she saw it, she couldn't help but shout:

"You beasts... not human, not human!... Do you still have a bit of human form?... You are even worse than dogs——"

He covered her mouth with his hand, letting her continue to watch quietly. Her words were stopped, but unstoppable tears, like a broken string of pearls, fell one by one. If she were not weak, she would rush out and duel with the two most immoral drunks outside the door. She would rather be defeated than be tolerant. If her emotions were further stimulated, he would use the sharp knife he used on Yuwen last night to deal with them—even if she knew the result would be the same as last night, or worse. Therefore, she was dragged away.

That brief moment made her deeply aware of the injustice of this world. Between people, there are still masters and slaves. One side is arrogant, so arrogant that they forget themselves, and the other side is lowly, so lowly that they are invisible. Before this kidnapping, she had grown up in a family almost isolated from this world. No matter how she recalled the family's past, it was all happy and joyful memories. Now, she was just beginning to enter this world to live. She should be grateful to the person who led her into this world—Yuwen, the volunteer soldier.

If she had a good impression of Yuwen, the volunteer soldier, that good impression was influenced in this way. If she had a determination to take revenge on the enemy, that determination was made in this way. If she had a deeper yearning for the motherland, that yearning was aroused in this way. If she had a new hatred for her father, that hatred began in this way. If she had greater unease, that unease came in this way.

Indeed, she was uneasy, because her young and weak reason could not yet analyze or control the chaotic emotions stirred up by a moment.

He was afraid that she would suffer from unnecessary unease, so he was trying to persuade her:

"You should feel at ease!"

"Alas, nothing I see allows me to feel at ease!"

"You should feel at ease, as if you were at home."

"Hmph, this is not my home. Here, there is no mother or father, not a single relative!"

"Relatives are not necessarily people who love you, and we have no malice towards you. Don't you know what kind of person your father is, and what kind of people we are? You used to be a high school student, and now you are still a good youth, you should know these things! Am I not right?"

"I know what my father is... No matter what, he is still my father! Besides, he loves me very much, I know... But don't think that I am like my father! I know what kind of people you are: But how exactly will you treat me?" (57)
