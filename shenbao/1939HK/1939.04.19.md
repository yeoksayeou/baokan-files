### A Sideways View of the Sino-Japanese War: Reflections Written by Japanese Prisoner of War Kuro Morishita After Being Influenced, Translated by Wang Dajie, Director of the First Prisoner of War Camp, Ministry of Military and Political Affairs

Prisoner Kuro Morishita is 27 years old, originally from Hiroshima, Japan. He graduated from Hiroshima Ichikou High School. In 1937, he became an employee of the South Manchuria Railway and was then selected as a so-called "Officer Consolation Palace of the North China Expeditionary Army." In Yuanshi County, Hebei Province, he carried out so-called pacification work, stirring up trouble and instigating discord. In May of last year, he became the head of the pacification squad in Zanhuang County. On July 22, he went to the south of the county, only a dozen or so li from the city, and was captured by our commando unit. Even in Xule Village, he remained stubborn and unyielding, but he expressed deep gratitude for China's preferential treatment and admired the loyalty and bravery of the Chinese military and civilians. Last winter, even here, he still used his pacification skills, arguing whenever he spoke, debating more than a dozen times. When he uttered fallacies, we analyzed and refuted them with facts and truths about China and Japan, urging him to reflect and become aware. Every time he ran out of arguments, he would bow his head and ponder, as if realizing something, and then solemnly say, "Yes." One day, he said that the "New Chinese Government" was purely the will of the people and had nothing to do with Japan… I smiled and said, "Whether it is the will of the people or not, I don't know as well as you do. You think it has nothing to do with Japan, but I don't know why you need to pacify it if it is the will of the people. If it has nothing to do with Japan, why are you Japanese doing this pacification work?" At that time, he acted abnormally, clapping and laughing wildly, and then he greatly realized that this war was an "artificial organization" of Japan's aggressive policy and a despicable act of the Japanese financial clique, while China, based on the peaceful thought and humanitarian spirit of five thousand years, was fighting a just war for national survival and human happiness. He can now judge for himself who is right and who is wrong between China and Japan. In other matters, regarding the actual situation on the battlefield, the Japanese army is short of troops and is often ambushed. Our military and civilians are united and of one heart, our fighting spirit is stronger, and our combat power is greater. In reasoning and logic, final victory must belong to us. Now, I am translating Morishita Kuro's "A Sideways View of the Sino-Japanese War" and "A Letter to the Japanese People" to show a glimpse of his thoughts after being influenced.

It has been a year and a half since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. During this time, both China and Japan have spent most of their military expenses and sacrificed hundreds of thousands of heroic souls. Now, they are still shedding blood every day, and it is difficult to predict how many years this tragic war will continue.

Why has it not been possible to avoid the greatest crime of society and the hateful struggle of mankind? Moreover, the warring countries are both yellow people and East Asian nations, standing tall in the world as two major independent countries in East Asia, and both are loudly calling for true peace in the East.

Is it necessary to resolve this true East Asian peace, which both countries are loudly calling for, through struggle? I dare to say that Japan exists because of China, and Japan would not exist without China. Only by maintaining the utmost friendship between the two countries can this true peace be maintained and preserved.

If so, why was this Sino-Japanese War not resolved through diplomatic means? Now, I want to explore the reasons and express my thoughts.

According to the respective statements of China and Japan, when asked about the illegal shooting, what was the reason? They simply say that the beginning of this incident was only the Lugouqiao Incident. This kind of explanation must be said to be too hasty and too superficial.

Then, is this reason, as Japan claims, due to anti-Japanese sentiment, anti-Japanese activities, or anti-communism? This is even less likely. I would rather say that the main reason is the continental policy that the Imperial military is shouting about, in other words, the ambition of the Empire to unite Asia and be its leader.

Judging from the facts, although China advocates anti-Japanese sentiment, has it ever engaged in anti-Japanese activities? To discuss this point, we must first recall the history of the past forty years and examine it.

When China failed in the Sino-Japanese War, it lost territory and national rights. Furthermore, the general public lived under the oppression of foreign countries. In a certain sense, freedom had been bound. When the "Manchurian Incident" broke out, the lost land became even larger, and national rights were further damaged. In this situation, the feelings of the Chinese people toward Japan became increasingly worse.

However, the Chinese government must be able to grasp the people who advocate national rights equality and freedom liberation, strictly abide by the armistice agreement, and ensure its full implementation. However, Japan is not like this. It still sends troops into the country. When the Hebei-Chahar Political Council was established, it disregarded all of China's national rights and interfered in all of China's politics. Only because it had these kinds of actions did anti-Japanese sentiment and anti-Japanese activities arise. The driving force behind the expansion of the Chinese Communist Party is due to the inequality of China's national rights and the various forms of oppression it suffered.

Thus, the anti-Japanese and Communist Party claims that the Empire has been shouting about, are they ultimately from the Chinese people? No, they are not. It is no exaggeration to say that they were caused by Japan itself.

Furthermore, does the Empire's repeated statement that it "has no territorial ambitions" come from sincerity?

We can know this by looking at the current "Manchukuo."

Although there is an imperial government that determines national policy, its actual power is all placed under the influence of the Imperial government. It is called industrial development, but it is actually armed immigration, only striving to expand its own national rights and interests.

With the above facts, what is this if not a war of aggression? Today, it is making the whole of China into a second "Manchukuo." Can it be said that it has no territorial ambitions? Based on the above judgments, it is clear who is right and who is wrong in the cause of the Sino-Japanese War.

As the Sino-Japanese War progressed, the Japanese army captured Hankou, considering it the end of a stage, while China will enter its intended goal of "protracted resistance."

Since the outbreak of the incident, both countries have consistently not taken the people as enemies, but the warlords as enemies, and each wants to defeat them. Then, who are these so-called warlords? Let's first look at the Japanese warlords, who are exerting their military power, oppressing the people, and interfering in China's politics. This has given rise to a kind of demand, the self-respect of the masses. Once this heart is determined, it deceives the people, disrupts peace, and creates the contradictory phenomenon of war. Please look at the history of the rise and fall of the Japanese military. You can see that whenever the power of the military declines, it will inevitably provoke war. Even if it plunges the people into the suffering of war, it does not care at all, only seeking to expand the power and interests of the military itself, which cannot but be said to be purely for self-enrichment.

Looking back at the era of Chinese warlords, perhaps because the territory was too large, it is also unknown. In short, for decades, the entire territory had never been ruled under one ruler. Various parts of the country were divided, and warlords competed with each other, and the people were subjected to the rule of these warlords.

In contrast, the general public in the country has always loved peace, from ancient times to the present. Because of their emphasis on literature and disdain for martial arts, the warlords are often influenced by them, and their power can only be regarded as a means to maintain peace.

This is why the world calls China the "sleeping lion." First, peace, second, peace. In short, they are extremely fond of peace and fight for humanitarianism. Not only in today's troubled times, but also in the future, they will be able to base themselves on this spirit and make steady progress.

Looking at the foregoing, although the Chinese warlords were scattered in various places and not under the command of the central government, since the outbreak of this incident, the entire territory of China has been under the command of leader Chiang Kai-shek, and the people have also been running for the country under the banner of supporting Chairman Chiang and the central government, making China's five thousand years of history焕然one new, and finally forming a unified country with one government and one leader.

From this point of view, this action of Japan's is actually a lucky thing for China, in that it is reforming the evils of the past!

Next, please look at the current situation on the battle line, which has been going on for a year and a half.

Japanese newspapers publicize that since the outbreak of the incident, the "Imperial Army" has been attacking key areas in China with irresistible force, continuously conquering key areas, and using this to oppress the entire Chinese territory. Furthermore, all transportation lines in the occupied territories and their nearby key areas have been designated as Japanese military sphere of influence, responsible for their security. However, in reality, is it really as the Japanese newspapers have published? All the areas occupied by the Japanese army are within the sphere of influence of the Japanese army. Little does it know that in the current situation where the battle line is too large, the Japanese army feels that its troops are actually insufficient. It takes a lot of effort to only defend the county towns and railway lines in the occupied areas. However, China is now commanding guerrilla tactics throughout the country. Therefore, although the areas have been occupied by the Japanese army, except for the railway lines, the other vast areas are still within the sphere of influence of the Chinese army. In this current situation of protracted resistance, the Chinese army has made the Japanese army stationed in the occupied areas in a position of being attacked. Moreover, this area, which is deeply suffering from the ravages of war, is deeply troubled by the lack of means to restore law and order. The actions of the Japanese army, which is obsessed with victory, such as killing, looting, burning houses, etc., make the Chinese people witness this and are driven out of their villages, and their parents, wives, and children are scattered, causing them to have angry hearts towards Japan, thinking that if they do not further strengthen and strive for resistance, their country will inevitably perish. Therefore, the spirit of unity between the military and the civilians has indeed been produced. Unconsciously, the consciousness of resistance has become more and more intense and consolidated.

If this advantageous protracted resistance continues to unfold, then the Japanese army, which is in the opposite position, even if all the people are soldiers, and therefore this long-term war, the big mistake of the military will also be exposed, and the fact that it has deceived the people will also be exposed, and it will become the motive for the separation of the military and the civilians. The combat effectiveness of the army itself will also decline. Therefore, it can be asserted that very great difficulties will be encountered in mountain warfare and surprise attacks from then on.

Ladies and gentlemen, the current Sino-Japanese War is developing in the long term.

You who live in Japan see newspapers and hear radio broadcasts every day. All of them say that the Japanese army is conquering China with irresistible force, and the areas that have been occupied have all been taken by the Japanese army. Public security has been completely restored, and the Chinese people all respect the Japanese army and hate the former central government. The people of the newly established "New Chinese Government" are happily starting families and establishing businesses, and the Japanese army has successively conquered Nanjing, Xuzhou, Hankou, and other important cities in China. The war has already been won. Since this is the case, why does the war never end? You must have doubts and be baffled by these things!

There are many reasons for this, but the most obvious is that the Japanese news, broadcasting, magazines, and all Japanese propaganda organs are all under the control and oppression of the Japanese military. They are not allowed to publish the true situation of the incident and often use false propaganda to deceive you. Therefore, the facts published by newspapers and radio are completely different from the facts on the battlefield!

As in the above situation, you really lack knowledge of China and your knowledge is insufficient.

For example, the current Japanese government does not recognize China's central government.

However, this is only the behavior of the Japanese government. As for other foreign countries, they still recognize the former Chinese government. In addition, the "New Chinese Government" said by the Japanese military is definitely not formed by the will of the people, but is supported by the Japanese military. To put it bluntly, it is under the "control" of Japan, in other words, it is forced to organize it under the power of force.

The evidence is that wherever Japan now occupies and stations troops, there are so-called "Pacification Squads" and propaganda organs everywhere, vigorously propagating the political program and policies of the "New Chinese Government" and desperately trying to win the hearts of the Chinese people.

Think about it, if this "New Government" is indeed formed by the true will of the Chinese people, then what is the necessity of this kind of propaganda work? Moreover, in the areas occupied by the Japanese army, the public security, etc., should have been completely restored long ago. Who knows that the current battle line has spread throughout China, and the areas occupied by the Japanese army, which are said to be the sphere of influence of the Japanese army, are only the Pinghan Railway and the county towns in its vicinity, and it takes a lot of effort to defend them.

Because, except for the railway and the county towns, the other vast areas all belong to the sphere of influence of the Chinese army, and they often attack the Japanese army stationed in various places.

If this is the case, where is its driving force? This is what we must know.

This is none other than the fact that the Chinese people, from beginning to end, support the central government and take hostile actions against the Japanese army's invasion. Therefore, the so-called "New Chinese Government" is only a one-sided, false propaganda of the Japanese army and has no strength whatsoever.

Furthermore, the Chinese people themselves have their houses burned, their parents, wives, and children separated, and even not knowing each other, turning to other places. How can they respect the Japanese army?

Now, if the situation is reversed and the most hated and evil war is launched in Japan, like the phenomenon in China's territory now, what will you think!

Wouldn't there only be more resentment and hatred towards the invaders? Even with the common sense of ordinary people, the facts listed above can be judged!

Now it has entered the stage of protracted resistance.

However, this is not something that Japan can decide, but it is actually because the Chinese government's war strategy is like this, and it is actually because the general will of the Chinese people is like this that this protracted resistance has been created.

However, China has regarded peace as the foundation of the country for five thousand years. It has been consistent to this day. Therefore, this incident was not what China wanted, nor was it initiated by China. It was only a desperate response to the invaders. Moreover, China's enemies are definitely not the innocent you - the Japanese people - but the destroyers of society and mankind - the Japanese warlords - and the backstage bosses who support the warlords - the Japanese chaebols.

If this hateful struggle continues in the long term, will you be happy?

You should not shout "Victory" or "Victory". You should think about this incident truthfully and criticize it carefully.

What is left as a result of the struggle that injures hundreds of thousands of good people and increases national debts by several billion? Besides the separation of parents, the death of children, and the displacement of wives on the road, what other benefits are there?

Then look at the war situation in China.

Although there are traces of battlefields in ancient and modern times, east and west, do you think it is good for this to happen in the "Showa civilization" era?

Making the fields left by our ancestors barren, and tens of thousands of fortunes turned to ashes in one morning, such as houses being burned, nothing left, and parents, wives, and children dying, is it something that should exist in society and humanity? Is it a way to go in life?

If you imagine such tragic facts after the war, who can not oppose this most hateful war right now?

China now, with the military and civilians united, even if the whole country is scorched earth, will certainly defeat the Japanese warlords, but will work together with the innocent you - the Japanese people - to build a truly peaceful East for the future! In short, China will not stop resisting as long as Japan does not stop its aggression in this incident! Not only that, but the Chinese people will only increase and consolidate their awareness of resistance.

Thinking in this way, the Japanese Empire, which has dominated the world for 2,600 years, may also follow in the footsteps of Napoleon, who conquered the entire European continent and was invincible.

The victory or defeat of a war does not depend on military force, and its final victory lies in the will of the people.

Thinking of the inside of the war, there are many crying people. Is there anyone who is not moved by the love of mankind?

In short, unless the Japanese military reflects and becomes aware, there is no other way.

The above is one aspect of my personal thoughts on this incident, and I respectfully inform you of it.

In addition, regarding the true situation on the battlefield, even if you use your common sense of being old in politics, there are many things that you cannot imagine. Therefore, compatriots must not be deceived by the propaganda of newspapers, magazines, and movies, etc. Each of you should do your best to be sincere, criticize this incident thoroughly, and then determine a way to deal with yourself!

Editorial

### Congratulating the National Christian University Education Conference

The National Christian University Education Conference began in Hong Kong the day before yesterday. Attendees from Beijing, St. John's, Soochow, Shanghai, Zhijiang, Union, South China Women's College of Arts and Sciences, Lingnan, Cheeloo, Ginling, Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences, and West China Union University attended. Since the War of Resistance, national Christian universities have either been bombed by aircraft, their campuses destroyed; or ravaged by the army, unable to carry out educational affairs; however, the university authorities have been able to maintain the sacred cause of university education amidst hardship and danger. Some are still supporting it hard in the occupied areas, such as Yenching University in Beiping; others have selected safe areas to continue running, such as Ginling, Ginling Women's College of Arts and Sciences, Cheeloo, and West China Union University. This spirit of not fearing all hardships and striving to cultivate national talents by the authorities of Christian universities is not only the glory of Christianity, but also deserves the respect of the entire Chinese nation.

Now that the National Christian Universities are holding an education conference in Hong Kong, its most important task is of course to review the current situation of Christian university education across the country, refer to the resolutions and declarations of my country's recent Third National Education Conference, and study the future direction and methods of maintaining and improving education, and solving the various difficult problems currently encountered by Christian university education. We, in view of the important position of Christian universities in national university education, and the serious difficulties currently encountered by Christian universities, in addition to warmly wishing the principals and professors attending this meeting to achieve satisfactory results, would like to offer our humble advice as the responsibility of the media for reference:

First of all, we hope that the National Christian University Conference will be able to grasp the central issue of current education when discussing the agenda, that is, to take the great spirit of sacrifice and salvation of Christ, who does not compromise and does not succumb, and to take the responsibility of cultivating talents to save the country and build the country with full enthusiasm and sincerity. Dr. Miao Qiusheng, who attended this meeting, stated the day before yesterday that the educational policy of Christianity lies in "educational freedom." He also said: "If education can be carried out in accordance with the educational policy set by the central government, it will continue," This policy and determination are most admirable. Chairman Chiang, a Christian believer, recently declared to the Third National Education Conference: "We must take the Three People's Principles of revolutionary salvation as the highest standard of education in our country, implement the program of resisting Japan and building the country, and create the rebirth of a modern country. The new force of a modern country is composed of three elements: education, economy, and military force. Education is the foundation of all undertakings." He also said, "We must create a modern country in China that is rich in vitality and has a promising future in the midst of various hardships and difficulties." We hope that this conference will never forget these teachings and seek to implement them thoroughly.

Secondly, what we are most concerned about is the educational cause in the areas occupied by the [Japanese] invaders, the rear areas of the [Japanese] and the war zones. Because there, we still have countless young people who demand normal national education, while the [Japanese] are pushing forward the work of enslavement by all kinds of blasphemous education. This is the most tragic situation in the world! We can only hope that our Christian educators will display a spirit of great fearlessness and make greater efforts and struggles to, on the one hand, establish contact with all educators engaged in national salvation and reconstruction in the war zone and the rear, and on the other hand, make tenacious and ingenious struggles against the violent orders and threats of all puppet regimes. Dr. Miao Qiusheng, who attended this meeting, stated: The future education policy of Christianity should also "ensure the lives of teachers and students." This determination not to fear the strong and to maintain the dignity and safety of education is most admirable. We further hope that this conference will decide on more concrete and effective methods to preserve the vitality of our country and nation and cultivate true defenders of truth for society and mankind.

In addition, there are two points that we warmly hope for at the National Christian University Education Conference: first, under the current situation of national peril and educational difficulties, we must do more and greater efforts for education and culture: such as adapting to all current needs, referring to the actual situation in various places, leading students, expanding library equipment, promoting mass education, adding wartime lectures, training technical talents for resisting Japan and building the country, striving for various wartime service work, and sincerely promoting the National Spiritual Mobilization, assisting the national salvation movement of young students in various places, etc. The second is to closely link with the Christian education community abroad, publicize the [Japanese] atrocities of Japan's invasion of China and the situation of the youth in China's education sector fighting bloody battles for human justice and peace, and obtain greater sympathy and assistance from the international community in terms of morality and material.

During this period of the War of Resistance, when the country's survival is at stake, we have a greater sense of riding in the same boat in the face of the storms with the university principals and professors attending this meeting! The universities that you preside over, in the war zones, in the occupied areas, and in the distant rear areas, have already achieved hard work in the past, and the situation in the future may not be improved, and the responsibility will be even greater. In addition to gratitude and expectation, we can only pray that you will uphold the great spirit of Christ, not value the current reward, but look forward to the spiritual comfort that will be given to you after the success of the War of Resistance and national construction of the Chinese nation and the realization of world peace! We hereby congratulate you on your health, and we hereby congratulate the National Christian University Education Conference on its success!

### Our Country's Future War of Resistance Occupies an Absolute Advantage; The [Japanese]'s Resources are Exhausted and their Combat Power is Weakening; The Attack on Changsha Will Become a Lasting Reflection; An Important Report by Our Military Commission

(Chongqing, Central News Agency, 18th) Our army recently abandoned Nanchang. The domestic and foreign countries are paying close attention to the future war situation, especially the attempt of the [Japanese] army to invade Changsha, which is of great concern to all parties. Moreover, if the [Japanese] army once occupied Changsha, it would be able to achieve its goal of controlling the western provinces of China, thereby seeking resources to reduce the burden of its own military vehicles. A reporter from this agency recently visited the spokesperson of the Military Commission to inquire about everything, and was honored to have the following remarks: On the surface, the [Japanese] army has occupied Nanchang, and our Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been cut off, making transportation more difficult. It will naturally have a considerable impact on the future war situation. However, a closer examination of the content shows that our army's resolute abandonment of Nanchang this time will not only have no impact on the future war situation, but will actually be beneficial to us. First,

In terms of military affairs

In this battle in northern Jiangxi, after bloody battles for several weeks, our army has completely completed the task of attrition due to proper use and the willingness of officers and soldiers to die as if going home. The main force of the [Japanese] Central China Expeditionary Army has suffered more than 30,000 casualties, and the deaths of regimental commanders, battalion commanders, and other important officers are numerous. Its combat strength has been greatly weakened, and the main purpose of our army's operation is to use the mountains to lure the [Japanese] army deep, and wait until the majority of the [Japanese] army's main force is attracted to a suitable area, and then the various mechanical weapons of the [Japanese] army will lose their effectiveness. Then, we can give full play to the advantages of our army and give the [Japanese] army a fatal blow, causing them to lose their combat capabilities. It is not about the gains and losses of a city or a place. The [Japanese] army's invasion of northern Jiangxi this time, sacrificing so much, is precisely for this reason. Therefore, it is also a necessary measure for our army to abandon Nanchang and transfer the main force to a favorable position. In the future, the more the [Japanese] army goes, the deeper it will sink. If it takes the risky action of invading Changsha, then the degree of its sacrifice will inevitably be even greater. There is no doubt about it. This is one thing. (See lower half of the page)

### Intense Fighting on the Western Front: Enemy Momentum in Northwestern Shanxi Largely Thwarted; Enemy in Eastern Shanxi Invades Southward in Three Routes

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 18th] Shaanxi and Shanxi troops of our army are still attacking Yicheng, Wenxi, and Jiangxian. About 5,000 enemy troops from Pingyao, Taigu, and Yuci in Eastern Shanxi launched a three-pronged southward invasion yesterday, with each contingent consisting of over 1,000 men. Fierce battles are currently underway in Nancang, south of Pingyao; Malingguan, south of Taigu; and Fenshuling, Xing County, with numerous enemy casualties.

[Telegram from the Minkuo News Agency, Xixian, 18th] A certain unit of our forces, disguised as the enemy, launched a night attack and entered the city of Lingshi, killing the puppet county magistrate on the spot.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Xingji, 17th] The enemy forces in Northwestern Shanxi have suffered a significant setback in momentum following our day and night counter-attacks. The majority of the enemy troops in Wuzhai have fled to Shenchi, and the remaining remnants will soon be eliminated. In the areas of Lishi, Zhongyang, and Jinluozhen, the stalemate continues, but the enemy's offensive has weakened, engaging only in small-scale harassment, resulting in no major engagements.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 17th] Our attacking forces in Southern Shanxi are currently pressing towards major strongholds in Anyi, Yuncheng, Jiexian, and Yicheng. The enemy is visibly struggling to cope with the situation. The battles in the suburbs of various cities have been exceptionally fierce in recent days.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Xingji, 17th] Our forces counter-attacking the east side of the Tongpu Railway in the Yellow River Delta have made smooth progress after days of hard fighting. We have successively captured Yangshe, Podi, Chejiahe, and Guo Niu southeast of Wenxi, leaving behind hundreds of enemy corpses. Furthermore, a certain unit is besieging Zhangdian (southeast of Anyi) and Ershiling (near Jiexian) with fierce attacks for days. The enemy's momentum has waned. Troops attacking Jiexian are currently engaged in fierce fighting near the city, with some units advancing to Yu Xiang Qing Hua Town, cutting off enemy communications. Remnant enemy forces near Xiaxian are being routed by our women's squads. Over 1,000 enemy reinforcements from Anyi and Yuncheng were intercepted by our forces, resulting in hundreds of casualties. On the Yicheng front, we have cut off the enemy's rear route at Henglingguan. The west gate and southern suburbs of Yicheng, including Shicun, have been occupied by us. The enemy is still stubbornly resisting within the city and has sent 2,000 reinforcements from Quwo to operate eastward.

### Puppet Troops in Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia Defect En Masse

[Telegram from the Minkuo News Agency, Hequ, 18th] A certain detachment of a certain army of our forces advancing to the Northwest Frontier, along with the Ethnic Revolutionary Wartime Mobilization Committee of the Second War Zone and the Chahar-Suiyuan Border Region Working Committee, arrived in Suiyuan last year. Behind enemy lines, they mobilized the masses to establish guerrilla bases in the Daqing Mountains, thwarting numerous enemy "mopping-up" operations. Recently, due to our army's proactive actions and widespread propaganda, a wave of defections has been triggered among various puppet army units. On April 1st, the puppet Taolin County Security Team, unable to endure the oppression and bullying of the Japanese, staged a defection late at night, killing dozens of enemy soldiers and wounding several others. The entire unit then marched out of the city, raised the banner of righteousness, and sent a telegram to the nation declaring their opposition to the puppet regime, vowing to fight to the end under the leadership of Chairman Jiang to overthrow Japanese fascism and establish a new, independent, free, and happy democratic republic of China.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Wuyuan, 16th] Over 550 men from the puppet 7th Division, led by Division Commander Liu Fuxi, Yang Zhanshan, and Liu Chongtu, defected on the 11th in Taolin County, eastern Suiyuan. Several enemy officers were shot on the spot. We have already dispatched personnel to reorganize them and appointed Zhao Dayi as commander of the guerrilla detachment. Zhao is currently leading his troops to attack the enemy in Fengzhen.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Luoyang, 17th] Yang Fengcai, the commander of the pistol battalion under the puppet Che Liying, possesses patriotic sentiments and hates Li's unlawful actions. He has now led all 500 of his officers and soldiers in a defection, with all their weapons intact. They have arrived near the Wei River and surrendered to a certain unit of our forces for acceptance.

### Our Nation Purchases 2,000 Vehicles from America

[Report from This Port] A certain Mr. He, a key member of the Fuxing Corporation, was recently ordered by the company to go to Rangoon to receive the transportation vehicles purchased with a large loan recently secured from the United States. It is reported that a total of 2,000 vehicles were purchased with the loan, to be delivered in approximately three or four batches. At the latest, delivery will be completed by November of this year. The first batch of over 140 vehicles has already arrived in Rangoon. Mr. He and others will go to Rangoon to take delivery of this batch of vehicles and hand them over to the Southwest Transportation Company for use. Of these 2,000 vehicles, 1,000 will be fully handed over to the Southwest Transportation Company to meet current needs, while the other 1,000 will be handed over to our country's Trade Adjustment Committee. Their purpose is to transport tung oil and other major export goods from our country.

### English and American Newspapers in Shanghai Receive Threats

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] According to a Shanghai dispatch, four English-owned newspapers and two American-owned newspapers in Shanghai, which have consistently adopted an opposition stance towards Japan, all received threatening letters today signed by the "China Youth Salvation Society." The letters stated that if the newspapers did not adopt a "fair" attitude, the society would use bombs and pistols against them. The assassination of a Mr. Cao, a distributor for the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury last night, was also believed to have been carried out by the same terrorist elements. Currently, authorities in the Public Concession and the French Concession are providing close protection to the newspapers while actively investigating the matter. It is undoubtedly believed that the so-called "China Youth Salvation Society" is a pro-Japanese terrorist organization.

### British Concession in Tianjin Cracks Enemy Agency; Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury Distribution Chief Cao Guodong Assassinated

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Tianjin reports that an enemy agency established in the Tianjin British Concession has been cracked by British authorities. Five pistols were seized. After Xi Geng was assassinated at the Grand Theater, the British Concession began searching the concession. On the 13th, an individual claiming to be Commander Zhu was arrested in Yongshan Lane, No. 61. He is believed to be an agent of the enemy tasked with disrupting the concession. Three of his accomplices and five pistols were also taken to the Municipal Council for questioning. This incident proves the previous rumors of enemy agents establishing agencies in the concession to plot mischief were not false.

[Reuters Dispatch from Shanghai, 17th] Cao Guodong, the 43-year-old distribution chief of the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, was shot and killed tonight. The assassins escaped in a car. A stray bullet injured a woman. It is rumored that the incident has political motives.

### Petty Traitor Wang Xianmin Assassinated in Shanghai

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Wang Xianmin (transliteration), a low-ranking official in the Nanjing "Reformed Government," was assassinated last night in the French Concession of Shanghai. His body was found in the chapel of a certain theater, riddled with knife wounds and bullet holes. A note was attached to his clothing, stating that Wang was a traitor and signed with the words "Traitor Elimination Corps."

### National Government Orders

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] The National Government issued the following orders on the 17th:

### Solemn Statement from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: Basic Policies of the Communist Party; Close Cooperation Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party; Unite with Britain, America, France, and the Soviet Union; Expose the Japanese Conspiracy to Fabricate Documents

[Reuters Dispatch from Chongqing, 18th] The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party today issued a statement to Reuters, declaring that neither the headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party nor its branches have been involved in any of the propaganda pamphlets recently circulating in Shanghai. These propaganda pamphlets criticize the attitudes of Britain and France towards China and advocate for the establishment of an anti-British and anti-French front, otherwise the Communist Party should split with the Kuomintang. The statement denounces this as "absurd and ridiculous," stating that its content is completely inconsistent with the Chinese Communist Party's policy of "establishing a united front to resist Japan." The statement says that the basic policies of the Chinese Communist Party are: "First, to establish cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to expel the Japanese from China and rebuild a new China that is independent, free, and happy. Second, to seek cooperation from countries around the world that sympathize with China, especially Britain, France, America, and the Soviet Union." The statement continues, "The content of these propaganda pamphlets is clearly contrary to the views of the Chinese Communist Party and aims to disrupt the friendly relations between Britain and France and China's resistance. We believe that the British and French governments are fully aware of this. At the same time, the scheme to divide the Chinese people internally in order to create animosity between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has completely failed."

### Chairman Chiang's Speech Clarifies the Path to Victory

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] After the weekly memorial service on the 17th, several Chinese and foreign journalists asked Chairman Chiang the following questions. The following is a record of his answers: (Reporter asked) "There are still people who say that Konoe's statement on 'Establishing a New Order in East Asia' can be used as a basis for peace between China and Japan, and do not recognize it as a condition for national subjugation. What should be done with this?" (Chairman Chiang replied) "'Establishing a New Order in East Asia' is just a new term for Japan's annexation of China. In my speech on December 26th of last year, I already analyzed in detail Japan's ambition to invade China. There is no need to say more. If we use Konoe's statement and interpret the word 'peace' as acceptable conditions, then the dictionary would no longer need the word 'surrender.' This is an extremely shameless joke. Not only will this not happen today, but it will never happen. The purpose of China's resistance is to defend the survival, independence, and freedom of the entire nation. Our struggle will not stop until this goal is achieved. Now, the longer the war drags on, the more Japan's weaknesses are exposed, and its ambitions become even more apparent. This is the so-called 'the dagger is revealed when the map is unrolled' principle. With the actions of the Japanese militarists, anyone can see that they are trying to seize the lives of our entire nation and make us their slaves forever. Konoe's so-called 'Establishing a New Order in East Asia' is Japan's sinister plan to dominate East Asia, not only to eliminate China, but also to eliminate all the power of all countries in the Pacific. Japan's desire for aggression is advancing with the times, and China's understanding of the progress of Japan's ambitions is becoming clearer. Therefore, our will to resist is becoming even stronger. Under these circumstances, there is absolutely no room for peace, and we will absolutely not be shaken by any clever, hypocritical surrender theories. This is the determination of our entire country. As for those who advocate this extremely shameless view, I believe that the power of moral and conscientious sanctions, according to our Chinese principles, is greater than the power of legal sanctions. Such people have already declared their own death sentence in spirit, and they are really not worth mentioning. As for the state's punishment, it will depend on their future actions." (Question) "How can the Sino-Japanese War ultimately be resolved?" (Answer) "This question depends on how the facts evolve in the future. We have only been resisting for 22 months, not even two years, and Japan's international status as a first-class country has already been reduced to a second-class country by our resistance. If we continue to intensify our resistance, based on the facts of the past, I believe that in the near future, it will inevitably make it impossible for him to maintain his current status as a second-class country. In this way, on the one hand, his national power will be more exhausted and his status will be lower, and on the other hand, we must strengthen our own strength, reach a favorable time and a favorable position, and give him a fatal blow? Only by making him truly recognize the power of China's resistance can there be hope for peace. I believe that this is not only possible, but as long as we work hard, this period will surely come soon. In addition to this, if we want to restore peace between China and Japan, then unless the Japanese militarists have a thorough awakening and automatically abandon their aggression, their traditional policies must be fundamentally changed. If they do not fundamentally abandon their policy of aggression..." (To be continued)

### China Will Occupy an Absolutely Advantageous Position in the War of Resistance in the Future

(Continued from the first question on this page) Second,

Politically speaking, since the enemy invaded and occupied Wuhan, it has inadvertently fallen into the trap we set. The enemy's manpower and resources have reached a point that is not permitted by its national policy. Therefore, after the Battle of Wuhan's periphery came to an end, the enemy's military actions fell into a state of inability to advance further. They then issued a so-called defense statement, using the guise of peace to try to shake our country's national policy of resistance. However, the anti-war sentiment among the enemy's front-line soldiers is raging like a wildfire. The internal popular anger and the front-line morale decline have both reached an extreme. Now, the launch of the Battle of Northern Jiangxi is only an attempt to divert the attention of its people. However, with such a high price, the morale of the people and soldiers will be disturbed, and future combat will become increasingly difficult. If they invade Changsha to the west, the price they pay will be even more incalculable. This is the second point. Third,

Economically speaking, the enemy has spent over 10 trillion on this war of aggression against China. The total amount of public debt has reached 16 trillion, most of which is a deficit. It is now estimated that an average of about 140 million is needed every day. Even if the enemy were to scrape everything clean, it would be powerless. The attempt to plunder financial resources in China is very active. However, in the occupied areas, there are our guerrilla armies, cooperating with civilian armed forces, constantly giving them strong blows, making them unable to sleep peacefully. After occupying Nanchang, they turned their forces west to Changsha. Even if our Zhejiang-Jiangxi and even Hunan-Jiangxi communications are completely cut off, the center of gravity of our external transportation is not on the southeast coast. What is imported from the southeast coast is only a part of luxury goods that consume money. If the import route of these luxury goods is interrupted in the future, in addition to saving a lot of financial and national strength invisibly, we can concentrate all our efforts on other transportation routes. The adjustment of the import and export of various important materials is actually beneficial to us. The enemy's attempt to plunder our resources has not yet been realized, and it is even more impossible to control our western provinces. From any point of view, military, political, or economic, the enemy's invasion of Nanchang and even the westward invasion of Changsha only proves its last flash of glory. The period of its total collapse must not be far away. And we are fighting for the independence and survival of the country and the nation, and for human justice and righteousness. Our manpower and financial resources are inexhaustible, and we can become stronger and more courageous as we fight. Obvious victory must belong to us. Therefore the situation between us and the enemy after the abandonment of Nanchang is actually very clear.

### Our Guerrillas Are Active in Jilin

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] According to Japanese sources from Tokyo, guerrillas in Jilin Province are again active. Last Friday, 200 guerrillas attacked Dapu Jiahe Village (transliteration), near a Japanese reclamation area, burned down the village chief's office, and then retreated.

### Hunan and Hubei Enemy Extremely Uneasy; Fierce Fighting Near Guangzhou; Our Army in Shandong and Henan Very Active; No Change in the Battle Situation in Northern Jiangxi

[Telegram from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 18th] Telegram from Guilin: Fierce fighting is taking place near Guangzhou between our forces and the enemy. The enemy is sending reinforcements to advance towards Yuantan and Conghua in an attempt to relieve the threat to Guangzhou. Fierce battles are currently underway in the Dabaishan and Dawoshan areas.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 18th] The enemy is attempting to concentrate its forces to launch another fierce attack on us. We are closely monitoring and preparing to strike hard. There were no changes on the Jiangxi front on the 17th. There were local battles in western Gao'an and western Wuning. In Zengcheng, southern Guangdong, we are continuing to eliminate the remnant enemy forces. On the 16th, a certain unit of our forces attacked Baiyun Mountain near Guangzhou and then an airfield, destroying a large number of enemy aircraft.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 18th] Zhongxiang, Hubei, is still under our encirclement and control.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 17th] According to reports, the enemy in Shandong is actually collecting land taxes at a rate of 3.5 yuan per mu. A certain unit of our forces attacked Zhudao in Weihai City, burned its barracks, and killed many enemy soldiers. We repeatedly attacked the various stations in Dakou and Tai'an, destroying all the bridges. The Jinpu Railway is impassable.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 17th] According to reports, in eastern Henan, we have occupied the line of Xiaochengji, Chicang, and Shizhai near Tongxu. A part of the enemy is still unresolved in Tongxu City. The enemy in Bianchen is sending reinforcements in two directions and is engaged in fierce fighting in Xiaochengji, Chicang, and Shizhai. We killed more than 200 enemy soldiers. A certain regiment of our forces attacked the newly built Bian-Xin Railway and Mazhuang Station, killing more than 100 enemy soldiers and capturing 88 employees. There were many Japanese flags and documents.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Xuan Chang, 17th] A certain unit of our forces, using mobile and clever tactics the day before yesterday, suddenly launched a fierce attack on Tianmen. The enemy San Tian Regiment, entrenched in Tian Dou, fought fiercely with us in the suburbs. Our army bravely attacked, and the enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties. Regiment Commander San Tian Xiteng was killed on the spot. The enemy's morale suddenly plummeted, and they fled into the city and were trapped. We are currently fiercely besieging.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Xiushui, 18th] In the past ten days, our artillery unit has sunk a total of four enemy transport ships fully loaded with enemy soldiers and ammunition on the river between Wuxue and Yangxin. The enemy is deeply disturbed by our guerrillas' constant sabotage of communications and has specially transferred 2,000 troops from Hankou to Wuchang to guard the northern section of the Yuehan Railway and the Hunan-Hubei Highway.

### Counter-Attacks on All Fronts Progressing Smoothly; Various Circles in Shanghai Send Telegram to Chairman Chiang to Pay Respects

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] A Shanghai dispatch states that various groups in Shanghai, encouraged by the recent frequent reports of victories in our army's counter-attacks on all fronts, have sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang to pay their respects. The original telegram reads: "To Chairman Chiang and all officers and soldiers on all fronts: Twenty-one months have passed since the July 7th Incident. Although the enemy has launched a fierce attack on us with the troops of the entire country and with sharp weapons, thanks to your wise decisions and command, and the brave and dedicated efforts of all the officers and soldiers, the enemy has suffered a heavy blow. Recently, you launched a counter-attack on all fronts, progressing smoothly and with great momentum, posing a more serious threat to the enemy. The good news has spread, and we are deeply encouraged. We send our sincere regards and hope that you will continue to make efforts to annihilate the ugly enemy, restore our homeland. Although the people in the isolated island have a harsh environment, they are firmly committed to resisting the war and will make their best efforts to strive for the final victory and complete the great cause of national reconstruction. We respectfully offer our sincere blood and respectfully ask for your acceptance. The various groups in Shanghai kowtow."

### Mobilizing the Strength of the Entire Nation: President Chiang's Broadcast Address Exposes the Great Significance of Spiritual Mobilization; Full Implementation Must Begin on the First of Next Month

(Continued from the Third Page of Yesterday's Newspaper) Secondly, we must ask ourselves, since the War of Resistance, has there been positive development and progress in our spirit? Are there still many shortcomings? Speaking of this, I want to remind our compatriots of something I said more than a year ago. This was when the War of Resistance had only been going on for two or three months. At that time, foreign opinions of our country varied, but one particularly shocking comment was: "China is not strong enough, either spiritually or materially, to resist foreign forces." I wonder if our compatriots still remember this sentence. I, personally, keep this sentence in mind every day, using it to warn and encourage myself, never forgetting it for a moment. This sentence is a kind of insult to us, which must be proven wrong by facts in the future. Of course, we have already shown many heroic and courageous deeds during the War of Resistance, but compatriots must remember that the war is not over yet, the Japanese invaders have not been driven out, and final victory has not yet been achieved. We must frankly and earnestly examine ourselves. Has the spirit of our people really progressed along with the progress of the war? Have our past shortcomings been completely washed away during the War of Resistance? Have those of us with responsibilities fulfilled our responsibilities? Have those of us with abilities used our abilities to the fullest? Has everyone's life become consistently serious and tense? Have we in the front and in the rear truly achieved a unified response and shared weal and woe? Are our thoughts, words, and actions completely focused on the goals of "nation above all, people above all, military first, and victory first"? Have we achieved consistency between words and actions in everything we say and do? Can everyone maintain the same generous and enthusiastic spirit of resistance from beginning to end, regardless of danger or safety? Can we be absolutely unwavering, unyielding, honest, and truthful? Furthermore, can our confidence in the War of Resistance and national reconstruction be accepted and understood by every citizen? Can we make the Japanese invaders and the puppet traitors recognize the invincible strength of our national spirit? Has the lifestyle of our society generally met the conditions of wartime life? I know that conscientious compatriots, if they think about themselves and look at the society around them, will definitely feel that we need to be more vigilant, more energetic, and more mutually reflective and encouraging. If a country has material deficiencies and cannot fill them in a short time, it should not be a shame for the country; because material production requires manpower, material resources, and especially the various conditions of time, which cannot be supplemented in a short time. However, spiritual deficiencies are different! With spirit, one part of material can be used as ten parts of material; and it can create a large amount of material; without spirit, as Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "the human body becomes a dead thing," no matter how many weapons and materials you have, they are all useless! Moreover, spirit is different from material. Spirit is inherent in every citizen. It is not external and can be improved and enhanced by inspiration and in the transfer of a single thought. If a country suffers foreign aggression due to spiritual decline, it is already an unparalleled shame for this generation of citizens. If, at a time of crisis and survival, we still cannot concentrate our spirit, inform every household, and encourage each other to defend our nation and overcome the current difficulties, and create a future destiny, then it is not only a shame for this generation of citizens, but simply a crime! Because this is "not that we cannot do it, but that we do not do it," and there is no reason to forgive ourselves! You must know that if we win the War of Resistance and succeed in national reconstruction, the fate of the Chinese nation for thousands of years will not be interrupted; we will also be confident that we can build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. On the other hand, if the country loses its independence and survival because our generation lacks a vigorous and unyielding spirit, then future historians will not know how severely they will criticize this period of history! Our general citizens will certainly be blamed for generations, and leaders and intellectuals from all walks of life with higher knowledge, ability, and status will be even less able to escape the blame of historians! Now the War of Resistance has entered the second stage. This is our last chance for victory, and it is also our last chance for the people to serve the country and redeem themselves. That is why, in the midst of extremely busy military and political affairs, I am advocating a general mobilization of the national spirit, which is to give our compatriots, especially leaders from all walks of life, a final opportunity to serve the country. The items included in the general mobilization of the spirit have already been listed in the outline, and there are also items that are not listed in the outline, which everyone can infer by analogy. In order to promote this mobilization universally, the method of holding national monthly meetings and swearing national covenants is first established. When everyone holds these meetings, they must not do it perfunctorily. You must know that these simple eleven articles are our weapons for resisting the Japanese invaders. We must carry them out with a spirit of not fearing death, not fearing hardship, and not fearing difficulty. For example, we say that we will not work for the Japanese invaders and traitors. If we encounter any forced coercion, we will only fight to the death and refuse to swear. For example, we say that we will not violate the Three Principles of the People and will not violate the interests of the nation and the people. If there is any external coercion or temptation to violate the Three Principles of the People and do something that violates the interests of the nation and the people, we should also grit our teeth and rather die than break our oath. We will endure any pain and refuse to break our oath. Our current situation shows that we have already entered the glorious line of turning over, and every citizen must regard himself as standing on the line of certain death, just as the ancients said, "Keep death in mind at all times, and seek life in every action." Every move we make, every drop of sweat, and every drop of blood must be used to seek the glorious and independent survival of the country and the nation. But what do we rely on to fight? It is our personal determination to die. If everyone has a determination to die at any time, the Japanese invaders will undoubtedly collapse in front of us, and the noble spirit of the Chinese nation can be universally developed to achieve the certain victory of the War of Resistance and the certain success of national reconstruction! Regarding the essence of the general mobilization of the spirit, what I want to say is really endless for a while. The oath mentioned above is the essence of the matter. I earnestly request every one of our compatriots to abide by the common goals of "nation above all, people above all, military first, victory first, concentration of will, and concentration of strength," earnestly restore our nation's inherent morality, strengthen our spiritual fortress, and dedicate our thoughts to the country. To be filial to the nation, to be benevolent to suffering compatriots, to be trustworthy in all people and things, and to exert all our strength. In this chaotic and dim world, we seek true and lasting peace. I urge our compatriots to understand that the War of Resistance is a great responsibility for national reconstruction, and we must complete it together. Therefore, we must deeply regret the mistakes of the past in not truly believing in the Three Principles of the People. From now on, we must establish our belief in national reconstruction based on the Three Principles of the People, and fulfill our promises and seek its realization. The most basic point is that our compatriots, from the old to the young, must have a passionate confidence in the bright future of the nation. We must confirm that the Republic of China based on the Three Principles of the People, which will be established after the victory of the War of Resistance, will be a new country that surpasses others, a truly people-owned, people-governed, and people-enjoyed country, and the most thorough and progressive country that can contribute to the welfare of the world. Now is a critical period of the War of Resistance, and we cannot afford to engage in any empty talk or fantasies, nor can we waste a moment of time or energy. We should face the current powerful enemy, face the country's difficulties and seriousness, reflect on our responsibilities, and earnestly examine all our shortcomings and weaknesses; on the one hand, we should quickly and effectively transform ourselves, set an example, and constantly remind our compatriots throughout the country, help our compatriots who have not yet woken up, and awaken our general compatriots with lower levels of knowledge. Let us rise up together, correct our decadent and self-destructive lives, develop a vigorous and progressive spirit, eliminate the habits of surviving by chance and being insincere, break the attempts of selfishness and surrender, correct the divergent and misleading thoughts that harm the country and ourselves, tighten our emotions, and unify our actions, so that the spirit of our Chinese nation can be enriched and concentrated, and truly achieve a general mobilization of the national spirit, and develop a spirit of great strength and integrity to complete our mission of connecting the past and opening up the future. My dear compatriots, I hope everyone will fight for the country and cherish themselves for the country. Goodbye!

Also, the China Incident has now evolved into a large-scale war, so it is necessary to fully implement the National Mobilization Law.

### The United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union Are About to Conclude an Agreement; Anglo-Soviet Negotiations Are Nearing Completion; Poland Is Discussing the Defense of Eastern Europe

[Associated Press, Paris, 18th] French authorities have recently announced that the United Kingdom and France have reached an agreement with the Soviet Union that, in the event of new aggression in Europe, Soviet air force assistance will be invoked.

[Reuters, Paris, 17th] A certain political commentator recently published an article in "Radical Newspaper," saying that it is expected that after April 18, Paris and London can announce guarantees to Poland, Romania, Greece, and Turkey, including Turkey. In addition, an agreement will be concluded with the Soviet Union to complete this guarantee system. The agreement can be formally announced within this week.

[Associated Press, London, 18th] The British House of Commons will reopen at 2:45 PM today after the Easter recess. At that time, Prime Minister Chamberlain will talk about the latest news. It is expected that the audience will be disappointed because the Prime Minister does not have specific reports. Also, the Prime Minister does not intend to publish any formal reports, but will answer questions from all parties during the question time, and announce that the United Kingdom accepts President Roosevelt's suggestion that the Anglo-Soviet and Anglo-Turkish negotiations are in progress, and the latter is nearing completion.

[Reuters, London, 18th] The Soviet Ambassador here has recently been recalled to his country. This morning he left by plane to report to his government on the negotiations with the British government. British Prime Minister Chamberlain met with Foreign Secretary Halifax today, and Army Minister Hore-Belisha also visited the Prime Minister. Also, the Turkish Ambassador visited the British Foreign Office today.

[Associated Press, London, 17th] The Soviet Ambassador visited the British Foreign Office today, but did not meet with Foreign Secretary Halifax, and only held general consultations with ordinary staff. Officials here said that the news that the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union have established air force and arms supply agreements is inaccurate.

[Associated Press, London, 17th] It is announced here that the Soviet Ambassador will return to his country on Tuesday to participate in the talks between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union in Moscow. Officials said that this talk has now progressed to an important stage, so the Soviet Ambassador can rush back to Moscow to participate.

[Reuters, Paris, 17th] Well-informed sources say that Romania has agreed to accept Soviet assistance when necessary. The Soviet Union will not only sign an air force agreement with Romania, but can also send troops through Romanian territory.

[Reuters, Paris, 17th] When the authorities discussed the progress of the Eastern European defense system negotiations in Poland and Romania, they said, "The situation is very good," but the negotiations have not yet ended, so it is considered premature to make declarations about such circumstances.

[Reuters, Paris, 17th] The cabinet meeting or state council is now scheduled to be held on April 18 to discuss the international situation, which will be chaired by President Lebrun.

### Germany Is Negotiating a Response to the United States; Rumors Say It Will Make Counter-Demands; Göring Returns Home with the Italian Reply for Discussion; Hull Discusses the Magnificent Effects of Roosevelt's Contribution

[Reuters, Berlin, 17th] The impression in political circles here is that Hitler will make counter-demands to Roosevelt in his reply to the US President's speech in the German parliament on April 28. Observers here do not expect Hitler to make a completely negative reply. What counter-demands Hitler is about to make is still difficult to predict, but according to opinions here, the content is nothing more than wanting countries to provide peace guarantees, and must first consider agreeing to what Germany considers legitimate demands. So-called legitimate demands include the settlement of colonies and Germany's economic actions in the Balkans, gaining freedom and being free from accusations.

[Reuters, Rome, 17th] When this question is asked of the German and Italian telegrams replying to President Roosevelt, they will make a positive refusal to his main suggestions. The main suggestion is that no country will be invaded within ten years, and that an international conference will be held. The Italian reply will strongly state that what Italy values is nothing more than peace, but the two actions in Abyssinia and Albania are due to the national conditions of those two countries, which actually endanger world peace, so this is done. Regarding the point of convening an international conference, Italy will make its participation conditional on satisfying its demands on France, and it is deeply believed here that the President's telegram will be regarded as a useless letter and will not be the basis for making counter-demands.

[Reuters, Rome, 17th] Göring set off today to return to Berlin. Before that, he discussed President Roosevelt's peace proposals with Mussolini. Italy's reply is expected to be published at the same time as Germany's reply.

[Associated Press, Rome, 17th] General Göring left here today and returned to Berlin quickly. It is said that he has a simple reply from Mussolini to President Roosevelt's appeal telegram. The Axis countries have expressed their hatred of those who claim that they are causing difficulties, and any suggestions based on such remarks will be rejected. It is generally expected that the German reply will be decided after Göring returns to his country and consults with Hitler and Ribbentrop.

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] Secretary of State Hull told reporters today that since President Roosevelt issued a peace appeal to Hitler and Mussolini, the world's concept of peace has increased with it. Hull continued, the government is very grateful for the enthusiastic response of European and Western Hemisphere countries to the President's telegram, and the general public has felt that the President's move is a practical peace contribution that adapts to the times, and at the same time, the greatest power to maintain peace, that is, the public's concept, has shown strong development everywhere in the world. As for how Berlin and Rome will answer the President's call, no news has been received so far.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] Regarding President Roosevelt's telegram to Hitler and Mussolini, the State Council has received many replies from various countries. All Latin American countries except Haiti, Honduras, Guatemala, and Paraguay have expressed their approval. The Canadian government also sent a telegram, expressing admiration. The telegram from the President of Brazil said that Your Excellency's move is worthy of being the leader of the American continent, and the remarks you made have resonated in our country. The President of Cuba said in a telegram that our government read the telegram yesterday and was deeply impressed. Your Excellency is worthy of being a famous politician. On behalf of the people of the whole country, I publicly express the solidarity between the two countries.

### Italian Envoy in Albania Promoted

[Central News Agency, Rome, 18th] The Italian Minister to Albania has been promoted to Ambassador.

### Yugoslavia Will Form a Coalition Government; Croatia Will Be Autonomous

### French Warships Gather in the Port of Gibraltar; British Warships Are Stationed in Malta; Actions Against Authoritarian Countries

[Associated Press, Gibraltar, 17th] Eighteen warships have concentrated here, coinciding with reports that authoritarian countries will take action against Tangier. The British fleet is also stationed in Malta. It is believed that this action by the British and French fleets is related to the German navy's exercises on the Spanish coast and the rumor that the Spanish Moroccan army has increased from 40,000 to 90,000.

[Central News Agency, Gibraltar, 18th] Gibraltar is now concentrated with many French warships. In recent years, the number of French warships sailing to this port has never been so large as this time. Three destroyers arrived here yesterday. The current total number is twelve, and several more are expected to arrive there last night.

[Central News Agency, Gibraltar, 17th] Two French battleships and two destroyers arrived in this port yesterday. Today, three cruisers, namely the Marseille, La Galissonnière, and Jean de Vienne, and six destroyers, namely the Valda, Mogador, Bold, Hurricane, Happiness, and Simon, successively arrived under the command of French Navy Generals Marquis and Lacroix, respectively. In total, there are 13 ships. At the same time, the Spanish destroyer Sodorro also arrived at the Spanish port of Algeciras, close to the port of Gibraltar.

[Central News Agency, Gibraltar, 17th] According to reliable information, French warships will continue to arrive here today.

[Reuters, Gibraltar, 17th] There are currently 13 French warships stationed in Gibraltar, and the entire British Mediterranean Fleet is currently stationed in and near Malta. There are also several British ships stationed in Gibraltar, mostly destroyers, which have been stationed there.

The plan of the exercise closely imitates the situation of war, and passing merchant ships are prevented from stopping and inquiring.

### Woodring Delivers a Speech; The United States Must Expand Its Military; The Senate Passes Additional Army Funding; Pacific Naval Facilities Will Be Improved

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] The Senate today passed an additional funding bill of $152,000,000, of which $11,000,000 was allocated for army equipment, such as the purchase of semi-automatic rifles, tanks, tank guns, anti-aircraft guns, gas masks, artillery, and bullets.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] Army Minister Woodring said in a speech here tonight that the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans are currently shrouded in war clouds, and people all over the world are caught in the terror of war. The United States' finances and economy are also adversely affected. Therefore, it is necessary for the United States to expand its military. Due to the invention of modern new weapons, Americans should feel that although the United States has the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans as protection, it is no longer safe. From a military point of view, the United States can no longer be a single continent.

### The Mysterious Politician of South Africa

— A Translation

This South African Minister of Defence, Piro Aus Watt, caused much speculation about the future of the former German colonies in Africa because of his trip through European capitals last November. What kind of person is he? It hasn't been many months since Mr. Piro shook the world with a word. His words were:

"The ruling class of Great Britain agrees with the proposition that 'unless a way is found to compensate Germany for its lost colonies, relations with Germany can never be built on a foundation of peaceful coexistence.' And this compensation can only be sought in Africa. To maintain the dominance of white people on the African continent, nothing is more important than cooperation between Africa and Germany. I can say that the authorities agree with me on this point."

This declaration was clearly the peak of Mr. Piro's struggle. Then he had another most frightening declaration:

"I am very happy to see Germany return to Africa in the future, because only the Nazis know how to treat the natives."

Piro Aus Watt began his political career as one of the leaders of the Transvaal Republican Party. In 1929, he was the youngest cabinet member in General Hertzog's government. Later, he was appointed Minister of Railways and Harbours. During his tenure, he fully demonstrated his organizational skills. At this time, the financial situation of the state-owned railways and harbors was very bad. Piro reorganized the internal organization and transformed almost every year's deficit into a surplus.

He hoped to be promoted and got his wish. He jumped to become Minister of Defense.

An outstanding speaker and political schemer, he is now one of the prominent figures in South Africa. They know the value of contacting the masses. He drives his own plane and his own car. Once, when the natives demonstrated in Durban, he flew there, took the position of police chief, led the attacking team, and dispersed the assembled natives with tear gas. When the crowd was tired of hearing about the lions he had killed and other suppression stories, his interest shifted to international politics. In order to justify his words, Piro declared that all countries that own African colonies should transfer part of them to Germany. This is the fairest thing, and that is all he meant. It is generally speculated that he was specifically referring to Angola and Cameroon.

Now, Piro has kept his pro-German attitude relatively hidden and focused most of his energy on improving South Africa's defense. When we consider his friendly attitude towards Williams Stiles together, we can't help but ask: "What does Piro want?" A well-known former South African minister once answered this question: "The answer is not complicated. Our Minister of Defense has great ambitions. His greatest desire is to be Prime Minister. So he is riding two horses at the same time, running in two directions. He emphasizes Germany's colonial demands and spreads the theories of the black peril. But in order to win British votes and show his loyalty to England, he also advocates the establishment of a national defense organization and the creation of a South African wartime industry."

But no matter what Piro's ambitions are, he has indeed made great contributions to the defense of the South African Federation. The improvement of the Yskor factories, which are sufficient to become the basis of a large metallurgical industry, is so large that many South Africans believe that the region's metallurgical plants will soon become the center of British military industry.

### More Than a Dozen Fishing Boats Burned and Destroyed off the Coast of Chekwan; More Than a Hundred Fishermen Burned to Death; First Machine-Gunned and Then Incendiary Bombs Were Thrown; Only One of More Than a Hundred Fishermen Escaped; Losses Exceeded 100,000 Yuan

Since the beginning of the war of resistance, the coastal fishing boats and houses off the coast of Chekwan, Tan Kwong Shan, Wan Shan Mei, Tai O Island, Chalan Lighthouse, Kylin Pain Terrace, Miu Wan, Pak Lik Island, Man Chau Mei, A Chau Hoi, Sam Mun Kwan, 급락, Tung Kwu Tan, Kit Sek Wan, Ling Hang, and Gwo Chau have been devastated by × warships. The deaths of people, the burning and looting of fishing boats, and the loss of property are countless. Unexpectedly, on the 14th of this month, more than a dozen fishing boats off the coast of Chekwan were bombarded by random guns from × warships, and more than 100 fishermen were brutally killed by × bombs. The loss of property amounted to more than 100,000 yuan. Only one fisherman escaped and arrived in Hong Kong. According to him,

Chekwan Coast Suddenly Suffers Misfortune

Since the × warships wreaked havoc on the coast at will, the fishing boats have been reluctant to go far. They only made a living in the sea. However, it was not a long-term solution to sit and eat the mountains. So they were forced to go out to sea again to fish. What they got every day was only enough to support themselves. Recently, in the past month or two, they have caught a lot of fish. The industry is more or less the trend. On the 13th of this month, they went out to sea to fish in groups from Po On County. Before they could start, a destroyer suddenly came tailing them. They dispersed and fled, and the × warship did not chase them. At 6 p.m., they gathered in Chekwan to fish. The harvest was quite abundant on that day. That night, all the boats were anchored in the waters of Da Chekwan. Unexpectedly, around midnight, they suddenly heard the sound of huge ships churning the waves. They knew it was not a good sign and hurriedly wanted to hoist their sails and escape. However, in a hurry, they had no way to implement it, so they waited quietly to see what would happen. Soon they saw a × steamship speeding from the Pacific Ocean, the surface of the river at the southern tip of Po On County, and × used a searchlight to scan the coast, and their fishing boats were seen.

Fishing Boats Were Hit and Burned

Seeing more than a dozen fishing boats gathered in the waters of Chekwan, × warships then fired machine guns at the fishing boats, dozens of rounds at a time, as dense as a string of beads, and then threw incendiary bombs. It was in the middle of the night, and it could be heard far and wide. Wherever it went, it was hit and caught fire. More than a dozen fishing boats were unable to escape and were hit and caught fire. His boat was also hit by several bullets. For a time, the fire was blazing, and the sea was red. The sad voices of calling for help were unbearable to hear and see. Dozens of fishing boats were destroyed by × bombs, and more than 100 fishermen were brutally buried in the fire pit, creating an unprecedented tragedy. His boat was also on fire soon after, so he escaped into the water. At that time, the sea was stormy, and the water flow was rapid. He was exhausted and exhausted less than a minute after falling into the water, so he let the sea drift. Just in the midst of the crisis, a cargo boat happened to pass by, saw the situation, rescued him and brought him to Hong Kong. More than 100 people were killed in this disaster, more than a dozen fishing boats were burned, and the loss of property was nearly 100,000 yuan.

### Strengthening Air Defense; Another Blackout Drill Will Be Held; Simulating a Sudden Air Raid Alert; No Prior Notice Will Be Given; Upon Hearing the Alert, Lights Must Be Immediately Turned Off; All Air Defense Organizations Will Be Simultaneously Tested With Extreme Rigor

The Hong Kong government authorities, in order to actively strengthen passive air defense, are sparing no effort to prepare the necessary facilities for air defense. They have purchased many of the latest alarm instruments and installed them in various selected locations. After the test release on Friday afternoon of last week, the air defense authorities stated that the results of the test release were quite satisfactory, but one location did not seem to need to install this alarm and it is planned to move it to another location. Now it is felt that there are still many missing alarms and seven more alarm instruments have been purchased from England in order to install them in suitable locations. These alarms will be shipped soon.

Blackout Will Not Be Notified in Advance

The former air defense authorities are also planning to conduct a simulated alarm release based on an actual attack. If the Hong Kong authorities approve, they will issue an air raid alert and hold a blackout drill without prior notice when necessary. At that time, all Hong Kong residents, if they hear the alarm, must immediately carry out appropriate control of their lights, so that Hong Kong will be in a black state within a few minutes, and all street lights will also be turned off until the alarm is lifted before normal can be restored. In this exercise, all air defense organizations will be tested extremely rigorously, such as the police force, ambulance team, traffic team, fire brigade, air defense monitors, and disinfection team, etc., will be fully mobilized, and their work efficiency will be specifically demonstrated at that time.

Urge All Businesses to Send Staff for Training

In addition, Hong Kong Air Defense Commissioner Starkie imparted air defense knowledge to residents to obtain more cadres during wartime, he specially set up various training classes, and on the 4th of this month, he divided up the major businesses in Hong Kong, inviting one or two employees to participate.

The Air Defense Bureau will hold an examination for air defense monitors and trainers at the Jockey Club Public Restaurant on the 26th to the 28th of this month, from 5:45 pm to 7 pm for three consecutive days. Anyone who wants to participate in the examination must report to the Air Defense Bureau before the next Friday.

### Wang角 Canton Road: A Large Brawl Occurred Yesterday; Dozens Engaged in Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat, the Cause Being a Dispute over a Woman; Fists Flew and Sticks Came Crashing Down, Many Heads Were Split Open

Last night at six o'clock, on the vacant lot at the end of Canton Road in Mong Kok, dozens of men suddenly appeared, radiating murderous intent. They lined up facing each other, glaring angrily, rubbing their fists and palms, waiting for the moment to strike. Two or three people from each side were in the middle, negotiating and discussing, but in less than ten minutes, somehow, the two sides clashed, fists and feet flying, short sticks waving wildly. The shouts of battle created an uproar. Dozens of people scattered and charged, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat. Within just over ten minutes, six or seven people had already been injured, all with heads split open,

Fresh Blood Gushing Out,

splattering all over their bodies, turning them into blood-soaked figures. Two of them fell to the ground, unable to get up, while the two sides continued to fight fiercely. Nearby residents, witnessing the scene, feared that it would escalate into a fatal tragedy and sounded the alarm. Instantly, the sound of police whistles and the shouts of the crowd resonated far and wide. Three Indian policemen and two Chinese policemen who were nearby heard the news and rushed to the scene, panting. Seeing dozens of reckless men engaged in violent brawling, they immediately stepped forward to suppress them and quickly arrested two of them who were wielding short sticks, stopping them from causing further harm. When the thugs saw the police arrive, they scattered like frightened birds and beasts, fleeing in all directions towards Tai Kok Tsui and Sham Shui Po. The two injured men who had fallen to the ground, fearing arrest, struggled to their feet and, taking advantage of the police's inattention, were helped by their companions to quickly run up the nearby stairs to hide. Because of the bloodstains that were smeared all over the ground, the police, unable to find any trace of the fleeing men, took the two arrested men and the five short sticks they had collected back to the police station for detention and investigation. One man gave his name as Li, and the other as Chen. Li was a worker at a timber shop on Canton Road, and Chen was an unemployed rogue. They both firmly denied having organized a brawl or disturbing public order. However, the police detectives, seeing the bloodstains on the ground and not knowing the extent of the injuries of the wounded, detained them for further investigation while sending detectives to investigate. According to informants, the dozens of rioters involved in the brawl were members of the Wo and Tung gangs, and the reason for their fight was a dispute over a prostitute, jealousy and a quarrel over a woman. It is said that many people on both sides were seriously injured and sought treatment from a famous bone-setter afterward. The two sides are still continuing negotiations, and if a resolution cannot be reached, there will likely be a second organized brawl.

Fortunately, a small number of sampans and boats still shuttled between Macau and Hong Kong at that time, which did not cause the supply to be completely cut off, but this was not enough to maintain it for a long time, and the traffic of goods and passengers was also inconvenient. Recently, after our army bravely resisted the war and recovered Shaping and Gulou and other places, the Macau-Sanbu ferry, seeing that the waterway was accessible, changed course and tried to sail to Hong Kong, Macau, and Sanbu, hoping to restore normal traffic. Yesterday, it was found that the ferries had completed their trial voyages a few days ago and officially announced the resumption of service yesterday. When people from Siyi in this area heard this news, many returned to their hometown to inspect, and women and children in the war zone in Siyi also took the ferry directly to Macau and then to Hong Kong. In recent days, ferries to Hong Kong and Macau have become more crowded, and the supply of freshwater fish and vegetables has especially increased, with more being transported to Hong Kong for supply. According to a person in the fruit business, Sanbu has now resumed operation, and there is no need to worry about a shortage of vegetables in Hong Kong.

### After Our Army Recovered Zengcheng, The Northeast and Northwest Routes Attacked Taipingchang; Our Army in Zengcheng Attacked Southward, Attacking Shitan and Reaching Luogang; Ye Zhao Inspected the Frontline of Zengcong and Met with the Eastern Front Commanders

[Dongjiang Express] After three days and nights of bloody battles, the Eastern Route of our army formally recovered Zengcheng on the 15th and suppressed the remnants of the enemy. The details of the process have been recorded in detail in the previous report. It has been determined that our current army, in addition to organizing post-war affairs in Zengcheng and appeasing refugees, is also using mobile warfare tactics to attack Taipingchang in a pincer movement to control the throat of Guangzhou, and attacking Shitan to the south to control the Jiulong Railway and cut off the Nuanzhou rear of the Shilong enemy forces. The two main forces are advancing separately and directly, and have successively arrived at Taipingchang and Shangluogang and other places near Shitan, engaging in fierce battles with the enemy. The battle situation is recorded below:

According to military sources, after our army entered Zengcheng, it quickly pursued the remnants of the enemy fleeing from Zengtan and Zengguang Highways in a swift manner, not allowing them to catch their breath. When the enemy on the Zengtan Highway was defeated by our army, the enemy on the Zengguang Road stubbornly resisted in Zhucun. However, after a night of hard fighting, they were finally unable to withstand the defeat and fled on the evening of the 16th. It was found that at that time, in addition to sending the above two routes to pursue the remnants of the enemy, our army also ordered the main force under Huang Tao and Wen Shuhai, which was moving eastward from the Zengcong Line, to return to the north and counterattack the southeast of Taipingchang across Fuhe. Our army that recovered Huaxian also moved east from Shijiao, approaching the northwest of Taipingchang. On the 15th, an arc-shaped encirclement was formed, and the counterattack began on the 16th. Our army attacked from above and below, and the enemy in Taipingchang was attacked from the left and right. However, this place was where the main force of the enemy was located, and it was also an important stronghold on the periphery of Guangzhou. Therefore, the enemy resisted stubbornly, making repeated efforts, and advancing fearlessly. By the 17th, they had forced their way close to the four townships of Taiping, where the stubborn enemy was already wavering, and it would not be difficult to defeat them.

Our Army in Zengcheng Advances into Shitan

After the troops under Wei, Liu, and Chen of the 9th Army Group defeated the enemy fleeing from the Zengtan Highway, they regained their spirits and continued to advance. On the 17th, they went to eliminate the remnants of the enemy fleeing to Zagang and engaged in fierce battles with the enemy, with considerable gains. On the evening of the 16th, a guerrilla team under Shan Peirong, together with a daredevil team of more than 200 regular soldiers, once rushed into Shitan and attacked the enemy's headquarters for about an hour, achieving their goal and safely withdrawing to the rear. They still secretly control the four suburbs to cooperate with the advance of our army. The result of the night raid was also a great success, capturing several machine guns and an enemy flag. At present, the main force of our front-line troops is concentrated on the Zengtan Highway, advancing steadily and calmly. Now that Shitan has been controlled by our army, it will not be difficult for us to capture it in one fell swoop unless the enemy greatly reinforces it.

Ye Zhao Inspects the Frontline of Zengcong

The troops that counterattacked Zengcheng this time were jointly attacked by the Ninth and Twelfth Army Groups. Ye Zhao, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Twelfth Army Group, now believed that our army's counterattack against Zengcheng had achieved its purpose, and the encirclement of Guangzhou had also been completed. In order to promote the advance into Guangzhou and instruct the combat plan, he specially inspected the frontline of Zengcheng and Conghua on the 16th and met with Zhang Deneng and Chen Rongji, the frontline division commanders of the Ninth Army Group. The next morning (the 16th), he continued to visit Donglu, the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route, Wu Qiyuan, in a certain place, and discussed the future conquest opportunities. He can return to the front line to supervise the battle in three or two days.

The North Bank of Dongjiang Is Largely Cleared

Luo Fengxiang, the Commander of the Guerrilla of the Third District Column, believed that as the Eastern Route counter-offensive progressed and the guerrilla team was responsible for assisting the regular army in storming the enemy and maintaining local security, the future task would be even more important. In order to closely contact the Fourth Guerrilla Area to increase combat effectiveness, he specially dispatched Chief of Staff Xie Jingbai to be responsible for contacting everything. Xie was ordered to arrive at the front line of Dongguan on the 16th and visited Wang Ruozhou, the Commander of the Guerrilla of the Fourth District Column, and Chi Zhongkuan, the Commander of the Southeastern Coast, to discuss everything. It was also found that since our army recovered Zengcheng and the remnants of the enemy fled to Shitan, there were no more enemy traces in the north bank of the Dongjiang River, except for Shilong. Masi, Longjiao, Jutou, Shangxianan, and other areas are all within our army's sphere of influence, and people in various places have also mobilized to participate in the War of Resistance, assisting in clearing out traitors and rectifying local areas, which is extremely exciting and enthusiastic.

Counterattack Liantang, Recover Guifeng

On the morning of the same day, the enemy used more than 100 infantry and cavalry, accompanied by several artillery pieces, and attacked the positions of our army in Fen Shui Jiang. Machine guns and steel cannons were as dense as firecrackers. The security team of Gu Dinhua's Fifth District Guerrilla Team stationed there rose up to meet the enemy and launched fierce battles in Damei, Xiaomei Village, Dabaishan, Tianzidi, and Liantang. They then moved slightly to the rear and firmly defended Daze. Zhou Hanling, the Deputy Commander, led the seventh regiment of the security team, Yang Ganji, and launched a counterattack at the dawn of the day. After about three hours of dust warfare, the enemy had suffered more than half of their casualties and gradually became unsustainable. Our team took advantage of the momentum to defeat the enemy and pursued them to Guifeng Mountain. The entire enemy was resolved, and the enemy's corpses were scattered all over the field. We captured nine sun flags, more than fifty rifles, and destroyed two artillery pieces. It was found that Guifeng Mountain was the vanguard of Daze Niowan, which has now been recovered by our army, making both places more stable. The enemy's plot to spy on Danshuikou is even more difficult to achieve. It was also found that since our army recovered Shaping, the market situation has gradually recovered. Ou Jian, the magistrate of Jiaoshan County, has sent many officials to assist in handling local post-war affairs, relieving refugees, and appeasing refugees. The market has been partially restored since the 15th.

### The Battle of Xinhui: Our Army Has a Significant Advantage; The Enemy Attacking Du Ruan Suffered Heavy Losses; We Recovered Guifeng Mountain With a Bamboo-Breaking Momentum

[Zhongshan Express] Regarding the Battle of Xinhui, our army has taken a steady and solid step for the past ten days due to the adjustment of time and position, and the enemy has been repeatedly strongly resisted, and its morale has also been reduced. Although it still continues to attack our army's positions, this is only an act of harassing, containing, and probing the strength of our army. The military situation in Jiangmen Huicheng is as follows:

Our Army in Du Ruan Induces the Enemy to Gather and Annihilate

It was reported here yesterday that at about 9:00 AM on the 15th, about 200 members of the enemy's naval landing force, 17 tanks, and 60 or 70 cavalry gathered and attacked the positions of our army in Douruan Jinggen Pingling in the Third District, with a fierce momentum. First, they fired violently with steel cannons, followed by armored vehicles in the lead, with cavalry attached, covering the advance of the infantry. Our army induced the enemy to go deep, leaving only a small force to defend Du Ruan, acting in a circuitous manner, fighting and retreating. The enemy mistakenly believed that our army was fearful and ignored everything, rushing forward. Our army induced the enemy to the mountains at the junction of Du Ruan City, Songtai Ridge, Jinggen Shuanglou and Shimao Mountain, and immediately returned the banner and beat the drum, and the four armies came out. The enemy soldiers suffered a counterattack, were panicked and at a loss, and the formation was chaotic, unable to advance or retreat. They were forced to entangle with us, and the short-range melee was achieved. By the morning of the 16th, the enemy was defeated. In this battle, 36 enemies were killed, countless were wounded, one tank was destroyed, more than ten war horses were wounded and killed, and a great victory was achieved.

### The Enemy Gathers in Haikou to Discuss the Management of Qiongzhou; Starts with Military Control; Dumps Enemy Goods to Revitalize the Market

[Nanlu Express] According to military reports, since the enemy's invasion of Qiongzhou Island, our guerrillas have been exceptionally active, attacking from time to time, making it impossible to manage Qiongzhou. The enemy general Kondo Nobutake specially summoned senior generals in Haikou again in the early part of this month to discuss how to deal with our guerrillas and the Qiongya plan. It is said that it has been decided that: (1) Dispatch telegrams to the Tokyo Taiwan Enemy Headquarters and the Guangzhou Enemy Headquarters for assistance, transfer enemy divisions to the south, suppress the enemy's pseudo-army war, and reverse the malpractices, prevent our guerrillas from operating, occupy the entire Qiong, and set up solid defenses in various important strongholds and traffic hubs to control the surrounding villages; (2) Step up the establishment of puppet regimes, carry out political and economic aggression, actively develop Haikou City, and massively transport enemy goods into Qiong to revitalize various market businesses in order to seize the money of our people and supplement its lack of military resources; (3) Open up naval, land, and air force bases, airports, warehouses, military ports, and complete the transportation network and transportation stations in each occupied area to facilitate military transport and the development of resources for the promotion of business products. It was found that the enemy's gathering was actually due to the fact that there has been no progress in the use of Qiong for three months. However, since the division of the four regions and the expansion of guerrilla warfare in various parts of Qiongya, they still maintain the active and favorable position. The enemy's plan to map and manage Qiongzhou Island will inevitably fail to achieve its intended purpose.

### Song Ziwen and Chen Ce Show Concern for their Hometown, Planning Relief for Qiongya, Aiming to Raise Funds and Contribute Efforts to Prepare Relief, and Requesting Assistance from Overseas Qiongya Compatriots to Proceed

Since the violent Japanese army trampled into Qiongya, the brutality is unspeakable, the people in the island are displaced, and the disaster is severe. It is the undeniable responsibility of overseas Qiongya compatriots to provide relief to their hometowns. Since the outbreak of the war, they have intensified their efforts to raise funds. It is learned that Chen Ce and Song Ziwen, the initiators of the Overseas Qiongya Federation, recently drafted various measures for relieving Qiongya refugees and sent separate letters to Qiongya organizations in various places, requesting them to consider adopting and implementing them. They encouraged compatriots to raise funds and contribute efforts to save their hometown and the country. The contents of the draft relief plan are as follows: (1) Dispatch personnel to Qiongya to express condolences and mobilize the people. Send representatives to Qiongya to express condolences to the military and civilians fighting against the Japanese, to boost morale and coordinate efforts, and mobilize the general public to assist the regular army in carrying out extensive and sustained guerrilla warfare, to drive out the Japanese and recover lost territories. At the same time, dispatch service teams carrying health medicines to Qiongya to engage in rescue work. (2) Strengthen military power. Military pay, weapons, and medicines are the lifeblood of the army. Since Qiongya was blockaded by the Japanese, transportation has been obstructed, and replenishment is difficult. However, to persist in the war of resistance and strive for the final victory, we must still seek continuous assistance. This matter has been planned separately and is being handled. Because it involves secrets, it is not convenient to disclose, so it is omitted. (3) Enhance economic strength. Under the strategy of protracted war and total war, we must strive to concentrate manpower and, in particular, strive to enrich financial resources. Although there are many methods, the most urgent task is to establish a bank. Before Qiongya was in crisis, there was already this plan. Now that the Japanese army is rampant and the country is waiting to be saved, we must speed up the realization to meet the urgent needs. It is planned to establish a Qiongya Bank headquarters in Hong Kong, and branches will be established in various ports in Southeast Asia. The draft articles of association will be ready as soon as preparations are completed, and stock subscription can be started and announced. (4) Relieve refugees. After Huanxian County, Qiongya, fell to the Japanese, many people in the inland fled to Guangzhou Bay and Hong Kong. The Overseas Chinese General Association recently sent personnel to various places to investigate. As a result, it was planned to provide relief separately in two aspects: active and passive. The methods are as follows: A. Passive aspect: (1) Establish a refugee reception center in the Guangzhou French Concession to provide temporary accommodation and assign personnel to be stationed there permanently to be responsible for reception and guidance, to avoid the suffering of unfamiliarity. (2) Currently, there is a sudden famine in the inland of Qiongya. The general public, even if they are not cannon fodder, will starve to death. We have already consulted with charitable organizations to find ways to transport food back to Qiongya for distribution. (3) Refugees who arrive in Guangzhou Bay or Hong Kong (except for those who have destinations) will be sent to refugee camps, refugee children will be sent to refugee orphanages, and the sick will be sent to Tung Wah Hospital. B. Active aspect: (1) Establish a refugee reclamation area in Zhiman, Guangzhou Bay Concession, to engage in agricultural production for long-term relief. (2) Establish a refugee reclamation area in the New Territories of Hong Kong to engage in agricultural and industrial production to become self-sufficient. Also, establish a self-reliance school in Hong Kong to accommodate Qiongya war zone out-of-school youths to learn various skills to make a living. (3) Select a site in Yunnan Province to prepare for the establishment of a Qiongya refugee reclamation area to engage in agricultural and industrial production, because Jiangxi Province has fewer opportunities for military disasters, and it borders Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar, which is convenient for overseas Chinese from various places in Southeast Asia to travel to and from.

### Shenzhen News: Our Army Captures Shilong and Presses on Guangzhou, Our Army also Gains Advantage in the Northwest River Battle, Encirclement of Guangzhou Completed Further

In the Guangdong battle, our army launched a large-scale counter-offensive on Guangzhou from the east, west, and north routes for days, advancing with encirclement, making repeated progress. Shilong, an important town in the East River, was also confirmed to have been recovered on the previous (17th) day, according to the Shenzhen news yesterday afternoon. A part of the wounded soldiers of our army participating in this line of operations was transported to the Sino-British border yesterday for treatment. According to a wounded soldier who told the "South China Morning Post" reporter, our army's counter-offensive on Shilong started on the evening of the 16th. After several hours of fierce fighting, our army was finally able to break into the city and recover Shilong. According to another wounded soldier, when he was wounded and withdrew from the front line, our army was already near Shilong, and the battle was in an absolutely advantageous position. About fifty wounded soldiers were transported back to the Sino-British border area for treatment, all of whom were from the No. × Security Team, commanded by Deputy Commander Zhang Rong. A wounded soldier said that after receiving the general counter-offensive order on the 17th, the battle started at dawn. After fierce fighting between the two sides until late at night, after several charges and hand-to-hand combat, our army finally broke into the city. He was shot and wounded in the fierce battle and withdrew. It is expected that wounded soldiers will continue to be transported today. This counter-offensive on Shilong is part of the overall counter-offensive plan in Guangdong, with the aim of advancing to overcome Guangzhou. In Zengcheng and Conghua, our two armies are also in fierce fighting. According to a reporter from the "South China Morning Post" stationed in Guangzhou, a part of the Chinese army's vanguards has approached the suburbs of Guangdong. The spokesperson of the Japanese army in Guangzhou also admitted that there were considerable losses, but refused to publish anything about the actual situation. The Chinese army launched a counter-offensive from the Sanshui area, making the Japanese army busy dealing with it. Therefore, the Japanese army's garrison force in this area is extremely weak. Even the Guangzhou Japanese radio station admitted that the Chinese army's counter-offensive in the East River has approached the Japanese army's inner defense line. There will be a major battle in Xinjie on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. The Japanese army has withdrawn from Zhongluotan. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to approach Guangzhou, and the large-scale encirclement situation was further realized. The Chinese army in Conghua made considerable progress. The troops participating in the battle here are the elite troops trained by General Cai Tingkai of the former 19th Route Army in Luoding.

### Lost Their Minds, Bandit Party Armed Robbery, Robbed the Datanshan Steamer, Our Team Rushed to Rescue and Ten Bandits Were Killed

[Express News from Kaiping] The Daheshanshan electric boat, which runs between Sanbu and Qianshan, set off from Sanbu to Qianshan on the morning of the 13th. It carried 83 passengers. The journey was calm and peaceful as usual. Unexpectedly, at 7 pm, when it reached the river surface of Zhoumu, Xinhui (about two miles from Zhoumu), because the river was narrow, the boat had to drive slowly. Suddenly, five speedboats carrying more than 30 bandits, chasing behind, shouted to stop the boat. At that time, all the partners and passengers on the Dashan Tai steamer were unaware and continued to drive forward. The bandits thought they were deliberately resisting the order and immediately used machine guns to strafe the steamer, immediately smashing the steamer's engine. The bandit boats took the opportunity to approach the steamer, and then more than 20 bandits with weapons boarded the boat and robbed it. The local guerrilla team discovered this and rushed to the rescue. The bandits relied on the boat to resist arrest and fought the guerrilla team. As a result, the bandits were defeated and more than ten people were killed. Our team also waded across the water to board the boat and captured three bandits. The remaining bandits fled in different directions. Two passengers, one male and one female, were killed on the spot, nine were injured, and nine crew members were injured. The loss amounted to more than a thousand yuan.

### Xiamen Japanese Army Fights Internally, Taiwanese Soldiers Dismissed

[Special Correspondence from Xiamen] After the Japanese army occupied Xiamen, more than 4,000 Taiwanese soldiers were sent from Taiwan and stationed in the city for a long time. These thousands of Taiwanese soldiers roamed the city's restaurants and brothels every day, and their military discipline was corrupt. Yesterday (12th), six Taiwanese soldiers were walking on Siming Road when they encountered three Taiwanese girls. They went forward to flirt with them. At that time, a team of Japanese military police happened to be walking there and stepped forward to intervene. The Taiwanese soldiers refused to obey and accused the Japanese army of indecency, which led to a conflict. The six Taiwanese soldiers were arrested. When other Taiwanese soldiers heard about it, they made a lot of noise and almost caused a conflict. Finally, the Japanese army sent a team of Taiwanese soldiers back to their hometowns.

Isolated Island Silver Screen

Xinhua Factory House Relocation Negotiation

(Shanghai Correspondence) The Xinhua Film Company's film factory was relocated to Lilac Garden on Haige Road last autumn. The internal location is spacious and has the advantage of garden flowers and trees. It is very convenient for shooting exterior scenes. At that time, an agreement was signed with the owner to lease it, which was originally a long-term nature. Xinhua was also preparing to build a large studio as a basic camp. Recently, the owner, Xu, made other plans and suddenly sold the Jinbu real estate to someone else for a price of 3 million yuan. Because of this change of ownership, the lease could not be renewed. Xu demanded that Xinhua relocate. Regarding this loss, Xu was willing to compensate Xinhua five times the high gold to terminate the contract because of his responsibility. However, the actual loss suffered by Xinhua is estimated to be nearly 100,000 yuan. Therefore, the difference between the two sides is too large, and it is not easy to resolve. If the dispute continues, a lawsuit may occur.

Shanghai Light MGM Mei Sparks Dispute

The Shanghai Light Theater's film screening policy was originally based on second-run Western films as the main film and supplemented by first-run domestic films. A long-term contract was signed with MGM Guosi in the early days to screen all its productions. Recently, the Shanghai Light Theater premiered Huacheng Company's "Mulan Joins the Army" and the business is booming. It has been screened for a long time and has not stopped. As a result, MGM has accumulated many films and cannot be screened, so it filed a negotiation with the theater, causing a serious dispute. The Shanghai Light Theater is still selling tickets for "Mulan Joins the Army", which means it does not want to give it up easily. Huacheng also does not allow it to stop screening. This dispute with MGM is on the verge of breaking down, making it difficult for Shanghai Light Theater to take care of everything. Later, it made three explanations to MGM and agreed to postpone the screening date of Huacheng's second film "Cloud Fairy", which was originally scheduled to follow "Mulan Joins the Army", and replace it with the company's Western film for one month. MGM's attitude eased and the dispute was temporarily resolved.

Three Parties Compete for Renting the Summer Piccadilly

Summer Piccadilly is the earliest established and only cinema in Shanghai, dating back to 1914, and has been around for 26 years. In the early years, it was a very popular and modern entertainment venue. Later, many new-style theaters were built one after another, gradually being eliminated by the times and inevitably becoming outdated. In recent years, it has been covered with cobwebs and dust, and has been closed for a long time. After the war, waste was used and it was opened as a refugee camp. There are still many refugees trapped inside. The isolated island entertainment business is currently in a state of abnormal development, because a Mr. Huang invested 2,000 gold two months ago to rent the theater, intending to resume business. However, due to the age of the building, according to the survey by the Public Works Department, the roof must be dismantled and rebuilt. The repair cost is estimated to be about 30,000 yuan, so I have been hesitating so far and have not been able to organize it. Recently, other parties have started to compete for renting the theater, forming a triangular dispute. It is said that Fang has Lu Zhonglian acting as mediator, and it is likely that Huang will recover some expenses and transfer it to Liu to take over. In these few months, there will be one more cinema soon.

### Happy Angel (4)

She was suddenly very proud, "Ah, Mr. Fan... you want to invite me,"

Harry flinched a little, "Don't put on that look, I'm just trying to repay you for your kindness in fooling around tonight, I want to invite you to have coffee,"

"You are very polite," she laughed charmingly, "I am really honored to be able to go to a restaurant with you,"

"Wait until you see the restaurant,"

It was a Greek restaurant called Yuan, and they each ordered some food,

"Is this enough for you to eat? Good girl," Harry looked at her ordering very little,

"Ah, I can order more later, but, my name is not Good Girl, my name is Eileen,"

"It doesn't matter much, I call everyone Good Girl,"

"Perhaps, that's why I want to protest," she said, suddenly looking very proud, "I am not everyone,"

"Ah, I'm very sorry, I deserve your rebuke,"

"I," Eileen laughed, weaving her hand and stroking his arm, expressing forgiveness, "I am not rebuking you. Harry,"

"That's fine," he replied coldly. "I'm not very embarrassed either."

At this time, the food they ordered was served, and Eileen lowered her head, eating and whispering, "Harry, I can learn those codes,"

"Do you think so?" he said disbelievingly, "That's a very profound and complex thing,"

"I can learn it, we can cooperate very well. In the future, I can see my name in neon lights on the streets of London, Eileen - The Great Eileen - with Harry Fan,"

"You took a little advantage in words,"

"You will also like London," Eileen's eyes were shining. "When I escaped from the Soviet Union as a child, ah, that was really a special experience, Mr. Fan, I must tell you,"

"Okay, okay," Harry nodded, "But, we have four more performances tomorrow, and, you are going to dance, you should get a good sleep,"

Just then, someone turned on the radio and broadcast a song,

"Listen," Eileen said softly, "Do you know this song? This is a Russian song," called "One Night of Joy," her intention was to say that two people met in a good night, fell in love, and then dispersed in an instant. Ah, how lovely the music is, it takes me back to the old, far away, icy and snowy St. Petersburg," she hummed along with the music, Harry looked at her in confusion, there was a magical allure in her, which no woman he had ever met before had,

"Ah, what a beautiful story," she murmured softly, her eyes shining, staring at Harry, her lips parted slightly, Harry felt the blood in his body flowing rapidly, the situation was so tense that he quickly paid the bill and urged Eileen to come out. When they arrived at the theater dormitory, he said good night and let her go upstairs first, because he wanted to avoid going upstairs with her in an elevator,

Ten minutes later, he also went upstairs. As he approached his door, he was suddenly surprised because there was light in his room. He rushed in without knocking. Eileen was inside, sitting behind the table, wearing a bathrobe, with one of his socks tied over her eyes. He rushed over in three steps and snatched the sock,

"Who allowed you to tie my best socks on your head, and how did you get in?"

"The keys to every door here are the same," she looked at him pleadingly,

"Okay," he glared at her, "Now what do you want?"

"Please teach me those codes, Harry,"

"No," he said fiercely, but as he looked at her, he felt that he was not strong enough, he could not send her out, she made him weak, before and after, no woman had been able to make him like this. For Harry Fan, women were all stupid,

### The Second Place of the Second Division Football League will be Decided at the Kowloon Club, the Match between the Middlesex and the Fifth Battalion Artillery will Kick Off at 4 PM Today

[Our Newspaper Special] The various championship competitions held by the Football Association have been completed in order, including the Governor's Cup, Lai Wah Cup, Special Silver Plate, and International Cup. All these four championships were won by our Chinese team, and there is a tendency to completely win them all. If it becomes a reality, it is a great honor.

It is now the time when the football season is waning, but the issue of the First Division League Championship still needs to be finalized in the final battle between South China and the Navy before deciding who is the champion. This important battle has been rescheduled to be held at the Navy Ground at 4:30 pm on the 22nd of this month.

The Second Division League, since South China's last battle and defeat of Scott, has ascended to the top spot. However, due to the equal points of Middlesex and the Fifth Battalion Artillery, a final match is required to determine the second place.

This final match for second place will be held at the Kowloon Club at 4 pm today. Both teams attach great importance to this, because the second place is also an honor, and even cow dung is precious and cannot but be fought for.

A few days ago, in the Silver Plate Final, the performance of the Middlesex players was mediocre, especially the defense was weak, and they were defeated by Scott, finishing second. The players who will appear in the Middlesex team today are believed to be similar to those in the Silver Plate competition. It may not be easy to win against the Fifth Battalion Artillery, but the strength of the two teams is not far apart, and fierce competition is inevitable. The complete Second Division score sheet is recorded below (Football Field Taisui):

South China Club 22 18 2 2 64 24 38

Middlesex 22 18 1 3 82 30 37

Fifth Battalion Artillery 22 17 3 2 61 22 37

Scott Team 22 16 1 5 72 23 33

### Da Linzhen's Heroic Demeanor Still Exists, Lin Tiande Willingly Admits Defeat, Lin's Energy Deficit After Illness Leads to Two Consecutive Losses, He Li Group vs. Lin Zhen Brothers in Today's Doubles Semifinals

[Our Newspaper Special] In the Open Grass Tennis Tournament, Da Linzhen fought against Lin Tiande at the Hong Kong Cricket Club yesterday afternoon. Da Linzhen has been famous in the tennis world for more than ten years. Because of his increasing age, his bravery has diminished, but his rich experience still makes him an old hand. Lin is young and energetic, full of vigor, and has eliminated veteran Fencha, giving people a deep impression. Therefore, before the start of the game, the general audience thought that Lin had the possibility of defeating Da Linzhen. Unexpectedly, in the following game, Da Linzhen's courage still existed and he exerted it to the fullest. Lin was under his control, losing two sets in a row. Da Linzhen's smashes and slices could be used freely, and his volley attacks were also multi-handed. In addition, Lin's energy was greatly reduced after his illness, so it was inevitable to lose under the 付. In the first set, Lin was still able to calmly engage and repeatedly return the color, losing little. However, in the second set, Da Linzhen's smash was appropriate and his offensive was very strong. Lin's physical strength disappeared, and he was in a desperate situation. When the game was held until the score was two to three, Da Linzhen smashed even harder, and Lin could not resist it. The general trend was lost, and he lost four consecutive games. The overall result was that he lost in the sequel with a score of four to six and two to six.

### Overview of Yesterday's Battle

After the start of the game, Da Linzhen's momentum was great, winning two consecutive games. Lin's spirit was shaken, and his edge gradually appeared, with left and right baseline slices making repeated contributions. Da Linzhen, in view of Lin's hard work, did not dare to let up, or volleyed and attacked, or forcefully smashed from the baseline, with various tricks, which was more sophisticated and skillful than Lin's "one-way" baseline long slice. His superb skills can be seen from this. Therefore, under full play, he won the first set with a score of six to four.

In the second set, Da Linzhen took advantage of the victory and performed even more smoothly. Moreover, Lin had already suffered from going out to meet a strong enemy after his illness. Therefore, in response to the battle, the strength and heart were contrary. Although he once scored a score of two to three, which was quite tense, he was still inexperienced and had many flaws, which were repeatedly trapped by Da Linzhen. The technique of coping gradually became exhausted, and the strength was also unsustainable. The performance was clueless, and he was defeated again with two to six. This young warrior's fate in the singles match was thus concluded.

Da Linzhen wins Lin Tiande

Six to four

Six to two

Today's Game

There will be one doubles final today, with He Jialiu and Li Rurong against the Lin Zhen brothers. He Li defeated the strong Defu Pias last week, with great prestige. However, the Lin Zhen brothers have dominated the island for more than ten years and have won the doubles championship for eight consecutive terms. In the previous session, because the Xu family army stood out, they gave up the throne and finished second. However, their brotherly cooperation is customary, and their playing style is crisp and spicy. At present, apart from the Xu family army, there is no one who can challenge them. Therefore, although He Li's strength is not weak, compared with the Lin Zhen brothers, they are really inferior and cannot avoid defeat. However, it is expected that there will be many wonderful performances in the following battle.

Da Linzhen, Xiao Linzhen vs. He Jialiu, Li Rurong

### The Oriental Expeditionary Football Team Suffered a Miserable Defeat to the South Saka A Team, Losing With a Score of One to Nine Due to Tired Troops and Injured Generals

(Saigon, 18th Electric) The Hong Kong Oriental Football Team arrived here from Shuan Hua the day before yesterday. In the afternoon, they went out to fight the South Qi B Team. Although the East won by a large margin of seven to two, many team members were injured, and Miao Huaguo and Zhang Jinhai were especially seriously injured. Therefore, in the game against the South Qi A Team on the 17th, the strength was greatly affected due to tired troops and injured generals. After the start of the game, Nan Ji controlled the overall situation and did whatever he wanted. As a result, the East suffered a crushing defeat with a score of one to nine.

Note: The South Qi A Team is the only elite team in Vietnam. More than half of the members of the Bengon Team, which came to Hong Kong for competition last year, are the mainstay of the team. The South China team's southern tour in February this year was also defeated by the team. The strength of the team can be imagined. This time, the East's long expedition suffered a heavy blow, which is a more disastrous defeat record than any previous expedition by our Chinese team. The East's list of battles is as follows:

April 7th

Oriental Club Victory Hanoi Army Joint Team Four to Two

9th

Oriental Club Victory Tokyo B Team Three to Zero

10th

Oriental Club Tie Hanoi Joint Team Five to Five

13th

### A Few of the Most Effective Bedtime Exercises

— —Zhuoyue—

Generally, people tend to daydream for a few minutes after going to bed or waking up in the morning. Whether it's good or bad things, they keep thinking about them. Sometimes, they overthink, leading to insomnia or unwillingness to get out of bed in the morning. These bad habits have a very significant impact on both the mind and body. To avoid these drawbacks, it's definitely not effective to use force or self-awareness methods to restrain them. No matter how superior your intellect or how great your willpower, the results are minimal. The only fundamental and effective solution is to replace these habits with proper habits. Proper habits include going to bed and waking up on time, and having the habit of doing bedtime exercises before going to bed and before getting up. If you can develop the habit of doing these exercises, it will greatly help your mind, body, and career. However, there is one more thing to pay attention to: with any habit, everyone must have the determination to practice these exercises, without any interruption. If you continue persistently, you will naturally experience its benefits in your body and career. However, the amount of benefit you receive will be directly proportional to your effort. There will be no exceptions. Now, I will introduce a few of the most effective exercises:

(1) Leg Raising Exercise... As shown in the figure, lie on your back on the bed, stretch both arms straight by your head, and keep both legs straight with toes pointing forward. (1) Use force to raise your right leg upward, striving to make the thigh form the smallest angle with the torso, while keeping the left leg, torso, and upper limbs as close to the mattress as possible. (2) Slowly lower the right leg. (34) Repeat with the left leg. Do one to forty-eight repetitions.

(2) Hip Lifting Exercise As shown in the figure, lie on your back on the bed, with both arms at your sides and palms pressing on the mattress. Bend your knees high, raising them off the mattress, with feet pressing on the mattress and toes pointing upward. (1) Lift your back and hips off the mattress, striving to raise your hips as high as possible, inhaling deeply. At this time, only your shoulders and feet support the entire weight. (2) Exhale, slowly lower your hips and back back to the original position. Repeat this action up and down twenty times. (To be continued)

### Odds and Ends

International Game Revenue

Last weekend's international soccer final was held at the So Kon Po Recreation Ground. The Greater China team defeated the Portugal team by a score of nine to two, winning the championship. It is estimated that nearly ten thousand spectators attended the match. Ticket revenue totaled two thousand eight hundred and forty dollars, which will be allocated to charitable purposes. We are truly grateful to the players from both teams and the general audience for their immeasurable merit.

South China Singing Class

The Arts Department of the South China Athletic Association, to promote singing, has established a choir in addition to the existing public singing class, to cultivate basic singing talent. The choir has been established for several months, and the results have been excellent. Recently, many people from outside the association have requested to join. The association has decided to reorganize the choir, strive for further progress, and expand the number of members. All regulations will remain the same. Anyone who wishes to participate should register and take a voice test. If the association deems them qualified, they will be notified and required to pay a membership fee of one dollar when officially joining.

About Baseball Game

After the end of the soccer season, baseball games are on the rise. However, people in Hong Kong and China are not familiar with baseball rules, so they find it uninteresting. In fact, baseball is even more spectacular than soccer. Before the start of this year's baseball season, the editor of this column plans to write an article explaining how to watch a baseball game. If the audience understands everything, their interest will naturally increase.

Two Chinese Chairmen

The Chinese Swimming Club recently re-elected Guo Xian'an as chairman, but Guo declined, stating that he had already served three consecutive terms. After the club tried to retain him three times without success, the general meeting decided to publicly nominate vice chairman Xie Yuchuan to fill the position of chairman, and Wu Jianhou as vice chairman. Both men are well-known in society and enthusiastic about club affairs. It is expected that the club will make even greater progress in the future. The brief biographies of Xie and Wu are listed below: Xie is a local merchant, currently the Chinese manager of the German firm Beiersdorf & Co., and has served as vice chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Advancement Association, manager of the Panyu Chamber of Commerce, director of the Eastern District G section of the Hong Kong Air Defense Committee, and held key positions in various community organizations. He is extremely enthusiastic about sports. Wu is a wealthy businessman, owner of the Nanyang firm Yu Tao Ken Chong and Lee Fung Hong, and has served as director of various departments of the Chinese Club, providing strong support for club affairs. In recent years, Wu has also made significant donations to the Chinese Club's fundraising efforts for national salvation.

### Wartime Currency Situation in Fujian Province – Circulation Volume of National and Provincial Banknotes

The Fujian Provincial Bank was established in October of the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935). For three years, due to sufficient funds and good public credit, the people were happy to use its subsidiary currency. Currently, the subsidiary currency circulating in the market includes five denominations: 50 cents, 20 cents, 10 cents, 5 cents, and 1 cent. By the end of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), the total amount issued was over 12 million yuan, with the 50-cent note being the most common, reaching 10,364,741 yuan. The 10-cent note was the next most common, with a total value of 1,267,490 yuan. The 20-cent note was less common, with only 393,292.600 yuan. Last year, due to a shortage of copper coins in the market, a 5-cent note was added from November. As this was the beginning of issuance, it reached 52,500 yuan by the end of the year. This year, a 1-cent note was added. The printing cost is much higher than the face value, which shows that the bank is purely for facilitating the circulation of currency and not for profit. The bank's officials are focused on developing inland finance and assisting national banks, so the provincial bank's banknotes circulate widely in both national and provincial inland areas. People in large cities are happy to use the bank's banknotes to buy foreign exchange, and the bank also provides ample foreign exchange from the province. Of the 12 million yuan issued by the end of the 27th year of the Republic of China, the amounts returned to the treasury for foreign exchange purchases included 3,169,734.400 yuan in Fuzhou, 280,000 yuan in Jian'ou, 2,288,000 yuan in Hanjiang, 70,000 yuan in Sandu, 689,400 yuan in Saiqi, and 73,000 yuan in Xiapu, 116,000 yuan in Zhangzhou. Therefore, the actual amount of the bank's banknotes circulating in the market did not reach 8 million yuan. In February of this year, the reporter traveled to southern Jiangxi and learned that the Fujian Provincial Bank's subsidiary currency was circulating in that area in 67 counties. In Ruijin alone, it accounted for three-quarters of the total currency in circulation. Therefore, a portion of these 8 million yuan has actually flowed into other provinces. (To be continued)

### Sudden Change

— Jin Ge

"嗡—" An airplane circled overhead incessantly. Intermittently, there were "轟！轟！" bomb sounds, followed by the collapse of houses, a chaotic mess.

Everyone uneasily crawled out from their makeshift beds, crowded at the doorway, competing to look out through the five-inch square opening. In the dark, gloomy corridor, even the usually loud and bossy guards had vanished.

"Where are the people—where are the people—bastards! Crawled into some turtle hole! In the past, it was all your world, shouting and bossing people around, now you've slipped away? Damn it!" The robber Ah Xu violently pounded the door.

"I heard Dog Two (a guard) say that the fighting outside has been very fierce these past few days, not far from here! What to do!" The thief Wang Awan said worriedly to himself.

"嗡——轟—轟—" The plane was dropping bombs again.

"Amitabha, bombs should grow eyes, don't fall here! Spare my old dog life! Alas! Alas!" The opium peddler Shi Lao Si cried, then covered his head with the blanket again.

"If you're going to bomb, bomb you bastards who kill people without shedding blood—I, Ah Xu, fight openly, quickly and frankly, white blade in, red blade out! If you're going to die, then die, do you have that kind of guts? Urgh!" Ah Xu said fiercely.

"If I die, watch you not die. Alas, alas!" Shi Lao Si crawled out from under the blanket, but shrunk back in again.

"You say that! You say that! I'll beat you to death first, then talk." Ah Xu wanted to rush over to hit him, but Wang Acai and another thief, Ma Xin Gen, held him back.

"Old brother, why bother arguing with this old man!" Wang Acai advised Ah Xu, then turned back to Ma Xin Gen and said, "Dog Two even said the higher-ups are going to release us!"

"I'm not afraid of dying! But if you're going to die, then die quickly, fight with the Japanese devils, dying would save face. But I can't die confusedly, bombed to death by Japanese soldiers in jail, how am I supposed to explain that to the King of Hell, and to my fierce old man!" Ah Xu muttered to himself, then he pounded on the door, yelling, "Bastards! Open the door!"

Suddenly, a burst of hurried footsteps came from the corridor. Ah Xu looked out through the opening and saw Dog Two leading the way, followed by seven or eight soldiers, walking over. He couldn't help but burst out cursing, "Bastards! You've come! I thought you were all holed up in turtle holes! Open the door, let me go fight the Japanese devils!" He then violently pounded on the door.

"Stop making noise! The warden's coming to release you dogs!"

Dog Two's words were very loud, almost every cell clearly heard. The prisoners were so happy they couldn't close their mouths! Everyone was busy, anxious.

A moment later, the warden arrived. Dog Two, Chen Liangcai, and other guards, along with more than ten soldiers.

"Number Thirty-four, seventeen people; Number Thirty-five, sixteen people; Number Thirty-six..." The warden read from the ledger, Dog Two unlocked the chains, Chen Liangcai counted the people.

Over a thousand prisoners filled the entire corridor. The warden stood on a stool at the exit and said loudly, "The war situation outside is very tight, the Japanese are not far from here. I have been ordered to release you! Some of you have been here for ten or twenty years, some for three or five years, everyone has been able to live by the rules. The state has treated you well. Now that you are being released, I hope that you will reform after leaving prison, and not commit crimes again! Be good people! Be worthy of the nation and your ancestors! Okay! You can go now. Don't push or shove when you leave, don't crowd together, the Japanese planes will drop bombs if they see you!"

Ah! A cheer erupted from the hearts of over a thousand people, then everyone started moving their feet. At this moment, Ah Xu stepped forward and said loudly:

"Wait a moment! I, Ah Xu, also have a few words to say: I, Ah Xu, used to be a robber! Black guns, white knives, red blood, I've played with them all. I should have died dozens of times! But now I'm still alive. I've been in here for thirteen years, I can recite every tile, every brick. The state has supported me for thirteen years, treating me well. In the past, we wronged the nation the most! Now, what can we use to repay our nation? Our homes have been destroyed by the Japanese devils, the fields have turned into wasteland, wives and daughters have been raped, what's left of our homes! Let's fight the Japanese devils to the death! Killing one is enough. Killing one more is a profit! Those with guts, follow me, Ah Xu!"

"I'm with you! We're with you! Me! Me!" Hundreds of thunderous voices.

Ah Xu led the way, followed by hundreds of brave men, an iron team, an iron torrent, going out of prison!

### Night of Damaijiao

— Shen Si

A March on the West Bank of the Fen River

Night has passed again, dense artillery fire falls upon our hearts; separated by a mountain, we await the war.

From morning until noon, we maintained contact with the Japanese forces; fierce artillery fire flew into the mountains, we left a small number of men on the mountain to pin down the Japanese main force, occasionally firing quick shots at the highway below; crossing a mountain, our main force ambushed behind the Japanese. The piercingly cold wind, carrying the scent of blood and gunpowder, flowed across the battlefield.

The important town in western Shanxi, surrounded by ten thousand mountains, crouched withered and exhausted at the foot of the mountains, without even a sigh.

This is a support point on the western front, and has been occupied by the Japanese for two days.

The desolation that people can imagine cannot evoke any feeling of desolation here. The tragedy of human faces is not death; we do not sigh and grieve for death; the tragedy of humanity is when the hatred in the depths of the heart is unearthed, and their enemies cannot be found; in distant places, the enemies are indulging in wanton acts……

When I saw those victims (our compatriots and northeastern compatriots who were forced to come to their own country by Japanese fascist bandits to carry out crazy massacres). I thought, this is the tragedy of humanity!

Late at night, I returned from there, walking past the corpses; the waning moon hung in the chaotic mountains, the town was silent; I suddenly remembered the Song dynasty poet’s lines, “Ghostly wails remain with the waning moon. Burnt villages leave not a single chicken.”

The Japanese even left behind flour, pork,…… which made us a sumptuous dinner.

"It might be poisoned, don't eat it!" I stopped them.

The aroma of pork mischievously entangled me. Finally, I myself began to greedily eat it.

### A Casual Talk on Three-Primary-Color Panchromatic Film

— Xin Ying

The invention of three-primary-color panchromatic film is a major revolution in the history of film after the prevalence of sound films. Recently, "Flying Together," which was shown in Shanghai, is MGM's first three-primary-color panchromatic film; at the same time, I heard that the Soviet Union's first three-primary-color panchromatic film "Nightingale" will also be shown in Shanghai soon. Here, the author wants to write about the various situations of three-primary-color films below for readers.

The current panchromatic films are different in color compared to the previous films. The current ones are much more advanced. The main reason is that the previous color films were shot with two primary colors. Three-primary-color films were invented in 1932 and succeeded after careful research by many people.

So-called natural color films are actually three-primary-color films. If you want to strictly define a boundary, then natural color films are only a part of three-primary-color films. That is, using natural scenery to shoot panchromatic films, every flower and grass shows its color on the screen, and there is no difference from the natural color tone. If you shoot purely natural color films, the camera is completely shot outdoors, then the director's work will be much easier, because the scenery is not needed. After the invention of the three-primary-color film, the first attempt was with Disney's Mickey Mouse films, because Mickey Mouse films are all short films, and even if the attempt fails, the loss is relatively small. Who knew that the result of the attempt was a great success. From then on, the general film audience felt that Mickey Mouse black and white films were plain and tasteless, which resulted in Mickey Mouse cartoons being non-color. Until the recent production of the Mickey Mouse feature-length panchromatic film "Snow White", it was a major achievement of three-primary-color cartoons. After the three-primary-color film was successfully tried in Mickey Mouse cartoons, the various film companies in Hollywood began to pay attention to this color film. All scripts, stories, and themes that are suitable for shooting three-primary-color panchromatic films are shot in color. In our memory, the success of "Vanity Fair," "The Trail of the Lonesome Pine," "Ramona," and "Snow White," is very large in terms of color gains.

Now, film companies in various countries are also engaged in shooting this new type of color film, but in fact, shooting the same film in three-primary-color panchromatic film costs more than black and white film. This is a limitation of material conditions. Therefore, although three-primary-color panchromatic films have been invented for seven or eight years, we still rarely see one in the cinema, unlike sound films, which are almost all sound films shortly after their invention.

### The Path of the Creator

— Ding Di

We walk a difficult journey amidst hardship.

There is no road, no boundary marker, no flat blue stones, no stairs for climbing. The journey is distant and arduous! Don’t you see the sweat dripping from our brows and our hands and feet covered in calluses? The human ingenuity, enthusiasm, and courage that were advanced to us, all the strength we possess, we use to struggle like a lion.

Having waded through a long journey, a whole day, a whole night, a heavy stream, a heavy pass, following our footsteps, creating a long, wide "thoroughfare."

We have crossed county halls, we have scaled dangerous cliffs, we have meandered through winding sheep's intestines, we have cut through lurking brigands in the deep forest, we have searched for water sources in the desolate wilderness, we have listened to the frightening wind on precipitous, perilous paths. We have experienced many dangers and hardships, all fear seems insignificant, and the miraculous seems commonplace. The history of life is filled with greatness and magnificence, our bodies, standing tall as the sky, digging and hoeing. With orderly steps, let our sweat drip onto our bodies, let us exchange hardship for a smooth "thoroughfare."

Without hardship, where would joy come from? Having waded through a long journey, a whole day, a whole night, a heavy stream, a heavy pass, scattered rocks hinder our steps, thorns pierce our toes, mud stains our clothes, weathered by the desert wind and sand, trapped by wolves and tigers at night, while staggering and falling on treacherous paths, we also open up a smooth path for travelers coming after us. Indeed, our work is arduous. But, what does this matter? Each of us has a destination, we must traverse the plains and also climb the mountain peak that reaches the sky. At the summit of the mountain, the end of the journey, there we see a happy "paradise", where we enjoy the air of freedom, break free from the shackles of pain, and recover from long-term fatigue.

From the beginning, this journey has never been opened up. A traveler often cannot withstand the miasma of the wild smoke, or lacks the strength to kill venomous snakes and beasts, quietly resting in the ground, exposing white bones in the wilderness, and the timid regard it as a "dangerous path", although they know there is a blissful mountain peak, but ultimately have no courage to overcome these numerous dangers.

Thus, the "dangerous path" becomes a world where jackals run rampant, the weak are subjected to the strong, and the gentle are subjected to greed and violence.

Thousands of years later, hundreds of millions of years later, it is our turn today to walk this difficult journey. Not lazy, not discouraged, not surrendered, not begging for mercy, straighten our backs, grasp the hoe and plow, open up a smooth road, for ourselves, for our descendants, and also for our friends.

The journey is distant and arduous! There is no road, no boundary marker, no flat blue stones, no stairs for climbing. From evil, we create justice; from nature, we carve out miracles and divine craftsmanship.

Do not worry about getting lost on the divergent path. Look, the mountain peak is already level with our eyebrows. Paradise is also in sight. No need to chatter idly. Just exert your last bit of strength, and you will have already climbed the mountain peak.

Follow in our footsteps. The long "thoroughfare" is created, retreating behind us, traversing the plains, and also climbing the mountain peak.

"The arduous traveler is also the glorious creator!"

Later travelers will point to the "thoroughfare" and thank their struggling predecessors.

### The Snow of Manchuria

— Shu Qun

These words, her reaction to them, were ordinary comfort; but to her comrades, the feeling was completely vague, mysterious. Therefore, among the comrades, some could not help but think:

"Do you love her? Loving too quickly, love is difficult to last long." Or:

"Love is free, but you cannot indulge it and hinder your work!"

After he told his comrades everything that happened between himself and her, they still suspected it was not the truth, but rather a bizarre story that was almost deliberately created, but from her tacit acquiescence, they could not help but believe it. Thus, they all gave him admiring glances, praising his unexpected success. For her, this was exactly the opposite - an unexpected failure; resentment? Too late, crying; the tears of the weak are often self-comforting. Her comfort, on the contrary, aroused his concern, in order to reassure her, he led her into another room - the next room, except for the wall door, there was no second door; if going out, one must pass through the wall door, and the room outside the wall. But there were many windows, tall and wide, and double-layered glass; between them, there was a distance of more than a foot, filled with cold-proof sawdust and cotton - above, there were also black charcoal and red flowers. From the window heads, purple velvet curtains were hanging; these curtains could cover all the secrets in the room. The two places between the windows, in order to cater to the different personalities of the tenants, the landlord hung two uncoordinated famous paintings: "The Last Supper" and "The Angelus." In addition, the furnishings loved by a noble girl were quite complete, such as: a springy small bed, a long dressing mirror, a comfortable sofa and armchair. The most indispensable dressing table...and also several bunches of bright flowers in a vase to embellish people's empty souls! Inspiring people, tempting people with youthful ideals, dreamlike, or providing solace to the melancholic, or accompanying the lonely and dispelling loneliness, he led her to these flowers, he said:

"These are to write about you buying."

Then, he picked a flower again, and inserted it between her hair strands; she used her hand to readjust the position, she said:

"This flower is really beautiful."

(Forty-one)
